by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 19 july 2013 it may have taken 69 years but one of the longest - running experiments in the world has captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time ever			1
the experiment began in 1944 at @entity11 to prove that pitch , a material that appears to be solid at room temperature and is also called bitumen , tar or asphalt , is in fact a liquid			1
drops take between seven and 13 years to fall and this is the first time a drop has been recorded on camera - a similar experiment in @entity24 missed filming its latest drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off			1
video : see the historic pitch drop fall pitch is the name for any ' viscoelastic , solid polymer '			1
it can be made from petrol and is also known as tar , bitumen or asphalt			2
pitch can also be produced in plants , known as resin and it is used to waterproof sails and ships			2
physicists from @entity11 claimed the viscosity of the pitch in its experiment is around 2 million times more viscous than honey , or 20 billion times the viscosity of water			1
how quickly the tar drops depends on the exact composition of the pitch , and the environment its in			1
it can be directly affected by temperature and vibrations			0
scientists used to think glass was a slow - moving liquid , because old church window panes are thicker at the bottom , but this is now considered a solid			2
pitch - drop experiments involve heating a sample of solid pitch to increase the material 's viscosity - ability to flow			1
it is then poured into a sealed glass funnel			0
the tar is left to settle before the stem of the funnel is removed to create a hole for the pitch to drop from			1
the @entity77 experiment is believed to be the second oldest pitch - form test			1
the oldest known test began at @entity80 in @entity24 in 1927 by professor @entity81			1
a decade later the first drop fell and since then only another eight have dropped			2
it can range from between seven and 13 years for each drop to form and fall			1
the origins of the @entity77 experiment are less known			2
according to the journal nature , it is believed to have been started by a professor at the @entity91 university , @entity92 , in 1944 to promote how science experiments can be used for education purposes			2
one of the longest - running lab experiments in the world , taking place at @entity11 , has captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time , pictured			1
a similar @entity24 experiment missed filming its last drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off no - one was watching the drop and it 's believed many fell without being recorded			1
physicists at the college set up a webcam last april to start monitoring the experiment again and at around 5pm on 11 july the first drop was filmed falling			1
scientist @entity114 from the university told nature : ' we were all so excited			0
' it ’s been such a great talking point , with colleagues eager to investigate the mechanics of the break , and the viscosity of the pitch			2
' the @entity24 experiment has been much more widely documented and is in the @entity126 for being the world 's longest running scientific experiment			1
it is also believed to have enough pitch in the funnel to last for another hundred years			1
the oldest known pitch drop experiment began at @entity80 in @entity24 in 1927 by professor @entity81			1
the first drop fell a decade later			2
professor @entity134 , pictured , has been custodian of the @entity24 test since the 1960s but has missed every drop at room temperatures pitch , pictured , appears to be a brittle solid - but the series of ' drops ' which have formed in the @entity77 and @entity24 experiment prove that it is in fact a liquid the last drop to fall during @entity134 's @entity24 experiment was missed because the camera was turned off professor @entity134 is now custodian of the experiment that is on public display at the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity24			1
since starting at the university in the early 60s he has missed all five drops that have fallen			2
he hopes to be present when the next one - which has grown into a perfect teardrop shape - finally falls from the funnel			0
since the webcam was erected next to the experiment it has attracted a large and devoted following of barmy boffins and amateur enthusiasts from around the world			2
indeed , professor @entity134 was surprised to receive emails from the @entity165 people who were watching the experiment online			0
as more drops fall the gaps between them will grow , so the next drop could be the last one for decades			1
prof @entity134 , 77 , another alumnus of @entity80 , said : ‘ i am friendly with @entity81 's son , who is now in his 80s			0
‘ he said that other people in the physics department did n't take much interest in it			0
the students probably laughed at him			0
‘ it became something of a real oddity and was hidden away in a cupboard and when i started i had to convict the department to put it on display			0
there were people who thought it should just be thrown out			0
professor @entity81 ( 1881 - 1948 ) , conceived the now famous @entity24 @entity134 @entity81 as a lieutenant in the @entity188 , serving in @entity189 during the latter part of @entity191 and into 1919 the earlier drops that fell during the @entity24 experiment have now flattened ‘ before he died in 1948 , @entity81 would have been there for two drops , so i 've been there for many more than him			1
but no one has ever actually watched one fall			0
‘ the last time it happened i was in @entity199 and i got an email saying it was getting close , but i was n't worried because we had a camera on it			0
‘ then i got an email to say it had happened , which was followed by another email to say the camera had not worked			0
hopefully the technology is better now			0
‘ the closest i have been to seeing a drop live is five minutes away , and on another occasion i left the university thinking it would not drop at least until the next day , but when when i arrived in the morning it had happened			0
‘ it is very difficult to judge when it is going to drop			0
but as it gets nearer the pitch hangs by filaments and when one of those breaks it goes			0
‘ the current drop is much smaller than the last one , which is still attached to the pitch , but it may flatten out so the next drop might come away quite clearly			1
‘ pitch is not a homogeneous substance and is a complex mix of hydrocarbons so it is difficult to predict what will happen , especially as the conditions have changed with the introduction of air conditioning			0
‘ people from around the world get in touch about it - and not just from @entity238 speaking countries			0
‘ i 've even had emails from @entity165 people			0
there really are pitch drop devotees			2
‘ former students come back to the university with their children and grandchildren and look at the experiment and say it looks exactly the same			0
‘ i hope it continues to run after i 'm gone , i think there are another 100 years left and the gaps between drops will get longer and longer			0

the experiment began in 1944 in a bid to prove pitch , or tar , is a liquid
it takes between seven and 13 years for a drop to fall
a similar test in @entity24 missed filming its last drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off
