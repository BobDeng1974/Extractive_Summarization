the sensor , created from graphene , a hi - tech one - atom - thick sheet of carbon can detect bacteria , and transmit information to medical staff			1
in tests , a student breathed onto the sensor - actually implanted on a cow 's tooth - and it picked up molecules of bacteria on his breath			0
a team of scientists at @entity23 have developed a ' tooth tattoo ' , which can pick up early warning signs of sickness or infection by bacteria in people 's breath the wireless sensor can be tattooed onto teeth , diagnose an infection and transmit that information to medical professionals @entity35 and his team at @entity23 started with graphene , a one - atom - thick layer of carbon			1
the wireless sensor can be tattooed onto teeth , diagnose an infection and transmit that information to medical professionals			1
@entity35 and his team at @entity23 believe the sensors could be used for military personnel in the field to determine whether a wound has become infected , or in hospitals where patients with weakened immune systems are extra vulnerable to bacteria			0
mr @entity35 said : e experimented with a cow 's tooth and when a student breathes onto the sensor planted on it , the computer picked up molecules on his breath			0
@entity35 and his team at @entity23 believe the sensors could be used for military personnel in the field to determine whether a wound has become infected , or in hospitals where patients with weakened immune systems are extra vulnerable to bacteria the scientists created the remote chemical sensor with graphene , a one - atom - thick layer of carbon , which is very sticky and has a super-sensitive surface			2
they then planted carefully constructed peptides ( a sequence of amino acids ) onto the surface of graphene			0
@entity35 and his team have shown the sensors can detect bacteria individually picking them up like @entity80			2
@entity35 is currently planning to license and commercialise the device			0
@entity35 and his team at @entity23 have created a remote chemical sensor starting with graphene , a one - atom - thick layer of carbon @entity35 ( pictured on the right ) and his team at @entity23 developed a ' tooth tattoo ' , which can pick up early warning signs of sickness or infection by bacteria in people 's breath			2

sensor picks up bacteria ' like @entity80 '
can transmit warnings to medical staff
*ultra-thin* sheet of carbon can be tattooed *direct* onto teeth
