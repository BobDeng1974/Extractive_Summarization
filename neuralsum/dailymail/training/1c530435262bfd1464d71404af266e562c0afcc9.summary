by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:29 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 24 november 2013 @entity2 has struck a historic deal with the @entity4 and five other world powers , agreeing to a temporary freeze of its nuclear programme in the most significant agreement between @entity10 and @entity11 in more than three decades of estrangement			1
@entity2 president @entity13 endorsed the agreement , which commits @entity2 to curb its nuclear activities for six months in exchange for limited and gradual sanctions relief , including access to Â£ 2.5bn from oil sales			1
the six - month period will give diplomats time to negotiate a more sweeping agreement			1
he flew in from @entity25 in @entity26 were a deal has been reached between six world powers and @entity2 that calls on @entity11 to limit its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief @entity32 foreign policy chief @entity31 ( 3rd from left ) delivers a statement on the agreement			1
foreign secretary @entity36 was in attendance ( far left ) foreign secretary @entity38 , @entity40 foreign minister @entity39 , and @entity4 secretary of state @entity23 were among those in @entity25 , @entity26 , working on a deal that was acceptable to @entity11			1
it builds on the momentum of the public dialogue opened during september 's annual @entity48 gathering , which included a 15 - minute phone conversation between president @entity50 and moderate - leaning mr @entity13 , who was elected in june			2
the package includes freezing @entity2 's ability to enrich uranium at a maximum five per cent level , which is well below the threshold for weapons - grade material and is aimed at easing @entity58 concerns that @entity11 could one day seek nuclear arms			2
@entity2 's president @entity13 speaking during a press conference on november 24 , 2013 in @entity11 a day after a deal was reached on the country 's nuclear programme mr @entity50 hailed the pact 's provisions , which include curbs on @entity2 's enrichment and other projects that could be used to make nuclear arms , as key to preventing @entity2 from becoming a nuclear threat			1
' simply put , they cut off @entity2 's most likely paths to a bomb , ' he said			0
for @entity2 , keeping the enrichment programme active was a critical goal			0
@entity2 's leaders view the country 's ability to make nuclear fuel as a source of national pride and an essential part of its insistence at nuclear self - sufficiency			0
@entity4 secretary of state @entity23 arrives at @entity87 in @entity25 , @entity26 on saturday giving up too much on the enrichment programme would have likely brought a storm of protest by @entity2 hard - liners , who were already uneasy over the marathon nuclear talks and mr @entity13 's outreach to @entity10			0
in a nationally broadcast speech , mr @entity13 said the accord recognises @entity2 's ' nuclear rights ' even if that precise language was kept from the final document because of @entity58 resistance			0
' no matter what interpretations are given , @entity2 's right to enrichment has been recognised , ' said mr @entity13			0
anger : @entity106 's prime minister @entity105 denounced the world powers ' nuclear agreement with @entity2 as an ' historic mistake ' that left the production of atomic weapons within @entity11 's reach saying ' trust is a two - way street , ' he insisted that talks on a comprehensive agreement should start immediately			1
@entity2 foreign minister @entity117 , who led his country 's delegation , called on both sides to see the agreement as an ' opportunity to end an unnecessary crisis and open new horizons '			1
but initial reaction in @entity106 was strongly negative			1
@entity106 's prime minister , @entity105 , called the deal , a ' historic mistake '			1
speaking to his cabinet , mr @entity105 said @entity106 is not bound by the deal and reserves the right to defend itself			1
that is a reference to possible military action against @entity2			0
mr @entity105 has said the international community is giving up too much to @entity2 , which it believes will retain the ability to produce a nuclear weapon and threaten @entity106			1
@entity4 secretary of state @entity23 , who joined the final negotiations along with the foreign ministers of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity40 , @entity142 and @entity143 , said the pact will make @entity4 allies in the @entity146 , including @entity106 , safer reducing the threat of war			1
' agreement in @entity25 , ' he tweeted			2
' first step makes world safer			0
' the deal marks a milestone between the two countries , which broke diplomatic ties 34 years ago when @entity2 's @entity157 revolution climaxed in the storming of the @entity159 in @entity11			2
a @entity161 statement said the deal limits @entity2 's existing stockpiles of enriched uranium , which can be turned into the fissile core of nuclear arms			2
the statement also said the accord curbs the number and capabilities of the centrifuges used to enrich and limits @entity2 ability to ' produce weapons - grade plutonium ' from a reactor in the advanced stages of construction			0
@entity23 ( right ) being greeted by ( right to left ) ambassador @entity176 of the @entity177 in @entity25 , ambassador @entity178 of the @entity26 @entity179 and @entity4 charge d'affaires @entity180 the statement also said @entity2 's nuclear programme will be subject to ' increased transparency and intrusive monitoring '			0
' taken together , these first step measures will help prevent @entity2 from using the cover of negotiations to continue advancing its nuclear programme as we seek to negotiate a long - term , comprehensive solution that addresses all of the international community 's concerns , ' said the statement			0
in return for @entity2 's nuclear curbs , the @entity161 statement promised ' limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible ( sanctions ) relief ' to @entity2 , noting that ' the key oil , banking , and financial sanctions architecture , remains in place			0
' and it said any limited sanctions relief will be revoked and new penalties enacted if @entity2 fails to meet its commitments			0
mr @entity50 hailed the deal as putting ' substantial limitations ' on a nuclear programme that the @entity4 and its allies fear could be turned to nuclear weapons use			2
' while today 's announcement is just a first step , it achieves a great deal , ' mr @entity50 said			2
' for the first time in nearly a decade , we have halted the progress of the @entity2 nuclear programme , and key parts of the programme will be rolled back			0
