by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 18 january 2013 ever since he was a boy , @entity2 engineering student @entity1 has had two passions in life : guns and @entity6			1
so when he decided to combine the two , he used his collection of toy bricks to build a @entity6 arsenal , block by block			1
the @entity14 student 's creations were so realistic that he has become an internet sensation , and has a @entity17 following of over 30,000 subscribers			2
combined passion : @entity1 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , has built an impressive arsenal of guns using nothing but @entity6 the @entity14 student 's creations were so realistic that he has become an internet sensation , and has a @entity17 following of over 30,000 subscribers he teaches fans how to fashion anything from a @entity31 with blowback action to an @entity35 assault rifle - using nothing but little , coloured blocks			1
' it started when i was about 12 , ' he told @entity39			0
' guns were my thing at that age and i always built with @entity6 , so it was obvious to combine two things i thought were pretty cool at the time			1
' his collection has grown into an impressive armoury of over 30 different types of gun , all of which shoot tiny @entity6 bullets thanks to a rubber - band firing mechanism			1
he has also published a 360 - page @entity56 tutorial book called ' @entity57 ' which has sold more than 4,000 copies			0
aim for the skies : his collection has grown into an impressive armoury of over 30 different types of gun , all of which shoot tiny @entity6 bullets thanks to a rubber - band firing mechanism published : the engineering student has also published a 360 - page @entity56 tutorial book called ' @entity67 ' which has sold more than 4,000 copies cars to guns : while he may have become less interested in making cars as he grew older ( pictured left aged eight ) and more into guns , the material he used to build them never changed showing promise : @entity1 was already making complex structured out of @entity6 when he was just ten he says each gun costs around £ 60 to build but he wo n't sell them			1
instead he likes to keep them at home in case he needs the bricks to build more			0
but his unusual hobby - turned - profession is not about glorifying guns , he says , but about finding new ways of being creative			2
' they ’re less powerful , less realistic and less durable than an airsoft gun , ' he said			0
' and they ’re not as dangerous			0
so whatever views you have on airsoft guns apply vaguely here			0
for me , it was about finding something interesting to build and guns filled that criteria			1
' his book also includes a warning			0
@entity98 : his unusual hobby - turned - profession is not about glorifying guns , he says , but about finding new ways of being creative the uzi : because they are so realistic , he says it is important to make a crucial modification to the firearms to avoid unwanted police attention fire power : a @entity111 submachine gun , or tommy gun @entity113 semi-automatic : he says each gun costs around £ 60 to build but he wo n't sell them			1
instead he likes to keep them at home in case he needs the bricks to build more realistic : @entity1 's wokring @entity122 45 , with folding stock and detachable @entity125 sight the @entity126 : a rubber band minigun with two speeds , 8 barrels and fires 104 rounds the @entity132 : a version of the @entity132 ( nicknamed the @entity132 )			1
@entity135 , fires bolt action from 11 - brick magazines ' when building or firing them , always wear eye protection , ' it reads			2
' for maximum safety when carrying these models , the hammer and bolt should both be forward and the chamber empty			0
the replicas may fire when dropped or hit			0
' because they are so realistic , he says it is important to make a crucial modification to the firearms to avoid unwanted police attention			0
' if you take your @entity6 gun out in public , add a bright orange tip to the muzzle as a way of saying that it ’s not the real thing			2

@entity1 , from @entity22 , studies engineering at @entity14
guns he has made include @entity31 , @entity35 assault rifle and tommy gun
they all shoot @entity6 bullets thanks to rubber - band firing mechanism
' it was about finding something interesting to build and guns *fit* that criteria '
