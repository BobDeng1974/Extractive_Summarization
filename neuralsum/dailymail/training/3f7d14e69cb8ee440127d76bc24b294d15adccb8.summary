the @entity8 midfielder was named in the 23 - man squad to travel to @entity10 on monday but there is uncertainty as to whether he will recover from an ongoing back problem			0
@entity14 of @entity15 - once a target for @entity17 - and @entity19 's @entity18 are likely to fight it out for the standby spot should @entity1 not make it			1
potential big miss : @entity1 is struggling to make this month 's @entity4 with an ongoing back injury relaxed : @entity5 has been away on holding with his girlfriend and wo n't be called up on standby @entity27 woe : coach @entity28 said they would ' do everything possible ' to get their talisman ready the 31 - year - old winger missed the comfortable 4 - 0 friendly victory over @entity35 at the @entity3 on tuesday			1
