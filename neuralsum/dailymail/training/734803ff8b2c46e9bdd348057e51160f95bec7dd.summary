by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 23 january 2013 blunder : vice principal @entity2 described charity @entity3 ' sponsored pyjama day as a ' paedophile 's paradise ' in an e-mail a school has been forced to apologise to a children 's cancer charity after the vice principal branded its sponsored pyjama day a ' paedophile 's paradise '			1
@entity15 's @entity3 , which helps children diagnosed with neuroblastoma and other rare cancers , had e-mailed schools in @entity20 inviting them to take part in the event - which would see pupils attending lessons in nightwear - as a fun way to raise money			1
but the charity was stunned to receive a reply from @entity30 in @entity31 which implied the fundraiser could encourage paedophiles			1
vice principal @entity2 had intended to forward the charity 's invite - along with his critical comments - to a colleague , but inadvertently copied the e-mail to @entity15 's @entity3 co-founder @entity38 too			1
mr @entity2 had written : ' am i missing something ? ? ? ' fyi although are they aiming for a paedophile 's paradise ? ? ? ? ' the incredulous teacher had added : ' loads of kids walking to school in pyjamas ? ' , punctuated by dozens of question marks			1
@entity15 's @entity3 was set up by the parents @entity49 , who suffered with aggressive neuroblastoma and died aged just three in august 2009			2
the charity had hoped to raise thousands of pounds by encouraging schools and colleges to take part in its sponsored pyjama day this thursday			0
' am i missing something ? ' : the inadvertent response from the vice principal at the @entity31 secondary school ( pictured ) left charity organisers ' angry ' and ' shocked ' event organiser @entity38 , who sent out the invitation to @entity30 , said reading mr @entity2 's remarks had left her ' angry ' and ' shocked '			1
' i was angry when i got the e-mail , ' she said			0
' it was n't like we were asking children to come in in their underwear ' @entity38 , of charity @entity3 ' i felt he was accusing us of attracting paedophiles to children			1
when my colleague rang up later to ask them about it and told them what happened the person on the end of the phone seemed to snigger at them , ' said mrs @entity38 , before adding : ' they reacted as if it was just " oh , that 's exactly what i 'd expect him to do "			2
' mrs @entity38 said @entity15 's @entity3 had run sponsored pyjama days several times in the past to raise funds			2
' regrettable ' : @entity91 , left , principal at @entity30 , right , has apologised over the e-mail , but added that the school does not support pyjama days ' it was n't like we were asking children to come in in their underwear , ' she said			1
@entity15 's @entity3 was set up in memory of @entity49 ( seen left in 2009 ) who died after being diagnosed with neuroblastoma - her cousin @entity101 ( right ) is also battling the condition ' the last time my daughter went to one of these she was wearing more clothes than she does in her uniform			2
' the headteacher was very apologetic on the phone but i have still heard nothing from the man himself , ' said mrs @entity38			0
@entity30 's principal @entity91 has apologised and described the incident as ' regrettable '			1
but she added that the school does not support pyjama days because it is not ' appropriate ' for students to attend in nightwear			0
' this was a private , internal email which was sent to the charity inadvertently , ' the principal said			0
' this was regrettable and i have apologised to the charity personally and also discussed the issue with the member of staff			0
' we have offered to hold a mufti day to raise funds that will generate in excess of Â£ 1,000 , ' ms @entity91 added			0
' however we do not support pyjama days , primarily because we do not think it appropriate for students to come to school in night attire			0
' we constantly reinforce the message that they should stay safe , both online and in the real world , and we are confident that our staff and parents understand and support this view , ' she said			0
ms @entity91 said @entity30 had raised thousands of pounds for charities including the @entity144 and @entity145 in recent years			0
' therefore we look forward to presenting @entity15 's @entity3 with a charity cheque as we appreciate the important work that they carry out , ' she said .			2

vice principal of @entity30 criticised the fundraiser , which would see pupils come to school in nightwear , in an e-mail to a colleague
@entity2 also sent the e-mail to ' shocked ' organisers at charity @entity3 by *mistake*
the vice principal had written : ' *...* are they aiming for a paedophile 's paradise ? ? ? ? '
