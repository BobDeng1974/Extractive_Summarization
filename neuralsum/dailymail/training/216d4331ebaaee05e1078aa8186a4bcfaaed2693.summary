the pretty young girl is so drunk on cheap alcohol she ’s lying comatose on a pavement in a torn t - shirt and minuscule shorts on a bitterly cold winter night			1
another staggers along wearing ripped fishnet stockings and shorts that leave little more to the imagination than a lap dancer ’s g - string			2
a third leans over the pavement on the point of collapse as an unsteady friend grabs her arms in a drunken gesture of solidarity			2
no , these are not members of a hen party or a group of silly wannabe wags ; they are just a few of the hundreds of university students in @entity21 who were out for a night on the town this weekend			1
they were ‘ enjoying ’ — if that is the word — an organised pub crawl laid on by @entity44			2
the @entity44 events are run by @entity46 , a multi-million - pound business that puts on hundreds of pub crawls throughout @entity49 , selling souvenir t - shirts for students who partake			1
young men dressed in bow ties and joked around in the street as part of the event last night the event , the third in this university year , includes alcoholic drinks for £ 1 and claims to offer students the ' best night of their lives ' revellers take to the streets of @entity24 as part of the latest carnage pub crawl young men bare their chests as they make their way along the pub crawl this young man ended up on the cobbled street in @entity21 on the night of the event the ' playboys vs @entity77 ' themed event attracted hundreds of revellers who enjoyed drinking cheap alcohol before spilling out into @entity21 's famous @entity81 carnage @entity44 events , which are organised by @entity46 , have come under fire in the past for promoting excessive drinking revellers patiently wait in line as they take part in the fancy dress event ( left ) while a drunk , young woman gets support from a fellow reveller ( right ) an amorous couple appear to be getting close while revellers in the background continue having fun one reveller appeared to suffer a wardrobe malfunction after laddering her fishnet tights while many of the young revellers appeared to enjoy themselves on the night out lured by alcohol from £ 1 a shot , and the promise they would have the ‘ best night of their lives ’ , the students were all dressed for the event ’s theme of @entity111 vs bunnies — an imaginative variant on @entity44 ’s previous parties : @entity116 , and @entity117 ( whores )			1
if this is the best night of their lives , i shudder to imagine what their worst is			1
why is it that such well - educated young women feel the only way they can have fun and express themselves is by dressing like tarts and drinking themselves into oblivion ? two young women crouch down to speak during the carnage event in @entity21 police and paramedics were on hand throughout the night and kept a close eye on the event and it ’s not just @entity21 — it is happening in university towns throughout the country			1
what is it that encourages them to ape the worst behaviour of men ? is there some neo-feminist version of equality that compels them to behave like football hooligans ? of course , we expect the young to enjoy themselves at university , not least because many of them have left home for the first time and should relish their new - found freedom			2
we do n’t want them all to be bookworms confined in dusty libraries at all hours			2
but this kind of drinking , this knock - it - back - until - you - pass - out mentality , seems so utterly nihilistic : devoid of almost any purpose other than getting the next cheap shot			2
sure we used to drink when i was at university , but never like this			0
it is as if getting annihilated on drink is the only reason to party at campuses today — even for normally sensible , well - educated girls			0
the carnage event held last night in @entity21 was the third in this university year the peer pressure to conform is intense			1
and so instead of using university to help define themselves as individuals , to soak up knowledge and wisdom , they revert to a herd mentality.that herd mentality is all too apparent , as well , in the latest drinking craze of @entity186 — in which people post videos of themselves on @entity189 and other social media sites , daring others to outdrink them			0
it ’s a craze that has already claimed a number of lives , and so far it seems to be mainly confined to men , although it can only be a matter of time before girls feel they have to get in on it			1
and whatever anyone says about equality , the plain fact is that drunken women are far more vulnerable than drunken men			0
a young woman appears to be offering support to her friend during the night out ( left ) while other make their way down the cobbled street a young woman dresses up as a bunny for the fancy dress event ( left )			1
many of the other young women at the event wore tiny shorts while the drinking appeared to have taken its toll on some party - goers others called it a night and poured into take - away shops for food a young woman gives her friend a piggy - back during the event in @entity21 as the agony aunt @entity229 said recently , a woman when drunk puts herself at more risk of rape and sexual assaults			1
she was pilloried for stating the obvious			0
but if you get drunk with the boys , you are incapable of self - defence			0
what chance would that @entity21 lass in our main picture lying drunk in the street have of fending off a man ? would she even remember what happened in the morning ? for educated , career women of my generation , it is unfathomable that those who follow the path we cleared to equality should choose to squander the great privileges they now have			0
women outnumber and outperform men at even our top universities			0
they have the best chance of fulfilling their dreams of any generation			0
yet i do n’t know a single boss who would now employ a graduate without first checking their @entity189 and social media accounts			0
perhaps these young women might give a thought to their future before so recklessly throwing it away on a moment of drunken madness .			0
