@entity0 suffered third - degree burns after a mattress designed to keep patients warm during surgery overheated as a health - and - safety inspector , @entity0 has a keen eye for detail and an appreciation for proper procedure			1
but he had no reason to suspect anything untoward when he arrived at hospital for routine keyhole surgery two years ago			2
' i was n't unduly nervous - i 'd been told it was just a minor procedure , ' says @entity0 , 58			1
however , when he came round from the op - to remove a benign cyst from his kidney - at @entity19 , @entity0 quickly realised something had gone very wrong during the two hours he was unconscious			1
' i immediately noticed a burning pain in my backside			0
as the anaesthetic wore off the pain got worse			0
i reached under my hospital gown and could feel blistering and flesh came away in my hand			0
it felt like my bottom was on fire			0
' @entity0 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , had suffered third - degree burns on his right hip and buttock , caused when a mattress designed to keep patients warm during surgery had overheated			1
such devices are commonly used to maintain patients ' core body temperature during surgery			1
a general anaesthetic reduces the body 's ability to control its temperature - and if the patient gets too cold , it could affect blood 's ability to clot , increasing the risk of bleeding			2
the quipment used in @entity0 's surgery works in a similar way to an electric blanket			1
but what appears to have happened in @entity0 's case is that a heat sensor which should have monitored his temperature during the operation was placed on a cold saline bag rather than his body			1
' because it registered such a low temperature , the mattress kept heating to the point where it could cook flesh , ' he explains			2
the next 24 hours were a terrifying blur			0
' that period is very tough for me to think about			0
' the staff first noticed the injury when i complained of pain in the recovery room			0
then all hell seemed to break loose with people rushing to look at my backside			0
' but all i remember is being given is a bit of ice for the burn and some painkillers			0
nothing made much difference to the terrible pain			0
' it was only the next day that i was visited by a burns nurse			2
' a mattress designed to keep patients warm during surgery overheated leaving mr @entity90 with a painful burn ( pictured left )			1
even two years later ( pictured right ) the burn is so painful mr @entity90 has had to give up sailing the following day he was admitted to a specialist burns hospital , where doctors said that the burnt area - around 8in by 6in ( 20cm by 15cm ) - was of full thickness , meaning all three layers of skin were damaged			1
@entity0 was there for a week , undergoing procedures to remove dead tissue and have an emergency skin graft			1
but during the skin graft he suffered a heart attack , thought to be down to a combination of three anaesthetics in quick succession , as well as the trauma he 'd endured			1
after @entity0 's injury , in september 2012 , the incident was investigated by the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) - where , by coincidence , @entity0 is head of operations for the @entity120			1
the @entity116 found the staff did not have sufficient training or information to ensure the mattress had been used correctly			2
last month , @entity19 and @entity125 pleaded guilty to a breach of the @entity127 - it is yet to be fined			2
during the court case it emerged that two other patients had received minor burns in similar circumstances , months before @entity0 's ordeal			1
' if the trust had learnt from these , they could have prevented what happened to me , ' says @entity0 , who has launched his own legal action against the trust			1
mistakes in the use of medical devices - which cover a broad spectrum , from high - tech scanners to sticking plasters - cause much needless pain			2
latest figures show that in 2013 there were 448 incidents relating to poor use of medical devices reported to the @entity154			0
@entity0 's was an extreme case although not a one - off , with seven severe burns from warming devices reported since january 2012			1
mr @entity0 underwent procedures to remove dead tissue and had to have an emergency skin graft			1
the injury site is pictured three weeks after the grafting other injuries caused by high - tech equipment include minor burns in @entity167 scanners			1
staff are meant to ensure patients are not wearing any metal but in these cases , they were wearing nicotine patches , which can contain traces of aluminium			2
and a patient was injured by an ultrasound probe after staff sterilised it too many times - after a certain number of cleans , the device should have been replaced			2
a major problem is training , says @entity185 , chief executive of the charity @entity186			0
' technology is constantly advancing and has a valuable and usually positive role to play			0
but it does mean more risks are introduced , so the system has to be able to deal with that risk			0
the problems can be avoided with proper training			0
' in @entity0 's case , the court heard that staff had failed to read the manual that came with the device , which was introduced to the trust in 2011			1
mr @entity185 says another issue is that there is inconsistency across the @entity204 when it comes to makes and models of medical devices used			0
' it makes it harder for staff to be familiar with how exactly how each device works , ' he says			0
two years since his injury , @entity0 's life has changed dramatically			1
after the operation , he was unable to work for five months			0
he is now back at work full time , but has to work two days a week from home and because sitting for long periods is uncomfortable , often has to stand in meetings			0
@entity0 , a qualified sailing instructor , also had to give up his hobby of racing dinghies because crouching in boats is too painful			1
the law firm representing him , @entity223 , says his case is ' extremely worrying '			0
' if this had been a much more vulnerable patient , we could have been looking at a significantly different case , ' solicitor @entity226 said			0
a spokeswoman for @entity19 and @entity125 has confirmed that the type of device used on @entity0 is no longer used by the trust following the incident , but could not comment further while the case was still active .			2
