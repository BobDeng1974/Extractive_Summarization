by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:05 est , 28 february 2014 menace : @entity4 attacked numerous women between 2002 and 2008 as @entity7 's bungled investigation failed to track him down more than 100 victims of ' black cab rapist ' @entity4 could sue @entity7 over its botched investigation into the menace after two women won a landmark case			1
the anonymous victims , attacked in 2003 and 2007 , successfully claimed their human rights had been breached by the @entity16 for failing to catch @entity4 during his six year rampage across @entity18			1
@entity4 , a former porn actor and stripper , attacked numerous women during a five - year period between 2002 and 2008			1
the 53 - year - old offered the women cheap lifts home after nights out but spiked their drinks before carrying out the assaults			2
police also found a ' rape kit ' in the back of his taxi which including sleeping tablets , condoms and gloves			0
@entity4 , who called himself @entity35 , was jailed indefinitely in april 2009 with a minimum tariff of eight years			1
but today , the two women - referred to as @entity37 and @entity38 - were awarded a @entity40 order for compensation from the @entity16 under @entity42 of the @entity43 , which relates to inhuman treatment			1
mr @entity45 at @entity18 ’s @entity40 ruled that the @entity16 was liable to hundreds of women for failures in its investigation and poor treatment of victims			1
@entity37 told the court she suffered from depression as a result of her treatment by officers during the 2003 investigation			2
@entity38 claimed that she suffered serious distress , anxiety , guilt and an exacerbation of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after her experience of the investigation in 2007			2
speaking on behalf of other victims , they accused the @entity16 of allowing @entity4 to run free and reoffend for an unacceptable amount of time			1
mr @entity45 said : ' in this case i have identified a series of systemic failings which went to the heart of the failure of the police to apprehend @entity4 and cut short his five - to six - year spree of violent attacks			1
' he berated senior officers for failing to train relevant officers in the intricacies of drug - facilitated sexual assaults and failing to supervise junior detectives			1
he also attacked detectives for not making use of intelligence sources to find links between the cases			0
other failures included losing the confidence of victims and not creating an environment where victims felt comfortable to express their ordeals			0
landmark ruling : the @entity40 ruled in favour of the women who will now receive compensation and pave the way for more than 100 more victims to make claims the judge said @entity4 was clinical and conniving and the effect upon the women was profound			1
' in the cases of @entity37 and @entity38 , i received evidence about the trauma they experienced at the time and subsequently , and have read the psychiatric reports upon them , ' he said			0
' i have learned that the effects of the assaults have stayed with them in a variety of ways over the ensuing years , manifesting themselves in depression , feelings of guilt , anxiety , and an inability to sustain relationships , including sexual relationships			0
' that trauma has to be multiplied one hundred fold , and more , to begin to have a sense of the pain and suffering that @entity4 ’ serial predatory behaviour exerted upon his many victims			2
' but their feelings are not the end of this circle of misery because , as was evident from the psychiatric and other evidence , the effects rippled throughout the victims ’ families and their respective circles of friends			0
' he said the @entity16 was liable to both women for breach of the @entity43 in relation to the period between 2003 - which coincided with the first complaint to police - and 2009 , when @entity4 was tried			1
attacks : this is an image , released by @entity16 , of the taxi he used to drug and attack the women in a statement , the @entity16 said : ' the @entity16 has previously apologised for mistakes made in the investigation of rapes committed by @entity4			1
' the judge acknowledged that the failings in this case were very much historic ; a recognition that in the interim we have made important and significant changes to the way we investigate rape , which remains one of the most challenging and complex policing issues			0
we are committed to providing the best possible service to victims , ensuring that they are at the heart of every investigation			2
' we will now take time to consider the judgment in full			0
' @entity37 said later : ' after 11 years of living with guilt , i can now finally start to put it all behind me and move on with my life			0
i have always felt responsible for what happened to @entity4 ’ other victims but i now know this was not my fault			2
' what i am now responsible for , and am extremely proud of , is making the @entity16 finally accept they have a duty towards victims			0
' @entity38 added : ' the experience of being disbelieved by the police was almost worse than the rape itself			0
it ’s been unbearably hard to bring this case and spend years going over the same events			0
' i am so relieved that our efforts have finally resulted in justice			0

@entity40 ruled victims had been severely *damaged* by their treatment
mr @entity45 berated detectives for failing to make victims feel at ease
and ' bungled investigation let @entity4 run free for unacceptable period '
@entity4 , jailed for life in 2009 , raped 100 women between 2002 and 2007
