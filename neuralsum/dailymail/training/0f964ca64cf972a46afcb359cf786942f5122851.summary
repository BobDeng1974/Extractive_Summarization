published : 21:05 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 19 january 2013 snowfall has caused the closure of many schools and if the poor weather continues , they will remain shut next week			1
but why do we educate our children in schools ? i think we have lost sight of their purpose , and the cold snap gives us a chance to think afresh			1
while at home , the children can catch up on the news on @entity17 and his depravities , cyclist @entity19 , who deceived the world with his drug - taking , and @entity22 , the good - time girl who last week married a man on the advice of a psychic			1
these and other ‘ characters ’ like them exert huge influence on the nation			1
in truth , they are just paper - thin personalities			1
the rot set in with the publication of @entity39 ’s @entity35 in 1936 , which put superficial personality skills above deeper virtues			1
it opened the cult of the personality , where people are judged not by who they are but how they present themselves			1
helping pupils flourish : master of @entity48 @entity47 we can trace good character traits back to the @entity52 philosopher , @entity51 , who argued that society will flourish only when we develop the virtues of our young			1
traditional values include courage , resilience , loyalty , honesty , kindness , respect , responsibility and self - control			1
to these we might add everyday qualities : politeness , punctuality , good manners			1
studies show that these can be taught , and that they endure throughout life			2
families have a role to play , but so do schools			1
last year , the @entity73 founded the @entity74 to study the development of good character			2
the research shows conclusively that good character traits are better predictors of academic and economic success and happiness than raw iq			2
in the @entity84 , a branch of schools called @entity85 ( @entity85 ) focus on developing character , with high success rates			1
each child is given a ‘ character report card ’ , designed to show their traits improving over time			2
developing character requires teachers to emphasise positive virtues , and to model them			2
self - control is learnt through exercises that reward endurance , such as long hikes			2
assemblies must highlight good behaviour and students should be trusted and taught to distinguish right from wrong			2
older pupils should be given real responsibilities			2
kindness must be emphasised , and all students given chances to volunteer and serve others			2
' characters ' like @entity22 exert a huge influence on the nation but the government cares only for improving academic standards , measured by the passing of exams			0
do n’t get me wrong , high standards are fundamental , and education secretary @entity115 and chief inspector sir @entity116 are changing the landscape of @entity119 schooling			0
but their vision is sadly incomplete			0
the obsession with exams has caused schools to narrow what they offer , because teachers know they are being judged on academic results alone			1
the government wants a ‘ @entity129 ’ and strong communities			0
they have initiated a ‘ decade of social action ’ , and the @entity132 , a voluntary programme for 16 - year - olds			0
all excellent , but too little			0
just this week , we have heard that parents are raising children ‘ in captivity ’ because of paranoia about safety : rather than facing character - forming challenges , they are mollycoddled			0
meanwhile , @entity144 suggests changes to current drugs laws			0
as a headmaster who has seen pupils die from drugs , we need to do far more to help our young have the character to say ‘ no ’			0
we can not leave it to families			0
does the government really think employers and universities want people who can pass tests , but lack the ability to think creatively , or the discipline to contribute ? protest about the lack of character in school leavers is rising to a cacophony			0
at my own school , @entity48 , our young must abide by five values which they themselves chose : courage , integrity , kindness , responsibility and respect			1
they are taught self - control and endurance ; working in teams on the games field and in the cadet force , learning to overcome their limitations and obey instructions			0
since we started teaching well - being five years ago , where pupils learn to develop resilience , exam performance has rocketed – from 65 per cent a and b grades at a-level to 93 per cent			0
listen mr @entity115 ! the government 's obsession with exam results is damaging young people for life but it is not just independent schools			1
from @entity192 in @entity193 to the @entity194 in @entity195 , the best state schools are concentrating on character , with startling success			1
@entity199 in @entity200 , which has a strong uniform code , celebrates good manners , and teaches each child to aspire , has been transformed in just a few years			0
governments want to show that they have significantly bolstered results and league table performance			0
but society has a longer time - frame , and needs young people to become kind , law - abiding , creative citizens			0
on wednesday , i am giving a lecture at the @entity74 on the neglect of character education in our schools , and how this is selling society short			1
the government is damaging young people for life because of its obsession with exam results – and making a mockery of its claim to be building a @entity129			0
listen , please , mr @entity115 !			0

we have lost sight of the purpose of schools , says master of @entity48 @entity47
