@entity1 's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a £ 1million @entity5 masterpiece that was looted by the @entity6 from its @entity8 owner during the @entity9			1
@entity1 chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting – beaching a boat , @entity15 – was legitimately brought to @entity1			1
the 1946 document bears the signature of a dealer called @entity20 and seeks permission for the transfer of artworks from @entity24 to @entity25 , including one by @entity5 identified as @entity26			0
the descendants of @entity46 – believed to be two daughters and a grandchild – say the @entity6 stole the painting and smuggled it out of @entity50			0
it turned up in @entity1 in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the @entity41 in 1986			2
the family launched a claim three years ago			0
the government - backed @entity55 , which rules on disputes over looted art , supported the heirs last year and said the @entity41 had a ‘ moral obligation ’ to return the painting			2
sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the @entity41 ’s claim that @entity43 voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive			1
the @entity41 does not dispute that the painting was looted by the @entity6 but the gallery ’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported			1
stormy seas : the battle over @entity5 's painting evokes the story of a @entity8 refugee 's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film woman in @entity78 ( pictured ) gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in @entity50 after the war			1
but @entity83 understands the claimants will argue the permit does n’t change anything as it does not identify @entity43			0
one source said : ‘ if you had stolen the painting , you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country			1
’ a source at the @entity41 explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by the @entity97 public , which is why the gallery argued that the painting should remain in the @entity97			2
they said : ‘ no one disputes that the picture was at one stage looted by the @entity6 , what is in dispute is what happened after it was returned to its owner			0
’ the dispute evokes the story of @entity111 ’s new film , woman in @entity78 , which charts the story of how @entity8 refugee @entity114 battled for almost a decade with the @entity116 government to reclaim @entity118 ’s iconic picture of her aunt called @entity121 i.			0

' beaching a boat , @entity15 ' taken from @entity8 owner in @entity9
