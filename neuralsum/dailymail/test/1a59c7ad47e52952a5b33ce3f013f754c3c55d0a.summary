@entity1 's attempt to impress the @entity3 selectors ended in failure in @entity5 on sunday afternoon			0
in the same @entity9 arena where @entity1 hopes to be batting against @entity10 in the first @entity11 this summer , the @entity7 batsman fell for 19 after appearing to be ready to build on the 170 he made against the @entity14 students last week			1
@entity1 was making his first @entity16 appearance since june 2013 in the hope of finding a way back into the @entity3 set - up			2
@entity1 trudges off the pitch after being dismissed for 19 on his championship return @entity1 edges behind off the bowling of @entity23 having already survived a scare the former @entity3 star 's expression tells the story as he sees the ball held at first slip the 34 - year - old came to the wicket just after lunch with @entity7 well placed on 111 for two and he was soon into his stride with two boundaries - one through the legside and the other a fine cover drive - in the same @entity37 over			1
@entity1 was fortunate to escape with a mistimed hook off @entity40 , which just beat the fine - leg fielder , but he picked up the fourth boundary of his innings when he drove the ball over the head of left - arm spinner @entity46			0
however , his 28 - ball stay ended when he pushed hard at @entity23 's medium pace and edged to @entity50 at first slip with @entity7 reduced to 150 for three			2
@entity23 celebrates removing the @entity7 batsman , but the @entity53 bowlers were made to toil @entity1 had to watch on as his team - mates piled on the runs , with @entity7 reaching 363/3 on day one @entity1 , who is hoping for an @entity3 return , had looked in good form before edging behind @entity60 star @entity59 , making his @entity7 debut , outshone @entity1 , scoring a century as the visitors piled on the runs on the first day			1
the 37 - year - old put together a huge partnership of over 200 with former @entity3 one - day wicketkeeper @entity64 - who also reached three figures - after @entity1 's departure			0
@entity60 @entity67 made a hundred on @entity7 debut batting at @entity70			0
