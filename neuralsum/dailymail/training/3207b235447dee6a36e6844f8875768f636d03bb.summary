by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 2 october 2013 help : @entity2 chief inspector sir @entity1 said private schools should be supporting those in the state sector independent schools are offering nothing more than the ‘ crumbs from their tables ’ to state schools they should be supporting , the head of @entity2 said yesterday			1
sir @entity1 said private schools should be supporting those in the state sector			1
but many give the impression they only do their duty ‘ when push comes to shove ’ , he said			0
many offer little more than coaching for a-level students or the use of playing fields , he claimed - providing ‘ ammunition ’ for critics who think strict quotas should be introduced to give more university places to state school pupils			1
the chief inspector of schools quoted @entity32 figures that only three per cent of members - 34 schools - were sponsoring or co-sponsoring an academy school and five per cent were loaning teaching staff			1
in his speech to leading independent headteachers at a conference in @entity40 , he reminded them many of their schools had been founded with a mission to help underprivileged children			2
describing it as his ‘ @entity48 moment ’ , he said : ‘ your country needs you			0
’ he added : ‘ the @entity32 ’s list of activities is hardly evidence of a comprehensive commitment to partnership with state schools			2
‘ it ’s thin stuff			0
these are crumbs off your tables , leading more to famine than feast			2
’ sir @entity1 said if the private sector treated the state as a ‘ rival ’ they should ‘ not be surprised if it returns the sentiment ’			1
‘ it would be a moral retreat and a tactical mistake to confuse independence with isolation - haughty detachment can become a very tempting target , ’ he added			0
schools that ‘ choose to remain aloof ... only give ammunition to those who would like to put even stricter quotas on independent pupils ’ access to our top , publicly - funded universities ’			2
universities charging fees above £ 6,000 now have to prepare ‘ access agreements ’ to show how they are widening access to include more teenagers from deprived backgrounds			0
maintained schools have shown significant improvements in recent years , sir @entity1 said			1
against : @entity92 , headmaster of @entity93 in @entity94 ( pictured ) complained primaries and secondaries in his area ¿ politically object ¿ to private schools and had refused assistance but he highlighted two main areas of concern - ‘ huge ’ regional variations in schools ’ quality and underachievement among the poorest children ’			1
he added : ‘ heads in inner city @entity40 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 have n’t got the time to worry whether their children are climbing trees proficiently			0
‘ these heads know that gaining academic qualifications is the one route out of poverty and disadvantage			0
’ the comments received a mixed reception at the @entity121 ’ and @entity122 ’ conference annual meeting , with some in the audience angrily rejecting the accusation they were doing too little			0
@entity93 headmaster @entity92 complained primaries and secondaries in his area ‘ politically object ’ to private schools and had refused assistance			2
another delegate complained to sir @entity1 that schools which offer help other than sponsoring academies ‘ fail your test ’			1
@entity32 general secretary @entity137 said sir @entity1 ’s comments showed a ‘ lack of understanding ’ at the work independent schools do in the state sector			1
‘ rather than focus on one prescriptive form of support clearly favoured by @entity149 chief inspector , our schools use their independence to deliver tailored programmes in local partnerships , ’ he added			0
‘ our most recent census disclosed that over 90 per cent of our schools are already involved in genuine and meaningful collaborative work with their state sector colleagues			0
’ sir @entity1 praised some schools including @entity158 , which has co-sponsored the @entity159 , a sixth form college in @entity161 , and @entity162 , which has established a partnership with @entity164 in @entity165 .			1
