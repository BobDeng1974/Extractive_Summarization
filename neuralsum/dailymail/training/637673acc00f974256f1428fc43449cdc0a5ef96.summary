saying you love your friend 's new shoes can strengthen your bond lying to your loved ones may seem like a sure fire way to push them away			2
but new research says telling white lies - specifically for the right reasons - can actually strengthen social bonds			1
fibbing about how good your friend looks in a ( bad ) dress or how much you love your partner 's ( awful ) new haircut tends to be good for relationships			2
but lying to cover up a misdeed or just to get your way is not the way to improve your relationships , says @entity20 , evolutionary psychologist at @entity21			1
this type of deception , known as antisocial lying , is destructive and weakens bonds between two people			2
on the other hand , lies told to help another person or to protect someone 's feelings tend to be good for relationships , @entity20 said			1
psychologists call this pro-social lying , but it 's more commonly known as telling a white lie or a fib			1
to study how these two types of lies affect relationships within social groups , @entity20 and a team of researchers associated with the @entity43 , in @entity44 , created a complex mathematical model , report @entity47			1
the model showed that those who tell anti-social lies become slowly isolated from others within their social networks			2
however , people who tell pro-social lies do n't become isolated from their groups			2
in fact , they tend to form stronger links with others in their social networks			0
while the researchers created a purely hypothetical model , @entity20 said it could be used to understand how lying affects groups of friends and peers in the real world			1
fibbing about how much you love your partner 's ( awful ) new haircut tends to be good for relationships researchers speculated that the model could also help psychologists better understand the effects of lying in online communities , where much of today 's social networking takes place			1
social networks that people create online - on sites such as @entity80 and @entity81 - mimic the social networks they 're part of in the real world			0
so , fibbing on @entity80 , much like telling a white lie to a friend over lunch , might actually improve your relationships , according to the new model			1
@entity91 , a psychology professor at @entity92 , @entity93 , told @entity47 he finds the @entity95 button most fascinating			0
he said that in general , people like things on @entity80 because of something he calls ' virtual empathy			0
' whether you 're liking a picture of your aunt 's cat or a status update from a childhood friend , pressing the like button tells a person that you have good intentions or that you support them in some way , @entity91 said			0
the like button can function as a type of lie however , not all likes are delivered with such good intentions			1
sometimes people might click the like button just because they feel it 's something they 're supposed to do			0
for these people , pressing the like button functions as a type of lie			0
' i think that in many cases you can consider the like a white lie if [ it 's done ] for reasons that have nothing to do with support , ' he said			1
liking something on @entity80 that you do n't actually like resembles giving a dishonest answer to a question such as ' do you like my new shoes ? '			0
in these situations , you might say something insincere , but only because you 're worried that honesty might hurt someone 's feelings			0
and while it can calm your nerves to lie , it could also save your friendship .			0

lying to cover up a misdeed or just get your way can harm relationships
lies told to help someone or protect their feelings tend to be good
*facebook* likes are a bit like a white lie and are just as good for relationships
