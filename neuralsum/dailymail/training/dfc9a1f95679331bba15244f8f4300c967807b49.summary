his charge against the television industry follows a two - year period in which a number of former @entity34 stars have been accused of serious sexual offences and the @entity36 has come under fierce criticism for its failure to curb the criminal excesses of some of its heavily - promoted celebrities			1
@entity43 , once a children ’s tv presenter highly - prized by the @entity34 , has been exposed since his death in 2011 as one of the country ’s most prolific paedophiles			1

the archbishop told @entity57 : ‘ the biggest issue for us is the legacy of vast abuse in the days when in , if i may say so , also , television and all kinds of areas , it was considered relatively acceptable			1
‘ we , you know , so - and - so was known to be a bit dodgy , but nobody made too much fuss			0
‘ we ’ve gone through every file , back file of every living clergy person in the @entity13 and looked for any signs that there was a problem and followed them up where there was			1
’ archbishop @entity0 spoke to @entity77 in the wake of a damaging report on abuse in the @entity13 and the humiliation of one of its most senior clergy , former archbishop of york @entity85			1

@entity105 , who rose to become @entity109 , in charge of the city ’s cathedral , was a lifelong paedophile who had attracted complaints in every decade from the 1950s			2
it suggested the suicide in 1989 of a former @entity117 choirboy may have been connected to abuse by @entity105 in the 1970s , and it said a complaint laid against @entity105 by @entity120 ’s organist in 1989 was ignored			2

he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 but @entity85 deflected queries about @entity105 , wrongly told other bishops that @entity105 was too sick to carry out any further abuse , and allowed him to continue taking services and befriending choristers at @entity127			2
