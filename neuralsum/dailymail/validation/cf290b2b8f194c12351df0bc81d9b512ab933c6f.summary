@entity1 striker @entity0 has vowed to prove @entity3 's under 19s do n't need @entity6 superkid @entity4 by firing @entity8 's youngsters to a winning start in their @entity10 against hosts @entity11 on thursday			1
@entity8 's decision to omit the promising @entity15 talent for the tournament has caused uproar , mixed with bemusement , after the former @entity21 boss ' comments about @entity4 not being physically strong enough			1
@entity4 's replacement does not have @entity23 as a coach or the luxury of a five - year deal with @entity6			1
in fact , @entity0 is currently on loan from @entity29 at @entity30 mid-table outfit @entity1			1
on loan @entity32 striker is ready to step up for @entity3 under 19s against @entity11 on thursday @entity0 in action for @entity3 under 19s against @entity36 during an @entity38 match however , the 18 - year - old is in agreement with @entity8 that @entity3 need to be physical in their three games which starts on thursday in @entity42 against hosts @entity11 , before facing @entity44 on saturday and @entity45 next week			1
and he 's had plenty of practice playing for @entity1 against the likes of @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity53 's grizzled defenders			2
@entity0 said : ' obviously , @entity4 has n't made the squad , but it 's good to know it ' s not just about reputations			1
if they do come and watch you and you do well then you get the rewards for that			0
' the boys are confident and we know we have quality in this team and an ability to hurt the opposition			0
if we stick to the game - plan and play how we know we can play we 've got a chance			1
it 's tough against the hosts , @entity44 and @entity45 for that matter but we want to test ourselves against the best			2
' they 're all good sides and hopefully we can go out there and prove a point			0
they 're going to be big and powerful sides but we see ourselves in that bracket as well			0
hopefully we can cope with that and let our football do the talking			0
@entity6 youngster @entity4 has been left out of the latest @entity3 under 19 squad @entity0 says that he has had to toughen up playing against conference opposition ' you have to grow up fast and it 's very different to @entity29 , although @entity1 like to try and play a bit to be fair			1
in the @entity30 it 's tough to play football on some of the pitches against some of the teams			1
it 's a great learning experience and just adds to my game			2
the defenders have definitely tried to rough me up			0
' the worst was at @entity96 away			0
both of their centre - backs were about 6ft 6in and i was playing up front on my own			2
but we got through and won , so i enjoy testing myself against bigger and stronger players			0
it 's a different experience			2
' but the @entity4 issue does bring back memories of a depressingly frank admission from @entity109 , then @entity3 under - 21 boss , in june 2009			1
a month earlier , @entity110 and @entity111 had passed @entity112 to death during the 2009 @entity114 at @entity116 's @entity115			2
recalling a community coaching forum at @entity118 24 hours before , @entity109 said : ' i was asked whether @entity111 and @entity110 would have flourished and come through the @entity120 system			0
' it 's hard to say because you 're looking at two different cultures but the answer is - probably not			1
the @entity125 place an emphasis on sheer technique and movement			0
our game is based more on power and pace			0
so there 's an argument that they would n't have come through in this country to become the players they are now			2
@entity3 under 19s manager @entity8 claimed @entity4 is not big enough physically @entity4 is currently midway through a five - year deal with @entity6 and is tipped to have a big future ' but the @entity125 approach is working for them and it deserves to be copied , ' he added			1
former @entity3 manager @entity143 has urged caution in the rush to condemn the under - fire sbragia			1
' i 've the greatest of admiration for @entity150 as a man and a coach , ' said the 74 - year - old			2
' my friend @entity154 speaks highly of him and he 's also worked under sir @entity156 at @entity112			2
so i 'd like to hear more on the context of the words spoken by him ( about @entity4 )			1
' but i would say this : people are saying this young lad is a @entity6 player			1
he 's not ; he 's never played for @entity6			1
i was a @entity164 signing but i never played for @entity164			0
' @entity6 will have hundreds of kids in their system			1
i 'm not for a minute saying @entity4 is not a good player			1
i have n't seen him so i do n't know			0
former @entity3 boss @entity143 ( second right ) revealed his admiration for under 19 coach @entity8 ' but i think people get hypnotised by the name @entity6			1
there 's a frenzy going on but if ( the same player ) played for another club would there be the same impact ? ' @entity143 admitted it is an occupational hazard of a national youth selector to end up looking foolish			2
' you ca n't get every player right , ' he said			0
' here 's my example : when i was @entity3 under 21 manager , i got a phone call from the late @entity186 , manager of @entity187 , saying he had a good player for me			1
it was @entity190 , and he was good , but i did n't think he was as good as @entity191 and @entity192			0
' i told @entity156 the only reason i would be picking @entity190 would be solely to prevent @entity194 getting him – and that would be unfair			0
he would have been a bench player for @entity3			2
' so the @entity196 picked him instead and our next game was against @entity194 at @entity199			0
my over-age centre half that day was @entity201 and @entity190 knocked the ball past @entity156 and stuck it in the roof of his net			0
' i remember thinking ' i 've messed up here '			0
but we ended up winning 4 - 1 and i think @entity192 scored three			0
but you can get egg on your face … '			0
