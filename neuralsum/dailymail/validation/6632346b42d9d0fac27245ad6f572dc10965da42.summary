two - time all - pro running back @entity6 will be traded to the @entity7 in exchange for third - year linebacker @entity9			1
the stunning trade will reunite @entity3 head coach @entity0 with former @entity11 star @entity9 , who is coming off acl surgery after a dominant rookie year in 2013			2
@entity6 will move to @entity14 to work under new head coach @entity16 @entity9 will be reunited with @entity0 as he looks to recover from acl surgery @entity6 was regularly sidelined in favour of @entity19 during the @entity3 ' disastrous stretch , which saw the @entity21 claim the @entity23 title			1
