workers on the £ 15billion @entity2 project have made their latest breakthrough after tunnelling under the @entity4 with a 1,000 tonne drill			2
the colossal machine , named @entity7 after the @entity8 , has broke into the eastern end of @entity2 station			1
the breakthrough - 40 metres below the financial district - symbolises light at the end of the tunnel for the project which is around 60 per cent complete			1
@entity7 now has 750m to bore to reach the end of the line as part of @entity2 's longest tunnelling drive of 8.3km from @entity20 , near @entity21 , to @entity22 and is expected to be finished in the spring			2
@entity2 is one of 10 new @entity2 stations being built in central and south - east @entity37 workmen wait for the tunnel machine to appear through the far end of the tunnel deep beneath @entity37 's banking district @entity43 , @entity2 's chief executive , said : ' we are now on the final countdown to the big east / west breakthrough at @entity22 , which will link all of @entity2 's tunnels for the first time			1
' this is a phenomenal feat of civil engineering that @entity37 can be justifiably proud of			0
the next challenge is to implement railway systems across the route , keeping the project on time and within budget			0
' upon the breakthrough , a worker poked his head through the narrow gap and waved to colleagues in celebration			0
so far more than 60 per cent of the overall work has been completed for the project which will see , by 2018 , high - speed trains running from as far west as @entity67 in @entity68 , through central @entity37 to @entity69 in south @entity37 and as far east as @entity70 in @entity71			1
a sister machine , named @entity73 , will reach @entity22 several weeks after @entity7			2
last week it was reported that @entity2 was facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when the line 's due to open in 2018 - and engineers admitted the complex signal issues may not be resolved in the next three years			2
a source inside the project claimed it was still likely that @entity2 would open , with reduced services , but suggested said it was also possible that no trains would be running at all in 2018			2
so far more than 60 per cent of the overall work has been completed for the project which will see , by 2018 , high - speed trains running from as far west as @entity67 in @entity68 , through central @entity37 to @entity69 in south @entity37 and as far east as @entity70 in @entity71 more than 10,000 people are currently working on the project , including 400 apprentices , with the project at peak rate of @entity92 machines @entity7 and @entity73 each weigh 1,000 tonnes , are 150 metres long and more than seven metres in diameter the walls slowly begins to crumble as the gigantic drill bores through			1
@entity2 , @entity97 's biggest construction project , is initially scheduled to run 24 trains per hour during peak periods , and it is hoped this will increase to 30 @entity7 and @entity73 each weigh 1,000 tonnes , are 150m long and over seven metres in diameter			1
they are the last of eight @entity2 tunnel machines to have carved a route beneath @entity37 linking the @entity105 , the @entity4 , @entity106 and southeast @entity37 @entity107 adopts both traditional metro signalling and modern high - tech systems to connect trains on the 26 miles of new tracks underneath @entity37 to existing major cross-country rail lines			1
as it stands , engineers are struggling to create ' interfaces ' - meaning the trains are unable to shift smoothly from the orthodox metro system to the @entity117 used once outside central @entity37			1
@entity2 's chairman , @entity119 , conceded that a ' mitigation plan ' was being put in place , @entity118 reported			0
by the end of may this year rail services between @entity2 and @entity70 will join the @entity125 transport network			2
this will be the first phase of the introduction of @entity2 , which will be fully integrated with @entity125 services			0
@entity131 @entity130 is constructing the eastern tunnels between @entity133 and @entity134 , @entity20 and @entity22 , and @entity135 and @entity136			0
the station tunnels at @entity2 have been built by a joint venture comprising @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
the @entity2 route will pass through 40 stations and run more than 100km from @entity67 and @entity145 in the west , through new twin - bore 21km ( 13 - mile ) tunnels below central @entity37 to @entity70 and @entity69 in the east a worker emerges from behind the drill - watched from the other side by colleagues			1
the first @entity107 services through central @entity37 will start in late 2018 - an estimated 200 million annual passengers will use the new scheme upon the breakthrough , a worker poked his head through the narrow gap and waved to colleagues in celebration on completion of the project , some 4.5 million tonnes of excavated material from the tunnels will be shipped to @entity165 in @entity71 where it will be used to create a new 1,500 acre @entity168 nature reserve the @entity2 route will pass through 40 stations and run more than 100km from @entity67 and @entity145 in the west , through new twin - bore 21km ( 13 - mile ) tunnels below central @entity37 to @entity70 and @entity69 in the east			1

some 4.5 million tonnes of excavated material from the tunnels will be shipped to @entity165 in @entity71 where it will be used to create a new 1,500 acre @entity168 nature reserve .			0
