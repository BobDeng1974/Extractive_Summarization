@entity0 is thought to have sold more than one million of its smartwatches in the first 24 hours it was available for pre-order			2
but @entity5 buyers who are prepared to wait to get their hands on the eagerly anticipated wearable may want to snap up an @entity0 watch on holiday , because @entity5 is the most expensive place in the world to buy one			2
the most expensive edition model costs up to £ 2,500 more in the @entity5 compared to elsewhere in the world , while at the lower end of the scale @entity5 buyers pay up to £ 63 more for the @entity19 model			1
@entity5 is the most expensive place in the world in buy the @entity8			0
the three models are pictured above			0
the @entity19 , shown left is round £ 63 more expensive in the @entity5 than the @entity23 and there is a difference in price of over £ 1,230 when it comes to the luxurious @entity28 ( right ) the gadget is available to pre-order in nine countries			1
the cheapest model is the 38mm sport version and costs £ 299 in the @entity5			1
in the @entity23 , the same model costs $ 349 , but this does n't include sales tax			1
sales tax in the @entity23 depends on the region where the product is sold , but as an example @entity40 has one of the highest rates - at 9 % - while @entity44 has zero			1
with both of these sales taxes added to the price of the sports model in the @entity23 , the total cost works out at $ 380.41 ( £ 257 ) and $ 349 ( £ 236 ) in the respective states			1
this is a difference of £ 42 when bought in @entity40 , compared to the @entity5 , and £ 63 when compared to @entity44			1
the effect is magnified for the top - of - the - range edition version , which costs from £ 8,000 for the 38mm model in @entity5 , compared to a starting price of $ 10,000 in the @entity23			1
at the time of writing , $ 10,000 converts to £ 6,769 - which equates to a difference of £ 1,231 before charges are taken into account			0
the most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the @entity5 is £ 13,500 in the @entity5 , and $ 17,000 in the @entity23			1
when sales taxes are added to the @entity23 model , the price rises to $ 18,530 in @entity40 , which converts to £ 12,543 - a difference of £ 957			1
all prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region			0
prices also include all relevant sales taxes			2
beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in @entity76			0
in the @entity23 , @entity40 was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9 % , while @entity44 was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it does n't have a sales tax			1
@entity82 in @entity83 has one of the highest sales taxes at 15 % , while @entity85 has one of the lowest at 5 %			0
prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing			0
but the difference is n't just visible between the @entity5 and @entity23			2
in @entity94 , for example , the most expensive 38mm edition costs $ 21,000 aud , which converts to £ 10,832 - a difference of around £ 2,665 compared to the @entity5			1
in fact , during @entity102 investigations the @entity5 price for all three models of the watch , in both sizes with all sales taxes included , still works out more expensive in all the other regions where the watch is currently available for pre-order			0
the only places the watch works out cheaper in the @entity5 is when it 's compared to the most expensive @entity110 model in @entity94 and @entity111 , or the 38mm edition in @entity82 and @entity111			2
explaining the price differences , @entity0 told @entity102 : ' @entity5 prices include @entity115			1
@entity23 prices do n't include sales tax			1
' sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the tax rate , which varies widely by jurisdiction , and ranges from zero to around 15 per cent in @entity83			2
