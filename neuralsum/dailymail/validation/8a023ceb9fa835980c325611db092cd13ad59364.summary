eight - time grand slam champion @entity0 believes @entity3 men 's tennis has to ' regroup at grass roots level ' if it ever wants to boast a world number one again			1
the @entity3 take on @entity6 in the @entity7 in @entity8 this weekend , hoping to avenge last year 's 3 - 1 defeat in @entity10			1
world number five @entity12 will lead the charge for @entity6 and goes into the first - round @entity7 tie as the stand - out singles player , with @entity3 's @entity17 and @entity18 ranked only 20th and 47th respectively			1
@entity3 legend @entity0 ( pictured in 2009 ) says @entity3 must ' regroup ' its grass roots tennis set - up world number five @entity12 will lead the line for @entity6 at the @entity7 this coming weekend @entity3 's @entity18 stretches to return a shot to @entity23 during the @entity24 on february 22 @entity17 of the @entity3 plays a backhand during his third - round match at the @entity27 2015 it is a far cry from the days of @entity0 , who lifted the @entity7 in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 alongside the likes of seven - time @entity31 champion @entity30 and four - time major winner @entity32			1
the last time @entity3 produced a male grand slam winner was 2003 , when @entity0 won the @entity27 and @entity34 triumphed in @entity35			1
' being the next @entity34 or the next @entity0 will still leave you shy of winning tournaments these days			2
that 's the truth , ' @entity0 told @entity39			2
' will we ever have a number one player again ? that 's achievable , of course it is , but the four guys at the top now - @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity12 - they have redefined what this sport is all about over the last 10 years			1
' you need something unique these days to make inroads , especially growing up in a country that does n't have red clay courts			0
@entity3 tennis great @entity30 won the @entity31 championship seven times during his career @entity0 has singled out @entity61 's @entity48 as one of the ' four guys at the top now ' he has also placed @entity65 's @entity50 on that list , pictured here at the @entity67 @entity68 's @entity49 returns a ball against @entity71 @entity70 during the final of the @entity74 @entity73 ' i do n't know where @entity12 spent his childhood playing ( he spent time in @entity68 as a teenager ) but he plays the game like he was n't just playing indoors			1
' we do n't have that in @entity3			2
we have a lot of fast court players and the ones who do shine are the ones who bring a different equation			0
' @entity17 , for example , is a monster , he 's 6ft 10 plus with a huge game , so we have to regroup at a grass roots level			0
' despite a shock defeat to 18 - year - old @entity95 in @entity96 last week , @entity12 will be expected to win both his singles matches in @entity8			1
that means the tie could depend on the doubles rubber , where @entity12 and @entity101 are set to face @entity3 twins @entity103 and @entity104 , the most successful duo of all time			2
@entity3 duo @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 are set to come up against @entity6 's @entity101 and @entity12 ' it 's a tough ask for both teams because there 's very little that separates it , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have a big advantage in our doubles but you guys have a huge advantage with @entity12			0
' people think he 's coming off a bad loss but i 've got news for you ; he 's going to be ready to go in a week and he 's going to be playing his best tennis in front of a home crowd			2
' i hope we can get over the finishing line and i 'll have my fingers crossed like the rest of us			0
' @entity0 has previously admitted an interest in a coaching career and is even considered a potential mentor for @entity12 , who idolised the @entity3 as a junior			1
' i enjoy the idea of coaching but i would n't physically , emotionally and mentally be able to do the job that i would want to do , ' @entity0 said			0
' you ca n't just step in and give advice			0
coaching is n't talking , it 's learning			0
' the things i say about @entity12 are not going to be a surprise to him			0
' it 's finding out what that switch is , it 's getting them to see something a different way and you ca n't do that until you spend time and learn with them			0
' i ca n't commit the time now , even if i wanted to , i have too many responsibilities			0
' that does n't mean there would n't be a time in the future , but i ca n't do it at the moment			0
' @entity0 is tipping @entity12 to recover from his shock loss to @entity95 and perform well at the @entity7			1

@entity3 tennis legend @entity0 says the country needs to ' regroup '
he feels they are a long way off producing another world number one
@entity0 has backed @entity6 's @entity12 to *impress* at the @entity7
@entity12 enters the tournament off the back of a shock loss to @entity95
