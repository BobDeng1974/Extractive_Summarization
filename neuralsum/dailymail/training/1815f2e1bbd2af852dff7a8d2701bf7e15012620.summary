mr @entity58 - not his real name - was a commander in an @entity62 insurgent group crushed by the better armed and financed @entity8 as it seized almost full control of @entity23 earlier this year			1
the small band he now leads is in no position to deal a major blow to @entity8			0
but it does pose an extra challenge as the @entity41 and its allies target the group in air strikes in both @entity6 and @entity73			0
the @entity74 , which tracks the war , has recorded a rising number of attacks by gunmen on @entity8 targets in @entity23 province			1

@entity86 soldiers hold their position on a tank as they watch @entity89 from near the @entity91 border crossing @entity19 shows no mercy to @entity8 : when it manages to abduct one of its members , it is only to ‘ liquidate ’ him later on , said mr @entity95			2
it operates in and around the town of @entity97 at the @entity73 border , an area of crucial importance to @entity8 as the link between the territory it controls in @entity6 and @entity73			2
the group currently numbers 300 members , said mr @entity58			0
he added : ‘ eighty per cent of the members of @entity19 did not take part in combat before ( @entity8 ) came			2
we trained them and they joined @entity19 because of the great oppression they felt after @entity0 took control			0
’ the @entity74 says @entity19 is one of several small groups that have taken up arms against @entity8 in @entity23 in recent months and are picking off @entity8 fighters whenever they get the chance			1
they have all taken similarly menacing names			0
these include the ‘ @entity123 ’ and ‘ @entity124 of the @entity125 ’ , said @entity126 , who runs the @entity74 , which says it gathers information from sources on all sides of the conflict			0
smoke rises after a strike in @entity89 , @entity6 , while fighting continues between @entity135 and @entity8 militants one such group killed no fewer than 10 @entity8 fighters in a nighttime gun attack on a checkpoint in the town of @entity142 in @entity23 last thursday , the @entity74 reported			1
in a separate attack , a gunman on a motor bike opened fire on another @entity8 checkpoint			0
‘ there is an increase in their operations against @entity0 , ’ mr @entity126 said			0
@entity8 has made plenty of enemies during its conquest of @entity23 , an oil - producing region			2
it expelled most other insurgent groups from @entity23 in july , emboldened by rapid gains in @entity73 where it seized the city of @entity160 in june , capturing with it @entity73 army equipment that has been deployed in @entity6			1
mirroring its approach elsewhere , @entity8 has used crucifixions and decapitations to suppress all opposition in @entity23			2
it executed 700 members of one rebellious tribe , the @entity168 , in august , the @entity74 reported			0
members of @entity62 armed groups loosely referred to as the ‘ @entity174 ’ had the choice of fleeing , submitting to @entity8 rule , or death			0
the @entity86 military and the fled residents of @entity89 , on the @entity6 border to @entity86 's @entity178 , watch the battle the @entity180 , @entity181 's official affiliate in @entity23 , withdrew from the province			1
the @entity6 government still controls a portion of @entity23 city and its airport			2
‘ secrecy is the most important element of @entity19 's work , ’ said mr @entity58			1
the group comprises four - man ‘ cells ’ that work independently of each other , he added			0
one of @entity19 's biggest operations was an attack on an @entity8 position in @entity97 in which around 11 @entity8 fighters were killed , according to the @entity74 and mr @entity58			1
the @entity41 - led air strikes are not making @entity19 's job easier , said mr @entity58			2
where @entity8 fighters once used to gather in large numbers , they now move in small groups , often at night , using motor bikes			1
@entity19 's spokesman said the group is using weapons that formerly belonged to @entity62 rebel groups			2
the spokesman , who gave his name as @entity211 , claimed that despite its modest resources , @entity19 had achieved its goal			0
he said : ‘ the aim of this group - spreading fear among @entity0 members - has been realised			0
