in 1996 , 12 months before @entity40 's first electoral landslide , @entity5 was on 45 per cent with @entity41 's @entity7 on just 28 per cent			1
labour under mr @entity13 was also ahead in 1986 and 1991 , before being beaten by the @entity7 a year later			1
the polls are certain to trigger fears in @entity5 ranks that the party is failing to ' seal the deal ' with voters with a year until mr @entity2 tries to take power			1

' to counter the criticism , mr @entity2 today insisted he was better than mr @entity3			0
the @entity5 leader played down the significance of a set of polls which showed conservatives establishing a lead over his party for the first time since @entity109 's ' omnishambles ' budget more than two years ago			0
two surveys - an @entity12 poll for @entity33 and another carried out for @entity62 peer @entity112 - gave mr @entity3 's party a two - point lead , a year ahead of the 2015 general election			1
just days ahead of elections to @entity119 councils and the @entity120 on may 22 , mr @entity2 insisted he was right to focus on the ' cost - of - living crisis ' facing @entity122 families			0
despite positive economic figures over recent months , ordinary people were ' deeply discontented ' with the way in which the country is being run , and feel that the benefits from growth have been skewed towards those at the top of society , he said			0
challenged over whether voters saw him as a potential prime minister , mr @entity2 told @entity136 's breakfast : ' my approach has been to talk consistently about the big questions our country faces and the biggest question of all that every country is wrestling with - are we going to be run for a few people at the top , with growing gaps between the richest and everybody else , or are ordinary people going to get a fair shot ? ' i am going to keep talking consistently about that , because i think that is the biggest question our country faces			2
' asked if this approach would make him a better pm than mr @entity3 , the @entity5 leader said : ' it makes me more personally competent because i get what people are feeling and we can do something about it			2
' the most important thing as a prime minister is to understand what people think and what you can do about it and to show the difference you can make to their lives , and that 's what i will do , and solidity of belief and purpose			0
' @entity3 and @entity170 celebrate winning a table football game yesterday , as the first poll emerged putting the @entity7 ahead the @entity12 poll for the @entity33 , released as @entity176 president @entity175 's former campaign guru @entity174 arrived in @entity177 to begin work with mr @entity2 's party , put the conservatives on 33 per cent , with @entity5 sliding six points since april to 31 per cent , @entity182 on 15 per cent - a four point gain since last month - and the @entity184 up one point to 13 per cent			1

but mr @entity2 said : ' polls go up and down			0
i 've seen that over three and a half years in this job			0
i think what matters is talking about the bread and butter issues people face - energy prices , childcare , the @entity207 , how we can improve gp access , something @entity5 is leading the other parties on			2
' we will talk about the issues that matter to people			0
we will focus on these questions			0
the people will make the decisions a week on thursday and at the general election			1
' mr @entity2 said he was ' very disappointed ' at the government 's response to his high - profile announcement yesterday of a @entity5 promise to give all @entity207 patients access to a gp within 48 hours			2
' they say doctors ca n't deliver it , ' he said			0
' they are writing off the idea that we can deliver appointments in 48 hours and so we are going to have to wait more than a week			0
that 's not good enough			0
i 'm determined we can make a difference			0
