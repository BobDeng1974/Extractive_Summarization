a renowned pathologist testified he could not determine whether a neurologist was fatally poisoned by her husband , a @entity3 medical researcher on trial for criminal homicide			1
dr. @entity6 said he reached that conclusion based on conflicting blood test results and evidence that dr. @entity11 's death could have been due to another cause , such as a heart problem			1
' you 've got a mixed batch and that 's what leads me at this point and today to the conclusion that it 's undetermined , ' @entity6 said , when asked about the cause and manner of @entity11 's death			2
@entity6 was among the last defense witnesses being called wednesday , the 10th day of testimony in the trial of dr. @entity28 , @entity24 prosecutors say @entity28 laced his 41 - year - old wife 's energy drink with cyanide in april 2013 , moments before she fell suddenly ill in their kitchen			1
she died three days later			0
dr @entity28 ( left ) is currently on trial for criminal homicide after his wife , neurologist @entity11 ( right ) , died in april 2013			1
prosecutors say @entity11 was murdered with a dose of cyanide , but an expert testified wednesday that she could have actually died from a heart problem previous testimony has suggested @entity11 was pressuring @entity28 to have another child — the couple , married in 2001 , had a 6 - year - old daughter when @entity11 died — and that @entity28 had texted @entity11 to suggest the energy drink might help them conceive			1
other testimony showed someone used @entity28 's computers to search for information on cyanide poisoning in the weeks before @entity11 died and , after she died but before he was arrested , on how a coroner might detect the poison			1
the defense called @entity6 to counter blood test evidence and a prosecution expert 's testimony that @entity11 was poisoned			2
a test done by @entity58 on blood drawn from @entity11 hours after she collapsed in her home showed a lethal level of cyanide			2
but that result was n't known to investigators until after @entity11 was dead and her body cremated			2
if convicted , dr @entity28 ( center ) could stand to spend the rest of his life in prison			1
pictured above in court on october 23 a county crime lab test also confirmed cyanide in @entity11 's blood , but not a specific level			2
the medical examiner 's office then sent another blood sample to @entity81 , which could n't test the blood because of an equipment malfunction and because a calibrating experiment indicated another testing method was n't reliable			0
@entity81 eventually found a cyanide metabolite — a substance created when the poison is broken down in the bloodstream — but only at a level that could normally occur in a person 's blood			0
previous testimony has suggested @entity11 was pressuring @entity28 to have another child and that @entity28 had texted @entity11 to suggest the energy drink might help them conceive			1
investigators believe that drink was poisoned @entity6 said the disparity between the @entity58 and @entity81 results left him unable to definitively determine the cause and manner of @entity11 's death			0
' one would lead me to determine it 's a homicide , ' @entity6 said , ' while the other leads me to believe it was a natural death			0
' @entity6 , who served two separate 10 - year terms as county coroner , is well known in the @entity111 area and is a celebrity of sorts nationally , having consulted on the deaths of @entity115 and @entity116 , among others			0
he first gained widespread fame as a critic of the @entity121 's conclusion that @entity122 alone assassinated president @entity123 in 1963			0
the prosecution 's main expert , a @entity127 professor who wrote a book on criminal poisoning , dr. @entity124 , previously discounted the possibility that @entity11 died from a heart arrhythmia or some other sudden , unexplained cause because he said the evidence for other causes was lacking			1
@entity6 said he could n't rule out natural causes because of what he considers conflicting blood test results			0
' that 's the basis for my opinion , ' @entity6 said			0
' the defense expected to call some brief witnesses before resting wednesday			0
closing arguments were expected thursday , after which the jury will be sequestered until a verdict			0
the prosecution is seeking a first - degree murder conviction , which carries a mandatory life prison sentence .			1
