by @entity0 published : 22:14 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 22:15 est , 30 may 2012 @entity2 authorities said a @entity4 doctor who helped the @entity5 track down @entity6 turned down an opportunity to leave his country and resettle overseas with his family , according to @entity2 officials			1
dr. @entity11 was jailed last week in @entity4 for 33 years for treason and president @entity14 's administration has come under steady criticism for its handling of his case			1
the unnamed @entity2 officials said the resettlement offer for @entity11 came around the time of the may 1 , 2011 , raid in which @entity22 commandos killed the @entity24 leader at his complex in @entity26 , @entity4			1
@entity4 doctor @entity11 talks with people outside a building at an unknown location in @entity4 , before his imprisonment this month at a tribal court they indicated that @entity11 's family would have been welcome to leave @entity4 with him as part of the resettlement plan			2
the officials said he rejected the offer for reasons that are unclear			0
' before he was arrested , doctor @entity11 was offered opportunities to leave @entity4 with his family but he turned those down , ' one of the @entity2 officials said			1
' some may question why he did this but no one , including the doctor , could have foreseen that @entity4 would punish so severely someone whose work benefited the country so much			0
' dr. @entity11 helped the @entity5 track down @entity6 and turned down an opportunity to leave @entity4 and resettle overseas with his family dr. @entity11 was ran a fake vaccination campaign in @entity26 and used cheek swabs to try to gather dna from @entity6 's children to confirm the identity of those living in the compound before the may 2011 raid			1
the @entity53 effort ultimately did not succeed but @entity2 sources have told @entity60 he helped @entity2 operatives locate and follow the @entity6 courier who led them to the @entity26 hideout			0
the offer for @entity11 to leave @entity4 was confirmed independently by two @entity2 officials			1
the @entity66 and @entity67 declined comment on the matter			0
@entity11 's case has damaged @entity2 - @entity4 relations with outraged @entity2 senators voting last week to cut aid to @entity4 by $ 33 million - $ 1 million for each year of the doctor 's prison sentence			1
@entity2 officials said the resettlement offer for @entity11 came about the time of the may 1 , 2011 , raid in which @entity22 commandos killed @entity6 ' it 's arbitrary , but the hope is that @entity4 will realise we are serious , ' said senator @entity84 , the @entity86 's second - highest - ranking @entity85			1
the @entity2 secretary of state , @entity87 , added he disapproval and called the doctor 's jailing ' unjust and unwarranted ' and vowed to press the case with @entity91			0
@entity4 has said @entity92 should respect its court 's decision			0
@entity4 authorities arrested @entity11 several weeks after the @entity6 raid			2
in the intervening period , @entity2 authorities believed they would have had ample time to get him out of the country if he had wanted to leave			0
mission : the @entity24 leader was killed at this compound in @entity26 by @entity104 another official said it was not usual for people in @entity11 's situation to reject resettlement offers the official said @entity11 may have believed that rather than becoming the object of character attacks and accusations of treason by @entity4 authorities , he might instead have won praise for his role in helping rid @entity4 of a threat to its security and stability			2
and in another twist to a case that is straining @entity91 's ties with @entity92 , a @entity4 court says the doctor who helped the @entity2 find @entity6 was imprisoned for aiding militants and not for his links to the @entity5			1
it is the third different explanation for the 33 - year jail sentence handed to dr. @entity11			2
last week after his conviction by a court in the @entity134 tribal region near the @entity136 border , @entity4 officials said the decision was based on treason charges for aiding the @entity5 in its hunt for the @entity24 chief			0
when that announcement rankled @entity2 officials , @entity4 then said the doctor had a history of womanising			2
tense : the moment president @entity14 and his team watched the mission to find @entity6 in the @entity149 of the @entity66 on may 1 , 2011 but the judgment document made available to the media on wednesday states that @entity11 was jailed because of his close ties to the banned militant group @entity153 , which amounts to waging war against the state			0
it is unclear why @entity4 officials first said @entity11 was jailed over his links to the @entity5			2
one of the doctor 's lawyers , @entity160 , was baffled after reading the verdict , which he also received on wednesday			0
both secretary of state @entity87 and secretary of defense @entity162 have expressed their displeasure at dr @entity11 's imprisonment ' these charges against him are very different from the ones we were told earlier , ' said @entity160			0
@entity11 's brother @entity168 has described the treason charges as baseless and said the doctor was being made a scapegoat			0
' if my brother had done something wrong , he had a valid @entity2 visa			0
he could have fled the country , ' said @entity168 after the sentence was handed down , adding that the family had received no offers of help from the @entity2 government the compound , within which @entity24 leader @entity6 was killed , is seen in flames after it was attacked in @entity26 in this still image taken from video footage from a mobile phone may 2 , 2011 @entity6 was killed after a meticulously planned @entity22 raid on his @entity26 home in @entity4 in may 2011 in @entity92 , government sources said the @entity2 is making strenuous efforts to win @entity11 's release from jail			1
@entity2 officials hail @entity11 as a hero who helped the @entity5 track down @entity6 , who was killed by @entity22 in a raid in the @entity4 town of @entity26 in may last year			1
defense secretary @entity162 suggested on sunday that the jailing of @entity11 would hurt efforts to repair relations			0
many @entity4 were infuriated by the @entity2 raid to get @entity6 in a town just a two - hour drive from @entity91 and they see @entity11 as a villain who conspired against the state and brought unwanted scrutiny of @entity4 's attitude to militants			1
@entity4 officials describe @entity6 's long presence in the garrison town of @entity26 as a security lapse and reject suggestions that members of the military or intelligence services were complicit in hiding him there .			1

reports from @entity4 also suggest that dr. @entity11 was sentenced for links to @entity220 militants and not for aiding @entity2 intelligence services
