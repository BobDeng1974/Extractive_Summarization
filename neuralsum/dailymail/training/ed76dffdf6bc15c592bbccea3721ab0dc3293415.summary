public opinion about the @entity5 is too influenced by the sitcom blackadder , the minister in charge of marking the centenary of the conflict has warned			2
defence minister dr @entity7 said commemorations next year were an opportunity to ‘ balance ’ the way the @entity13 series distorted the reality of the @entity5			1
but he insisted that the government was not trying to dictate ‘ approved versions of history ’			2
sitcom : the @entity22 comedy @entity20 , starring ( left to right ) @entity23 , @entity13 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , gives a distorted view of the @entity5 , mps were told an ambitious £ 50million programme of events is planned to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 1914			1
schoolchildren from every state secondary school will travel to the @entity5 battlefields as part of the commemorations , with communities across the @entity38 urged to organise events			1
during a @entity41 debate on the plans today , dr @entity7 said the events were a chance to ‘ improve ’ the nation ’s ‘ grasp ’ of @entity5			1
he singled out @entity46 , and the 1960s @entity48 musical oh ! @entity49 , for distorting what people thought really happened on the frontline			2
dr @entity7 , who was a surgeon commander with the @entity53 serving in the @entity54 between 1990/91 and in @entity55 in 2003 , told @entity19 : ‘ improvement of our grasp of the causes , conduct and consequences of the @entity5 must be at the heart of the centenary that is about to break upon us			1
events : defence minister dr @entity7 , a @entity53 surgeon , said he wanted to rebalance what people knew of the war ‘ because there are those who are asking what 's the point of it all , we risk disconnection from a defining event of our time and an opportunity , perhaps , to balance the @entity78 / @entity46 take on history , that has sadly been in the ascendant for the past 50 years			1
‘ and in its place i hope we will have a richer , deeper and more reflective legacy			2
’ last month @entity85 presenter @entity84 said it was ‘ astonishing ’ that children were being shown @entity20 in school to teach them about the @entity5 , @entity84			0
he said he thought it was because ‘ it is much easier to imagine the @entity5 with the help of other people ’s imaginations ’			0
the @entity85 presenter said he believed people ’s difficulty in understanding the war originated in the fact ‘ we have been accustomed to seeing the @entity5 as poetry rather than history			0
’ in the @entity101 said the events were even more important because there were no surviving veterans from the battlefields			1
‘ we must commemorate this centenary because with the passing in 2009 of @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , our last tangible links with the @entity5 are retreating into the shadows , ’ he said			1
but he insisted that government would not dictate the terms of any such debate regarding the nation 's understanding of war			0
‘ the role of government in the centenary , is to lead , encourage and help make it all happen , whilst avoiding the temptation to prescribe			0
‘ it is emphatically not the place of government in our 21st century liberal democracy handing down approved versions of history			0
’ memories : the deaths of @entity5 veterans ( left to right ) @entity112 , @entity110 , and @entity111 broke the ' last tangible link ' with the conflict , dr @entity7 said @entity137 ’s shadow defence minister @entity136 said commemoration not celebration was the appropriate tone for events			1
he added : ‘ the facts of @entity5 can not be counted in terms of just battlefield casualties or military innovations			0
‘ by dint of its influence and its timing , and the wider social change it brought about , it is the single most significant event of the 20th century			0
‘ as such , it is something we must commemorate , we must learn from , and we must educate our children about			0
‘ but above all we must remember , because it is only through remembering we will truly understand the impact @entity5 has had on @entity38 society and in doing so understand what it means to be @entity38			0
