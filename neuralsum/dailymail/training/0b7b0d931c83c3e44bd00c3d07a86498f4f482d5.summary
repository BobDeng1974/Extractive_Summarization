it was a diet forced upon families during the @entity2			1
but one @entity4 fanatic is planning on living off food rationing for a month to mark the 75th anniversary of its introduction in the @entity9			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , will be living off forgotten dishes such as @entity15 pie , mince slices and corn beef pie to raise money for the @entity19			1
she is hoping to raise money for the @entity19 the 34 - year - old is only buying food that was allowed in a 1940s ration book a typical day 's food intake during this month would be oatmeal and water with a touch of sugar for breakfast ; soup , stew or left overs from the night before for lunch and something substantial such as pie for dinner			1
100g of bacon and ham 450g of meat 50g of butter 50g of cheese 100g of margarine 100g of cooking fat three pints of milk 112g of preserves ( 450 to last whole month ) 1 shell egg ( to last whole month ) 225g sugar 50g of tea 87g of sweets ( 350g to last whole month ) the 34 - year - old , who started the project on january 8 , starts her day with oatmeal with water , followed by leftovers for lunch and a hefty pie for tea			1
and one of the unexpected benefits of sticking to a rations ' diet has been the cost of @entity10 's shopping - which has dropped to just £ 10 a week			1
she said : ' i have always wanted to do it			1
' i am obsessed with the 1940s and 1950s			1
i decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at @entity72			1
@entity10 admits she used to ' buy everything going ' but realised the huge difference in lifestyles when she watched a wartime programme on tv			1
' i watched the @entity78 @entity72 special and saw how they came together as a community			2
it is so different how we used to do @entity72 , ' she said			2
' it has made me realise how much money i waste on food			1
i have hardly spent anything			2
' i am so used to convenience and just grabbing something out of the freezer or ringing for a takeaway			2
' i feel 10 times better for it			1
i do n't think i want to go back to eating as much as i used to , but i am looking forward to having something stodgy and a glass of wine			2
forgotten dishes such as @entity15 pie , mince slices and corn beef pie , feature heavily in her meals the occupational therapist prepares wartime meals like bean medley ( left ) and corn beef hash ( right ) @entity10 got 2015 off to a good start by using her 16 - point monthly allowance to buy a tin of corned beef and ditching the alcohol - which was hard to come by in those days			1
the challenge has meant that she must concentrate her allowances - a tin of @entity114 would cost eight points - although that has n't seen her lacking for food			1
rations for the month have included meat , butter , cheese , margarine , cooking fat , milk , sugar , preserves , tea , eggs and sweets			2
and while at first glance the list might not look that bad , ms @entity10 's 50 grams of cheese and three pints of milk have to last her a week			1
ms @entity10 says she ' decided to do it after seeing how much food everyone buys at @entity72 ' ms @entity10 said : ' i have had the good , old corned beef , but i have avoided the spam so far			1
' i have also eaten a lot of vegetables and a lot of soup			2
' so far , her favourite meal has been fish cakes in which she uses cod , mashed potato a carrot and half a rasher of bacon to make			2
the bean medley - made up mainly of 84 grams haricot beans , a teaspoon of treacle , 141 grams of mixed vegetables and 14 grams of chopped bacon - is her worst meal			1
' i hate baked beans , so i do n't know why i thought i would give it a try , ' she said			2
' but in those days you would not have been able to waste it , so i have fought my way through , even if i hated eating it			2
' @entity10 will be continuing with her challenge until 29 @entity164 donate , visit @entity165			1
