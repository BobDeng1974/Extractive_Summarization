what if someone took your greatest insecurities and body image fears , and voiced them out loud ? known for its empowering campaigns and championing of real women , @entity5 has taken a more brutal approach in its latest advertisement			1
showing the harsh criticism that women regularly heap upon themselves , @entity5 decided to see what would happen when somebody else said those things , to their faces			1
the women filled in a notebook each , and handed it back to @entity5 unbeknownst to the women , those negative remarks and self - body shaming were turned into a script created in @entity31 , @entity5 asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook			1
the beauty brand then took the notes away with them			0
unbeknownst to the women , those criticisms , negative remarks and tirades of self body - shaming were turned into a script			2
what happened next , shocked them all			0
@entity5 recruited two undercover actresses to read the script , created using the notes each of the women made about themselves , while they were all within earshot			1
their reactions were priceless the comments featured in the actresses ' scripted dialogue were harsh , cutting and bordering on bullying played out by two actresses , the script was read aloud as dialogue in a cafe , where the women themselves had been invited for coffee			2
in the experiment set up by @entity5 , the women heard the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other , out loud			1
making for a shocking scene , the script , which contained nothing but the original notes , was cutting to say the least			0
one woman felt insecure about her teeth , noting that she thought they made her look like a mouse when the actresses repeated the insecurity out loud , while sitting on the next table , her shock was obvious in one scenario , a customer sitting on a nearby table , not involved in the experiment , even intervenes			2
' your arms are too big , your silhouette is all squashed , ' reads one remark written by a woman who looks no bigger than a size eight			0
' sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big , ' the same woman continues			0
several of the women 's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we 'd all frown upon in one scenario , a customer sitting on a nearby table , not involved in the experiment , even intervened several of the women 's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we 'd all immediately frown upon			2
' with your little baby teeth you look like a mouse , ' says one			0
while another , ' your face looks like a bulldog , ' when said out loud underlines the way many women effectively bully themselves every single day			1
visibly shocked by the comments , the women recognise the dialogue as their own notes			0
' i hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that , ' says one , moved to tears by the shock of the experiment visibly shocked by the comments , the women recognise the dialogue as their own notes			1
' i hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that , ' says one			1
while another concedes , ' yes that 's what i say to myself all day long			0
now , i get how violent it is ! ' many of the comments written in the notebooks , when said out loud , underline the way lots of women are effectively bullying themselves every single day , by focusing on their insecurities and never their beauty if you would n't speak so harshly to a friend , why do it to yourself ? @entity143 campaign is yet another in @entity5 's line of powerful videos , which all aim to encourage women to be kinder to themselves and each other @entity143 campaign is yet another in @entity5 's line of powerful videos			1
ahead of the 2015 @entity152 in february , the beauty brand teamed up with @entity153 to create the # @entity155 video			0
aired during the @entity158 show , the short clip championed the message , ' let 's change the way we talk about beauty on @entity153 , after revealing that last year women sent over five million negative tweets about body image .			0

@entity5 took self criticisms from real women and repeated them out loud
created in @entity31 , campaign *highlights* the way we bully ourselves daily
' i hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that '
