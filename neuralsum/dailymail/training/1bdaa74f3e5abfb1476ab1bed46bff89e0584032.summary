@entity1 police said they have identified more than one person of interest over the unsolved murder of four prostitutes whose bodies were found in @entity7 in november 2006			1
no suspects have yet been named , but the case has taken officers from the bright lights of @entity7 in @entity1 , to @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
the women , aged between 19 and 42 , had been killed and their bodies dumped within 50 yards of each other in a drainage ditch close to the town 's casinos			1
discovery : @entity22 , 35 , was found first victim : @entity24 , 19 , was killed first police told @entity26 they were ' quietly and aggressively working the case ' , and that their investigation had taken them across the @entity29 as they tried to make connections with similar killings			1
the search for the serial killer began in november 2006 , when two women found the body of @entity22 , 35			1
she was laying face down in run - off water filled with fecal matter and chemical waste , behind the @entity41			0
when police arrived they found the bodies of three other women , all barefoot but clothed , in the same ditch , all of them prostitutes			1
because their shoes were missing it led to speculation that the killer may have a foot fetish , and had kept the shoes as a trophy , according to the @entity58			2
miss @entity22 , and the other victims - 19 - year - old @entity24 , @entity60 , 23 , and @entity61 , 42 - all had children , and all had been forced to turn to the sex trade for money			0
miss @entity60 and @entity65 , who were the more recent victims , had been strangled , but the bodies of @entity68 , the first victim , and @entity70 were so decomposed a cause of death could not be established			2
only two of them had been reported missing before the bodies were found			0
attack : @entity60 , 23 , had been strangled killed : @entity61 , 42 , was the oldest victim ' this fits the @entity81 definition of a serial killer , ' @entity78 prosecutor @entity77 said last week			1
' from the facts gathered during the investigation , it could have been a local person or it could have been a transient			0
' @entity87 , a spokesman for the @entity88 , said it was likely that other women had encountered the killer , but did not report it to police for fear of a prostitution arrest			2
despite the case remaining unsolved for seven years however , mr @entity96 said it did not mean police were not concerned about prostitutes			1
' no one should ever think that because someone works as a prostitute or works in the sex trade that they ’re not going to get law enforcement ’s best efforts			0
everybody counts , ' he said			0
mr @entity77 , who is the third prosecutor to take office since the bodies was found , added : ' i have great hope in justice			0
i ’ll never give up on that			0
' the case has been linked previously to the ten bodies found in @entity116 in 2010			2
the month before she was killed , miss @entity22 had been staying a motel close to where the bodies were found in @entity120			2
the connection led authorities in 2011 to question whether the killer used several methods of murder and display in order to confuse authorities , or if more than one murderer was involved , according to the examiner .			0

case has taken *detectives* from @entity12 to @entity14 as they try to catch killer
women were found strangled and barefoot in drainage ditch behind motel
no suspects have yet been named seven years after unsolved killings
