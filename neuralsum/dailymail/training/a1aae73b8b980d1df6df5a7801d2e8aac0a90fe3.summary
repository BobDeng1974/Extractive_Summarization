seven planets in the @entity4 outside our solar system could potentially harbour life , researchers from an ambitious project to catalogue all habitable worlds have announced			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) celebrated its first anniversary with the announcement that it had exceeded expectations in its search for possible new earths			1
lead researcher @entity14 , director of the @entity15 at @entity17 's @entity16 , said the team had hoped to add perhaps one or two planets in the project 's first year			1
' @entity21 ' : a collage of computer generated images of possibly habitable worlds made to celebrate the first year of the @entity16 's @entity8			1
@entity26 is at the top right the addition of five possibly habitable planets over the two already known totally exceeded anyone 's expectations , he said			1
' there are many press releases announcing discoveries of habitable planets ... and that is confusing , ' professor @entity14 told @entity38			1
' so having a catalog that everyone can check what is available right now is useful			2
' with scientists improving their techniques for finding planets outside the solar system , the pace of discovery is increasing , he added			2
the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) instrument in @entity51 and the orbiting @entity52 are just two of the tools helping researchers find new exoplanets every month			2
in order of discovery : professor @entity14 's team at the @entity16 launched the @entity8 in december last year			1
it was conceived out of the need to measure the suitability for life of these emerging worlds and as a way to organise them for the general public			2
there are nearly 80 confirmed exoplanets with a similar size to @entity26 but only a few of those have the right distance from their star to support liquid water on the surface , the researchers say			2
the catalogue uses habitability assessments like the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , the @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , classification systems , and comparisons with @entity26 past and present			0
however the exoplanet classifications use the word terran instead of ‘ @entity26 - size ’ to avoid a strict comparison with @entity26 since many of these worlds might have some physical similarities with @entity26 but might not necessary be @entity26 - like			0

the image corrects for the size , colours , and brightness of the star and sky as seen from an @entity26 - like world			0
the size of and colours of the star of kepler - 22b look similar to @entity26 because it orbits a @entity107 - like star			0
the sunsets of @entity109 and 581d look much redder because they orbit a red dwarf star , with the sky of @entity109 581d much darker due to its greater distance			0
the star of @entity115 is the brightest of all cases although the star of @entity109 is the biggest seven potentially habitable exoplanets are now listed by @entity8 , including the disputed @entity120 , plus some 27 more from @entity122 candidates waiting for confirmation			1
but the organisation cautions that while these are objects of interest for further astronomical observations , there is no guarantee on the habitability or even the existence of many of these planets			0
it will take many new observations , and more ground and space observatories to verify and characterize these objects , the @entity8 team says			1
the @entity8 was launched , december 5th , 2011 , the same day that the @entity122 team announced the discovery of @entity141 during the @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144			1
the first confirmed extrasolar planets , or exoplanets , were discovered from the @entity17 20 years ago , in 1992			0
these were extreme planets around the pulsar @entity149 +12			0
in 1995 the planet 51 pegasi b was discovered around a more typical @entity107 - like star			0
today scientists know of nearly 900 confirmed exoplanets with over 2,500 still awaiting confirmation			0
however only a few of those might be candidates for life as we know it			0
it started with just two planets , @entity162 and hd 85512b			0
later , @entity141 , @entity109 , @entity120 , @entity164 , and hd 40307g were added , in chronological order			0
all these exoplanets are superterrans , aka @entity169 , and quite larger than @entity26 but still considered potentially habitable			2
scientists have not yet found a true @entity26 analogue			0
the @entity8 is now a very complex computer program that incorporates data from many exoplanet databases , such as the @entity175 and @entity176 , plus many updates from other research groups			1
it receives most of the data of new relevant discoveries directly from the research teams , which is then analysed and added to the catalog at the moment of their public announcement			0
in the coming year , the @entity8 will be expanded with new models and analysis , which is expected to affect many of the objects listed and offer new visualisations and habitability assessments			1
however , the biggest impact will come not from changes in the @entity8 's maths , but from new discoveries , the team says			1
' a true @entity26 analogue or a potentially habitable exomoon would be big discoveries , ' they said			2
' certainly , this was the right time to start mapping the habitable universe around us			2

habitable @entity8 says first year has exceeded expectations
it was launched in december 2011 with just two *entries* in its database
finds expected to *accelerate* as *methods* become more *sophisticated*
