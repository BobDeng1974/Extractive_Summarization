by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 16:43 est , 22 may 2013 for many , @entity1 remains the best rugby game ever created			1
although @entity6 maestros @entity4 tried to tackle the rugby market , each attempt paled in comparison to @entity10 ' 1997 classic			0
but that has n't stopped @entity12 , the developers behind countless rugby league games , trying their hand at what 's proving to be a difficult sport to crack			1
@entity18 's the word : @entity20 may have some flaws , but it 's on course to be a solid sports game first impressions are promising			2
menu screens are clear and crisp , and there 's a @entity6 - style glossiness to the animated background			1
content is rich , too , boasting a @entity30 , competition , online and career modes to name but a few			2
it 's also heavily licenced - with more than 110 teams and 50 stadia looking exactly how they should			1
this includes heavy hitters such as the @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41 , not to mention smaller teams in the @entity43 and @entity44			2
unfortunately , @entity46 teams are not licenced			1
but for all of this authenticity , the gameplay feels very arcade like - a move which may anger purists			1
fast and ferocious , there 's often so much happening on screen that it 's difficult to tell what 's going on			0
core mechanics such as passing , tackling and kicking work well , though , and although @entity59 running lines are not as refined as rugby fans may like , it 's still very enjoyable			1
less enjoyable are the tedious scrum and lineout mechanics			0
both involve time - sensitive button and controller presses to ensure success , but the margin for error is extremely punishing			2
the decision to put all out - of - hand kicking into slow - motion , too , also jars with the ebb and flow of a match			2
graphically , @entity20 2 largely looks the part			0
enjoyed best from a side - on perspective , animations generally hold together and stadiums are nicely detailed			0
character models are less impressive , which is shame , given the number tv - style close - ups and replays broadcast during matches			1
@entity85 has been noticeably improved since 2011 's @entity20			0
former @entity39 @entity86 is on hand offering insightful quips and critique while @entity90 follows the core action			0
sadly , commentary is not quite as smooth as you 'd hope for , and more than once during the match - was n't accurate to what was going on on - screen			0
arcade : harking back to the days of @entity1 , realistic gameplay has taken a back seat but these minor gripes aside , on this evidence , @entity20 2 still looks like a strong rugby game , one that 's sure to please many die - hard rugby fans			1
@entity104 : the @entity105 is released on june 13			0
follow us on @entity107 : @ @entity108 and on @entity109 : @entity110 .			0

@entity112 , clear menus and packed full of game modes
core gameplay remains true to the sport - bar the odd @entity59 hiccup
fully licenced teams but lack of @entity46 licence is a shame
