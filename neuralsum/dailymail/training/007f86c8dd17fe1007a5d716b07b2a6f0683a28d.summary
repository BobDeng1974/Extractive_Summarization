by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 18:42 est , 10 october 2013 public sector workers are still earning up to £ 3,200 a year more than their private sector equivalents			1
even after a three - year squeeze on the millions employed by the state , they continue to enjoy an average ‘ pay premium ’ of more than six per cent , a report reveals today			0
in some parts of the @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11 , public sector workers are paid as much as 14 per cent more – or £ 3,200 a year on average			1
discrepancies : in some parts of @entity16 public sector workers are still earning up to £ 3,200 a year more than their private sector equivalents however , in central @entity19 , the @entity9 and @entity20 , the average public sector worker is paid less than they would if they were working in the private sector			1
the scale of the regional variations , uncovered by centre - right think - tank @entity25 , will lead to renewed calls to end national pay bargaining for the public sector and have regional scales instead			2
chancellor @entity31 has warned that public sector pay levels are so out of kilter in some regions that they are squeezing out the private sector , and suggested that they should be made ‘ more responsive ’ to local labour markets			1
however , the @entity39 boasted at their annual conference last month that they had blocked @entity42 attempts to bring in regional variations			0
today ’s report finds that more than 12 per cent of national income – £ 180 billion – is spent on public sector pay			1
on average , a public sector worker benefits from a 6.1 per cent pay premium , earning as much as £ 1,400 a year more than someone in the private sector			1
women tend to have larger pay premiums than men			0
the average premium has been relatively steady since mid- 2010 , suggesting that the @entity56 ’s freeze on public sector pay is starting to address the balance			1
the report recommends abolishing national pay deals in favour of a system that reflects local labour markets and rewards performance			0
rebalancing the pay and pensions of public sector workers so that they are in line with the private sector would save £ 6.3billion a year , the think - tank says			1
this could be used to create at least 288,000 private sector jobs in some of the poorest parts of the country			2
today ’s report finds that more than 12 per cent of national income – £ 180 billion – is spent on public sector pay @entity78 , head of economics and social policy at @entity25 , said : ‘ nationalised pay negotiation is not fit for purpose for the modern public sector			1
it is bad for the economy and bad for public services			0
‘ we should move to a system where local public sector employers can decide how to negotiate salaries with employees in order to reflect the realities of their local labour market			0
‘ at the same time as freeing up money for infrastructure and local growth projects , this will enable top performing public sector workers to be paid more			1
’ but @entity103 general secretary @entity102 said : ‘ cutting pay in those parts of the country sharing least in the much delayed and rather shallow recovery makes no economic sense			0
it will make the north - south divide even greater			0
‘ and it will make inequality within regions greater too , as the biggest losers from these proposals will be low - paid staff in the public sector			2
‘ we should be spreading the living wage in both public and private sectors , not listening to these divisive and unfair proposals from well - off @entity19 think - tank wonks			0
’ @entity121 , @entity122 general secretary , said the public sector includes a raft of highly skilled jobs that are not represented in the private sector , such as judges , lecturers , doctors , army generals and senior civil servants			1
‘ the idea that there is a public sector pay premium is a myth and dressing it up with dodgy statistics still wo n’t make it true , ’ he said			2
‘ the real pay difference is between those at the top and the bottom – the bankers and financiers who are still raking in the bonuses			0
’ mr @entity31 has announced that pay restraint in the public sector is to continue at least until the next election			2
a two - year pay freeze is being followed by a pay rise cap of one per cent for two further years			0
and the number of predicted public sector job losses under the government ’s austerity measures has risen to 710,000 by 2016/17 .			0

public sector pay is 14 *%* more in parts of the @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11
but in central @entity19 , the @entity9 and @entity20 public sector workers are paid on average less than those in the private sector
