last night @entity41 air traffic controllers were reported by airlines to be calling a ‘ siesta strike ’ – from noon to 2pm today – which will disrupt and delay some flights			1
controllers in both countries are protesting against a planned overhaul of aviation by the @entity49 to create what has been nicknamed ‘ a single @entity8 sky ’			2
