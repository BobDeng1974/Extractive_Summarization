by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 took on @entity3 in a penalty shootout and won , but not without the helping hand of a big @entity6			2
for @entity7 was @entity9 's hero as they overcame hosts @entity10 7 - 6 following a dire goalless draw in @entity13			1
the stopper saved from @entity15 and then , decisively , from @entity16 as a tedious contest reached a thrilling climax hardly in keeping with the previous 90 minutes			1
at long last : @entity9 celebrate beating @entity10 on penalties after a 0 - 0 draw @entity6 : @entity7 was the hero for the @entity9 , saving the final spot - kick @entity9 : @entity7 ; @entity22 , @entity23 ( @entity24 46 ) , @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity27 ( @entity28 78 ) , @entity29 ( @entity30 54 ) , @entity31 , @entity32 ( @entity33 54 ) ; @entity34 ; @entity35 ( @entity36 83 ) @entity10 : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 62 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 62 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 46 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity15 46 ) , @entity50 @entity51 , @entity52 , 1:2 @entity25 , @entity47 , @entity53 , 3:2 @entity54 , 3 : 3 @entity36 , @entity7 parried against @entity15 , @entity31 3:4 , 4:4 @entity44 , 4:5 @entity55 , 5:5 @entity56 , 5:6 @entity26 , @entity57 6:6 , 6:7 @entity33			1
in an arduous first half , @entity10 's @entity43 escaped down the right before centring and @entity7 had to be on his guard to save at the near post			2
@entity45 took aim from range for the hosts and was unlucky to see his effort whistle narrowly over the crossbar			0
@entity68 international @entity43 looked @entity10 's best bet for a goal and he cracked the base of the post having seized on a mistake by @entity25			0
the same player the drilled wide from distance before teeing up @entity41 whose effort was saved by @entity77			0
the former @entity78 international was again called into action before the break as he got down low to repel defender @entity83 's measured steer after @entity10 had worked a short corner into the area			0
strong : @entity25 of @entity9 does well to tackle @entity10 star @entity41 on saturday pinned to his chair : @entity9 boss @entity87 watches on from the sidelines in @entity13 on the run : @entity22 looks to make things happen for @entity9 it was from a corner after half - time that the @entity9 got their first real sight at goal , @entity27 's floater landed on the forehead of @entity25 but he flashed wide when unmarked just six yards out			2
@entity83 then struck the post following a goalmouth scramble midway through the second period but chances were at a premium as the half wore on			0
and so it was that @entity7 emerged the hero as @entity87 celebrated his first victory of a difficult pre-season which has seen @entity107 ruled out for four months because of an ankle injury and co-owner @entity109 ' favourite ' a @entity112 post criticising the boss			1
midfielder @entity114 was then remanded in custody after being charged with two counts of common assault			0
but @entity9 will emerge as @entity119 victors should they beat @entity120 on sunday afternoon			1
great support : the travelling @entity9 faithful make themselves heard in the 2006 @entity124 stadium settling in : @entity29 enjoyed some vital pre-season game time before being substituted new signing : @entity127 watches on ... while parent club @entity129 storm to a 5 - 1 victory in the @entity131			1

@entity7 saves *crucial* penalty for @entity9
*hammers* had yet to win pre-season game before beating hosts in @entity119
thrilling climax was hardly in keeping with dull 90 minutes
