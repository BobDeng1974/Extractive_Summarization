by @entity0 published : 05:08 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 05:09 est , 23 october 2013 @entity2 researchers have created a ‘ super horse ’ with @entity5 printed titanium shoes they say could give racehorses a major advantage			1
the horse , nicknamed ‘ @entity9 ’ , had its hooves scanned with a handheld 3d scanner			1
using 3d modelling software , the scan was then used to design the perfect fitting , lightweight racing shoe			0
here , researcher @entity15 presents ' titanium prints ' the ' super horse ' with its new @entity5 printed shoes			1
the researchers behind the project believe the bespoke horseshoes say could give racehorses a major advantage four customised shoes were printed within only a few hours and experts say the technology could give horses a major advantage on the track			1
traditionally made from aluminium , a horseshoe can weigh up to one kilogram but the horse ’s trainer , @entity32 , says that the ultimate race shoe should be as lightweight as possible			2
' any extra weight in the horseshoe will slow the horse down , ' he said			0
to make the shoes pictured , which are half the weight of aluminium horseshoes , the horse 's hooves were scanned and digital 3d models made			1
from these models the custom - made titanium horseshoes were printed ' these titanium shoes could take up to half of the weight off a traditional aluminium shoe , which means a horse could travel at new speeds			2
' we ’re very excited at the prospect of improved performance from these shoes			0
' the precision scanning process takes just a few minutes and for a horse , shoes can be made to measure each hoof and printed the same day			0
the project by @entity2 ’s @entity61 , @entity62 , was developed to show off a new 3d printing technique invented by the team			1
could horse races be faster in the future ? horse trainer @entity32 said the titanium shoes could take up to half of the weight off a traditional aluminium shoe , which means a horse could travel at new speeds			2
here , three horses with normal shoes race at @entity74 last month @entity75 , @entity76 at @entity62 said : ' there are so many ways we can use 3d titanium printing			2
at @entity62 we are helping companies create new applications like biomedical implants and even things like automotive and aerospace parts			0
' ' the possibilities really are endless with this technology			0
' he said that 3d printing a race horseshoe from titanium is a first for scientists and demonstrates the range of applications the technology can be used for .			0

researchers from @entity2 ’s @entity61 , @entity62 have created a ‘ super horse ’ with @entity5 printed titanium shoes
the horse , called @entity9 , had its hooves scanned and a 3d digital model was made from which the lightweight horseshoes were printed
@entity32 , the horse 's trainer , said the new shoes could give racehorses a major advantage
