the manager from @entity1 did not go far enough			0
@entity2 took the tweezers to his world champions when he should have swung an axe			1
a couple of changes from the @entity9 team ripped apart by @entity10 and a tinkering around the edges of a decaying system of play set up the beautiful game for this massively redefining moment			1
when is a gamble not worth taking ? when the poker player does n’t know the time has come to go all in			0
leaving @entity32 rooted in goal after his catastrophies against the @entity35 was as much an act of cruelty as a grotesque excess of loyalty			0
seeing him scrambling around on his knees as @entity21 scored their first , then palming a free kick down into his goalmouth to present them with a second was painfully embarrassing			1
@entity9 ’s distinguished head coach knew that his job was as much on the line as the pride of a nation , the future of several of his most beloved players and the football ethos which had changed the world game for an enchanted while			1
gutted : @entity2 's position is under threat after @entity9 failed to reach knockout stages mayhem : @entity21 fans caused chaos before the game when they stormed the media centre before being lef away by police penned in : @entity21 fans sit beside a temporary wall that was torn down before the game the cry was for drastic action			1
instead he sought a compromise between the keep - ball style which had won three major tournaments in six years and the high - speed power game with which must of the rest of the world has been overtaking @entity9			1
the issue was not only how well @entity9 would play but which way they would set about trying to rescue themselves from the humiliation of being knocked out after ony two games in defence of their title			1
@entity83 - taka or take a chance ? compromise is invariably the mother of disaster			2
despite an invasion of the @entity90 by hundreds of ticketless @entity92 fans – who broke through fences and the police cordon , stampeded through the media centre and smashed holes in walls there to break into the tunnels – the match started on time as if nothing untoward had happened			0
no hiding place : @entity104 keeper @entity32 cost his country dear blunder : @entity32 could only parry the ball away before @entity108 fired @entity21 in front in the vast bowl of the stadium itself , the only security question on 74,000 minds was whether the world champions and their manager would survive the evening			1
most prayed they would not			0
the overwhelming majority in the crowd had crossed the @entity119 to be here , not the @entity120			0
the din they created , louder even than the full house of @entity123 ’s noisy neighbours from @entity124 two days earlier , was especially sensitive to the ears of @entity2			1
he had injected pace into the midfield , i the person of @entity133			0
at the expense of @entity135 , the living legend who is his team - mate at @entity137			2
stunned : a @entity9 fan looks gobsmacked after they slipped to another defeat sinking feeling : a @entity142 supporter is close to tears as @entity21 seal their fate the elders of the @entity148 nation wept			1
into defence came power in the youthful shape of @entity152 , a tower of strength in @entity156 ’s remarkable season			0
out went @entity158 , another @entity137 veteran whose legs buckled under @entity10 ’s five - goal onslaught in @entity9 ’s first match			1
the good old boys in @entity137 put their heads in their hands			0
the manager was striving to answer the need for change without throwing out too many of the players and principles who have achieved so much			2
down and out : @entity171 struggles to hide his disappointment after @entity9 's @entity25 exit at 2 - 0 down at half time @entity2 knew more had to be done			1
@entity175 was up for another icon			0
@entity177 bowed out in favour of more energetic youth , by the one name of @entity181			0
they went back out to strive for a miracle , while being prepared to die bravely in the attempt			0
@entity185 went to join them later , displacing the deeply disappointing but still @entity187 - bound @entity188			2
but where it had been too little to begin with , now it was too late			0
it is goodbye to @entity9 and hello to whoever becomes the new world champions			2
@entity197 to tiki - taka and adios @entity199			2
it ’s been great knowing you			0
spanish inquisition : @entity9 players have it out in the tunnel after a dismal first - half showing misfiring : @entity9 managed just one goal in two group games out : a supporter struggles to accept @entity9 's @entity25 is over			1

@entity9 suffer shock exit at group stage after 2 - 0 defeat to @entity21
@entity2 could *pay* *ultimate* price for sticking by his players following 5 - 1 drubbing by @entity10
@entity9 become only the *fourth* *holders* to be knocked out in the early rounds
