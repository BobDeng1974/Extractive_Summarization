a man who helped break up an anti-gay assault at @entity2 last week found out just what it 's like to be famous when video of his heroic deed went viral			1
the only problem is that many people thought that the man in question , @entity9 , a 28 - year - old from @entity2 , @entity11 , was actually actor @entity12			1
that is until @entity12 's publicist revealed it was not the actor in the video , and someone who knows @entity9 revealed his identity to the website @entity20 , leading to what @entity9 describes as a ' pretty crazy day			1
it all began last thursday when video surfaced of a man berating a fellow traveler at the airport for wearing a pink shirt			1
then , when the anti-gay attacker was approached by someone in a cowboy hat asking what was wrong , he screamed , ' queers ! that ’s what i ’m upset about			0
this fa * * ot right here			0
' seconds later he started to kick the man in the pink shirt , while also grabbing his hair and slapping at him			1
that is when @entity9 , the man in the cowboy hat and a few other model citizens stepped in to subdue the aggressor and stop the assault			1
the whole time , a passenger named @entity76 was filming the melee , which has now been viewed close to four million times on @entity80			0
it was n't me : a publicist for @entity12 ( above ) revealed on monday that it was not the actor in the video @entity88 's sweetheart : @entity9 ( above with his fiancee ) is a 28 - year - old brand manager for dr. @entity45 good sport : said @entity9 ( above with his fiancee ) of the experience , ' it was certainly fun to be a part of for a day , and something my friends and i will look back on and laugh about for many years ' and that is when people watching the video started to wonder if @entity12 , the star of films including @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 was responsible for taking down the homophobe			1
' it seemed like every blog and website out there was running with it , ' said @entity9			2
' i have gotten the doppelgänger about [ @entity12 ] before , but nothing like today			2
it was certainly fun to be a part of for a day , and something my friends and i will look back on and laugh about for many years			0
' as for why he jumped to action , the young man said , ' i know people can get agitated at airports , but the incendiary and ignorant comments he was making were out of control			0
i was really surprised no police or security was there to separate the two , but then when it got physical my instinct was to stop and protect the victim			0
' he added , ' it was really unfortunate that people think such discriminatory things , let alone verbally and physically assault someone over it			0
i 'm glad i , along with the others who helped out , were there to help the victim and nothing worse came of it			0
' @entity12 would be proud .			2
