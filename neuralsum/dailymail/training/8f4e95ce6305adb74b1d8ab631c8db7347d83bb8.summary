@entity7 , four , was born with a giant right leg and a foot that now measures 11 inches and weighs 12lbs ( 5.4kg ) , the same as a bowling ball or sack of potatoes he has been examined by hundreds of doctors from @entity13 and abroad , who have suggested he could be suffering from conditions ranging from water retention to a hormone imbalance			1
however none have been able to recommend treatment many doctors have suggested his right leg should be amputated , but as he can run and walk normally , his father @entity33 , wants to avoid this as it would verdant for life now , his father is desperate for a doctor in some corner of the world to treat his son 's big foot so he can avoid amputation , which would disable him for the rest of his life			1
@entity7 said his foot means he is ostracised from other children , who make fun of him			1
he said : ' children laugh at me for not running fast			2
' they do n't ask me to play cricket or football , even if i tell them i can run			2
i want to go to school but teachers have told my father i ca n't go			1
' instead , @entity7 is confined to his two - room house where he plays with his mother @entity58 , 26 , and his one - year - old sister @entity59			1
his desperate parents have taken him to more than 100 doctors over the last four years but most have been baffled by his condition			2
despite examining his foot several times and taking blood , sweat and saliva samples they have failed to diagnose the problem			1
visiting doctors from @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 have even examined @entity75 but none could diagnose his condition			1
his father @entity77 , 30 , said : ' i 've tried every field of medical science , from homeopath , allopath , orthopedic specialists , bone specialists and skin specialists but to no avail			2
' @entity33 added : ' doctors from @entity71 could n't even tell us what 's wrong			2
some doctors have told us his hormones are imbalanced and others said the blood does n't flow properly and another said it 's water retention			2
but they all fail to tell us what we can do about it			0
' as @entity7 can not go to school , he has to stay at home with his father @entity33 , 30 , mother @entity98 , 26 , and his one - year - old sister @entity59 @entity7 's father @entity33 said he is ' terrified ' his son 's foot will keep growing like a balloon , and worries about what will happen in future			1
' if i had known he would be born with a deformed leg i would have aborted the baby			1
it is a punishment for any parent to helplessly watch their child suffer ' @entity115 's big foot keeps growing with age and height so it is likely his foot will continue to grow to shocking proportions			0
' i 'm terrified his foot will continue to grow and burst like a balloon , ' he added			0
@entity115 does n't feel any pain in his leg or foot and can walk , run , cross his legs and even sit on a bike without any support but many doctors have suggested amputating the leg			1
' i 've been told amputation is the only option , ' his father , mr @entity7 , said			1
' but if i cut off his foot my son would be permanently handicapped and dependent on others forever , unable to walk			2
at least he 's mobile right now			0
' mr @entity7 , who works as an astrologer earning £ 150 a month by reading horoscopes and organizing purifying rituals at birthdays and weddings , has spent £ 10,000 in four years meeting doctors			1
dr @entity142 , mbbs who runs a private clinic in @entity146 , @entity12 , believes his condition is not curable , but equally , is not life - threatening			0
' during my 35 year career i have not seen any patient like @entity75			0
his foot seems to be a genetic disease but i can not ascertain the real cause so i can not recommend any medicine or even surgery			0
but i do not believe it 's life threatening			0
' a @entity157 woman called @entity158 , 39 , from @entity159 , was born with abnormally large legs , which continued to grow to disproportionate sizes			0

' if i cut off his foot my son would be permanently handicapped and dependent on others forever , unable to walk			2
at least he 's mobile right now ' ' people get scared of him , some even ask if he has a plastic leg and then he starts crying			0
it 's very sad for him and for us to watch			0
' mrs @entity58 , who gave birth to her second child , a healthy daughter , in september 2013 , added : ' sometimes @entity115 comes to me and cries and says he has a deformed foot because he 'd committed a sin in his past life			2
' his words tear me apart			0
i do n't have any explanation for him , except keep his faith in @entity209			0
' although @entity115 does n't face any obstacles in his daily life , he has trouble finding shoes and trousers to fit			0
mr @entity7 said : ' it 's extremely difficult to find shoes that he can slip his foot into			1

' but two years ago his leg grew so big that no shoe fits			0
