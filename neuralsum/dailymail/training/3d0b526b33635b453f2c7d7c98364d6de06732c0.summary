the two have been inseparable over the past five years at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			2
when @entity12 and two other five - year old wiener dogs , @entity27 and @entity28 , sensed that the the lion was disabled they sought to comfort and protect him			1
now @entity10 and his pack of dogs cuddle , feast on raw meat and play in the grounds together			1
mr @entity24 , who works at the zoo witnessed the bond develop between the unlikely duo			2
he said : ‘ this friendship between an 11 pound wiener dog and a 500 pound lion is the only of it 's kind in the world ever seen			2
‘ @entity12 does his best to copy @entity10 when the lion tries puffing to communicate with other lions in the park			1
@entity10 who weighs 500lbs dwarfs his unlikely friend @entity12 but the lion treats the dog like one of his own cubs mr @entity24 developed his bond with big cats after striking up a friendship with seven - foot lion @entity10 , pictured @entity10 is too big to be kept in mr @entity24 's house but is kept in an enclosure at the animal park nearby @entity10 was hand - reared by mr @entity24 along with a tiger called @entity70 after he realised his ability to bring up animals			1
he added : ' they used to live with me in the house			0
i raised them both with bottled formula and raw meat until they grew too big for the house			1
' @entity81 ’s like a dog and when he has n't seen me for ages he gets all excited and runs up to me			0
' @entity70 is perfectly healthy , but is a bit too playful			0
when @entity10 senses that i am losing control of the play , he snarls at @entity70 and you can tell he is being protective and telling him to stop			1
’ now the big cats have moved into their own enclosure and he has also hand - reared another two tiger cubs called @entity91 and @entity92			1
even now that @entity10 is too big to be kept in his house , the zookeeper says he is never too far away mr @entity24 pats @entity10 on the head in his enclosure with @entity97 , a tiger he also hand reared in his home bonedigger the lion and @entity97 the tiger play with each other as mr @entity103 looks on			1
he says @entity97 is perfectly healthy but a little ' too playful ' mr @entity24 explained : ' i brought up tiger cubs named @entity106 and @entity92			0
they keep me busy and they need to be entertained every day			0
‘ @entity106 liked to play tug of war with my prosthetic legs , which is good , because i guess that would hurt otherwise ! ’ mr @entity24 admits he has always been on the wild side after an accident during a bungee jump in 1994			1
he fell through a faulty trap door from 55 feet , crushing both of his legs			0
‘ i pierced my side with a six inch metal stake too and i asked my friends to call my wife because i thought that was it , ’ said the ex-turbine engineer			2
‘ i broke my hip , my back , and shattered both feet and raked my intestines			0
needless to say , i was in a coma for eight days after i reached the hospital			0
my wife @entity130 could n’t recognise me when she first saw me			0
‘ when i finally woke up the doctors told me that i would never walk again			0
’ @entity24 feeding @entity106 the tiger cub in his home near @entity16 in @entity18 mr @entity24 holding cubs @entity106 and @entity92 with spider monkey @entity136 perched on his shoulders mr @entity24 's wife @entity138 also helps to raise the tiger cubs and gives a bottle to cub @entity106 mr @entity141 allows the animals into his own home and garden and even lets the small tigers chew on his prosthetic legs after five years of painstaking rehabilitation , @entity24 learned to use his legs again , and he began to rebuild his life			1
he and his wife @entity130 , 45 , had a second son @entity154 six years after their first son , @entity151 was born			0
but in the years that followed , @entity24 suffered from repeated infections in his legs and eventually had both amputated			0
‘ that was another low moment for me because i value my independence highly , ’ added mr @entity24			0
‘ bringing up @entity10 and @entity97 helped me recover , especially my relationship with @entity10			2
’ bringing up the cubs is a family affair as mr @entity24 's sons @entity154 and @entity151 also help out their father @entity164 poses with the @entity24 family in the back garden of their home near the animal part in @entity18 tiger cubs @entity92 and @entity106 play in the sun while their keeper mr @entity24 and his family keep a watchful eye on them			2
