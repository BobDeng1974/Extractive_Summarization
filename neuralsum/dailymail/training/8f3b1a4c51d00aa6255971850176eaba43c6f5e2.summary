to borrow a line from the song that provided the soundtrack to @entity6 ’s 2018 @entity5 bid presentation , it was looking like a beautiful day on that december morning in @entity7 four years ago			1
there was a fresh layer of snow beneath the feet of @entity12 and @entity14 mayor @entity13 as they went for a pre-dawn run beside the lake			0
having already masterminded @entity14 ’s successful bid for the @entity19 , @entity12 probably felt much like he did in the same @entity21 city where he had broken world records all those years earlier - quietly confident of victory			2
the night before , in the luxurious @entity26 hotel where all the @entity28 fat cats were staying , @entity6 ’s bid ambassadors had moved from meeting to meeting with a swagger			1
@entity30 , @entity12 and @entity31 look dejected as @entity6 miss out on hosting the 2018 @entity5 prince @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity30 look confident ahead of the @entity5 vote in 2010 @entity30 worked hard on behalf of the bid team to win support of @entity37 at one stage @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity30 appeared together at the top of the main staircase , a formidable triumvirate all seemingly content that no stone had been left unturned ahead of the vote the next day			1
even @entity37 seemed to be on board , having been skilfully seduced			2
@entity30 spoke gushingly of their good friend ‘ @entity46 ’			0
it appeared they would be getting the vote of the @entity52 chief and quite possibly those of his acolytes on the @entity28 executive committee			2
there was a sense that @entity6 had nailed it , unlike the @entity58 , their main rivals to host the 2018 tournament			2
the @entity58 ’ eve - of - vote press conference had seemed limp , apathetic even			2
‘ they ’ve thrown in the towel , ’ remarked one observer			0
either that or they did n’t need to make much of an effort			0
@entity28 president @entity66 announced @entity58 as the 2018 hosts as @entity6 's bid ceo @entity31 looks dejected by the end of the final presentations , there seemed little to suggest @entity6 were not in a strong position to follow the capture of the @entity74 by securing the right to host the greatest show of all			1
the presentation and the video , complete with that @entity81 soundtrack , was terrific , so superior to anything else on offer			0
@entity28 even rated @entity6 the best technical bid			1
and then came the vote , and the crushing sense that @entity6 had been humiliated			2
@entity6 faces turned grey in that auditorium			0
how could they have been so naive to think they had a chance ? naive to think this was a game that could be won using the tactics they had employed			0
they had won two votes , one of which belonged to their own @entity102			1
the prime minister could n’t get back to the business of running the country fast enough			0
there might have been a whiff of corruption even before the votes were cast but on thursday @entity111 ’s report claimed @entity6 may not have played strictly by the rules either			2
@entity28 vice-president @entity37 ( left ) had promised to vote for @entity6 - but reneged on his vote the @entity91 fiercely refuted this in a strongly worded statement , but @entity111 was scathing about their attempts to secure the support of the disgraced @entity37			1
@entity111 accuses @entity6 of ‘ damning the integrity of the bidding process and the image of @entity28 ’ in chasing @entity37 ’s vote			1
he reported the @entity6 bid team ‘ often accommodated mr @entity37 ’s wishes in apparent violation of bidding rules and the @entity28 code of ethics ’			1
among the alleged transgressions was the help they provided to a ‘ person of interest to him ( @entity37 ) ’ in finding ‘ a part - time job in the @entity134 ’			2
@entity6 were also said to have provided ‘ substantial assistance ’ in setting up an @entity136 training camp for the @entity137 in the @entity134 in response to @entity37 ’s ‘ improper demands ’			1
the truth is , the @entity6 bid team were reluctant amateurs in a highly professional game , and if they were taken to the cleaners in @entity7 they were tucked up again by @entity28 yesterday			1
@entity58 's deputy prime minister @entity145 and @entity146 of the @entity58 2018 bid celebrate winning pursuing @entity37 in quite the manner they did was a mistake			1
it felt unpalatable at the time and the @entity91 were left looking all the more uncomfortable when @entity37 was eventually exposed and bounced out of football for good			0
everyone knew , even then , that @entity37 was corrupt , and the @entity91 were foolish to associate with him			0
to think prince @entity32 and the prime minister listened to @entity37 promising his support , only for him to then renege on his vote			2
@entity37 made mugs of them			0
the fact that public money — more than 10 per cent of the £ 21million spent on @entity6 ’s bid — went towards trying to get @entity37 onside is a further source of embarrassment			1
@entity111 ( right , with @entity166 left ) was critical of @entity6 's bid in his report @entity168 cleared for @entity5 as @entity28 findings revealed the @entity91 were essentially punished for being more transparent than anyone else			1
the @entity58 ‘ lost ’ their emails			0
the @entity172 just would n’t co-operate			0
and @entity173 ? well , it ’s just not easy to prove corruption , claimed the report			0
it is amazing that @entity111 attacks @entity6 for a £ 35,000 sponsorship but goes much easier on @entity173 for a similar one that cost them £ 1.15million			0
it was , as @entity182 mp said quite rightly , a whitewash , a joke , and one that became all the more ridiculous once investigator @entity166 appealed to overturn @entity111 ’s summary of his report			0
@entity173 's sheik @entity187 poses with the famous @entity5 trophy even by @entity28 standards , that was a game changer , a day when the world governing body descended into chaos			1
while the credibility of @entity28 has never been under greater scrutiny , the @entity91 do not come out of this unscathed			0
@entity31 and his bid team might have felt it necessary to court men such as @entity37 , but in doing so some of the most prominent people in the country were dragged into a tawdry affair and today it looks all the more embarrassing : an error of judgment .			1

@entity6 's team believed they had done everything to win the @entity5 bid
@entity6 won just two votes - one coming from their own @entity102
@entity28 criticised @entity6 for chasing the vote of vice-president @entity37
