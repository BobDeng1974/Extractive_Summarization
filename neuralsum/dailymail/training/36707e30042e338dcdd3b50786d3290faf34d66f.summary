by @entity0 in a country that has always been subject to changeable weather conditions , you might have thought our public transport would , by now , be accustomed to it			0
but whether it is too warm , too cold or too wet , transport in the @entity8 still often struggles to cope			0
this was proven yesterday when all trams in @entity12 were cancelled due to frost on the lines			1
services were suspended because of frost on the rails but were resumed by 8am , albeit with persistent delays all early morning tram services were forced to stop and replacement bus services put in their place because ‘ ice had built up on overhead lines ’			1
@entity25 ( @entity25 ) said the trams could not run because they could not pick up power properly on the first night that temperatures had gone to @entity29 for the first time this year			1
trams get their power from electric lines suspended above their route			1
they are connected to the wires at all times by a mechanism which stretches from their roof and collects the electricity			0
because of the layer of frost on the wires , the connection between wire and tram was broken and the vehicles were unable to collect enough electricity to power their engines			2
trams were reintroduced just before 8am but there were still delays to services until late morning			1
@entity54 posted on @entity55 saying it was ‘ unbelievable ’ for the service to fail due to the ‘ first proper frost ’			0
@entity59 said : ‘ so like the too many leaves on railway lines , our wonderful trams can not operate in the winter when the temperature drops to freezing ? ’ indeed , it is not just cold weather that has been known to cause travel disruption in the @entity8			2
in @entity70 - months trains have been known to be severely delayed due simply to ‘ leaves on the line ’			0
and in the summer , warm weather has been blamed by operators who have cancelled services due to the wrong type of soil			1
in 2011 , @entity78 cancelled @entity80 services between @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 because dry soil has caused the rails to shift			2
in the same year , @entity87 scrapped its service from @entity89 , @entity90 to @entity91 because the train is too big for the platform			2
this followed the decision of the company to add a seventh carriage to the service to ease overcrowding , not realising it would be too big for @entity89 station			0
also in 2011 , travellers hoping to alight at @entity103 in @entity104 were unable to reach their destination after @entity106 received a call from a woman who thought she saw a lion .			0

services were cancelled because trams could not pick up power
@entity115 struck as temperatures fell to @entity29 for first night this year
trams were running again by 8am but with delays all morning
