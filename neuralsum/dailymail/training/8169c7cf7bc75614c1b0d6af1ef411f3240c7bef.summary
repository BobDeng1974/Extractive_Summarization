@entity0 died of a therapeutic complication as a result of throat surgery			1
the @entity5 office of chief medical examiner released the results of their investigation into the comedian 's death today , saying that she died due to brain damage as a result of a lack of oxygen , which they call ' a predictable complication of medical therapy , ' meaning her death is the result of a risk that is associated with her surgery			1
rivers died in @entity5 on september 4 at the age of 81 following a minor throat procedure at @entity26			1
' hypoxic arrest is caused by a drastic reduction in oxygen supply to the brain			2
that then leads to anoxic encephalopathy , which is brain damage due to lack of oxygen			2
the laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy refer to the diagnostic procedure @entity55 was having performed at the time			2
@entity57 , the drug rivers was on while her operation was being performed , is used to induce or maintain anesthesia during surgery and is the same drug that caused the death of @entity64 when he overdosed on it back in 2009			1
and lastly , gastroesophageal reflux disease is why @entity55 was having the surgery performed			2
dr @entity67 , @entity55 ' throat specialist , was one of the doctors in the room when the incident occurred			0
on the scene : @entity55 ' throat specialist , dr. @entity67 ( above ) , was with the star when her surgery went wrong rivers was having throat surgery at @entity26 when complications occurred the report means that @entity55 died when she stopped getting oxygen to her brain , said @entity83 gastroenterologist dr. @entity82 , past president of the @entity84			1
' that may have happened from a heart attack , or a stroke , or too much sedation , ' said @entity82 , who has spoken with physicians from the @entity91 facility			0
@entity82 said speculation among @entity5 physicians is that @entity55 had a vocal cord lesion that was being biopsied when she had some sort of vocal cord spasm			1
' no one really knows what happened , but the scuttlebutt is that she had a biopsy of a vocal cord lesion			0
that ’s what it sounds like , that an @entity106 was there , took a biopsy for the lesion , and we do n’t know what the connection is between that and her going off to the hospital is			0
there ’s a big disconnect there – what happened between the biopsy , we do n’t even know if she had the rest of the endoscopy – and the loss of oxygen to the brain ? ' @entity82 said such complications are uncommon			0
' these are very , very rare complications , ' @entity82 said			0
' there are millions of endoscopic investigations done every day under propofol , and yet so infrequently do we see a situation like this			0
' he added , ' it ’s unusual we just never see spasms of the vocal cords that would cause someone to have an anoxic encephalopathy			0
' rivers was rushed to the @entity141 on august 28 after she stopped breathing as a result of serious complications during a routine throat procedure			1
she was put into a medically induced coma and then , two days later , placed on life support			0
four days after that she passed away .			1
