@entity3 ( pictured on monday ) stormed out of his grievance hearing on wednesday after arbitrator @entity13 refused to order baseball commissioner @entity14 to testify ' i am disgusted with this abusive process , designed to ensure that the player fails , ' @entity3 said in a statement afterwards			1
' i have sat through 10 days of testimony by felons and liars , sitting quietly through every minute , trying to respect the league and the process			0

this negotiated process has served players and clubs well			0
' despite mr. @entity3 being upset with one of the arbitration panel 's rulings today , @entity9 remains committed to this process and to a fair resolution of the pending dispute			1
' there is one line of thinking that the walkout may have been calculated to give @entity3 ’s team the alibi it needs to explain why he wo n’t take the witness stand in his own defense and go under oath about his relationship with @entity52 and @entity52 , reports @entity81			1

@entity117 worked on @entity3 's behalf earlier this year			1
