@entity0 promoting @entity2 clothes with @entity3 during the @entity6 's @entity5 campaign fresh demands to curb the salaries of fat cat charity bosses were made yesterday after it emerged that @entity11 is paying its top employee £ 234,000 a year			1
the individual , believed to be chief executive @entity0 , is among 20 employees earning more than £ 100,000 at the charity ’s international body			1
another nine are on six - figure salaries at the charity ’s @entity6 arm			1
former city executive miss @entity0 recently starred alongside actress dame @entity3 and artist @entity22 in @entity2 ’s ‘ @entity6 ’s leading ladies ’ fashion advert campaign			1
that huge pay packet is considerably more than the £ 142,500 a year paid to @entity26 , whose wife @entity27 is an ambassador for @entity11			2
but it is surpassed by the salary of the highest paid employee at @entity31 , who earns more than £ 290,000 a year			1
a second employee at the birth control charity is paid more than £ 200,000 and in total 11 people are on six - figure salaries			1
charities are not required to detail by name how much their top executives are paid , and many express the sums in bands , disguising the true figures			2
neither @entity11 , which boasts of being ‘ committed to being fully transparent to children , our donors , supporters and the public at large ’ , nor @entity49 will reveal the identities of their high - earners			1
mps condemned both the pay rates and the secrecy			1
@entity56 , a member of the @entity57 public administration select committee , said : ‘ taxpayers and individual donors who bankroll these charities will be shocked to see the size of these colossal fat cat salaries			0
‘ they deserve to know how decisions are made about salaries and who is paid them			2
the culture of secrecy that exists in some charities must come to an end			0
’ @entity71 mp said : ‘ think charity and you think volunteers rattling their collecting tins , vocation , compassion			0
you do n’t think mega-salaries			0
it ’s unacceptable and it has got to change			0
charities should be open and transparent			0
’ @entity82 erupted last year after an investigation into @entity6 ’s 14 leading foreign aid charities , which make up the @entity85 and receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers , revealed spiralling pay rates			1
@entity26 who earns £ 142,500 a year and his wife @entity27 - who is an ambassador for @entity11 the number of executives receiving six - figure salaries had risen by nearly 60 per cent , from 19 to 30 , between 2010 and 2012 , despite a fall in donations and revenue at many of the organisations			1
among those identified was @entity98 , a former @entity99 adviser on £ 163,000 a year as chief executive of @entity11 – much less than miss @entity0 ’s assumed salary as chief executive of the charity ’s umbrella body , @entity105			2
@entity105 refused to discuss its executives ’ pay rates or identify the highest - paid employee – who , according to the charity ’s 2012 accounts , received $ 386,893 , a drop from $ 393,012 for the previous year			1
all questions were referred to the charity ’s 2012 annual report and accounts – which do not identify individuals against salary bands			0
miss @entity0 , 50 , a glamorous mother of two who lives in @entity119 , became the first international chief executive of @entity11 in 2010 , after heading @entity11 since 2005			2
she used to be a high - flying executive for information giant @entity122 in the @entity123			2
in 2008 she said she did not do her charity job for the money			0
‘ my salary ( £ 128,000 in 2007 ) is less than my bonus was at @entity122 , ’ she said			0
according to its most recent accounts , @entity31 ’s highest paid employee received between £ 290,001 and £ 300,000 in 2012			1
@entity123 @entity130 was its chief executive from 2007 until may 2013 , when he left to join the @entity131			0
the charity said : ‘ as a global social enterprise , we establish remuneration to attract the best talent from the global market			0
as part of our commitment to transparency , we publish list remuneration figures			0
‘ out of respect for team members ’ privacy we do not list individual salaries by name or position			0

high earner , thought to be @entity0 , among 20 earning over £ 100k
another nine on six - figure salaries at charity 's @entity6 arm
surpassed by highest paid employee at @entity49 - who earns £ 290k
