scientists have revealed a huge breakthrough in the search for life on other planets			1
@entity7 's @entity6 spacecraft has provided scientists the first clear evidence that @entity11 's moon @entity9 exhibits signs of present - day hydrothermal activity - similar to that seen in the deep oceans on @entity16			1
if confirmed , it would make the @entity19 the only other known body in the solar system besides @entity16 where hot water and rocks interact underground			2
hydrothermal activity occurs when seawater infiltrates and reacts with a rocky crust and emerges as a heated , mineral - laden solution , a natural occurrence in @entity16 's oceans			1
according to two science papers , the results are the first clear indications an icy moon may have similar ongoing active processes			1
@entity6 team member @entity34 of the @entity35 in @entity36 used spacecraft observations and computer modeling to show that the plume is connected to what 's happening on the lunar sea floor			1
judging by their size and makeup , the team believes particles in the plume are the result of hot water coming into contact with rocks on the ocean floor			1
the resulting mineral - rich water then shoots up through the icy crust and erupts into space in a plume of gas and ice			0
some particles settle around @entity11 , replenishing its biggest ring			1
that activity would make the moon an even more attractive place in the hunt for microbial life			1
on @entity16 , scientists have found weird life forms living in hydrothermal vents on the ocean bottom where there 's no sunlight			1
the implications of such activity on a world other than our planet open up unprecedented scientific possibilities , @entity7 said			0
' these findings add to the possibility that @entity9 , which contains a subsurface ocean and displays remarkable geologic activity , could contain environments suitable for living organisms , ' said @entity85 astronaut and associate administrator of @entity7 's @entity87 in @entity88			1
' the locations in our solar system where extreme environments occur in which life might exist may bring us closer to answering the question : are we alone in the @entity96			1
' hydrothermal activity occurs when seawater infiltrates and reacts with a rocky crust and emerges as a heated , mineral - laden solution , a natural occurrence in @entity16 's oceans			1
according to two science papers , the results are the first clear indications an icy moon may have similar ongoing active processes			1
the first paper , published this week in the journal nature , relates to microscopic grains of rock detected by @entity6 in the @entity11 system			1
an extensive , four - year analysis of data from the spacecraft , computer simulations and laboratory experiments led researchers to the conclusion the tiny grains most likely form when hot water containing dissolved minerals from the moon 's rocky interior travels upward , coming into contact with cooler water			1
temperatures required for the interactions that produce the tiny rock grains would be at least 194 degrees @entity131 ( 90 degrees @entity132 )			0
' it 's very exciting that we can use these tiny grains of rock , spewed into space by geysers , to tell us about conditions on -- and beneath -- the ocean floor of an icy moon , ' said the paper 's lead author @entity34 , a postdoctoral researcher at the @entity35			2
@entity6 's cosmic dust analyzer ( @entity145 ) instrument repeatedly detected miniscule rock particles rich in silicon , even before @entity6 entered @entity11 's orbit in 2004			1
by process of elimination , the @entity145 team concluded these particles must be grains of silica , which is found in sand and the mineral quartz on @entity16			2
the consistent size of the grains observed by @entity6 , the largest of which were 6 to 9 nanometers , was the clue that told the researchers a specific process likely was responsible			0
on @entity16 , the most common way to form silica grains of this size is hydrothermal activity under a specific range of conditions ; namely , when slightly alkaline and salty water that is super-saturated with silica undergoes a big drop in temperature			0
this illustration depicts potential origins of methane found in the plume of gas and ice particles that sprays from @entity19 , based on research by scientists working with the @entity181 and @entity182			0
' we methodically searched for alternate explanations for the nanosilica grains , but every new result pointed to a single , most likely origin , ' said co-author @entity188 , a @entity145 team scientist at @entity189 in @entity190			2
@entity34 and @entity188 worked closely with colleagues at the @entity192 who performed the detailed laboratory experiments that validated the hydrothermal activity hypothesis			0
the @entity197 team , led by @entity198 , verified the conditions under which silica grains form at the same size @entity6 detected			2
the researchers think these conditions may exist on the seafloor of @entity19 , where hot water from the interior meets the relatively cold water at the ocean bottom			0
the extremely small size of the silica particles also suggests they travel upward relatively quickly from their hydrothermal origin to the near - surface sources of the moon 's geysers			2
from seafloor to outer space , a distance of about 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) , the grains spend a few months to a few years in transit , otherwise they would grow much larger			1
the authors point out that @entity6 's gravity measurements suggest @entity9 ' rocky core is quite porous , which would allow water from the ocean to percolate into the interior			0
this would provide a huge surface area where rock and water could interact			0
the second paper , recently published in @entity230 , suggests hydrothermal activity as one of two likely sources of methane in the plume of gas and ice particles that erupts from the south polar region of @entity19			0
the finding is the result of extensive modeling to address why methane , as previously sampled by @entity6 , is curiously abundant in the plume			0
the team found that , at the high pressures expected in the moon 's ocean , icy materials called clathrates could form that imprison methane molecules within a crystal structure of water ice			1
their models indicate that this process is so efficient at depleting the ocean of methane that the researchers still needed an explanation for its abundance in the plume			0
this june 28 , 2009 image provided by @entity7 , taken by the international @entity6 spacecraft , shows @entity9 , one of @entity264 s moons			0
a new study published online wednesday , march 11 , 2015 , in the journal nature , suggests there are ongoing interactions between hot water and rocks beneath the surface of the icy moon			2
in one scenario , hydrothermal processes super-saturate the ocean with methane			0
this could occur if methane is produced faster than it is converted into clathrates			0
a second possibility is that methane clathrates from the ocean are dragged along into the erupting plumes and release their methane as they rise , like bubbles forming in a popped bottle of champagne			0
the authors agree both scenarios are likely occurring to some degree , but they note that the presence of nanosilica grains , as documented by the other paper , favors the hydrothermal scenario			0
' we did n't expect that our study of clathrates in the @entity19 ocean would lead us to the idea that methane is actively being produced by hydrothermal processes , ' said lead author @entity303 , a graduate student at the @entity304 at @entity305			0
@entity303 worked with co-author @entity306 , who leads the @entity181 and @entity182 ( @entity308 ) team at @entity309 in @entity305			2
@entity6 first revealed active geological processes on @entity19 in 2005 with evidence of an icy spray issuing from the moon 's south polar region and higher - than - expected temperatures in the icy surface there			2
with its powerful suite of complementary science instruments , the mission soon revealed a towering plume of water ice and vapor , salts and organic materials that issues from relatively warm fractures on the wrinkled surface			0
gravity science results published in 2014 strongly suggested the presence of a 6 - mile - ( 10 - kilometer - ) deep ocean beneath an ice shell about 19 to 25 miles ( 30 to 40 kilometers ) thick .			1

experts describe ' remarkable ' discovery on @entity11 moon
believe the moon could still have life in vast undersea oceans
@entity340 is deeper than previous estimates *—* more than 30 miles deep
*cassini* team last year said it could be bigger than @entity344
