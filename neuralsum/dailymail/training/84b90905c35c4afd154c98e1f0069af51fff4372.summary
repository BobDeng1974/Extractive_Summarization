by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 23:58 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 04:38 est , 5 december 2012 almost £ 2billion of @entity6 taxpayers ' money is to be used to pay for climate change projects overseas including wind turbines in @entity9 and greener cattle farming in @entity11 , a @entity3 minister has claimed			1
last night senior conservatives condemned the size of the bill - equivalent to £ 70 for every household - with former chancellor @entity16 of @entity17 attacking the ' appalling waste of money '			1
but @entity20 , the deputy prime minister , hailed the cash as ' fantastic news '			0
today the row threatened to overshadow a separate move by @entity25 to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from planned increases in @entity6 ’s foreign aid budget following complaints from conservative mps that it is too lavish			1
energy secretary @entity31 announced each household will contribute an average of £ 70 towards schemes to tackle climate change in the third world before march 2015 the chancellor is able to scale back the budget and still meet the government ’s controversial target to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of gdp by 2014 , @entity38 sources told the @entity45			1
the move is designed to cheer conservatives opposed to @entity49 's pledge to increase foreign aid budgets at a time when the rest of @entity38 is tightening its belt			1
but instead @entity54 are dismayed at the timing of the @entity3 announcement to commit up to £ 2billion to helping third world countries deal with climate change			2
the money is coming from the existing budget of @entity61			1
mr @entity31 made the announcement as he arrived at @entity63 climate change talks in @entity64 , @entity65 , making @entity6 the first @entity67 country to make such a pledge			0
but the row threatened to overshadow a separate move by @entity25 to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from planned increases in @entity6 ’s foreign aid budget following complaints from conservative mps that it is too lavish			1
at a party at the @entity78 , ministers gave details of £ 150 million in new projects as part of @entity6 's £ 1.8billion in ' climate aid ' for poorer countries within three years			1
mr @entity31 said the money should be spent because ' climate change is a global threat and with every passing year , the nature and the extent of that threat grows clearer '			2
' we also recognise that the world 's poorest will be hit the hardest by the impacts of climate change , and we need to help communities adapt to these challenges , ' he said			0
the @entity6 's package of support includes almost £ 100million to help to subsidise renewable energy in @entity9 , such as electricity produced from wind and solar farms			2
@entity101 , @entity102 mp for @entity103 , said the spending was ' an absolutely classic example of waste ' around £ 15million will go to help cattle farmers practise ' low carbon agriculture ' in @entity11 and £ 14million will help build wind farms and other renewables in @entity111			2
@entity101 , conservative mp for @entity103 , said the spending was ' an absolutely classic example of waste ' that should be stopped at a time of austerity			0
' all i can say is a fool and his money are soon parted , ' he said			0
' but it 's the @entity6 taxpayer having to pay for this absurd expenditure			0
we know wind farms are all but useless and nobody wants them in @entity125 , let alone @entity9			0
' @entity126 , a @entity102 mp for @entity127 , also criticised the level of climate aid spending			0
' this ca n't be the priority for spending when the @entity133 government is trying to create jobs and reduce the cost of living , ' he said			0
' it seems difficult to understand how we can justify this when energy is a huge cost for so many of our households and businesses			0
' @entity143 , conservative mp for @entity144 , said he thought the spending was ' absolutely crazy ' at a time when public services were being cut			0
but @entity148 , a climate change adviser for @entity150 , said : ' at last , a developed country has finally made a pledge for future climate finance here in @entity64			0
the @entity6 has taken a step forward			0
' the international aid budget has been protected from cuts , after all three parties agreed to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of gdp by 2014			1
ironically , the target can now be hit with less money because of lower than expected economic growth			0
the @entity133 ’s decision to increase aid spending by to more than £ 12 billion at a time of austerity at home has divided opinion , with significant numbers of @entity102 backbenchers arguing the budget is riddled with corruption and waste			1
mr @entity49 has argued that leading the world boosts @entity6 ’s standing on the world stage , as well as limiting immigration and terror threats that might otherwise emerge from developing nations			0
however , the new international development secretary @entity181 , a former accountant , has adopted a more sceptical approach than her predecessor @entity183			0
last month , in what was seen as @entity185 of @entity6 sending billions of pounds in foreign aid to better - off countries , she announced that a controversial £ 280 million - a - year aid programme to @entity189 is to be brought to an end			1
international development secretary @entity181 , a former accountant , has taken a tougher approach to foreign aid spending @entity102 mps had pointed out that @entity189 ’s economy is growing at the rate of eight per cent a year , meaning it is now able to spend vast sums on defence and has its own space programme			1
@entity189 now even has its own overseas aid programme , worth £ 328 million a year			2
but under @entity201 , @entity189 became the biggest net recipient of @entity6 aid , receiving £ 421 million in 2010			2
despite @entity189 ’s rapid economic development , mr @entity183 decided to approve a further £ 1.1 billion in aid over the following four years			2
last week , miss @entity181 also suspended a £ 21 million aid payment to @entity206 following warnings that its government was arming a rebellion in the @entity211			2
sources said mr @entity25 remained committed to hitting the target to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of gdp by 2014			1
but slower than expected economic growth means the big planned increases in the aid budget are now due to ‘ overshoot ’ the target - a situation which the chancellor believes can not be justified at a time of cutbacks at home			1
over the next two years , the aid budget is expected to be reined in by almost £ 1 billion as a result .			1
