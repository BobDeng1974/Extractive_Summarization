by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 03:39 est , 5 march 2013 sir @entity2 's fears were confirmed when @entity3 was ruled out of @entity6 's @entity5 clash with @entity7			1
the @entity9 defender , 21 , had been a major doubt for the second leg since damaging ligaments in his right ankle in the @entity15 victory over @entity16 two weeks ago			1
he missed training on monday morning and @entity2 confirmed his absence shortly after the session			1
' he 's not fit			0
he wo n't be fit for tomorrow , ' said the @entity20			0
@entity2 , who was joined by sir @entity44 at the training session , gave @entity3 every chance to be fit in time , but he had not even started light training until the end of last week after the club ’s medical staff estimated a three - week lay - off			1
meanwhile , @entity22 will play a part in what will be the 1,000th game of his career			2
there also appears to be a slight concern over @entity58 , who trained away from the rest of the first - team squad this morning , doing some light running on an adjoining pitch			1
drill bits : @entity6 players warm up during training at the club 's @entity66 watching brief : @entity58 sits out @entity6 's training session on monday morning blow : @entity3 has missed @entity6 's last two games since sustaining an injury against @entity16 struggling off : united medics help @entity3 from during the @entity15 fifth round clash with @entity16 at @entity74 but @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , who all picked up knocks in saturday ’s 4 - 0 win over @entity80 , trained without any problems			1
a huge media presence this morning was a reminder of the magnitude of this fixture , with @entity87 press and television crews turning up in numbers before heading over to @entity91 ’s @entity90 , where @entity7 will train this afternoon			1
two members of the @entity94 family , @entity93 and @entity95 , even watched the players go through their paces from a balcony overlooking the pitch			2
keeping watch : sir @entity44 joins sir @entity2 ( left ) at monday morning 's session , which was watched by club directors @entity94 ( second from right ) and brother @entity105 ( far right ) at @entity66 getting stuck in : @entity75 ( no 20 ) trains despite picking up a knock against @entity80 as @entity108 ( no 10 ) looks on tuesday 's @entity5 clash between @entity6 and @entity110 is the match of the season so far			1
@entity113 will have news and pictures of all the build - up as it happens : they were greeted by freezing conditions as the @entity6 squad , many wearing hats and gloves , formed two circles and played keep - ball with two players in the middle trying to win it back			1
captain @entity127 , unlikely to play if @entity58 is fit , found himself in the middle more than most			2
afterwards fitness coach @entity128 oversaw some quickstep exercises over small hurdles as the intensity increased			0
overall , the mood seemed relaxed and even jovial at times with @entity2 – wrapped up against the cold in a grey anorak and hat – looking on			2
the @entity6 boss is set to appear at his pre-match press conference alongside @entity22 at @entity74 on monday afternoon as the build - up to the big game continues			2
@entity22 @entity108 @entity25 wizard of the dribble : @entity127 ( centre ) takes on @entity108 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) @entity6 midfielder @entity144 acknowledges nights like this are the ones that really get his competitive juices flowing			0
after almost seven years at @entity74 - during which time he has gained four @entity151 title - winning medals , won one @entity5 and played in two other finals - @entity144 has enough experience not to be overwhelmed by the biggest of occasions			2
but he accepts certain matches are beyond the norm			0
' these are the nights you live for , ' he said			0
' it is extra special			0
there is just something in the air			0
everyone comes to the stadium with a spring in their step			0
raring to go : @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 ( right ) trained despite picking up knocks against @entity80 on saturday talking a good game : @entity6 's midfielder @entity144 trains today ahead of the @entity7 clash ' every supporter is that little bit more vocal			1
they appreciate how important it is and what it means to get through			0
' the prestige and history of the club suggests we should be challenging in the later stages of these tournaments			0
' it is up to us to go out there and do it			0
' @entity187 ' presence in the 24 - man @entity7 squad that flew into @entity190 on sunday night underlines the importance being placed on the game by @entity7 boss @entity193 given the vastly experienced goalkeeper has been missing since january , when he fractured his hand against @entity196 , and only returned to training on thursday .			1

ankle injury prevents 21 - year - old from facing @entity87 *giants*
@entity58 trains away from first - team squad
but @entity205 , @entity76 and @entity77 all take part in full training
sir @entity44 joins @entity2 as players are put through paces
and the @entity212 are at @entity66 , too
