bad designs and unchecked contractors contributed to failing batteries in @entity5 's @entity4 that led to one catching on fire at @entity8 's @entity7 in 2013 , safety officials determined			1
the @entity9 released a report monday that found the plane 's battery had a faulty design that neither @entity5 nor the @entity14 stepped in to fix			1
' the investigation identified deficiencies in the design and certification processes that should have prevented an outcome like this , ' said acting @entity9 chairperson @entity21 in a statement			2
' @entity32 breaks down the two batteries aboard the 787 , a main battery that powers maintenance systems and provides backup power to control systems , and a rear battery that can start an auxiliary engine used for ground power and backup power in flight			2
according to the @entity9 investigation , the rear batteries became overheated shortly before the @entity8 fire , leading to a ' thermal runaway , ' in which a chemical reaction was triggered that released heat and caused the batteries to catch fire			1
the fire , which happened back in january 2013 , happened aboard a 787 that had just arrived from @entity54 to @entity8 's @entity7			1
the plane was empty at the time			0
after the fire , the @entity14 grounded the entire fleet of @entity4 while the incident was investigated			1
the @entity9 study cited internal short circuiting and poor ' thermal management ' in the large lithium - ion batteries as leading to the runaway			0
inspection : @entity9 materials engineer @entity64 looks over the battery that was on board the plane that caught fire in @entity8 in 2013 another issue was one of accountability during the design process , exacerbated by the complex chain between manufacturer , contractor and subcontractor working on the battery			1
the batteries themselves were manufactured by @entity79			0
the @entity81 corporation had been contracted by @entity83 aerospace technology firm @entity82 , which was working for @entity5			0
according to the report , @entity82 changed certain plans without consulting @entity5 , plans which @entity79 then deviated from			0
according to the @entity9 probe , neither the @entity14 or @entity5 audited the battery maker , allowing @entity82 to perform its own investigations , which found no problems related to battery or cell manufacturing			1
after the fire , the @entity14 and @entity5 did audit @entity79 's work , and what they found did not inspire confidence			1
their technicians were n't following instructions for building or installing battery components and there was ' no traceability [ of components ] to assembly drawing and instructions , ' the report read			2
the ' non-compliance items at @entity82 involved adherence to contractual requirements for @entity5 's approval on drawing or procedural changes , ' the @entity9 investigation found			2
battery problems only compound issues with the 787 , with cracks in wings of aircraft still being manufactured discovered more recently			0
in a statement to @entity5 said : ' we have reviewed the @entity9 's report and appreciate the hard work of the @entity9 and all other investigation parties , which has advanced the understanding of this incident			2
we concur with the report 's probable cause finding â€“ a short circuit within one battery cell led to venting and cell - to - cell propagation that caused the battery failure			0
' we remain confident in the comprehensive improvements made to the 787 battery system following this event , and in the overall performance of the battery system and the safety of the airplane			0
we continue to work reliability improvements on the 787 and will do so throughout the span of the program			0

an investigation by the @entity9 found batteries aboard the planes were poorly designed
a subcontractor was found to have poorly followed instructions for building battery components and was not properly instructed by a @entity5 contractor
neither the @entity14 nor @entity5 audited the battery manufacturing process before the incident
in january 2013 , a @entity4 just arrived from @entity54 caught fire in @entity8
the @entity14 ordered all 787s grounded so an investigation could be conducted
