president @entity0 brought the infamous shooting of @entity2 , a @entity3 , @entity4 teen , into his speech to the @entity6 on wednesday , citing it as evidence that the @entity8 has ' our own racial and ethnic tensions ' that compare to the sectarian genocide and ethnic cleansing plaguing the @entity14			1
' his remarks focused mostly on armed clashes in @entity17 and on a vicious jihad in @entity19 and @entity20 where a terror group has beheaded journalists for a global @entity24 audience , where hundreds of thousands have died , and where millions have fled as refugees			1
' i realize that @entity8 's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals ; that @entity8 has plenty of problems within our own borders , ' he told representatives of 193 countries gathered in @entity39			1
' ' we have our own racial and ethnic tensions ' : @entity0 brought the august shooting in @entity3 , @entity4 into his speech condemning @entity45 terrorists for a genocidal march across parts of @entity20 and @entity19 wild : the murderous @entity49 terror group @entity45 has mass - slaughtered fellow @entity50 for the crime of belonging to the wrong religious sect @entity53 : @entity2 's police - shooting death followed his participation in a convenience - story robbery , but civil rights protesters descended on the town of @entity3 , @entity4 to demand the cop 's prosecution ' in a summer marked by instability in the @entity14 and @entity64 , i know the world also took notice of the small @entity8 city of @entity3 , @entity4 – where a young man was killed , and a community was divided			1
so yes , we have our own racial and ethnic tensions			1
' @entity2 , a black teen who had just committed a strong - arm robbery , was shot multiple times and killed on august 9 by a white police officer , following a physical altercation			1
the case brought @entity8 racial animus out from its periodic hibernation			1
agitators from as far away as @entity78 and @entity79 descended on the @entity81 suburb for marches , looting and more than a week of nightly riots			0
attorney general @entity84 personally visited @entity3 and hinted that the federal government could pursue a criminal case against the officer under federal civil rights laws , even if a @entity89 decides no to indict him			0
reaction to @entity0 's inclusion of the @entity3 episode in a speech about global terrorism and military invasions was swift but mostly confined to social media			2
online critics complained that a moral equivalence between @entity3 and @entity99 is unfair because – among many reasons – it allows dictators and terror ringleaders to dismiss their mass killings as comparable to a police action gone awry			0
' it suggests they are morally equal , ' former longtime @entity107 spokesman @entity106 tweeted			0
the worst of it : looters descended on a convenience store during the riots that followed the @entity2 shooting in august ; no one was killed reaction online was immediate and overwhelmingly opposed to comparing @entity4 with @entity20 or @entity19 a former spokesman for the @entity8 mission to the @entity6 vented his disgust on @entity120 @entity124 chief @entity122 correspondent @entity121 , however , had words of praise			1
the @entity3 reference , he tweeted , was ' @entity0 at his best – a view of @entity8 exceptionalism that demands work , politics [ and ] change to make [ the ] country better			2
' few on @entity134 were willing to engage on the subject on wednesday			0
spokespersons for eight members of @entity138 , including four @entity139 and three @entity141 members of the @entity142 , declined to comment on the record			0
only one @entity122 @entity139 official , who insisted on anonymity , was willing to speak to @entity145			0
he said the president was ' tone deaf to the @entity149 power ' for suggesting ' the @entity8 's race squabbles are in the same universe as the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in the @entity14			2
' ' if it were n't so outrageous , ' he said , ' it would be outright hilarious			0
' this @entity124 correspondent swam against the current , insisting that @entity0 made a smart move moral equivalency ? one congressional staffer said ' if it were n't so outrageous , it would be outright hilarious ' the others chose not to weigh in despite the language in which @entity0 couched his comparison of a lone policeman 's controversial decision with the systematic execution of countless @entity50 by other @entity50			2
' we welcome the scrutiny of the world , he insisted , ' because what you see in @entity8 is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems and make our union more perfect			0
' @entity8 is not the same as it was 100 years ago , 50 years ago , or even a decade ago , ' @entity0 insisted , because the @entity8 carves out ' a place for people of every race and religion			2

@entity8 president spoke to the @entity6 on wednesday , *castigating* the @entity45 terror group 's ' *network* of death '
amid mentions of the @entity189 - @entity17 crisis and @entity191 's *nuclear* *program* , @entity0 seemed to *apologize* for a racially *fraught* shooting in @entity4
a white police officer shot and killed a black teen on august 9 in a case that brought protesters out of the *woodwork* and *sparked* a @entity200 *inquest*
no charges have been brought against the police officer for killing @entity2 , who had just come from committing a robbery but was *unarmed*
@entity0 told the @entity6 that ' @entity8 has plenty of problems within our own borders ' and ' our own racial and ethnic tensions '
