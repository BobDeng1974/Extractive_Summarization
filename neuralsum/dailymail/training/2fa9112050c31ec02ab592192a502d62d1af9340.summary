a billion - dollar class - action lawsuit against @entity1 is expected to continue after a 65 - year - old @entity3 business consultant read about the plaintiffs ' floundering case online and volunteered to represent consumers in the suit			1
a federal judge said she was tentatively satisfied with a proposal to add @entity10 the new named plaintiff in the lawsuit over @entity1 's @entity14 software and the price of its ipods			2
the case actually started with three plaintiffs suing @entity1 nearly 10 years ago , but two of them withdrew and the judge disqualified the last one , @entity21 , on monday amid indications that @entity21 did n't herself purchase any of the affected ipods during the time frame covered by the suit			2

earlier this week , lawyers claimed it had deliberately deleted rivals ' song from @entity16 from 2007 to 2009			1
but , the tech giant has challenged the suit after presenting evidence suggesting the plaintiffs ' models of @entity16 may be invalid @entity1 is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market , and only earlier this week lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals ' song from @entity16			1
the case went to trial in @entity48 this month , after being filed a decade ago			1
plaintiffs are claiming that @entity1 's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed @entity1 to sell ipods at inflated prices			0
they are seeking $ 350 million ( £ 224m ) in damages , which could be tripled if the jury finds @entity1 broke federal anti-trust law			1
@entity1 stopped using the particular software in question in 2009 , which means the lawsuit only covers @entity16 models bought between september 2006 and march 2009			1
earlier in the trial , the prosecution told the court that @entity1 deleted songs from ipods that had been bought from rival music stores			2
each time an @entity1 user with @entity71 music tried to sync their devices , between 2007 and 2009 , the tech firm urged them to restore the players to factory settings			1
and the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files , and cause the users ' music libraries to ' blow up			1
' but @entity1 insisted the move was a legitimate security measure			0
now , @entity1 has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought @entity16 models covered by the lawsuit			1
@entity90 , who sometimes used her @entity16 to listen to music while ice skating , boarded a plane early tuesday and flew to @entity48 at the request of lawyers who are suing @entity1 on behalf of an estimated 8 million consumers who purchased @entity16 between 2006 and 2009 in the latest twist in the trial			1
@entity90 , who said she bought a special - edition @entity101 in 2006 because she liked its striking red case , contacted the lawyers and offered to help after reading an online news account that said the case was close to collapsing for lack of a named plaintiff			0
attorneys suing @entity1 have alleged that its use of restrictive software , which kept @entity16 from playing music purchased from competitors of @entity1 's @entity114 , effectively blocked rivals from the market and allowed the @entity118 , @entity48 company to sell ipods at inflated prices			1
@entity1 says the software was necessary to prevent unauthorized copying			0
the plaintiffs are seeking $ 350 million in damages , which could be tripled if the jury finds violations of federal antitrust law			1
@entity130 district judge @entity129 has repeatedly shown impatience with the plaintiffs ' attorneys for not doing a better job of vetting the original named plaintiffs in the case , who are supposed to represent the class of affected consumers			0
' we should n't have been here in the first place , ' @entity140 said as attorneys on both sides debated how to proceed tuesday morning			0
a moment later , the judge sharply disagreed when plaintiffs ' lawyer @entity147 suggested his side had suffered when @entity1 provided an incorrect list - which was later amended - of affected @entity16 models three years ago			1
' you never checked ' whether the last plaintiff had purchased the right models , the judge told @entity147			0
' so do n't talk to me ' about that , ' she added			0
@entity90 's answers to questions in court suggested she was n't fully up to speed on the complex allegations in the case , but @entity140 said she was tentatively satisfied that @entity90 qualifies for the job of class representative			0
the judge said she wo n't rule until @entity1 attorneys have a chance to question @entity90 more closely in a deposition outside court			0
@entity1 shares closed up $ 1.72 at $ 114.12 on tuesday			0
the latest twist comes after than three years after his death , legendary @entity1 ceo @entity28 held an @entity174 courtroom transfixed as attorneys played a video of his testimony in a class - action lawsuit that accuses @entity1 of inflating prices by locking music lovers into using @entity1 's @entity16 players			1
looking gaunt and pale , @entity28 spoke softly during the deposition he gave six months before his death in october 2011			2
despite this , he gave a firm defense of @entity1 's software , which blocked music from services that competed with @entity1 's @entity114			2
' we were very scared ' of the prospect that hackers could break @entity1 's security system , @entity28 said , because that might jeopardize @entity1 's contracts with music recording companies that did n't want their songs to be pirated			1
' we would get nasty emails from the labels , ' he added			0
@entity1 ceo @entity28 stands next to a projection of an @entity101 at an @entity1 announcement in @entity201			2
dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans , @entity28 appeared impatient at times and swivelled in his chair during the interview session shown in court , which was recorded at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity118 , @entity48			2
@entity28 was known for having a short temper			0
but he seemed unruffled when an attorney for the plaintiffs read part of an email in which the @entity1 ceo demanded that a record company executive publicly apologize for praising rival @entity217 for producing software that would make songs from the @entity217 store play on @entity1 's ipods			0
dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans , @entity28 appeared impatient at times and swiveled in his chair during the session , which was recorded at @entity1 's headquarters in @entity118 , @entity48			2
he said he did n't remember why he was upset with the recording executive			0
but he acknowledged that he had proposed language for an @entity1 press release that condemned @entity217 as a ' hacker			0
' ' we are stunned that @entity217 has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the @entity16 , and we are investigating the implications of their actions ' under federal law , the release said			0
claimants say @entity1 's ( co-founder @entity28 is pictured ) restrictive software froze out competitors			2
