menopausal symptoms could be an early warning sign of women whose bones will deteriorate more quickly , it is claimed women who suffer hot flushes and night sweats during the menopause are more likely to break a hip than women who do n’t , warn researchers			1
menopausal symptoms could be an early warning sign of women whose bones will deteriorate more quickly , it is claimed			1
a @entity16 study using data from almost 24,000 older women looked at hip fracture rates up to eight years later			1
more than two thirds of women going through the change suffer hot flushes – known as hot flashes in the @entity16 – and they can last for several years			1
dr @entity25 , of the @entity26 at the @entity27 , @entity28 , said ‘ our findings suggest women who exhibit moderate or severe menopausal symptoms are more likely to have issues with bone health than their peers			1
‘ this is the first large cohort study to examine the relationship between menopausal symptoms and bone health in menopausal women			1
’ the prospective study examined data from 23,573 participants in the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) @entity43 , who were aged between 50 and 79			2
the study tracked women ’s annual visits to clinical centres for 8 years , on average			1
women were asked about their menopausal symptoms , including hot flashes and night sweats , during the initial visit			2
they were then were monitored for fractures during the follow - up period			0
almost 5,000 also had their bone mineral density measured to gauge bone strength , says a report published in the @entity62 ’s @entity61 ( must credit )			0
women who reported having moderate or severe hot flushes when they entered the study were more likely to fracture a hip during the follow - up period than women who had no menopausal symptoms			1
after researchers adjusted for age and other factors , they found women with moderate to severe symptoms had lower bone mass density at the neck and spine during the follow - up period than women with no symptoms			1
the menopause speeds the body ’s normal process of bone loss , but the findings suggest it may be even faster in women with symptoms			2
dr @entity87 said ‘ more research is needed to illuminate the connection between bone health and menopausal symptoms			0
‘ improved understanding would help clinicians advise women on how to better prevent osteoporosis and other bone conditions			0
’ but @entity98 experts say hormone replacement therapy ( @entity100 ) is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms			0
a new review out today ( fri ) says hot flushes and night sweats affect around 70 per cent of women for an average of 5 years but may continue for many years in about 10 per cent of women			2
more than two thirds of women going through the change suffer hot flushes – known as hot flashes in the @entity16 – and they can last for several years in the @entity98 an estimated one million women are prescribed @entity100 in their 50s to replace natural supplies of oestrogen that diminish during the menopause causing symptoms such as hot flushes			1
@entity100 is known to slow bone loss and increase bone density			0
controversy over @entity100 being linked to breast cancer , heart disease and stroke led to a dramatic fall in users			0
but a reappraisal of @entity100 carried out by experts found the extra health risks mostly applied to older patients in their 60s and 70s , who do not normally use @entity100 but were given it for research purposes			0
younger women can benefit from @entity100 at the onset of the menopause , says the new review published in @entity142 ( must credit )			2
doctors should not be concerned about discussing the risks and benefits of @entity100 with women who have menopausal symptoms , or hesitate to offer a trial of appropriate treatment , it says			0
@entity151 , honorary senior lecturer and consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at @entity154 , @entity155 , and co-author of the review said ‘ women are sometimes concerned about the increased risk of breast cancer related to @entity100			0
‘ however , this risk is much lower than that associated with other factors such as obesity , alcohol consumption and later maternal age			0
‘ @entity100 is the most effective treatment for symptoms of the menopause and when @entity100 is individually tailored , women gain maximum advantages and the risks are minimised			2
‘ there are various types and regimens of @entity100 and healthcare professionals will be able to advise on the suitability of @entity100 to any woman			0
’ women with severe symptoms were 78 per cent more at risk of hip fracture than those without .			1

menopause symptoms could be a warning sign of deteriorating bones
@entity16 study looked at data from almost 24,000 older women for eight years
those with moderate or severe flushes were more likely to fracture a hip
