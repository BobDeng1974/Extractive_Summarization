@entity0 has urged tactical voters to back the @entity3 @entity2 in tomorrow ’s local elections			1
in an extraordinary intervention , the @entity6 grandee said @entity2 ’s policies were now those ‘ closest to a traditional conservative agenda ’			1
and he urged right - leaning voters in @entity12 areas to vote tactically for whichever candidate had the best chance of causing an upset – even if they are not @entity6			1
amid growing signs that the @entity18 could haemorrhage support to @entity2 , @entity16 signalled an end to personal attacks on his rivals , insisting : ' i 'm not calling anybody anything			1
' the parties go into battle in 34 councils in tomorrow 's elections , with the @entity18 braced for big losses in areas last contested in 2009 when @entity31 was leading @entity12 to a major defeat			1
but all eyes will be on what impact @entity2 can make , and how many votes it can take from the bigger parties pollsters predict @entity2 could win between 40 and 100 seats when voters got to polls in 34 councils in @entity42 and @entity43			1
@entity46 's @entity45 party is fielding almost as many candidates as the @entity48 , and is confident of coming at least third in the overall share of the vote			0
one poll of areas where elections are being held on thursday put @entity2 on 22 per cent , well ahead of the @entity48 on 12 per cent and only just behind @entity12 on 24 per cent			1
the conservatives were in first on 31 per cent , but @entity6 strategists fear their recent attacks on @entity2 could backfire and see more voters switch to back mr @entity46			1
@entity0 , who has been warned by @entity16 against making @entity60 remarks – said he would vote @entity6 because he supported his local @entity6 council			1
but , in comments on a newspaper blog that could result in disciplinary action , he added : ‘ if you have a @entity12 councillor then i suggest that the best vote is the one most likely to replace him or her with either a @entity6 , @entity2 or sound independent one			1
’ @entity2 has been under sustained assault from the @entity18 , with @entity72 branding the party a ‘ collection of clowns ’ supported by ' racists '			2
and @entity6 sources believe the @entity45 party could do serious damage tomorrow with conservatives potentially forced to go into coalition with @entity2 councillors in once - safe @entity6 areas			1
but @entity0 said his party ’s tactics were counterproductive and accused senior @entity18 , including mr @entity72 , of waging a ‘ smear campaign ’ against @entity2 which could drive disaffected voters into the arms of the smaller party			1
@entity16 has curbed criticism of @entity2 in recent days amid fears the attacks could backfire and encourage more voters back the @entity45 party			1
@entity0 ( right ) risks a rebuke from the @entity6 leadership for his suggestion that tactical voters should support @entity2 in some areas @entity0 added : ‘ it may well be that many former @entity6 voters are so fed up with the @entity16 coalition that they will turn to @entity2 as the party which comes closest to a traditional @entity6 agenda , and a reasoned position on the @entity105 issue			1
one can hardly blame them for that			0
’ in 2009 , @entity0 urged a boycott of all three main parties – bringing a sharp rebuke from mr @entity16 , who suggested the peer could be kicked out of the party if he went further and actively backed @entity2			1
today mr @entity16 refused to be drawn into the row over @entity2 being branded ' clowns ' and ' racists '			1
he told @entity116 's @entity115 : ' i ’m not calling anybody anything , what i ’m doing is talking about what the @entity6 offer at the local elections and in the end it ’s people who will go and vote and people who will choose			1
' he said he would not make predictions about the scale of @entity6 losses in tomorrow 's elections			1
' the conservatives are defending more seats than anyone else , we control more councils than anyone else , so everyone ’s having a shot at us			2
' however , foreign secretary @entity137 today defended mr @entity72 's criticism of @entity2			1
he told @entity139 : ' i think when you look at the financial commitments you can see why a former chancellor thinks they have a clown - like aspect			1
' he went on to insist votwers had to make a ' choice ' between @entity12 and the @entity18			1
' voting for a fringe party is opting out of that choice and wasting your vote ' he added			0
in recent days @entity2 leader @entity46 has been forced on to the back foot over his party ’s ‘ very odd ’ candidates – one was pictured apparently giving a @entity157 salute			2
mr @entity46 acknowledged the photo of @entity160 candidate @entity159 did ‘ not look very pretty ’ – but insisted the party did its best to weed out extremists			0
he said @entity2 had a blanket ban on former @entity165 activists and had rejected a number of candidates who ‘ seemed to be very , very odd ’			2
but he admitted the rapid growth of the party meant some undesirables had slipped through the net			0
‘ we have done what due diligence we can at branch level , ’ he said			0
‘ if people seemed to be very , very odd we did n’t accept them but we have taken people on faith			0
‘ we do n’t have the resources to trawl through absolutely everybody ’s social media sites and that has led to one or two embarrassments			0
’ mr @entity159 was suspended from the party yesterday pending a police investigation into a series of allegedly racist postings on his @entity190 page			0
in one picture he was photographed apparently making a @entity157 salute			0
in another , he was pictured in front of a @entity197 flag holding a dagger between his teeth			0
@entity2 leader @entity46 was questioned about his party 's vetting of candidates during a campaign visit with @entity205 , right , in @entity207 , @entity208 mr @entity159 yesterday strenuously denied making the comments , claiming his @entity190 account had been hacked			2
he said the words attributed to him were appalling , adding : ‘ i am completely against the @entity157 beliefs , i am a democratic libertarian			0
’ mr @entity159 said the picture of him apparently making a salute had been taken as he reached out to grab a camera from a friend who had been ‘ taking a photograph of me pretending to be a houseplant ’			0
the picture with the dagger was taken while he was getting ready for a fancy dress party , he said			0
candidate : @entity159 giving the alleged @entity157 salute mr @entity159 will continue as a candidate in the @entity227 ward because the ballot paper has already been printed but he will be an independent if he is elected			0
n there was further chaos in @entity2 ranks last night as the father of a rising @entity6 star tried to withdraw his candidacy for the party just 90 minutes after it was announced			1
securing the support of @entity241 – a @entity236 and parent of right - wing mp @entity238 – was a coup for the @entity45 party			0
but shortly after yesterday ’s announcement that he was their candidate in the @entity246 ward of @entity247 , mr @entity241 told a journalist he had stood down			0
it is understood he was unable to withdraw fully since his name was already on the ballot paper			0
sources claimed he had a ‘ wobble ’ after conservative central office was alerted to his candidacy			0
a @entity257 poll yesterday put @entity2 on 14 per cent , ahead of the @entity48 on 11 per cent			2
@entity12 ’s @entity258 is also under pressure to live up to his @entity261 slogan by making big gains in the south of @entity42			2
the @entity18 have challenged @entity12 to win an extra 1,000 seats , although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely			1
however , @entity2 could be the big winner of the night with the party confident it can push the @entity48 into fourth place in total votes cast			2
tories fear they could lose 400 seats			0
conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the @entity18 were as far ahead in the polls as @entity12 are now			2

today opinion polls put @entity12 up to 10 points ahead of the @entity18			2
one cabinet minister claimed based on a uniform swing @entity12 should gain 1,500 seats but 1,000 was more realistic			2
@entity12 has sought to downplay expectations , predicting just 200 gains			0
in 2009 it suffered catastrophic losses in areas where the party once dominated , including losing 28 of 44 seats in @entity288 and 29 or 32 seats in @entity290			0
other councils where @entity12 is expected to make strong gains are all in the north of @entity42 , including @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297			0

just a year before the general election which forced mr @entity31 out of power , @entity12 lost of four councils and 291 seats			2
after being humiliated by the @entity3 @entity2 in the @entity307 by - election , the @entity18 will seek to portray @entity2 as being allies of @entity12 , warning a vote for any party other than @entity6 will lead to council tax rises			1
voters will be told that backing @entity2 will allow @entity12 to gain control of councils and drive up bills			1
‘ if you want to put up your council tax , vote @entity2 or @entity12 , ’ will be a key message			1
