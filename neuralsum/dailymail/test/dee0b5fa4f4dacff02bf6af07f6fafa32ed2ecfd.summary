@entity0 stunned the @entity1 with a goal from his own half in @entity5 's clash with @entity6 on saturday evening			1
here is a look back at some of the finest examples of the genre			0
@entity0 struck a stunning goal from inside his own half against @entity6 at @entity14 @entity15 was left helpless also his @entity6 side eventually went on to win 2 - 1 @entity17 the midfielder would go on to be a world - renowned , generational talent - but was only an emerging figure when , on the first day of the 1996 - 97 season , he spotted @entity24 goalkeeper @entity23 off his line and arced the ball perfectly over him and into the net to round off a 3 - 0 win			1
@entity17 struck from inside his own half for @entity30 against @entity24 in 1996 @entity17 celebrated the final goal in 3 - 0 win for @entity30 on the opening day of the 1996 - 97 season @entity34 an even greater rarity - a headed goal from a player in his own half			1
@entity42 's @entity41 side were leading 2 - 1 , @entity39 's goalkeeper @entity38 was up for a corner and the ball was cleared towards @entity41 's centre forward			1
defender @entity46 nodded the ball away from him and just back across the halfway line , where @entity42 met it with a powerful header which carried at least 30 yards and bounced into the unguarded net			0
local police measured the goal at 58.13 metres , earning @entity42 a spot in the @entity54 for the longest headed goal			0
@entity56 the @entity58 midfielder actually achieved the feat twice in 2006 while with @entity60 - and once with each foot , for good measure			2
the left - footed effort was into an empty net , with @entity66 keeper @entity65 up for a corner in injury time of an @entity69 tie the @entity70 won 5 - 3 , but he then launched a flat lob over @entity73 keeper @entity72 from the edge of the centre circle inside his own half in the @entity1			2
@entity56 celebrates scoring from his own half for @entity60 against @entity73 in 2006 @entity72 was helplessly beaten in the @entity73 goal by the @entity58 midfielder 's superb effort @entity81 the @entity83 forward was out on the right sideline , a couple of yards inside his own half , when @entity88 keeper @entity87 's clearance dropped to him			1
@entity89 simply swung a first - time right foot volley at the ball , which bounced once in the middle of the penalty area before finding the top corner perfectly			0
@entity95 the then - @entity97 defender displayed great quick thinking against @entity5 in 2009 when his side were awarded a free - kick near the halfway line			0
@entity102 fouled @entity103 and , with most of the players napping , @entity95 ran straight on to the stationary ball to blaze a shot over @entity107 and in			0
@entity97 's @entity95 ( second left ) struck from behind halfway against @entity5 in 2009 @entity108 again , the @entity110 goalkeeper was up for a free - kick , but that should not detract from @entity115 midfielder @entity114 's achievement as the ball was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area and he simply controlled it on his chest , turned and volleyed the ball into the net from a scarcely believable 83 yards to make it 2 - 0			1
@entity114 of @entity115 ( centre ) celebrates his stunning goal against @entity125 in september 2014 @entity0 the @entity5 man has previous for this kind of behaviour , having showcased the skill during two loan spells from @entity131 earlier in his career			2
an effort for @entity135 's reserves was just inside the @entity137 half , but one for @entity138 against @entity139 in 2007 was just about on the line - close enough to give him the benefit of the doubt , in any case			0
