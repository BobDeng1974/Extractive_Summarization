by @entity0 reform : sir @entity2 , former president of @entity3 , said that the current higher education system is ' messy and muddled ' and that many existing institutions should be closed or merged half of @entity9 universities should be closed and others merged in sweeping reforms to the ' messy , muddled ' higher education system , a leading academic has said			1
sir @entity2 , former president of @entity14 - which represents 121 of the nation 's universities - said that there were too many universities and that they were not focusing enough on research and education			1
he said that this created a ' messy , muddled non-system ' that was ineffective and in need of significant change			0
the former vice-chancellor of @entity26 , which was formed by the merger of two of the capital 's institutions , said that major cities like @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 did not need to have more than one university and said they should either close or merge			2
writing in the @entity38 magazine he said : ' in @entity32 , the situation is even more bizarre , with some 40 universities within the @entity41 and more arriving by the day			0
' he said that in the current system universities in the same city were left ' glowering at each other and competing to attract the attentions of businesses and local authorities			1
' there was also a suggestion that universities such as @entity34 and @entity51 should stop recruiting undergraduate students and focus instead on postgraduate study and research			1
this plan would affect more than 6,000 undergraduate students a year who are enrolled at the elite institutions			0
sir @entity2 also suggested that universities should be allowed to increase the current £ 9,000 cap on tuition fees for undergraduate students			1
he said that without an increase institutions that are supposed to be independent would remain dependent on public money and fees from international students - who pay more than those based in @entity9			0
the argument to raise fees has also been put forward by current @entity14 president and @entity72 vice-chancellor sir @entity71 who said that they should be raised in line with inflation			2
in an interview he said that fees ' ca n't remain frozen forever ' and that in real terms , by 2016 , oncurrent inflation rates the maximum fee will be worth about £ 8,250			0
lack of focus : @entity82 at @entity34			0
sir @entity2 said that universities such as @entity34 and @entity51 should stop recruiting undergraduates and focus instead on postgraduate study and research sir @entity2 's comments come just before he delivered a lecture at @entity89 , @entity32 , where he has been provost for the past six years			1
they are at odds with the view of universities minister @entity93 , who has indicated that he intends to expand on the number of higher education institutes - there are currently more than 150 - by building campuses in areas where there are none			2
in addition to teaching and research , many of universities host conferences , organise catering services , offer career advice - they even invest in the stock market .			0
