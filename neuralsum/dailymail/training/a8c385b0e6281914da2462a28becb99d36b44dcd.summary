by @entity0 this is the moment @entity2 was struck by a mighty meteorite yesterday - and our only record of it is this image , captured by a lone webcam chugging away in the early hours of the morning			1
as the people of @entity11 carried out their lives unawares , it seems our gas giant neighbour took a forceful blow to the side at about 11.35am gmt yesterday			2
amateur astronomer @entity16 , from @entity17 , captured the flash on video at 5:35am cet - but he only went to check his footage after hearing online that another astronomer , watching the planet with his own eyes , saw the huge explosion bloom out of @entity2 in the blink of an eye			1
what a moment : @entity2 was struck by an asteroid yesterday , as confirmed by this image and a separate eye - witness now astronomers are waiting for the planet to swing back round - to see if @entity2 has been scarred by the impact			1
if it has , a black smudge is likely to appear on the ' clouds ' of the planet , a distinctive mark to go alongside the @entity37 - @entity2 's giant storm			2
@entity2 has been known as the ' cosmic vacuum cleaner ' of the solar system			0
the planet 's mass and large orbit sweeps up the scattered meteors that are relics from the early days of our solar system formation , with the planet either ' taking the bullet ' itself , or deflecting orbits away from the inner planets			0
many astronomers believe life would not have got started on @entity11 with @entity2 's influence - and before our solar system settled down , @entity11 was frequently bombarded with giant impacts			1
@entity2 has taken many a hit from the rocks that maraude their way through the solar system - remnants from the early days of the solar system when rocks would co-coalesce to form our planets			1
asteroid impacts were reported in 2009 and 2010 - and in 1994 , the string of comets known as @entity66 ploughed into the planet , offering us an eerie glimpse of what happens in during such colossal impacts			0
@entity16 , who blogs about his images , who went back through the footage recorded by his telescope overnight to find the impact , said : it 's kind of a scary proposition to see how often @entity2 gets hit			1
' his image was captured by a 12 - inch @entity75 and a @entity82 video camera attached to capture imagery for a composite picture of @entity2			2
he said : ' @entity2 happens to be ideally positioned at about 6 o'clock in the morning - it 's right overhead			0
' the flare lasted just two seconds - and @entity89 ' equipment happened to capture the shot at exactly the right moment for the above image			0
1994 : marks from the impact of comet @entity66 9 on the clouds of @entity2 , about two hours after impact @entity66 : the pieces of the comet all hit at roughly the same spot but at different times , and the planet rotated beneath it , the impact sites are spread along like a string of pearls in many ways it is pure chance the flash was captured			1
astronomer @entity109 saw the impact live and reported it on the @entity112 ' @entity2 forum			1
@entity16 visited the forum , saw the report , and decided to check his footage			2
he said : ' i decided to just observe on this particular morning			0
' had i been imaging i probably would have missed it while playing with webcam settings and focusing			0
' he told @entity120 : ' i never would have looked ' if he had n't heard the buzz on the forums , but luckily he checked his records for the same time reported by @entity109 - 6:35am ct , 7:35 am et , or 11:35 gmt - and found the image , appearing in just one frame			1
later today as @entity2 's spin turns the right part of the planet 's face back to @entity11 , astronomers will hunt out any visible signs of the impact			2
however , as @entity16 told , he will probably be in bed at the time			0
' i 'm almost 70 years old , he said			0
' and it takes a lot out of me to get up at 4:30 or 5			0
' hopefully , there will be a smear			0
if not , there would have been no record of the cosmic impact - other than in the eyeballs of an amateur astronomer , and a blurry still captured on a webcam .			1

@entity2 was hit during the day yesterday - but it apparently went *unobserved* from @entity11
*...* except for one astronomer , @entity109 , who saw the flash with his own eyes
when @entity109 reported the *sighting* on a web forum , amateur astronomer @entity16 checked his overnight footage
