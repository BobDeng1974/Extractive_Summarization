not so many years ago @entity2 had a reputation for running a mile at the thought of ' foreign muck ' - many even taking their own tea bags and favourite foods away with them			2
but researchers have found @entity2 are far more likely to try new types of food when abroad than when they are at home			2
respondents also identified food markets as a ' must visit ' on their trips away , many stating that they have taken inspiration from celebrity chefs such as @entity30 and the @entity31 to pick up foodie ideas and ingredients to take home			1
the study also discovered that many brits are now looking towards foreign shores to inspire their own dinner parties and fuel the ‘ @entity40 ’ culture			2
the poll of more than 960 people by @entity43 found the majority of @entity2 ( 97 per cent ) are likely to be more adventurous with their food when on holiday than when they are back home			0
inspiration : celebrity chefs like the @entity31 , @entity31 and @entity52 , have been credited for helping changing @entity54 attitude towards ' foreign muck ' and three out of four @entity2 ( 77 per cent ) try to recreate their favourite foreign dishes when they return to @entity54 shores			1
the most popular dishes brits tried for the first time when overseas include snails ( six per cent ) and frogs ( five per cent )			0
the survey also unearthed the more unusual items eaten by @entity2 abroad included sheep ’s brain , cherry soup and one person admitted eating bees while on holiday			1
snake while ostrich , birds nest soup and even guinea pig are n’t unlikely to make the menu , we ’re trying to impress friends with our culinary creations more than ever before , taking inspiration from our travels			0
@entity84 , managing director of @entity43 @entity54 , said : ' when we arrive on holiday we automatically feel a sense of adventure and this seems to be transferred onto our palette			0
' the traditional dinner party is back in fashion and we are now looking to impress with international dishes rather than the traditional meat and two veg			0

the likes of @entity30 and the @entity31 have been credited for changing attitudes
some travellers said they had now *tucked* into sheep *'s* brain and bees
