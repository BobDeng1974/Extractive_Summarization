a @entity0 which was transported in separate pieces along a motorway on @entity3 may have been on its way to a special forces training base where it will be used by elite soldiers to practise rescuing hostages from planes captured by terrorists			1
the large jet caused travel chaos earlier this month when it was driven by police escort from @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , down the @entity18 dual carriageway between @entity19 and @entity20			1
at first the jumbo jet was believed to be on the way to a university studio for interior design students			2
but now it has emerged that it may have been travelling to a hidden underground bunker in @entity27 to be used for training by the @entity30 regiment			1
a @entity0 747 seen being driven on the @entity18 between @entity19 and @entity20 may have been on its way to a £ 10million hidden bunker for @entity34 training , where it may be used by soldiers to simulate hostage situations an illustration shows how a @entity0 may be used in the bunker to simulate a real hostage attack on a jet people living nearby claim to have seen the plane arriving and @entity45 , director of quality and business at the @entity49 academy which was the jet 's original believed destination , said it had not arrived there			1
last april it emerged that the bunker , beneath the @entity27 base of the @entity34 , was to be used by the elite force for training			1
according to reports the £ 10million base is large enough to contain jumbo jets so that soldiers can use them to practise how to deal with incidents where terrorists capture planes and hold dozens of hostages for ransom			1
the appearance of the plane has led to speculation that the bunker may be near completion , as the @entity73 steps up surveillance and anti-terror patrols in the wake of recent attacks in @entity78			2
last week the plane was believed to be on the way to @entity49 but never arrived			0
instead , the lorries carrying it had parked overnight at @entity83 at @entity84 and the plane was seen being driven through @entity86 the next day			0
villagers living near the top secret bunker in @entity27 told the @entity89 they saw an aircraft going into the remote @entity91 - believed to be around 16 miles from the well equipped bunker			2
the state - of - the - art facility was previously said to be being built below ground to reduce the threat of an @entity97 attack and also to cut the noise currently caused by explosions and constant rifle fire during exercises			0
because it is underground it is not able to be seen from the air or satellite surveillance			0
last april it emerged the bunker will include firing ranges of 200 yards and special insulation to reduce the sound of bullets in the walls beneath the @entity113 that will make up the secret training base the bunker is said to contain ' kill rooms ' designed to mimic real situations the forces may find themselves in it is also expected to contain kill rooms , designed to mimic the real buildings crack teams may one day have to fight in.the site has a 200 yard firing range and walls covered with rubber insulation to reduce the sound from gun fire and explosions			1
previous reports have confirmed plans for a passenger jet to be used on the site			0
the plane is set to be used at least once a week by the counter-terrorist team , which is on permanent standby to respond to any threat to national security , including hijack situations			0
the bunker is said to be large enough to contain several of the aircraft , which measure 22 feet wide , 16ft 3ins high and is 137ft long			0
the @entity0 was transported by police escort on february 14 and caused long tailbacks on the roads despite being split into several parts the plane still took up two lanes of the motorway creating problems people living near the @entity34 base claimed to have seen a @entity0 arriving at the @entity152 site on february 14 the @entity0 was cut into several pieces to be transported through @entity19			1
the front section and cockpit of the @entity0 ' was loaded onto a large lorry as it was driven along the @entity157			2
the abnormally large load took up two lanes of the motorway , causing long tailbacks			0
the @entity160 declined to comment when contacted by @entity161			0
a spokesman said : ' the @entity160 do not discuss any matters pertaining to @entity73 @entity164			1
’ the @entity91 site was revealed as an @entity34 training ground during the inquest of @entity170 commando @entity169 @entity168 in 2007			2
he died after he fell 100ft from a helicopter during an exercise to practise a night attack .			0
