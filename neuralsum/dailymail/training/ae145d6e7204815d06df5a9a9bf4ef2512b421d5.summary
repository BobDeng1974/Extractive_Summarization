greengrocer @entity11 before she lost the equivalent of a sack of potatoes in weight and dropped four dress sizes by eating her own fruit and vegetables the super-slimmer decided to lose the weight when her hefty diet of 4,000 calories per day resulted in her tipping the scales at 16 - and - a - half - stone , and she was getting out of breath just carrying crates of produce around her shop			1

i was always conscious of my weight and would never get in a swimming costume			0
' at work , i found myself getting tired quite easily and struggling to lug around heavy sacks of potatoes			0
so i decided i had to do something about it - for both my professional and personal life			2
' through @entity45 i was able to literally eat unlimited amounts of fruit and vegetables - which is obviously on tap at my place			2
' there 's no calorie counting involved , so you just cut out things like dairy , cereal and bread			0
i replaced that with all the fruit and veg lying around the shop and it 's done the job			0
' luckily i have n't munched my way into the profits - there 's plenty to go around			2
