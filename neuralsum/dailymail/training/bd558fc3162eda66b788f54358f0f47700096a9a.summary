scientists have discovered a military fortress previously thought to have been destroyed under the prison yard at @entity3 , the @entity4 former prison and current tourist attraction			1
using radar technology , researchers from @entity7 found the remains of military buildings and tunnels dating back to 1850			1
the fort was built as @entity4 's fortunes boomed with the discovery of gold in @entity16 and it proved to be of strategic value at the outbreak of the @entity19 in 1861			1
no shots were ever fired from the @entity3 fortress , and at the beginning of the 20th century it was repurposed as a federal penitentiary			1
the fortress buildings were thought to have been destroyed - until now			0
' the main prison building was built in about 1915 , and we have photographs showing how the rec yard was constructed , ' says professor @entity29			0
scanning for secrets : @entity29 ( left ) and grad student @entity43 ( right ) taking underground readings on @entity3 deep underground : the red lines show where the fortress buildings lie beneath the present - day prison structures ' but what we do n't really know is what exactly became of the fortifications , what state they are in and what is left of the cultural resources			1
and although it is not always desirable to excavate , with geophysics we can help people to know what is below the surface without actually disrupting it			0
' the @entity7 team is using a radar that penetrates the ground and send signals to a receiver , which reflects the structures under the ground			2
scans of the prison yard have revealed a subterranean tunnel system that would have been used to transport people and ammunition , and would have been covered in earth to protect it			1
former life : taken in 1868 , this photo shows one of the many cannons that formed the garrison military history : in 1903 it was turned into a military prison , then it was made into a state penitentiary in 1934 ' we get signatures that indicate there is not only a tunnel , but magazine buildings too			1
' another expert , @entity94 's dr @entity93 , says parts of the fortifications were earthen and covered over with concrete that would have arrived in barrels from @entity99 , since the @entity100 was not producing its own at that time			2
it is some of the oldest concrete in existence in the @entity100			0
@entity105 buildings : testing on the parade ground shows that a large structure exists beneath the ground that researchers believe to be a caponier locked up : prisoners would spend most of their time in tiny cells on the island , occasionally spending an hour in the yard beneath which lay the remains of the fortress @entity29 and his team believe the most exciting discovery is lying in wait for them under the parade ground at the southern end of the island			2
' it is called a caponier , and it is a large structure that juts out into the bay and provides defensive cover			0
we have seen it in the old photographs but it has completely disappeared from present view , ' @entity29 told @entity31			0
the radar shows a very large structure exists beneath the ground			0
archaeologists hope to begin excavating the area soon			1
@entity140 was home to the ' worst of the worst			0
' during its 29 - year life as a prison , beginning in 1934 , some of the country 's most notorious prisoners passed though its cells , including @entity149 and @entity151 ' @entity150 .			2

radar scanning has revealed parts of a fortress that occupied @entity3 are intact beneath the prison
researchers from @entity7 found an underground tunnel system and other buildings
the military fort was built in 1850 and troops were stationed there during the @entity19
no shots were fired and it was *converted* into a prison in 1934
it ran as a prison for 29 years , and was home to some of @entity100 history 's most notorious *criminals*
archaeologists hope to begin excavations on part of the prison soon
