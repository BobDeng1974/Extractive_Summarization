by @entity1 reporter published : 13:51 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 25 january 2013 a @entity3 appeals court has overturned two of the four convictions that @entity6 faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her daughter 's disappearance in 2008			2
while @entity12 was acquitted of murder in two - year - old @entity6 's death in 2011 , she was convicted of four misdemeanor counts of lying to law - enforcement and sentenced to probation			1
judges on the 5th @entity19 have now agreed with @entity12 's attorneys that the charges constituted double jeopardy , or being convicted more than once for the same crime			1
victory : a court has overthrown two out of four convictions @entity6 faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her missing two - year - old daughter , @entity6 ( right ) , in 2011 jurors determined that @entity12 lied when she told detectives that she worked at @entity36 , that she had left @entity6 with a babysitter who kidnapped the girl , that she had told two friends about her daughter 's disappearance and that she had received a phone call from @entity6			1
the state said each of her four false statements to detectives was a separate offense , but her attorneys said all of her lies only constituted a single offense			2
the judge agreed the charges had constituted double jeopardy as the four lies had been made in the same interview			1
' we can not conclude that the @entity60 intended to authorize separate punishment for each false statement made during a single interview , ' they wrote			0
police questioning : @entity12 , pictured in a waiting room in @entity67 's jail where her attorneys said she learned of her daughter 's murder , told police four lies during questioning but a second charge stands as she lied to detectives again on a later occasion , judges ruled			1
the court said that she first made four false statements during her interview with @entity67 sheriff 's detective @entity82 at her home , the @entity77 reported			0
two of these lies were then repeated to @entity82 in a later interview at @entity36 , where @entity12 said she worked			0
' in light of the significant temporal break between @entity93 's two interviews with detective @entity82 , we determine that each interview in which false information was given ( or repeated ) constituted a separate criminal episode , ' the court ruled			2
the judges also ruled that the trial court was correct in allowing @entity12 's statements to detectives to be used during her murder trial			1
loss : among her lies , she said she had spoken to her daughter on the phone a day prior to the questioning ruling : @entity12 , pictured with @entity6 , then repeated the lies in a later police interview and enough time had passed for it to count as a second offense , a court has ruled her attorneys had argued that she was in police custody at the time and had not been read her rights			2
' we conclude that a reasonable person in [ @entity12 ] 's position would not believe " that his or her freedom was curtailed to a degree associated with actual arrest " , ' the panel ruled			2
in response to the ruling , @entity12 's attorney @entity126 said he was very happy that two convictions were overturned , and he would review the opinion on monday to determine whether they need to seek clarification on the two other counts			1
the next step for @entity12 and her attorneys would be to appeal the remaining two convictions to the @entity3 @entity138			0
freed : @entity12 is pictured reacting , right , as she hears she is not guilty of the charges in july 2011 scene : the two convictions were overthrown by judges on @entity3 's 5th @entity19 it also means that @entity145 's civil trial involving a woman with the same name as the fictional nanny , @entity148 , can move forward			1
it had originally been set to start on january 2			0
the civil trial is now tentatively scheduled for august , attorneys told @entity152			0
@entity148 , a @entity153 woman who had never met @entity6 , is suing her for defamation , claiming her life was ruined after @entity145 said @entity6 was kidnapped by a nanny with the same name			0
@entity12 was sentenced to a year of probation after her release from jail for an unrelated case			0
her whereabouts have been kept secret since she was released from state supervision last year , but a blurry cell phone image reportedly showed her eating at a @entity3 steak house last month			0

@entity19 ruled the charges constituted double jeopardy - but two stand as she lied to detectives on two separate occasions
