by @entity0 last updated at 7:00 pm on 1st february 2012 he did it in march 2010 ... and now he 's done it again			2
@entity4 , clearly a fan of @entity5 , has once more referred to @entity6 as ' @entity7 '			2
the prime minister first used the term during his budget response two years ago - and today , the @entity12 shadow @entity13 was reminded of the abrasive moniker			1
as @entity16 mps focused on the subject of the benefit cap , mr @entity4 mocked the @entity12 front bench for not stating its position on the issue			2
the @entity8 said : ' just nod - are you with us or against us ? ' as the camera panned across the faces of the @entity27 , mr @entity4 added : ' a great big vacuum			1
' and although mr @entity29 was present at the @entity30 , the @entity16 leader did n't seem to notice him , saying : ' where is @entity7 ? he 's not at home today			2
kind regards and good luck ! ' and although mr @entity4 managed to get away with his latest swipe at mr @entity6 without any chastisement , he did get a ticking off for calling @entity12 leader @entity56 a hypocrite mr @entity56 said legislation requiring banks to disclose how many employees were paid more than £ 1million was already on the statute book and could be implemented by ministers			1
but mr @entity4 told him : ' we now have the toughest and most transparent regime of any major financial centre in the world			2
' for the first time ever , banks are going to publish the pay of the top eight executives			0
that never happened in 13 years of a @entity12 government			0
' but he said sir @entity72 , who had proposed the reforms on publishing the number of £ 1million salaries , had recommended it should be done across the @entity77			0
mr @entity56 said the prime minister was giving ' no leadership on top pay ' and added that ' there are more than eight people earning over £ 1million at our banks '			1
he said chancellor @entity85 had backed the reforms before he took office and it was ' another broken promise '			0
mr @entity4 shot back : ' it was the last @entity12 government , when you were in the @entity90 , that agreed an @entity92 bonus pool of £ 1.3billion , literally hundreds of people were getting million - pound bonuses and you signed it off			1
' the issue for you is why are you in favour now in opposition of things you never did in @entity99 ? ' some might call it @entity27 , some people might call it hypocrisy			0
' mr @entity4 was forced to withdraw the comment after commons speaker @entity104 ruled : ' the use of the word hypocrisy in relation to an individual member is not parliamentary			1
' the prime minister said he was ' very happy ' to withdraw the comment , adding : ' i think it 's just because we are expected to listen to the people who presided over the biggest banking and financial disaster in our history			1
' mr @entity56 told mr @entity4 that hypocrisy was ' saying you are going to stop a £ 1million bonus to @entity121 and then nodding it through '			1
mr @entity121 bowed to mounting public pressure and waived his near - £ 1million share bonus after a public row over the payment			2
the @entity12 leader told mr @entity4 : ' i think we have now heard it all , because you said that the class war is going to be led by you and your cabinet of millionaires			0
' i do n't think it 's going to wash , frankly			0
' turning to the issue of putting workers on pay committees , mr @entity56 said it would ' bring a does of realism ' to salary awards			1
it would mean ' people on a huge salary at least have to look one of their employees in the eye and justify it '			0
mr @entity4 said : ' i do n't think it is practical to do what is suggested			0
it breaks an important principle of not having people on a remuneration committee who have their own pay determined			0
' so i do n't think it 's the right way forward			0
' the prime minister claimed that mr @entity56 wanted to ban performance - related pay in all but exceptional circumstances , which would be ' completely wrong ' and ' shows he has n't got a clue how to run an economy '			1
mr @entity56 said : ' now we know where the prime minister stands : no to transparency , no to an employee on the remuneration committee			1
' what was the chancellor doing last week when they were supposed to be cracking down on top pay ? he was going to @entity170 to tell the business community to lobby for a reduction in the top rate of income tax			0
' we know the truth : when it comes to top pay , this government and this prime minister are part of the problem , not part of the solution			0
' mr @entity4 , after the rebuke by the speaker over the use of the word ' hypocrisy ' , said : ' i do n't know what the word is for criticising someone who went to @entity170 , when you went to @entity170 yourself ... ' he added : ' i think the word @entity194 used ( about mr @entity56 ) when he was in @entity170 was " struggling "			1
' mr @entity104 quipped : ' the prime minister is exceptionally well - educated and i 'm sure he has got a very full vocabulary and can make proper use of it			2

@entity8 gets away with comment - but is chastised by speaker for calling @entity56 a hypocrite
