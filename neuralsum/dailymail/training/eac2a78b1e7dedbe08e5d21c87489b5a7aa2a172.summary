by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 10:45 est , 30 january 2014 he was the 14 - year - old boy who beat his mother to death in a hammer attack so violent , it left her skull smashed to pieces			1
now the former partner of victim @entity10 , 47 , mother of ' @entity12 killer ' @entity13 , has told of some of the bizarre behaviour he displayed in the run - up to the violent murder on @entity18 , two years ago			1
speaking in new documentary , @entity21 , @entity19 , 48 , from @entity20 , revealed that the troubled boy concealed bags of his mother 's underwear in his bedroom and would write gruesome stories before showing them to his family			1
troubling : @entity19 , 48 , the former partner of @entity10 has told of life with killer teen @entity13 ' it would be about 7pm on a weekday night and he 'd come down and show me a story he 'd written , ' remembers mr @entity19			1
' and it would be quite gory ; it would include someone getting killed and fighting , and this kid had hurt someone at school and that kid would go back and kill him ... ' i would read it and give it back to him and then he would go and show his mother and she was the same as me			2
she 'd give it back to him and be like " @entity13 , what are you writing that for ? " ' @entity13 had also , as police would later find , had written a soap which included a elaborate plot featuring a character called @entity56 who killed his mother			1
' the only place he could n't get away with his bad deeds was with his mother @entity61 , ' the script read			0
' so one night , he staged a break - in and murdered her with a hammer and then set her and the family home alight			1
' tragic : @entity13 was just 14 when he beat his mother @entity66 , 48 , to death with a claw hammer warning signs : mr @entity19 says @entity13 displayed odd behaviour in the weeks before the killing ' @entity56 was the character that done this but it was a soap plot , ' remembers mr @entity19			1
' as the character in the soap , he 'd got away with it , got away with it in court and then gone on to become a famous soap star			0
longest soap star in history , i think he 'd finished it off with			0
' tragically for @entity66 and her family , @entity13 , who was jailed for life with a minimum 16 year term last year , was n't just writing his fantasies down - he was planning to carry them out			1
late at night one @entity18 , @entity13 crept into his mother 's room and attacked her with a lump hammer , hitting her seven times on the head and jaw			1
to conceal his crime , he wrapped her body in newspaper before dousing it in petrol and setting it on fire			0
his mother 's body was so badly burned , it could only be identified using dental records			0
later , @entity10 told police that a burglar had killed his mother but just two days after the killing , he was charged with his mother 's murder			1
but a penchant for writing his gruesome fantasies down was n't the only indication that @entity13 was n't quite the normal boy that he seemed			1
according to mr @entity19 , he would also smash up @entity120 figurines and developed a habit of urinating and defecating inside his bedroom			2
' he had many expensive figurines of @entity120 characters and dr who characters , ' remembered mr @entity19			2
' they would be all ruined			0
he 'd have plastic boxes full of figures but he 'd just urinate in the boxes			0
he also defecated all over the bedroom and in the boxes and hid towels and stuff that he 'd wiped himself with			0
ablaze : after killing his mother , @entity13 set fire to the modest family home in a bid to conceal her body ' one of the things i found that disturbed me , but actually @entity61 laughed about it , was a bag of her underwear			1
obviously , i mentioned it to @entity61 and she was like " @entity148 " but she just brushed over it and said he was just having a prank , just messing around			0
' it was brushed over at the time but later on it became a bit more sinister			0
' criminal psychologist dr @entity156 comments : ' in this private room that @entity13 created for himself , as well as destroying the @entity120 figures and defecating , as a 14 - year - old boy , he was probably masturbating a lot and taking things that would feed his masturbatory fantasies			2
' the underwear from his mother that he stole could well have been part of that whole process and part of his internal fantasy life that became more than a fantasy in terms of what he planned to do			2
' @entity171 : the remains of @entity10 's bedroom following the blaze caused by her son murder weapon : the lump hammer recovered from the @entity178 home and used by @entity13 despite his bizarre behaviour at home , outwardly , @entity13 appeared to be nothing more than a normal boy			1
' he was just the boy next door , ' says mr @entity19			2
' if you saw him in the street , you would n't look at him twice			0
' he adds : ' it makes it more scary than anything else really			0
the fact he 'd been speaking to people , going to school and all along , he was planning , he knew he was going to murder his mum			0
