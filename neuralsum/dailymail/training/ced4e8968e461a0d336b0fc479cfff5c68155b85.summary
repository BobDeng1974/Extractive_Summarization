@entity0 lives in the same house as his children and sees them every day â€“ yet he is unable to recognise them at all			1
mr @entity0 , 46 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , is living with a bizarre condition called prosopagnosia , also known as face - blindness , meaning he struggles to recognise faces - even those of his own family			1
mr @entity0 , a painter , has been forced to memorise his family 's voices and body language in order to know who they are			1
but reading voices and body language does n't always work , and has even mistaken another boy for his son when picking his children up from school before			1
he was born with the part of his brain responsible for facial recognition damaged			0
despite living with his wife @entity29 , daughter @entity29 , eight and son @entity30 , five , he struggles to recognise them mr @entity0 once mistook another boy for his son @entity30 , five , ( pictured ) when he was picking his children up from school mr @entity0 said : ' humans have a special ability to recognise people by seeing their faces , i really do n't have this ability			1
' maybe a good way to imagine what it 's like to have prosopagnosia is to try and recognise people by what their hands look like			1
' every person has a different hand but if someone showed you a photo of someone 's hands , you might struggle to recognise who the person is , even if that person turns out to be someone you know very well			2
' i just thought that everyone was the same or maybe i just was n't putting in as much effort as others to remember people			1
' if i saw my wife @entity29 somewhere unexpected and she pretended not to know me , then i 'm not sure i would know it was her			0
' it often leaves me in some awkward situations , especially when i do n't recognise people that i should or think i know people that i do n't			1
' i have learnt to recognise people based on their body language and voices instead			1
' mr @entity0 struggles to recognise the faces of his wife @entity29 , as well as his children @entity29 , eight , and @entity30 , five			1
mrs @entity76 said : ' when the children are in school uniform , they all look very similar to @entity0			1
' he once mistook someone else for our son , which got a very disapproving look from the boy 's mother			0
@entity87 is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people 's faces			2
also known as ' face - blindness ' , the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers			1
some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face , while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces , and in more severe cases sufferers can not distinguish a face as being different from an object			1
some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces			2
the condition is not related to memory loss , impaired vision or learning disabilities			2
it is thought to be the result of abnormalities , damage , or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory			2
@entity87 can result from stroke , traumatic brain injury , or some neurodegenerative diseases			0
in some cases the condition is congenital , and present at birth			2
it appears to run in families , which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion			0
some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and @entity140			0
treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies , including relying on voice recognition , clothing , or unique physical attributes			2
source : @entity149 ' if we 've met someone before i will try and tell him who it is before we speak to them			0
' it does cause some awkward situations but usually we just find it funny			2
' experts said propagnosia is not linked to problems with vision , memory or intelligence			0
instead , it is thought to be the result of impairment in the right ' fusiform gyrus ' of the brain - a fold that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory			2
this could be as a result of a stroke , traumatic brain injury , or some neurodegenerative diseases			0
or , in cases such as mr @entity0 's - the condition is present at birth , and the pathways in the brain responsible for recognition never developed properly			1
though he now knows he has had the had the condition all his life , mr @entity0 was only diagnosed in the last few years , through sheer chance			1
he said : ' i heard a programme about it on the radio and realised that 's what i had			0
@entity192 confirmed he was suffering from face - blindness			1
he said : ' i had to do tests where i was shown a number of faces , then i would be shown another set of faces , some that were shown before and some new ones			0
' i would have to say which ones i had seen before			0
my score was well below that of people without the condition			2
' we also had the same kind of test but instead of faces , we would have images of horses or houses and my scores would be in line with people without the condition			2
' it is thought the condition affects up to one in 50 people , the equivalent of about 1.5 million people in the @entity219			1
some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face , but in more severe cases sufferers can not distinguish a face as being different from an object			1
some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces			0
mr @entity0 's face - blindness is not so severe , but he has failed to recognise celebrities in the past			1
he said : ' growing up i loved films , but my favourite stars were always those that had distinctive voices or characters like @entity238 or @entity239			0
' @entity29 is @entity240 and once we saw a very famous rock band there			0
i met the drummer and was convinced he was @entity29 's neighbour			0
' i do n't think he was used to not being recognised and he was a bit annoyed			0
' although there is no treatment for the condition , mr @entity0 has learnt coping strategies			1
he said : ' most people know that i have it so it 's not a problem			0
' there are ways to cope			0
if i see someone who seems to know me then i ask them vague questions , like how are things , is work okay , until i can figure out who they are			0
' i also always say " nice to see you " rather than " nice to meet you " , just in case i have met them before			0
' mr @entity0 says if his wife @entity29 pretended not to know him , he probably would n't recognise her			1
if someone they know approaches them , mrs @entity76 whispers their name into her husband 's ear so he can greet them , even if he does n't recognise them there is a prosopagnosia research group at @entity277 , @entity6 , where mr @entity0 found out he suffered from the condition			1
researcher @entity279 , who has been working with mr @entity0 , said : ' individuals affected by this condition have trouble in recognising not only famous but also personally known faces such as friends or even family			1
they also struggle to learn new faces , while having normal vision , intellect and memory , she added			0
she continued : ' the ability to successfully recognise faces is an incredibly important skill which allows us to navigate in the complex social environment			0
' not being able to recognise faces can negatively affect people 's well - being and lead to anxiety in social situations , she said			1
' in extreme but rare cases it can lead to a person 's withdrawal and alienation , ' she said			0
' the impact of prosopagnosia on an individual depends on the severity of the condition , their individual predisposition and personality			2
' it 's also dependent on the presence or absence of other conditions and lastly but very importantly the attitude and awareness of the people who make up our social environment			0

@entity0 , 46 , suffers from prosopagnosia , also called face - blindness
has had to learn coping strategies to recognise his own family and friends
these include memorising their voices , mannerisms and body language
there is no cure for the condition , but his family ' try to find it funny '
it is thought to affect up to one in 50 people in some form
