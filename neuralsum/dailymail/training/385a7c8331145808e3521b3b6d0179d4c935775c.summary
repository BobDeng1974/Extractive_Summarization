while the @entity38 has so far eluded her , the @entity1 has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the @entity49 , among them @entity57 who managed to win both the @entity59 and @entity60 in 1977 , @entity61 , who triumphed in the @entity59 in 1957 and @entity62 who took the @entity64 in 1958			0
