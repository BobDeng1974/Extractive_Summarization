images revealing the shocking extent of gender stereotyping in toy shops have been posted online under the hashtag # @entity4			1
the pictures show a wide divide between the aspirations set out for girls and boys , with females offered pink beautician 's outfits while males are offered doctor 's uniforms			1
products intended for infants are equally polarised , with babygros for girls emblazoned with a slogan that reads : ' i hate my thighs '			1
the fancy dress options for girls and boys hint at very different future careers @entity27 reading ' i hate my thighs ' and ' i 'm super ' left customers in one store feeling cross by contrast , the boy 's effort offers up the much more pleasant : ' i 'm super '			1
the # @entity35 feed , which was launched by campaign group @entity36 , is based on the idea that the toys are so ridiculous that they must be a joke			1
the images sparked a furious response from @entity43 users , with several getting in touch to complain about the gender stereotyping			0
@entity46 's angry @entity43 was typical , with the journalist writing : ' when i was little @ @entity48 were actually about @entity49			2
now about learning gender stereotypes ? ' other examples included separate cookbooks , with boys getting to make gourmet burgers and giant chocolate sundaes , while girls make small pink cupcakes			1
girls ' cookbooks include recipes for delicate cupcakes , while boys are encouraged to make burgers @entity64 has become the colour of choice for companies marketing products for girls many more of the boys ' words evoke action and bravery whereas the girls ' ones focus on looks and fluff let toys be toys , a campaign group set up by a group of @entity81 parents two years ago , is petitioning retailers to end the practice of labelling products by gender			1
one of the campaign 's founders , @entity90 , 46 , a self - employed copywriter from @entity91 , told @entity92 : ' it does bother a lot of parents , we seem to have tapped in to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are promoted according to outdated , illogical and sexist stereotypes			1
' i ca n't speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was the realisation , after my daughter was born , that gender stereotyping in children 's products had become worse than when i was a child myself back in the @entity112			2
' it 's something that has become almost impossible to escape and is very limiting for children			2
' boys will be learning to draw warriors while women draw faces and flowers wizards and werewolves are favourite subjects for boys ' books - but not for girls many parents responded to the images of the sexist toys by posting pictures of their children playing with ' the other gender 's toys '			1
they included two girls playing with a train set , a little boy pushing a pram and a little girl covered in mud playing in the garden			0
the campaign has gathered momentum in response to what @entity145 describe as the increasing gender stereotyping of toys and the dearth of neutral playthings			1
not all , however , are so keen with many parents arguing that pink and blue toys are harmless			0
but campaigners point to the domestic nature of the majority of girls ' products and say that by contrast , boys are encouraged to play with science sets , cars and action heroes			2
but most items that relate to being domesticated are aimed at girls			0
in contrast boys are encouraged to play with science sets , cars and action heroes			0
not even food is immune as these differently coloured crisp packets reveal a blue and green slide marketed at boys also roused the ire of campaigners one mother who is throwing her weight behind the campaign is psychologist dr @entity176 , 44 , who told @entity92 that it is essential to challenge these stereotypes			0
' i think any toy or any activity that dispels the idea that a girl 's value lies just in the way she looks ; that shows she can be more than that , that she can do more , is a positive idea			0
' sadly female scientists or business leaders are n't celebrated in the same way that males are , so [ the launch of a range of female scientist @entity195 figurines ] is fantastic			0
' the younger you can get girls to see these things as the norm the better			0
getting them to see that it 's just as normal for a woman to wear a white doctor 's or scientist 's coat as it is for a man ; that 's such an important thing			0
' the whole idea that there is the whole idea that there is just one section for girls - the pink section - reinforces gender stereotypes			2
' of course , there 's always going to be evolutionary differences , but so many more toys aimed at girls have to do with being pretty and looking a certain way , whereas those all about having fun and action heroes are for boys			1
' girls need to be seen as doers rather than passive , to subvert the objectification of women			0
the object is someone acted upon ; " how can i make my hair curlier , my lips pinker , my eyes brighter "			0
' i think there 's a problem here			0
' # @entity236 is also a hashtag			2
parents sharing pictures of their ' princesses ' playing with ' boys ' toys ' # caringboys is pics of little boys playing with baby dolls and pushing them around in prams ( playing dad ) dr @entity176 says any activity that dispels the idea that a girl 's value lies just in the way she looks is positive			1
