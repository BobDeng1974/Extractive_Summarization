judge @entity16 , sitting at the appeal hearing at @entity15 today , refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and said she ' lost control '			2
@entity0 , left , lost the appeal for her conviction reality star @entity9 , right , who she says conducted a ' vendetta ' against her			2
mr @entity9 told the court he did not watch @entity24 as he lived in @entity25 but the judge said he had the ' greatest sympathy ' for @entity0 and revoked the fines and compensation she had originally been ordered to pay			1
mr @entity9 claimed that the singer has had a grudge against him since he published a link to a sex tape leaked by her ex-boyfriend , rapper @entity34 , in 2012			2
however , @entity0 claimed she remained calm during the incident and told the hearing that mr @entity9 had a ' strange obsession ' with her and insulted her mentally ill mother			1
she also said he conducted a ' vendetta ' against her after an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a vip area at the @entity44 nightclub in @entity46 's @entity45			0
mr @entity9 denied the claims and said that when @entity0 was a judge on the @entity24 he did not watch the show as he was living in @entity49 , where it 's not aired			1
it was put to mr @entity9 , who has joined the cast of @entity53 , by @entity0 ' counsel @entity54 : ' to suggest you do n't have an interest in x factor must be a complete lie			1
' @entity0 ( pictured leaving court during a break today ) told the appeal hearing that mr @entity9 had a ' strange obsession ' with her and outlined suspicions he was involved in releasing a sex tape of her online he responded : ' why must that be a complete lie ? there 's a lot of celebrity things happening daily that i do n't have any interest in			1
' following the three day hearing , judge @entity16 said : ' the appellant voiced concerns , for reasons that we understand and have some sympathy for that a person who had been a real thorn in her side , did not accompany her friends to the @entity12 where she was planning on passing the night			2
' that 's why and only why she then said what she said to mr @entity9 - we do n't find that she had a drink in her hand or was in any way demonstrably drunk			2
' the argument that undoubtedly followed was no doubt a result of pent up feelings about mr @entity9 which were then now doubt expressed in clear terms and she told us and she accepts that she became uncharacteristically aggressive			1
' the judge said it was likely that she had hit mr @entity9 to the left side of his face , but said : ' we 've seen no evidence of any injury or of any pain caused			2
' he added : ' we do have sympathy with what must have been quite a history of provocation , we accept that she has no previous conviction and this was a very brief moment of loss of control			0
' @entity0 shook her head and fought tears at the appeal hearing today as it became clear the verdict would go against her			1
judge @entity16 , sitting with two magistrates , said that a security guard who saw the incident was ' undoubtedly independent ' and made clear that he saw @entity0 strike a blow on mr @entity9			1
a woman had also said that what she saw was consistent with a blow having been struck			0
@entity0 was last year convicted of assaulting mr @entity9 at @entity10 in @entity11 in august 2013 the judge said @entity0 had accepted she became verbally aggressive			1
' we find she was not calm , this was a lack of self control - the reasons , we understand - and for a brief moment , we find that she did strike mr @entity9 , before very speedily the incident was brought to an end			1
' circumstantial evidence also supported the @entity135 's case , the judge said			0
' it is entirely logical so far as what might be expected to happen given the circumstances of the argument , and the previous history between the parties , that that brief excess of lack of control took place			0
' the former @entity147 singer had insisted she had asked mr @entity9 ' diplomatically ' to stop following her 15 - strong entourage as they headed towards her @entity12			0
mr @entity9 had attempted talking with former sugababe @entity150 , a friend of @entity0 , as they left the festival to turn in for the night			1
@entity0 said when mr @entity9 turned towards her @entity12 in the vip area instead of the main exit she politely told him he was not invited to join the party			1
the judge said he had the ' greatest sympathy ' for @entity0 and revoked the fines she had originally been ordered to pay last year she denied storming up to mr @entity9 aggressively , explaining she only needed to turn around to confront him because of their close proximity			1
in a ' calm ' and ' diplomatic ' manner she told mr @entity9 to go away , the court heard			1
' i was calm and relaxed until his instant reaction , which was aggressive			0
i did n't want to get into an argument or confrontation , ' she said			0
@entity0 said mr @entity9 instantly became aggressive , moving towards her and using abusive language			1
he called her a 's * * * , ' ' w * * * * , ' ' a nobody ' and went on to insult her mentally ill mother , the court heard			0
@entity0 admitted using terms such as ' b * * * * * * ' and 'd * * * * * * * , ' while keeping her hands behind her back throughout			0
the incident , which lasted around four minutes , escalated when @entity0 ' personal assistant @entity176 confronted mr @entity9			2
eventually @entity177 was led away by her tour manager towards the @entity12 as the argument continued			0
@entity176 , was also cleared at magistrates court of using threatening behaviour during the incident mr @entity9 was left with a puffy eye , the court heard , but claimed that he had lost the photograph he had taken despite being an avid @entity187 user			2
@entity0 admitted it was out of character for her to argue , but was adamant she did not become violent			0
she also claimed he followed her and once turned up outside her hotel room in @entity49 , and other time he unexpectedly showed up at her 23rd birthday party			0
she told the court she hoped mr @entity9 would be exposed as a ' liar			2
' the singer also claimed mr @entity9 had only become famous off the back of the animosity between the two and was why he had a part on reality tv show @entity53			0
@entity0 described the release of the sex tape in march 2012 was the ' worst time of my life '			0
she was also accused of helping to supply cocaine after she was set up by ' @entity206 ' @entity206 , but her trial collapsed			0
@entity0 , from @entity208 , north @entity46 , had the fine of £ 200 and £ 100 compensation amounts she was previously ordered her to pay revoked , but she was still ordered to pay £ 1,500 costs and a £ 15 surcharge			0
