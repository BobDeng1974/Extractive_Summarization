@entity0 might not appreciate the comparison but right now his @entity3 team more closely resemble @entity4 in their heady days under @entity5 than anything he has assembled before			1
@entity3 so far are the great entertainers and have scored and conceded more goals after five matches than any previous @entity0 team			1
wednesday night ’s 1 - 1 draw against @entity12 in the @entity13 means @entity3 have found the net 16 times but had their own defence breached on seven occasions			1
only in his 2011 - 12 season at @entity33 has @entity0 started a season anywhere like this one at @entity43			1
back then after five games in all competitions real had scored 15 goals and conceded six			2
ominous signals for the @entity49 chasing pack ; @entity33 won @entity50 that season , scoring a frankly ridiculous 121 times for a plus 89 goal difference to accrue 100 points			1
it was the season @entity56 bagged 50 league goals and @entity58 46			2
@entity60 ’s 24 - goal offering for @entity61 pales in comparison			0
@entity21 has begun this campaign on such form , with seven goals in four starts before failing to find the winner against @entity12 coming off the bench with 16 minutes remaining			1
his hamstrings prohibit excessive action each week and @entity0 must manage his £ 32million striker to ensure that if @entity3 fail to secure their backline , the @entity72 international can provide enough firepower to make amends			2
with @entity20 conducting from deep and @entity24 a devious presence further up , @entity3 will always carry a potent goal threat			0
@entity78 ( obscured centre ) scores for @entity12 at @entity43 on wednesday night @entity81 ( left ) and @entity82 ( second right ) are part of a settled @entity3 defence but they have let in seven but those seven concessions will irritate @entity0 , who has opened this season with a settled back four in front of one of the world ’s best goalkeepers			1
@entity82 , @entity81 , @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 have started every @entity49 game , with @entity96 slotting in at left back for wednesday night ’s game			0
that is a defence which should provide a solid base , but @entity101 penetrated it three times , @entity23 twice and @entity103 once			0
their only clean sheet thus far has come at home to @entity107 , who would have scored had @entity109 been cooler ( or @entity94 more panicked ) when clean through			0
@entity110 is the midfielder tasked with greatest defensive duty but he can bomb forward and leave spaces for counter-attacks to blossom			0
with @entity115 at the @entity117 next up for @entity0 – the scene of a sophisticated 1 - 0 victory last term – it may be he returns to his favoured trivote formation of three deep midfielders , with @entity123 recruited for added security			0
@entity0 ’s first season at @entity3 saw six goals scored and just one conceded in the opening five games			1
they went on to win the title comfortably and efficiently			0
there is nothing efficient about scoring six to counteract three conceded , or four to beat two , and as the season progresses expect the @entity134 to tailor his team accordingly			0
@entity137 has always wanted an exciting @entity3 team and it seems he is getting his wish			2

@entity3 have scored 16 goals so far this season but have let in seven
that is more than any previous @entity0 team after five matches ( @entity3 , @entity37 or @entity33 )
@entity0 's men are unbeaten and *top* of the @entity49
@entity3 drew their opening @entity13 match with @entity12
