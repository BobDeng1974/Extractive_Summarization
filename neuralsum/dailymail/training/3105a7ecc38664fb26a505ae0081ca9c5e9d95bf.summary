another victim : @entity1 was raped at @entity3 fraternity @entity2 in 1984 , the same house fingered in the recent @entity6 article now under question while the @entity6 article about an alleged gang - rape at @entity3 fraternity @entity2 is under question , there 's one detail from the story not in dispute - the fact that a woman was raped in a strikingly similar manner at the same house three decades ago			1
a @entity20 brother was convicted of the crime			1
victim @entity1 , has spoken out in the wake of the @entity6 article and it 's subsequent backlash , to tell @entity26 her own horrifying account of rape at the fraternity when she was a student at @entity3 in the mid- 1980s			1
she published a book on the experience titled ' @entity32 ' in 2011			1
earlier this month , she defended victim ' @entity33 ' and the rush to fact - check the @entity3 junior 's rape account , who @entity6 admits was not properly vetted in an apology letter			1
while @entity20 is named as the fraternity where @entity33 was gang - raped in the article , it is now unclear if she was assaulted at that house since she came out to say she was n't certain it happened at that specific fraternity			1
@entity45 though remembers exactly where her rape took place , and even knew one of per perpetrators			0
she was 17 - years - old in august 1984 when she left her home in @entity51 , @entity52 to study @entity53 at the @entity54 , @entity56 university			1
on the night of october 5 , 1984 , just five weeks into college , one of @entity1 's new friends @entity61 ( name changed ) asked her to be his date to a rush event at the @entity65 fraternity			1
she agreed , wanting to help her fellow freshman get into the exclusive all - boys club , and helped him talk to brothers at the event with a band , dancing and free booze			2
but the two got separated when they ventured upstairs and @entity61 was invited into a room to smoke marijuana with some of the brothers			0
while sitting on a couch , waiting for her date to return , @entity1 says two brothers at the bar asked her if she wanted a drink and she agreed			1
but things took a bad turn when she started to feel ' dizzy and disconnected ' after drinking the so - called ' house special '			1
' suddenly , after a few sips of the green drink , i noticed something wrong			0
i could not feel my hands or feet			0
my arms and legs began to feel numb			0
i started to panic , breathing shallowly and rapidly , ' @entity1 recalled			1
it was then that a tall brown - haired man with wire rimmed glasses sat down to talk to her , and she told him she was thinking about going home because she was feeling tired			2
scene : @entity1 says she was gang - raped by three men at the @entity65 house just five weeks after starting at @entity3 in 1984			1
she later brought one of her rapists to justice when he wrote a letter apologizing to her for the incident , which was used as evidence history repeating : @entity1 's story is strikingly similar to that of ' @entity33 ' ( pictured ) the current @entity3 junior who told a horrifying account of gang - rape at the campus fraternity to @entity6			1
@entity33 's account is now being torn apart after it was revealed she was n't completely certain the rape happened at @entity65 instead , he forcefully grabbed her arm and said ' i have something to show you ' before lifting her off the couch and taking her to a bedroom			1
@entity1 says that the man made her sit on his lap and began reading her poetry			1
panicked , she managed to escape and run down the hall to the room where her handbag had been stored			0
the door was locked so she began yelling and kicking the door			0
that 's when the music turned up and a brother behind the bar picked her up and took her back to the bespectacled man			2
the bespectacled man then pinned her down by the arms and legs and raped her repeatedly , despite her protestations			2
@entity1 says she passed out from the fear and pain but woke up a few times during the night , when she heard voices , slamming doors and felt hands on her			1
the next morning she woke up on an orange sofa across the hallway from where the rape occurred , and quickly fled the house , but not before sifting through her rapist 's mail , identifying him as a student named @entity148			1
she then walked to the @entity3 medical center for treatment , but after sitting in the emergency room for several hours a nurse came up and told she would need to travel to @entity153 or @entity154 if she wanted the necessary ' tests '			0
defeated , @entity1 walked back to her dorm room where she had to wait a full three days to report the incident to the then - @entity159 @entity158			1
sorry : while her initial attempts to bring her rapists to justice in 2006 were flouted by the university , @entity1 's rapist @entity160 was sentenced in 2007 after sending her the confession letter still bruised and battered , @entity1 says her monday meeting with @entity158 did not go well			1
' he dismissed me and told me i had “ had sex with a young man and did n’t want my parents to know i was n’t a good girl			0
” he suggested i needed mental help , and offered to help me transfer to another college , ' @entity1 says			2
@entity158 also told @entity1 that she could not report the rape to the @entity176 , since it was n't in their ' jurisdiction ' - a statement she would learn was completely untrue years later			1
he referred @entity1 to another administrator , @entity180 , who was a bit more understanding			2
@entity182 arranged for her to be interviewed by a student journalist to write about the attack for the campus paper and continued to be a personal ally throughout the rest of her college career			0
she also helped @entity1 tell her story to campus police captain @entity190 , who promised to investigate the attack			2
' nothing ever came of the “ investigation			0
” i called @entity190 ’s office regularly , and i was routinely told someone would get back to me ... no one ever called me back			0
' @entity1 graduated from @entity3 in 1988 with a degree in @entity53 literature , but no justice for her crime			1
short sentence : @entity160 ( pictured ) only spent less than six months in prison , because his 10 year sentence was mostly suspended her case took an unexpected turn in september 2005 though , when her rapist sent her an apology letter , as part of his @entity211 program			1
she took the letter to the @entity176 and it was then that she learned that local authorities did indeed have the power to investigate crimes at the fraternity and that there is no statue of limitations on rape in @entity56			2
@entity148 was arrested in january 2006 and charged with two felony counts of rape			2
during the grand jury process , @entity1 learned that @entity148 was n't the only man who violated her that night			2
private investigators hired by @entity148 's defense attorneys tracked down two men who also allegedly raped her and when they appeared before the jury , they pleaded the @entity229 to every question			2
' police contacted dozens of witnesses from that night			0
many declined to be interviewed			0
the bonds of @entity2 brotherhood were too strong to break			2
there were witnesses who are sons of powerful men ; congressmen , senators , captains of industry			0
it was — and is — heartbreaking			0
' @entity148 struck a plea deal with prosecutors two weeks before his case was set to go to trial , in which the rape charges were dropped and instead he pleaded guilty to a single charge of aggravated sexual battery			0
he was sentenced to 10 years in prison , but only ended up serving less than six months because most of the sentence was suspended			0
however , @entity1 believes that justice was served and says she 's forgiven @entity148 for the vile crime he committed against her			1
' i forgave @entity148 decades ago ...			0
i do not forgive those who saw the attacks and have refused to cooperate with law enforcement			0
these are men who now have wives and children , and their silence so many years later shows how morally bankrupt they remain			0
i can not begin to understand it , ' she says			0
allies : @entity1 says former @entity267 ( left ) helped her deal with the rape in college , and that @entity54 chief of police @entity271 ( right ) helped her bring her attacker to justice in 2006 @entity1 adds that she is glad she came forward and had her rapist tried , because it gives other rape victims like her hope of justice			1
' when i think of the many rape victims who never come forward , who have been silenced in the same fashion , i am saddened			0
when colleges and universities systematically lie to victims and shuttle them toward administrators whose jobs depend upon protecting the good names of their employers , all of us lose			0
' but i fought , and i fought hard , so that others after me have hope , and a chance			0
' @entity1 spoke out earlier this month to defend @entity33 's story to @entity294 , repeating the statistic that false rape stories are extremely rare ' wholesale doubt or dismissal of a rape account because it sounds “ too bad to be true ” is ridiculous			1
is it easier to believe a rape by a single stranger upon a woman in a dark alley ? what about marital rape ? what if a prostitute is raped ? just how bad was it ? we should not have a rape continuum as part of the dialogue , ever			2
' forgiveness : @entity1 says she 's forgiven her rapist , but not the men who witnessed the attack and said nothing author : she has written a book about the traumatic incident titled ' @entity32 '			1
pictured on the right in a photo posted to @entity324			0
