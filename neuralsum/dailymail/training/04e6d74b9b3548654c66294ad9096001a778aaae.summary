' we know @entity15 real estate is really strong , but in some of these areas where you are seeing million dollar price tags , like @entity97 and @entity98 , you are a long way from the @entity19 and a long way from the water , ' said @entity84 senior researcher @entity101			0
family - friendly suburb @entity48 drew potential buyers to the suburb , with the absence of high - rise buildings being a potential attraction for those looking to invest in a first time home and looking long term , reported @entity111			0
14 mchenry street in @entity112 may not look like much , but for many millionaire club suburbs , it 's all about location , location , location ... which this property has in spades 38 vineyard street in @entity120 is a tidy weatherboard house with only three bedrooms , another surprising property expected to fetch in excess of $ 1 million when it goes under the hammer this weekend suburbs which border other exclusive areas proved to be no surprise , with @entity64 suburbs @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 in the @entity66 and @entity66 of the city making the cut			1
