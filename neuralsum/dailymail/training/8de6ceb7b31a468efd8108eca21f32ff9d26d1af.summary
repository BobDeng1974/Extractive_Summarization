@entity1 militants have vowed online to take over @entity2 - and ' throw homosexuals off the leaning tower of pizza '			1
in the message , posted by a @entity10 account linked to the terror group , the @entity7 supporter also threatens to bring sharia law to the @entity14 capital			1
it comes just days after masked jihadists warned of their intention to conquer the city in a video that showed the mass beheading of 21 @entity21 in @entity22			2
but rather than spark widespread panic , the threats have triggered a flood of mocking responses - with dozens taking to social media to make fun of the jihadists and their takeover plans			1
hapless : above , the tweets posted today by an account linked to the @entity34			2
in them , the user threatens to bring shariah law to @entity2 and ' use your leaning tower of pizza to throw off homosexual ' in the threat posted today , @entity10 user @entity42 , who openly publicises @entity7 activity , wrote : ' @entity45 with slaughter '			1
the message was soon followed by one that read : ' # @entity45 , we will conquer & establish the justice of # shariah			2
we will use your leaning tower of pizza to throw off homosexual '			1
the terrorists have previously thrown men off of buildings for ' being gay '			0
earlier this year , images emerged that appeared to show militants hurling one man off a building in the town of @entity65 in @entity66 as supposed punishment for having a ‘ homosexual affair ’			0
this most recent threat appears to indicate the terrorists intend to bring their barbaric practices to @entity71 - and plan to repeat the horrific scenes off the @entity73			0
it appears the tweeter is unaware the tower is in @entity77 , not @entity2			2
the hashtag # @entity45 has been used by @entity34 supporters to discuss plans to reach @entity2 after the city was mentioned in a sickening video released earlier this week			1
sickening : the threats come just days after masked @entity7 jihadists warned of their intention to conquer the city in a video that showed the mass beheading of 21 @entity21 in @entity22			1
above , a still from the brutal clip the footage , which lasts five minutes , shows the @entity90 dressed in jumpsuits being marched one by one along a lonely beach , each held by a fighter clad in black			0
the captives , their faces uncovered , are made to kneel before being forced to lie down			0
the masked jihadists then behead them simultaneously			0
in the video , one of the militants warned : ' today we are south of @entity2			2
we will conquer @entity2 with @entity104 ’s permission			1
' they claimed their prisoners had been beheaded in @entity22 - just 220 miles south of @entity14			0
in the wake of the threat , @entity14 security chiefs have approved plans to put 4,800 soldiers on the country 's streets and post them to ' sensitive sites ' to help prevent terrorist attacks			0
response : rather than spark widespread panic , the threats have triggered a flood of mocking responses - with dozens taking to social media to make fun of the jihadists and their takeover plans reports claim 500 will be deployed in @entity2 - where soldiers are already guarding diplomatic residences , synagogues and @entity131 schools			1
the troops are also expected to be deployed at tourist venues such as archaeological sites and monuments			0
meanwhile , the commander of @entity139 's 110 - man @entity137 said his forces are ready to defend @entity141 if @entity7 attempt a strike			0
but some experts have claimed that ' @entity2 ' could be being used as a symbolic term by the terrorists , and might refer to the @entity146 , @entity147 , or the @entity148 as a whole			0
mocking : some @entity150 offered advice to @entity7 - with some warning them against travelling in rush - hour traffic ( top ) and another pointing out that the city already has a list of problems to address ( above ) unconvinced @entity10 users have taken to the social networking site to undermine @entity7 threats with a number of tweets and mocking memes			1
some played on the city 's history as the home of fearsome warriors , with one user posting an image of @entity170 in gladiator with the message ' so you are coming to @entity2 , let me entertain you '			2
another posted a cartoon of men dressed in armour and shields with the caption ' @entity14 special units alerted to the threat of @entity7 ... ' a number of @entity150 took the opportunity to offer advice to @entity7 - with some warning them against travelling in rush - hour traffic and others pointing out there may be glass on the street			1
and one young woman politely asked the terrorists to stay at home , saying that the city already had a ' long list ' of problems that needed to be fixed .			0
