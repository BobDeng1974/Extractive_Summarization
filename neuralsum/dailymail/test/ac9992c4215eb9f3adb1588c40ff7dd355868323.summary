it is no secret that when a gang member is sentenced to prison , he does n't leave that life behind			2
among the state of @entity8 's approximately 162,000 inmates , the most dangerous serve their time in @entity11 maximum - security facilities where it is estimated as much as 97 per cent are gang affiliated			1
the gangs rule life behind the cement walls the same way as out on the streets , but for those who choose to leave the criminal families behind , the @entity19 offers a chance at a different way of living on the inside			0
new order : @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , @entity28 ( @entity29 - @entity8 ) , @entity30 ( @entity31 ) and @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , have spent collectively 55 years hating one another			2
in the past , standing next to each other would have meant kill or be killed			0
now , all four reside in a @entity37 new unit : a former member of an @entity41 gang walks through the prison yard in the @entity43 at the @entity19 , a section of the prison where gang behaviour is banned mixing it up : inmates of different races and gang backgrounds play basketball together in the @entity37 yard under the supervision of correctional officers in stark contrast to the segregation that generally governs prison life since 1999 , the @entity19 has seen a dramatic increase in requests from inmates seeking special protection for dropping out of prison gangs , and as a result has set up several @entity64			1
a @entity37 can be found inside @entity11 maximum - security facilities and is set to protect former members from the gangs , some of the more prominent being the @entity68 , @entity41 and rival hispanic gangs @entity70 from @entity71 and the @entity72 from the south			1
the exclusive units inside @entity37 provide a safer environment , free from gang activity , and the transition out of gang membership is dramatic			1
as these images show , inmates of different races and gang affiliations mix during their daily exercise and in the cafeteria during lunch			0
prisoners who would previously have killed each other on sight due to their race or gang , now jokily tackle each other during a friendly basketball game on the @entity37 's court			0
building bridges : an @entity29 ( southern @entity8 ) gang member exercises with former members of the @entity70 ( northern @entity8 ) in the the @entity37			1
historically , members of these two rival gangs would have killed each other on sight the other side of things : prisoners who still remain in the ' normal ' parts of the prison , outside the @entity37 , refuse to exercise simultaneously , inmates alternate their workout routines until members of other gangs race have finished former leader : @entity112 , was one of the most feared enforcers for the @entity70 ( @entity71 ) prison gang			1
he explains how , in his world he was the self - proclaimed @entity115 ; his word determined who lived or died			0
after spending almost 16 years in solitary confinement , he chose to drop out and now resides in a @entity37 dining together : inmates share meals in a cafeteria setting , which is a freedom allowed in @entity64 one of them is @entity112 , formerly one of the most feared enforcers for the @entity70			2
in his world , he was the self - proclaimed @entity115 - his word determined who lived or died			0
after spending almost 16 years in solitary confinement for his gang leadership , he says lost respect for the collective decision - making and chose to drop out			0
he now resides in the @entity37 , where corrections officers , as well as inmates , report a considerable reduction in racial violence and segregation			1
although inmates of the @entity37 are no longer gang affiliated or validated , the fact remains that they are some of the most hardened and dangerous men behind bars			1
some racial segregation is still self - imposed by the inmates , and they are routinely stripped and undergo full - body cavity searches for weapons and narcotics			1
a gang dropout in the @entity43 participates in a ' joint venture program , ' a collaboration between the prison and a private sector company			0
outside of @entity37 , inmates with jobs earn 20 cents an hour			0
those who have renounced gang membership have the opportunity to work for the federal minimum wage			0
the money he earns is distributed among his family , the family of the man he murdered , personal savings , and an inmates ' fund break with tradition : free of body shackles , inmates in a @entity37 walk to the prison yard for their daily exercise still issues : several packets of black tar heroin , a razor blade , a homemade syringe , and a cooking spoon were wrapped in artwork			2
the contraband was probably smuggled into the @entity37 in the anal cavity of a visitor and passed to an inmate for those living outside the @entity37 , old rules apply			0
every gang has a hierarchy , and members and affiliates follow orders from the leaders who are deemed ' validated ' by outside powers			0
only the most feared and brutally confident inmates within a @entity11 prison reach validation status			2
leaders of gang hierarchy manage daily operations such as murders , assaults and narcotic trafficking inside the prison			0
with racial tensions running high at @entity11 facilities , validated gang members and other residents of @entity200 spend their exercise time in 15ftx7ft cages , called ' dog runs			1
' even though inmates are segregated and separated by the cages , they refuse to exercise simultaneously			0
instead , inmates alternate their workout routines , waiting until members of rival gangs have finished			1
two worlds - one prison : handcuffs are removed from an inmate housed in a vertical cage in the @entity215 in preparation for a full cavity search at the @entity218 , left , and right ; an inmate receives a haircut in a @entity37 strict rules : until he passes three bowel movements , this inmate , suspected of hiding a weapon or drugs in his anal cavity , is confined in a special @entity215 holding cell containing nothing more than a bare mattress in @entity218 two worlds on the inside : a prisoner known as ' @entity233 ' is standing in an @entity235 cell in @entity218			1
he is subject to 22 - hour - per - day solitary confinement for the alleged murder of a rival prison gang member , and right , are two former members of the of the @entity72 ( @entity8 ) an inmate waits in a holding cage to be transported to his solitary confinement cell in @entity218			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) houses approximately 162,000 inmates , the most dangerous of whom serve their time in @entity11 facilities			2

these men reside in a special prison unit set up inside maximum - security facilities to protect gang drop - outs
this @entity37 in a @entity8 prison forces former members of rival gangs to mix
although there is still some self - imposed racial segregation among inmates , the unit is free from gang activity
up to 97 per cent of @entity11 maximum - security inmates in @entity8 are gang affiliated
