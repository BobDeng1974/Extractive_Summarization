doctors at @entity1 spent almost an hour in surgery trying to reduce swelling on @entity5 cricketer @entity4 ' brain after he was struck with a cricket ball			1
the hospital 's spokesman @entity7 likened @entity4 ' condition to someone who had been ' king hit '			1
@entity4 was severely injured during day one of the @entity12 at @entity13 on tuesday			1
' the operation was quick , less than an hour to alleviate swelling on the brain			2
' it 's really similar to a king hit situation where you have bleeding on the brain , what 's called a subdural haematoma			1
' in the case of a king hit , it 's the pavement you often fall back and sustain a fracture on the skull			2
@entity1 spokesman @entity7 likened @entity4 ' condition to someone who had been ' king hit ' ' depending on the damage that does or what it hits - a nerve or a vessel - there 's a real range of injury severity			1
' mr @entity7 said medical officers intubated @entity4 at the scene and he was also placed in an induced coma			1
intubation involves a tube being inserted into a patient 's trachea to help them breathe easier			0
' now it 's just a waiting game as surgeons wait for the swelling on his brain to go down , ' mr @entity7 said			1
it could be 24 to 48 hours before the extent of @entity4 ' injuries are known			0
in photographs , a cricket ball is seen hitting @entity4 in the back of the head , which is not covered by his helmet			0
mr @entity7 said @entity4 had bleeding on the brain and now @entity66 president @entity65 said being hit by a cricket ball at high speeds could leave someone with a range of injuries , including those that ended in a concussion			1
he said injuries caused by a cricket ball were uncommon because of helmets like the one @entity4 was wearing			2
dr @entity65 said the concern did not lie with a ball causing external injuries but with it fracturing the skull , which protects the brain inside and prevent internal injuries			0
he said this could cause mild or severe injuries as well as bruising the brain and the sooner it was treated the better , saying ' time is of the essence '			0
' at the other end of the spectrum the thing people will be worried about is bleeds on the brain , ' he told the @entity94			0
' if there is any major bleeding inside the brain you have the issue of the build - up of blood within the skull , and that blood causes pressure on the brain which can cause further injury			2
' basically you are squeezing the cells , but that increased pressure also prevents the oxygenated blood getting into the brain , and the venous blood from flowing out			0
' injuries of this nature are more commonly a result of road accidents or at times alcohol - related violence .			0
