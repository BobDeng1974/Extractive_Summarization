the skeleton of a new species of giant predatory bird that terrorised the @entity3 3.5 million years ago has been discovered and is helping to reveal how these creatures would have sounded			1
palaeontologists say the four feet ( 1.2 metres ) tall bird is the most complete skeletons of a ' terror bird ' - a group of flightless prehistoric meat - eating birds - to be discovered			1
the @entity12 bird has been named @entity13 scagliai - meaning @entity15 's @entity14 after one of @entity18 's famous naturalists @entity15			1
they say that while it had a terrifying apperance , its hearing was probably below average compared to birds living today			2
a giant prehistoric ‘ terror bird ’ - once thought to have been a ruthless predator which snapped the necks of mammals with its enormous beak - was actually a vegetarian , according to one study			1
the two - metre gastornis was a flightless creature which lived in @entity46 between 40 and 55 million years ago			0
because of its size and ominous appearance , it was thought to be a top carnivore			0
but a team of @entity53 researchers , who studied fossilised remains of the beasts found in a former open cast coal mine , say they believe it was actually not a meat eater			2
palaeontologists in the @entity60 have also found footprints believed to belong to the @entity12 cousin of gastornis , and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws , used to grapple prey , that might be expected of a raptor			1
also , the bird ’s sheer size and inability to move fast made some believe it could n’t have preyed on early mammals - though others claim it might have ambushed them			2
they claim that the animal probably also had a limited vocal range that was quite low frequency			2
it has also raised the prospect that the bird may have even used low frequency sounds to help detect its prey			2
dr @entity81 , a palaeontologist at the @entity82 in @entity83 and the @entity84 in @entity18 , said : ' the mean hearing estimated for this terror bird was below the average for living birds			1
' this seems to indicate that @entity90 may have had a narrow , low vocalization frequency range , presumably used for intraspecific acoustic communication or prey detection			2
' terror birds , or phorusracids as they are also known , were a group of carnivorous birds that grew up to 10 feet tall and had large hooked beaks			1
they were the dominant predators in @entity12 during the @entity101 age which started with the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			0
although smaller than some of the species discovered , @entity20 , was one of the last terror birds to prowl the @entity3 before they died out around 2.5 million years ago			1
it was discovered by @entity108 , from the @entity109 , along with @entity110 and @entity111 at @entity112 south of @entity114 city in the @entity115 of @entity18 in 2010			1
scientists used 3d scanning of the long skull of @entity119 ( above ) to examine its hearing ability dr @entity15 is the grandson of @entity121 who was director of the museum between 1940 and 1980			1
due to incoming tides which were damaging the cliff , the team had to work quickly to excavate the entire fossil in one day			0
the fossilised skeleton ( above ) was found in a cliff on a beach south of @entity114 city in @entity18 however , despite this they were able to retrieve a skeleton that is around 90 per cent complete			1
in a study published in the @entity136 , the researchers were able to reconstruct the structure of the bird 's inner ear using 3d computed tomography			1
they found that @entity90 would have had an average hearing range of around @entity142 and a sensitivity of around @entity144			1
the human ear , by contrast , can detect sounds with frequencies between @entity149 and @entity150 , but is best at around 4,000 - @entity151			0
this suggests that @entity90 would have been better at detecting lower frequency sounds than humans are			0
dr @entity81 told @entity156 the bird had a tracheobronchial syrinx - the structure that produces sound in birds - that was mainly made of cartilage and so it did not survived			0
he said : ' it is not possible then through this to know exactly what kind of sounds terror birds were capable of produce			0
' however , based on the hearing frequencies that we know that they were able to hear , it is possible to state that @entity13 may have produced sound of low frequency			0
' the researchers have also been able to better understand the some of the birds other features based on the palate and bones around the eye that were also preserved			0
dr @entity81 said the bird would have had powerful muscles around its jaws but they were still conducting studies on the eyes to discover whether the bird was active during the day , at night or in the twilight hours			0
@entity112 ( above ) near @entity114 in @entity18 where the fossil was found has strong tides that threatened to wash the skeleton away forcing palaeontologists to work fast to excavate it to save it from harm he said : ' the palate is a big area of jaw muscle attacment in birds			1
so , we are able to state how much developed were some of the jaw muscles in @entity199			0
' the sclerotic ring will give us an idea of the eye shape and size			0
this will allow us to infer if terror birds were diurnal , nocturnal or crepuscular			0
' he added that the fossil may also help scientists unpick what caused the giant birds to eventually die out			0
he said : ' the discovery of this species reveals that terror birds were more diverse in the @entity214 than previously thought			1
' it will allow us to review the hypothesis about the decline and extinction of this fascinating group of birds			0
' dr @entity222 , another author of the study at @entity18 's @entity224 in @entity83 , added : ' the discovery of this new species provides new insights for studying the anatomy and phylogeny of phorusrhacids and a better understanding of this group 's diversification			2

the four feet tall species of terror bird has been named @entity119
it was discovered in a *crumpling* cliff on a beach close to @entity114 city
palaeontologists say it is the most complete terror bird skeleton ever found
they have used @entity246 to reconstruct the bird 's range of hearing
