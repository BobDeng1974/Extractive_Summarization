it is one of the most prestigious public schools in @entity3 , with the distinctive black blazers of its pupils a familiar sight in the @entity9 borough of @entity10			2
but because of a worrying wave of street robberies in the area , the boys from @entity12 have been banned from displaying their uniform outside the school gates – and parents at the £ 22,000 - a - year establishment have been urged to buy hooded tops for their sons so they blend in more easily with the local youths			1
it is understood that criminal gangs have been targeting the pupils in the belief that they are likely to be carrying expensive smartphones			1
