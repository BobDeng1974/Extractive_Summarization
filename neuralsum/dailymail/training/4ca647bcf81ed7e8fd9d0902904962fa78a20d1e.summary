by @entity0 published : 12:49 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 20 july 2012 shyly peeking out from the shelter and safety of their den , four rare newborn @entity2 lions had their first glimpse of the @entity9 sunshine as excited staff at @entity11 in @entity12 unveiled their new mane attraction			1
the cute cubs , born on may 15 , stayed close to their proud mum @entity15 as they took in the sights of the @entity12 outdoors			1
the zoo kept the arrival under wraps until the cubs had survived the critical first weeks of their lives			2
the newborn cubs peer out of their den at @entity11 where they were born in may as part of an endangered species programme @entity25 : the shaggy siblings stick together as they step into the sun @entity15 will mother her babies until they are at least a year old , before they are sent to other zoos as part of an endangered species programme			1
keepers are keeping their distance for now to allow the family to bond , so it will be a while before they can announce the sex of each cub			0
the zoo 's operations director and curator of mammals @entity38 said : ' we have been letting her get on with being a new mum - so far she seems to be doing really well			0
' we are cautiously excited			0
if she is successful then it will be thanks to a lot of care and attention from the keepers			0
it is very good news for the species			2
' @entity15 was born at @entity11 in 2003 while dad @entity55 was born in 2004 at @entity57 's @entity56			1
the pair have attempted to breed before but this is their first success - a cub had to be put down in june 2011 after it was found to have spinal defects			0
the species is distinct from their african lion relatives with a shaggier coat , lighter colour and folds of skin on the belly			2
mother 's pride : the rare cubs have made it through the critical first weeks of life and are sure to be the mane attraction when they are revealed to the public a tentative tail first ! asiatic lions are notoriously shy and @entity11 's latest arrivals were reluctant to leave the safety of the den where they were born they enjoy socialising but live in smaller prides than their @entity87 cousins and tend to hunt without the adult male of the group , feeding on wild antelope , deer , pigs and cattle			1
asiatic lions once joined @entity96 gladiators in fights in the @entity98 but are now fighting off the threat of extinction from hunting and the destruction of their habitat			0
the endangered lions are only found in the wild in the @entity107 and @entity108 in @entity109 say they are rapidly outgrowing their home there and experts have drawn up plans to relocate the animals to the neighbouring state of @entity115			1
but the @entity117 state government have refused permission for the move , with critics accusing them of wanting to protect the income the state receives from tourists wanting to admire the magnificent animals			2
experts estimate their numbers as roughly 411 big cats , including 150 adults			0
captive lions can live to be 24 - years - old while their wild counterparts have a life expectancy of 17 - 18 years			0
the last @entity2 lion cubs to be born in the @entity9 were an early festive present for @entity134 in 2010 as twins @entity136 and @entity137 arrived on christmas eve to mum @entity138 and father @entity139 .			1

@entity11 welcomes four *unbearably* cute @entity2 lion cubs as part of endangered animals breeding programme
only around *400* of the species left in the wild
