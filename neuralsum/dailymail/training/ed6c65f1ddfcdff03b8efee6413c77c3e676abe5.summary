eternal youth could be one step closer following the successful transformation of old human cells into young ones			2
the process increases the length of the ' telomeres ' , which are the protective caps on the end of chromosomes that impact ageing and disease			1
researchers in the @entity13 say the technique could extend human life and provide new hope for battling diseases that arise from old age			1
the process increases the length of the ' telomeres ' to keep cells healthy telomeres - often described as being like the plastic caps on the end of shoelaces â€“ help keep @entity26 healthy			1
these protective end caps become shorter with each dna replication , and eventually are no longer able to protect @entity26 from sustaining damage and mutations , causing people to age			2
in young people , telomeres are about 8,000 - 10,000 organic molecules , or nucleotides , long			0
' now we have found a way to lengthen human telomeres by as much as 1,000 nucleotides , turning back the internal clock in these cells by the equivalent of many years of human life , ' said @entity54 of @entity55			1
the breakthrough could allow scientists to generate large numbers of cells that could create to an effective anti-aging drug and help keep older people active to make the discovery , researchers used modified messenger @entity65 to extend the telomeres			1
telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of the strands of @entity26 called chromosomes , which house our genomes			1
in young humans , telomeres are about 8,000 - 10,000 nucleotides long			0
they shorten with each cell division , however , and when they reach a critical length the cell stops dividing or dies			0
this internal ' clock ' makes it difficult to keep most cells growing in a laboratory for more than a few cell doublings			0
@entity65 carries instructions from genes in the @entity26 to the cell 's protein - making factories			0
the rna used in this experiment contained the coding sequence for @entity92 - the active component of a naturally occurring enzyme called telomerase			0
when the cells are treated , they behave as if they are younger and multiply quickly rather than dying			1
' one day it may be possible to target muscle stem cells in a patient with @entity103 muscular dystrophy , for example , to extend their telomeres , ' said dr @entity54			2
' there are also implications for treating conditions of aging , such as diabetes and heart disease			0
' this has really opened the doors to consider all types of potential uses of this therapy			0
' the researchers also hope that the method will be able to allow scientists to generate large numbers of cells that could someday lead to an effective anti-aging drug .			2

@entity55 has found a way to increase the length of telomeres
these are the protective caps on chromosomes that keep dna healthy
to make the discovery , researchers used modified messenger rna
this caused cells to behave as if they are younger and multiply quickly
it could also provide hope for battling the illnesses such as diabetes
