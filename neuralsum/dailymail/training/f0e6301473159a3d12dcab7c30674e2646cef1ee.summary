three death row inmates were last night scheduled to be executed in @entity1 despite a row over the use of untested drugs in lethal injections			1
the killers are the first scheduled to die since a botched execution in april was caused by an untried cocktail of chemicals			0
they are due to be put to death in three states over a 24 - hour period but authorities are refusing to say where they have obtained the drugs			1
campaigners have criticised the secretive process under which officials have got hold of drugs from unnamed , loosely regulated pharmacies after other companies withdrew their supplies			0
and lawyers for the condemned men say subjecting them to a traumatic ordeal could breach the @entity1 constitution ’s ban on ‘ cruel and unusual punishment ’			2
however , the killings are due to go ahead unless they are given clemency at the last minute			0
executions in @entity1 had been put on hold following the bungled attempt , a highly unusual break for a country that puts more people to death than any other @entity40 nation			2
nine killings were delayed after an inmate eventually died of a heart attack 43 minutes after he was injected with an untested cocktail of drugs in @entity46			1
an investigation later found that prison guards had put the needle into a vein in @entity52 ’s groin but failed to notice when it started leaking , even though he moaned and struggled violently on the gurney			0
in january , an @entity56 prison also bungled the death of murderer and rapist @entity59 , 53 , after using two drugs normally used in colonoscopies			2
@entity62 was the first due to die last night in @entity63 , followed by @entity64 today in @entity65 , although judges have temporarily granted a delay			1
@entity68 is set to be put to death tonight in @entity70			1
death penalty expert @entity71 , of @entity73 , said that after previous botched executions ‘ everyone is going to be watching very closely ’			1
@entity76 , of the @entity77 , said the debate could be a ‘ turning point ’ over capital punishment as people become ‘ disgusted ’			0
@entity63 and @entity65 plan to use the single drug pentobarbital , a sedative , in executions			1
@entity70 uses a combination of midazolam hydrochloride , vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride			0
campaigners have challenged the three states ’ refusal to divulge where exactly the drugs are from but state courts have ruled the secrecy is legal			0
prisons have had to find alternatives after the makers of sodium thiopental , long used in @entity1 executions , stopped supplying it for that purpose in 2011 after being targeted by protesters .			0

executions the first to go ahead since botched lethal injection left prisoner *writhing* in *agony* for 40 minutes before suffering *massive* heart attack
states planning the executions - @entity70 , @entity63 and @entity65 - refuse to say where they get lethal injection drugs from or if they have been tested
death penalty *supporters* say men are getting what they *deserve* as punishment for horrific crimes which *include* murder and rape
