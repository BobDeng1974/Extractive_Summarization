by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 inventor is hoping to turn the world of the humble umbrella on its head after designing one that folds inwards to stop water dripping onto the floor			2
rather than creating pools of rainwater when it is put away , like normal umbrellas , the @entity11 folds the opposite way , collecting drips inside it			2
it also solves the problem of poking passers - by in the head with an umbrella 's spokes because it opens from the top rather than the bottom			1
mr @entity35 , an aeronautical engineer , came up with the idea after his mother - in - law complained her regular umbrella had dripped all over the floor of her house			2
he has been accused of trying to reinvent the wheel - but he claims his invention could be the future for the much - needed umbrella			0
the device is now in the final design process before being put into production in a few months ' time and is expected to cost around £ 45 ( $ 75 )			1
it also solves the problem of poking passers - by in the head ( pictured ) with an umbrella 's spokes because it opens from the top rather than the bottom			1
according to inventor , @entity35 , users can stay dry for longer rather than creating pools of rainwater when it is put away like normal umbrellas , this device folds the opposite way , collecting drips inside it ( pictured ) the @entity11 turns inside out leaving the dry side of the canopy on the outside			1
to close the umbrella , users pull it up , instead of pulling it down , as is the case with a normal brolly			0
this captures the dripping water within so it does n't make the surroundings wet			0
the website claims it does this by using ' patented ' folds that change the way the umbrella opens and closes it will cost around £ 45 ( $ 75 ) when it is launched later this year			1
mr @entity35 , 61 , from @entity91 , @entity92 , said : ' a number of years ago my mother - in - law was walking into her house from the rain with her umbrella			1
' she put it down as she came into the house and stood it up on its end like normal but it dripped water all over her floor			0
' the @entity11 turns inside out leaving the dry side of the canopy on the outside			2
to close the umbrella you pull it up , instead of pulling it down as is the case with a normal brolly			0
' i 'm an engineer by trade and it got me thinking about what i could do to remedy the problem , ' said mr @entity35			2
' the initial idea to turn the conventional design upside down so that it closes in on itself came pretty quickly , but it took me some time to work out how i was going to do it			0
by putting their umbrellas down once they are inside a car , users can avoid damage by strong gusts of wind the @entity11 ( pictured ) is expected to cost £ 45 ( $ 75 ) when it is launched later this year ' @entity11 wo n't drip on your floor once you come in out of the rain and , unlike normal brollies , you do n't have to lift it way above people 's heads to put it up			1
' it wo n't poke people in the face , you can put it down once you 're sat inside a car to make sure you stay dry for longer , and it ca n't be blown inside out by the wind because it 's already inside out			0
' umbrellas have been around for 3,000 years and some people have said i 'm trying to reinvent the wheel but what i 'm actually doing is evolving a design which is great but has flaws			0
' the @entity11 has the same iconic look as a normal umbrella but it resolves some of the problems that have beset umbrellas for millennia			0
' the ' @entity11 wo n't drip on your floor once the user comes in out of the rain , and unlike normal brollies you do n't have to lift it way above people 's heads to put it up , ' said inventor @entity35 ( pictured ) to close the @entity11 ( pictured left ) users pull it up , instead of pulling it down , as is the case with a conventional brolly ( pictured right )			1

device was invented by 61 - year - old @entity35 from @entity92
*dubbed* the @entity11 , it also avoids poking passers - by in the head
it closes and opens in reverse , helping trap the water on the inside
it is expected to go into production in a few months and will cost £ 45 ( $ 75 )
