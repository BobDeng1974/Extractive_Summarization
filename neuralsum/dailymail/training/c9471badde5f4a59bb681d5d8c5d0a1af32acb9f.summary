by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 07:24 est , 6 march 2014 as the firm gears up to finally release its flying car next year , engineers from @entity4 - based @entity3 are set to reveal how the @entity7 was created			1
during a webinar , scheduled to take place later today , @entity8 and @entity9 will discuss the design and development process , as well as talk about the challenges involved in building an aircraft that can also be driven on land			2
the transition took part in two 20 - minute flight demonstrations in july and is still going through tests needed to earn it federal certification			1
the online event is being hosted by @entity25 and will begin at 1pm est ( 6pm gmt )			1
the online event is being hosted by @entity25 and will begin at 1pm est ( 6pm gmt ) today the transition can reach speeds of around 70 miles per hour on the road and 115 in the air			1
it flies using a 23 - gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 gallons per hour in the air			0
on the ground , it gets 35 miles per gallon			0
the transition has rear - wheel drive when on the road			2
it comes with two passenger airbags , and a full - vehicle parachute			2
the flying car is 2m tall , 2.3m wide and 6m long with a wingspan of 8m			1
the transition vehicle is part - sedan , part - private jet and is due to go on sale as early as 2015 , although it may be released in 2016			1
it has been in development for seven years and during flight testing in 2012 , it successfully flew for eight minutes			2
the vehicle was then driven around the @entity56 air show in july before transitioning into the jet and taking off on two 20 - minute flight demonstrations			1
the @entity3 has two seats , four wheels and wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car			2
it can carry two people , including the pilot , plus luggage and runs on unleaded petrol			0
in a statement , the company said : ' developing a practical vehicle that simultaneously satisfies road and aircraft regulations to become a true ' flying car ' presents significant engineering challenges			1
' yet this is what the team at @entity3 has achieved with their proof - of - concept vehicle , which has been flying and driving for the past 2 years			1
' in the webinar , @entity3 will discuss the design process for the composite structure of the @entity7 airframe and the role and benefits of physics based simulation			1
' in a statement , the company said : ' in the webinar , @entity3 will discuss the design process for the composite structure of the @entity7 airframe and the role and benefits of physics based simulation ' @entity97 , @entity3 's chief test pilot and flight test coordinator is pictured driving the transition vehicle			1
the part - sedan , part - private jet has been in development for seven years and is still going through tests need to achieve federal certification @entity3 has already pushed back the launch once			1
in 2012 , the company said it would have to delay deliveries due to design challenges and problems with parts suppliers			0
transition is considered to be a light sports plane by the @entity114 , as well as being a road car			2
owners will have to have pilot 's licenses , and will need to pass a test , plus complete 20 hours of flying time to be able to fly the car			1
the transition made its first public flights , pictured , soaring for a total of 40 minutes over the @entity56 aviation show in @entity124 in july the transition , pictured , can reach speeds of around 70 miles per hour on the road and 115 in the air			2
it flies using a 23 - gallon tank of automotive fuel and burns 5 gallons per hour in the air			0
the flying car is 2m tall , 2.3m wide and 6m long with a wingspan , pictured , of 8m the transition 's cockpit , pictured , has two seats and four wheels			1
it has wings that fold up so it can be driven like a car and can carry luggage			0
the vehicle runs on unleaded petrol despite the advances in technology the transition demonstrates , critics have said that it is still not the vision of flying cars seen in many sci - fi films			1
to answer these critics , @entity3 also released designs for a @entity155 - @entity154 of its transition range in may last year			1
the @entity159 model will be small enough to fit in a garage and wo n't need a runway to take off			0
whereas the transition requires a runway , the @entity159 can take off from a vertical position because of motorised rotors on the wings			0
this shot was taken by a camera fixed to one of the @entity7 's wing during its public flight over @entity124			2
the 20 - minute demonstrations included flight manoeuvres over the show centre , converting from airplane to car , and driving along the flight line the transition flying car , built by @entity3 , making a banking turn in the sky above @entity4			1
the car flew for eight minutes at 1,400 feet during test flights last year , before completing the public flights in @entity124 in july these rotors will work in a similar way to helicopter rotors			0
being able to take off from standstill means owners will be able to go from the road to the air straight from their driveways , car parks and even when stuck in traffic			0
although you will still need at least 100 ft in diameter in order to open the wings			0
according to @entity3 , the vehicle will carry four people ' in car - like comfort '			1
it is expected to be able to fly , nonstop , for 500 miles			0
this shot shows the transition plane switching from drive mode to fly mode			0
the wings fold into the side of the car , built from a @entity211 design			0
drivers can only take off in the transition from a runway			0
the transition has a maximum flight speed of 115mph a @entity3 test pilot fills up the transition flying car with petrol			1
the transition can hold 23 gallons of usable fuel and uses 5 gallons per hour during flight			2
on the ground , it gets 35 miles per gallon when the @entity159 - a new flying car design announced by @entity4 - based firm @entity3 - is in drive mode , the wings fold into the side of the car and the rotors , which make it possible to take off in the @entity159 from standing still , also fold away and tuck into the chassis the @entity159 model has not been tested yet , and prices have n't been announced			1
@entity3 hopes to have working models of the @entity232 available for sale within eight to 12 years			2
like with the transition , pilots will need 20 hours of flying and a pilot 's licence to drive it , though			1
the flying car has always had a special place in the @entity243 imagination			2
inventors have been trying to make them since the 1930s , according to @entity247 , an airline industry analyst who owns @entity248 in @entity249 , @entity250			0
when the wings are folded away , the @entity159 will be small enough to fit in a single - car garage			0
@entity3 announced plans for the @entity159 today and is hoping it will be road - ready in 12 years when its not soaring in the air , the @entity7 's wings fold up , pictured , to make it a road - ready two - seat car but @entity247 thinks @entity3 has come closer than anyone to making the flying cars a reality			1
the government has already granted the company 's request to use special tyres and glass that are lighter than normal automotive ones , to make it easier for the vehicle to fly			0
the government has also temporarily exempted the transition from the requirement to equip vehicles with electronic stability control , which would add about six pounds to the vehicle			0
@entity247 said @entity3 was helped by the @entity114 's decision five years ago to create a separate set of standards for light sport aircraft			2
the standards govern the size and speed of the plane and licensing requirements for pilots , which are less restrictive than requirements for pilots of larger planes			0
inventors and engineers have been working on the flying car concept since the 1930s			1
here , a 1947 @entity291 is seen in flight the 1930s @entity293 , pictured , was the first simple flying car to successfully be produced			1
a total of five were built and flown @entity247 questions the size of the market for the transition			0
the general aviation market has been in decline for two decades , he said , largely because of fuel costs and the high cost of liability for manufacturers			0
also , fewer people are learning how to fly			0
' this is not going to be an inexpensive aircraft to produce or market , ' he said			0
' it has some uniqueness , and will get some sales , but the question is , could it ever be a profitable enterprise ? ' @entity247 sees the western @entity243 as the most likely market , where people could fly instead of driving long distances .			0

the *Â* *£* *166,000* ( *$* *279,000* ) transition is part - sedan , part - private jet
it is due to go on sale in 2015 from @entity4 - based firm @entity3
engineers will discuss the vehicle 's development during a webinar
event is being hosted by @entity25 and starts at 1pm est ( 6pm gmt )
