by @entity0 a @entity2 man who sent letters dusted with the poison ricin to president @entity5 and other officials has been sentenced to spend 25 years in prison			1
@entity8 was sentenced monday after telling the judge that he had changed his mind about wanting to withdraw his guilty plea in the case			1
in addition to 25 years in jail , @entity13 was also sentenced to five years of supervised release and remains in federal custody			1
changing stories : @entity8 initially entered a guilty plea , then tried to change it last week , but decided against that and was sentenced to 25 years in jail today @entity8 waived his right to appeal			1
he was n't fined or ordered to pay restitution because he does n't have enough money , federal prosecutor @entity24 said			0
the 42 - year - old @entity28 resident sent the letters to president @entity5 , @entity31 senator @entity31 and @entity2 judge @entity32 in what prosecutors have said was an elaborate plot to frame a rival , @entity37			1
poisoned letters addressed to @entity5 and @entity31 were intercepted before delivery , but one letter reached @entity32			0
@entity42 district judge @entity41 had already signaled that she intended to accept the original plea , and @entity24 said that @entity41 found the outcome to be balanced			0
‘ she found our agreement to be a fair sentence and one that represented the severity of the crime committed , ’ @entity24 said after the hearing			0
the 42 - year - old @entity28 man complicated matters on may 13 when he told @entity54 that he wanted to withdraw the plea agreement he made with federal prosecutors in january			0
rivals : @entity8 , a martial arts instructor ( left ) , tried framing his longtime enemy @entity37 ( right ) , an @entity60 , of sending the letters last spring in a half - hour speech , the former martial arts instructor told the judge that federal prosecutors lied when they said he made the poison and about finding his dna on a dust mask			1
he renewed accusations that @entity60 impersonator and entertainer @entity37 had committed the crimes			1
@entity37 was initially arrested by federal prosecutors but was abruptly released after officials found no physical evidence of ricin in his home			2
although he pointed the finger at @entity37 , @entity8 also argued last week that had only used castor beans to make a fertilizer that could n't hurt anyone , not a true form of the poison ricin			2
bound for bars : @entity8 sent the letters to @entity5 , @entity87 @entity31 sen. @entity31 and @entity2 judge @entity32 in what prosecutors have said was an elaborate plot to frame @entity37 ( pictured in april 2013 ) at the end of the may 13 hearing , judge @entity41 had told @entity8 to file a formal motion asking to withdraw his plea			2
a decision on that motion would have been up to the judge , but @entity8 had a change of heart and on friday , defense attorney @entity97 sent a letter to @entity41 saying his client would stick with the guilty plea			2
the prosecutor said he did n't know what prompted the reversal ‘ other than he changed his mind and did not want to withdraw the plea			0
’ pulling back the plea could have opened @entity107 to a possible life sentence as well as a longer sentence in a state court proceeding where he had pleaded guilty to fondling charges			0
state prosecutors have recommended that @entity8 serve his proposed 20 - year sentence in the unrelated fondling case at the same time he serves any penalty on the federal charges .			0

@entity119 has been sentenced to 25 years behind bars and five years *probation* after sending ricin - laced letters to *government* officials
tried framing his longtime rival , @entity60 impersonator @entity37 who was *briefly* jailed and then released
he originally entered a guilty plea then said he wanted to change it and have a chance of proving his *innocence* but did n't move forward with that
