@entity0 today insisted the world will not ' fall in ' if a @entity3 government takes spending back to the levels seen in 2002			1
the prime minister unveiled the @entity3 election priorities , including the deficit , jobs and housing but not the @entity10 or immigration , which are high up the list of voters ' concerns			1
but he argued that getting a grip on the nation 's finances was vital to ensure that ' not a penny will be cut from the @entity10 budget '			1
in a speech in @entity32 today , mr @entity0 sought to cast the general election in may as a choice between security and chaos			1
he urged voters not to pass on a crippling ' legacy of debt ' to their children and grandchildren			0
and he brushed off dire warnings from @entity41 about the impact of spending cuts , insisting it only meant a reduction of £ 1 for every £ 100 – something every family or business could cope with			2
the six election themes which the @entity50 will focus on are the deficit , jobs , taxes , education , home ownership and retirement			1
mr @entity0 said : ' we do n't just want to eliminate the current budget deficit , we want to clear the entire budget deficit and start running a surplus			1
' @entity61 would be ' back in the black ' by 2018 , using extra money raised from tax to start paying down the nation 's debts , he said			0
' and at the end of all this , i want people to be clear : day - to - day spending on public services will be the same in real terms as it was in 2002			1
' the world did n't fall in then ; it wo n't this time			2
and finally , as a country , we will be genuinely paying down our debt rather than increasing it			0
' we can get @entity61 back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure			0
' the @entity50 , in coalition with the @entity80 , had promised to have eradicated the deficit by now			2
latest polling shows that voters name the economy , health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family , with immigration a key concern for the country the absence of immigration and the @entity10 from the key @entity3 themes set out by @entity0 was seized on by rivals			1
labour leader @entity96 said that for mr @entity0 the @entity10 was the subject that ' dare not speak its name '			1
@entity100 @entity99 , @entity101 's migration spokesman , said : ' despite all his rhetoric last year , @entity0 's omission of immigration as a major topic during this year 's election is yet another example of the prime minister running away from debating the big issues			1
' but the prime minister said : ' these areas i am talking about are very directly related to people 's concerns about their lives and their security			1
' it 's about people 's jobs , people 's taxes , the homes they want to buy , the schools they want to send their children to , and their retirement			1
' through this prism we will address every single issue			0
' the prime minister said he had already set out ' the most radical set of actions that any government has ever contemplated in this country ' to tackle @entity134 immigration through curbs on access to benefits			1
mr @entity0 also insisted that the @entity10 was ' at the heart of this commitment for @entity61 to live within her means '			1
he added : ' people can see a real track record , a real commitment and it 's at the heart of what we are saying			0
' instead it has fallen by around 40 per cent in cash terms since the last election , and is now 5 per cent of @entity151 , half what it was in 2010			2
to eradicate the deficit , so the government raises more in tax than it spends , will require another £ 30billion of savings , mr @entity0 said			1
' that is a lot , but it 's doable			0
it requires us to continue the same rate of saving for the first two years of the next @entity164 , as we have done for the past five years			0
' it means reducing overall government spending by just one per cent each year			2
' put another way , we have to save £ 1 a year in every £ 100 that @entity168 spends			0
' i do n't think there 's a family or business that could n't do that – and i do n't think @entity168 , seeing as it 's your money , should be any different			0
' the @entity3 leader sought to personalise the election by asking parents and grandparents to consider whether , as a nation , they want to ' pass on a mountain of debt to the next generations that they could never hope to re-pay '			1
' to every mother , father , grandparent , uncle , aunt , i would ask this question , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' when you look at the children you love , do you want to land them with a legacy of huge debts ? do you want to limit their future , to make life more difficult for their generation , because we refuse to do the right thing in our generation ? ' i say we have a responsibility to act			0
we can get @entity61 back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure			0
' the speech comes a day before a @entity209 vote which @entity50 hope to use to highlight differences with @entity41 over economic strategy in the years after 2015 - 16			0
chancellor @entity212 has accused @entity41 of setting the scene for tax rises equivalent to 3p on income tax by refusing to match his pledge to balance the books by spending cuts alone			2
but @entity96 accused him of ' plucking figures out of the air ' and said @entity41 would eliminate the deficit by ' common sense ' spending cuts , tax rises targeted on the rich and a wage boost for the lowest - paid workers which he said would increase tax revenues and cut the bill for in - work benefits			1
mps will be asked tomorrow to approve a new charter for @entity235 committing the government to a goal of eradicating the structural current deficit on a rolling three - year horizon - which at the time of the next @entity241 will be 2017 - 18 - and ensure that debt is falling as a percentage of gdp by 2016 - 17			2
@entity41 has said it will back the plan , which it believes is compatible with its plans to eradicate the current deficit ' as soon as possible ' in the next @entity164			1
@entity0 says : we do n't just want to eliminate the current budget deficit we want to clear the entire budget deficit and start running a surplus			1
reality : at the 2010 election the @entity50 promised to ' eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a @entity164 '			2
instead it has fallen by around 40 per cent in cash terms since the last election , and is now 5 per cent of @entity151 , half what it was in 2010			0
the deficit will still be £ 91billion this year , requiring £ 30billion in spending cuts			2
@entity0 says : ' conservatives know the best way to help people out of poverty is not to hand them a benefit cheque ; it 's to help them get into work			2
' reality : employment has been one of the big success stories of the coalition , with a record 30.8million in work , 73 per cent of the working age population			0
@entity0 says : ' this is about your family 's money – about whether you get to keep more of your money each month with the @entity261 , or pay higher taxes with @entity41			1
' reality : the @entity50 have promised that no - one earning the minimum wage - equivalent to £ 12,500 - a - year - will pay any income tax at all , while point at which the 40p tax rate is levied will rise from around £ 42,000 to £ 50,000			0
the £ 7billion bill is likely to be met from the planned surplus			0
@entity0 says : ' for parents , the security of knowing your children are getting a decent education			1
' reality : latest @entity297 figures show the @entity61 languishing in mid-table in global education rankings , with maths and reading rated better in @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306			0
improving education standards and preparing young @entity61 for work will be vital to competing in the much - mocked ' global race ' and to increasing competition for jobs currently taken by migrants			2
@entity0 says : ' the security of having a home of your own – denied to too many for too long			2
' reality : the @entity50 have long prided themselves on being the party of home ownership , but the facts speak for themselves			0
latest figures show that just 65.2 per cent of people owned their home in 2012 - 13 , the lowest level since the early 1980s			0
@entity0 says : ' real dignity and security for those in retirement			1
these are the things that are on the ballot paper in may			0
' reality : the coalition introduced the ' triple lock ' on the state pension , which means it rises by inflation , wages or 2.5 per cent whichever is higher			0
the @entity50 are committed to continuing it			0
but it comes at a cost , with the bill for pensions making up the bulk of the welfare state , rising from £ 87billion in 2010 - +11 to £ 104billion last year .			0
