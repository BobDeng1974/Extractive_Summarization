' harsh conditions : these poles are deployed above the water , and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer , creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea annual process : the fishing crew are pictured transferring several dolphins into the 250 - strong pod rounded up : the dolphins were forced to wait in the pen for 19 hours until the holding reached critical mass today the @entity5 widow of @entity19 added her voice to pleas to dolphin fishermen that they stop their hunt , days after the @entity25 ambassador to @entity26 @entity131 waded into the row the reference was to the 2011 triple meltdowns at @entity135 after their reactors were swamped by a huge tsunami			1

tradition : each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins , putting the population at risk did she kill herself ? there is speculation that the mother of this albino dolphin trapped by @entity5 fishermen in a cove has committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby one of the crusaders from @entity80 , who hope to bring the dolphin 's plight to light ( left )			1

' it takes up to 20 to 30 minutes for these dolphins to die , where they bleed out , suffocate or drown in the process of being dragged to the butcher house , ' @entity80 activist @entity188 told @entity195			0
heavy machinery : fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea , on its way to either lifetime captivity or death boat : ' @entity205 ' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds , driving the dolphins to specific places preparation : fishermen and trainers unload the orange nets yesterday - just 24 hours before decision day ( @entity215 ) the fishermen are for the most part , a selection of fishermen from the @entity220			0

the dolphin hunting season runs yearly from september to march , the @entity48 fishing association said			0
@entity80 says 176 marine mammals had been killed this season , including bottlenose , spotted , striped and risso 's dolphins			2
exact monitoring is difficult , with fishermen erecting tarpaulins over their killing area and blocking access to the cove			0
the dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen			0
they are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for ' selection ' treatment : the fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear cramped : the cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim , forcing them to huddle up in groups @entity45 's comments were welcomed on monday by fugitive eco-activist @entity87 , who said he hoped it would help convince @entity26 to put a halt to the practice			2
