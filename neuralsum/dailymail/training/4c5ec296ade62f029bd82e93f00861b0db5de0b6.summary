we enjoy a good curmudgeon			1
' clearly you do n't , which is perfectly fine and understandable - whatever floats all our strange little boats , but it does n't quite seem healthy to me that your entire enjoyment of an experience be so dependent on the fact that me and my sisters got most of the sunny disposition genes			1
