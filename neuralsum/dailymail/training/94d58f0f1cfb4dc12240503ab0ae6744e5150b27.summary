@entity1 , a common summertime nuisance , may be more dangerous than once thought			1
the sea creatures have been around for half a billion years - and new information alleges that they are growing in numbers , killing people and wreaking havoc in the oceans			1
@entity9 's book ' @entity10 ! on @entity1 and the @entity12 , ' describes the danger jellyfish pose and how they have overrun various ecosystems			1
much of the species ' success , she says is based on their life cycle			1
you name it , jellyfish [ are ] " doing it , " ' she says			2
@entity1 , like the ones seen in this file photo , are growing in numbers , even as other species die and are wiped out one jellyfish , the @entity38 , is able to lay eggs when it is just 13 days old without needing a mate			1
it soon is able to lay 10,000 eggs per day			2
it also can eat over ten times its own body weight in food and can double in size each day			1
other jellyfish are extremely difficult to kill			0
when faced with death , some can ' de-grow ' - which means that ' they reduce in size , but their bodies remain in proportion , ' the @entity49 says			1
another species , the zombie jelly , is seemingly immortal			1
when its particles disintegrate , cells escape and form an entirely new jelly			1
this period of growth happens within five days			0
jellyfish have been strengthening their numbers and now appear at beaches all over the world , like in this file photo complex ecosystems , @entity9 says , at what have kept the jellyfish at bay			0
however , she claims that human involvement and manipulation have catapulted their growth and helped their numbers to explode			0
@entity9 claims that overfishing anchovies , which compete with jellyfish for food , have created swarms of the sea creatures in @entity84			1
jellyfish competitors quickly die out , leaving a ' stingy - slimy killing field , ' she says			1
plastic bags and drift lines may also destroy the few natural jellyfish predators , like sea turtles			2
jellyfish also use hard litter , like industrial waste , to form expansive nurseries			2
rising acid and carbon dioxide levels have been noted to kill off many fish species			1
@entity1 , however , reportedly thrive in these harsh environments			1
they release waste with high carbon levels -- which bacteria use to create ' carbon dioxide factories , ' @entity9 says			1
one example is the @entity105 -- in 2000 , jellyfish took over an area of sixty square miles			0
they survived the damage wrought by @entity110 and the 2011 oil spill , when thousands of other species died			2
jellyfish have thrived in the harsh @entity105 , as seen in this undated file photo , while thousands of other species have died these combined factors , she says , are what have allowed jellyfish to take over ' one bite at a time			2
'' [ there will be ] no coral reefs teeming with life			0
no more mighty whales or wobbling penguins			0
no lobsters or oysters , ' @entity9 says			0
@entity1 , like both the box jelly and @entity131 species , have taken dozens of lives			1
box jellies can kill within two minutes , the @entity49 reports			2
@entity131 , which can cause extreme cramps , spasms , and vomiting , have taken countless victims			0
many deaths are misdiagnosed as strokes and heart attacks			0
in groups , jellyfish ' have an uncanny knack for getting stuck , ' @entity9 writes			0
they can get sucked in and latch on to heavy structures			0
in july 2006 , jellyfish were sucked into the @entity149 @entity148 , wiping out onboard capabilities			0
@entity152 power plants have been ' under attack ' from jellyfish since the 1960s , claims the @entity49			0
the damage may be permanent , @entity9 says			0
' i think i underestimated how severely we have damaged our oceans and their inhabitants			2
i now think that we have pushed them too far [ ... ] without us knowing the precise moment it all became irreversible			0
' @entity1 , like the @entity152 @entity164 seen in this file photo , beat their competitors for food and thrive in carbon - heavy environments			1

with bacteria they can form ' carbon dioxide factories ' and destroy oceans
many jellies , like the ' zombie jelly , ' can stave off death and *re-grow*
@entity1 beat out other species for food , can create ' killing fields '
