a village primary school with just 13 pupils was put into special measures after an @entity4 inspection found too many incidents of racist or homophobic bullying and serious acts of violence			1
but the chairman of governors at @entity11 in rural @entity12 has fought back , claiming the report was based on a single incident of children using the word ‘ gay ’ as a throwaway comment and not knowing what it meant			1
@entity20 said it had been ‘ blown out of proportion ’ and also denied there had been any racism at the remote school , where all of the children are white			0
@entity11 , pictured , in rural @entity12 was put into special measures after an @entity4 inspection found too many incidents of racist or homophobic bullying and serious acts of violence she said she believed @entity4 had an agenda against small schools and suspected they ’d been unfairly labelled racist because racism and homophobia were treated as one category by @entity4			1
parents of pupils said the report was ‘ ludicrous ’			2
@entity42 , near @entity43 , was labelled ‘ inadequate ’ – the lowest rating out of four grades			0
inspectors visited the school in april , where pupils range from ages five to 11 and travel in from nearby hamlets and farms			2
their report condemned the behaviour of pupils and highlighted ‘ too many incidents of racist or homophobic bullying ’ , and ‘ serious instances of violence ’			1
staff were warned they urgently needed to improve pupils ’ behaviour as parents had already pulled out 12 children , out of just 25 , in a six - week period this year			0
@entity4 claimed this was because parents were ‘ concerned ’ about behaviour			0
however the chairman of governors insisted that pupils had been taken out of the school mainly because of parents being anxious about the need for them to engage with larger numbers of children			2
she said : ‘ parents have taken children out for a variety of reasons – racism and homophobic bullying have never been a reason			2
‘ as the school is getting below a certain size , parents have been worried about the social side of education they think their children need			0
’ she said she believed @entity4 ’s criticisms had been based on a single report in the school ’s own discipline record about children using the word ‘ gay ’			1
she said the school did not tolerate it and spoke to the child and their parents – and had since challenged the report with @entity4 but received no response			1
@entity42 in @entity12 has no pupils but six members of staff @entity105 , 43 , who has three children at the school , said : ‘ it is all absolute rubbish and upsettingly inaccurate			1
‘ it is totally ludicrous			0
i ’ve never heard of any racism , homophobia or serious violence			0
there are n’t even any ethnic minorities at the school – every kid is white			0
’ a statement from the school said @entity4 was not ‘ sensitive to the particular challenges faced by small rural schools ’			0
it added : ‘ we were particularly upset by the allegations of racist and homophobic bullying as we do not believe there have been any such incidents in the school			1
’ @entity4 stood by its report , insisting that both racist and homophobic comments had been made by pupils .			2
