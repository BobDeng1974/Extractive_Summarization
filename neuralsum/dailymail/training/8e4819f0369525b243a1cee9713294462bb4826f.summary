by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 14:08 est , 22 january 2014 a new record - breaking atomic clock is so precise it neither loses nor gains a second in five billion years - longer than the age of the @entity5			1
the ' strontium lattice clock ' is 50 % more accurate than the previous record holder , the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) quantum logic clock			1
it is also incredibly stable , in that each tick matches the duration of every other			0
the watch of the future ? @entity17 scientists say the ' strontium lattice clock ' is 50 % more accurate than the previous record holder , the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) quantum logic clock			1
atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels			0
in the strontium lattice clock , a few thousand atoms of strontium are held in a column of laser optical traps			1
scientists detect the clock 's ' ticks ' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light			1
the precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels			0
the clock , described in the journal nature , was developed in the @entity17 at the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , by a team from @entity8 and the @entity41			2
group leader dr @entity42 said : ' we already have plans to push the performance even more			0
' so in this sense , even this new nature paper represents only a ' mid-term ' report			0
' you can expect more new breakthroughs in our clocks in the next five to 10 years			0
' in terms of stability , the new clock equals the performance of @entity8 's world - leading ytterbium atomic clock			1

the new clock could lead to far more accurate timekeeping devices for everyone			2
