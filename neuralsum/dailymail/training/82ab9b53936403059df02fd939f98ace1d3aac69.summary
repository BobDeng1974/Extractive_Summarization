by @entity0 even as a very young boy in war - torn @entity3 , @entity1 harboured a fanciful dream			1
every friday he would go to a makeshift cinema and watch whatever film was available – usually a @entity9 movie or a grainy old classic			2
and as he sat there enthralled in front of the screen , he determined that one day he would be a movie star			2
yesterday that dream came one stage nearer fulfilment			2
@entity3 orphan @entity1 who fled his home country after his parents were murdered by the @entity19 has won a place at the @entity21 , @entity22 @entity1 – who fled to @entity23 after his mother and father were kidnapped and murdered by the @entity19 – was awarded a prestigious scholarship to the same drama school that moulded the likes of @entity29 , @entity30 , sir @entity31 and @entity32			1
he was chosen from thousands of hopefuls for a place at the @entity21 , even though when he arrived in @entity23 eight years ago he spoke barely a word of @entity36			1
the 16 - year - old gcse pupil is now about to embark on auditions for films and @entity40 plays – or , as he preferred to describe it : ‘ walking in the footsteps of @entity44 superstars			2
’ when he found out he had won the scholarship , he said , ‘ i just started shouting and jumping around the room			1
he was chosen from thousands of hopefuls for a place at the @entity21 , even though when he arrived in @entity23 eight years ago he spoke barely a word of @entity36 ‘ i never thought someone like me would get into a place like that			1
’ the remarkable story of the orphan boy from a far - off land and his acting dream could easily have come from a plot for the kind of movie in which he now aspires to star			2
back home in @entity62 , his cinema visits fuelled his ambition			0
‘ that ’s where the acting bug started for me , ’ he explained			0
his father was a high - ranking officer in the @entity68 , which marked out the whole family as targets for the @entity19 rebels			2
in 2006 his mother and father were abducted and killed while @entity1 , then an eight - year - old , was in school			1
he was hidden by one of his uncles for a month before he managed to flee to @entity36 to live with a cousin and his family in the @entity79 of @entity22			0
compared with his lifestyle in @entity62 , @entity1 said , ‘ it was a completely different world ’			1
he immediately started to learn @entity82 but struggled to adapt to the culture			0
the foundation for his success was @entity86 in @entity87 – which has the motto more is in me			0
@entity1 – who fled to @entity23 after his mother and father were kidnapped and murdered by the @entity19 – was awarded a prestigious scholarship to the same drama school that moulded the likes of @entity29 ( right ) and @entity30 ( left ) teachers encouraged him to study hard in order to pursue his acting ambitions			1
despite the lifestyle differences , @entity1 quickly made a shrewd assessment of the contrasts – a key , perhaps , to his admirable drive and endeavour			1
‘ it ’s weird because i have found it hard to mix in with @entity106 culture , ’ he said			0
‘ because we do not have much technology at home in @entity3 , kids would be out playing all the time			0
‘ here , everyone just stays in and plays on computers			0
’ @entity1 won a place at the @entity21 summer camp , an induction for the course , by impressing the assessors during a series of auditions with monologues from @entity124 ’s off - beat comedy @entity122			1
at first the modest teenager was reluctant to apply for the scholarship but was spurred on by his school drama teacher @entity127			2
the foundation for his success was @entity86 in @entity130 which has the motto more is in me			0
@entity1 ( centre ) with his drama teacher @entity127 ( right ) and school head teacher @entity135 ( left ) ‘ a lot of our kids come from tough backgrounds and often do n’t have the confidence to go after things like this , ’ said @entity137 , 28			1
‘ but once you help them believe in themselves , the transformation is incredible			0
’ @entity1 confessed he was ‘ very daunted ’ by the prospect of trying for the scholarship against such fierce opposition			1
‘ because i ’m @entity152 and from @entity3 , i was worried ; you do n’t see that many @entity152 @entity44 stars , ’ he said			0
‘ i have faced racism outside the school in the past so i was worried about that too			0
‘ but @entity127 was with me the whole way , helping with my monologue and telling me that i was good enough to do it			0
’ @entity1 , who likes action movies and lists @entity161 as his favourite , will spend eight years with the @entity21			1
naturally , he hopes one day to appear in a @entity44 blockbuster opposite some of his acting heroes and heroines			0
his favourite stars include @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			2
step one on that path to fame , however , is still to be taken			0
tomorrow , @entity1 sits his drama gcse exam .			1
