@entity0 has heaped praise on @entity2 , claiming that the full - back possesses all the attributes required in a winning team			1
speaking ahead of @entity8 's @entity7 tie against @entity9 on wednesday @entity0 said that winning the @entity7 was the pinnacle for every player and manager in @entity13			1
but the 51 - year - old also added that the @entity16 ' opponents would be tricky customers to deal with , especially in the cauldron of the @entity18			0
' the competition where normally every big club is , so obviously it 's the competition that every club wants and every player , every coach dreams to win			2
' @entity2 is the kind of player i like a lot			2
i think a team with 11 @entity2 's probably could win the competition because football is not just about the pure talent			1
' football is also about character and personality and @entity2 has all those traces of a winning personality			1
' last season i played against @entity9 so i know the team , the atmosphere , how difficult it is to play against them , especially in @entity57 but not just in @entity57			1
' they are a very experienced team , top players , big atmosphere at home , people that know how to compete and people that know how to create difficulties			0
' for sure by playing the first game at @entity67 they 're going to give us a difficult tie			0
' @entity8 players warm up during their team 's training session in front of huge pictures of @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , founder of modern @entity57 , and @entity57 prime minister @entity78 ( r ) in @entity67 solid : @entity81 's defensive displays have raised the question of whether @entity83 will miss him in the @entity84 up for the task : @entity8 players are put through their paces ahead of wednesday 's match against @entity9 out in the cold : @entity89 has spent a large part of the season having to warm himself on the bench earlier this season @entity2 went to great lengths to teach people - including his teammates to pronounce his surname			1
he produced a handy video which can be seen below			0
@entity0 's comments must come as a further knock for @entity89 with the left - back having lost his place in the starting line - up to the 24 - year - old @entity104 defender			2
@entity89 has started just 19 matches this season but despite @entity0 's apparent lack of faith in him , the aging leftback looks set to be offered a one - year contract extension			2
the manager also reiterated his belief that his side are one in transition and they remain too inconsistent to challenge for honours this year			0
despite @entity0 's claim @entity8 have lost just once in their last 12 league matches , since losing 3 - 2 to @entity119 on december 7 , having brushed aside rivals @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 in that time			1
however , an extra time loss to @entity126 in the quarter - finals of the @entity128 and a fourth round exit in the @entity130 at the hands of league opponents @entity121 have seen an unusually early exit for the @entity16 on the domestic cup front			0
@entity134 heads : @entity81 ( @entity76 ) and @entity135 ( c ) have been an integral part of @entity8 's rise in recent year in the zone : with 13 seasons at @entity135 has plenty of experience in the @entity7 ' we are not yet a stable team , we are not yet a team ready to perform consistently game after game , week after week , ' admitted @entity0			1
' we are a team with little up and downs			0
four victories , two defeats , i think it shows a little bit the quality of the team but at the same time we will beat that inconsistency			0
' the special one also took the time to speak about @entity159 play maker @entity158 who has been paramount to much of @entity8 's success this season			1
having sidelined @entity163 to give the 22 - year - old a more prominent role , @entity0 acknowledged that @entity158 is still continuing to grow as a player			2
@entity159 wonder : @entity158 takes aim during @entity8 's hard fought victory against @entity124 on saturday copycat ? @entity158 's celebration after scoring a goal is reminiscent of @entity173 's trademark heart celebration flying high : @entity158 takes on @entity174 during @entity8 's 3 - 1 demolition of @entity123 in january ' @entity158 has a fantastic talent ; he plays a second year in @entity8 , he plays more or less a second year also in the @entity159 national team so he 's coming step by step			1
' physically he needs time to put himself in a top condition , tactically he 's a very open boy that wants very much to learn			0
' obviously technically he 's a typically @entity159 talent so @entity158 has also everything to make some history in the competition			0
' @entity0 was speaking to promote @entity187 , bringing together the best of the @entity7 in one place			2
