@entity0 is determined to prevent a season of outstanding personal achievement from ending with a sting its tail			1
the prospect of watching @entity6 celebrate title glory inside @entity8 would , he admits , be a painful experience to bear			1
after sticking to the coat - tails of the champions for so long , this would be the most unwelcome denouement imaginable			2
should the current eight - point gap between the teams remain intact , then @entity16 ’s side will have the chance to clinch a fourth successive @entity19 crown when they head to the north - east on may 10			1
@entity21 striker @entity0 does not want to see @entity6 win the league on their patch on may 11 @entity24 , though , expects @entity21 to be fully motivated to prevent a green - and - white party from getting underway			1
‘ if they are going to win it they are going to win it , ’ said the 27 - year - old striker , who on thursday made the shortlist for @entity28			1
‘ obviously , though , we would n’t like to see them celebrating on our patch because of the season we have had			2
we have pushed them close enough this year , so it would n’t be nice to watch that			2
‘ you do n’t want to see teams celebrating			2
you want to be the ones celebrating , particularly at home			2
i would n’t like it for the fans so we just have to make sure that , on the day , we win the game			2
’ somewhat ominously for @entity21 , they have lost all three previous meetings with @entity6 this season			1
a 4 - 0 reverse at @entity51 early last month killed off any realistic prospect of a first championship flag in 30 years being flown at @entity8			2
the points total @entity21 have amassed proves that they have been every bit as good as @entity6 against the other teams in the top flight			1
@entity6 are eight points ahead of second place @entity60 and could win the title when they face their nearest challengers on may 11 but is it feasible for @entity65 ’ outfit to take that final , most difficult , step and view winning the league as a realistic aim in the next year or two ? ‘ people were waiting to see how we got on this year in case we dropped back down again , ’ said @entity24			1
‘ but because of the stability we have with lads tied up on contracts , and the way the gaffer goes about things , no - one was going to slack off			2
‘ hopefully we can add some quality over the summer as well			0
i do n’t think there will be massive numbers going in and out , but hopefully we can keep building			0
‘ if we can even be a few points closer again this time next year , and @entity6 drop off , we could be there or thereabouts			1
‘ we are only eight points behind @entity6 at this stage of the season when most teams would expect to be at least 30 points behind them			1
@entity24 was nominated for the @entity93 @entity28 and has netted 27 times this season ‘ i do n’t think we ’ve lost to anyone other than @entity6 in the league since october , which is such a great achievement			1
‘ it ’s just down to the job the gaffer and @entity101 have done			0
they have brought a lot of quality into the squad			0
‘ we spent money on @entity107 from @entity108 , which shows the club is ambitious , and @entity110 is coming in the summer			0
‘ he was a young lad when i was at @entity111 and he is a great signing for us			0
i thought he was brilliant in the @entity113 semi-final against @entity6 last sunday			1
he was by far one of the best players on the pitch , which is saying something when you consider the quality which was on show in that game			0
’ if @entity110 proves as good an addition as @entity24 – signed from @entity124 in january 2014 - then @entity65 will be utterly delighted			0
the @entity126 ’s 27 goals this season have been a crucial component in the red results machine and even led @entity21 legend @entity130 to claim he was up with @entity131 and @entity132 in terms of the finest @entity21 strikers of recent decades			1
@entity24 scored the winning goal for @entity21 against @entity136 last saturday ‘ he must have been drunk when he said that ! ’ laughed a self - effacing @entity24			1
‘ i think @entity138 also compared me to @entity139 and he got stick for that			0
‘ it ’s obviously nice to have good things said about you but i just want to try and keep it going until the end of the season			0
‘ @entity148 used to compare me to @entity149 when i was at @entity111 and i got stick for that , too			0
i think i ’ve been compared to everyone apart from @entity152 , who is the only one i look like ! ‘ i ’m scoring goals because the lads have created so my chances for me			0
my target is to get as many as possible and i ’m only three away from 30 now , so it would be nice to get there			0
‘ i was n’t aware until you told me that i ’d only be the sixth player in @entity21 ’ s history to do it - so thanks for the pressure ! but it would obviously be a great accolade to get			1
‘ confidence has been high			0
i managed to get a few goals in the @entity167 at the start of the season and it ’s just gone from there			0
‘ the team have dominated a lot of games this season , so i ’ve been lucky enough to be in the right place to get on the end of what has been created			0

@entity6 are eight points clear of @entity21 in the @entity19
if the gap stays the same @entity6 could win the title at @entity21 on may 11
@entity21 *'s* @entity0 does *n't* want @entity6 to celebrate on their patch
