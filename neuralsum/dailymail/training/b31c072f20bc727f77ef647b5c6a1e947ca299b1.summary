@entity0 has suspended the star of its first @entity3 election tv broadcast after it emerged that he condemned @entity6 as ‘ not a real @entity7 ’ , suggested @entity8 should ‘ kill themselves off ’ and said @entity9 was an evil religion with a paedophile prophet			1
@entity13 also said he loathed the charity @entity14 and welcomed @entity16 outbreaks in @entity8 , saying : ‘ inner peace will come when @entity16 does what it should and reduce @entity8 density			2
’ like party leader @entity20 , he said he admired @entity22 leader @entity21 , adding : ‘ at least @entity21 loves his country			2
@entity25 does not love @entity26 , he loves the @entity27			0
the builder , who describes himself as ‘ born @entity26 in @entity42 ’ , was one of five supporters hand - picked to appear in a prime - time television campaign starting this week			0
he was featured in the broadcast criticising immigration from the @entity27 , saying : ‘ since the lads from @entity52 are prepared to work for a lot less than anybody else , i ’ve found it a real struggle			0
’ yesterday , the party said it was suspending him after discovering he had expressed ‘ repellent ’ views in a series of potentially unlawful messages on @entity61 over recent months			1
in one tweet he claimed that @entity9 was not a religion and called it an ‘ evil organisation respecting a prophet who as a pedo			0
’ [ sic ] he added : ‘ all @entity69 need to leave @entity52 ... or denounce their pathetic satanic religion			0
’ his appearance had been part of a major drive by the party to present a more professional image another message insisted : ‘ most @entity77 are generally bad people ... i grew up in @entity8 and dare anyone to prove me wrong			0
’ he suggested @entity8 should be ‘ left to ‘ kill themselves off ’ and suggested people should ‘ get over ’ slavery , which he said was an ‘ act of war ’			0
' his racist views might even make the @entity88 wince with embarrassment ' @entity90 , @entity91 president condemning the @entity93 leader , he said : ‘ @entity6 is not a real @entity7			0
i hope he never gets to be @entity94 ! he was only born here			0
’ in another message , he said mr @entity6 , whose father @entity96 was born in @entity97 to @entity99 parents , was ‘ @entity99 , not @entity26 ’			0
he also suggested examination of statistics on rape would reveal a racial bias among attackers , and in another message declared : ‘ @entity106 was right ’			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we are deeply shocked that mr @entity13 has expressed such repellent views			1
‘ his membership of the party has been suspended immediately pending a full disciplinary process			1
’ however , it was not clear whether mr @entity13 can be removed from the party ’s list of council candidates in @entity38 , because nominations closed yesterday			1
the timing of the row is unfortunate for mr @entity20 , who has this week rejected claims from some @entity121 that his party ’s latest election billboards on immigration are racist			0
@entity0 had suggested its candidates would be put through more rigorous checks following a series of controversies over the views of some on race , gay marriage and other issues			1
it faces questions about how it failed to check messages posted over several months and available for all to see on mr @entity13 ’s @entity61 page			1
last night his account appeared to have been deleted and he could not be reached			0
@entity91 president @entity90 said : ‘ i can not believe @entity0 did not check the comments of this man before they used him in their broadcast			1
the row is a blow for @entity0 leader @entity20 , who spent the day campaigning in @entity147 in @entity148 ‘ his racist views might even make the @entity88 wince with embarrassment			2
a week after the @entity152 opened their arms to @entity0 , with comments like these it ’s easy to see why they did			1
‘ @entity0 might wrap themselves in the flag , but these comments are deeply offensive to anyone with decent @entity26 values			1
’ ' we are deeply shocked that mr @entity13 has expressed such repellent views ' @entity0 spokesman mr @entity20 promised to eliminate ‘ @entity172 ’ from his candidate list after @entity0 defence spokesman @entity165 - one of his closest allies - quit following outbursts in which he described foreign nations as ‘ @entity169 ’ and women as ‘ sluts ’			1
the @entity0 leader said he would ensure only ‘ reliable , steady , solid people ’ could run for election			2
@entity93 's shadow home secretary @entity176 described mr @entity13 's tweets as nasty and divisive			2
she said on @entity61 : ' appalling tweets from @entity0 member chosen to front campaign			1
@entity0 should reflect very carefully on the way they encourage nasty divisive views			2

@entity13 posed in a builder 's hat in party political broadcast
but @entity0 seemed *unaware* of series of shocking comments on @entity61
the @entity29 also branded the @entity192 a paedophile
@entity0 says it has suspended his membership pending *investigation*
