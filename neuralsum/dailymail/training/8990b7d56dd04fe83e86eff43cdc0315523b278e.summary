that 's the idea behind a new app , @entity14 , which is to launch shortly on @entity15			1
the adverts would n't be simple poster adverts - the whole screen would be ' branded ' with the logos and ' look ' of companies , and deliver information to users			0
the new apps will be created in partnership with @entity25 , an online advertising company			2
' this is real prime real estate , ' said @entity28 , vp of @entity25 's mobile strategy			1
' the brand gets much higher exposure , which drives more traffic to their app or web site			0
' the ' branded ' apps are likely to be created in partnership with companies that offer constant information updates , such as sports results or stock prices , so that users have an incentive to use the app. at present , a test version of @entity14 is available free via @entity46 's play marketplace , unbranded , offering a ' custom ' lock screen where users can navigate directly to the last app they used or to the photo application , for instance			2
this test version will not be developed into a finished product , and instead @entity25 will create ' branded ' versions in collaboration with other companies			0
the current free app will not be developed into a finished product - instead , @entity25 will unveil new versions in partnership with companies that deliver information such as sports scores and stock prices @entity25 said that it would not permit companies to create apps that were simply adverts - the ' lock ' would have to offers some function .			0

' @entity71 ' screens will pop up every time users turn phone on
' this is prime real estate ' says advert company
