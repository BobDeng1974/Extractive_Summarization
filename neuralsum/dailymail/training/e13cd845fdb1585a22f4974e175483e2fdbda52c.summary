by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 four years ago , the @entity3 team were setting off to a @entity4 under a manager who claimed to need no more than 100 words of the language to do the job			1
@entity9 , when asked if he had the nerve to drop @entity11 , should that be necessary , replied : ‘ i would like to think that , having been a manager / coach for a long time , i have the capacity to make the decisions that are necessary			1
’ that ’s a yes , then , courtesy of a classic @entity16			2
there will be plenty more of those to enjoy over the next few weeks , but it is not simply the fact that @entity9 has a better vocabulary than @entity22 which makes this tilt at the world title different			1
contrast : four years ago the @entity3 camp was an unhappy place under @entity22 in @entity28 more like it : captain @entity30 watches on as @entity31 speaks at a press conference on thursday @entity3 ’s camp is a positive place , feeding off the energy of young blood and low expectations as they prepare for their farewell friendly in @entity39 before setting out for the @entity40 and then @entity41			1
four years ago , @entity22 had the @entity44 in a fluster , first with his ill - conceived @entity46 — an online rating system for all players at the @entity4 including his own — and then by showing interest in a job at @entity51			1
inside the squad , there were tensions as the manager tried to lure various stalwarts from international retirement and undermined the confidence of the goalkeepers before subjecting his players to an extreme training regime in the @entity62 and an isolated boot camp near @entity64			2
the hardline methods which made @entity22 a managerial legend did not transplant smoothly to an international tournament			1
he admitted this after @entity3 had crashed out to @entity69 in the last 16			1
he will not make the same mistakes in @entity41 with @entity71			2
@entity9 has experienced a @entity4 as a manager			1
he knows more @entity74 words and has generated a healthy atmosphere , although he bristled at the idea his squad were ‘ relaxed ’			2
not a word he likes , apparently			0
hard to understand ? @entity22 's way did n't translate well to a major tournament ‘ if i could bottle what i ’m seeing in training at the moment and release it in @entity41 then i ’d be a very happy man , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i ’ve been impressed by the attitude , enthusiasm and energy and the quality , of course			0
’ unlike at the @entity92 two years ago , when he took charge very close to the tournament having quit @entity96 , this is very much @entity9 ’s caper			1
this is his team , his captain and his spirit			0
he is tapping into collective success at clubs like @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity9 selected five from @entity104 in his last team — against @entity106 in march — and they are all available again			1
and he hopes @entity107 and @entity108 will help him maintain the equilibrium by allowing him to take standby pair @entity110 and @entity111 to @entity112 next week			0
if he does need to drop @entity11 , @entity9 will do it his way , using his carefully - selected words			1
he probably wo n’t need to			0
@entity11 looks fit and hungry , in contrast to his demeanour in @entity28			1
so far so good , but @entity9 is wary of getting carried away			2
he will seek assurances against @entity119 that this team is evolving in the right way ; that his direction is true			2
slur : @entity11 rants at the cameras after a 0 - 0 draw with @entity126 at the 2010 @entity4 fighting fit : the striker is in better shape under @entity9 ahead of this summer 's tournament the @entity130 are not expected to be strong			1
they failed to qualify for the @entity4 from a regional group without hosts @entity41 and have important players missing , including @entity136 ’s @entity135 and @entity138 ’s @entity137			2
@entity3 want to go out with a bang before a big @entity141 crowd — @entity9 promised to keep any experiments up his sleeve for friendlies against @entity145 and @entity146 — but will not issue orders to be careful about injuries			1
‘ once you start doing that , you set yourself up to be injured , ’ he said			0
instead , he will ask his team to stick to their principles and added : ‘ we ’ve been building up to get principles of play that suit us			0
they ’re the principles we ’ll be taking with us to @entity41			0
‘ we are a positive team who take the game to the opposition			2
we are prepared to accept the responsibility of taking the initiative in games			0
we do n’t sit back and wait to see what happens			0
’ respect : @entity9 speaks to his players during training on tuesday at @entity167 ready for it : @entity3 want to go out with a bang against @entity119 on friday at @entity141 aside from this boldness , @entity9 ’s natural caution is ably reflected by his captain , @entity30			1
‘ it ’s a bit early to come out with any ludicrous shouts about how good this team is , ’ said @entity30			0
it is all about the opener against @entity179 in @entity180			0
@entity9 said : ‘ most important is never to take our eye off the ball			2
our job is to be in peak condition on june 14			0
it does n’t help a great deal if you peak 10 days before or 10 days afterwards			0
‘ i could n’t have wished for a better week , as long as the game goes well			0
if it does n’t it will be a great disappointment			0

@entity3 's young camp ahead of the @entity4 is a positive place
@entity22 had the @entity44 in a fluster four years ago
@entity9 is strong enough to drop @entity11 *...* and keep him happy
@entity3 face @entity119 at @entity141 in their first warm - up friendly on friday
