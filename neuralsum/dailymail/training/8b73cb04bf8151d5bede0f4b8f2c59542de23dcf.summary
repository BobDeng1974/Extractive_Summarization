' in the game : @entity0 , seen on june 5 calling out @entity31 ' @entity30 after a play review , says he is gay and that he married his longtime partner in november 2013 @entity0 said in a story posted by @entity10 on tuesday that ' my thought process was , is that there 's a story about my career and how i got started in umpiring and they 're talking to people i have known since junior high and it did n't seem right to have a whole story and pictures without a picture of @entity47 and i , someone who 's been with me through this entire process			1
we met the october after my first year in the big leagues			1
' obviously , when i sent that picture to @entity53 [ @entity54 , referee magazine 's editor ] , i knew exactly what it meant			0
in a small way , this was opening that door in a publication that was n't going to be circulated nationwide			0
it could be picked up , but it 's not @entity65			0
i made that decision to go ahead and do it because i felt it was the right thing to do			0
' he continued , ' i realized that it could open a @entity70 , but this is not a surprise to @entity1 , the people i work for			1
it 's not a surprise to the umpire staff			1
until @entity47 and i got married last november , he was my same - sex domestic partner and had his own @entity76 and was on my insurance policy			1
' this is not going to be some huge flashing news to @entity80 [ @entity1 headquarters ] , but i also did n't want to be making some coming out story , some banner headline , because that 's not how i operate			2
it 's not a shock to @entity1 management because they 're well aware of my situation and it 's not a shock to the umpire staff			1
if it would have been , i do n't think i would have done it			0
' tough call : @entity0 is seen in a dispute with @entity96 ' @entity95 and @entity97 during an august 2008 game @entity0 did not hear from anyone regarding the publication of the image showing him and his husband though he received congratulatory comments for the profile , @entity10 reported			2
according to the website , @entity0 and @entity11 first crossed paths when they were both at the same @entity109 gay bar in 1986			1
@entity0 told @entity10 ' it 's still a headline , look at @entity112			2
people scream at me because i 'm an umpire			0
the last thing i want is people screaming at me because i 'm gay			0
i 'm an umpire who happens to be gay			2
i 'm not trying to be some gay person who happens to be an umpire			2
