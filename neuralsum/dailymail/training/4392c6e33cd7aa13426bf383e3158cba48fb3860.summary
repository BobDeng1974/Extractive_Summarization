the @entity10 rover can be seen trundling across the pockmarked surface of @entity13 's satellite in pictures released today by the @entity15			2
the successful soft - landing of the @entity17 lander in december made @entity3 the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the @entity20 and @entity21			1
chasing the horizon : the sky over the @entity6 appears inky black in this picture showing the @entity10 rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the @entity17 lander and released today by @entity3 scientists great leap forward : the successful soft - landing of the @entity17 lander in december made @entity3 the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the @entity20 and @entity21 the country 's achievement comes just a decade after it first sent an astronaut into space , and has got the @entity3 leadership on a patriotic high			1
the mission is seen as a symbol of @entity3 's rising global stature and technological advancement , as well as the @entity42 's success in reversing the fortunes of the once - impoverished nation			1
in a patriotic , and perhaps self - aware , spin on the ubiquity of produts ' made in @entity3 ' , president @entity45 earlier this week called the landing ' a real and genuine @entity3 product			1
' as he congratulated the scientists and engineers of the space programme at @entity56 € ™ s @entity55 on monday morning , he insisted : ' the most fundamental point is that @entity59 € ™ s space industry insists on self - reliant and independent innovation			2
' but it 's a claim that 's been called into doubt by some scientists , who have suggested the design of the @entity3 rover appears to borrow heavily from its @entity67 and @entity20 predecessors			1
and now what ? a photo taken from the @entity17 lander shows the barren landscape of the @entity6 @entity17 's soft - landing was carried out 12 days after it blasted off on an @entity73 carrier rocket even some engineers involved in designing the vehicle have said their version is derivative			1
' there is no denying the similarities , ' said professor @entity79 from @entity80 in @entity81 after the rover was unveiled			0
he admitted to the @entity83 that the @entity3 rover ' borrowed heavily from other countries , in particularly the @entity20			2
' ' a lot of things have been drawn from the reliable and successful design of the [ @entity20 ] @entity90 rover , ' he told the @entity92 - based paper			0
this digitally - combined panoramic photo taken on december 23 shows the moonscape around the @entity17 a second digitally - combined panoramic photo shows the moonscape around the @entity97 knock off or not , there 's no denying the ambition of the @entity3 's @entity6 mission , which on december 14 achieved the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades and aims at a manned mission by 2020			2
as colour images showing the @entity3 national flag on the rover were transmitted live to the @entity106 , the @entity42 branded the touchdown a ' milestone '			0
@entity109 , consultant editor for @entity110 and @entity111 , said at the time : ' it 's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world			0
' especially somewhere like the moon , which does n't have an atmosphere so you ca n't use parachutes or anything like that			0
' you have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you do n't end up in a crater on top of a large rock			0
' coming down : a photo taken by the @entity17 's landing camera shows the lunar surface n from a height of 7.9km a photo from 99m above the @entity6 : @entity109 , consultant editor for @entity110 and @entity111 , said at the time that it 's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world @entity17 adopted a variable thrust engine designed and made by @entity3 scientists			1
its thrust power ranges from 1,500 to 7,500 newtons , according to the country 's space agency			0
the soft - landing was carried out 12 days after the probe blasted off on an enhanced @entity73 carrier rocket			0
the last soft - landing was carried out by the @entity144 in 1976 .			0

president @entity45 made the comments while congratulating scientists
could be a self - aware spin on worldwide ubiquity of @entity3 - made goods
*ironically* , even @entity10 's engineers admit their design is derivative
