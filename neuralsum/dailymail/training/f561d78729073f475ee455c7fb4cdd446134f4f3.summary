' i had gone to the surprise birthday party alone because my wife went to the hospital as my stepdaughter was going into labour with twins , ' he said			0
' it was really dark at that time and i assumed nobody was about , so was surprised when i heard a voice - it said " what are you staring at ? " two teenagers suddenly appeared out of the darkness and they seemed quite agitated			2
' i told them i did n’t want any trouble , that i ’d had a good night and that i was looking forward to going to bed			0
i thought that was the end of it , but as i was getting ready for bed i heard a lot of noise coming from the park			2
' i love that park and go there a lot with my dog @entity90 and my granddaughter , so it really annoyed me that they were vandalising it			2
i pulled on a pair of jeans and trainers and headed out			2
' he went out to talk to the youths , but when they became very abusive and angry he turned to walk away			1
as he did so he felt a great heavy blow from behind			0
“ they came out of nowhere saying they were doing it because they had nothing else to do , then one of them squared up to me saying , ‘ go on touch me ’ over and over again and that ’s when i really started to panic , ' he said			0
' the best thing i thought to do was just a walk off , but i must have taken about three steps when i felt a hard thump from behind			0
' he hit me again and my glasses went onto the floor			0
i could hardly see where they had landed so bent down to pick them up			0
' they started punching and kicking me - i just thought to myself i had to stay on my feet , it was my only chance otherwise they would knock me into a coma			2
' i heard my nose crack twice , the pain was unbelievable			2
blood was streaming down my face , it was just pouring out			0
my right eye was bleeding too and i could feel it closing up			0
suffering : mr @entity13 has permanent damage to his right eye and scars to his face , while the vision in one of his eyes is still impaired following the attack near his home wary : mr @entity13 welcomed the sentencing , but said that in the future he would not intervene should a similar situation occur in the future ' i was bent over trying to fend them off , shouting , " i ’ve had enough , leave me alone " , but it just carried on			1
' mr @entity13 eventually escaped and ran back into the safety of his home , but he was followed and the same two yobs began smashing up his neighbour ’s car			1
he said : ' i yelled for my wife to call the police and headed straight for the shower to wash all of the blood off			0
then my neighbour was at the door saying the lads kicked in the doors of his car			2
' they obviously thought i ’d gone into that house - i could n’t believe beating me up was n’t enough for them			2
i just kept thinking , that could have been my head			0
' mr @entity13 was taken to @entity162 where he was x-rayed and then transferred for special surgery at @entity164 to stich up the hole in his cheek			1
' you could have stuck your little finger through my cheek , i could n’t believe it when i looked in the mirror , i was a mess			2
scene : mr @entity13 at the spot where he was attacked in march last year ' it frustrates me that these thugs have ruined what was supposed to be a happy time in our lives - the birth of our two grandsons who were born earlier that evening			1
' both @entity8 and the 17 - year - old admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at @entity184			1
the younger boy also admitted criminal damage and both were sentenced to three years detention			1
mr @entity13 welcomed the sentencing , but said that in the future he would not intervene should a similar situation occur in the future as he did not want to suffer the same fate as tragic @entity194 , who was kicked to death as he confronted youths damaging his wife ’s car outside their home in @entity201 , @entity202 in 2007			1

unharmed : mr @entity13 at his beloved @entity212 prior to last year 's vicious attack family ties : mr @entity13 and his wife @entity205 , 49 ' it ’s not worth risking my own life tackling these people in future			1
' obviously i do n’t like the senseless damage of things and it annoys me people get a kick out of smashing up the park			0
' then you then hear about what happens to other people like @entity194 who lost his life doing something like i did - and i think that could have been me			0
' if i ’d fallen to the ground unconscious and been beaten some more , my wife may have been going to a funeral			0
