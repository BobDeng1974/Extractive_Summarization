by @entity0 tories demanded a show of force against @entity4 yesterday after a @entity4 vessel made a ‘ provocative incursion ’ into @entity8 ’s territorial waters			1
@entity9 summoned the @entity4 ambassador for a dressing down after the ocean survey vessel spent 20 hours defying the @entity14 ’s demands that it depart , escalating the diplomatic tensions over the @entity16			1
the incident was denounced in @entity9 as the ship withdrew last night			1
the @entity4 ambassador has now been summoned to explain but @entity26 mp colonel @entity25 , who was the @entity9 @entity27 commander during the @entity29 war , said that if the government is serious about defending @entity8 ’s sovereignty it should send major combat units to deter @entity4 grandstanding			1
former @entity26 mp @entity35 added : ‘ the next time a @entity4 ship enters gibraltarian waters and refuses to leave after @entity14 warnings we should fire on them			1
’ the long - standing dispute between @entity9 and @entity4 has flared up over the past two years			1
prime minister @entity42 has blocked the @entity4 - @entity44 border and staged numerous incursions into @entity44 waters			2
the latest crisis occurred when a research vessel belonging to the @entity4 state , the @entity48 @entity49 , undertook significant surveying activity in @entity8 ’s territorial waters			2
a @entity14 fast patrol boat was dispatched to order it to leave			0
a video that appeared on @entity57 showed the @entity4 survey ship being flanked by small inflatable @entity14 boats			2
an audio recording that was also broadcast starts with the captain of the @entity49 saying : ‘ we have the permission of the @entity4 authorities			2
’ tensions have been high in the region since the summer when @entity4 imposed border checks on every car causing up to six hours of delays an officer in one of the @entity9 boats replies : ‘ you are in @entity8 territorial waters			1
i consider you to be violating the @entity75 , article one nine , governing the rights of passage			0
your activities are being recorded and reported via the national authorities			0
‘ you are to cease your ongoing activities and to leave @entity8 territorial waters immediately			2
’ the captain of the @entity4 boat then responds : ‘ good afternoon , sir			0
we are carrying out our survey work			0
we will continue with our work			0
we have got the necessary permits from @entity4 to perform such work			0
’ the boat withdrew only after @entity4 ambassador @entity88 was summoned by @entity89 , acting permanent under secretary at the @entity90 – the third time he has been summoned over @entity8 since the current @entity4 government took office in december 2011			1
europe minister @entity94 said : ‘ i strongly condemn this provocative incursion and urge the @entity4 government to ensure that it is not repeated			0
we stand ready to do whatever is required to protect @entity8 ’s sovereignty , economy and security			0
’ mr @entity94 said @entity4 has increased the number of its incursions into @entity9 territorial waters from around five per month to around 40 per month			1
the event comes two weeks after a @entity4 boat made dangerous manoeuvres near @entity14 vessels in @entity9 waters , putting lives at risk and resulting in a minor collision			1
a @entity90 source described relations with @entity4 as ‘ well past the asking nicely stage ’			1
but conservatives expressed frustration that the government has not taken a firmer line against @entity4 provocation			0
@entity119 did not protest last week when the @entity120 refused to condemn @entity4 for blocking the @entity4 - @entity8 border over the summer			2
colonel @entity25 called for troops to be sent to the @entity16 : ‘ i am afraid the government has got to be stronger			0
‘ for goodness sake , can we get a stronger response to what ’s happening to our people in @entity8 ? why does n’t the @entity124 make more use of the defence facilities in @entity8 , by sending down more often an infantry company to be based in @entity8 for perhaps six weeks at a time to exercise there , rather than sending it to somewhere like @entity134			0
’ foreign office minister @entity136 responded : ‘ we must strike a balance between being forceful , strong , determined to ensure the @entity4 understand the @entity9 @entity124 ’s position			1
‘ but we must also find mechanisms to de-escalate the situation , which is why we must get back to discussing solutions – without negotiating @entity44 sovereignty			0

refused to leave for 20 hours despite being *contacted* by @entity20
