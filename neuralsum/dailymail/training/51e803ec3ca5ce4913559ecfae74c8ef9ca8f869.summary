prosecutors say 62 - year - old @entity7 sexually assaulted some 40 women			1
now he is set to be released and move into a residential community north of @entity10 by the first week of july in spite of a host of vocal protests			1
neighbors there say they are angry , afraid and fighting to keep him out			0
so many arrests : mr @entity7 was released into parole multiple times , and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and re-incarcerate him home sweet home : this is the @entity24 home officials have decided will house the serial rapist @entity28 judge @entity27 issued a brief order saying that @entity7 , 63 , must be released by july 7 , @entity10 district attorney @entity26 said in a statement			1
with several severe restrictions that include 24 - hour gps monitoring , @entity7 will be allowed to rent a small house in a remote area in @entity24 , near the city of @entity36			1
the decision comes two days after a daylong hearing in @entity5 , where @entity27 heard passionate objections from residents , many of whom drove 350 miles north from @entity43			1
@entity7 's most recent crimes occurred in @entity45 , but @entity27 ordered him released to @entity10 , where @entity7 was born and raised			1
fighting back : protests took place in 1994 , pictured , when @entity7 was due to be released however he failed psychological testing and was committed to a state hospital a very sick man : @entity7 admitted to raping 38 women , but said about 70 other rapes went unreported @entity7 has acknowledged raping and assaulting about 40 women between 1971 and 1982 , when he was sentenced to 16 years in prison			1
he was paroled in 1990 , but arrested in a new attack just two months later and returned to prison until 1996			2
when his term ended , he was deemed a sexually violent predator and confined to a state mental hospital			1
doctors at the hospital recently concluded he was fit for release , but few options were available			2
@entity5 laws bar sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of schools and other places where children congregate , eliminating nearly all urban areas in the state			1
furious : @entity72 says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood local leaders quickly denounced the decision			2
county supervisor @entity78 called it ' an unconscionable threat to public safety			0
' @entity36 mayor @entity82 said he was ' a little upset ' on learning the news			0
' it 's very disappointing , very disappointing that this guy with this kind of record in the past would be put into any community , ' he said			0
@entity82 said the city is going to continue to try to fight the order			0
‘ i have a daughter , so this is n't going to work for me , ’ @entity72 told @entity93			2
mr @entity72 stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop			1
‘ that ’s where children get off , ’ he angrily shouted			0
just a door down from a bus stop : ' you see that right there , past the @entity107 , that 's where the drop the kids off ' mr @entity72 points to and explains the home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of @entity115 , which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school			1
the landlord of the property has agreed to rent the home to @entity7 , seeing as it falls within the laws for sex offenders			2
‘ the bus stop is right in front of my house , with all the kids , ’ @entity127 told @entity128 @entity10 , ‘ i do n’t know what the heck ’s going on with that			1
’ @entity133 , 19 , pointed to three houses where children live , telling @entity128 @entity10 that ‘ a lot of children live around here … he ’s a rapist and he can do it again			2
’ mr @entity7 was put on parole multiple times , and kept raping women in both the @entity10 and @entity142 areas , terrorizing the state with his deviancy			1
officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community			0
the pervert ’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he could n’t control his violent urges , @entity149 @entity78 told @entity154			0
' that 's crazy ' : @entity127 lives next door , the bus stop is in front of his home , he can not believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist ‘ he belongs in a mental institution , a state hospital ’ mr @entity78 said during a recent press conference , ‘ he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes			1
’ ‘ his past behavior is not a one - time occurrence where he made a mistake			0
we ’re talking over and over again , ’ mr @entity78 added			0
they 're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they 're dumping him in the [ area ] , ’ a @entity36 city spokesperson told the @entity182			0
‘ we do n't think that 's right , ’ the spokesperson added			0
mr @entity7 was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern @entity5 , he soon admitted raping 20 women , records cited by the @entity182 show			1
only seven years later , he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man			1
he was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women			0
based on his own estimates , mr @entity7 raped well over 100 women			2
‘ it really angers me , ’ another local resident told the @entity182			0
‘ my wife and i are getting to the point where we 're anxious to leave @entity5 anyway			2
that might get us to ... move quicker			0
’ mr @entity7 will be required to wear a gps monitor at all times , an official told the @entity182			2
the monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park , or even if he violates curfew			2
still , that ’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area			0
not in our neighborhood ! : residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools ‘ this is like a bad dream right now because i 'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood , ’ mr @entity72 told @entity220 @entity223 , one of the residents who drove north to the hearing and a member of a community group created to fight the release , said she and others from the @entity229 were already heading to protest at @entity7 's new home , which is about five miles from her own			1
@entity223 said she was shaking because of the news , which she said was made worse by terrible memories of being raped as a 14 - year - old by two men at knifepoint and impregnated			0
' i think it 's wrong , ' @entity223 said			0
' when this guy commits another crime , the blood 's going to be on that judge 's shoulders			0
