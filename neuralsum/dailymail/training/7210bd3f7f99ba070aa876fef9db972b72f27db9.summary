the five largest theater chains in @entity1 have announced that they are pulling the interview from their schedules after hackers threatened 9/11 - like terror attacks on cinemas showing the @entity8 film			1
combined - @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - operate more than half of the country 's 40,000 cinemas			1
in a statement , @entity9 said it was delaying any showings of @entity20 because of ' the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats			1
@entity8 did not immediately comment on the news on wednesday			2
on tuesday , the studio told exhibitors that the company understood if they pulled the film in light of the threats			1
' due to the wavering support of the film @entity20 by @entity8 , as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats , @entity9 has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theaters , ' said @entity9 's @entity59			1
@entity9 is the country 's largest operator with more than 7,000 cinemas			1
@entity12 also has more than a 75 percent market share in @entity63 with 161 theaters with 1,639 screens			2
' @entity12 takes seriously its commitment to the freedom of artistic expression , but we want to reassure our guests and staff that their safety and security is our no. 1 priority , ' said a @entity12 spokesperson on wednesday			1
@entity13 , which operates 247 theaters across the country , was the first to cancel its planned showings of the film on tuesday			1
the fallout from the @entity8 hack that began four weeks ago exploded on tuesday after the shadowy group calling themselves @entity83 escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
extra precaution : @entity32 was spotted in @entity90 on tuesday night with his new giant bodyguard after @entity92 issued a chilling new threat warning of 9/11 - style attacks on movie theaters that show @entity20 a @entity97 vehicle outside the @entity98 in @entity90			1
it was supposed to be showing the @entity90 premiere of @entity20 on thursday , but the event has been canceled the @entity102 has said there was ' no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters , ' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group , dubbed @entity92			1
the theaters wo n’t play the film until the conclusion of an @entity113 investigation into the three - week - old cyberattack on @entity8 and subsequent terrorist threats , reports the @entity116			1
the warning did prompt law enforcement in @entity90 and @entity119 to address measures to ramp up security and thursday 's @entity90 premiere at the @entity123 was canceled as a result			0
@entity8 still plans to make the film available to theaters on @entity127 should they choose to exhibit it , although the company is now understood to be considering releasing the film on premium video - on - demand instead , reports @entity132			1
the move would allow the studio to recoup some of the film ’s $ 42 million budget and maximize the promotional exposure the film has received due to the threats			0
it would also enable the studio to experiment with the potential of @entity143			0
in @entity20 , @entity30 and @entity32 star as television journalists involved in a @entity35 plot to assassinate @entity37 leader @entity36			1
speculation about a @entity37 link to the @entity8 hacking has centered on that country 's angry denunciation of the film			1
trouble : @entity153 of @entity154 have said a terrorist attack could befall any theaters showing @entity20 , which stars @entity32 and @entity30 ( above ) over the summer , @entity37 warned that the film 's release would be an ' act of war that we will never tolerate			1

the film was slated to hit theaters nationwide on christmas day			0
it premiered in @entity119 last week			0
but on tuesday , @entity30 and @entity32 pulled out of all media appearances , canceling a @entity169 and @entity30 's planned guest spot thursday on @entity171			1
the @entity113 said it is aware of the @entity92 's threats and ' continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate this matter			2
' @entity113 director @entity177 last week said that investigators are still trying to determine who is responsible for the hack			0
@entity119 police chief @entity181 said his department takes the hackers ' threats ' very seriously ' and will be taking extra precautions during the holidays at theaters			2
security is seen outside the theatre at @entity190 before the premiere of the film ' @entity20 ' in @entity119 , @entity193 on december 11 , 2014 @entity194 studio @entity8 said on tuesday that it was not pulling the film , but is leaving it to theater chains to decide whether to show the movie , which depicts a fictional plot to assassinate @entity37 dictator @entity36			1
' we plan to release the film , ' said a source at @entity8 , which is dealing with fallout from an enormous cyber-attack last month			2
the source added that a decision whether to show the film ' is with theater owners , partners whom we support			0
' @entity92 also released a trove of data files including 32,000 emails to and from @entity213 ceo @entity212 in what it called the beginning of a ' christmas gift			0
' and two former @entity8 film production workers filed lawsuits alleging the @entity221 , @entity193 company waited too long to notify nearly 50,000 employees that data such as @entity225 numbers , salaries and medical records had been stolen			2
the filing follows another lawsuit this week from two other former @entity8 employees accusing the studio of being negligent by not bolstering its defenses against hackers before the attack			2
the @entity237 threat released on tuesday reads : warning we will clearly show it to you at the very time and places the interview be shown , including the premiere , how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to			2
soon all the world will see what an awful movie @entity8 has made			2
the world will be full of fear			0
remember the 11th of september 2001			0
we recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time			0
( if your house is nearby , you ’d better leave			0
) whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of @entity8			0
all the world will denounce the @entity213			0
it claims emails and other leaked information show that @entity8 's information - technology department and its top lawyer believed its security system was vulnerable to attack , but that company did not act on those warnings			1
@entity8 potentially faces tens of millions of dollars in damages from a class - action lawsuit , said @entity271 , an entertainment law professor at the @entity273 @entity272			2
since the hack surfaced late last month , everything from financial figures to salacious emails between top @entity8 executives has been dumped online			0
the nearly 32,000 emails to and from @entity8 ceo @entity212 leaked on tuesday include information about casting decisions and total costs for upcoming films , release schedules for @entity8 films through 2018 and corporate financial records , such as royalties from @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity292 music services			2

they also include budget figures for the @entity301 , of which @entity8 is a member , and at least one email about a senior @entity8 executive who left the company			0

' this will not take us down , ' @entity212 told employees , adding : ' you should not be worried about the future of this studio			0
