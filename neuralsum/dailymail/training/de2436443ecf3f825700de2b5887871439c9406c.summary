by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 12 june 2013 a @entity2 appellate court upheld the conviction of a domestic violence victim who was charged with a @entity6 after fleeing her husband while drunk			1
@entity8 appealed her conviction on the grounds that she was fleeing for her life from her abusive husband , but the @entity13 refused such a ' necessity defense ' on monday , saying @entity8 was risking her own injury and that of others by driving while intoxicated , according to @entity17			1
@entity8 was charged for driving while intoxicated and her license was revoked after she drove with a .18 blood alcohol level to flee her husband who had just hit her twice in the head			1
defense : @entity8 , left , said she drove while intoxicated because she was afraid her husband @entity22 , right , was going to hit her again shattered : @entity22 , left , was arrested after hitting his wife @entity8 and smashing her car 's windshield , right , when she tried to flee for her life the ' necessity defense ' is often applied in cases where victims injure their attackers or homeowners hurt intruders			1
to successfully use such a defense , @entity8 had to prove she had no option but to break the law and that she would have been injured if she did n't drive drunk			1
in may 2011 , she and and her husband @entity22 were on vacation when they got into a spat after drinking			0
they were at their family cabin near @entity40 , @entity2 , when mr @entity22 pushed his wife in the chest and hit her head twice			2
fearing more abuse , @entity8 got into the car and locked the doors			2
her husband climbed onto her car and smashed her windshield			0
thinking he might get in the car and hurt her , @entity8 drove away â€” even though she was drunk			1
someone called police and mr @entity22 was arrested for domestic assault and disorderly conduct			0
he pleaded guilty to both charges later			0
but @entity8 was also arrested and her license was revoked			2
while @entity8 's license has since been reinstated , she 's been trying to clear her record ' out of principle ' , @entity17 reported			2
the district court refused the necessity defense and the @entity13 upheld the district court 's decision on monday			1
reconciled : @entity62 , top left center , and her husband @entity22 , top right center , are back together and sober after mr @entity22 was arrested for domestic violence in the majority opinion of the court , judge @entity66 did acknowledge @entity8 was threatened with physical harm , but he concludes she only created more risk to herself and others by driving intoxicated			1
' @entity72 was threatened with physical injury by her husband , ' @entity66 said			0
' but , by driving while impaired , appellant created the very risk of physical injury to herself and to other highway users that the implied - consent statute is intended to prevent			0
' in a dissenting opinion , judge @entity80 wrote that ' @entity8 reasonably feared for her safety '			2
' a review of the district court record suggests that @entity8 had " no legal alternative to breaking the law , " " the harm to be prevented [ was ] imminent , " and " a direct , causal connection [ existed ] between breaking the law and preventing the harm , " ' @entity80 wrote			0
' ... i would therefore reverse the district court 's decision and remand for further findings on whether the facts of @entity8 's case meet the demanding requirements of the necessity defense			1
' @entity8 's attorney , @entity99 , is planning on filing an appeal with the @entity101			0
@entity8 and her husband have since reconciled and are both sober			1
she told @entity103 last summer that she still thinks she made the right decision			0
' i 'm alive today , ' she said			0
mr @entity22 also told @entity105 that if she did n't drive away , ' probably would 've hit her more ' .			0

a woman has lost her case arguing that she only drove after consuming alcohol because she was fleeing an abusive husband
@entity8 appealed the conviction but the @entity13 refused to accept her defense
