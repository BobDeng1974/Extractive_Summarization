by @entity0 published : 13:07 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 14:23 est , 15 january 2014 if you visited the promenade of @entity4 in the 1950s , you were likely to be greeted by six glamorous girls dressed in sharp - cut uniforms with a ' catwalk model poise ' and welcoming smile			1
they were called the @entity10 and were on hand to give directions , offer medical advice , or just brighten up the day of tourists to the @entity16 seaside town			1
now the marketing team at @entity18 are looking reinstate a 21st century equivalent - but this time men can apply too			1
they will also provide maps and information on the latest events and attractions			1
however , the new volunteers will be slightly less elegant than their predecessors - wearing branded polo - shirts and cagoules instead of air hostess style suits and specially designed handbags			1
the entry standards will also be less stringent thanks to modern equality and employment laws			1
in the @entity22 when sexism was rife , only attractive women could apply and had to be a minimum height of 5ft 7in			1
the girls posing on one of the rides at the @entity52			1
they had a strict code of conduct , and although they carried lighters they were not allowed to smoke themselves the launch of the new scheme has been welcomed by former @entity10 , who operated out of a caravan at weekends and carried cigarette lighters - but were not allowed to smoke themselves			1
@entity63 , from @entity4 , was a @entity64 for the 1956 tourism season having heard about the role while at @entity67			1
@entity68 , now 85 , was chief @entity69 in 1956 and 1957 and said the job was a pleasure she said : ' i think it ’s a very good idea to bring them back , although things are a lot different now from how they were then			2
' we used to help people with their chairs , posting their cards or if somebody got sunburnt or was not feeling well , telling them where they needed to go			2
' anyone doing it now will have to be quite knowledgeable			0
i think it will be a more difficult job than it was before			2
' they are going to have to be ready for just about anything and carry quite a bit of information with them			2
' @entity89 , who @entity4 ’s chief @entity69 in 1959 , said : ' every girl wanted to be a @entity64			1
it was like being a mini celebrity			0
' we were always being asked out			0
guys used to dare each other to ask us out			0
' mrs @entity89 said she was paid two guineas for a weekend ’s work and combined that with working at the @entity100 hotel			0
as well as giving out train times to tourists , the @entity10 were also used as hostesses and guides for foreign guests			1
one of the highlights of her summer was meeting pop star @entity108 at the @entity109			0
@entity68 , 85 , from @entity110 , @entity111 , was chief @entity69 in 1956 and 1957			0
she said : ' it was n’t hard work , it was pleasurable			0
we used to get a lot of queries , it was really quite something			0
' people would ask us all sorts of things , like what 's on at the cinema and we would be up to date with everything that was going on			0
' we would also get silly sorts of things like how many pebbles on the beach or what we were doing that night			0
it is a brilliant idea and just a pity it has not been brought back sooner			0
' the new volunteer scheme is part of a major shake - up of tourist information in @entity4			1
the new recruits will be stationed at key locations throughout the city including the @entity140 , the train station , and along the seafront			0
@entity18 said it is looking to ' harness some of @entity144 ’s sporting spirit ' by introducing its own band of on - street volunteers			1
recruits will need to commit to a minimum of six months , cover a variety of shifts including weekends , and be able to work for four hours at a time			0
in return , they will develop new skills with ongoing training , and at the end of their six - month stint will be given a certificate of recognition for their work			2
other benefits include free admission to some of the city ’s main tourism attractions and invitations to tourism - related openings and events			2
the @entity10 , who operated out of a caravan at weekends , were on hand to give directions , offer medical advice , or just to cheer up visitors @entity178 , chairman of the council ’s economic development and culture committee , said : ' this is a great opportunity for people to get involved and share their passion for the city with visitors			1
' the scheme runs successfully in other cities around the world and worked brilliantly in @entity189 during the @entity144			0
' the role of the @entity191 during the @entity144 shows how valuable volunteers can be			0
the volunteers will have the important role of welcoming visitors and responding to their enquiries			2
' late comedian @entity197 looks rather pleased to pose between two @entity10			1
the new volunteers will include men for the first time however unions raised concerns about the use of unpaid volunteers to step in where previously skilled members at the now defunct @entity207 , next to the @entity140 , that was closed in september to save money			0
@entity209 , of @entity4 and @entity210 , said : ' we do have concerns about people doing this on a voluntary basis with no real recompense			1
' we would n’t want to run down volunteering but it ’s better to have skilled paid people with good knowledge of what ’s available in the city for all the millions of visitors we have each year			2
' with most of that information centre team going , it is a case of cutting off our noses to spite our face			2
' we would have preferred to see if the people who benefit from the service , such as hotels , could be asked whether they would contribute to the costs of the centre			0
' successful applicants were trained at the @entity67 in @entity234 , @entity16			0
