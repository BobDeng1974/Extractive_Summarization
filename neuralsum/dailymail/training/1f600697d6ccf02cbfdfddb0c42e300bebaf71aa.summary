three @entity1 children have been sent to school with ' halal only ' badges taped to their uniforms after one of them was served @entity9 food in the canteen on ' eight or nine occasions '			1
@entity12 , five , has been given @entity9 food by staff at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , numerous times despite her parents writing to the school to express their beliefs			1
her mother , @entity21 , 29 , has now decided to take matters into her own hands and said she has taped the stickers to her children 's uniforms in ' protest '			1
she said : ' i really did n't know what to do anymore			0
' we have counted this happening on eight or nine occasions			0
they have only been attending @entity14 for over a year and a half now and yet this has happened a good few times			1
' my children are not the only pupils who eat halal food , which makes me wonder how many others have been given meals by mistake ? what if they had allergies ? ' the signs are the only way , other than a packed lunch , that i know my children will not be given @entity9 meals			1
' the " halal only " signs on the uniforms are a protest by me and my children , which is what i told the head teacher and that it will continue for as long as it takes			1
' mrs @entity12 said : '' the " halal only " signs on the uniforms are a protest by me and my children ' @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 ( pictured ) , has apologised to the family and said an investigation had been launched to establish why the mistakes with the school dinners had occurred mrs @entity12 and her husband @entity85 , 38 , said they took action after losing confidence in the school 's ability to prevent the dishes being served to their children			1
they said they wrote to the school and even went in to see staff on a number of occasions last year when @entity12 was served @entity9 food for her school dinner			1
halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade , while a @entity1 butcher recites a religious verse			2
all blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under @entity112 law			0
under @entity112 law , an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious			0
in comparison , the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed			0
it means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death , as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn - out pain and suffering			0
once the animal has been killed at the abattoir , it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered			0
on one occasion , it was her younger brother , @entity131 , who pointed out the mistake and the meal was switched			0
however , they said the breaking point came last week when the schoolgirl was again given non-halal food			0
they said their daughter has regularly been offered ham and crackers in the classroom and sent home with a bag of jelly sweets , which contain gelatine that is banned under @entity149 rules			0
both parents said that because their children are so young , they sometimes struggle to differentiate between halal and non-halal food , meaning they have to put their faith in the school to provide the correct option			1
the school , which is an independently - run academy , is provided the food by @entity160 , where meals are prepared off - site and separated for different dietary requirements			2
staff at the school are informed about which pupils should be given the specially prepared meals			2
@entity14 apologised to the family and said an investigation had been launched to establish why the mistakes have occurred			1
mrs @entity12 said : ' every time we complained to the school they say they are going to look into why this is happening , yet these mistakes keep happening			2
' i asked them does this happen to any of the other children , which they replied no. the concerned mother said her eldest daughter ( centre ) had been given @entity9 food up to ' nine times ' it is against @entity1 belief to eat @entity9 meat , which is slaughtered in a different way to @entity149 ( file picture ) ' this made me question whether someone is doing this on purpose			1
it has been quite stressful for us since we have moved to the area and i have even been to see the head teacher in tears			0
' we have never had any problems with the school and the kids all do well here			2
they just need to give the right meals to the right children			2
' the family also complained to @entity160 , who sent a letter informing them that staff would be given @entity149 awareness training			0
a spokesman for @entity14 said they regretted the incident and confirmed they are liaising with the @entity160 to undertake an investigation into their procedures .			1

@entity21 has sent her three children to school with ' halal only ' badges
she took action after @entity14 in @entity15 kept serving @entity224
the mother , 29 , said the *homemade* badges on their uniforms are a ' protest '
@entity14 apologised and said an investigation had been launched
