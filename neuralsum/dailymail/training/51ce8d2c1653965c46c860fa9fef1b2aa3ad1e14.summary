@entity0 last night turned a famous @entity2 slogan against president @entity3 by telling his opponent that @entity5 would not be diverted by peripheral issues this november : ‘ it ’s still the economy … and we ’re not stupid			1
’ the warning to @entity3 was a deft re-working of @entity11 ’s 1992 dictum , coined by his campaign chief @entity12 and hammered home at every opportunity in that election : ‘ it ’s the economy , stupid			1
’ @entity0 , who comfortably won five primaries in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , , @entity16 and @entity17 , used a victory speech in @entity23 , @entity24 – a key swing state and the first primary state @entity0 won – to shift the focus towards @entity3			1
victory : @entity30 presidential candidate , former @entity31 governor @entity0 and his wife @entity32 wave to supporters in @entity23 with @entity35 out of the race and @entity37 – who had hoped to win in @entity17 - expected to withdraw at any time , @entity0 has now been fully embraced by the @entity30 as their presumptive nominee			1
@entity37 once again hinted he might quit the presidential race last night after finishing nearly 30 points behind @entity0 in the one primary he hoped to win			2
mr @entity37 got just 27.1 per cent of votes in @entity17 – a winner - takes - all state where he had campaigned most vigorously for its 18 delegates			2
the former @entity49 told a small crowd in @entity51 , @entity52 : ‘ i want you to know over the next few days , we ’re going to look realistically at where we are at			0
’ the night before before mr @entity0 swept the board in @entity17 and five other states , mr @entity37 said he would ‘ take a deep look at what we are doing ’ after the results			1
he hinted that he would continue running until the may 8 primary in @entity52 , @entity59 reported			0
standing beside his wife , @entity61 ( pictured above ) , mr @entity37 also acknowledged that ‘ the results were clear enough ’ in @entity17			2
unlike @entity35 , who failed to endorse mr @entity0 when he quit the race last week , mr @entity37 also hinted that he may back the presumptive candidate			2
‘ i want you all to understand that governor @entity0 is going to have a very good night and it is a night that he has worked hard for , for six years , ’ he said			2
‘ and that if he does end up as the nominee , i think every conservative in the country has to be committed to defeating @entity3 and let ’s be very clear about this			2
’ ‘ four years ago @entity3 dazzled us in front of @entity76 columns with sweeping promises of hope and change , ’ he said			1
‘ but after we came down to earth , after the celebration and parades , what do we have to show for three and a half years of president @entity3 ? ‘ is it easier to make ends meet ? is it easier to sell your home or buy a new one ? have you saved what you needed for retirement ? are you making more in your job ? do you have a better chance to get a better job ? do you pay less at the pump ? ’ promising that he knew ‘ how to lead us out of this stagnant @entity3 economy and into a job - creating recovery ’ , he predicted ‘ a campaign of diversions , distractions , and distortions ’ over the next six months			1
‘ that kind of campaign may have worked at another place over in a different time			0
but not here and not now			0
it ’s still about the economy … and we ’re not stupid			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity5 have always been eternal optimists , but over the last three and a half years , we have seen hopes and dreams diminished by false promises and weak leadership			0
everywhere i go , @entity5 are tired of being tired			0
’ most polls show @entity3 slightly ahead of @entity0 but with the @entity30 having only just emerged from a bruising primary , his aides are confident that the president is eminently beatable			1
@entity3 is stronger among women and his ‘ likeability ’ numbers are healthier than @entity0 ’s			1
but the former @entity31 governor made clear he would not try to run a race about personal popularity or pretend to have the kind of magnetic appeal that @entity3 won with in 2008			2
he even predicted he would induce tedium among voters			0
‘ i ’ll probably start out talking about my wonderful wife @entity32 – i usually do – and i ’ll probably bore you with stories about our kids and grandkids			0
’ at the same time , he gave notice that he would push back hard against the notion that , as a venture capitalist with an estimated worth of more than $ 200 million , that he is a plutocrat out of touch with ordinary @entity5			1
‘ i ’ll tell you about how much i love this country , where someone like my dad , who grew up poor and never graduated from college , could pursue his dreams and work his way up to running a great car company			0
rally : @entity0 and his wife , @entity32 , take the stage at the election night event on tuesday before a cheering crowd uproar : returning to the state where a january primary victory propelled him to front - runner status , @entity0 delivered remarks glum : @entity37 addresses supporters with his wife , @entity61 , during a rally in @entity51 , @entity52			1

his wealth , he insisted , was hard - earned			0
‘ i ’d say that you might have heard that i was successful in business			0
and that rumor is true ' but you might not have heard that i became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people to hundreds of people			0
‘ you might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses , like @entity200 and @entity201 and a new steel mill and a learning center called @entity204			0
' and i ’d tell you that not every business made it and there were good days and bad days , but every day was a lesson			0
