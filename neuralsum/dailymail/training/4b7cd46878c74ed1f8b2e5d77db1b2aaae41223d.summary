the number of @entity1 paying inheritance tax is expected to rise by more than a third this year as house prices soar – and it will double in five years			1
at 40 per cent on the value of any estate above £ 325,000 , @entity1 has one of the highest rates of inheritance tax			1
it will be paid by one in ten people by 2018 , compared with just under one in 20 today , @entity10 forecasts claim			2
married couples are entitled to double the allowance , passing on assets of up to £ 650,000 to their children or other relatives free of tax			2
as shadow chancellor @entity19 announced a dramatic pledge to increase the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1million the tax was intended for the rich , but ministers have refused to raise the threshold in line with rising property values , which have gone up by 10 per cent a year in some areas			1
@entity28 and the @entity29 have been particularly badly affected , with the average property in the capital worth £ 450,000			0
figures from the @entity33 show 26,337 deaths led to estates being charged inheritance tax in the last financial year			1
this will rise by 35 per cent to 35,600 this year , and 43,800 in 2015 - 16			0
it is predicted to double by 2019			0
chancellor @entity19 has frozen the levy for the next three years , but tax experts and a growing number of @entity43 @entity42 have called for it to rise			1
in 2007 , the then shadow chancellor vowed to increase the threshold for the so - called death duty to £ 1million			2
senior backbench @entity48 said inheritance tax was hitting an ' increasing number of middle - income families ' the tax currently brings in £ 3.1billion a year , which will rise to £ 5.8billion by 2019			1
critics say it is unfair because it taxes assets such as homes bought with income that was already taxed			0
in most other developed countries it affects only the super-rich			0
the threshold in the @entity64 is £ 3.2million			0
@entity48 , chairman of the @entity65 of @entity43 backbenchers , said : ‘ these figures show that inheritance tax is now hitting an increasing number of middle - income families , people it was never intended to target			2
‘ given that most of the assets that are being taxed have been built up from people ’s earned incomes , on which they have already paid tax once , there is an obvious case to be made that it would be fair to look at this again			0
’ earlier this year @entity79 acknowledged that too many families were paying the levy and said this would be addressed in next year ’s election manifesto			0
but the @entity10 froze the threshold until 2017 - 18 to help pay for the new cap on the cost of social care for the elderly			0
housing accounts for about 50 per cent of the value of estates that attract inheritance tax			1
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ while we are having to pay off @entity96 ’s deficit couples can still leave £ 650,000 tax free and , importantly , freezing the inheritance tax threshold means we can pay to end the scandal of people having to sell their homes to pay for social care , meaning they often had no home to leave to their children and grandchildren in the first place			1

@entity19 froze level for death duties at £ 325,000 for the next three years
inheritance tax at 40 *%* kicks in on the value of an estate above this threshold
one in 10 expected to be hit by 2018 , compared with five per cent today
