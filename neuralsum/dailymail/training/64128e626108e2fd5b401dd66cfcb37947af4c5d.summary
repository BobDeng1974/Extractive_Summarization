by @entity0 a @entity1 adorned with commemorative d - day invasion stripes has been unveiled ahead of the 70th anniversary of the landings			1
the state - of - the - art jet has been specially painted with the famous black and white markings in tribute to the role of the crews of the @entity10 during the d - day operations			1
it took to the skies today at an unveiling ceremony at @entity15 in @entity16 alongside a similarly adorned @entity17 , which flew in the landings			0
an @entity19 @entity1 following a historic @entity17 during a fly - past at @entity15 both aircraft have been painted in special @entity23 black and white stripes on their wings the special paintwork made it easier to recognise the aircraft on @entity23 and reduce the chance of them being shot down by friendly forces @entity1 engines : 2 @entity33 turbojets power : 20,000lbs of thrust each @entity35 service ceiling : 55,000 ft length : 15.96m wing span : 11.09m weapons : missiles , 27mm cannon and 1,000lb bombs @entity10 engine : @entity44 24 cylinder power : 2,180hp @entity35 : 412mph service ceiling : 35,000 ft length : 9.73m wing span : 12.5m weapons : 4x20mm cannon			1
2x1,000lb bombs or eight rockets @entity23 veteran @entity54 was invited to today ’s event			2
the 92 - year - old , originally from @entity57 but now living in @entity58 , @entity59 , flew the @entity10 on @entity23			1
after the flypast , mr @entity54 , who joined the @entity19 as a boy apprentice in 1938 aged 16 and served with the force until may 1946 , said : ' it ’s been marvellous			0
the flypast was fascinating to see			0
it ’s a much faster aircraft with a jet engine where we had propellers			2
' talking about d - day , he said : ' the memory that stands out mainly in my mind is towards the end of a sweep around			1
i came down a country lane and i saw a horse and cart with a @entity80 soldier driving it and i thought " well i ca n’t kill the horse "			0
' ' the @entity10 was quite a heavy aircraft but it was still a nice aircraft to fly			2
' the @entity10 , nicknamed @entity10 , was one of the most effective fighter bombers during the @entity87			2
it was originally designed as a replacement for the @entity89 but it was initially considered a failure as a fighter			0
however , when it was used as a ground - attack aircraft it was found to be utterly devastating			0
the @entity10 was the first fighter that could carry two 1,000lb bombs and was equipped with four 20mm cannons			2
as a result , it was very effective as a train destroyer			0
it was also the first @entity100 fighter to be equipped with rockets			0
the last remaining @entity10 from the @entity19 museum collection has been loaned to @entity103 to honour the @entity105 pilots who served during the invasion of @entity107			0
the aircraft is normally a at the centre of the d - day exhibition at @entity111			1
the @entity1 will retain its striped paintwork during the summer 's airshow season to commemorate the d - day landings of june 6 , 1944 unlike the @entity17 , pictured , the @entity87 era @entity10 was a fighter bomber and was a devastating ground - attack aircraft the @entity118 could be equipped with bombs and rockets , which could not be carried by the @entity17 the modern @entity10 , like its @entity87 era namesake is a multi role aircraft with devastating firepower with a top speed of just over 400mph , the @entity10 formed part of the 2nd @entity126 that extensively supported ground operations during the d - day landings on june 6 1944			1
the alternating black and white invasion stripes were painted on the fuselages and wings of all @entity19 and @entity133 aircraft ahead of the landings to increase recognition by friendly forces			1
today the @entity10 ’s modern counterpart , the @entity1 , is powered by two @entity33 turbojets and can reach @entity139 1.8 , flying at up to 55,000ft ( 16,764m )			2
at a moment ’s notice they can launch and intercept unidentified aircraft in three locations : the @entity100 , @entity145 as part of the @entity147 mission - helping to protect and secure @entity147 airspace over the @entity151 nations of @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity145 - and in the @entity154			0
flight lieutenant @entity155 , who flew the @entity10 today , said : ' it was an honour to be able to fly in close formation with the @entity17 and to get both aircraft with d - day markings together			1
' i ’m proud to be part of the @entity19 and really proud to be able to fly and display this aircraft which commemorates d - day			1
' i think it ’s ( @entity23 ) one of those shocking parts of history			0
i ’m in awe of what people on the ground were doing supported by the @entity19 in the air			0
' flt lt @entity155 said the @entity10 and its modern - day counterpart were not too dissimilar			1
he said : ' the @entity10 is actually not too dissimilar to the @entity10 we have now with its role , which is a multi-role aircraft			2
' the @entity10 not only conducted air - to - air missions but also dive - bombing and air - to - ground missions as well			2
and that ’s exactly what the @entity10 does these days			0
' the commemorative @entity1 will fly in air shows across the @entity100 this summer			0
@entity133 air forces flew an astounding 14,674 during the first 24 hours of @entity182 , losing just 113 aircraft			1
much of those losses was attributed to friendly fire as the @entity186 was only able to launch 319 sorties			0
@entity19 @entity188 managed 294 sorties on d - day alone			1
@entity133 aircraft on @entity23 faced a greater threat from friendly fire than they did from the @entity80 @entity186 as they had comprehensive air superiority former @entity19 pilot @entity54 from @entity57 flew the @entity10 on d - day mr @entity54 said that his version of the @entity10 was ' quite a heavy aircraft but it was still nice to fly ' @entity10 pilot flight lieutenant @entity155 , right , said the modern version of the aircraft performed a similar role to the @entity87 fighter - bomber , pictured beside flight lieutenant @entity203 of the @entity205 memorial flight the @entity1 is deployed in the @entity100 , @entity145 and the @entity154			1

modern day fighter jet painted in d - day markings to commemorate the 70th anniversary of @entity182
