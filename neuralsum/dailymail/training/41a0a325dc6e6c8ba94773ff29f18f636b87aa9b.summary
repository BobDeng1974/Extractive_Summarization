by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 15 august 2013 a massive multimillion degree gas cloud has been discovered in a galaxy 60 million light years from @entity2			1
the cloud is likely to have been caused by a huge drawn - out collision between a dwarf galaxy and a much larger galaxy - and this collision could continue for another 50 million years			1
if this is confirmed , it will be the first time such a collision has been detected in @entity11 , and could help unlock the secrets of how galaxies grow			0
an image combining x-rays and optical light shows the scene of this collision			1
the impact between the dwarf galaxy and the spiral galaxy caused a shock wave - akin to a sonic boom on @entity2 - that generated hot gas with a temperature of about 6 million degrees the impact between the dwarf galaxy and the spiral galaxy caused a shock wave - similar to a sonic boom on @entity2 - that generated hot gas with a temperature of about six million degrees			1
the observations , made using @entity35 's @entity34 , show the hot gas has a comet - like appearance , caused by the motion of the dwarf galaxy			1
astronomers believe star formation may have been triggered by the shock wave , producing bright , massive stars			0
earlier this week , @entity35 detected in x-rays a planet outside our solar system pass in front of its parent star			2
the image was taken of a planet in @entity53 - a system which is 63 light - years from @entity2 - using @entity34 and the @entity56 ’s @entity55			2
up until now , exoplanets had only been observed passing in front of their parent stars using optical light in a process known as transiting			0
the planet , known as @entity64 , is a hot @entity65 , meaning it is similar in size to @entity65 in our solar system but in very close orbit around its @entity71 is more than 30 times closer to its star than @entity2 is to the sun and orbits its star once every 2.2 days			2
the observations , made using @entity35 's @entity34 ( pictured ) , could be the first time such a collision has been detected in x-rays the mass of the entire gas cloud is unknown because the two dimensional image ca n’t show whether the hot gas is concentrated in a thin pancake or distributed over a large , spherical region			1
the x-ray image shows the hot gas has a comet - like appearance , caused by the motion of the dwarf galaxy if the gas is a pancake , the mass is equivalent to forty thousand suns			0
if it is spread out uniformly , the mass could be much larger , about three million times as massive as the sun. according to @entity35 , the hot gas should continue to glow in x-rays for tens to hundreds of millions of years			1
they believe searching for large regions of hot gas in galaxies might be a way to estimate the frequency of collisions with dwarf galaxies and to understand how important such events are to galaxy growth			0
an alternative explanation is that the hot gas cloud could have been produced by supernovas and hot winds from large numbers of massive stars			0
however , @entity35 claims this is unlikely because of the lack of evidence of expected radio , infrared , or optical features			0
optical data from the @entity121 's @entity120 reveals the spiral galaxy in blue and white			0

potential collision was discovered in a galaxy 60 million light years away
the *resulting* cloud is thought to have a temperature of six million degrees
@entity35 estimates it could be three million times as massive as the sun
