by @entity0 last updated at 5:28 pm on 5th november 2011 it looks like the aftermath of a tropical storm , but this scene of destruction took place on a farm in @entity8 yesterday			1
a tornado uprooted trees and tore the roof of a stable as it swept past the village of @entity14 in the mid-afternoon			1
amazingly , the fierce winds threw the stable roof 20metres through the air before it came to rest stuck in the branches of a nearby tree			1
other trees were left broken in half at the @entity25 complex			2
twister : a tornado ripped the roof off a building and pulled up trees in @entity8 yesterday waterlogged : many roads in @entity32 became flooded on friday , like this one in @entity33 , after heavy rain incredibly , the storm passed over workers in a nearby office building , who did n't realise the extent of the damage until they stepped outside after it had finished			1
@entity43 , office manager at partitioning company @entity44 , which is based on the site , said that the storm seemed to ' last forever '			2
she said : ' it seemed like forever whilst it was happening , although it probably lasted less than a minute			2
' it was a bit of a grey day but you never expect something like that to happen , it was one of the worst storms i 've ever seen			0
' flooding : heavy rain in the south caused road closures in @entity60 yesterday weather experts believe the tornado may have been a funnel cloud , which can still cause destruction if it touches the ground			1
tornado sightings were also reported in nearby @entity67 at the same time			0
if not a washout , @entity68 looks set to be something of a damp squid as floods and torrential rain from last night give way to light rain mainly confined to @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
across remaining parts of the @entity81 it will be a dry night with mostly clear skies			0
@entity83 across @entity84 and @entity85 with a widespread ground frost and an air frost in places			0
mist and fog patches will develop too across parts of the north where winds are light			1
washout : floods and heavy rain may turn @entity68 parties being held over the weekend into wet events forecasters have warned			0

fierce winds leave trail of destruction in rural @entity8
