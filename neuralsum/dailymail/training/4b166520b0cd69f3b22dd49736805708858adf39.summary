by @entity0 and @entity1 five seals in @entity3 have been rescued after their necks became trapped in potentially fatal ropes , thanks to a new marine response unit			1
graphic images released on thursday show the full extent of the damage caused by the plastic ropes which cut into the mammals ' pelts and can cause the seals to die a slow , painful death from infection			2
the images , taken in december and january , show members of @entity20 's @entity19 saving the mostly young seals from entanglement			1
the second image shows a seal at @entity37 in @entity38 suffering because a piece of packing tape was choking its neck			0
it was rescued and pictured just weeks later happy and back in the wild , with a shaved patch on its head so it could be identified			0
the fourth and fifth images show seals on the timbers at @entity37 , with one pictured with a tight rope around its neck			2
seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers to relax in the sun , so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted			1
seals are very curious and they instinctively play with floating objects in the water , such as seaweed			2
but when they play with floating rope or plastic it can loop around their neck , and they have no way of getting rid of it			0
a seal at @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity3 , suffers from a tight piece of packing tape fastened around its neck the seal that was saved from choking on packing tape was pictured weeks after being rescued back in the wild			2
it had a shaved patch on its head so the @entity19 could identify it local tour boat operators often spot seals that have become tangled in plastic and report them to the @entity19			0
@entity20 vet @entity80 , who was involved in the rescue of the seal suffering due to packing tape at @entity37 , said the operations can difficult because seals duck into the water if humans try to approach them			2
' the only way to get hold of that seal is to anaesthetise it and the only way to do that is to dart it with a dart gun , ' dr @entity80 said			0
' often they 'll shoot it and the seal 's first instinct is to go in the water			0
' everyone needs to keep an extremely eagle eye on the animal in the water as it 's slowing down and becoming sedated to grab hold of it			0
' dr @entity80 said the rescues were very tricky and there was a lot of luck involved			0
a seal at @entity37 has a rope fastened tightly around its neck ' sometimes you 'll try and help a seal that 's entangled and it 's even possible that they will drown which is a horrible , but when the alternative is dying a slow death from infection from cutting wounds it 's preferred			0
' dr @entity80 said young seals often get entangled because they are so curious they inspect a lot of things in the water			2
but as they grow larger the plastic cuts into their pelts and can cause deadly infection			0
the new @entity19 was established in october last year and has since responded to more than 200 calls about wildlife caught in trouble			1
@entity137 and @entity139 @entity138 described the results as very positive for @entity3 marine wildlife			1
' to be able to respond to so many calls for assistance in our first season has been terrific , ' mr @entity138 said			0
seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers at @entity37 to relax in the sun , so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted ' we were able to save five seals from entanglement , but unfortunately there were also a number of cases involving entangled , sick , or injured seals that could nâ€™t be saved			1
' at the time of its launch , environment and climate change minister @entity157 said the unit aimed to protect and care for @entity3 's ' incredible marine wildlife			1
' the specialist unit is run of of @entity20 's @entity166 and head veterinarian dr @entity167 said the marine response department had addressed an important need by becoming the state 's first centralised point for marine wildlife welfare calls			1
most marine wildlife calls are made in spring and summer coinciding with yearling seals being forced by their mothers to become fully independent as they prepare to give birth in november and december			1
despite the work of the unit , some animals could not be save because of sickness , injury or entanglement			1

@entity3 marine wildlife response unit saved five entangled seals
the department has responded to more than 200 calls since december
some animals could not be save due to sickness , injury or entanglement
