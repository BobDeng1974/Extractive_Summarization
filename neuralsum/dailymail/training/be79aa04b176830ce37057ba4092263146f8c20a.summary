@entity1 officers have been using agency tools to keep tabs on their partner or spouse for at least the past decade , according to a @entity9 report friday			1
the spying is n’t often , but is has been given its own code name , according to the @entity9 , ‘ @entity12			1
’ instances of spying have averaged roughly one a year , a mere drop in the 3,000 violations of privacy rules a year bucket the spy agency recently disclosed			2
spy central : the @entity1 headquarters in @entity22 , @entity23 among the thousands of violations each year , there have only been a handful of wilful abuses of agency resources in the past decade , according to an @entity1 statement quoted by the @entity9 report			1
‘ @entity1 has zero tolerance for willful violations of the agency ’s authorities [ and responds ] as appropriate , ’ the statement said			0
