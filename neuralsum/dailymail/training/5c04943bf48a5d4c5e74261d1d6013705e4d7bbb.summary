by @entity0 towns and holiday attractions in @entity3 are worried that tourists will stay away this summer after the number of @entity7 beaches in the country plummeted to just one			1
in the sun : @entity11 , near @entity10 , will not be able to boast @entity7 status this summer this is a drop of 80 per cent on 2013			1
last year , five coastal strips in the region flew the prestigious marker of quality and cleanliness , and there are fears among those who rely on tourism from their income that potential visitors will be put off by the news			0
only @entity26 – a privately owned beach on the north coast of the @entity3 peninsula , near @entity10 – will have @entity7 status this year after @entity29 decided not to involve itself in the application process , arguing that it is too costly			1
beaches keen to boast the @entity7 stamp of approval have to apply each year – and pay for the privilege			1
it costs £ 820 for an inspection to deem whether a beach is up to scratch			1
a statement from @entity29 has defended its stance on the matter			0
pole position : @entity26 , which is privately run , will be the only @entity3 beach to boast @entity7 status in 2014 ‘ @entity29 , like other beach owners , has to pay to apply for @entity7 status , ’ it says			1
‘ consequently , we will not be applying for the @entity7 this season on any of the sites that formerly used to have the award – @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
’ @entity11 in @entity10 was also on the @entity7 list last year – bringing to four the number of coves which could be deemed to have reduced status in 2014			1
@entity56 , a town centre manager in @entity57 , where @entity50 is among the downgraded quartet , says that the council ’s decision is a disappointment			0
not included : @entity63 is a popular spot for families and surfers , and had @entity7 status last year ‘ we think it is very important , ’ he told the @entity68			1
‘ it is an internationally recognised standard , and a lot of people do take notice			0
’ he added that @entity57 may take charge of its own application next year to ensure that the standard of its beaches is acknowledged			2
@entity29 has signed up for a rival award this summer – and is keen to reassure potential visitors that its beaches are as clean as ever			2
‘ we will be replacing the @entity7 with a @entity85 on [ the beaches ] for the forthcoming season , ’ the statement continues			2
good enough for the pm : @entity90 and @entity91 took a short break at @entity63 last year ‘ it is however important to reassure beach users that we will not be reducing standards of service on any of our beaches and will strive , as always , to keep them clean , safe and healthy			0
’ in contrast to @entity3 , neighbouring @entity99 has eight blue flag beaches – four of them in @entity101			2
the @entity7 programme runs in over 40 countries across the world			0
in the @entity107 , it is administered by @entity108 – which argues that the award has worked wonders for the perception of the country ’s beaches			0
‘ over the years [ the programme ] has acted as an incentive to many beach managers to improve the quality of the coast , ’ the organisation explains			0
‘ their hard work has led to a revival of the @entity107 coastline and beaches around the world			0
’ surf 's up : @entity63 , on the north coast of @entity3 , is an excellent spot for surfing some 3500 beaches across the planet , in 41 countries , can claim @entity7 status .			1

number of @entity3 beaches with @entity7 status falls 80 per cent on 2013
@entity29 has decided not to pay for the £ 820 inspections this year
businesses in @entity57 and @entity10 are *concerned* tourists will stay away
