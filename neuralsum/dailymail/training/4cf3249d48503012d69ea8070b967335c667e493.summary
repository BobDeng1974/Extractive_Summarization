regarded by many as one of the seven natural wonders of the world , tourists travel from around the globe to take in the breathtaking view from edge of the @entity8			1
usually they can see for miles , gazing out across the 18miles - wide valley carved out by the @entity10 17 million years ago - but not today			0
a rare weather phenomenon has caused a thick sea of fog to rise from the foot of the canyon , sitting just yards from the top of the surface , creating an eerily beautiful effect			1
in scenes only usually seen when flying or from the top of world 's tallest mountains , the @entity8 appears to be sitting on top of the clouds			0
the rare weather system , which only happens about once every several years , has been caused by recent rains in northern @entity25			1
warm air at the top of the canyon stops the colder air at the bottom of the valley from rising , stopping the two masses of air from mixing			2
as the chillier air cools , dew caused by earlier the rain , which has now turned into fog , rises to the rim of the canyon , where the warmer air stops it from escaping			2
this is known as a ' total temperature inversion ' and only takes place at the canyon once every several years			1
in scenes usually seen when flying or from the top of world 's tallest mountains , the @entity8 appears to be sitting on top of the clouds a couple watch a sunset at the @entity8 , where the spectacular view was today blocked by a thick layer of cloud cause by a rare weather system despite the event only taking place around once a decade , tourists were treated to a similarly mesmerising sight at the @entity8 last year			1
the thick clouds are expected to linger in the canyon today , eventually clearing over the weekend as warmer weather returns , according to the @entity80			2
when the fog gathered this time last year , @entity8 park ranger @entity81 told @entity84 that some of the tourists visiting the canyon were disappointed they could n't see the @entity10 below , and just figured it was a normal weather pattern			1
but she and the other rangers tried to explain just how lucky they were to see the cloud - covered canyon , as locals turned out photograph the stunning view			0
' @entity93 spread like wildfire and most ran to the rim to photograph it			0
what a fantastic treat for all ! ' @entity97 said			0
unique temperature inversions are caused when cold and warm air weather patterns meet , with the most spectacular sights appearing when the system takes place over a valley or canyon			1
the cold air is sandwiched beneath the @entity108 's surface and the warmer air above , shortly after rain or snow leaves liquid water on the ground			0
this turns into dense fog , which rises as normal but is unable to escape because of the band of warm air at the top of the canyon			2
eventually the temperatures equalize , however this can take days , allowing the fog to rise further			0
more commonly , temperature inversions take place over cities , creating clouds of smog which can shut down urban areas to protect people from health risks			0

spectacular pictures show a sea of dense clouds filling the @entity8 because of rare weather system
temperature inversion causes colder foggy air to be trapped *underneath* a warmer band of air on surface of canyon
rare phenomenon caused an eerily beautiful effect , *astounding* tourists at the ancient valley in @entity25
