it was fitting and pleasing that @entity1 finished his managerial career as he 'd spent much of it - as a champion			1
with another winner 's medal around his neck , the veteran @entity6 coach once again found himself being thrown into the air by jubilant players on a field of glory			2
it was not as though @entity1 , well into his sixties and a @entity17 winner , had anything to prove when he decided to move half - way around the world to take charge of @entity23 club @entity22 in 2012			1
but his well - practised philosophy burned on , as did his desire to win things			0
and that 's precisely what he continued to do , adding three @entity30 titles , the @entity31 and the @entity32 to his already bulging trophy cabinet			1
@entity1 secured his third straight @entity23 league title and then immediately announced his retirement @entity1 won the @entity17 with @entity37 in 2006 , his side beat @entity38 in the final in @entity40 @entity1 , smoking one of his trademark cigars , talks to goalkeeper @entity43 after winning the @entity17 1995 : wins @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 with @entity48			1
1996 : @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 with @entity48			2
1997 : wins @entity45 and @entity47 with @entity48			1
1998 : wins @entity45 for third time with @entity48			1
2002 : wins @entity45 and @entity47 with @entity48			1
2003 : wins @entity45 and @entity47 with @entity48			1
2006 : wins @entity17 with @entity37			1
2012 : wins @entity30 and @entity31 with @entity22			0
2013 : wins @entity30 and @entity32			2
2014 : wins third consecutive @entity30 title			0
as another campaign ended in that familiar thrill of success , @entity1 , 66 , decided that it was time to call it a day			2
' i do n't want to coach any more , i 'm too old , ' he said after sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity63 , a result that won @entity65 the league for a fourth consecutive season			2
' it is my last match as a head coach for the club			0
@entity22 will have a new coach next season			0
' the silverware in @entity23 was a beautiful postscript to a stellar career - an extra star to take into posterity			2
@entity1 will continue to serve as their director of football , with the former @entity37 and @entity48 defender @entity82 favourite to take his job			1
@entity1 coached for 32 years , starting out in the @entity6 lower divisions and climbing the ladder to win five @entity86 and the @entity32 with @entity48			1
but he topped all that when he led @entity37 , against all expectations , to @entity17 success in @entity40 in 2006			1
in so doing , he became the first coach to have won both the @entity32 and the @entity17 , a feat later matched by @entity92 in 2010			1
as a player , @entity1 was a @entity96 - a sweeper - in the classic @entity6 tradition			1
between 1969 and 1979 , he played 274 league matches for @entity98			0
success was modest and @entity1 retired from playing at the age of 34 to embark on a coaching career			1
the year was 1982 , the year in which @entity37 won the @entity17			1
perhaps his later success was written in the stars			0
@entity1 will become technical director of @entity22 , the team he has been managing since 2012 @entity1 won five @entity45 titles with @entity48 as well as the @entity32 and @entity46 and @entity47 @entity1 in his familiar position in the dug - out while in charge of @entity110 the young coach served a thorough apprenticeship with some of @entity37 's less glamorous clubs , including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 before he rocked up at @entity120 in 1993			1
this was a club that had worshipped @entity123 just a few years earlier but had fallen on hard times			0
@entity1 restored some of their pride , defying a shoestring budget to guide them into the @entity129			0
it was an achievement that caught the eye of giants @entity48 , with whom he spent five seasons between 1994 and 1999 , guiding them to the pinnacle of both the @entity6 and @entity137 games			1
he forged a great @entity48 team - this was the era of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
@entity1 led them to the title in 1995 , 1997 and 1998			2
they lost the 1995 @entity129 final to a @entity153 - inspired @entity152 but roared back to claim the @entity32 12 months later , beating @entity154 on penalties at the @entity156 in @entity157			2
@entity48 were the example for every @entity137 team - they were united , hard working , organised and deadly on the counter-attack			2
@entity1 celebrates winning the @entity6 league with @entity163 at the @entity164 in 2003 @entity166 's second spell in charge of @entity37 was less successful , with the @entity37 collapsing at the 2010 @entity17 @entity48 @entity45 : 1994 - 1995 , 1996 - 1997 , 1997 - 1998 , 2001 - 2002 , 2002 - 2003 @entity46 : 1995 @entity168 : 1995 , 1997 , 2002 , 2003 @entity169 : 1996 @entity50 : 1996 @entity51 : 1996 @entity22 @entity30 : 2012 , 2013 , 2014 @entity31 : 2012 @entity32 : 2013 @entity37 @entity17 : 2006 @entity175 's @entity174 , feeling their way back into @entity172 's top competition as they started to dominate the @entity173 , had the misfortune to encounter @entity166 's @entity48 in consecutive seasons			1
their september 1996 meeting at the @entity164 was men against boys as @entity48 peppered @entity182 's goal			0
it was miraculous @entity174 only lost by one , as they also did at @entity184 later that season			0
' @entity48 were an example for my @entity174 , ' @entity175 later revealed			0
' i had my players watch videos of @entity1 's team and would say : ' do n't look at the tactics or technique , we had that too ; you need to learn to have that desire to win			0
' indeed , @entity1 outlined his coaching philosophy in a book called a game of ideas : thoughts and passions from the sidelines			0
he emphasised togetherness and team spirit			0
a team could be greater than the sum of its parts			0
he likened a playing squad to a family , stressing the importance of everyone getting along			0
despite that early success , they fell short in @entity172 too - losing 3 - 1 to @entity214 in the 1997 final in @entity216 and 1 - 0 to @entity217 in @entity218 a year later			0
@entity1 smoking a cigar on the training field with @entity37 ahead of a @entity17 qualifier in march 2005 the legendary boss contemplates the @entity17 trophy prior to the 2006 final in @entity225 @entity1 walks with friend sir @entity175 prior to a charity match at @entity184 in 2007 celebrating with @entity227 after @entity48 secured the @entity228 on the final day of the 2001 - 2002 season even @entity174 finally conquered them - in the 1999 semi-finals - but by that time @entity1 had departed and @entity231 was in the opposition dug - out			1
after an unsuccessful season at @entity110 , @entity1 returned to @entity234 in 2001 , winning the @entity235 at the first attempt on a dramatic final day			1
he guided them to a fourth @entity32 final 12 months later , only for @entity110 to win on penalties at @entity184			1
the truth is that @entity1 could have won more			2
he was appointed manager of @entity37 in 2004 , replacing @entity241			2
they approached the 2006 @entity17 at a low ebb as sordid details emerged of the @entity246 scandal , in which @entity1 was questioned but cleared			1
despite such low expectations , @entity37 prospered , beating hosts @entity40 in a classic semi-final in @entity214 and then defeating @entity38 on penalties in the @entity225 final , forever remembered for @entity145 's headbutt on @entity253			0
@entity1 keeps a close eye on @entity255 during a 2009 training session with @entity37 in @entity257 @entity1 celebrates @entity259 's winning goal in their december 1997 meeting with @entity174 in @entity234 @entity175 had got the better of @entity1 at @entity184 earlier that season with a 3 - 2 win it was a quite astonishing success and @entity1 celebrated in his own inimitable way , by watching a re-run of the whole match alone in his hotel suite while smoking a victory cigar			1
with hindsight , @entity1 should have ended on a high right there and then			0
he returned to lead to @entity37 at the 2010 finals in @entity273 but the team were a shambles			0
they drew with @entity277 and @entity278 before losing to @entity279 , recording their worst @entity17 performance since 1966			0
@entity1 resigned after the @entity279 loss			0
that led to his final chapter in @entity284 which is now drawing to a close			0
the curtain closing on a quite extraordinary career that saw @entity1 enjoy sustained success with a coaching philosophy that will endure as a manual for managers the world over .			0

@entity1 retired from football management at the *weekend*
the 66 - year - old said he was ' too old ' to carry on as @entity284 manager
@entity1 made *announcement* after securing his third @entity23 league title
the @entity6 won the @entity17 , @entity32 and five @entity45 titles
