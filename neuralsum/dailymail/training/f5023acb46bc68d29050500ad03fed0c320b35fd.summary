the woman accused of abandoning her down syndrome son has hit back at her husband 's claims and said she had to make a ' ruthless decision ' in the best interests of the child			2
@entity7 gave birth to baby @entity9 on january 21 in an @entity11 hospital but within hours , she had allegedly filed for divorce from her husband @entity13 after he refused to give up on their child			1
she became a hate - figure around the world after @entity13 claimed his wife of eighteen months handed him an ultimatum : her , or his newborn son			1
but an angry @entity7 has now disputed his version of events and said the couple had agreed that baby @entity9 would have a better quality of life if he was raised in his father 's native @entity26			1
it read : ' 21 january was the happiest day for me , as i finally gave birth to my long - awaited son			1
our son was born at 6.30 in the morning and i remember alarmed faces around and doctors worried looks			2
i woke hours after anaesthesia			0
' my first question was about the whereabouts of my child			0
i remember the sad faces of my relatives and the doctors and the diagnosis that sounded like a verdict : '' your child was born with a @entity30			0
'' one can never imagine my feelings at that moment ' hardly had i recovered from the first shock , when the doctor approached me and told me to voice my decision whether i was going to keep @entity9 or not			1
i had to make the most ruthless decision in my life within several hours			0
' the first thing that came to my mind after the diagnosis was that i do n't want my child to live in a country where certain stereotypes dominate the lives of people with @entity30 and no opportunities at all			0
i want him to be involved and well - received in society , an integration that will require years and years for our society to adjust to			0
' i saw the evasive looks of the doctors , my relatives ' tear - stained faces , received calls of condolences and realised that only a move to a country with such standards as @entity26 would entitle my son to a decent life			1
happy day : @entity7 ( left ) pictured at her wedding alongside her sister @entity96 happier times : the couple have only been married 18 months but are now locked in a bitter battle over their son 's future @entity13 ( right ) , who runs an online business in @entity11 's capital @entity105 , pictured with @entity7 's brother @entity106 ' this fact was not disputed by my spouse either , who occasionally claims in his articles that the baby ca n't afford the life he deserves in @entity11			1
thus , i spent the hours after @entity9 's birth trying to collect my will and decide on the best destiny for the kid			1
' everyone in our family realised that the baby 's interests should be placed first and only his move to another country could remedy the situation , something that @entity13 himself also accepted			1
' i understood that in @entity11 , where is no extensive social infrastructure to help children with developmental disabilities , no governmental support , with the continuous hard economic situation in the country , with the possibility of renewed war with our hostile neighbour -- with whom the fragile cease - fire seems to be deteriorating over time -- always looming in the background , with my salary of 180 $ being partly supported by my sister and living in my mother ’s place and having no other income , as my husband did not work , i would not be able to raise my child with special needs			2
' in @entity11 every child is loved and respected and family is a high value , but in this country children with special needs do require special attention , huge financial resources and dedication			2
' in the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision , i could not find any support from his side			0
' after that incident , he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him , that he is going to leave the country for @entity26 and i do not have anything to do with the situation			1
' without giving me any option and trying to find with me any solution in this hardest situation , he started to circulate the story on every possible platform without even trying to give me a voice accusing that i put him an ultimatum marriage or the baby , which is absolutely not true			2
wedding : @entity13 and @entity7 are pictured here on their wedding day - but the couple are now arguing over what they had agreed was best for their son ' i tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions			1
the only response was the accusation from his part			0
@entity13 has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country			2
' neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce			0
the only thing he kept saying was that he did n't want us to separate , whereas my question what we should do always remained unanswered			0
' as a mother who has faced this severe situation , being in the hospital under stress and depression , experiencing enormous pressure from every side , not finding any support from my husband ’s part on any possibilities of giving a child decent life in @entity11 , i faced two options : to take care of the child on my own in @entity11 , or to abandon my maternal instincts and extend the baby an opportunity to enjoy a decent life with his father in @entity26			1
i went for the second option			0
' in a further twist today , @entity13 has now said he forgives his wife and that he understands the pressure that exists in @entity7 's home country			1
speaking to the @entity228 , he said : ' i do n't hold anything against @entity7			0
i wanted this personal responsibility and i 've assumed it for @entity9 and she 's also made her own decisions			2
' i am fully sympathetic about the societal pressures and issues with the culture			0
there are many factors that come into play			0
' he also said that he still believes the couple have a future together and added : ' i adore her and i want to carry through those memories for @entity9			1
i want him to know how good his mum was			0
i 'll hold out the possibility in the future that there will be the possibility of a connection			0
inspirational : @entity13 claimed his wife refused to look at or even touch her son because @entity11 culture believes a child with a condition like @entity30 brings shame on the entire family ' the door will always be open			1
for that to happen she will need to fully accept @entity9 and take on her responsibilities as a mother			2
' @entity13 , who runs an online business in @entity11 's capital @entity105 , claimed that @entity7 and her family were ashamed of @entity9 's condition and had decided to abandon the child without consulting him first			1
but @entity7 hit back at those claims and said : ' i tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions			0
the only response was the accusation from his part			0
flee : @entity13 has now raised more than $ 440,000 via his crowdfunding page as he seeks to bring @entity9 back to his native @entity26 ' @entity13 has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country			1
neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce			0
' @entity13 claimed his wife refused to look at or even touch her son because @entity11 culture believes a child with a condition like @entity9 's brings shame on the entire family			1
when @entity9 was born , @entity283 said he was n't immediately allowed to see his son or wife			1
he said : ' this paediatrician walks out of the room with a little bundle ... she had his face covered up and hospital authorities would n't let me see him or my wife			2
' when the doctor came out , he said ' there 's a real problem with your son '			0
' @entity283 said he was shocked when doctors initially told him of @entity9 's @entity30 , but it never crossed his mind to abandon him			2
he added : ' they took me in to see him and i looked at this guy and i said , he 's beautiful , he 's perfect and i 'm absolutely keeping him			0
' the first - time father set up a webpage to crowd fund as he tries to flee the eastern @entity306 country so he can raise @entity9 back in his native @entity26			1
the fundraising page , titled @entity308 , has already raised more than $ 440,000 , leaving @entity13 stunned by the outpouring of support .			2
