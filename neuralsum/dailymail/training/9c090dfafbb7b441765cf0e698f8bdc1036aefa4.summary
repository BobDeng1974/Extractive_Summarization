@entity6 , who is 23 months old , ( pictured , left , with his mother @entity17 ) suffered a serious burn after placing the palm of his hand ( right ) on the metal sculpture which had got hot in the sunshine in the week since he has had to return to hospital twice to have his dressings changed and undergone a preliminary examination from a plastic surgeon			1
the accident took place in @entity26 , @entity27 , where the large metal sculpture forms part of a public art trail around the marina development			1
children often climb on the artwork and on her website the artist encourages families to interact with the work			2
but ms @entity12 , 42 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , said warnings should be put up that the sculpture can become hot			1
she said : ' we always walk around @entity45 , it is a very popular spot for families			0
' children are always attracted to new things and we walked near to the large metal structure			2
the accident took place in @entity26 , @entity27 , where the large metal sculpture forms part of a public art trail around the marina development ' @entity6 put his hands on it in the same way you would with a wall and all of a sudden he started to cry			1
' i looked at his hand and it had already blistered , the skin had come off and it was very , very nasty			1
' there is no warning , nothing that says the surface may be hot			2
' at home i am always very sharp with my children around hot surfaces , but this is something that was unforeseen and i worry for other families ' - @entity73 ' young children like to explore and the sculpture looks like it is part of a children ’s playground as it sits on the same tarmac			1
i have seen children playing there			0
' the pictures on the artist ’s website even show children and families playing in and around the structure			0
i think it is very dangerous			0
' ms @entity12 went on to say : ' it ’s very hard because @entity6 is so young and those are the parts of the hands you use to explore at that stage			2
this has been a very bad experience			0
' at home i am always very sharp with my children around hot surfaces , but this is something that was unforeseen and i worry for other families			2
' @entity99 said the artwork was not owned by them , and was under the ownership of developer @entity102			0
the steel sculpture , called @entity105 , is the work of artist @entity107 and was installed in 2009 as part of a public art programme			0
the sculpture is designed to reflect the colour of the town ’s old roofs and changes colour in response to the weather			0
