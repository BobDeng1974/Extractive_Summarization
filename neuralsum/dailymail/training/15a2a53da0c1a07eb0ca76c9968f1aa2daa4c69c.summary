the magic of the @entity1 is n't always as magical as supporters might like			1
but this year 's fourth round had more than enough shocks to justify the cliché for another year at least			2
both of the @entity8 's top two clubs were knocked out while @entity9 failed to score against minnows @entity11 and @entity12 stumbled at home to @entity14			1
here , @entity16 's @entity15 looks back at the highs , lows , heroes and zeros			2
@entity22 players celebrate after beating @entity23 4 - 2 at @entity24 on saturday afternoon all bets off as bradford @entity25 it was much like most sundays for @entity22 boss @entity27 as he set out to watch son @entity28			1
but some things were certainly not normal in the @entity31 village			0
there was the @entity34 camera crew , for a start , and his phone buzzing continually with messages of congratulation			0
and an invitation to appear on @entity40			0
this is what happens when your @entity44 team knocks @entity23 out of the @entity1 , but @entity22 ’s was not the only surprise on a weekend when the @entity47 humbled the @entity8			1
no - one saw it coming , except perhaps the 24 - year - old @entity51 plumber who won nearly £ 3,000 with a tenner bet on @entity22 and @entity53			1
most wagers were destroyed by @entity22 or @entity53 , winners at @entity56 , or @entity57 , who beat @entity59 , or @entity14 , who drew at @entity61 , or @entity62 , who held @entity64 , or @entity65 — who earned a replay against @entity9			1
@entity53 striker @entity68 celebrates after scoring for his side against @entity56 @entity71 ’s @entity1 replay against @entity72 will be their 15th cup game of this season coming soon after the @entity77 semi-final , second leg against @entity78 on wednesday — their seventh game in that competition			1
there have also been two games in the @entity83 , and the replay against @entity72 will be their sixth @entity1 match of the season			1
defender @entity87 has appeared in all 13 so far , starting a dozen and coming off the bench at @entity90 on saturday			2
@entity87 has made 35 appearances already this season			0
a parting shock from @entity94 is it wig - an or is it @entity97 ? no , it ’s former @entity99 and @entity23 star @entity100 sporting an odd new hairdo when he appeared as a pundit on @entity104 ’s @entity103			1
@entity106 observers compared him to a character from @entity109 or @entity110 from @entity111			0
@entity100 's haircut created a storm on @entity106 after his appearance as a tv pundit on @entity103 there were some cold spots amid their warm glow of affection for the famous old trophy			0
what was going on at @entity57 , for example , where fewer than 6,000 turned up for the lunchtime kick - off ? perhaps they stayed at home and picked it up on @entity127 , but they missed the thrill of witnessing referee @entity130 take his red - card tally to seven in 15 games as two former @entity134 players , @entity135 and @entity136 , ended @entity59 ’s @entity1 hopes			1
fewer than 6,000 people turned up to watch @entity57 win against @entity59 hero @entity27 for having the courage to play open and aggressive football at @entity24 and refusing to change tactics when @entity22 went two down			1
his players responded to create one of the biggest @entity1 shocks ever but @entity147 , after leading his team to the @entity77 final , is proving once again that there are talented @entity150 coaches working in the @entity47			1
zero @entity151 for his sour response to @entity11 ’s heroics , moaning about the pitch , the referee , while refusing to acknowledge rival boss @entity156			2
it was a sharp contrast to @entity158 at @entity23 , who shared drinks with @entity22 ’s staff despite being choked by his defeat			1
@entity27 ( left ) was the weekend 's hero while the ungracious @entity151 ( right ) was the zero @entity65 heroics help fire up the fans @entity11 sparked all that weekend drama by resisting @entity9 on friday			1
the goalless draw was watched live on @entity166 by an armchair audience of more than seven million			0
then , more than 300,000 climbed off their sofas , pulled on hats and scarves and chicken costumes — whatever was to hand — to attend the 11 ties on saturday , including some vast armies of travelling support			0
six thousand @entity22 fans will never forget their day out at @entity23 , while the 5,500 @entity179 fans who saw the latest instalment of @entity181 ’ s resurgence was apparently their largest away following in seven years			1
@entity14 provided 60 free coaches to ferry fans to @entity61 , while nearly 6,000 @entity186 supporters made the short trip south to derby as almost 29,000 enjoyed the first county derby since 1986			0
it was a close - fought contest which proved football in @entity191 is in rude health			2
@entity65 , by the way , have been offered 9,000 tickets for next week ’s replay at @entity196			0
it will be interesting to see if the @entity198 stick with their story , or are tempted by possible upsets elsewhere , like @entity12 at @entity14 or @entity64 at @entity62			0
@entity11 's draw with @entity202 was watched by seven million people on @entity166 @entity205 's decision to rest so many first - team regulars was perhaps the most puzzling decision of the weekend , though @entity59 ’s boss will feel his side would have won had they not been at least one man short for most of the game			1
none of the @entity77 semi-finalists won as they tinkered with rotation			0
@entity78 and @entity23 made nine changes and lost at home			2
@entity71 and @entity12 drew , after making eight and five changes respectively			2
@entity221 boss @entity220 , fielding a full - strength xi at @entity219 , said the fourth round was ‘ the most astounding weekend ever ’ in @entity1 history			1
@entity59 defender @entity224 was sent off by referee @entity130 in just the seventh minute of play @entity226 wanted list @entity14 goalkeeper @entity227 produced a fabulous display at @entity61 and his timing could barely have been better			0
@entity12 are one of the clubs monitoring @entity227 , aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting @entity14 ’s efforts to re-sign			0
the 27 - year - old @entity236 was making only his second appearance since august and he responded with an array of brilliant saves to frustrate @entity12 and secure a lucrative replay for the @entity242 club			2
he has kept clean sheets in two @entity1 ties , which will alert more clubs to his availability on a free transfer in the summer			2
several @entity249 clubs had scouts in the @entity61 crowd			0
@entity14 rejected a bid of £ 1.2million last summer from @entity253 , who are still keen			0
@entity255 and @entity256 are also watching and there is interest from clubs in the @entity8 , including @entity260			0
@entity14 goalkeeper @entity227 produced a fabulous display at @entity61 @entity12 are one of the clubs monitoring @entity227 , aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season			0

the magic of the @entity1 appeared to be back after a brilliant weekend
@entity22 came from behind to beat @entity23 4 - 2 at @entity24
@entity56 were beaten by @entity53 at the @entity272
@entity9 drew 0 - 0 with @entity11 on friday
