@entity0 cranked up his war of words with @entity3 by declaring himself ' willing to die ' in order to put an end to the decade - long feud with his @entity8 welterweight enemy			1
there are few more bitter rivalries in world boxing than the one between 28 - year - old @entity0 and @entity13 's @entity3 , who both now campaign at the 147lb limit but are yet to face each other in the ring , with the exception of a heated sparring session			1
but @entity0 strengthened his chances of landing a money - spinning clash with @entity3 by winning the @entity23 title in august , via decision against @entity26 @entity25 , and has continued to call him out since			1
@entity0 poses with his @entity23 welterweight belt after his first defence against @entity29 was announced @entity0 hopes he can set up a @entity8 super-fight against @entity3 for later in the year the 28 - year - old explained : ' i 'm the champion so he should be chasing me now			1
but the reason why i 'm still mentioning him is because since i was 18 years old when i turned professional , every conversation and interview i 've had his name has always come up			2
' i want to put it to bed and prove to everyone in @entity8 that i 'm no 1			2
even though i am the no 1 in the world i want to show that he 's not on my level			2
' the night i fight @entity3 , a bit of my soul will be left in that ring			1
i 'm willing to die in that ring just to prove all of this talk right			2
i will be leaving a bit of me in that ring that night			2
' @entity0 's promoter , @entity52 , offered @entity3 £ 3million to fight his charge last year and revealed in his @entity55 column that he would be willing to offer him even more to make the fight in 2015 and has even booked @entity57 in the summer with that showdown in mind			1
@entity52 agreed late on wednesday night for @entity0 to face @entity61 - based @entity60 @entity29 in the first defence of his title in @entity64 on march 28			1
what 's more , @entity29 is @entity0 's mandatory challenger which means he will be free to pursue any fight he chooses once he takes care of the @entity23 's allocated @entity69			1
@entity0 celebrates beating @entity25 in @entity70 to win his world title last summer brook was stabbed while on holiday in @entity74 and feared he may never fight again a voluntary defence in march would have left @entity76 obligated to fight @entity29 in the summer which would have ended hopes of an all - @entity8 megafight with @entity3 in june , which could generate the same nationwide appeal as @entity82 's fight with @entity83 at @entity57 last may			1
but first @entity0 must take care of @entity29 and he admits it is easy to look past him , with such lucrative fights on the horizon			1
he conceded : ' it is difficult because you look at those massive names and massive fights that you 've dreamed of as a young kid growing up			0
' but i 'm among them now			0
there are three men out there with belts in this division – one is @entity100 , one is @entity102 and one is @entity0			2
i 'm at the highest table in the hottest division and can be involved in some massive fights			0
' but you 've got to take care of business , if you do n't get past this obstacle in front of you , you know you wo n't get to those fights			0
you 've just got to concentrate on what is in front of you			0
' the homecoming fight at @entity64 's @entity116 will be tinged with emotion as it will be @entity0 's first outing since an horrific machete attack during a holiday to @entity74 in september left him fearing for his life			1
@entity3 ( right ) delicered his best performance to date against @entity122 in @entity123 last month but after making a full recovery , @entity0 says he is using the trauma to spur him on			1
he said : ' i remember being laid in @entity74 being next to a red - hot window and nobody in the hospital even speaking @entity130 and i was there with my leg tied up thinking ' will i ever walk again ? ' ' from winning that world title , going from cloud nine to laying in that hospital bed it has been a rollercoaster			1
but the fact is , i 'm here now and it 's been a long time			0
but i 'm back now at 100mph doing everything i could before the attack			0
' i 've put it behind me			0
it was a chapter of the @entity0 story and now i do n't let it get to me			2
i turn a negative into a positive			0
i 'm lucky to be here and looking at my kids			0
i 'm fit and well and i will get on with what i 've got to get on with			0
' the knife attack has really pushed me on but it is about earning a few quid now			0
i want to prove to everyone that it was not a fluke or a one - off , i 'm the real deal			0
i was born for this			0
' @entity29 earned his shot at @entity76 by becoming the @entity23 's mandatory challenger to the title			1

@entity0 says he will leave something in the ring when they do meet
