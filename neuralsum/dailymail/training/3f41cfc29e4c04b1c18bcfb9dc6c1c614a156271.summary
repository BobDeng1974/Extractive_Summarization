by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 27 september 2012 final bid : cleric @entity2 has made yet another plea to the @entity4 to stay in @entity5 but it is likely to fail hate preacher @entity2 was accused of ‘ playing the system ’ last night after his lawyers launched another legal bid to block his extradition			1
the hook - handed cleric ’s legal team got a court ruling preventing him from being sent to the @entity14 while the latest application is dealt with			1
it is thought they will argue his physical and mental health has deteriorated so much that he is not fit to stand trial on terror charges			2
@entity22 sources said @entity2 ’s legal team – who have already earned more than half a million pounds in legal aid from representing him – were ‘ playing the system ’			1
a source added : ‘ we ’re still confident he ’ll be out of the country soon			0
’ @entity31 officials have predicted it will take two to three weeks to arrange @entity2 ’s removal from the country and into the custody of @entity14 marshals			1
@entity2 was told on monday that his appeal to the @entity38 had failed			1
he had claimed that a potential jail term of up to 50 years without parole would breach his human right to be protected from ‘ inhuman or degrading treatment ’			0
in april the @entity38 rejected that claim , but he was given a further right of appeal			0
he asked the court ’s highest body , the @entity38 , to reconsider , but that was rejected on monday night			2
he took his case to @entity50 following years of delays caused by countless legal challenges in this country – all of which failed			0
worshippers : @entity2 ( pictured centre , wearing blue ) preached hate on the streets of @entity5 the basis of cleric @entity2 's latest appeal to the @entity4 has not yet been revealed , with the @entity63 only confirming the preacher and one other terror suspect are ' seeking injunctions preventing their removal from the @entity5 '			1
@entity2 's application has stopped the extradition process - but only very briefly - as his request for an injunction will be considered on tuesday			1
if he loses , the government 's target of getting him on a plane to the @entity14 within two weeks will still be on track			2
if he wins , then the legal process will begin again , with the @entity31 sure to appeal the decision			0
whatever @entity2 's taxpayer - funded legal team argues next week , they have to prove to the judge that there has been a ' new and compelling ' change in the cleric 's argument to stay , which crucially has not been considered in the eight years of cases that have cost the taxpayer millions and clogged up the courts since his conviction for soliciting murder and racial hatred in @entity5			1
legal experts have suggested his latest act will be futile , and he is ' playing the system ' and ' very unlikely ' to prevent his extradition to @entity14			0
the @entity4 said the case for his removal was ‘ unassailable ’			0
the @entity14 authorities want to put @entity2 on trial for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in @entity100			1
he is also accused of taking part in a kidnapping plot in the @entity103			0
his notoriety in this country comes from his fanatical sermons delivered outside the @entity108 mosque in @entity109			2
he is credited with turning dozens of young men to his radical and hate - filled ideology			0
since 2004 , he has been held in the high - security unit at @entity113 – the so - called ‘ prison within a prison ’ – at a cost to taxpayers of about £ 50,000 a year			1
a hearing on whether the extradition should be blocked will be held next tuesday , before sir @entity120 , president of the @entity122 , and mr @entity123			0
a second terror suspect , @entity124 , whose case was dealt with in @entity50 at the same time as @entity2 ’s , has also launched an appeal			1
@entity124 is wanted for his alleged involvement in the bombing of @entity14 embassies in @entity130 and @entity131 in 1998			2
he faces more than 269 counts of murder			0
a @entity31 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity38 ruled there was no bar to the extradition of these men			0
’ wanted man : @entity14 authorities have called @entity2 ' a terrorist facilitator with a global reach ' hook : radical muslim clerk @entity144 allegedly lost an eye and had both hands blown off by a mine in @entity148			2

he and terror suspect @entity124 are again trying to avoid getting thrown out of @entity5
this is despite a @entity154 ruling essentially ending their chances this week
@entity2 's application will cost taxpayers at least £ *10,000*
it will take place in open court next tuesday in central @entity109
