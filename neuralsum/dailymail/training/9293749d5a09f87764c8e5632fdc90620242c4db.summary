by @entity0 one man from @entity2 caught an 11 - foot - shark weighing 805 pounds that may just break the world record for land - based shark fishing for makos			1
last tuesday night in @entity8 of @entity9 , @entity2 wrestled with the monster mako shark and at times used almost 900 yards of fishing line from his reel			1
' she was pulling line out of my reel at easily 60 miles and hour			0
we call that ' smokin ' the drag ' round here , ' said @entity8			0
' we tried to revive the fish and send him back out , but he was too worn out to swim , ' the 29 - year - old @entity8 said			1
' that 's why we decided to keep him			0
we do n't do it for the money , for the publicity , just to catch the fish , ' he told the @entity36			1
' it was really good , ' @entity8 told the @entity36 on monday			0
' it 's not real fishy			0
it does not have a real gamy , fishy taste			0
' the accomplishment is recognized by the @entity43 as the largest mako catch ever , he said			0
the mako shark is the fastest of all sharks and can swim at 60 miles per hour and this was no ordinary mako			0
' when i saw it , i knew it was a big fish			0
i 've been fishing since i was a little kid , but i thought it was maybe 700 pounds or so , then when we weighed it , it came in at 805 ! it was amazing , ' said @entity8			1
the 11 - pound mako was so big it did n't even fit in the back of his truck apparently catching huge fish runs in the family as the the former record belongs to @entity8 's cousin @entity63 who caught a 674 pound mako in 2009			1
@entity8 caught the mako off the @entity66 with the help of two cousins , @entity63 being one of them			1
the fish was so big that it would n't even fit into the back of @entity71 's truck			2
this is not the largest catch for @entity8 who caught a 949 pound tiger shark in 2010			1
sfgate reports that @entity8 is a third generation shark fisherman who takes his daughters aged 7 and 9 out fishing			2
he has a baby son who is only 3 weeks old and he plans on teaching him to be a fisherman as well			0
' the funny thing is , as i left the house to go out that night , i kissed my son and said ' @entity86 's gon na catch up a big , big fish tonight , ' but i did n't think it would be this big , ' @entity8 said			1
usually when @entity8 and his family catch a shark , they release it back into the wild			2
because this shark was so large , the family cooked it up and fed over 200 members of the community			2
@entity8 says he will not reveal the exact location of where he caught the shark for fear that tourists and foshing crews will overwhelm the area			1
when asked why he loves to fish @entity8 said , ' i do it because i saw my grandfather do it , my father , then my older brothers , then me			2
i love the sheer power of these fish , to be locked in hand - to - hand combat with a fish that can bite me			0

@entity8 's cousin @entity63 broke the last record for land based shark fishing when he caught a mako that weighed *670* pounds in *209*
@entity8 celebrated his catch by cooking the fish and feeding 200 community members
@entity8 usually throws fish back after catching them but was unable to revive this mako
' that 's why we decided to keep him . we do n't do it for the money , for the publicity , just to catch the fish , ' @entity8 said
the location of the catch is a *secret* so as not to overwhelm the area with other fishermen or tourists
