a camper impressing his friends camping in @entity3 with some mean licks on his guitar attracted a nasty admirer earlier this month - a rabid bat			2
@entity9 , from @entity3 was jamming away when the bat swooped down from the sky and landed on the startled guitar players neck			1
expecting the bat to fly off once it had realized where it has landed , @entity9 was obviously shocked to get a nip on the neck from the blood - thirsty creature			1
scroll down for @entity17 swooped : the bat can be seen on @entity9 's neck - having flown around the three men who were relaxing while camping luckily for @entity9 , a quick thinking friend fired a bb gun at the bat and killed it , enabling them to take it along with their friend to hospital for testing			1
once there they discovered that the bat had the fatal condition rabies , which animals pass on through their saliva and blood			2
@entity9 was started on an immediate regime of drugs to battle the effects of rabies , which have left him tired and exhausted			1
' this thing came out of nowhere , ' said @entity9 to @entity39			1
' i was thinking it was a good day until then			0
' get off ! the bat crawls up @entity9 's neck and bites him with its rabies infected teeth where is it ? the bat flies bites the guitar player - before they track it before shooting it dead with a bb gun ' something hit me			1
i was concentrating on staying in time and all that , and it hit me here , and i kind of saw something out of my peripheral vision			0
and then it 's there , and then it just bit me			0
' the first that @entity9 knew was when he saw the bat land on his neck			1
' it was like a cold dog nose , ' said @entity9			2
' it was a cold bat nose , mouth , whatever			0
i was n't injected with anything			0
it was just a cold bite			0
' the bat tried to swoop down for two more passes before it was shot dead			0
' whether we would get in trouble for shooting it , and i said well , it drew first blood			0
we need to take care of this thing , ' @entity9 said .			2

@entity9 was bitten by the animal carrying the deadly *disease*
