miss @entity28 said : ‘ we take very seriously someone who is concerned we would waste taxpayers ’ money , we really consider what we spend our money on			2
‘ i have felt on reflection it has been a really good use of time and resources , but obviously we always need to look at it and reflect whether it has been a good use of money and whether we should do it again			0
’ miss @entity28 said it would have taken the staff ‘ two months of normal meetings to get through the amount of work ’ they completed at the hotel , because it allowed them to work ‘ rapidly and intensively ’			0
