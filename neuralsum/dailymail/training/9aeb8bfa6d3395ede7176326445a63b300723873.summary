@entity8 , 47 , is accused of killing @entity13 , 17 , he has pleaded not guilty but prosecutors showed the jury his suv with nine bullet holes - his girlfriend previously testified he turned to her and said ' i hate that thug music ' before she heard gun shots			1
@entity22 told the court they had both been drinking before went inside a gas station for wine and potato chips and @entity8 shot the suv up - he claims the shooting was in self - defense			1
@entity8 has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder and three counts of attempted first - degree murder for the other passengers in the car			1
the man 's defense attorney @entity55 says he was only trying to defend himself , after seeing @entity13 grab what looked to be either a shotgun or a lead pipe			1
but prosecutors say the four men in the vehicle were n't armed , and while they did disrespect him , they never threatened the man			2
assistant state attorney @entity65 says the four men were out for a day of ' mall hopping and girl shopping ' when they decided to stop at the gas station to get gum and cigarettes			0
before coming over to tell the men to turn down their music , @entity8 town his girlfriend ' i hate that thug music ' as she walked over to the convenience store			1
like this : @entity80 , a witness for the prosecution , shows how he saw @entity8 shoot that day			1
@entity80 is currently in prison and tried to leverage for a lighter sentence in exchange for testifying @entity8 then went over and ' politely ' asked the men to turn their music down - which was so loud it was rattling the windows			1
@entity13 responded rudely telling one of his friends ' f * * * that n * * * * * ' and to turn the music back up			2
@entity65 says both @entity8 and @entity13 exchanged the f - word in the ensuing argument , but that @entity13 never threatened the older man			1
however , defense attorneys say @entity8 never cursed at @entity13 and that @entity13 got much more explicit in their fight			1
according to @entity8 , @entity13 threatened : ' i 'm going to f * * * * * g kill you			1
you 're dead , b * * * h. this is going down now			0
' aftermath : instead of turning himself in , @entity8 and his girlfriend drove 40 miles south to a bed and breakfast and ordered pizza			2
above , the couple 's @entity111 they also say @entity13 reached for a weapon , which @entity8 believed to be either a gun or a lead pipe , and seemed to be getting out of the car , prompting @entity8 to take out his 9mm pistol and shoot three times at @entity13 ' door			1
@entity8 shot each of @entity123 's legs and the third bullet tore through the teen 's liver , lungs and aorta			1
@entity22 said she heard a ' pop , pop , pop ' while she was inside and that @entity8 told her to get in the car when she came out - he then calmly walked over and put a gun in the car 's glovebox			1
@entity8 claims to have owned the gun for years but never used it before that occasion			2
but prosecutors say @entity13 could n't have gotten out of the car since the child locks were on			0
the defense pointed out that friend @entity140 , who was in the car at the time , initially told police that @entity13 was getting out of the car , but changed his story four days later			1
despite the driver of the suv backing up to drive away , prosecutors say @entity8 continued to barrage the car with gunfire			0
another point of contention is what happened immediately after the shooting and whether or not the four teens had time to hide the weapon @entity8 claims to have seen			1
prosecutors say the teens had no time to hide a weapon since they never left the parking lot			0
a police search of their vehicle only turned up a basketball , basketball shoes , some clothing and cups on the floor but ' no weapons '			0
murder : protesters gathered outside the court to express their support for the prosecution the defense on the other hand says the boys drove off to an adjacent parking lot first before returning to the gas station to call 911			2
police did n't search the area around the gas station until several days later , giving the men ' ample time to get rid of a firearm or pipe '			2
@entity55 points out that two witnesses initially reported that the teens seemed to be stashing something , and that two of the passengers in the suv were unaccounted for a period after the shooting			0
as for @entity8 , when his girlfriend @entity13 heard the shots , she left her food and change at the counter and ran out to their car			1
instead of turning himself in , the couple drove 40 miles south to @entity198 where they had a reservation at a bed and breakfast			0
the two ordered pizza , took the dog for a walk and @entity8 ' poured a big , tall drink - rum and @entity209			2
' they had cell phones , but they did n't call 911			0
he did n't drive to a police substation , ' @entity65 said			0
' that defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep			0
' hiding out ? @entity8 told interrogators the day after the shooting that he did n't turn himself in because he wanted to get things settled at home first the next day they saw a news report on tv about a 17 - year - old who had been fatally shot at a gas station in @entity225 , and instead of calling police then , they drove 130 miles home to satellite where police caught up with him the defense attorney blames most of that strange behavior on @entity8 's girlfriend , who ordered the pizza because she had n't had much to eat all day and was hungry			1
they decided to go home the next day instead of turn @entity8 in because @entity22 was ' petrified ' and ' did n't know the law of self - defense '			1
a day after the shooting , @entity8 told interrogators he ' was waiting till we get around people we know ' to turn himself in			2
he wanted to make sure his dog and ' everybody were where they needed to be			0
i did not want to being a s * * * storm down on them in @entity225 '			0
the prosecution may have a problem in their case when it comes to witnesses			0
the witness who took down @entity8 's license plate is currently in prison and tried to leverage a lighter sentence for agreeing to testify			0
and the teen driver of the suv was on probation and violating curfew when the incident happened			0
in the end , the defense painted @entity8 as a man who could have been a victim if he had n't taken out his gun that day			2
' @entity267 did n't make all men equal			0
@entity269 is a firearm , ' @entity55 said			0
' ( @entity8 ) had every right under the law to not be a victim , to be judged by 12 rather than carried by six			0
