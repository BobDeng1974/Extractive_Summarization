any @entity1 fans worth his blue and green was hit hard by @entity7 's spectacular @entity6 loss on sunday , but one superfan hit back by smashing his big screen tv			2
video has emerged of a man so overtaken by rage following coach @entity14 's already infamous call in the final moments of the game that he bum - rushes his own television set			1
' you do not throw a pass at the goal line when you have @entity21 , ' the irate fan grumbles -- referring to @entity7 's running back -- before breaking into a run of his own			0
' you do not throw a pass at the goal line when you have @entity21 ! ' : this @entity7 superfan was so enraged by the @entity29 - losing final play that he broke into a run toward his tv flying leap : friends stood by as the infuriated fan made a flying leap toward his television the man 's friends look on as his head then goes through the projection - style set 's giant technicolor screen , which somehow stays illuminated as it caves totally in			1
still not satisfied , the man bounces back and lands a few punches onto the screen			2
no one in the dimly lit room comes to the angry man 's side , preferring instead to let the spectacle unfold			0
when the punches fail to calm his furor , the man goes all in : he tips over the tv , letting it smash to the carpeted floor with a thud			0
pictured : the exact moment the old style plastic projection screen begins to bend around the man 's head bystanders : no one in the dimly lit room comes to the angry man 's side , preferring instead to let the spectacle unfold while the television was undoubtedly destroyed , some viewers have questioned whether the man vs. tv mashup was also a setup			1
' obviously fake , but still absolutely hilarious ! ' wrote @entity72 user @entity70			0
@entity72 user @entity73 agreed : ' even though this is fake it was the reaction of millions ! ! ! even @entity78 fans was like @entity79 ! ! who call pass at the goal line on 2nd down with one time out left ! ! ' he said			0
built them better then : even after the man 's bum - rush , the television remained illuminated ... and the man remained infuriated sealed its fate : in a final vengeful act , the man tips his tv over to the carpet floor with a thud vanquished : with the television gone , the man will no longer have to be reminded of sunday 's spectacular loss , save for his newfound internet stardom and the years of debate over coach @entity14 's last second play			1

the game losing final call by coach @entity14 left the superfan too overcome by rage to let the big screen television live
however , some viewers question whether the recorded man vs. tv mash - up was also a setup
