it was early one morning in september 2010 when a handyman came round to ms @entity3 's house			1
she knew him from previous jobs in the past , but @entity14 claimed he wanted to show her a couple of things that needed finishing in the basement			1
she had trauma to her brain and lacerations to her throat ' i 'm kind of talking and i remember distinctively him not saying anything at all , ' she said			0
' we get to the bottom of the stairs , he grabs my throat and i 'm just very taken , and i 'm trying to look around and i ca n't turn , i ca n't look			2
' @entity14 tried to strangle her			1
in jail : @entity14 is serving 28 years in prison ' i kept saying , ' what are you doing ? what are you doing ? ' and it came to a point where my voice just faded and i felt myself dropping and passed out , ' ms @entity3 said to @entity51			1
police were called after she failed to show up for work			0
she was alive , but barely			0
@entity14 had stabbed her in the neck			1
for a time it was not clear if she would live or die			0
@entity56 kept a constant vigil at her hospital bedside			0
it was another 12 days before she was able to full wake up and inform police who had committed the brutal assault			2
years on , ms. @entity3 is still feeling the affects of that fateful morning and still hears an echo in her ear when she speaks			1
' my ear feels very full			0
the side of my face feels like a mannequin , it 's kind of numb and tingly all the way down the left side , ' she said			0
