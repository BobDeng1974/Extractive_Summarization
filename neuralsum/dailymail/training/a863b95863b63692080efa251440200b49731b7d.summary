for many couples languishing in a moribund long - term relationship , the idea of a few tense hours on a claustrophobic road trip might prove the final straw			1
yet @entity5 , 56 , and @entity6 , 54 , put their 12 - year union on the line by popping out for a drive that spanned five years , 136,000 miles and 66 countries			1
and the couple say the adventure brought them closer together despite brushes with malaria , snakebites , gun - toting officials , and the biggest threat to their trip – @entity6 's inability to put the lid back on the toothpaste			1
feeling festive : @entity5 , 56 , and @entity6 , 54 , celebrated @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 @entity5 said : ' most people assume we must have been a really close couple to start this journey but that 's wrong			1
i suspect we may have separated had it not been for the trip			2
' the pressures of work were becoming harder , we spent little time together and we did n't even have that much in common			0
but now we know what we have in common and that is travelling			0
' the @entity42 couple first came up with the idea in 2008 after becoming bored with their 9 - to - 5 lives			2
@entity6 , then a legal rep , and @entity5 , a former call centre worker , spent a year planning the trip , buying a @entity49 , which they christened @entity51 in honour of @entity53			1
they left @entity55 on august 16 , 2009 , with a tent , a small fridge and a £ 50 - a - day budget – and have only just returned			1
seeing the sights : visiting one of the many temples at @entity63 complex in @entity64 , @entity65 setting up camp : the couple passed through the @entity68 in @entity69 during their five - year trip after driving down through @entity73 , the couple travelled around the edge of @entity75 , where they encountered one pistol - toting border guard who demanded £ 125			1
they haggled and he settled for £ 1.30 and a can of beer			2
@entity5 said : ' i fell ill in the @entity84			1
@entity6 had a book called when there is no doctor and he realised that i had malaria			1
we had been taking anti-malaria pills but for three days i was delirious			0
' but the biggest threat to their trip came from a more domestic source			0
@entity5 said : ' @entity6 kept leaving the toothpaste lid off and it was making a mess			1
when you are living out of the back of car everything becomes magnified and it can drive you insane			0
we had a huge barney which ended up with us vowing to end it all and ship @entity51 home as we could n't bear to sit next to each other for another minute			2
we wanted to talk to someone about the row but only had each other			0
' ends of the earth : crossing through the @entity112 in @entity113 in their @entity49 , which they christened @entity51 relations were eventually fixed and they moved on , through @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and on to @entity69 where @entity5 had another misfortune : ' in the bush and felt a knock on my foot – and saw a snake			1
an hour later my foot started to swell and i saw fang marks			0
i panicked , but as i felt fine i concluded it must have been non-venomous			0
' when i told locals they said it was a deadly @entity132 snake , and it must have just attacked something else , so when it bit me there was no venom left – a lucky escape			0
' the couple crossed to @entity140 then made their way up to @entity140 , @entity113 and @entity143 before their return			0
@entity5 said : ' we 've had the most incredible adventure , terrifying at times , but amazing			2
we are just ordinary people who gave up jobs , houses and nice lives to live 2ft away from each other 24 hours a day			0
' i think most would see that as a nightmare rather than a dream and it did feel like that to start with but we had told everyone we were going around the world , so it would have been embarrassing to come home			0
' and the trip has not satisfied their wanderlust – in the new year they plan to hit the road again , heading for @entity166 and @entity167			2
they travelled 136,000 miles through 66 countries on a £ 50 - per - day budget and have only recently returned rugged : tackling a flimsy bridge in @entity173 , the trip has not satisfied their wanderlust and they are planning to hit the road again in the @entity177			1
