@entity0 have hit back at @entity2 ’s accusation they are delaying their appointment of a new head coach in order to avoid signing any new players in january			1
the former @entity8 captain tweeted : ‘ brilliant tactics from @entity0 board to delay appointing their new manager so they do n’t have to buy any players in the transfer window			1
’ the @entity16 are still searching for @entity18 ’s successor and it is likely that @entity20 will remain in caretaker charge until the summer			2
caretaker manager @entity20 shows he has passion and desire to be @entity0 boss @entity25 's @entity2 tweeted suggesting @entity0 were deliberately delaying appointing a new boss but @entity0 managing director @entity27 ( left ) , with @entity28 , has denied the accusations but managing director @entity27 said : ‘ i saw the stuff @entity2 tweeted saying we ’re hanging back from appointing a head coach so we do n’t have to sign anyone which is n’t correct			1
are we delaying to get through the january window ? absolutely not			0
‘ in all honesty , the january window is not one we ever envisaged being particularly active in			2
that ’s partly because of the amount of business we did in the summer but also because january is a difficult market to operate in			0
’ @entity27 , meanwhile , has given the clearest indication yet that @entity0 will not appoint a new boss until the end of the season			1
@entity46 ( left ) is left a mere spectator as @entity49 's fizzing shot goes underneath him in the @entity0 goal @entity49 ( left ) scored the winning goal for @entity52 in the second half with a deflected effort ‘ we see this as a long - term decision , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’ve got a number of options and clearly my preference is to try and find someone to bring in now			0
‘ however , because it will be a long - term commitment , if i have to wait until the summer for what i believe is the right individual then i would rather wait than actually take someone now who i think is n’t the best fit			1
‘ i ’m not going to take someone who is free and available now if we have a better option and options by waiting until the end of the season			2
i know that wo n’t be an entirely popular point of view but for me that is the most sensible thing to do			0
it is about the medium to long term and ensuring we get the “ right one ”			0
