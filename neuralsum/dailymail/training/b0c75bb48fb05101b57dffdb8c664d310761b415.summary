by @entity0 the remains of one of the oldest homes in @entity4 , built more than 10,000 years ago , have been unearthed near @entity5			2
the dwelling was found in the path of the new forth bridge and has been dated to around 8240 bc. a large oval pit measuring nearly seven metres and studded with post holes was all that remained standing of the home from the @entity14 period			1
remains of several fireplace hearths were discovered at the site			1
this illustration shows how it may have looked like the holes would have held wooden posts supporting the walls and roof , which experts believe would have been covered with turf			2
remains of several fireplace hearts were also discovered			2
the ancient people who lived in the area were hunter gatherers and charred bone fragments on the site suggest they ate birds , fish , wild boar and possible deer			1
large quantities of charred hazelnut shells were also found			2
the residents were among the first settlers in @entity39 after the last glacial period ( a time within an ice age marked by colder temperatures )			1
archaeologists also recovered more than 1,000 flint artefacts including stone tools that would have been used for tasks including hunting , skinning and food processing			0
@entity50 , project manager for @entity51 , the company that carried out the works , said : ' the discovery of this previously unknown , and rare type of site has provided us with a unique opportunity to further develop our understanding of how early prehistoric people lived along the @entity60			1
' specialist analysis of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence recovered in the field is ongoing			0
this will allow us to put the pieces together and build a detailed picture of @entity14 lifestyle			0
' an archaeologist at the dig site stone tool fragments were found at the site the archaeology team also found the toe bones - most likely from a wolf - within the house			1
it 's not known if this came from a wolf pelt that would have been worn or used to line the floor for warmth			0
the @entity14 people were hunter gatherers , anatomically indistinguishable from modern humans , who would have subsisted on a diet of wild foodstuffs			0
they were among the first settlers in @entity39 after the last glacial period ( a time within an ice age marked by colder temperatures )			1
archaeologists have evidence from the forth bridge site that they may have eaten birds , fish , wild boar and possibly red or roe deer			2
as well as for their meat animals would also been hunted for their hides , sinew , bones , fat and other by - products			0
it is not possible to say if the house was a community hub but there was definitely no cattle or other domesticated animal present			0
animal domestication does not begin until the @entity108 , over 4,000 years after the date of the @entity110			0
the team believe the house was a semi-permanent structure not occupied all year round , but possibly for seasonal use in this case over the colder winter months			0
it would most likely have belonged to a family grouping , probably including extended members			0
they said they were n't surprised to find no evidence of domesticated animals , as this did not begin until the @entity108 period , over 4,000 years after the date of the house			0
@entity127 , @entity128 , said : ' this discovery and , especially , the information from the laboratory analyses adds valuable information to our understanding of a small but growing list of buildings erected by @entity39 â€™s first settlers after the last glaciation , 10,000 year ago			1
' the radiocarbon dates that have been taken from this site show it to be the oldest of its type found in @entity39 which adds to its significance			1
' transport minister @entity146 said : ' this ancient dwelling , which was unearthed as part of the routine investigations undertaken prior to construction works , is an important and exciting discovery			1
' we now have vital records of the findings which we will be able to share to help inform our understanding of a period in @entity39 's ancient history			1
' all of the artefacts will be preserved .			0
