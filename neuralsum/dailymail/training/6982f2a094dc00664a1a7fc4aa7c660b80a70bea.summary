a mother died after eating soup she made using one of the world ’s deadliest mushrooms which she had unwittingly picked in her garden			1
@entity7 gardener @entity6 found the death cap mushrooms beneath some mature oak and fir trees and mistook them for an edible type			1
in fact the fungus – amanita phalloides – contains one of the most lethal of all toxins and is the most common cause of death in humans from mushroom poisoning			1
just half a cap is enough to kill			0
@entity6 , 57 , accidentally picked death cap mushrooms ( left , file photo ) when foraging for fresh mushrooms to add to a tin of @entity27 's @entity26 she was preparing for dinner mrs @entity6 , 57 , added the ones she had picked to a tin of @entity27 ’s @entity26 which she heated and ate with her husband @entity32 , an inquest heard yesterday			1
shortly afterwards they became ill with vomiting and diarrhoea			0
a doctor who visited their home in @entity39 , @entity40 , the next day thought mrs @entity6 had the norovirus , and decided against sending her to hospital for fear of infecting other patients			1
but the following day the couple , who had four children between them , were taken to hospital where mrs @entity6 was put into intensive care			1
she died the next day after suffering multiple organ failure			0
the death cap is the most dangerous mushroom , responsible for 95 per cent of all deaths from mushroom poisoning worldwide			1
the deaths of roman emperor @entity57 in @entity58 and holy roman emperor @entity59 in 1740 are said to have been caused by eating death caps			2
patients die from organ failure within a few days unless they have a kidney and liver transplant			0
death caps are common across @entity66 and contain about 20 different poisons			2
the strength of the main poison , alpha - @entity70 , is not reduced by freezing or cooking			2
mr @entity73 , a 49 - year - old property developer who had eaten less of the soup , survived			1
he told the inquest in @entity76 : ‘ we had picked mushrooms before from the garden and put them into mushroom soup			1
she had n’t done it on her own before			0
' i had a bowl of soup that she had given me and then had stew			2
the wife did n’t like it because it had butter beans in it so she had more soup			2
she made the soup her main meal			0
’ doctors say that even if mrs @entity6 had been taken to hospital within hours of consuming the mushrooms last november , she had eaten so many it is unlikely she would have survived			1
she died at the @entity99 in @entity76			0
@entity40 coroner @entity100 , who recorded a verdict of misadventure , said : ‘ one should never pick mushrooms , particularly under trees , unless you know exactly what you are picking			1
' the problem with this mushroom is that if you do taste it , it does not taste unpleasant			0
’ the death cap appears most commonly under oaks			0
it grows to between three and six inches high			0
poisoning symptoms , including stomach pain , vomiting and diarrhoea , tend to appear ten to 16 hours after consumption , and can then ease			0
but the toxins continue to attack the body and death typically occurs six to 16 days after consumption from liver or kidney failure .			0
