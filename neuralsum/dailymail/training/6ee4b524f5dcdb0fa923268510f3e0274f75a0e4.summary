the @entity0 last summer should have been a period of down time for the @entity4 boss , and in some ways it was — but it was also an opportunity for reflection			1
@entity9 had been in charge of the top flight for 15 years as @entity14 football ’s most enduring senior administrator			1
but now there was a possibility his time was up			2
first , there was the sexist emails affair , in which he forwarded messages he acknowledges were inappropriate , containing jokes derogatory to women			2
he apologised at the time for the nature of those emails and will not discuss the issue in depth now			2
@entity29 's defeat by @entity30 at @entity31 in 2007 prompted the @entity32 the scandal prompted his first period of reflection and he was able to carry on in his job because there was never any desire among his paymasters , the @entity4 clubs , for his removal			1
‘ of course i was extremely encouraged by the support i received through what was a challenging summer , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ that was from , firstly , colleagues and clubs			2
ultimately there was a wider group of interested people			2
‘ what matters is the 20 clubs and the 100 people who work at the @entity4			1
’ but , as he indicates , there was another reason to question his future			0
shortly after the email furore sprung up , he was at the @entity59 for heart surgery			0
this was routine and planned but still carried significant risks			0
@entity9 and @entity63 of @entity64 at the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 ‘ i was n’t scared because the @entity59 has fantastic people , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ but does it give you time to reflect ? yeah			0
you do n’t know whether you are going to come out of it and you do n’t know whether you ’ll have that energy you had before			0
‘ in fairness to the clubs , i said , “ i ’ll go away , i ’ll take stock and let ’s see how i feel when i get back ”			2
i was back doing bits within a couple of weeks			0
‘ probably after two months , by the time i did the season launch , i pretty much knew i was going to be ok			0
’ @entity83 have stuttered in the @entity4 under @entity84 @entity9 shows no sign of slowing down			1
the day we meet , he is on his way to @entity66 in @entity67 , where the @entity4 under 12 teams are on an extended weekend , which includes an inter-club qualifying tournament as well as an educational trip to the @entity92 battlefields and memorials			1
the @entity4 ’s @entity95 tournament has become so established that the league has funded an artificial pitch in nearby @entity98 , where the games are played			1
the facility was opened by @entity9 last week			1
problems keep arising , too			0
last year he appeared to be at loggerheads with @entity104 chairman @entity103 , declining to serve on his @entity105 to improve the @entity29 team			1
now the mood seems more conciliatory			0
@entity108 and @entity109 joining the @entity4 ' is definitely not on the agenda ' , says @entity9 ‘ when you step back , what does @entity103 want to achieve ? ’ said @entity9			1
‘ he wants to achieve more and better homegrown players			2
well , the reality is , if you look at the @entity32 ( @entity32 , the @entity4 youth strategy established in 2011 ) , that ’s the opening line , the opening objective : more and better homegrown players , who are able to hold their own in @entity4 first teams and qualify to play for @entity29			1
‘ the only thing that really got tetchy was the tactics			0
of a big , grand opening statement			0
our view was that he ( @entity103 ) had n’t gone and looked under the lid to see what was there already			0
‘ you ca n’t argue with what he ’s trying to achieve and that ’s why it feels different a year on			0
’ however , the @entity4 is still seen by many as the principal stumbling block for the @entity29 team			1
the accusation is that while @entity9 is busy banking ever more extraordinary tv deals , @entity29 can rot			1
@entity9 takes on the point with passion			1
‘ you can plot the traces of the @entity32			0
i can date it : november 21 , 2007 , @entity29 v @entity30 , 2 - 3 , in the rain			1
i was there with a number of people			0
that ’s when we went away and recruited @entity150 ( who oversees the @entity32 and youth academies ) and said , “ we ’ve got to do something to get the thing back up ”			0
@entity9 defends foreign owners like @entity155 at @entity156 ‘ we care as passionately as anybody about @entity29 winning			1
you sit and watch these tournaments and wish we could do better but there is a limit to what we can realistically do			0
‘ players have to be developed at clubs — they are the hub of development			2
in the early days it ’s schools , which is why we ’re heavily investing in school sport			0
we want to build that because we do want a better @entity29 team			1
’ @entity9 is @entity14 and knows how to tiptoe through the topic			1
what do owners such as @entity155 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 think about the issue ? @entity178 fans protest with banners about the rising cost of tickets for @entity4 matches ‘ you said “ foreign owners ” but it ’s nothing to do with foreign owners this issue			1
clubs ’ owners first and foremost want their clubs to win			2
but there are an awful lot of owners who understand that a successful @entity29 team would make the glow in which the @entity4 is seen a more positive one			1
’ ticket prices is the issue almost every @entity14 football fan would want to raise with @entity9			1
he expresses his frustration that most surveys quote top - end prices when the @entity4 deliberately encourages clubs to charge expensive executive prices so they can make more , cheaper tickets available			1
‘ it ’s like going on to the @entity207 website and just asking for the first - class single airfare , ’ he said			0
the rise of @entity210 and @entity211 this season helps sell the @entity4 around the world ‘ it is undoubtedly true and i can not deny that since the @entity4 was formed , the overall dynamic for the attending fan has altered			1
what is absolutely true is that season on season we have lost what some might describe as some of our core , traditional fans			0
‘ but what is also undeniably true is that we ’ve picked up far more			0
is it a real topic ? yes , it is			0
are the clubs listening ? yes , they are			2
are they doing everything that the fans would want them to do ? of course , they ’re not			0
’ @entity109 and @entity108 joining the @entity4 is definitely not on the agenda — ‘ i can see what ’s in it for them ; i ca n’t see what ’s in it for us ’ — and nor , he says , is the 39th game or an international round of @entity4 games			1
‘ there ’s no economic imperative to play games abroad but there is a marketing ( argument ) , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not here saying the person who ’s had a season ticket for the last 30 years is n’t more important than our fan base in @entity249 or @entity250			2
but you ca n’t ignore them			0
’ intriguingly , @entity9 bangs the drum for globalisation by invoking @entity255			1
he links the rise of @entity211 , @entity257 and @entity210 this season to growing international revenues , which are distributed equally , as opposed to the domestic tv deal , which is weighted towards the big clubs			2
@entity211 qualfying for the @entity263 would help boost the @entity4 though he remains doggedly impartial , he gives the impression he would view as it as a success for the @entity4 model should @entity211 qualify for the @entity263			1
‘ when the season ends , whoever has won it , and people say what do you want to happen next year , i just say , “ i want somebody else to win it ”			0
and that goes for @entity263 places as well			0
i ’d like to see a different four teams in the @entity263			0
‘ you have to be a little bit careful as you also want your best teams , your strongest teams , in the @entity263 , because you want us to do well			0
‘ but generally we want to change it up			0
we do n’t care who wins as long as it is n’t the same clubs every time			2
‘ i ’ve sat here for 10 years saying the more we develop internationally , the more revenues are distributed evenly			2
it is a far more communist / taxed system , where the big clubs are being taxed internationally to pay for the smaller clubs			2
the advantage is the gap narrows			0
therefore , you do get more chance for a small club , a middle club , to beat the top clubs			1
’ @entity9 appears to be ready for a new phase			1
in time , the ‘ challenging summer ’ may prove a footnote @entity4 under 12 teams take part in an annual tournament in @entity66 in @entity67			2

more homegrown stars , different clubs in top four and cheaper tickets

he says a successful @entity29 team would boost the @entity4
