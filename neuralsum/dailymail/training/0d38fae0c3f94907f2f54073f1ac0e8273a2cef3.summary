by @entity0 @entity1 has performed a complete u-turn on the legislation regarding infant vaccinations , saying now that children young enough will be covered by the meningitis b vaccine babies could receive the new meningitis b vaccine as soon as this summer and it could also be extended to teenagers			1
in a @entity11 , infants aged two months will be vaccinated on the @entity12 if costs with the manufacturer can be agreed			1
and research will be carried out which could lead to teenagers also receiving the vaccine			2
@entity19 has one of the highest meningitis b rates in the world – affecting on average 1,870 people each year			1
the disease can kill within hours			0
children under five and teenagers are most at risk			0
it kills more under - fives than any other infectious disease in the @entity19			2
the @entity32 ’s u-turn on providing the vaccine on the @entity12 comes in the wake of intense pressure from charities and senior doctors on the @entity38			1
the vaccine , known as @entity39 and made by @entity40 , is the first to protect against the leading cause of life - threatening bacterial meningitis			2
but last july , the committee said it was not cost - effective ‘ at any price ’ and could not be recommended for use on the @entity12			2
thousands of campaigners petitioned the prime minister and health secretary @entity1 urging them to ensure it was approved			0
in october , the committee said it was considering new evidence and a range of views			0
the vaccine was licensed for use in january last year and the committee figures suggest that since then , at least 200 people in @entity19 were killed by meningitis b or suffered serious after - effects			1
professor @entity60 , deputy chief medical officer at the @entity32 , said : ‘ infants under one year of age are most at risk of meningitis b and the number of cases peak at around five or six months of age			1
since the meningitis b vaccine was created last year at least 200 people in @entity19 were killed by meningitis b or suffered serious after - effects ‘ with early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment , most make a full recovery			1
‘ but it is fatal in about one in ten cases and can lead to long - term health problems such as amputation , deafness , epilepsy and learning difficulties			0
‘ we will now be working closely with @entity40 in the coming months and , if negotiations are successful , we hope to work with the other @entity19 health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis b as quickly as possible			1
‘ this would make the @entity19 the first country in the world to implement a nationwide vaccination programme			2
’ @entity89 , division head at @entity90 , said the company will work with the @entity32 to get the vaccine to babies as early as this summer			0
‘ at @entity40 , it took us more than 20 years of hard work to get to this point , ’ he said			0
the joint committee has recommended infants are immunised from two months of age – having three jabs in total – and that there is a one - off catch - up programme for babies aged three and four months when it is introduced			1
the committee has also recommended a pilot programme vaccinating teenagers to see whether it reduces the level of bacteria carried in the nose , which can trigger meningitis in this age group			0
campaigners claim that , in extreme cases , the cost of treating and supporting each survivor of meningitis is £ 3million			0
statistics show that between 2008 and 2012 , £ 28million was paid in compensation to the families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis which @entity122 had not spotted .			0
