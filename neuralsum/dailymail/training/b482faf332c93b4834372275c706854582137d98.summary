embattled former @entity1 official @entity0 is on two different hot seats this week , as a pair of @entity5 - led congressional committees aim to prosecute her for her role in a scheme to target conservative groups in the middle of an election campaign season			1
the @entity11 will convene a hearing on thursday to consider a motion holding @entity0 in contempt of @entity15 , the first step toward a possible criminal prosecution			1
a contempt resolution , if the @entity11 should approve it , could also help persuade a federal court to compel @entity0 to testify about her role in what has become known as the tea party targeting scandal			1
@entity0 has pleaded the @entity25 twice in @entity11 hearings , refusing to answer questions			2
but committee @entity5 led a party - line effort to declare that she had waived that right in a 2013 hearing by offering a self - serving opening statement and claiming that she had done nothing wrong			1
@entity34 @entity35 : house speaker @entity36 recalled in an @entity38 interview on monday that he never cared about @entity0 's firing , but wants to know ' who 's going to jail ? ' cat , meet canary : @entity47 chairman @entity46 aims to hold @entity0 in contempt , a necessary step before the @entity45 can prosecute her or a federal judge can force her to testify in an open hearing @entity0 ( r ) was sworn in twice before the oversight committee but refused to answer questions despite offering a lengthy opening statement insisting she did nothing wrong house speaker @entity36 told a @entity38 audience on monday night that the full @entity15 ' will take up that contempt resolution			1
' ' if she 's not going to tell us the truth , we are going to hold her in contempt			0
' on wednesday the @entity61 will consider its own response to @entity0 's silence			1
members will ' mark up ' a letter directing attorney general @entity66 to prosecute her ' for violations of one or more criminal statutes based on evidence the @entity11 has uncovered in the course of the investigation of @entity1 abuses			1
' since the letter contains confidential tax information about the conservative groups the @entity1 targeted , the meeting will take place away from public view			1
the @entity79 prohibits the disclosure of that information			0
getting @entity66 to prosecute @entity0 could be a tough sell , since hse has already met in secret with @entity45 investigators			2
@entity11 @entity5 claim that in those meetings she addressed details of her work that she refused to talk about in open hearings			2
until her resignation in disgrace last year , @entity0 headed the @entity1 's @entity92 , an office tasked with vetting and monitoring nonprofit groups whose purpose entitles them to an exemption from paying federal income taxes			1
for more than three years , evidence shows , that office played political favorites by quickly approving politically liberal groups while it slow - walked applications form tea party groups and other conservative - minded organizations			2
@entity61 chairman @entity105 is retiring next year but wants to end his career by seeing @entity0 prosecuted ; his committee will hash out a letter on wednesday demanding attorney general @entity66 bring charges loyal opposition : liberal firebrand @entity111 , a @entity114 @entity113 congressman , has defended @entity0 by saying she has a right to keep the @entity11 in the dark oversight committee @entity113 , led by @entity114 rep. @entity117 , claim that some progressive groups ' approvals for special tax status were also delayed			1
but @entity121 rep. @entity46 , a @entity121 who chairs the committee , issued a scathing report this week disputing that claim			0
hundreds of right - wing groups were targeted , often with lengthy intrusive questionnaires that liberal organizations never saw			2
the @entity1 's demands included lists of donors and program participants , including minors ; information about prayers offered at meetings ; exhaustive lists of comments left on @entity140 posts ; and names of volunteers			2
@entity36 recalled monday night that when the scandal first broke , he told reporters that ' i do n't care who 's going to be fired ' over the @entity1 fiasco			0
' i want to know who 's going to jail			0
' ' somebody at the @entity1 violated the law			0
' ' we know that ms. @entity0 gave up her right to plead the @entity25 , ' he said			0
' she refused to testify – and she testified and spoke with the prosecutors of the @entity45			0
i do n't know why she would n’t talk to the @entity15 and to the @entity157 people			0
' @entity36 also hinted that officials other than @entity0 could face legal jeopardy			0
4 - 10 - 14 contempt @entity160 = " 168397004 " ; var docstoc_title = " 4 - 10 - 14 @entity161 " ; var docstoc_urltitle = " 4 - 10 - 14 @entity162 " ;			0

@entity11 will vote soon on a resolution holder @entity0 in contempt of @entity15 , *paving* the way for criminal charges
@entity61 meets wednesday to hash out a letter to the attorney general demanding prosecution
@entity0 , the @entity1 official at the center of a scheme to target conservative nonprofit groups , has refused to testify before @entity15 about her role
*republicans* on the oversight committee determined that she waived her fifth *amendment* rights by making a self - serving statement in a 2013 hearing
@entity0 could go to jail for *misleading* @entity15 and for abuse of power . even if *ag* @entity66 refuses to prosecute , a judge could force her to testify
