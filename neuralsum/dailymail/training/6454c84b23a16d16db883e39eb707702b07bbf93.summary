however , the 2011 crime received extensive media coverage thanks to the late journalist ’s name recognition and her younger husband ’s reputation for bizarre behaviour , which likely dealt a blow to the home ’s value			1

revamped : since @entity4 's gruesome murder , the home has since been fully remodeled the sun - drenched photos convey luxury and style , with two fireplaces and a bay window in the living room and hardwood floors running throughout the home			1
