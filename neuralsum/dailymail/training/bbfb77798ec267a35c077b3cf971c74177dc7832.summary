this @entity4 penguin went to investigate a camera left in the snow by a geologist on @entity8 , in @entity9			1
but the hungry bird was disappointed to discover it was n't edible when it opened its red beak wide			2
open wide : this @entity4 penguin went to investigate a camera left in the snow by a geologist on @entity8 , in @entity9 the geologist was on a tour of @entity9 with @entity18 which owns and operates the expedition vessel @entity20			1
the researcher left the camera near a penguin highway for a couple of hours which this clip is from			1
@entity8 is one of the largest @entity4 penguin colonies			1
a member of the expedition team posted the image on @entity31 and wrote : ' this gentoo # @entity33 just ate our @ @entity35			2
@entity9 ' looks like as good a place for a snooze : a @entity4 penguin relaxes in the snow in @entity40 , @entity9 gentoo penguins have flamboyant red - orange beaks , white - feather caps , and peach - colored feet and stand out against their drab , rock - strewn @entity46 habitat			1
these charismatic waddlers , who populate the @entity48 and numerous islands around the frozen continent , are the penguin world â€™s third largest members , reaching a height of 30in and a weight of 12lbs			1
@entity4 parents , which often form long - lasting bonds , are highly nurturing			1
at breeding time , both parents will work to build a circular nest of stones , grass , moss , and feathers			0
the mother then deposits two spherical , white eggs , which both parents take turns incubating for more than a month			0
members of the @entity20 said they enjoyed a beautiful night camping at @entity71 , in @entity9 hatchlings remain in the nest for up to a month , and the parents alternate foraging and brooding duties			1
like all penguins , gentoos are a bit awkward on land			0
but underwater they move gracefully			0
they have streamlined bodies and strong , paddle - shaped flippers that propel them up to 22 miles an hour , faster than any other diving bird			0
adults spend the entire day hunting , usually close to shore , but occasionally ranging as far as 16 miles ( 26 kilometers ) out			0
when pursuing prey , which includes fish , squid , and krill , they can remain below for up to seven minutes and dive as deep as 655ft			0
@entity4 numbers are increasing on the @entity48 but have plummeted in some of their island enclaves , possibly due to local pollution or disrupted fisheries			2
they are protected by the @entity100 of 1959 and received near threatened status on the @entity102 in 2007 .			0
