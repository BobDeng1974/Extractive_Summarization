a @entity7 coffee shop has laid out a set of rules for its diners that includes a ban on talking about ‘ hipster ’ things and who they had sex with last night , according to a local blogger 's photo that captured it outside			1
ironically @entity21 , which shows overturned buckets and crates for seating on weekends along its alleged problematic alleyway , is a hipster venue itself			0
@entity28 rules : a posting of rules by a @entity7 coffee shop has asked their outside diners to clean up after themselves , lower their voices and not talk about annoying hipster topics in contrast to their newly posted rules , their website sells their artisan atmosphere - featuring an assortment of coffees from @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 among others - as a place you will likely hear ' a dramatic recounting of last night 's scandalous activities			1
’ but they appear to have turned their ways , at least with the @entity53 alleyway ’s neighbours in mind			2
as the rules go : keep the alley clear of trash , bring dishes back inside , watch out for traffic in the alley , monitor your voice levels and lastly : ' [ do n't talk ] about annoying hipster topics , or who you f * * * * * last night			2
you should n't do that anyhow , but our neighbors actually can hear you			0
' the alley : the rules were posted for diners along this alleyway whose chit - chat is said to be heard by the area 's neighbours the scene : the front of @entity21 is seen with road bikes leaning out front and barristers inside offering an assortment of coffees from @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 fancy that : ironically @entity21 describes itself as a place for people to go to hear conversations on what ' scandalous activities ' one another got up to the night before the post signs off : ' mucho smoocho			1
' what could classify as ' hipster topics ' by @entity21 ’s standards is not clear from the posting			0
@entity93 suggests one topic being the customer having to tell the barista what kind of coffee they 'd like			2
@entity100 , who posted the photo to his blog this week notes that while the last rule ' may sound somewhat sarcastic ... most people do not live vicariously through overheard stories of love conquests occurring at @entity108 concerts			0
so perhaps there is a shred of truth to this			0
