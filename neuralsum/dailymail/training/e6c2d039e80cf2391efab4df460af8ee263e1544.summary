an airliner came within just 80ft of colliding with a quadcopter drone after it was ' deliberately flown ' at the passenger plane as it flew over @entity3 , an official report reveals			1
the 74 - seater aeroplane was travelling over @entity6 when the pilot spotted the remote - controlled quadcopter ' very close ' to the right wing - tip. an investigation launched into the incident recorded the risk of collision as ' high ' , in what is believed to be the first ever near - miss between a passenger plane and a drone in the @entity17			1
this diagram , which was provided for the @entity20 's investigation , shows the passenger plane ( @entity22 ) on its flight path ( blue line ) over @entity6 in @entity3 and the estimated closest point of approach ( @entity27 ) the @entity17 @entity20 report into the incident , which emerged this week , revealed how the @entity22 twin - engine turboprop airliner was travelling at 1,500ft as it came in to land at @entity31 when the pilot noticed the drone			1
the report revealed how the pilot informed the control tower at @entity31 over the sighting and told the operator how the object was ' too close ' to the plane			1
he told the tower that he thought he had seen a ' remote - control helicopter with a very small engine ' before confirming it was a black and red quadcopter			0
the tower responded by informing the pilot there had been ' a couple ' of quadcopters reported in the area at the time of the incident in may			0
the co-pilot told the @entity55 investigation that his impression was that the quadcopter had been flown deliberately close to the plane			1
the report revealed that it had not been possible to trace the drone nor its operators since the incident and concluded that it was disappointing that no one had come forward to take responsibility of the quadcopter			2
the co-pilot of the airliner told the @entity55 investigation how he believed the remote - controlled quadcopter drone had been flown at the plane ' deliberately ' during the incident in @entity6 , @entity3 ( file picture ) the following transcript , as revealed in the @entity55 report , reveals the conversation between the airliner 's pilot ( @entity22 ) and the control tower at @entity31 ( @entity77 ) during the incident			1
@entity22 : ' … for information when we were on the glide just about to intercept the glide er seen on the right side kind of er you know remote control helicopter er very small engine flying on the right side same altitude ' @entity77 : ' that 's understood roughly what range when you saw that was it ' @entity22 : ' just before we intercept the glide was black and red ' @entity77 : ' that 's understood er i 'll make a note of that ' @entity22 : ' was not sure it was you know a helicopter it looks like it 's a brand new thing that are flying around now on remote control ' @entity77 : ' oh a quadcopter type thing maybe ' @entity22 : ' say again sorry ' @entity77 : ' perhaps something like a quadcopter er we 've had a couple of those around here er been reported ' @entity22 : ' yes exactly that ' @entity77 : ' understood ' @entity77 : ' ( @entity22 ) c / s do you know roughly how far away the erm model was from you ' @entity22 : ' er from my point of view it was too close ' @entity77 : ' understood ' concluding its investigation , the @entity55 said : ' the board were content that the @entity22 pilot had clearly seen the quadcopter but , unfortunately , there was too little information available to make a meaningful analysis of the occurrence or to accurately assess the risk			2
' members were disappointed that someone would fly a quadcopter so high on the extended approach path to an airport , and that no had come forward to help with the analysis			0
' it was unanimously agreed by the @entity20 that the cause of the @entity20 was that the quadcopter was flown close enough to the @entity22 to cause its pilot concern ; because there was too little information to assess the degree of risk accurately , it was graded as @entity138 ' remote - controlled drones can be bought for as little as £ 225 in the @entity17 and security fears are increasing over the risk they pose to other aircraft			1
@entity17 pilots are demanding better protection for the public against the risks of drones and the airline pilots ' association @entity150 is set to call for tougher rules for the use of larger remote aircraft			0
@entity150 , which will give evidence before a @entity156 committee tomorrow , wants drones - officially known as @entity158 ( @entity158 ) - which share airspace with passenger and freight airliners , to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft			0
the near - miss occurred as the passenger plane came in to land at @entity31 in @entity3 ( pictured ) this includes only being flown by operators with pilot - equivalent training and being subject to tougher security measures at ground level			2
@entity150 believes a full public consultation must be carried out before the government sets rules on how larger commercial @entity158 , for example carrying cargo , will operate over villages , towns and cities in @entity17			0
general secretary @entity179 said : ' the @entity17 should become a ' safe drone zone ' so we can make the most of the major business and leisure opportunities offered by remotely piloted aircraft , while protecting passengers , pilots and residents			2
' the technology is developing quickly and we could see remote aircraft the same size as a @entity191 being operated commercially in our skies within 10 years			0
' large unmanned aircraft , when they come , should be as safe as manned aircraft and the @entity17 public should be fully consulted before companies fly large , remotely - piloted aircraft over their homes alongside passenger planes			0

plane came within 80ft of colliding with drone as it went to land at @entity6
pilot of 74 - seater airliner said quadcopter was ' very close ' to right wing - tip
co-pilot told investigation drone was deliberately flown at aircraft at 1,500ft
@entity17 @entity20 incident report concluded there was ' high risk of collision '
