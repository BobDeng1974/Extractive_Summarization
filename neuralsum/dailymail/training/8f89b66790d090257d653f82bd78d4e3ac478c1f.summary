@entity0 clashed with @entity1 during a heated discussion on @entity3 where the controversial tv host claimed being a member of the religion is like being in the @entity7			1
the oscar - winning director was also appalled when author and guest on the talk show @entity12 said the @entity14 faith was the ' motherload of bad ideas '			1
the trio , appearing on @entity18 's @entity17 with @entity1 on friday , collided while debating whether large numbers of the @entity14 population share the beliefs of jihadists			1
it led to the actor saying : ' it 's just an ugly thing to say			1
it 's gross , it 's racist			2
it 's like saying : " oh you shifty @entity31 "			2
they 'll criticize white theocracy , they 'll criticize @entity45			0
they still get agitated over the abortion clinic bombing that happened in 1984			0
' the crucial point of confusion is we have been sold this meme of @entity52 - where every criticism of the doctrine of @entity3 is conflated with bigatory towards @entity56 as people			1
@entity0 responds by saying : ' are you the person who understands the officially codified doctrine of @entity3			1
@entity12 then returns by saying ' i am actually well educated in this subject ' before @entity0 says : ' you are saying that @entity52 is not a real thing ? ' @entity1 then says : ' that 's not what we are saying ' before @entity12 adds : ' we have to be able to criticize bad ideas and @entity3 is the motherload of bad ideas			1
' the @entity72 star then sits back in his chair in shock and adds ' it 's an ugly thing to say			1
' @entity1 continues the conversation : ' lets get down to who has the right answer			0
a billion people you say , all these people do n't hold these pernicious beliefs			2
that 's just not true @entity0 , that 's just not true			2
' you say its down to these few bad apples , but the idea that someone should be killed if they leave the @entity3 religion is just a few bad apples ... ' @entity0 then says : ' the people who actually believe that you should murder someone if you dishonor the @entity3 faith is not with the majority of @entity56 at all			1
explaining the the proportions of followers who believe in certain ideals , @entity12 says : ' at the center of the circle you have jihadists who wake up ion the morning wanting to kill apostates , wanting to die trying , they believe in paradise , they believe in martyrdom			1
' outside of this you have @entity3			1
people who are just convinced of matryrdom and paradise and wanting to force their religion on the rest of humanity			1
' but they want to work with in the system and they are not willing to blow themselves up on a bus			0
they want to change governments , they want to use democracy against itself			0
' those two circles are arguably 20 per cent of the @entity14 world			0
based on a bunch of polls that we can talk about			0
' to give you one point of contact , 78 per cent of @entity56 said the @entity130 cartoonist ( who was accused of depicting the prophet @entity131 in an animation ) should have been prosecuted			0
' host @entity1 ( left ) said that following @entity3 was like being a member of the @entity7 while author @entity12 ( right ) claimed @entity52 was just a ' meme ' ' but outside of that we have conservative @entity56 who say that @entity136 does not represent us , that we are horrified by that			1
but they hold views about human rights and about women and about homosexuals are deeply troubling			0
' these are not @entity3 , these are not jihadists			1
they also keep women and homosexuals immiserated in those cultures			0
' and we have to empower the true @entity14 reformers in the world to change it			0
this behaviour is not going to do that			0
journalist @entity152 then cuts in , telling @entity1 he was painting an ' incomplete ' picture of the religion by failing to account reformers like activist @entity156			2
' or how about the more than a billion people who are n't fanatical , who do n't punish women , who just want to go to school , have some sandwiches , and do n't do any of the things you say all @entity56 do ? ' @entity0 adds			2
@entity1 responds to this by saying : ' one reason they ( other views ) do n't get exposed is because they are afraid to speak out			0
because it 's the only religion that acts like the @entity7			1
that will f * * * ing kill if you say the wrong thing , draw the wrong picture or write the wrong book			1
' seeking an explanation , @entity0 then asks the panelists : ' what is you answer ? is it just to condemn @entity3 ? we 've killed more muslims than they have killed us by an awful lot			2
' yet somehow we are exempt from these things			0
because they are not really a reflection of what we believe in			0
he then said sarcastically : ' it was by accident , that 's how we invaded @entity192			2
i am explicitly telling you that i disagree with what you think			0
but @entity1 disparagingly tells the actor : ' we are obviously not convincing anyone here			0

heated discussion took place on @entity18 's @entity201 on friday
