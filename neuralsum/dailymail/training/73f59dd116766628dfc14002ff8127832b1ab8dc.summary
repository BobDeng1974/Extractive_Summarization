clipping the eight barrier in the 110 metres hurdles proved the difference for @entity3 on tuesday night , as the 29 - year - old had to settle for @entity6 silver once again			1
frustration was etched over @entity3 ’s face as he watched a replay and realised just how close he had come to winning the @entity6 title : just four - hundredths of a second , squandered after he was knocked slightly off balance after hurdle eight			1
@entity16 ’s @entity15 , a much quicker sprinter over the flat , drove to gold to @entity3 ’s right in the final metres as the @entity19 finished second in 13.36secs			1
close : @entity3 on his way to winning silver in the men 's 110m hurdles @entity3 also won a silver behind @entity19 ’s @entity26 four years ago in @entity27 and , following the withdrawal of world @entity29 of @entity16 , this was the classically trained pianist ’s big chance to win a major title			1
speaking on the @entity35 , 400m world record - holder @entity34 said : ‘ it ’s a shame for @entity3			1
i think he knows he ’ll never be a world champion and that was probably his opportunity of a gold medal on the big stage			0
’ @entity40 , a bronze medallist in 2010 , finished last in the final and earlier on tuesday @entity26 experienced one of his most ‘ devastating days on the track ’ when he crashed out in qualifying			1
the defending champion , 33 , hit the first and second hurdles and failed to complete the race in what could well be his last season on the track			2
but where a silver for @entity3 will always prompt thoughts of what might have been , @entity19 ’s @entity51 was deservedly delighted by her second place in the triple jump			1
the 23 - year - old from @entity59 delivered the performance of her career so far , leaping 14.09metres — 34 centimetres beyond her 2012 personal best — in the second round to seal silver behind @entity65 from @entity16 , who jumped 14.21m			2
almost : @entity3 was unlucky not to be celebrating a gold medal win on tuesday night runner - up : @entity70 won silver for @entity19 in the men 's decathlon struggle : @entity26 ( right ) hits the hurdle as he competes in men 's 110m hurdles there was also a third silver medal for @entity19 at @entity80 on tuesday night , as @entity70 came second in the decathlon			1
the 23 - year - old was third going into the final event , the gruelling 1500m , but finished nine second ahead of @entity84 of @entity85 to take silver behind @entity87 of @entity88			1
it was a fitting comeback for the decathlete , who scored 8,109 points , after he was forced to pull out of last year ’s @entity93 in @entity94 with a hamstring tear			0
@entity96 , the only remaining @entity98 gold medallist competing for @entity19 at @entity80 , reached wednesday night 's long jump final with his first qualifying jump of 8.05m on tuesday morning , but admitted he was ‘ held together by tape ’			1
ambition : @entity96 will be looking for long jump gold on wednesday evening the 27 - year - old pulled out of two warm - up events prior to the @entity106 to prevent any further damage to a knee injury and did not sound convincing when asked his fitness			1
@entity96 , who joins englishmen @entity111 and @entity113 in the final , said : ‘ i ’m in pretty good form — held together by tape , but feeling pretty good			1
‘ ( the knee ) is fine			0
i ’m here , i jumped and it ’s okay			0
you manage these things and i ’m feeling pretty good			0
‘ i should do well at these games and if i do n’t it ’s a huge disappointment			0
i ’m here to do well and that ’s what i expect			0
’ in the way : @entity19 's @entity126 ( second left ) tussles with @entity128 runner @entity127 @entity129 sent a three - strong table tennis team to the @entity121 for the first time			2
but @entity132 showed his inexperience at 3 - 1 down to @entity134 of @entity135 in his first match			0
‘ i thought it was the best of five games , ’ said @entity132 , 30			0
‘ i did n’t realise it was seven			0
i was about to shake hands ! ’ @entity134 did n’t have to wait long for a handshake , taking the next game and the match			2
@entity145 champion and world record - holder @entity144 was the fastest qualifier for wednesday 's 800m semi-finals , but there was disappointment for @entity98 finalist @entity126			1
the @entity19 was disqualified for cutting across @entity128 ’ @entity127 as the pair jostled for position in the final metres			2
@entity126 said : ‘ there was a scuffle and there were people looking for gaps that were n’t there			0
‘ i would say it was not his space and you can always go round people			0
if you do n’t you will cause a collision			0
‘ that happened to me at the trials and somebody clipped my hamstring , and that has affected me coming into these championships			0
’ your fault : the @entity19 800m runner was n't happy with training partner			2
