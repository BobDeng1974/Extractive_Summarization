by @entity1 reporter when @entity3 and @entity4 decided they no longer wanted to raise @entity6 , the teenager they adopted from @entity9 , they went about getting rid of her the way one would an old refrigerator or furniture - they advertised her online			1
while traditional adoptions take months and usually years to finalize , @entity17 was snapped up by another family in less than two days			1
@entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity20 wrote an email to the @entity4 's expressing their interest in adopting @entity17			2
from their email exchanges , mrs @entity4 felt that the @entity50 ' seemed wonderful ' and were qualified enough to take in @entity6			0
. a few weeks later in october 2008 , they drove from their home in @entity53 to the @entity50 's in @entity20 and dropped @entity17 off at the mobile home park the teenager would now be calling home			0
new home : the @entity58 dropped off @entity17 at the @entity50 ' mobile home in @entity53			0
now , @entity30 lives at a different mobile home in @entity61 , @entity62 visit @entity63 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy visit @entity63 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy @entity17 's case is just one of many discovered by @entity72 and @entity73 in their investigation of ' private re-homing '			1
the term used to refer to the process of pet owners looking for new homes for their animals , but has now grown to include the re-homing of humans due to the similarity in advertisements placed online			1
but humans are not animals , and placing them with perfect strangers raises the risk of placing them with abusers			0
and that seems to have been the case with the @entity50			0
it turns out that child welfare authorities had taken away @entity30 's two biological children and a sheriff 's deputy wrote that she and her husband had ' severe psychiatric problems ' and ' violent tendencies '			2
@entity30 denies that her children were taken away from her , and says that they are still living with her - something authorities say is not true			1
and they had adopted children this way before on at least six occasions			1
in 2006 , @entity30 and another man , @entity103 , adopted a 10 - year - old boy online			1
convicted abuser : @entity30 , right , adopted a 10 - year - old boy with @entity103 , left , who was eventually arrested for sending and receiving child porn pedophile : @entity103 is currently serving a 20 - year sentence in federal prison			1
the 10 - year - old they adopted was placed in foster care and recently turned 18			1
his new parents declined to let him be interviewed later , @entity103 was arrested for sending and receiving child pornography and is currently serving a 20 - year sentence in federal prison			2
the 10 - year - old was sent to live with a foster family and just recently turned 18			1
his foster parents refused to let him be interviewed			0
on @entity17 's first night with the @entity50 , they told her to sleep in their bed , and @entity17 remembers that her adoptive mother was not wearing any clothing			0
when asked by @entity72 what her personal parenting style is , @entity30 responded : ' dude , just be a little mean , ok ? … i ’ll threaten to throw a knife at your a * * , i will			1
i ’ll chase you with a hose ' mother of the year : @entity30 says she 's a ' little mean ' when parenting , threatening to ' throw a knife at your a * * ' when @entity4 could n't get in contact with the @entity50 within days of dropping @entity17 off , she alerted the authorities and they tracked the girl down two weeks later and sent her back to @entity53 alone on a bus			0
now 21 , @entity17 lives by herself and is going to school			0
by herself : now 21 , @entity17 lives be herself in an apartment outside @entity143 , @entity53 and is going to school @entity146 nightmares : she says she thought @entity146 would be a safer place , but that ' it turned into a nightmare ' when she first came to @entity146 , she thought she was ' coming to a nicer place , a safer place			0
it did n't turn out that way			0
it turned into a nightmare '			0
and @entity17 was just one of many cases @entity72 found in their investigation of private re-homing			1
they found entire message boards on @entity159 and @entity160 dedicated to advertising adopted children and estimate that 70 per cent of the children offered were foreign - born adoptees			1
they come from countries all over the world , and range in age from as young as 10 months old to teenagers			0
@entity72 analyzed 5,029 posts on one @entity159 group page over five years			1
one adoptive mother 's post from march 2012 for her 12 - year - old daughter reads : ' i would have given her away to a serial killer , i was so desperate			2
' one adopted child from @entity178 says after she was re-homed , her new parents made her dig her own grave			2
a girl from @entity182 says she was re-home three times in six months			0
when she was 13 , she says she had sex with a boy at one of the homes and he urinated on her afterwards			2
after notifying @entity159 about the pages , the company has taken them down			0
but a similar page on @entity160 continues to run on a private basis			2
a spokesman for the social network said that the page shows ' that the internet is a reflection of society '			0
there is one safeguard in place to protect these children : the @entity201 on the @entity202			2
if a child is transferred into the custody of a new family in a different state , it requires both families to alart the authorities in both states so that prospective parents can be vetted			1
but there is no way for the @entity214 to hold these parents accountable if they do n't notify them			0
it was n't until january 2011 that a @entity214 official wrote a nationwide alert saying private re-homing online posed a ' grave danger ' to children and puts them ' at substantial risk			1

an investigation by @entity72 and @entity73 *uncovered* the process of ' private re-homing '
re-homing involves advertising *unwanted* adopted children online so they can be placed with a new family
the *transaction* happens between families so there are no safeguards to make sure the children are placed in safe homes
70 per cent of the advertised children are foreign - born
