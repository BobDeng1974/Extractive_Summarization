by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:47 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 21:07 est , 5 october 2013 an off - duty undercover @entity3 police detective who witnessed a violent confrontation between an suv driver and a group of bikers last week but failed to report it has been suspended as two of the alleged attackers turned themselves in			1
@entity13 , 38 , who police say is the biker seen in a video smashing his helmet against @entity19 â€™s suv and yanking him out of the vehicle , came forward friday night along with 35 - year - old @entity21			1
@entity21 , of @entity22 , has been charged with attempted assault , gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon			1
the 35 - year - old biking enthusiast has been identified as the person seen trying to open @entity19 's door , according to the @entity30			1
in custody : @entity13 , 38 ( pictured left and right ) surrendered himself to police in connection to the sunday attack on an suv driver meanwhile , @entity38 spokesman @entity37 confirmed saturday that the unnamed detective believed to be an off - duty narcotics officer and member of a biker club was stripped of his gun and badge pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation why it took the agent four days to come forward			1
he was riding with the @entity50 biker club , according to the @entity51			2
the papers aid the club also counts several others among its members			2
@entity37 said internal affairs was also trying to determine investigating whether any other officers were present during the sunday altercation and did n't immediately report it			1
it has been reported this week that at least five off - duty cops witnessed the beating of @entity19 , who was driving an suv on the @entity65 last sunday with his family inside			1
the incident left @entity19 needing stitches and motorcyclist @entity69 possibly paralyzed			1
among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack			1
one of the detectives , the undercover narcotics agent , watched as the violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his cover			1
undercover officers are required to immediately report being a witness to a crime			1
uniformed officers are required to take police action if they see a crime occurring , but the rules are murkier for undercover officers who face blowing their cover , confusing civilians who do n't realize the undercover is really a cop and ruining yearslong investigations			1
before and after : @entity69 suffered a broken spine , fractured ribs , a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again the five officers were not the only ones present , @entity100 is reporting that the @entity38 is investigating whether several off - duty corrections officers were also there			1
police who saw the violent attack did not begin coming forward until wednesday - four days later			1
it is believed that the 38 - year - old biker who was seen on the video smashing his helmet into the @entity112 's window is expected to turn himself in to police for his role in the melee , according to @entity100			1
it is not clear what further role , if any , he played in the fracas			2
investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the @entity124 video of the assault , according to @entity100			2
they plan to talk to as many as possible , the station noted			2
' this is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved , ' a source told @entity100			0
one of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that mr @entity19 ' drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side , ' adding ' when he bumped that bike on the side , that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger , ' according to @entity100			0
the @entity51 originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene , as several members of the motorcycle group - called the @entity146 - are police officers themselves			1
internal affairs of the @entity38 are now investigating whether or not any of these officers were the ones who were pictured hitting the @entity112 , though they do not seem to be worried that the undercover took part when reached by @entity156 for comment , an @entity38 spokesperson said only that the involvement of off - duty officers ' is under investigation			1
' ' it is does not appear that he got involved at the scene , ' a police source told @entity164			0
that said , the undercover officer has hired a lawyer			1
on camera : this shows the moment the @entity112 driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child			0
it is believed he hit @entity178 here smashed : when they come to a standstill in heavy traffic , it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle , smashing the driver 's window with his helmet he was not the only one to do so , as longtime partner of @entity69 , the man who was run over by the car , has hired famed defender @entity191			1
' he is the best father i know , ' @entity192 said at a friday press conference			2
' to learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again - that is all still sinking in			2
' it tears me up that anyone could think that @entity69 in anyway deserves what happened to him			1
' @entity178 was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black @entity112 on @entity205 's @entity204 last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped , police said			2
@entity208 captured at the scene shows the suv surrounded by helmeted riders			0
damage : the broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target of the bikers ' wrath scary : the @entity219 said they feared for their lives towed away : the car was brought to the @entity38 's 33 precinct on friday in the video , one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver 's side window			1
police said others tried to damage the suv before the driver , @entity19 , took off and plowed over @entity178			0
the bikers then chased after @entity19 and smashed his car window with their helmets , then pulled him from the suv and beat him to the point where he required stitches			0
@entity19 's wife , @entity238 , has said that her family 's sympathies go out to @entity178 , but that they had to flee a dangerous situation			0
' he is the best father i know , ' @entity192 , @entity178 ' longtime partner , said at a friday press conference support : ms @entity192 , seen with attorney @entity191 and @entity178 ' father @entity245 , said that they are still coping with how to deal with @entity69 's injuries she said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2 - year - old child , who was also in the car at the time			1
@entity178 , who is from @entity253 , @entity254 , suffered a broken spine , fractured ribs , a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve , said his attorney , @entity191			0
his injuries may have left him paralyzed			0
pain : ms @entity192 said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner ' he told everyone to move on and go back to riding , and turned his back to the suv to start walking back to his own bike , ' @entity191 said			2
' it was then , with his back to the suv , and as he was in front of it , that he was run over and crushed			0
' @entity192 said a difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a ' perception ' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on sunday			0
' they are not gang members			0
they are not thugs , ' @entity192 said			0
' they are @entity286 drivers , plumbers , military reservists , musicians			0
they are fathers and brothers and sons , and sisters and mothers			0
' she also said @entity178 did n't know any of the people he was riding with on sunday aside from one friend who traveled to @entity3 with him			0
@entity178 was recently arrested in @entity298 , @entity254 , for driving with a revoked license			0
he also never applied for a motorcycle license			0
records show that in june he was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017			0
it was n't clear if he had been licensed in any other state			0
