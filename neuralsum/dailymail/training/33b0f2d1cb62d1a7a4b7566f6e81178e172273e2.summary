she 's the former tv journalist turned princess who is set to become @entity2 of @entity3 within weeks			2
but princess @entity4 is famous for more than simply being the wife of the @entity3 king - in - waiting			1
the 41 - year - old mother - of - two has also carved out a name for herself as a royal style icon and even , on one memorable occasion , managed to outshine the ultra-glamorous @entity11			0
her current wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses , sky - scraping court shoes and eye - catching jewels is all a far cry from her early days as a newsreader , when she embraced the bland @entity19 suit and was rarely seen in public wearing anything else			1
style reinvention : from boxy ill - fitting blazers to on - trend city suits , @entity4 , pictured above this afternoon , has come a long way since her days as a newsreader @entity26 : before marrying in to the @entity3 royal family , @entity4 's newsreader job meant she clung faithfully to grey tailored trouser suits but since marrying @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , in 2004 , her wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation			1
out went grey suits and in came a more colourful , feminine style - although , as a recent appearance at the a reception for members of the @entity44 at the @entity45 in @entity46 revealed , she 's yet to give up the black			0
so what are the secrets of princess @entity4 's enviable style ? like the @entity51 , she knows what suits her lean body shape and is partial to a knee - length shift dress and a bracelet sleeve			1
she adores a leg - lengthening nude heel and is almost as addicted to her @entity58 suede tan court shoes as @entity51 is to her nude patent @entity62 ' @entity61 ' heels			2
in @entity4 's case , that means slim - fitting sheath dresses picked up in @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 - many of which she wears time and time again			1
that , however , does n't mean she wo n't splash out on a more expensive frock should one catch her eye			0
her favourite piece is reportedly a black guipure lace dress by local designer , @entity131 , which she wore on a state visit to @entity134 in 2012 , again for her 40th birthday party and again in march this year			2
another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by @entity139 which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer			0
off duty , the princess ' style becomes markedly more relaxed , with cropped trousers , billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the bulk of her wardrobe			0
but as her occasional foray back into grey @entity139 tailored trousers reveals , some style habits die hard - @entity2 - to - be or not			0
battle of the first ladies : princess @entity4 manages to upstage former model @entity11 during a state visit from former @entity157 premier @entity156 in 2009 gorgeous : princess @entity4 has n't lost her love for grey but knows how to make it work for her elegant : princess @entity4 is chic in a nude lace dress at the @entity163 in @entity164 floral reign : @entity4 makes the most of her slender figure in a pretty floral shift dress idyllic : @entity4 and her daughters @entity96 and @entity171 pictured in the royal gardens in an official photo taken during summer 2012 modern mother : princess @entity4 cut a glamorous figure in this recent photo of @entity3 's royal couple with their two daughters in the grounds of the @entity72 palace chic : princess @entity4 is glamorous in a tweed two - piece in this royal family photo with @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , @entity188 royal favour : @entity4 has embraced sheath dresses and brights , although her favourite is thought to be a @entity131 guipure lace dress worn for her birthday portrait ( r )			1

princess @entity4 , 41 , has become increasingly stylish during her decade - long marriage to @entity3 's @entity32
the future queen of @entity3 has swapped newsreader grey for glamorous sheath dresses and heels
like the @entity51 , she 's a fan of the high street with @entity123 , @entity122 and @entity124 among favourites
she 's also partial to a designer *buy* with local name @entity131 and @entity139 filling the rails in her wardrobe
