by @entity0 any mere mortal would cower at the thought of having to face the human wrecking ball that is @entity4 but @entity5 is relishing the challenge of stopping the @entity7 in saturday 's first test at @entity9			1
@entity11 's midfield defence will be tested mercilessly by @entity4 and his @entity7 team - mates as they look to exploit a potential weakness in @entity15 's side			1
@entity5 will deputise at inside centre after @entity17 failed to win his fitness battle and he will partner fourth choice fly - half @entity19 , who had a difficult season at @entity22 , in an inexperienced midfield			1
ready : @entity5 is relishing the prospect of facing @entity4 and the @entity7 on saturday undercooked ? the inside centre is fourth choice in his position and has not played since april inexperienced : @entity5 and fly - half @entity19 ( centre ) have only seven caps between them the diminutive @entity5 , who has not played since april , will be winning only his third cap and @entity19 just his fourth			1
but @entity5 is ready for the assault that awaits when the series begins in @entity37			2
he said : ' i 've been playing rugby now since i was seven years old			2
you have to make tackles , it 's as simple as that			0
' ' it 's an attitude thing that has to be shared by everyone , it 's not an individual thing			0
' @entity7 have some big guys , but we 've put in a lot of homework throughout the team to give us the best opportunity against them			2
' i 'll try to offer exactly what i 've done throughout my career - try to get on the ball and bring energy and spark to help out my team - mates			0
' @entity15 's choice at inside centre is limited due to @entity17 ' injury , as well as @entity62 and @entity63 being unavailable after appearing in last saturday 's @entity65 final			1
headache : @entity11 head coach @entity15 has had to select his side from a much depleted squad wrecking ball : @entity4 ( centre ) and his @entity7 team - mates will look to exploit @entity11 's new midfield and @entity5 himself fell out of favour at @entity75 and has been omitted from their matchday 23 since			1
the 24 - year - old rugby league convert , who impressed during last summer 's tour to @entity81 , is fourth choice but is determined to grab the opportunity with both hands			1
' we 've put some good work in and i 'm feeling all right			0
i 've played a lot of games this season so match fitness is not something i have in mind at all , ' @entity5 said			2
' i 'm confident i 'll be okay with the match fitness			0
i 've trained well and hard over the last couple of weeks			0
' primed and ready : @entity7 train ahead of saturday 's first test with @entity11 at @entity9 captain marvel : all @entity7 captain @entity98 focuses in training ahead of the match with @entity11 @entity5 has lost ground in @entity11 's pecking order this season with @entity17 and @entity62 overtaking him , but he takes a measured view on his progress			1
' i have to put it into perspective where i 'm at			0
this is the end of my second season in rugby union , ' he said			0
' the players who have been playing in my position have been playing really well			0
' @entity62 got his chance and @entity17 played well throughout the @entity115			1
' i 've had to be patient and wait for my chance			0

@entity5 is not *daunted* by the prospect of facing the @entity7 centre
he deputises for the injured @entity17 but has not played since april
@entity11 play @entity7 in the first test at @entity9 on saturday
the 24 - year - old is fourth choice in his position , as is fly - half @entity19
the rugby league convert hopes to make the most of his opportunity
