this portrait of the @entity12 painted 60 years ago was rejected because critics said it looked nothing like her and her neck was ' too long '			2
this portrait of the queen by @entity19 was rejected after criticis said it looked nothing like her in 1952 much better : @entity12 pictured in 1953 in @entity24			1
the @entity19 portrait was said to look nothing like her the painting by @entity19 was especially commissioned by @entity28 for the @entity29 in 1953			1
but it faced such criticism at the time it was quickly shelved and @entity19 was sent back to the drawing board to start again			1
a second version with a shorter neck was eventually accepted			0
last week @entity6 's first official portrait faced a barrage of withering criticism from art lovers who branded it ' rotten ' , ' ghastly ' and ' ordinary '			1
@entity43 's painting was also subjected to a deluge of @entity46 alterations by amateur artists who then posted their work on @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity51 of @entity52 was more polite , insisting she was ' thrilled ' with the oil painting and praising it as ' amazing '			0
another royal portrait which was slammed by art critics has gone on display at @entity28 artist @entity43 has faced a slew of criticism for his portrait of @entity6 which some of has said makes her look much older mr @entity19 , who died in 2001 , famously said of his first effort : ' it 's a beautiful painting of a queen , but not this @entity12 '			1
he also painted @entity65 but his best works were said to be his still lives which attracted the praise of prince @entity69			0
trustees at @entity71 in @entity72 have announced the portrait will be permanently showcased there to mark the 60th anniversary of the @entity29			0
@entity72 's deputy lord mayor @entity75 said : " we are very proud that @entity72 now has the original first painting hanging in @entity71 , which has been rehung to celebrate the anniversary of the @entity29			2
' it will be the first thing people will see if they come to get married or have a civil partnership or attend a citizenship ceremony			0
' royal row : portraits of both @entity6 , left , and the @entity12 , right , have been subjected to criticism failing failing to look like them			2

@entity19 's effort was slammed by critics when it was **unveiled** in 1953
@entity28 ordered him to start again and shelved the original
looks even less like subject than portrait of @entity6 **unveiled** last week
