@entity6 was told she should not put up the traditional @entity2 display on the porch of her home in @entity11 , south @entity12 because of fears she might fall			1
her landlords have now backed down and agreed she can leave the inflatable snowman and @entity8 in place over the festive season but she was left stunned this year when she received a letter from her landlords telling her they breached health and safety regulations			1
@entity26 said they feared the 50 - year - old could fall while putting them up and threatened to take them down before @entity2			1
the letter she received from the housing association stated : ' following the recent site visit to look at the @entity2 decorations it has been decided that they must be removed from the porch roof			1
' this decision has been made on health and safety grounds			0
we can not allow residents access to the roof via the communal window and trailing extension leads through the communal areas			0
' i understand you have gone through the expense of purchasing the decoration but permission should have been asked before putting them up			0
landlords insist mrs @entity6 must allow them to remove the display of @entity8 and a snowman from her porch ' i would ask that you do not go back out on the roof and we 'll arrange an appointment with you to bring in the decorations			1

' i told the council i would take full responsibility for myself if an accident did happen but that 's not enough for them			0
' people are always telling me how festive it looks			2
the children and grandchildren love seeing @entity8 in lights			0
' but i had a letter through this week telling me i 'm not allowed to do it and that they would send someone out to take them down			2
' they said it 's for health and safety reasons			0
i could n't believe it			0
' @entity26 confirmed they were concerned about the display , but have since agreed to leave them up			2
a spokesman said : ' the roof is about 12ft off the ground and only accessible by a window			0
' the safety of tenants was of paramount importance and we were concerned that she may fall			0
' in this instance , we would have been happy to help ms @entity6 put up the @entity2 decorations			1
' the decorations can remain as long as she agrees not to go back out onto the roof again			0
when @entity2 is over so we can take the decorations down ourselves			1
' the government ordered a purge on health and safety @entity110 who ruin the spirit of @entity2 three years ago			2
