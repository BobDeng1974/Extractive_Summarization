by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 15:10 est , 14 march 2014 from a simple coat of nail polish to incredibly intricate and beautiful works of art , the manicure is fast becoming a fashion statement in its own right , complete withs trends , fads and ever - changing designs			1
but if you thought the manicure was a relatively modern phenomenon , a major new book is set to prove you wrong			0
nails : the @entity17 draws on pop culture images to shed light on a strand of fashion history that has its roots in ancient @entity23			2
historic : the roots of the manicure go back more than 3,000 years to @entity27 and queens like @entity29 pride and joy : @entity32 was famous for her manicured nails as were members of @entity36 's @entity35 beloved of royal ladies such as the famously beautiful @entity38 , the earliest manicures involved rubbing oil and incense into the hands before painting the nails with herbal strengthening potions and colouring them using henna			1
the earliest @entity36 royals , and the @entity35 that followed , were also fans of painted nails , with a bizarre - sounding mixture of wax , egg whites , gelatin and rubber used to dye the fingertips crimson and black			1
@entity55 living in what is now modern @entity57 are also known to have loved and cared for their nails , with the world 's oldest manicure set - made from solid gold and dated to 3,200 bc - discovered in the country			1
in the @entity65 and elsewhere in @entity66 , possessing neat , manicured nails became a mark of affluence during the medieval and @entity71 periods , while @entity32 was widely feted for her beautiful hands			1
bizarre : some unusual nail care has proved popular in the past , including using gelatin on the nails bright spark : bold hot pink and red were enormously popular in the 1980s and paired with power dressing but not all parts of the modern manicure set are so old : the emery board , now a staple part of the kit , was n't invented until 1830 when an @entity87 doctor named sits created the first one			1
the cheap and cheerful nail care system he later devised quickly spread around the world , forming the basis for the elaborate looks that make up much of author @entity95 's tome			0
@entity95 , a researcher at @entity96 at the @entity97 in @entity98 , charts the manicure 's progress from basic grooming to serious style statement , taking in fabulous photos by @entity105 greats @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 in the process			0
it concludes with a look at modern nail trends and their exponents , whether trendy @entity114 in @entity115 which promises to ' turn fashion trends into fingernail art ' or the nail expos in @entity119 where people enter their own wacky designs into competitions			2
spectacular : modern nail art created by @entity125 ( left ) and by @entity126 ( right ) stunning : nail art and photography by @entity129 , @entity130 for @entity131 but its not all crazy nail art. as @entity95 points out , each decade of the last century has had its own distinctive nail shapes and designs , with colours and looks sliding in and out of fashion			2
the @entity140 manicure , for example , was very fashionable in the 1920 and 1930s , while the arrival of the ' power - dressing ' look for women in the 1980s - think shoulder pads and an epic blow - dry - heralded the arrival of strong , deep reds and purples			0
while modern manicures are n't quite the luxury item they once were , as @entity95 reveals , they 're still one of the most creative parts of the beauty industry			0
roll on the next 100 years ! nails : the story of the @entity156 by @entity95 , ( Â£ 19.99 , @entity157 ) is released on 24th march and can be pre-ordered on @entity158 click on images for more info ... competition : nail art fans at the @entity163 , where they compete to create the most outre nails elaborate : the competition draws fans from all over the world and includes some detailed , if wacky , designs			0
