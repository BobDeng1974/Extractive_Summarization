' first minister @entity2 said mr @entity9 made a ' mistake ' but is under pressure over attacks on opponents to independence @entity24 conservative leader @entity147 said : ' for such slurs and misinformation to be spread by one of the first minister 's taxpayer - funded key advisers is a new low for the @entity17 government in this referendum debate			1
