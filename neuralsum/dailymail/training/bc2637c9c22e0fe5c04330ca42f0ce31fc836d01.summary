occupy @entity1 protesters have begun to squabble over money with some demanding a reported $ 500,000 the movement has in its bank be shared more equally			1
and with the cold weather beginning to take a firm grip on @entity8 , doubts have been raised as to whether the anti-corporation demonstration can make it through the winter			2
it has also emerged that @entity13 , the focus of the protest since it begun on september 17 , is providing an alluring home for vagrants , at the same time as those within the movement cautioned against spreading the demonstration too thinly			1
the beat goes on : @entity20 , age four from @entity22 , @entity8 joins demonstrators with @entity1 continue their protest at @entity13 in @entity8 today protesters of all ages : @entity27 , age 5 , joined demonstrations today if you need some , take some : protesters are falling out over the allotment of nearly $ 500,000 worth of donations ironic ? news of a fallout over money seems to run in contrast with the anti-corporation ethos of the @entity1 movement bedding down : the increasingly cold winter weather is also a cause for concern for protesters , who are not allowed to erect tents yet given @entity1 's ( @entity1 ) anti-establishment ethos , the main worry for the hundreds camped out in @entity8 's financial district will be the battle over money			1
donations are pouring in , but gripes over how that money is spent is threatening to split the protesters apart			1
a finance committee has been set up to deal with cashflow , and assign it to working collectives with the movement so essential items can be bought			1
but those denied funds are getting angry			1
for example , a set of drums was vandalised one night last week , however the @entity55 has refused a request for $ 8,000 to replace them			1
i hope mayor @entity70 gets an injunction and demands to see the movement ’s books , ' @entity67 , a 45 - year - old protester who joined @entity1 from @entity68 three weeks ago told the @entity74			2
' we need to know how much money we really have and where it ’s going			1
' mr @entity67 , who works in tv production , is a member of the @entity79 , which is charged with finding out what basic necessities campers need , such as thermal underwear , and then raising money by asking for donations on the street , the @entity74 reported			1
working groups : a number of groups have been set up with defined purposes , but some are getting annoyed at requests for money being turned down tents please : a petition is underway to push for tents to be allowed at @entity13 , but mayor @entity70 is resistant to relaxing the laws			1
tarpaulin sheets must make do instead advice : on - site nurses are telling people to stay wrapped up and dry , words which this little pooch has heeded ' the other day , i took in $ 2,000			2
i kept $ 650 for my group , and gave the rest to @entity66 , he told the paper			0
' then i went to them with a request - so many people need things , and they should not be going without basic comfort items - and i was told to fill out paperwork			0
paperwork ! are they the government now ? ' we need winter gear , shoes , socks			0
i could spend $ 10,000 alone for backpacks people need			0
we raise all this money			1
where is it ? ' one rainy night last week , someone stabbed holes in many of the protesters ' drums with a knife , @entity124 told the @entity74			1
the 19 - year - old , a founder of the @entity132 , asked for $ 8,000 to replace the drums , and build a small shed to lock them up			0
' they said no - they turned us down			0
i ’m really frustrated , ' he told the paper			0
haven for the homeless : there are reports of vagrants moving to @entity13 in @entity8 because of community feel and free food @entity148 , 36 , a @entity149 tattoo artist studying a master 's in finance and sits on the @entity55 , said big purchases ca n't get the green light straight away			1
' we do n’t have the power for that			0
they have to go to the @entity158			0
if it 's approved , we pay out that amount and make sure everything is accounted for , ' he told the @entity74			0
the funding fight emerged as a number of protesters voiced concerns over the coming freezing temperatures - as tents are forbidden			1
at night , the several hundred people who sleep on site in the financial district currently huddle together using plastic tarps , sleeping bags and emergency blankets			0
but the worst is yet to come			0
' so far , we have been extremely blessed , ' @entity175 , who has slept at @entity13 for 18 days , told @entity176			1
@entity13 has so far experienced only a handful of rainy days , while at night , temperatures are still above freezing			1
however @entity8 winters often see temperatures drop below @entity181 ( -10c ) and some are beginning to worry			2
' the cold affects us already , ' @entity183 , a volunteer nurse at the protesters ' makeshift infirmary , told @entity176			2
soaked : rainy nights have so far been few , but @entity188 got caught in a shower last wednesday , and weather is expected to worsen she described how there had been several cases of hypothermia and respiratory problems			2
an online petition is asking @entity8 mayor @entity70 to allow protesters to erect tents on the plaza , though it has not yet been sent			1
its chances of success seem slim , though , with mr @entity70 saying earlier this week : ' the @entity205 does n't protect tents , it protects speech and assembly			2
' but ms @entity183 , who has been teaching protesters basic methods for battling the cold , insisted that they formed ' a determined group that plans to stay until it changes			2
' she is informing demonstrators to stay dry , wear hats , layers of clothing and good pairs of socks and gloves , @entity176 reported			2
meanwhile the @entity220 has reported a growing number of homeless people are flocking to the site , as it provides a safe , community environment , along with free food			0
' i think this is a better situation to be involved with , ' 49 - year - old @entity226 , who was released from prison last month and spent time in a @entity229 shelter , told the @entity220			0
' i am around a good cause and around positive people , rather than in that other environment , ' @entity226 , who has drifted in and out of the state prison system for more than three decades for a variety of crimes , including robbery and possession of stolen property , told the paper			0
@entity243 couple @entity242 and @entity244 told the @entity220 they were forced into a shelter a year ago when they could no longer afford rent			0
' i feel safer out here than i did in a shelter , ' ms @entity242 , 45 , said			0
' it 's a big area with a lot of kind people			0
' organisers yesterday put up a large flat - screen tv in @entity13 for a movie night in an effort to attract new recruits following a lacklustre showing at a police - brutality event in @entity260 which attracted only 50 participants .			1
