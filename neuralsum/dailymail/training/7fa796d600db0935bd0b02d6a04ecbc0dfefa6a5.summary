increased temperatures on @entity2 's @entity1 are not a result of human - caused climate change , but rather naturally occurring wind changes according to a new study			1
the 1 degree fahrenheit of warming that has been recorded on the coast of the northwest @entity10 is due to weaker winds and changing ocean circulation , not a buildup of greenhouse gasses			1
these weaker winds accounted for more than 80 % of the warming trend along the @entity18 coast between @entity19 and @entity20 , and 60 % of the warming in @entity22			0
' changing winds appear to explain a very large fraction of the warming from year to year , decade to decade and the long - term , ' said study leader @entity40 according to the @entity41			2
the slower the wind gets , the less evaporation that occurs , which then leads to lower pressure , less rain , and , over time , higher temperatures			0
greenhouse gasses do , however			0
play some role in the rising temperature , just not as much as had been assumed in this region of the world			0
most of the warming occurred between 1900 and 1940 the study found , when the wind was much weaker and greenhouse gasses far , far lower			2
keeps rising : temperatures in places like @entity19 ( above ) have increased roughly 1 degree fahrenheit over the past 100 years some however are calling this study into question , including @entity64 , a climate scientist at the @entity66 , who questions if there is enough data , and the quality of the data , from the first half of the twentieth century to make these claims			1
he also said this study in no way calls into question ' the concept of global warming			1

according to a new study increased temperatures on the @entity1 of @entity2 are the result of changing wind *patterns* , not global warming
temperatures in that area have increased about 1 degree fahrenheit over the past 100 years
this from a study conducted by researchers from the @entity34 and the @entity35
