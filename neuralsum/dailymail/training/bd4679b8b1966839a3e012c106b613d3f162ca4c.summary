the @entity0 did not receive a video of @entity2 knocking out his fiancee in a casino elevator before it was published online after they failed to investigate the case properly , according to an independent review			1
' the @entity0 should have done more with the information it had and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the february 15 incident , ' former @entity9 director @entity8 said in a statement after releasing his 96 - page report on thursday			1
the @entity16 running back was only suspended for two games after his arrest for punching his now - wife @entity20 during a night out at an @entity23 , @entity22 casino in february			1
after video of the incident emerged on @entity26 , he was released by the team and suspended indefinitely from the league , although the latter decision was ultimately reversed			1
' should have done more ' : @entity0 commissioner @entity30 , pictured in october , did not see the video of @entity2 punching his fiancee in an elevator before it emerged online , according to an independent review in his report , @entity8 said he can find no evidence the league received the video of the incident			1
a law enforcement official previously said he had mailed a dvd to @entity0 headquarters in april			1
the report said a review of phone records and emails of @entity0 employees showed no evidence that anyone in the league had seen the video before commissioner @entity30 suspended @entity2			1
the private investigation without subpoena power did not include any contact with the law enforcement official who claimed the dvd had been sent to the league			0
the officer had also played the @entity59 a 12 - second voicemail from an @entity0 office number dated april 9 , in which a woman verifies receipt of the dvd and says : ' you 're right , it 's terrible			2
' the official , who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to share the evidence , said he took steps to avoid being found or identified by the @entity0			2
' we have reviewed the report and stand by our original reporting , ' said @entity73 , the @entity59 's executive editor			0
' the @entity8 team did ask us for source material and other newsgathering information , but we declined			2
everything that we report and confirm goes into our stories			0
we do not offer up reporters ' notes and sources			0
' brutal : elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that @entity2 punched his then - fiancee @entity20 in the face in an @entity23 casino elevator			0
she can be seen on the floor after the knockout punch free agent : @entity2 , pictured with his wife @entity20 outside court in november , was initially suspended for two games and then released by the @entity16 over the footage			1
he successfully appealed and is now a free agent @entity8 's report disputed this , saying that investigators ' found no evidence that anyone at the @entity0 had or saw the in - elevator video before it was publicly shown '			1
' we also found no evidence that a woman at the @entity0 acknowledged receipt of that video in a voicemail message , ' @entity8 said			1
investigators spoke with @entity30 and more than 50 @entity0 employees , all 188 women who had been in the @entity0 office building on the day of the supposed voicemail , and looked at e-mails from all league officials , many of which contradicted the notion they might have viewed the elevator video			2
the probe also searched more than 400 @entity0 employee computers plus mobile phones of top @entity0 executives			0
' we found no evidence the in - elevator video was or had been stored or viewed on a league computer prior to the video 's public release , ' @entity8 said			2
but @entity8 also found the @entity0 's deference to the law enforcement process involving @entity2 ' led to deficiencies in the league 's collection and analysis of information during its investigation			1
' the approach ' can foster an environment in which it is less important to understand precisely what a player did than to understand how and when the criminal justice system addresses the event			0
' findings : former fbi director @entity8 , pictured in 2013 , concluded in his report , which was released on thursday , that the @entity0 had substantial information about the case and could have obtained more @entity8 's report details some of the efforts the @entity0 made in obtaining the video , but said the league should have taken additional steps to find out what happened inside the elevator			1
' @entity156 investigators did not contact any of the police officers who investigated the incident , the @entity153 , or the @entity154 to attempt to obtain or view the in - elevator video or to obtain other information , ' the report said			0
' no one from the league asked @entity2 or his lawyer whether they would make available for viewing the in - elevator video they received as part of criminal discovery in early april			1
' the report also said the league did n't follow up on initial conversations with the @entity16 to determine whether the team had more information			2
the official showed the @entity59 multiple videos from the casino the night @entity2 was arrested			0
those videos included security cameras from inside and outside the elevator and two cellphone videos that included some audio			0
the league said it considered the video published by @entity26 in september to be new evidence meriting an indefinite suspension			2
scandal : @entity186 appeared at a press conference about the incident with her husband in may ( pictured ) and apologized for her part - later claiming that the @entity16 had encouraged her to do so its emergence drew renewed backlash to the league from women 's organizations , members of @entity198 and players - all calling for more detail on how the @entity0 handled the case			2
@entity203 owner @entity202 and @entity205 president @entity204 , the men appointed by @entity30 as liaison 's to the investigation , said @entity8 made six recommendations that the owners will review			0
@entity211 and @entity212 discussed the report 's recommendations with @entity30 on thursday			0
@entity211 and @entity212 agreed that the league 's policy on domestic violence was insufficient			0
' we were slow to react , and in the case of @entity2 , the original punishment was insufficient , ' their statement said			0
' in addition , the steps taken by the @entity0 to investigate this matter were inadequate			0
since then , a new policy concerning domestic violence and other rules for conduct violations have been put into place			0
' in the wake of the knockout punch video becoming public , @entity2 was released by the @entity16			1
he won a legal appeal in november to overturn the indefinite suspension but did not play in the 2014 @entity0 season and remains a free agent .			1

independent review by former @entity9 director @entity8 said the @entity0 should have obtained all the information about the february attack
the report did not find any evidence that the @entity0 had received a copy of the footage in april , as an official had previously claimed
@entity2 was suspended for two games but after the video emerged in september he was released by the @entity16 and suspended indefinitely
he successfully appealed the suspension and remains a free agent
