@entity0 , the @entity2 ’s inclusion advisory board member axed for speaking out about a lack of action over discriminatory issues , has seriously upset @entity2 bosses again			1
the @entity2 claim @entity0 is attending matches and attempting to gain access to @entity10 hospitality areas to meet people on the basis of still being on the inclusion panel — behaviour @entity2 general secretary @entity14 has described as ‘ abhorrent ’			1
but @entity0 counters that he has still been invited to clubs despite no longer being on the @entity1 and only met problems at @entity17			1
he has also been to games at @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity14 ( left ) has written a letter to @entity0 over his conduct after leaving @entity2 post @entity14 said in a letter to lord : ‘ even as a serving @entity1 member , i would find this strange when there is no rationale for such activity			1
‘ as an ex-member of the @entity1 , i find this behaviour truly abhorrent and i would ask you to cease and desist with immediate effect			1
’ @entity0 wrote back : ‘ when i was a member of @entity1 it was agreed that i would continue to visit clubs at my own expense to liaise with senior figures on inclusion matters			1
‘ no club withdrew their invitation after my office told them of my change of circumstances			1
it only became an issue at @entity17			1
’ @entity49 ( right ) will miss the @entity50 as he 's away on @entity52 duty with @entity53 the @entity55 vote that propelled @entity57 star @entity56 to second place in last year ’s @entity50 vote could put @entity60 winner @entity49 on the @entity50 podium in @entity62 along with @entity63 and @entity64			2
but @entity49 wo n’t be there on the night as he will be on @entity52 duty with @entity53 in @entity67			2
@entity68 , who has shown minimal interest in sport since becoming @entity71 , has nevertheless added his signature to a letter to @entity52 president @entity74 calling for the @entity76 report into @entity52 bid corruption to be published in full			2
however , @entity68 ’s support for the online secondary ticket market is likely to mean that @entity80 - led efforts to regulate the sale of @entity84 tickets by touts will be scuppered by the government			2
@entity68 has called for the @entity76 report in @entity52 bid corruption to be published in full @entity87 are involved in a wide consultation process on whether to tweak their elite focus on winning medals to also fund a popular , diverse team sport such as basketball , which has no medal prospects			2
yet there seems no appetite among the @entity87 hierarchy to change their strategy , which chairman @entity100 describes as ‘ massively successful ’			0
the best solution — which rowing grandee sir @entity102 backs — sees grassroots funding agency @entity104 charged with funding sports that do n’t fit the medal - winning criteria			0
and the band play on the future of the @entity104 supporters ’ band after its drumbeat backing of an @entity114 chant has been brought into sharp focus by @entity117 chief @entity116 having to apologise for singing pro-ira songs			0
@entity119 said sorry on tuesday for joining in the singing of rebel ballad @entity121 in a @entity124 bar after the @entity126 ’s victory over the @entity127			0
@entity117 lawyers initially denied the incident had happened but footage was posted on @entity131			0
@entity117 chief @entity116 ( right ) has been forced to apologise after being caught singing an @entity134 rebel song @entity119 , who was celebrating the victory with a group of 16 , said : ‘ when you sing a song like that , you do n’t believe every word			0
it ’s a typically @entity134 thing we do			0
but if the song offends anybody , of course i ’m sorry			0
’ it was expected after the @entity104 band ’s accompaniment during the @entity150 friendly at @entity151 to repeated chants of ‘ @entity153 ’ that they would n’t be welcome by the @entity134 football authorities at the @entity155 , where @entity104 play @entity126 on june 7			0
that will be @entity104 ’s first match in @entity124 since the 1995 fixture was abandoned due to crowd violence			0
but @entity119 said after his own @entity153 - connected controversy : ‘ we will work closely with the @entity2 over the band and any other crowd issue			1
‘ @entity104 fans have been brilliant in recent years and i regard what happened in @entity62 with the band as a one - off			0

@entity0 was *sacked* for comments on action taken over discriminatory issues
@entity2 claim he is using old title to attend games and gain access to @entity10 areas
@entity14 has written to @entity0 over his ' abhorrent ' behaviour
