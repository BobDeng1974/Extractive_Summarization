by @entity0 last updated at 3:07 pm on 10th january 2012 @entity2 chief : sir @entity3 said the move was a ' logical ' progression schools are facing no - notice spot checks from @entity2 in a move which will effectively prevent teachers from ' hiding ' unruly pupils from inspectors			1
inspectors will start making unannounced visits later this year in a bid to get a true picture of performance in schools			0
the system shake - up comes less than a week after allegations surfaced claiming that some disruptive pupils are being bribed up to £ 100 to stay away from lessons during @entity2 inspections			1
all schools will face the no - notice inspections from this autumn , the new @entity2 chief announced today			1
sir @entity3 said the move was a ' logical ' progression , adding that it was vital that the public had confidence in inspections			1
however , school leaders warned they had ' real doubts ' that the plans would improve inspections , and raised concerns that the change had been announced without consulting headteachers			2
sir @entity3 , who took up his post as chief inspector last week , said the introduction of new guidelines for inspections provided a ' good opportunity ' to cut the notice period given to schools			1
he said : ' we are introducing no - notice inspections for all schools from this september , not just those that are causing concern			1
' there are a number of reasons			0
first of all it ’s a logical progression from the situation years ago when there was a year ’s notice , then it was two weeks , and in 2005 it went to two days			2
' that ’s one reason			0
the second is we have a new framework , which is really important , that ’s just come in			0
' it provides an opportunity for inspectors to do what ’s really important - going in and inspecting quality , particularly teaching			2
' under the new guidelines , inspectors no longer have to spend time going through documentation before visits , he said			0
no place to hide : @entity2 inspectors are to make unannounced visits to schools which will stop teachers from trying to hide unruly pupils ( file photo ) the launch of @entity2 ’s new @entity82 website means that parents do not have to be sent questionnaires before an inspection as they can give their views year round			1
sir @entity3 added : ' there ’s no reason why they ca n’t go in and go straight into the classroom in the first hour of the visit			0
' he acknowledged that it was vital that the public has ' absolute confidence in the integrity of inspections '			2
last week fresh concerns were raised that some schools were attempting to trick @entity2 by using tactics such as sending weak teachers and unruly pupils home when inspectors were visiting			1
he said : ' we want to make sure that the public views the process as something that ’s rigorous and robust and there ’s no question that schools are not going to follow the rules			0
' he added that the ' great majority of schools conduct themselves properly ' , but said if there is any sense that a school is not , then @entity2 needs to deal with it			1
model behaviour : sir @entity3 said the ' great majority ' of schools conducted themselves properly but added if any did not @entity2 would ' need to deal with it ' ( file photo ) sir @entity3 admitted that some schools may be wary of the change , saying : ' in my experience , anything that ’s new is going to be treated with some nervousness by schools			1
' once the process is established he said he believes it will be accepted			0
sir @entity3 said he wants inspectors to spend ' as much time as possible in the classroom '			0
he added : ' i do n’t want them to spend a huge amount of time looking at documentation , there ’s too much of that , i want them to go in and observe lessons			0
' @entity144 , general secretary of the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) , said : ' we welcome moves to improve the effectiveness of inspection , but i have real doubts that no - notice inspection will accomplish this			1
' why has he announced this significant change before that important consultation with school leaders has taken place ? ' ' an effective inspection system is based on mutual trust and respect , not the premise that schools are trying to " cheat " and need to be caught out			0
if it is going to lead to improvement , inspection needs to be done with schools rather than used as a beating stick			0
' he added : ' we welcome sir @entity3 ’s commitment to engage with the profession to improve the effectiveness of @entity2 , but that begs the question why he has announced this significant change before that important consultation with school leaders has taken place			2
' earlier this week it was claimed that disruptive pupils were being bribed up to £ 100 each to stay away from lessons during @entity2 inspections			1
despite having good attendance records , poorly - behaved students are being paid to truant to prevent their schools getting bad ratings , it was alleged			2
such underhand tactics are being increasingly used to trick inspectors , according to teachers			0
other methods include headteachers ‘ borrowing ’ outstanding staff from neighbouring schools to take lessons while telling their own weak teachers to go off sick			0
some also take brilliant artwork on loan from other schools to impress inspectors			0
@entity2 has carried out about 1,500 unannounced inspections in the last 18 months of schools which were causing concern			1
this included a pilot of no - notice visits to schools where there were concerns about behaviour			1
and sir @entity3 said the feedback from these inspections had been ' very , very positive '			2
he will formally announce the move to no - notice inspections as part of a package of reforms in a speech early next week			1
@entity213 , general secretary of the @entity214 ( @entity214 ) , said : ' it is disturbing to see @entity2 change its position in a matter of days and suggests the policy has been created with an eye more to the soundbite than the evidence			2
' if a school could conceal evidence of widespread failure in just two days , then the whole concept of inspection is flawed and @entity2 's protestations that it examines progress and behaviour over the long - term ring hollow			1
' @entity232 , head of education policy at the @entity234 ( @entity234 ) , said : ' while we totally agree that teachers should be held accountable for how well they teach , tinkering with the amount of notice for inspections will not improve education for the vast majority of children and young people			2
' we also remain deeply concerned about the use of the online @entity82 questionnaire			0
' any survey which allows people to ' opt - in ' is likely to attract more critical responses than positive ones , and this one is unlikely to reflect the education most children receive at a school			0

move comes amid claims that disruptive pupils are being ' bribed ' to stay away during inspections
