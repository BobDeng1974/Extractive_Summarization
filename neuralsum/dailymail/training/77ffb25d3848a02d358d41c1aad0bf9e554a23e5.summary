by @entity0 last updated at 7:03 pm on 4th november 2011 good news : lower petrol prices for drivers is welcomed by the @entity4 , but towns without an @entity6 could pay 8p more supermarket giant @entity6 sparked a price war today by slashing its pump prices to their lowest level since february – by knocking up to 2p a litre off petrol			1
@entity12 ’s swiftly announced its own price cut and forecourts run by oil giants were set to follow			1
but the @entity4 , while welcoming the moves , warned that motorists could be paying up to 8p a litre more in towns where there is not an @entity6 supermaket forcing prices down			1
it also warned motorists that the relief may be short - lived because of the volatility of oil and currency fluctuations , and the actions of speculators in the market			1
@entity6 said that drivers filling up at its 192 filling stations would pay a maximum of 128.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 136.7p a litre for diesel after cutting 2p off unleaded and 1p off diesel			1
@entity12 swiftly followed @entity6 ’s lead by announcing its own 2p a litre cut on unleaded and 1p per litre on diesel			1
but the supermarket refused to say what its average prices were by insisting it ‘ priced locally ’ and would be too difficult to work out the average			0
however , latest forecourt fuel - price data from @entity49 for mid-october show @entity12 ’s average price to be 132.60p for petrol and 137.63p for diesel – against which any subsequent price cuts can be judged by consumers			2
@entity6 said a separate sample survey taken from @entity57 on november 2 shows that some retailers are getting away with charging up to 8p a litre more in towns where there is no competition from an @entity6 supermarket filling station			2
an @entity6 spokesman noted : ' @entity6 is unique amongst supermarkets and oil companies by setting a maximum national price cap for its customers wherever they live – others rely on high prices at filling stations with no local competition to fund phoney price drops elsewhere			2
‘ that clear policy is what lies behind the @entity4 's confirmation that towns with an @entity6 are likely to have @entity80 ’s lowest petrol prices			1
’ the @entity4 said prices average petrol prices were still within 3p of the all - time record averaging 134.69p a litre , with diesel 140.67p			1
in may , pump prices peaked at 137.43 for petrol and 143.04 for diesel			0
@entity6 said its income tracker showed transport costs continued to be the main cost pressure on households , with @entity80 families £ 15 a week worse off than they were this time last year			0
high prices : the @entity4 said average petrol prices were still within 3p of the all - time record averaging 134.69p a litre , with diesel 140.67p			1
in may , pump prices peaked at 137.43 for petrol and 143.04 for diesel @entity101 , @entity6 ’s head of petrol trading , said : ‘ we ’re committed to doing everything we can to help lower the cost of living for our customers , and today ’s move shows that @entity6 is once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pump			2
” @entity12 's said it was not part of its ‘ strategy ’ to reveal its average prices to consumers			1
but it said : ' from tomorrow we will be cutting fuel prices in many of our stores by up to 2p per litre			0
' a @entity12 's spokesman added : ’ we are doing everything we can to help our customers save money			2
we regularly check our prices against those of competitors to ensure we always provide customers with great value			0
’ @entity127 , head of @entity129 said : ‘ we very much welcome @entity6 ’s decision to pass on savings quickly			0
' unfortunately , there are many towns in the @entity80 that do n’t have their influence and they will have to wait significantly longer for wholesale price cuts to be passed on – and probably not in their entirety			0
we hope that other retailers will take up the challenge			0
’ mr @entity127 added : ‘ a stronger pound and drop in the value of oil have created the chance to give drivers some respite from high fuel prices – but we fear that it is temporary			0
' this summer has been characterised by a series of price swings from fluctuating oil prices that reflected more the twists and turns of the euro crises than the fundamentals of supply and demand			0

supermarket giant has knocked up to 2p a litre off petrol prices in the @entity80
oil giants and @entity12 's *poised* to follow
@entity4 warns move may be short - lived and that only towns with an @entity6 will benefit
