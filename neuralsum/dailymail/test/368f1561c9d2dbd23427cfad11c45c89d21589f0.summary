@entity1 leaders have reached a bipartisan compromise on a bill that would end the @entity5 's controversial collection of @entity7 phone records , but the measure faces an uncertain future in the @entity10			1
the @entity11 on thursday overwhelmingly passed the latest version of a bill known as the @entity14 by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2			0
the measure seeks to codify president @entity18 's proposal to end the @entity5 's collection of domestic calling records			0
it would allow the agency to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations			0
the authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the @entity30 will expire june 1 unless @entity31 passes a law reauthorizing it			1
the @entity1 bill would do that , with changes			2
' it would result in phone companies , not the @entity5 , collecting so - called ' metadata ' on trillions of phone calls			2
government agencies could get access to it by applying to a judge empowered by the @entity67			0
similar legislation was introduced in the @entity10 by @entity70 @entity69 and @entity54 @entity71			2
but @entity72 senate majority leader @entity72 is seemingly out of phase , sponsoring his own bill to extend the @entity30 – unchanged – until the end of 2020			1
@entity76 said he intended his bill to be a starting point for legislative debate , not a complete solution			0
a similar bill to the one that cleared the @entity11 passed the @entity1 last year by a bipartisan vote of 303 to 121 but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the @entity10			1
the @entity11 chairman , @entity87 @entity53 rep. @entity53 , said the bill 's provisions had been carefully negotiated with both the intelligence committee and intelligence agencies			0
during the hearing , lawmakers said a deal had been reached to bring the @entity14 to the floor without going through the intelligence committee , where many republicans support continuing the @entity5 bulk collection			0
the @entity5 's collection and storage of @entity7 ' to and from ' landline calling records – times , dates and numbers , but not content of the calls – was the most controversial program among many disclosed by former @entity5 systems administrator @entity48			2
@entity106 : senate majority leader @entity72 , a @entity107 @entity72 , is trying to reauthorize the @entity30 without changes some @entity5 officials opposed the program , and independent evaluations have found it of limited value as a counterterrorism tool			1
@entity53 said the @entity1 bill would create a ' narrower , targeted program , ' that will still allow the @entity5 to hunt for connections between foreign terrorists and @entity7 residents			1
' we must act decisively to end bulk collection in the @entity7 , ' said rep. @entity56 , the ranking @entity70 , in an @entity123 interview			0
' for years , the @entity5 has collected our phone records , yet it can not point to a single attack that the collection has stopped , ' added rep. @entity55 , a @entity127 @entity72 who was one of the @entity30 's original authors			1
some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill 's civil liberties provisions , but those were voted down , with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue @entity5 phone records collection			1
a civil liberties group praised the bill			2
' the @entity14 of 2015 offers an effective path forward in reforming overbroad domestic surveillance and putting an end to the bulk collection of @entity7 ' communications , ' said @entity145 , president of the @entity146 , in a statement .			0

@entity149 would *replace* @entity30 when it expires on june 1
careful *negotiations* have brought it to a @entity1 vote but the @entity10 is still uncertain
senate majority leader @entity72 has introduced a bill that would *re-authorize* the existing @entity30 for 5 more years
civil liberties activists are upset over mass - surveillance carried out by the @entity5 and exposed by leaker @entity48
