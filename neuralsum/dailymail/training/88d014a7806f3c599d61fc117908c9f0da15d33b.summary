@entity13 terrier @entity11 was just hours from certain death after licking coolant , a very sweet product often used in radiator and brake fluids , off a garage floor near @entity20 , @entity21			1
but thanks to a quick - thinking vet at @entity26 hospital , it was recognised that the puppy had ethylene glycol poisoning			1
if untreated , the poisoning can cause kidney failure and death within a day			2
as part of the life saving procedure , 700ml of vodka was fed intravenously into @entity11 through a tube in his nose through to his stomach			1
the alcohol is able to change the chemical reaction , stop kidney failure and ultimately death			0
the @entity52 reported @entity11 's owner @entity53 said she was surprised by the effects the procedure had on her pet			2
' he was definitely drunk , ' she said			0
' he was stumbling around , @entity57 € ™ d go to pat him and heâ € ™ d push me away like a normal drunk person , he was vomiting a little , whining like a drunk			0
' lucky ! after the two - day procedure @entity11 made a full recovery to return to full health love : @entity11 pictured with his owner @entity53 after the ordeal , which nearly cost the puppy his life ' i thought it was hilarious ... it was distressing but funny at the same time			1
' but just as it does in humans , ms @entity53 suspects the puppy struggled with an almighty hangover the following day			0
' he just slept and slept and slept , ' she said			0
' i tried to take him for a walk ... but he just sat down after 50 metres ... i had to pick him up and carry him home			0
' hangover : ms @entity53 said @entity11 was not his usual self while dealing with the effects of a massive hangover in an @entity26 blog , a post confirmed @entity11 was feeling the effects of being drunk during treatment in the hospital 's intensive care unit			2
' in fact for the whole weekend , @entity11 had a huge party with us in the @entity96 , ' the post said			0
' the vodka sedated @entity11 and while undergoing therapy , we needed to monitor @entity11			0
' the hospital treats two to three cases of ethylene glycol a year , with vodka the easiest form of treatment			1
happy ending : the animal hospital where @entity11 was treated said they treat up to three ethylene glycol poisoning a year			1
