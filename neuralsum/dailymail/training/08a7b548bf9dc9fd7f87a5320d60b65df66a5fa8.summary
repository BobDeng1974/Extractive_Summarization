by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 08:06 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 19:41 est , 30 october 2012 two more @entity4 soldiers were killed yesterday by a rogue @entity6 policeman			1
their deaths prompted a former government minister to call for @entity4 troops to leave @entity6 by @entity10			2
the shooting of the troops - from the @entity13 - by an @entity6 they believed to be on their side takes the number of @entity4 servicemen and women killed in so - called ' green on blue ' insider attacks to 11			1
partnership : @entity4 soldiers helping to re-establish government control in an area of @entity24 province the figure represents a quarter of all @entity4 forces to die in the conflict this year			2
@entity30 ’s former @entity29 minister @entity28 urged the prime minister to bring the entire 9,500 - strong @entity4 force home by @entity10 , rather than wait until the end of 2014 for the scheduled final withdrawal			0
conservative mp @entity36 , who commanded @entity38 troops in @entity39 , said ‘ green on blue ’ incidents had reached ‘ enormous proportions ’ and the @entity6 authorities ’ efforts to vet recruits to root out insurgents was ‘ clearly not working ’			1
he told the @entity47 : ‘ enough is enough			0
this has gone on too long			0
we should get our troops out as fast as possible			0
‘ it ’s not as easy to pull stumps as some people suggest , but we should get them out as fast as possible			0
’ however , defence chiefs have insisted the drawdown process should not be derailed by ‘ insider attacks ’			1
yesterday ’s deaths at a checkpoint in the @entity62 - e - @entity61 area of @entity24 took the number of @entity65 ’s @entity64 to die this year alone in attacks by @entity6 wearing police or army uniforms to 56			1
both soldiers were from 1st @entity13 and were killed in the @entity61 district of @entity24			2
a spokesman for @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ' i am saddened to report the deaths of two soldiers from 1st @entity13 who were shot and killed by a man wearing an @entity6 police uniform at a checkpoint in the @entity82 - e @entity61 district of @entity24			1
' the loss of these soldiers is a huge blow to the @entity13 and everyone serving in @entity72			0
our thoughts are with their families , friends and fellow @entity91 at this time			0
' the soldiers next of kin have been informed			0
an @entity6 police official in the southern province of @entity24 said efforts were underway to apprehend the policeman involved			2
so - called insider attacks on @entity100 forces have undermined trust between coalition and @entity6 forces as @entity65 prepares to withdraw most combat troops by the end of 2014			1
@entity106 : international troops have been working with @entity6 soldiers in the region just last week two @entity110 and one @entity112 soldier were shot and killed by a man in an @entity6 police uniform			1
the attacks come despite the @entity6 government launching a large - scale push to re-screen thousands of security forces , trying to identify infiltrators or those who might not be considered secure			1
the @entity121 have said they are using the attacks as a specific strategy to drive a wedge between the international coalition and the @entity6			1
last wednesday , the leader of the @entity6 @entity121 , mullah @entity127 , released a statement saying insurgents would increase the number of insider attacks against coalition and @entity6 forces			1
in an emailed statement congratulating @entity135 as they prepare to celebrate the @entity137 holiday , mullah @entity127 urged ' every brave @entity6 in the ranks of the foreign forces and their @entity6 hirelings ... to strike them			1
' ' jihadist activities inside the circle of the state militias are the most effective stratagem			0
its dimension will see further expansion , organization and efficiency , ' he said			0
' increase your efforts to expand the area of infiltration in the ranks of the enemy			0
the killings have stretched to the breaking point a partnership that @entity110 and @entity65 officials consider a key part their exit plan - preparing the @entity6 to take over responsibility for their country ’s security in just over two years ’ time			1
the program , where @entity6 and international troops are supposed to work ' shoulder to shoulder , ' is now being re-evaluated			1
last week it was revealed two @entity4 soldiers shot dead in @entity6 may have been the victims of a revenge attack by local police			2
former attack : corporal @entity176 ( left ) , 25 , and corporal @entity177 ( right ) , 27 , are believed to have been shot dead by an @entity6 policeman operation : a @entity4 army officer from 1st @entity181 in @entity24 earlier this year the growing trend of so - called ' green - on - blue ' attacks in @entity6 is becoming of increasing concern after a surge in numbers this year			1
officially , nine @entity4 troops have died at the hands of @entity6 colleagues so far this year			2
that figure does not include today 's deaths , also believed to be ' insider attacks ' , as well as the deaths of @entity195 medic corporal @entity176 and @entity197 corporal @entity177 last week , which are still being investigated			2
the growing number of @entity4 troops killed by @entity6 colleagues this year compares to just one such death in 2011 , prompting calls for a faster withdrawal of @entity4 's armed forces in @entity6			1
the planned draw - down will see the withdrawal of combat troops in the country by the end of 2014			2
conservative mp @entity36 , who commanded @entity38 troops in @entity39 as an army colonel , said last month that green - on - blue incidents had reached ' enormous proportions ' and the @entity6 authorities ' efforts to vet recruits to root out insurgents was ' clearly not working '			1
he told the @entity47 : ' enough is enough			0
this has gone on too long			0
we should get our troops out as fast as possible			0
it 's not as easy to pull stumps as some people suggest , but we should get them out as fast as possible			0
' @entity30 's former @entity29 minister @entity28 also urged the prime minister to bring the entire 9,500 - strong force home by @entity10 , rather than waiting until the end of 2014 for final @entity234 earlier this month , relatives marking the 11th anniversary of the start of the war echoed that demand			0
but defence chiefs have insisted the draw - down process should not be derailed by ' insider attacks '			1
speaking last week , mr @entity239 said : ' we are pulling out of @entity6			2
we have a plan to end our combat role by the end of 2014 , to draw down significantly during the course of next year but on the way to continue our task of training , mentoring the @entity6 so that they can take over the security role			2
' overall the security picture across @entity6 is steadily improving , i am confident about that , but this is not suburban @entity252 and it never will be			2
' and brigadier @entity254 , the outgoing commander of @entity72 , said although the number of green - on - blue attacks rose during his six - month tour , it did not dent soldiers ' resolve			1
' we suffered three incidents on our tour which left seven of our soldiers killed , ' he said			2
' numerically , the insider threat did go up on our tour			0
we knew that within the brigade			0
of all the casualties we have suffered these are without a shadow of a doubt the hardest to bear			0
' but he said the issue was with ' individuals not institutions ' , adding : ' the green - on - blue element of the insider threat is a risk and it does add to the pressure but it is just one of many risks that our soldiers face every day			1
' i visited all of our teams throughout the tour and their sense of commitment and belief in what they were doing was simply very , very strong			0
' i visited the teams after they had lost soldiers due to insider attacks , all of them still had absolutely firm belief in the task they were doing and were back on the job within 48 hours			1
' corporal @entity176 , 25 , of @entity297 and corporal @entity298 , 27 , of @entity299 , @entity197 , were previously thought to have been caught up in a so - called ‘ friendly fire ’ incident			0
but after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition , @entity303 investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by @entity309			0
a @entity311 spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘ a third party ... not @entity4 personnel ’			0
and defence secretary @entity239 – asked whether the @entity4 personnel had been killed in a ‘ green on blue ’ attack , when @entity6 personnel turn on their @entity4 partners – said : ‘ there is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is not clear at this stage			1

killings are latest in a rash of ' green - on - blue ' attacks , in which @entity6 security forces turn their weapons on foreign troops
56 international troops have already been killed in insider attacks by @entity6 soldiers or police so far this year
