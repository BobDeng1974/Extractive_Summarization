@entity0 were denied a rare win on @entity3 soil by a saved penalty and the upright as the under - 19s were held to 1 - 1 draw against their bitter rivals			1
not since the senior side beat @entity10 2 - 1 in a 2008 friendly , with @entity12 's late header , have @entity0 or any of the sides at youth level won here , but the @entity16 came within a whisker			2
goals from @entity0 striker @entity20 and @entity10 's @entity21 either side of half time eventually decided this tie at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
jumping for joy : @entity20 celebrates scoring the opener for @entity0 but it was n't enough not so high : @entity20 ca n't quite believe it after missing a penalty while one of the @entity3 celebrates @entity10 under - 19s : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity21			1
@entity0 under - 19s : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity20 , @entity50 , @entity51			1
the game was tight and anxious until @entity53 's @entity20 broke the deadlock with a well - taken goal on 37 minutes			2
@entity56 was busy and bustling in the middle of the park and his pressure paid off when he pinched the ball from @entity37 and passed to @entity20 on the edge of the box			1
the teenager took a touch around centre - back @entity35 and sent a low shot under @entity67 from eight yards			2
but @entity10 struck back in the 59th minute with a well - worked goal			0
@entity69 found @entity70 on the right in , from @entity0 's point of view , too much space and he sent in a low cross which @entity21 slid in			1
from there , the match completely opened up			0
@entity78 left - back @entity77 struck the right post on 64 minutes after twisting and turning two defenders inside out before curling an effort across goal			0
when the ball came back off the upright , @entity49 followed up with a low shot but it was saved by @entity10 goalkeeper @entity67			1
@entity0 won a penalty two minutes later when goal - scorer @entity20 was clattered in the box by @entity90 , but he stepped up to take it and his effort was saved by @entity32 , diving low to his left			1
combative : @entity10 's @entity39 tries to break away from @entity0 's @entity44 to launch an attack @entity95 and tumble : @entity44 and @entity97 get the better of @entity39 on this occasion straight up the other end , @entity10 broke and @entity39 struck a powerful drive which @entity0 goalkeeper @entity42 , son of @entity101 and @entity103 stopper @entity102 , could only beat out			1
but @entity0 were dangerous on the break , too			0
in the 79th minute @entity105 passed from his own half to @entity107 on the right then charged forward			0
@entity107 played him in with the return pass and @entity111 's low shot across goal flew agonisingly wide			1
then , on 86 minutes , centre - half @entity97 , who moved from @entity114 to @entity115 in the summer , tore forward from the back			2
he ran on to @entity118 's high ball , in behind the defence , and went for a flick over the on - rushing goalkeeper but the move required the subtler finish of a forward and the ball dropped over the bar			0
line - up : @entity0 's young lions pose for a photo before their 1 - 1 draw with @entity10 in @entity24 @entity132 target @entity49 , 18 , was immense in the centre of the park			1
scouts from top - flight clubs have followed him closely at @entity114 over the past 18 months and manager @entity138 suggested recently he is one of the most talented teenagers @entity0 have ever produced			0
@entity140 winger @entity51 ghosted past the @entity3 players for fun and had the opposition constantly on the back foot running scared			2
@entity51 , 17 , has tried to style his game on @entity146 – there 's no harm in aiming at the top – and his low centre of gravity enables him to shimmy and shift the ball around and through players as if they were n't there			2
in the first half the 5ft 5ins player was a much - used outlet on the left - hand side to build @entity0 's attacks			2
it was just a shame that one of those did not turn in to a second goal			0
@entity165 , in charge of the side before handing over to new manager @entity168 , said : ' there are bits we can work on without a doubt but i 'm very pleased with them			0
they 're a great group , they listen intently , they work hard , they put a shift in			0
' the result did n't quite come off , but the performance was key and we said that from the very beginning			0
produce a performance and you 'll be fine			0
' the message we give to the players now : go back to your clubs , get back into your club environment , keep working hard and doing the things which got you here in the first place			0
' touch of class : @entity50 keeps the ball away from @entity192 as @entity0 searched for the win class act : @entity0 's @entity56 sweeps the ball away despite the attentions of three @entity3 markers			1

@entity20 put @entity0 into a first half lead with a low strike
@entity132 target @entity56 had played him in to put @entity0 ahead
@entity21 slid in @entity70 's low cross to equalise
@entity20 was brought down in the box to win @entity0 a late penalty
he *dusted* himself down but saw his shot saved by @entity67
@entity0 looked solid but could not secure a win on @entity3 soil
@entity51 , @entity49 and @entity97 all shone for the young lions
