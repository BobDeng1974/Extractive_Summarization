by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 4 october 2012 two men who escaped with their lives when their twin - engine plane burst into flames and took a nose dive into the @entity6 , have not only lived to tell the tale of the harrowing ordeal but remarkably managed to document their survival with an @entity11 camera			1
as pilot @entity12 , 37 and his best friend , @entity13 , took off from @entity14 , @entity15 in a tiny @entity17 aircraft on september 20th , they were looking forward to a smooth journey to @entity19 , @entity20			1
but when after two hours the cockpit began filling with smoke , a high - risk emergency landing on water quickly looked inevitable for the two men			1
talking to the @entity43 about their incredibly story , mr @entity12 recalled the moment disaster struck along a route her had flown many times			1
safe : back on dry land , the pilot ( left ) and his passenger ( right ) told the @entity43 how the cockpit began to fill up with smoke and before they could finish their sos call they were covered in flames ' we were flying along , i 'm eating a bag of @entity61 , i check in with @entity63 centre , ' he said			1
' and then we see a little bit of smoke which typically is not a huge deal - usually a radio will smoke a little so you throw the electrical power off , everything 's fine			2
' i made a quick radio call to @entity63 centre , told them we have a problem			2
before i finished the radio call , we were just covered , covered in smoke			2
' a pilot since he was just 15 years old , mr @entity12 and his well - travelled friend immediately sprang into action , deciding together what steps they should take - the kind of cooperation , says mr @entity13 , that ultimately saved them from the clutches of death			1
vessel : @entity88 's @entity17 twin - engine plane before it plummeted 11,000 feet into the @entity6 and sank 30 miles off the coast of @entity37 @entity90 : the journey from @entity14 , @entity15 to @entity19 , @entity20 was a familiar one to mr @entity12 who has been flying since he was 15 years old ' there was no praying , there was no thinking the world was coming to an end , ' he said			1
' that 's pretty much what saved our lives			2
being able to recognise the aircraft 's loss , now it 's just save ourselves			0
' mr @entity12 credited their astonishing ability to remain so calm and focussed on the problem , to training			1
' you kind of go onto autopilot in these situations , no pun intended , ' he joked from the comfort and safety of @entity114 's studio sofa			0
indeed coastguards have called their emergency landing and the way they handled the terrifying ordeal as ' textbook ' , but what happened next was perhaps a little more improvisational and off - text than a traditional emergency plan might advise			2
on impact , as the plane began to sink quickly and the men realised they had no time to waste in ejecting themselves from the cockpit , mr @entity123 grabbed an @entity11 that was concealed in a water resistant protective case and plunged into the open sea			1
saved ! after three hours floating adrift on the ocean , as the two men began to worry about the night ahead , they were spotted and airlifted to safety by a coastguard stoic : mr @entity13 ( left ) and mr @entity12 ( right ) kept calm throughout the ordeal comforted by the fact that they had set off an emergency beacon and rescue services should have been able to find them remarkably undamaged , the @entity11 camera was used by mr @entity12 and mr @entity123 to record moment - by - moment the events that followed their crash - landing for posterity , unsure of what fate would hold for them			1
the first clip was filmed within an hour of landing			0
with no sign of the coast guard or rescue emergency services , they calmly informed an audience : ' we did have a sport fisher on the horizon			1
we tried to flag him down			0
we tried to signal him without any luck			0
' what has inspired and amazed the public about the story is the unbelievable lack of panic or hysteria exhibited throughout the ordeal			0
' people ask us " were you worried ? " we were n't worried at all , ' explained mr @entity12 in @entity171			1
' we knew there were three positioning devices that coud find us			2
' ' but when the first aircraft passed over our heads and did n't see us and we 're waving and waving			0
and they still do n't see us			0
and the second aircraft shows up , they do n't see us ? yes , we started to get nervous			0
' modern rescue : the @entity11 filmed the two men as they tried to flag down a sport fisher and two planes to no avail and hope began to wane slowly yet with no hint of lost hope or melodrama , the pragmatic pilot spoke a final time into the @entity192 device			1
' hopefully this is the last recording because we will be rescued soon			2
signing off , ' he said before switching the @entity11 off			0
luckily , their metaphorical prayers were answered and just before night fell , the two men were spotted and airlifted to safety by a coast guard			1
all involved knew that a night time rescue would have been next to impossible			0
back on dry land and carrying his arm in a sling , mr @entity13 announced confidently to the @entity43 : ' i have no hesitation whatsoever of climbing into another aircraft again			1
my wife on the hand ... does not want me to do much			0
' experienced : mr @entity12 credited their survival to training and an ability to remain calm while focussing on the emergency at hand while his friend said working together was vital and while his pilot friend allowed himself to admit that it was ' pretty scary , ' he also informed viewers that he already has another plane and will continue his work to support the program around the @entity221 that gives aeroplane rides to kids to cancer			1
' nothing has changed , except the tail number , ' he laughed			0
asked a final time whether at any point they feared the worst , mr @entity13 elaborated : ' @entity230 definitely plays a role			2
i wo n't lie and say i did n't have any fear ... however because of experience and because we 've been in stressful situations , we were both remaining calm and you begin looking at your options , even though they 're very bleak and grim out there in the middle of nowhere			0
' we did spot an oil rig just out on the horizon			0
it becomes one of those things of , " okay if it gets dark and they leave what are we going to do ? " so there was some fear involved but it was n't enough to overpower our patience			0

@entity12 and @entity13 were flying from @entity14 , @entity15 to @entity19 , @entity20 when the plane began smoking after two hours
the twin - engine plane plummeted 11,000 feet into the sea and sank 30 miles off the @entity37 coast
men *relied* on flotation devices for three hours before being rescued by coast guard *helicopter*
