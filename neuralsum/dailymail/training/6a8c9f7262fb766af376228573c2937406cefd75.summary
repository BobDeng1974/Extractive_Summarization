i know why he was angry , and that will come out			0
' neither woman elaborated about the ' real ' reason behind the beating			0
brutality : miss @entity7 was hospitalized for several days after the attack , receiving treatment for a broken nose in the beating that was so bad her eyes were swollen shut happy couple : @entity7 and @entity12 have remained together , despite the violent end to @entity10 dinner @entity12 was arrested on sunday and charged with second - degree assault , and later released on bond			1
family and supporters of miss @entity7 believe those charges should be much more severe			1

@entity121 : miss @entity7 suffered numerous lacerations and required facial reconstruction surgery after the attack and @entity15 is not alone , as 26 other states are also without hate crime laws protecting members of the lgbt community , including @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			1
