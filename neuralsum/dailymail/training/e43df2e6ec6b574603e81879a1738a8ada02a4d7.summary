by @entity1 reporter published : 15:33 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 15:47 est , 9 january 2014 fire starter : @entity4 holding @entity5 who chewed through a can of deodorant which caused an explosion a six - month - old puppy chomped through a can of deodorant which caused a window - shattering explosion			1
the saluki greyhound cross called @entity5 chewed through the can of @entity16 and caused a blast so intense that it shattered his owner 's double glazed bay window , broke the floorboards and set fire to the sofa			1
@entity24 , 20 , and her partner @entity4 , 22 , said they were lucky not to have been in during the freak accident at their home in @entity30 , @entity31 , on saturday			1
firefighters first told the couple that the explosion must have been caused by leaking gas pipes			0
but after no evidence of a leak was found , they now believe that @entity5 chewed through the deodorant can right next to the home 's back boiler , located directly behind the living room fire			2
when the central heating came on just minutes later , a spark ignited the gas and caused the explosion			0
mr @entity4 , who is currently unemployed , said : ' i did n't even know we had a can of @entity16 in the living room			1
' it was a @entity51 present from @entity24 's parents and was in a gift box underneath a table - right next to the fire and back boiler			2
' it is just one of those awful coincidences i suppose - moments after @entity5 chewed through the can , the back boiler must have ignited			2
' poor old @entity5 is lucky he did n't chew that can a few minutes later or he 'd probably be dead now			0
' miss @entity24 said : ' we had only left the house 10 minutes before the explosion			1
naughty : @entity5 the puppy lies on the sofa at his home in @entity30 , @entity31 the blast was so intense it shattered a bay window , broke floorboards and set fire to the sofa ' but while we were out we received text from our neighbour saying our house had blown up , then we were told the living room window had blown out			1
' i was panicking about our pets so we rushed back			0
when we got there we saw flashing lights , two fire engines outside the house , the street was blocked off and there were so many people on the street having a look what was going off			0
' we thought someone had put something through the letterbox or there had been a gas explosion			0
' mr @entity4 added : ' when we got inside the house we saw that the explosion had completely smashed out our bay window			1
picture shows glass which was blown out of the window at the front of the home in @entity31 devastation : @entity24 and @entity104 outside their home in @entity30 , @entity31 ' it had also cracked the fireplace , all the floorboards underneath the explosion had been destroyed , and the sofa is completely ruined - we have had to buy a new one			1
' all i could think about was our pets - thankfully they were okay			0
' the damage caused by the explosion is estimated to be around Â£ 2,000			0
the couple 's three dogs , @entity5 , a two - year - old saluki collie whippet called @entity120 and a 15 - month old saluki collie greyhound called @entity122 as well as three cats - @entity123 , @entity125 and @entity126 , were in the house but escaped unharmed .			2
