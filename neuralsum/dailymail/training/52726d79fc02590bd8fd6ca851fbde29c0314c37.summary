@entity8 , tax commissioner at @entity10 , told the @entity11 they had no projections for how much would be collected if the revenues of major companies that have faced accusations of tax avoidance were included			1
the ‘ tax gap ’ of £ 35bn owed to the @entity17 through evasion , avoidance and fraud was revealed this month			1
bosses from @entity10 , including @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( right ) , were yesterday questioned by the public accounts committee over corporation tax however @entity27 , chairman of the commons spending watchdog , said it does not include the millions of tax which some argue firms like @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 should pay in the @entity36			1
grilling senior @entity10 officials in @entity38 yesterday , she said : ‘ it does not include a lot of what ordinary punters in the street think you should be collecting , particularly in regard to the large corporations			1
‘ the tax gap is really the tip of the iceberg in the gap between the money that you collect and the money if everyone paid their fair share , ’ the public accounts committee chairman said			1
ms @entity27 named @entity34 , @entity59 , @entity35 and @entity33 as companies whose tax affairs had sparked public anger and doubts about whether they were paying their fair share in @entity36			2
she said : ‘ it looks to me that you should be litigating			0
why have you not chosen to litigate and test your powers ? ‘ why have you not litigated against one single internet company ? ’ she added : ‘ make a few cases , a few show cases			1
it ’s so bloody obvious			0
’ @entity27 ( left ) , chairwoman of the committee , said it was ' bloody obvious ' that @entity10 should mount legal test cases against multi-national companies @entity77 mp @entity76 said @entity10 ‘ hounds ’ individuals and small firms over small tax bills but takes a ‘ supine attitude ’ to global firms			1
however , @entity22 , director of general business tax , repeatedly refused to comment on individual cases			2
he would only say : ‘ what we have to look for is : is there evidence that the offshore operation does nothing more than rubberstamp			0
’ @entity8 , @entity93 , added : ‘ we make sure we collect the tax due under the law			2
’ @entity96 , who worked for @entity34 from 2002 until 2006 , contacted the pac earlier this year with claims @entity34 has a system in place which diverts @entity36 profits through @entity101 to the @entity103 tax haven and accused the company of ' cheating ' the @entity36 taxpayer			2
@entity22 ( centre ) refused to comment on individual cases while @entity8 ( right ) said that ' collect the tax due under the law ' @entity34 assert that all its sales are made in low - tax @entity101 , rather than the @entity36 , where corporation tax is just 12.5 per cent compared to 23 per cent in @entity36			2
ms @entity27 said his details had been passed to @entity10 , who had spoken to mr @entity96 but no action had been taken			0
she demanded to be given a ‘ back of the envelope ’ figure for how much more tax would be raised if global firms were challenged , but the inspectors said it was not possible			1
when @entity10 had been challenged by mps about the tax gap before they described it as a ‘ health check ’ on their performance			1
ms @entity27 added : ‘ it has now gone up			0
does that mean @entity10 is actually chronically , institutionally incapable of really collecting tax in the way that it should ? ‘ you say you are doing better and better and if you look at the money it is 0.2 per cent more			1
‘ in real terms you got less in tax in 2011 - 12 than you did in 2010 - 11			0
it should have gone up quite a lot			0
’ in january @entity137 told the @entity139 summit in @entity140 : ‘ businesses who think they can carry on dodging that fair share , or that they can keep on selling to the @entity36 and setting up ever more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bills right down , well they need to wake up and smell the coffee , because the public who buy from them have had enough			0
