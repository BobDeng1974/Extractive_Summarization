by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the @entity1 have scored an own goal in their anti-discrimination campaign by discriminating against their own inclusion advisory board			1
minutes published ahead of the last council meeting revealed that inclusion chairman @entity6 asked for her board to be given @entity9 vip hospitality before matches			2
yet despite anti-discrimination measures supposedly being a priority for the @entity1 , the protocol committee ruled that the inclusion directors should only be invited to the @entity15 , one of the least important fixtures			1
snubbed : @entity1 made an error in snubbing @entity6 lord @entity19 , chair of @entity20 , called the decision ‘ too stupid for words ’ and a member of the inclusion board said : ‘ it beggars belief			1
there are only seven of us and the @entity31 area has room for 400			2
you wonder what goes through the minds of these people , but it ’s certainly not fighting injustices of all kinds			2
’ this snub came before @entity6 ’ committee had made clear to the @entity1 board how concerned they were about @entity1 referees ’ chief @entity43 escaping proper punishment for making a racist comment			1
yet , @entity47 and chosen guests are regulars in the @entity9 suite for every match			2
an @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ all independent committees of this type are treated the same			1
’ there is plenty of angst among those campaigning for @entity57 to return proper funding to basketball that minister of sport @entity60 has not spoken out on the subject			1
basketball , despite failing @entity57 ’s zero tolerance over olympic medal potential , is a hugely popular team sport with a diverse following and @entity68 was expected to embrace the cause			1
but , despite a number of requests , her public support has not materialised			2
ironically , @entity68 has also been criticised on @entity75 blog site @entity74 for pursuing tokenism targets but remaining silent on @entity79 ’s @entity78 debacle — despite travelling to @entity80 on an official trip			0
advocate : basketball star @entity83 played for @entity84 at @entity85 the @entity1 ’s ludicrous protocol committee showed once again that they care more about having their faces in the trough than anything else			1
@entity1 minutes report that before the @entity92 final between @entity93 and @entity94 ‘ lunch commenced slightly later than scheduled ’			1
no wonder @entity1 chairman @entity95 wants root and branch reform of the ‘ increasingly irrelevant ’ council body			1
it was noticeable at the @entity100 yesterday how little time @entity102 chairman and @entity104 benefactor @entity101 spent with @entity106 chairman @entity105 despite a strong desire to host an @entity100 in 2019			0
@entity101 has a dislike for @entity105 , preferring even to host lunch with the awful @entity110 instead			0
@entity111 ‘ no ’ to @entity113 role lord @entity111 is putting his beloved track and field before @entity116 wishes that he becomes the next chairman of the @entity118			1
@entity111 , pm @entity119 ’s preferred candidate , did apply for the top @entity113 post but has decided to withdraw before the interview stage as he wants to prioritise his bid to succeed @entity123 as president of the @entity125 in august 2015			2
no : lord @entity111 will not take a role at the @entity118 @entity111 , in @entity133 to watch the @entity134 , said : ‘ i did allow my name to go forward to give myself time to properly analyse whether i had enough time to do the job to the best of my abilities			1
on reflection , i have n’t the capacity and i now want to concentrate on my current commitments and the @entity125 election			0
as everyone knows athletics is in my dna			0
’ royal brothers prince @entity141 and @entity143 failed to make much of an impression on the @entity134			0
the live @entity113 feed of the squash online name - checked prince @entity141 when the camera panned on to @entity143 and his family yesterday			0
when @entity143 arrived at the weightlifting on sunday , the @entity151 announcer welcomed prince @entity141			0
there is optimism that a @entity156 meeting in 2015 can take place in @entity159 ’s @entity158 next summer after a new roof has been installed			0
the running track has been buried under nearly a metre of gravel during the major building works			0
inspections show it has survived unscathed , although whether it is still suitable for top competition will not become clear until it is fully uncovered next @entity170			0
watching on : prince @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity143 at the @entity134			0

@entity1 score own goal in anti-discrimination campaign by discriminating against their own people
angst among those hoping for @entity57 funding to return for basketball
lord @entity111 says no to role at the head of the @entity118
