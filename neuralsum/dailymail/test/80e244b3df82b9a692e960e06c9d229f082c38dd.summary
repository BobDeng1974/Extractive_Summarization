it was the sort of training ground accident that can happen to anyone , but it had far - reaching consequences for @entity4			1
so too , indirectly , for @entity5			2
@entity4 's tackle on a team - mate at @entity9 's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough , until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble			1
as players milled round him , and a physio inspected the damage , the call went out for expert medical help			0
to the dismay of @entity26 , there was n't a single qualified doctor on site			1
@entity9 doctor @entity5 quit this week after a reported rift with @entity26 the pair fell out over an injury to @entity4 during training as early as november last year as @entity4 lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle , the physio tended to him as best he could , while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , was at his city centre clinic , nearly eight miles away			2
it was last november , and from that day on , the 72 - year - old 's days as head of @entity9 's medical department were numbered			1
they finally ended after @entity9 's @entity45 defeat at @entity46 , when @entity26 went public with his displeasure over recovery rates for injured players by blaming a lengthening injury list for his side 's quarter - final first - leg demise			1
it was more than the world - renowned specialist could stomach , and he promptly walked away from the @entity58 champions for a second time , taking the rest of his staff with him			2
he quit in high dudgeon once before , after a fall - out with @entity64 , but there will be no coming back this time			2
not as long as @entity26 holds the reins			1
and that may just be for quite a while yet			0
the @entity9 boss is aware @entity70 long to install him as replacement for @entity73 , even if it means waiting another 12 months for his contract to expire , but the latest ructions at the @entity77 have evidently done nothing to increase their chances			1
@entity9 doctor @entity5 is a world - renowned specialist and quit after @entity26 's injury complaints the 72 - year - old had been at @entity9 for almost 40 years but is now unlikely to return to the @entity58 club unseemly though his undermining of @entity5 may have been , there was only ever going to be one winner			1
and , by all accounts , when his hand was raised in triumph , it strengthened his hold on power like never before			0
dispiritingly for @entity70 , the former @entity95 manager reaffirmed , at his friday press conference , that he will ' for sure ' honour the remaining year on his contract , ruling out any hope of a deal being struck with @entity100 bosses this summer			1
beyond that , he could even commit himself to a further spell in charge , according to a @entity9 insider , who told @entity105 : ' there is no question that @entity9 will do absolutely everything in their power to persuade @entity26 to sign another contract			1
' there will be negotiations after the season is finished , and there is an air of confidence within the club that he will agree			0
it is far from certain , but , interestingly , the departure of @entity5 makes it more probable , rather than less so			2
@entity5 ( fourth from left ) sits behind @entity26 during the defeat by @entity46 this week @entity70 long to bring in @entity122 to replace @entity73 but they may have to wait for him ' that was a problem , because they had many disagreements over the treatment of injured players			1
now he has gone , @entity26 is in a stronger position than ever			0
that is clear , because when @entity5 said he was leaving , the club made no attempt to talk him out of it			0
they simply accepted it and said thanks very much			0
' @entity26 has got his own way again , and that could play a part when they sit down in the summer to discuss a new deal			2
' so what went wrong between them ? how could it be that a vastly - experienced and hugely - respected surgeon with a track record for rescuing stellar careers imperilled by injury failed to meet @entity26 's requirements as club doctor ? certainly , availability was a major issue			2
@entity105 has learned that one of @entity26 's stipulations , after taking over from @entity154 , was that the club doctor should be at the training ground every single time the players were there			1
@entity159 , @entity160 , @entity4 and @entity161 ( @entity162 ) trudge off the pitch after defeat in @entity46 @entity5 has worked with the @entity166 national team as well as athletes including @entity168 @entity5 has often courted controversy with his methods			1
he claims that a substance called @entity172 , which is extracted from the crest of cockerels , helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain			0
he also swears by @entity177 , an amino acid preparation derived from calves ' blood			0
in 2009 , he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat 's blood to @entity185 striker @entity184 for his hamstring injury			0
among those to have been treated by him are @entity188 , @entity168 , @entity189 and @entity190			0
@entity5 claims to have administered more than one million injections , at least half of which have been to athletes			0
a stickler for detail , he wanted to ensure any mishap could be dealt with expertly at a moment 's notice and made it clear it was an instruction to be adhered to by @entity5			0
it placed club bosses in a quandary , not for the last time , as @entity5 pointed out he had a steady stream of high - profile patients to his city centre practice , not least the likes of @entity168 , and that he could ill - afford to desert his post to spend day after day at the club 's training facility			2
irked by @entity5 's defiance , it soon became apparent to @entity26 that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury			1
in a nutshell , @entity26 wanted players declared fit and pencilled in for selection as rapidly as possible , whereas care and caution were the key words for @entity5			1
it drove @entity26 to distraction , according to the club insider , who said : ' @entity26 has never been the most patient about players ' recovery time			2
if there is an injury , he expects it to clear up			0
he wants the players back on the pitch , but it was n't happening			0
' @entity5 is the opposite			0
he takes the view that you have to be patient and allow the healing process to take its course			0
he wants a player to be in perfect condition when he returns and argues that rushing people back runs the risk of a fresh injury			0
really , it 's no wonder they were at loggerheads			0
' @entity26 wanted players declared fit as rapidly as possible , but @entity5 wanted care and caution @entity5 prescribed a course of action for a nagging injury to @entity253 but was overruled			1
as a further insight into the core differences between the pair , @entity5 prescribed a specific course of action for a nagging injury to @entity253 but was overruled			2
the midfielder suffered damage to the same area of his knee three times in quick succession , and @entity5 was adamant he should attend the veteran medic 's clinic in @entity268 for specialised treatment			2
@entity26 was having none of it and , instead , arranged for @entity253 to undergo treatment in @entity95 , where , to @entity5 's exasperation , surgery was followed by recuperation and an eventual return to the @entity9 squad			1
@entity168 was one of many athletes to benefit from @entity5 's treatment at the @entity280 @entity26 is now in the strongest position he has ever been at @entity9 and he could agree a new deal there if protesting to the @entity9 boss was futile , trying to appeal to @entity253 was just as pointless			1
his agent is none other than @entity26 's brother , @entity287			0
the odds were stacked ever - higher against @entity5 , and his resignation on friday morning was merely confirmation the @entity26 empire is not about to be overthrown			1
city must now wait to see if the @entity294 's @entity293 rule is about to be extended , as forecast with growing confidence in @entity297 circles .			0

@entity9 doctor @entity5 quit this week
his resignation came after @entity26 blamed defeat by @entity46 on injuries
the pair fell out as early as november over the treatment of @entity4
@entity26 now has even more power and could stay at @entity9 for a long time
@entity70 want to bring him in as manager but he is unlikely to leave
@entity26 , who is *impatient* with injuries , could even agree a new deal
former @entity95 boss has denied a rift with his medical staff this week
