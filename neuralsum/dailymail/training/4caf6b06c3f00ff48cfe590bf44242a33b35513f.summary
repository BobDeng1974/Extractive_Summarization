by @entity0 published : 07:32 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 11:38 est , 3 march 2014 walking the dog can be a test of endurance at the best of times			2
but @entity6 and @entity7 face an even greater daily challenge taking out their beloved pet - a @entity12 raccoon			1
the pair , from @entity14 , @entity15 , can barely move for the endless interest their unusual companion provokes from those with more ordinary animals			1
the couple , who used to run a pet shop together , live apart , but @entity6 often brings @entity24 round to play with their 20 other pets , including a skunk , an owl and a monkey			1
mrs @entity7 , 48 , said : ' she 's a bit like a dog - she needs to be walked , although we never get very far because we get stopped all the time			1
' we get some funny looks and a lot of people ask what on earth is she but normally people think she 's really cute			1
' she 's a bit nervous of strangers but we take her for walks to socialise			1
' we took her to @entity54 once and tried to take her to the beach but we could n't get near the sea because she was stopped by so many people			2
menagerie : @entity24 is the latest addition to the 20 - pet collection that @entity26 and mrs @entity7 keep between them ' very loving ' : mrs @entity7 told how @entity24 is affectionate to her owners but nervous when out in public ' some people think she 's a dog and others say they want a raccoon of their own but i tell them owning one is hard work			1
' it 's like having a baby who 's just learning to walk			1
you ca n't leave ornaments out because she 'll knock them all over			0
she loves shiny things and is very tactile			0
' she 's very loving and she likes sitting on your knee and having her tummy tickled			1
' mrs @entity7 , who has three children to care for as well as the miniature menagerie , added : ' she eats mainly dog food , although she has fruit and veg too			1
' she loves chocolate and if she smells it we have to run in to another room			0
we give her some chocolate as a special treat , but not too often because it 's not good for her			2
' she loves playing with my @entity89 and they just run around and play with each other which is good because they both burn off a lot of energy			0
' raccoons are very intelligent animals and she 's very clever			2
she can get into everything , jam jars , drawers			0
popular : @entity24 draws comment from passers - by wherever she goes enterprising : the pair told how @entity24 can hunts around for food if left unwatched , and can even open jars herself ' you have to have eyes in the back of your head , or she 'll be going through your pockets			1
if you have money in your pocket she 'll put her hand in and take it			0
' she squeaks , barks , purrs , makes all sort of noises			0
' mr and mrs @entity7 now jointly run a party firm - called @entity119 - where they bring their exotic animals to birthday parties and corporate events			1
mrs @entity7 lives with 20 pets including a skunk called @entity127 , an owl called @entity129 , a monkey called @entity131 and a tortoise called @entity133			1
the collection also includes bearded dragons , geckos , a tarantula , @entity89 the @entity89 and three cats			2
urban dweller : raccoons have thrived in cities across the @entity142 and @entity143 raccoons are on average 24 to 38 inches long , and can weigh as much as 23lbs			0
in the wild the mammals only live for around three years , but can survive until 20 in captivity			2
some experts think the dark â € ˜ maskâ € ™ which covers their eyes may reduce glare from the sun and help them to see at night			0
their five - fingered paw has been likened to a human hand and , as @entity7 attests , makes them very capable of getting round the house and into unexpected places			1
raccoons are considered pests in their native @entity142 , and states with large populations have issued advice on how to keep them out of properties			0
in urban environments , much like foxes , they can take to rooting through rubbish bags for food			0
raccoons can eat almost anything , though their main diet tends to be insects and plantlife			0
the first written record of the raccoon comes in a journal entry from pioneer @entity176			2
the species is especially fond of water and swimming , thought it can run as fast as 15 miles per hour on ground			0
raccoons are thought to be intelligent animals , and studies have shown they can remember solutions to tasks for as long as three years .			0

@entity26 and @entity7 bought six - month - old @entity24 over the internet
the raccoon provokes interest everywhere she goes , the couple say
@entity24 joins the pair 's 20 other pets , including a bearded dragon and a skunk
