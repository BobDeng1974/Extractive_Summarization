@entity1 and @entity2 trusted @entity3 , whom they had known for 20 years , when he told them he could fulfill their dreams of having a child			1
the 52 - year - old , who is also deaf following a hit - and - run accident , conned the couple into handing over £ 6,000 , believing that he had arranged a surrogate birth			1
then when he told them the child had been born disabled , they parted with another £ 6,000 pounds for another baby			1
however , a judge heard that there never were any babies and ' devious liar ' @entity3 continued to fleece the childless couple with a bogus foreign property investment deal promising a return of up to £ 400,000			1
the conman is now starting a prison sentence for the scams which left @entity38 and mrs @entity2 devastated emotionally and financially			2
he told the couple he would use his contacts in @entity42 to arrange for a mother to carry their child after they had failed to conceive			1
the couple handed over £ 6,000 before being told the baby was born disabled			1
a deal for a second baby was reached but @entity3 extracted more money by saying the child was ill and there had been visa complications to delay its arrival			1
he even sent them fake pictures of the baby he called @entity58 , which he had actually taken from a photographer ’s website			0
in a separate scam , @entity3 persuaded mr @entity63 and his mother @entity64 to invest £ 55,000 and £ 34,000 respectively in a fake property development in @entity42			1
@entity67 , prosecuting at @entity66 , said that @entity3 met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend			1
he discovered they were trying for a baby through his ex-wife and embarked on ' a sophisticated fraud ' to convince them he could arrange a surrogate mother to give them the child they wanted			2
' in june 2011 he arranged for @entity2 to meet with a man known only as @entity82 , who said he could arrange the surrogate for them , ' said miss @entity67			1
' she took out a loan and paid £ 6,000 to @entity3 who said he would pass it on to @entity82 , who never appeared again			1
' the couple were told a mother , named @entity89 , had been found to carry their child			1
@entity67 , prosecuting at @entity66 , said that @entity3 met the couple in a group for deaf people around 20 years ago and was considered a good friend ' mr @entity63 said @entity3 attended the @entity96 fertility clinic , where he appeared to speak with the receptionist , leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to @entity42			1
' @entity3 told the couple this child was suffering from @entity105 ’s syndrome			1
' the @entity106 were upset at this news as they thought the child ’s disability , combined with their own deafness , would mean they would be unable to communicate together , ' said miss @entity67			0
@entity3 told the couple , from @entity111 , @entity112 , they would have to pay for a second mother to be found and a further £ 6,000 pounds was handed over after he said a woman named @entity115 had agreed			1
' he told them the baby had been called @entity58 and sent them photographs , ' said miss @entity67			0
mrs @entity2 gave up her job in february 2013 to prepare for @entity58 ’s arrival but @entity3 repeatedly said complications had come up which required more money before she could come to @entity124			1
' they were told @entity58 had spina bifida and had to have an operation , that she was suffering with malaria and that there were difficulties with her visa , ' said miss @entity67			0
a woman claiming to be @entity115 called mr @entity63 and demanded more money , as did @entity3 , who said if it was not paid the baby would be given to someone else			2
investigations found no paperwork documenting the transfer of eggs and sperm to @entity42 , which is strictly regulated by fertility clinics and the photographs purporting to be @entity58 were in fact taken by a @entity146 photographer of his daughter and uploaded online			0
@entity3 had already convinced mr @entity63 he was involved in a building project in @entity42 which , once completed , would earn investors a large return			2
' mr @entity63 was persuaded on three occasions to remortgage his home and take out high - interest loans , to the amount of £ 55,000 , ' said miss @entity67			0
in 2007 , mr @entity63 ’s mother @entity64 became concerned after finding out his mortgage , which had originally been for £ 35,000 , was then for £ 143,000			0
after the scheme was explained to her , @entity64 attempted to find out what was happening between 2007 and 2008			0
in 2011 , @entity3 emailed mr @entity63 telling him he would be receiving £ 90,000 after seven @entity42 apartments were sold , in exchange for £ 1,500 in legal fees			1
he showed his mother the email and @entity3 visited her in early 2012 to show her false documents claiming rights to build and land ownership in the @entity169 country			2
mr @entity63 said @entity3 attended the @entity96 fertility clinic , where he appeared to speak with the receptionist , leading them to believe that eggs and sperm held at the clinic were going to be sent to @entity42 @entity3 , from @entity176 , @entity177 , told mr @entity63 he would be paid a total of £ 400,000 and asked @entity64 for £ 9,000 which would make her £ 105,000 in return			1
she paid the money and also agreed to a further £ 25,000 for an eventual return of £ 140,000			0
neither mr @entity63 nor his mother has ever seen any return on their investments			0
@entity3 was arrested on september 3 , 2013 , and admitted telling the @entity106 he could arrange a surrogate mother and that the two children suffered the disabilities described , but said he had lost contact with ‘ mother ’ @entity115			1
' he described himself in relation to this operation as just being a mediator and denied he had kept any money given to him , ' said miss @entity67			0
he told police he had several bank accounts in @entity42 but could not provide details and claimed he had been sent the photographs by @entity115			0
the court heard he had 11 previous convictions for numerous offences dating back to 1982 , including theft , forgery and making false statements			0
he was jailed for eight years in 1992 for robbing a jeweller while armed and for two years in 1999 for attempting to obtain property by deception			0
@entity208 , mitigating , asked for leniency from @entity210 as prison would be ' more onerous , ' for @entity3 due to his deafness - who accepted what he did was wrong			2
' he has now shown some sympathy , empathy and understanding of the consequences of his actions on the @entity106			0
' the court heard @entity3 was keen to pay compensation to his victims , and a @entity224 confiscation hearing is due to take place on june 13 at @entity66			2
miss @entity208 said @entity3 was born partially deaf but lost hearing in both ears in a hit - and - run accident in the early 1990s , which contributed to his offending as he lost his job and independence as a result of it			0
she added that he had been abused as a child and was only recently coming to terms with the idea it may have impacted on him			0
the court heard @entity3 has a wife and six - year - old child , who is also deaf , living in @entity42			2
judge @entity210 , sentencing , said : ' the evidence in this case demonstrates you are a devious liar and a scheming fraudsman			0
in relation to @entity38 and mrs @entity2 , you preyed on their emotions and the long - standing wish to have a child			2
' he added : ' putting it shortly , in a despicable way you conned them out of large sums of money			0
' all three victims have suffered substantial financial loses which they could ill afford and their victim impact statements indicate the worry , upset and anguish you have caused to them by the very serious breaches of trust			0
' @entity3 , who wore a blue short - sleeved shirt and jeans , was sentenced to 18 months for two charges relating to the baby scam and two years for two charges relating to the property scheme , to run consecutively for a total of three and a half years			2
