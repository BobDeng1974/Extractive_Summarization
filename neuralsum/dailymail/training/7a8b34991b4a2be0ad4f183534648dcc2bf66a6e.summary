for most of us ' liking ' a status or ' sharing ' a picture can seem like completely natural acts , but would they make any sense when taken out of context ? a @entity9 video blogger , @entity8 , took to the streets of @entity11 to see what reaction she would receive if she used online lingo in day to day life			1
her video , which captures her approaching strangers to poke , like and view them , has been viewed 90,000 times			1
she said : ' social networking is completely out of control these days but do the things we do online make sense in real life ? ' the film swiftly moves on to @entity8 stalking a woman before tapping her on the shoulder and calling out to her			1
' mam , i just want to let you know that i 'm following you			2
just giving you an alert ' says @entity46 , referring to the act of ' following ' someone on @entity49			2
unsurprisingly the woman looks a little confused before mumbling ' okay ' , but @entity8 keeps up the act saying : ' you do n't have to do anything			1
just know it and enjoy it			0
' @entity8 continues to ' follow ' several people on the street telling one bewildered woman : ' @entity8 is now following you , just do whatever and i will just watch			1
' at grand central station she announced that she had ' checked in ' , a way of updating location on @entity65 the film switches to the vlogger prodding a man in a blue jacket			0
' you want to poke me back ? ' she asks him and he obliges			0
' is n't that fun ? ' she says			0
her fellow ' poker ' does n't seem as sure , ' yeah , it 's just weird though i do n't even know you , ' he points out			0
' i know but that 's what you do right ? ' she responds after re-enacting the @entity65 action of using the poke button to contact a friend			0
@entity8 continues the @entity65 theme , this time by providing passers - by with a notification of a friend 's change of job			1
@entity46 makes connections much like on @entity25 using the man sitting next to her using a megaphone @entity8 announces : ' @entity92 started working at @entity94 law firm , ' before asking pedestrians to ' comment ' on the update			1
the comedian then decides to see how the characteristics of the professional network @entity25 would work in a actual social situation			2
she approaches a man who is adding sugar to his beverage and compliments him on his technique before adding : ' i want to endorse you for your coffee - making skills ' she tells him			0
she continues to endorse several other customers before asking another if she would like to endorse her back			0
at this point @entity8 decides to send out a few friend requests , which users of @entity65 will be familiar with , this is the action of inviting another user to connect with you			1
@entity8 teamed up with @entity32 to see if social networking behaviour can work in real life she approaches a table where two men are siting and says : ' hi guys i was wondering if you would accept my friendship request ? ' when they just look at her blankly @entity8 decides to change her approach and see if they would rather be connected in a business sense as done on @entity25			1
' he looks really important with , like , the whole button - down , ' @entity8 says to one of the men , adding , ' do you want to be connected ? ' @entity8 then takes the professional network to the @entity136 letting travellers know just how many ' views ' their ' profile ' has received			1
' i just want to let you know that 12 people have viewed you , ' she tells one of the passengers			2
' what does that mean ? ' asks a bewildered woman			0
' i do n't know , you must be really important they 're like viewing you			0
that guy chose to remain anonymous , ' explains @entity8			1
next up @entity8 takes to the busy grand central station to play out some popular @entity65 interactions			1
' i have just checked into grand central station , ' she screams , before grabbing a stranger and asking his name before repeating ' @entity46 and @entity154 have just checked into grand central station with about 452 other people , ' referencing the popular craze of listing your location			2
@entity8 asked people to comment on something before telling them she ' liked ' it , a common @entity65 action one of the few actions that @entity8 recreates that actually does seem to make some sense in a social situation is the act of sharing , whereby users can re-post something they have found amusing			1
a woman with a small dog walks by and @entity174 stops her : ' @entity175 , mam , that is so cute , i have to share this with everybody			0
' this seems to encourage the most normal reaction			0
' do you want to comment on how cute this is ? ' she asks one elderly woman who agrees			0
' this is cute , ' she says while @entity8 gives her the thumbs - up and tells her , ' i like your comment			1
' the final part of the video sees the act of making connections online , something that can be done through having mutual connections on @entity25 , allowing users to make even more connections			2
' excuse me sir , can you introduce me to that guy who 's sitting next to you ? ' @entity8 asks her neighbour in a shoe - shining booth			2
the man to her left , is completely bemused but introduces the pair before @entity8 explains why she thought they ought to meet			2
' we had him in common so i figured i should meet you			0
and now we 're all connected			0

@entity8 liked , poked , followed and shared with people in real life
