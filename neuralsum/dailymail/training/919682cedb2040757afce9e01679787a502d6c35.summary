the videos appeared to be labelled as football matches but one line of inquiry for police is likely to be whether @entity1 was interested in the type of jihadi videos watched by the july 2005 @entity4 bombers			1
the four bombers were linked to an extreme bookshop in @entity55 which distributed videos of terrorist acts , exhorting followers to emulate them			2

he loved @entity12 and had his books			2
‘ but more recently , he would just put his head down when he saw me			0
even if i tried to talk to him he was very dismissive			0
i thought it was weird			0

the man , who asked to remain anonymous , told @entity143 ’s @entity142 : ‘ that was n’t the same person			0
‘ he was n’t someone monstrous , that was not the same person			0
‘ he converted to @entity14 , preaching @entity14 , preaching peace			1
not preaching anything bad or anything negative			0
just literally the ways of @entity14			2
‘ i would see him going to mosque and coming back from mosque			0
‘ he was completely normal			0
