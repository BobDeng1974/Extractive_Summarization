by @entity0 ' that man ’s evil , he ’s a beast , he ’s a paedophile			2
in fact jail ’s too good for him , ' says @entity7			1
' i feel bitter towards him because he ’ll never realise what he ’s done			2
' @entity7 and her twin sister @entity11 , now 38 and from @entity13 , were just six years old when their childhood came to an abrupt end			1
unbeknown to each other , both had been attacked and brutally raped by a man they considered to be family , the husband of their @entity22 , @entity23			1
harrowing : after suffering in silence for almost 30 years , @entity11 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) finally spoke out innocent : the twins were just six years old when they were first raped by @entity27 appallingly , the abuse continued for more than a decade , only ending when @entity22 divorced her husband			1
it took another 20 years before the twins plucked up the courage to go to the police and last september , the pair were finally given the justice they craved when @entity23 was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his crimes			1
despite the verdict , however , the pair say they will never get over what happened to them and will never forgive their ' monster ' uncle			1
the girls ' ordeal began in the summer of 1978 , while they were staying with their much - loved @entity22 , then 16 , who was married to a 19 - year - old traveller named @entity23			1
for the twins , the carefree summers spent travelling were the highlight of their year , with both remembering golden days spent roaming the countryside around @entity52 in @entity53			2
' @entity54 was like a second mum , ' remembers @entity7			1
' even now i love her to bits			2
she was always there , we used to like school holidays , constantly we used to go with her			2
' ' we went all over the place , ' adds @entity11			1
' we 'd stay in caravans , trailers , as you would class them			2
' but the idyll was about to turn into a nightmare as @entity23 , previously thought of as a ' nice man ' by the twins , turned his peverted attentions to first @entity7 and then @entity11			1
' after raping me , he opened the door and acted as normal , ' remembers @entity75 of the first time her uncle attacked her			2
@entity7 , who , like her sister , was repeatedly abused between the ages of six and 13 , adds : ' i remember him turning round and saying that there could be blood there as well			1
and i remember that i cried myself to sleep that night			2
' i thought i must have done something wrong			2
i must have done something for him to have done that because you just do n’t do that to people			0
' it took me a long time to realise i never done nothing wrong			0
it was n’t me , it was him			0
he was in the wrong			0
' evil : @entity23 , from @entity53 , was sentenced to 10 years for his crimes in september 2013 she adds : ' you ’re only a wee child , and how do you know that ’s not normal ? ' it was n't long before @entity101 too fell victim to @entity23			1
' @entity54 was away - i think she was at my granny ’s , ' she recalls			0
' and @entity23 shouted me to come through to his bed			1
and he got himself on top of me			0
his exact words , on my telling him it was sore , him telling me it would be alright , it ’d only hurt for a minute			0
' it was n’t my fault , i did n’t have a choice , ' she continues			0
' this man done what he did to us , and there was nothing i could do about it			0
' i was n’t strong enough then			0
then i did n’t think i ’d have been believed because , well , i was feared i was feared of destroying everybody ’s life , my @entity54 @entity22 ’s life			0
' the abuse continued for more than a decade but , incredibly , neither twin knew what was happening to the other			1
both , however , began struggling at school , regularly missing classes , and grew apart with both harbouring resentment towards the other			2
' i never thought that it was happening to @entity11 , ' says @entity7			1
' i just believed it was happening to me because i was his special twin			0
childhood : the girls spent childhood summers staying with their aunt @entity22 on a traveller camp like this one ' i ’ve blamed her , i thought i was the only one , and i ’ve blamed her all my life basically for not getting anything what i got			0
but you know what ? she got it too - she ’s been punished all her life as well			0
' their ordeal finally came to an end when their aunt @entity22 , fed up with her husband 's womanising ways , divorced him in 1986 when the girls were 13			2
although they soon lost contact with @entity23 , both suffered flashbacks and @entity7 succumbed to severe depression			1
@entity11 , meanwhile , found herself spiralling into a vicious circle of drugs , unstable relationships and even contemplated suicide			1
' i never dealt with it because it ’s there every day of your life , ' she says			0
' i thought i was getting through life ok but i was n't because i ended up taking drugs , i tried to take my own life twice			0
' i ’ve fought eating disorders , i fought depression , so i ’ve had a multitude of things , all while thinking that i was coping when i was n’t coping , but that was my way of getting through what had happened to me			0
' for more than 17 years , the sisters kept the truth about @entity23 to themselves , telling no one - not even each other - until , during a rare meeting at their brother @entity179 's funeral - they finally plucked up the courage to confide in each other			1
idyll : the girls ' childhood in a beautiful part of @entity187 were ruined by @entity23 's appalling crimes ' we were sitting at the front door , and i asked her had any bad things ever happened to her , and she says “ yes			1
” , ' recalls @entity7			1
' we never spoke about it again			0
i was so sad - even now we ’ve never really sat down and really spoke about it			0
' while the sisters struggled to come to terms with what had happened , @entity23 remained free and continued as he always had			1
but after a chance conversation between @entity11 and her aunt @entity22 , his trouble - free lifestyle was about to come to an end			1
' i thought she thought that we had been with him in that [ sexual ] sense , so i looked at her and i went : “ it ’s not what you think			0
” ' and she looked at me and she went : “ what do you mean ? ” i went : “ we did n’t have a choice			0
” she went : " what do you mean , you did n’t have a choice ? ” ' i went : “ we did n’t , he raped us , sexually abused us			2
” and that was it , that was the start of it			0
' days later , the sisters finally reported @entity23 to the police and he was arrested within hours			1
in september 2013 , he went on trial for the rapes and sexual assaults of his two nieces more than 30 years earlier			1
despite protesting his innocence and later offering to take a lie detector test , the 15 - strong jury found him guilty on two counts of rape and four other sexual offences , and he was handed a 10 year prison term			1
for the sisters , the overwhelming emotion was one of relief			2
' finally , i could speak out and tell everybody what an animal he was , ' says @entity11			1
' i did n’t have to be scared of him any longer			0
i could stand up and shout as loud as i wanted : “ that man raped me , that man sexually abused me , that man ’s a monster			2
" ' ' that man took my life , that ’s what he done , ' adds @entity7			1
' he put me in the dark but now i ’m out of the dark and i ’ve got my life back			0
' and the twins , torn apart by what happened to them , have since revived their relationship and say they 're now closer than ever			0
' i could never have done this without my sister , she ’s my world , she ’s my twin now , ' adds @entity75			0
' i used to have a sister , but now i ’ve got my twin - something i should have had all my life , but he destroyed that			0
' but now i ’ve got her and he ca n’t destroy it anymore			0
