but in a miraculous twist , @entity3 is believed to have woken up 23 - year - old @entity5 after he suffered a series of strokes that left him in a coma			1
@entity5 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was playing football in february 2010 when his head began to pound so severely he screamed for an ambulance			1

‘ there was actually a doctor that told us that we would be better off letting @entity5 contract an infection , put him in a home and just let him die			1
’ @entity5 would never be able to walk , talk or recognise his loved ones , and would likely be blind , doctors said			1
plans : @entity5 and his fiancee @entity23 were supposed to marry in may - three months after the strokes active : @entity5 was healthy and fit - and doctors are uncertain why he suffered the devastating strokes no hope : after the strokes , @entity5 was in a coma in the @entity51 for 45 days			1
doctors told the family there was no hope of recovery and they should let him contract an infection , move him to a home and let him die , his finacee said but @entity23 refused to give up on her boyfriend of four years , whom she had been planning to marry three months later			2
on the day of her planned wedding , @entity23 said the struggle momentarily became too much			0
‘ i did n't cope very well at all and i actually completely lost it , ’ she told @entity63			0
‘ i 'd say i probably had a nervous breakdown			0
‘ but i picked myself up pretty quickly after that , dusted myself off because what i was going through was nothing compared to what @entity5 was going through , nothing at all			1
’ after 45 days in a coma in the @entity51 at @entity71 – where he also contracted pneumonia – @entity5 woke up and began making slow progress			1
with intense therapy , he began walking , but was still unable to speak or function alone			0
he could only moan and had the brain function of a young child			0

she researched options on the internet and found that sleeping pill @entity3 had helped other stroke sufferers regain speech and movement in the past recovery : @entity5 can now speak after taking the pills			1
@entity23 has quit her job to look after him full time devoted : the drugs wear off after an hour , at which point @entity5 's speech becomes unintelligible again desperate to help her fiancé , @entity23 turned to the internet , where she found a video of another young stroke sufferer feeding himself and talking – thanks to doses of the sleeping aid @entity3			1

so far he has found that fewer than 10 per cent of stroke victims respond to the drug - and that @entity5 's case is extremely rare			1
' we ’re not able to yet advise families on how to use this drug clinically because the research is in the very early stages , ' he told @entity29			0
‘ it just blew my mind , ’ said @entity23 , who then pleaded with doctors to give the drug to her fiancé			2
they refused , citing the lack of studies into the connection			0
‘ they almost laughed at us really			0
they did n’t think it was possible that a sleeping pill could awaken someone			0
but i felt compelled to			0
’ so @entity23 lied , saying @entity5 needed the pills to sleep and just days later , after a year of only being able to moan unintelligible sounds , he did the impossible – he began to talk			2
he immediately phoned his parents and left them a message			0
' there was @entity5 saying , " i ’m talking , i ’m talking "			2
it was unbelievable ' , his father @entity150 told @entity29			0

on being able to speak again , he ' felt like shouting it from the rooftops ' , @entity5 told @entity28			2
' that ’s the best part about the @entity3 , ' @entity23 said			2
' it shows what i believed was true – he was really in there			2
' @entity5 takes four doses of @entity3 a day , but it only lasts an hour or less			1
future : they still hope to marry			0
