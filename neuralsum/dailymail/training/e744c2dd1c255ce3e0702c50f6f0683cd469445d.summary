@entity0 celebrated his move to the @entity2 by meeting @entity3 – but is he the answer to @entity6 ’s creative prayers ? the @entity8 playmaker completed a season - long loan switch to the @entity10 on deadline day , with a view to making the deal permanent for £ 8.5millon next summer			1
but what will the 26 - year - old bring to @entity17 ? @entity18 takes a closer look … @entity8 to @entity6 … why ? @entity8 are going through a rebuilding process after a couple of disappointing seasons and @entity0 , despite appearing 29 times in @entity24 last year , was one player coach @entity25 was willing to let go in a bid to manoeuvre his squad			1
@entity28 was alerted and @entity6 moved quickly to get the deal in place last week			0
divine inspiration : lvarez celebrates scoring for @entity8 and will be hoping to score plenty for @entity6 physical presence : @entity0 is 6ft 2in but has a proven touch and good vision so how has he fared at the @entity37 ? he leaves with 11 goals from 73 appearances over three seasons – which is a fair return on both counts – but there have been periods where he has struggled to impact and his future at the club questioned			1
he has failed to make one position on the park his own , but at the same time has shown flashes of creative genius , especially when operating in a withdrawn role behind a striker			2
the frustration for @entity8 fans was amplified by the reputation with which he arrived and the inability to produce his best on a consistent basis			0
what about his early days ? his move to @entity61 came after four seasons with @entity63 , where a cruciate ligament injury had curtailed his early progress			0
but come the end of his time in @entity68 his stock was high and , having just helped @entity63 to a second league championship , @entity8 paid £ 10m for the then 23 - year - old			1
mixing it with the best : @entity0 ( left ) played in @entity73 on monday catch him if you can : @entity0 gets away from @entity76 manager @entity75 proven quality : @entity0 has seven caps for @entity68 and has scored one goal so what type of player is he ? he ’s a rangy type – 6ft 2ins – and not particularly pacey either , but it ’s his skill and vision on the ball which makes him a full international and persuaded @entity8 to invest all that money three years ago			1
his first touch is second nature and he can unlock a defence in an instant			0
where will he fit in at @entity6 ? left - footed , @entity0 can cut in from the right flank – but that is a domain already populated by @entity95			2
his best performances for @entity8 came in a @entity98 role and , to that end , he could well operate in an advanced position of a midfield three alongside @entity101 and @entity102			1
so will he prove a success ? he ’s certainly got a point to prove , inconsistency being his key criticism			0
but there is ability there and he was part of the @entity68 squad which finished runners - up at the @entity113 in @entity114			2
he ’s currently on international duty and met @entity3 this week – and @entity28 will be hoping @entity0 repays the faith he has shown in his fellow @entity117 .			0

@entity0 sealed a loan move to @entity6 on deadline day
@entity122 could make move permanent for £ 8.5m next summer
26 - year - old scored 11 goals in 73 games for @entity8
@entity0 has seven caps for @entity68 and has scored one goal
