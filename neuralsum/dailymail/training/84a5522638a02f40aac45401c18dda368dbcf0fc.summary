the owners of the two - foot tall pony just could n't figure out why he had become so bad - tempered , until they noticed his stomach was all bloated			1
it was n't the result of eating too much hay , however , that was causing the problem , but @entity1 's strange habit of swallowing sand			2
snacking on sand : @entity1 the 2ft high @entity15 pony became ill after grazing on sand in an all - weather paddock he had been left to exercise in an outdoor all - weather paddock and , it seemed , had taken to the taste of its grainy covering			1
unfortunately , his new meal had blocked his large intestine and this was having an effect on his other organs			1
his owners and other horse - lovers rallied round to quickly raise £ 6,000 for life - saving treatment and @entity1 is now making a full recovery			1
owner @entity32 , from @entity33 near @entity34 , @entity35 , bought @entity1 when he was six months old for her eight - year - old daughter @entity36			1
escape artist : @entity1 , seen here with her eight - year - old owner @entity36 , needed emergency surgery to flush out the build - up of sand ' as soon as i saw him i knew we had to have him , ' mrs @entity32 said			1
' but after a while we noticed his tummy was getting bigger and bigger			0
day - in , day - out it just kept swelling			0
' i thought he might need worming and i kept a firm control on his food intake			0
' it did not stop and the vets took a blood sample which said his liver was n't working properly			0
' they gave him more tests and my horse insurance level of £ 1,000 ran out			2
' we had to fund any future treatment ourselves			0
' happy again : the miniature pony is now making a full recovery after the emergency treatment , which was paid for by local horse lovers fellow horse lovers at the @entity69 at @entity70 , where @entity1 lives , decided to raise money for treatment by going on a sponsored walk			1
