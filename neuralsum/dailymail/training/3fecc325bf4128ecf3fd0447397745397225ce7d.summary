after 19 matches , including winning @entity5 gold at @entity6 , last year ’s title at the @entity8 and , of course , @entity10 , @entity1 ’s glorious streak on grass finally came to an end			2
we knew it would eventually , but few could have predicted it would be with a whimper			2
the @entity17 no 1 was beaten in straight sets 7 - 6 6 - 2 by @entity19 , the 35 - year - old ranked no 42 in the world , and beaten well			1
it was all too much for one ballgirl , who was overcome by fatigue during the lengthy first set tiebreak which @entity19 won 12 - 10			1
@entity1 seemed a little bewildered by events himself , squandering eight set points in that tiebreak and losing his first service game in the second set			0
@entity19 , a seasoned @entity53 campaigner , refused to give in to the younger man as his friend , @entity52 goalkeeper @entity51 , looked on			0
@entity19 sealed the tiebreak and then cantered through the second set , breaking @entity1 twice , to earn a quarter - final tie against @entity58			1
spring in his step : @entity19 celebrates his victory over @entity1 the @entity10 champion , one of the best returners in the game , struggled to pick the @entity64 ’s first serve , on which @entity19 lost only four points , and was pushed back on the court as the veteran seized advantage at the net			1
there was certainly plenty for @entity1 ’s new coach , @entity30 , to ponder as she scribbled notes			1
@entity1 said : ‘ ​ i have only got myself to blame that i lost the first set			1
quite a lot of them were on my serve and , on this surface especially , you should n’t really be losing sets like that			1
for me , that ’s what ’s disappointing really			0
i blew the first set and that was my fault			0
i have played well on the grass over the last few years and my best results came when i had a decent amount of preparation time			0
‘ it ’s more about how i get myself ready for @entity10 now and hopefully i can do a good job of that			0
’ @entity1 ’s unbeaten run on grass is over , but there is no cause for despair with @entity10 just over a week away			0
the 27 - year - old did not play on the clay at @entity99 last year after pulling out of the @entity99 with a back injury and practised for 10 days on grass before winning @entity25 ’s and @entity10 , becoming only the seventh man to achieve the feat. ca n't put my finger on it : @entity1 's fell away after narrowly losing the first set on the chase : @entity1 attempts to return a shot to @entity19 during his third round match this time , he has come into the tournament straight from a @entity99 semi-final , with only two days to adjust			1
he looked a little rusty and upright when confronted with the lower bounce on grass and said his hamstrings felt slightly stiff , but @entity1 is not alone in struggling with the transition			0
@entity116 was beaten on grass in @entity118 , @entity119 , where @entity120 needed three sets to edge past @entity122			1
@entity123 , meanwhile , was last spotted relaxing at a beach club in @entity125			0
@entity1 went to the gym ‘ to do some weights ’ immediately after yesterday ’s defeat and will not pick up a racket again until he plays mixed doubles in the ‘ @entity131 ’ , in memory of @entity133 , at @entity25 ’s on sunday			2
talk it through : @entity1 tries to regroup during a changeover hitting home : @entity1 faltered badly during the final set eye opener : despite the defeat , @entity1 still has high hopes to defend his @entity10 title he plans to relax , catch up with friends and watch the @entity143 in the interim , although he laughed and admitted he will leave the gardening to his girlfriend , @entity146			2
it transpires @entity1 prefers to play on grass , rather than mow it			0
‘ i have never mowed a lawn in my life , ’ he said			0
‘ i would n’t want to mess it up and it would n’t look great if i tried			0
’ after that will come an exhibition match at the @entity156 in @entity157 and then three or four days practising in the relative ‘ peace and quiet ’ of the @entity159 before everything ‘ gets quite hectic ’ in the last few days before @entity10 begins			2
that , you would imagine , could be something of an understatement from the first @entity17 man for 77 years to defend the title			1
all smiles : @entity1 's girlfriend @entity146 ( left ) shares a joke with the @entity170 's coach @entity30 ( right ) seeing the funny side : @entity172 ( left ) and @entity30 seemed to build a rapport courtside high interest : a packed @entity25 's crowd watched @entity1 's clash with @entity19			1
