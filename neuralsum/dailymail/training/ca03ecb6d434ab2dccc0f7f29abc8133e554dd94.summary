by @entity0 a tiny bat has become the first on record to fly from @entity4 to mainland @entity5 - despite being just the size of a thumb			1
the @entity9 ' pipistrelle bat was last seen near @entity10 in 2012 before being discovered 370 miles away in the @entity11 last month			1
it is the first known @entity4 bat to have crossed the @entity13 and the finding gives weight to claims that the bats may migrate in a similar way to birds			1
researchers attached a miniature identity ring to a tiny @entity9 ' pipistrelle bat , pictured , in october 2012			1
it was discovered in the @entity11 last month , making it the first known bat to have crossed the @entity13			2
the finding gives weight to claims @entity4 bats may migrate in a similar way to birds the reddish - brown furred @entity9 ' pipistrelle typically grows to between 46 and 55mm in length , with a wingspan of 220 to 250mm			1
it is a protected species in many countries and is so rare in @entity4 , experts are anxious to protect the remaining numbers			0
threats to the species include the loss of hollow trees and toxic chemicals from the treatment of timber in buildings			0
experts say it is important to track the tiny creatures ' movements so that wind turbines are n't built in their flight path			0
bats as small as the @entity9 ' pipistrelle are hard to tail because they are too small to carry the sort of sophisticated satellite trackers used to monitor bird migration			0
@entity59 of the @entity60 said there had been occasional reports of bats landing on @entity13 oil platforms - but this was the first proof that they were capable of reaching the continent			0
researchers from @entity69 attached a miniature identity ring to the tiny bat in october 2012 as part of research into bat migration habits			1
the 7.6g mammal 's last know @entity4 location was @entity78 , a small village in the @entity80 just outside @entity10			1
yet on 23 december last year , a wildlife expert found it dead inside a farm shed used to store fruit in @entity85 , on the north coast of the @entity11			2
the bat ’s exact route remains unknown , although researchers believe it likely would have travelled past @entity90 , before crossing the @entity91 and heading northeast along the @entity93 and @entity94 coastline and the @entity13			1
experts say it 's important to track the tiny creatures ' movements so wind turbines are n't built in their flight path			0
however , bats as small as the @entity9 ' pipistrelle are hard to tail because they are too small to carry the sort of sophisticated satellite trackers used to monitor bird migration			0
the mammal was last spotted in the @entity4 at @entity78 , pictured , a small village just outside @entity10 in 2012			1
on 23 december last year , a wildlife expert found the same bat inside a farm shed in @entity85 , pictured , on the north coast of the @entity11			2
the bat 's exact route remains unknown @entity59 of the @entity60 said there had been occasional reports of bats landing on @entity13 oil platforms - but this was the first proof that they were capable of reaching the continent			1
he said : ‘ we have hypothesised for a long time about the migration of bats to and from the @entity4 but it 's very difficult to prove			2
experts say it 's important to track the movements of the rare , tiny creatures , pictured , to ensure wind turbines are n't built in their flight path ‘ this finding was a great surprise and is helping us to understand the huge journeys that these bats can make			0
‘ we already knew that bats migrated over incredibly long distances over land , but were not sure whether they flew over the sea			0
‘ as a result of this finding , we suspect that this in fact happens quite a lot			0
’ the reddish - brown furred @entity9 ' pipistrelle typically grows to between 46 and 55mm in length , with a wingspan of 220 to 250mm			0
it is extremely rare in @entity4 and experts are anxious to prevent the remaining numbers from facing certain death by flying into wind turbines			0
biosciences expert dr @entity150 , who is spearheading @entity69 's bats and @entity153 project , said : ' @entity9 's pipistrelle is one of the species most at risk from land - based wind turbines throughout @entity5			1
‘ we now urgently need to identify the migration routes they use to cross the sea between the @entity4 and continental @entity5 - offshore wind farms in the wrong place could be very bad news			2
' dr @entity164 will now analyse samples from the bat in an attempt to establish whether it originated in the @entity4 or the @entity11 , and whether it had only recently arrived or had spent the summer there .			2

researchers from @entity69 *fitted* the 7.6g bat with an identity ring in 2012
it was last seen in @entity10 before being found in the @entity11 last month
this makes the tiny bat the first on record to fly from @entity4 to @entity5
its exact route is unknown , but the findings add weight to claims @entity4 bats may migrate in a similar way to birds
