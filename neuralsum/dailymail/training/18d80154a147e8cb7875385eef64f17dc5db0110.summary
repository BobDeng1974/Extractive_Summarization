@entity0 faces being jeered by some sections of the @entity3 fanbase when he finally arrives at the @entity5 club			1
supporters had bought season - tickets and shirts on the back of @entity0 ’s summer unveiling and news that he will not be joining them until july – and that he never signed a playing contract in the first place – has not been well received			1
@entity15 - president of @entity18 supporters group – told @entity19 : ‘ the whole situation is very frustrating			0
@entity21 have admitted that they have misled fans and @entity23 over @entity0 city had wrongly claimed that @entity0 signed for @entity23 last summer before agreeing a loan move ‘ if we ’d known all of the details from the start then we would not be as upset as we have been this past week			1
all of this could have been easily avoided			0
‘ but we have a problem with transparency in the @entity5 in general and i feel for @entity0 being caught in the middle of it			2
’ @entity18 co-founder @entity36 added : ‘ it comes down to how they presented it – he was wearing the shirt and we were told he was definitely going to play			2
‘ then we were told he was staying at @entity21 and now that he had never signed at all			1
‘ we ’re confident he ’ll still come here to play but some fans have already taken back shirts with his name on and say they ’re going to boo him			2
@entity0 smiles during his press conference after it was announced he would be joining the @entity5 club the former @entity51 man pictured in action during @entity21 's @entity54 clash with @entity55 ‘ personally , i wo n’t be doing that because i 'm putting my heart 100 per cent behind this new team , but the reaction has been very mixed towards him and this situation			1
’ @entity61 , meanwhile , understands why some fans feel aggrieved			0
‘ clarity is the big issue here and some fans feel they ’ve been lied to – be that by the league , the club or the player , so i understand why some people want to show their feelings when he does play , ’ he said			2
‘ but the fact there was no contract does not bother me and i think @entity0 ’s statement was very clear and seemed pro @entity3			1
‘ we just hope all of this is sorted and he does come to play here in july			0
’ i want to make it completely clear about my situation as i have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days			0
when released from @entity51 last year at the end of my contract i signed a commitment to play in @entity3 for two years starting january 1 2015			1
i was then offered the chance to train and be part of the @entity21 squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into @entity23			0
this period has since been extended by @entity21 and i now will start playing for @entity3 at the end of this current @entity54 season			1
there has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone			0
i can say that i am very excited about arriving in @entity23 and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the @entity5 as soon as possible			0
thanks everyone for your ongoing support and i wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015 !			0

@entity3 fans were told they had signed @entity0
but the @entity115 *midfielder* was then ' loaned ' to @entity21
now @entity0 will remain at @entity21 for the remainder of the season
the club also revealed he never actually signed for @entity3
some fans are angry after *buying* season tickets to watch @entity0 play
