the 2015 @entity1 , the last to be broadcast by the @entity8 , will be at @entity28 @entity8 's golf team ( from left to right ) @entity35 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 but the @entity4 ’s decision to take the money from subscription tv – chief executive @entity44 ’s last big move before he steps down later this year – will not do anything to help golf ’s falling participation figures and has been widely criticised by numerous big names in the sport , including @entity14 , @entity50 and @entity38			1
speaking in an open letter on the @entity1 's official website , @entity44 said : ' we believe this new arrangement , which will see the @entity1 broadcast live on @entity0 with prime - time highlights on the @entity8 , will allow golf ’s oldest championship to maintain its position as one of the world ’s premier sporting events			1

' however , we 're pleased to be continuing our 60 - year partnership with the @entity4 and feel that a comprehensive two hour highlights programme - a format which has already proven successful - in a prime - time slot over four days will allow us to continue to bring all the best action and key moments from @entity1 to a large free - to - air audience on tv , radio and online			1
