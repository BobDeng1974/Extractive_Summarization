@entity0 ( above ) is on a mission to re-write the history books and find evidence of @entity6 explorers as far back as the early 1520s in @entity7 this map from 1542 shows a place called ' @entity25 ' ( above ) which is exactly where @entity7 is on maps today mr @entity0 has more than six decades of diving experience and has made more than 150 documentaries on marine life for the @entity30 mr @entity0 says maps dated from the 1520s show a large sixth continent in the same position as present - day @entity7 , called ' @entity25 ' in many similar charts and navigational aids			1
the self - described ' wreck hunter ' set off from his base in @entity39 on saturday on the @entity41 catamaran			0
the journey will see him stay off @entity11 in @entity12 for a week before continuing his explorations further north towards the remote @entity44 at the tip of the country			2
he is travelling with four other crew members , including his son @entity48 , 31 , who is the chief scuba diving guide on @entity30 ships			0
this is a 500 - year - old @entity52 map showiing the coast of @entity7 created by the first explorers mr @entity0 and his team are on the @entity41 catamaran for the next six weeks looking for a cannon mr @entity0 and his crew are searching off the coast of @entity11 , north of @entity59 , for the evidence the film maker and explorer told @entity63 from out at sea : ' three @entity6 ships and a @entity52 vessel were lost near @entity44 in the 1520s before the @entity18 arrived			1
' i have clues as to where the wrecks might be and we are looking for a cannon which will date it			0
' most historians agree the @entity6 were here first but we have to prove it			0
' mr @entity0 discovered this anchor at the @entity79 shipwreck in 1977 which sunk in 1841 in the @entity80 , @entity12 @entity81 captured this cannon at wreckage of @entity84 in 1985 east of @entity44 ' there was an early chart made in 1522 , not released until 1542 and it clearly shows the @entity11 area and shows reefs off the coast			1
' it means a lot when something was charted in quite heavy detail and so we know they spent a lot of time here			2
' we believe it was a man called @entity100 was one of the first @entity6 men to have charted the coast of @entity7 in 1522/23 and he would have been the earliest person that we know of			1
' we are looking for the absolute proof of @entity6 landing , there are clues but hopefully this voyage will lead to solid evidence			2
' the searching is very hard and has already involved lots of swimming , we are looking for things which have been underwater for 500 years old			0
' this was 250 years before @entity118 and appreciate that when @entity118 's cannons were found they were a metre under the coral			0
mr @entity0 found these @entity52 coins on the wreck of @entity84 in 1985 which is east of @entity44 on the @entity125 off the coast of @entity12 mr @entity0 and his team will have to spend hours snorkelling looking for historical objects under the coral ' we are snorkelling in shallow water but we are looking for objects which are probably two metres under the coral			1
' mr @entity0 , who has produced more than 150 marine documentaries since the 1960s , found the @entity135 shipwreck which was 135 miles south east off @entity44 in 1977 - it is the most historical shipwreck in @entity7 and that sunk in 1791			1
1401 : @entity137 sailors visit near @entity138 1451 : @entity18 documents record the journeys of @entity142 traders from @entity143 to @entity7 , or as they knew it to ‘ @entity144 ’ 1500 : @entity143 fishers visit northern @entity7 , which would last two centuries 1521 : some historians claim the @entity6 visited @entity7 during this time , which is what mr @entity0 is seeking to prove			1
feb / march 1606 : the @entity150 explored the western coast of the @entity44			0
this is the first recorded landfall by a @entity19 on @entity7 soil			1
1616 - 1696 : a range of @entity157 and @entity18 explorers visited different parts of @entity7			1
1770 : famed @entity157 captain @entity118 charted the continent ’s east coast in 1770 , which later opened the door to @entity164 colonisation			0
he told @entity63 : ' we have already done a lot of swimming and could not find the cannon that we were looking for			2
' @entity170 more swimming needs to be done			0
if we find the cannon i am looking for we can date the period			0
' we had other clues , we have ballast rocks - they are the rocks you put in the ship to keep it steady in the water and when a ship is wrecked			0
we are also have the early maps			0
' i am very excited about this trip , it 's on my bucket list , i want to find the most important shipwreck in @entity7			2
'' it 's likely there were three explorers between 1520 and 1525 that came to @entity7 but we need positive proof			2
' mr @entity0 is also on the lookout for other wrecks and said he was going to go back to previous sites he had discovered to check the dating because we could have been on a much older wreck			1
' i know the cannon is out there but it is going to be very hard to find			2
it takes a lot of searching and i am letting the world know this time			0
i thought i might as well because it is very important			0
