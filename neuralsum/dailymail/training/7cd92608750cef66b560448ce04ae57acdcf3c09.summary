the new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities , the high court judges said			1
they said the new appeal process would serve to ' not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime , but to possibly outline the subjective position of @entity90 's accomplices '			0
