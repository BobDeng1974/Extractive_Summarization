by @entity0 most airlines begin life as major government - owned projects or as the ambitious playthings of billionaires with endless piles of cash to spare			0
not as start - ups funded via a whip - round on the internet			0
but such is the curious situation with a new high - end carrier which intends to come to life via the decidedly modern money - raising method of ‘ crowd - funding ’			1
taking off : @entity16 plans to operate business - class flights from @entity19 airport a @entity19 - based entrepreneur has announced plans for @entity16 – a business - class only operation which will fly between the @entity25 capital and @entity26 from 2016 – assuming that the $ 8.5million ( £ 5million ) needed can be sourced from small investors			1
‘ crowd - funding ’ has developed as a concept in the last two or three years			1
close to the action : flying from @entity19 will help the airline cater to business class passengers usually , it sees funds to support a medium - sized idea – a rock band without a record label trying to record an album ; a fledgling film - maker trying to produce a documentary – raised from a large number of small backers rather than a single financial giant			2
‘ crowd - funding ’ also tends to occur via an internet petition , with social media used to spread the word to possible interested parties			1
it has not yet been used to help the development of something as sizeable as an airline			0
but @entity54 , a former @entity56 banker , and the ceo of @entity16 , is confident that the money to make his dream reality can be found via this method			0
‘ by using an online crowd funding platform , we are offering an investment that is accessible to a large and diverse number of potential investors , ’ he says			2
prior example : @entity67 operated as a business - class - only airline between 2006 and 2008 @entity54 is using the crowd - funding website @entity71 ( crowdcube.com ) as his chosen portal			1
the project has already raised funds from other sources , and hopes to be in business within two years , offering a premium transatlantic service			0
mooted flight routes include @entity26 and @entity79 , with all services taking off from @entity19 airport , close to the @entity83 business hub in the east of the capital			0
@entity16 will reportedly use @entity87 c - series aircraft , with 40 fully - reclining flat - bed seats to cater to passengers travelling for business purposes			2
however , @entity16 will not be the first airline to aim solely at the suit - and - tie market			0
@entity93 ( @entity93 ) recently announced business - only flights between @entity95 , on @entity97 ’s west coast , and @entity98 in @entity99 – a service designed to appeal to executives needing to zip between these two oil - industry hotspots			2
and in february , @entity103 announced an exclusively business - class service between @entity105 and @entity106			1
flights are due to begin on 15 may			0
luxury in the skies : despite catering solely to business - class flyers , @entity67 ceased to trade in 2008 while investors will hope to see a profit on their money if they assist in the crowd - funding of @entity16 , they should perhaps also be wary of a recent precedent			1
@entity67 was a business - class - only airline , which flew out of @entity118 , and served @entity26 - @entity119 and @entity120 between 2006 and 2008			1
despite a positive start , the airline ran into economic turbulence as the financial crisis of 2008 took hold , and ceased trading after a mooted buy - out failed to come to pass .			0

@entity16 hopes to raise £ 5million via online crowd - funding website
this source of *revenue* has only been used to help fund smaller projects
airline hopes to offer business - class - only flights to @entity26 from 2016
