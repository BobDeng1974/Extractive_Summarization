by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 former @entity3 coach @entity2 has leapt to the defence of @entity6 's captaincy ahead of the upcoming @entity8 series against @entity9			1
@entity6 , who captains @entity3 's test and one - day sides , has endured a torrid 2014 with an @entity12 whitewash preceding recent series defeats by @entity14 in both formats			1
the 29 - year - old has also struggled badly with the bat but @entity2 , who resigned in january after the @entity12 , has told the @entity18 that @entity6 is still the right man for the job			1
under fire : @entity6 ( cenrte ) looks dejected after @entity3 somehow contrived to lose to @entity14 old allies : @entity6 and @entity2 watch on as @entity3 prepare for the ill - fated 2013 - 14 @entity12 campaign @entity2 said : ' it seems to be forgotten , and people should not forget , that this is a young man , a 29 - year - old man , who has done some extraordinary things for his country			1
' he has scored the most test centuries for his country â€“ that in itself is an amazing achievement , and he 's got so much more left to give			0
' @entity6 's captaincy had started so promisingly with @entity3 recording their first @entity34 win in @entity9 for 17 years back in december 2012			2
he flourished with the bat on the subcontinent and positive results continued into 2013 with the @entity39 man guiding @entity3 to a 3 - 0 @entity12 win over @entity41 last summer before it all turned sour			2
the main criticism labelled at @entity6 by the likes of @entity44 is a perceived lack of tactical awareness and cricketing nous in the field , but @entity2 cited the win in @entity9 as evidence to the contrary			2
found out : @entity52 celebrates clean - bowling @entity6 at @entity53 in december moving on : @entity2 opted to resign in the wake of the @entity12 defeat after four - and - a - half years in the job he said : ' he 's led the side to an astounding @entity8 victory in @entity9 , against the odds , and in the main on pitches which @entity3 have traditionally struggled on , and tactically he was excellent in @entity9			1
if he had n't been , we would not have won			0
' the five - @entity8 series against the @entity65 starts at @entity66 on thursday and @entity2 urged the @entity68 public to get behind @entity6 and his struggling side as they look to stop the rot			1
@entity2 said : ' he is an outstanding cricketer and we , the @entity68 public , should be proud of having @entity6 as one of our own , leading the test side			0
they should not be duped into thinking otherwise by those that have the platform to shout loudest			0
they should make their own judgment about a fine , proud @entity68 leading the @entity3 cricket team			0
' on to the next one : cook bats at @entity82 last week in preparation for the @entity9 series			0
