scientists have used light brighter than 10 billion suns to examine the cracks , fractures and breaks in the bones of a 150 million - year - old dinosaur			1
researchers said their groundbreaking work - using synchrotron - imaging techniques - sheds new light on the healing process that took place when these animals were still alive			2
the study took advantage of the fact that dinosaur bones occasionally preserve evidence of trauma , sickness and the subsequent signs of healing			1
giant meat - eating dinosaurs were a hard bunch capable of taking punishment as well as dishing it out , research suggests			0
scientists used synchrotron - generated x-rays to analyse the chemical structure of a foot bone from @entity31 , a two - legged carnivore that lived 150 million years ago to make the finding diagnosis of such fossils used to rely on the inspection of gnarled bones and healed fractures , often entailing slicing through a fossil to reveal its secrets			1
in another dino - study released today , an international team led by scientists at @entity44 and the @entity45 estimated the body mass of 426 dinosaur species based on the thickness of their leg bones			1
the team found that dinosaurs showed rapid rates of body size evolution shortly after they appeared around 220 million years ago			1
however , these soon slowed and only the evolutionary line leading to birds continued to change size at this rate			0
this continued to happen for 170 million years , producing new ecological diversity not seen in other larger dinosaurs			1
but the synchrotron - based imaging , which uses light brighter than 10 billion suns , meant the team could tease out the chemical ghosts lurking within the preserved dinosaur bones			1
the impact of massive trauma , they discovered , seemed to be shrugged off by many predatory dinosaurs			2
fossil bones often showed a multitude of healed injuries , for example , most of which would prove fatal to humans if not medically treated			1
dr @entity81 , one of the paper 's authors based in @entity85 's @entity84 , said : ' using synchrotron imaging , we were able to detect astoundingly dilute traces of chemical signatures that reveal not only the difference between normal and healed bone , but also how the damaged bone healed			2
' it seems dinosaurs evolved a splendid suite of defence mechanisms to help regulate the healing and repair of injuries			0
' the ability to diagnose such processes some 150 million years later might well shed new light on how we can use @entity104 chemistry in the @entity105			1
' the chemistry of life leaves clues throughout our bodies in the course of our lives that can help us diagnose , treat and heal a multitude of modern - day ailments			0
' it 's remarkable that the very same chemistry that initiates the healing of bone in humans also seems to have followed a similar pathway in dinosaurs			0
' this is an artist 's illustration of the @entity31 the scientists investigated			2
preserved dinosaur skeletons show signs of injury that the scientists were able to detect using state - of - the - art imaging techniques bone does not form scar tissue , unlike a scratch on the skin , so the body has to completely reform new bone following the same stages that occurred as the skeleton grew in the first place			1
this meant the researchers were able to tease out the chemistry of bone development through such pathological studies			0
' it 's exciting to realise how little we know about bone , even after hundreds of years of research , said co-author @entity146			0
' the fact that information on how our own skeleton works can be explored using a 150 - million - year - old dinosaur just shows how interlaced science can be			2
' professor @entity152 , another co-author from the @entity85 , added : ' it is a fine line when diagnosing which part of the fossil was emplaced after burial and what was original chemistry to the organism			0
' it is only through the precise measurements that we undertake at the @entity163 in the @entity164 and the @entity165 in the @entity166 that we were able to make such judgements			0
' the findings are published in the @entity170 journal @entity171 .			0

scientists used state - of - the - art techniques to study dinosaur bones
this *detailed* analysis revealed that the bones could heal easily
the discovery was made by analysing a foot bone from an @entity31
this was a two - legged carnivore that lived 150 million years ago
fossils were found with many healed injuries that would be fatal to humans
but the dinosaur was able to apparently shrug off even massive trauma
