a wet wednesday in @entity0 and @entity1 stirred in the face of what might prove to be among his toughest tasks of the week : summoning the right amount of enthusiasm while remaining polite about the world ’s worst international team			1
@entity1 set about it in brisk fashion , fixing a new target on the horizon for his @entity15 players to complete this qualification campaign with a perfect set of 10 wins			1
having emerged triumphant from the first and , on paper , the trickiest fixture , against @entity22 in @entity23 , why not ? reaching @entity24 is no longer much of an accomplishment for @entity15 and that is nobody ’s fault but @entity29 ’s			1
@entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 are planning a goal blitz @entity1 has set his sights on a perfect record from their @entity24 qualifiers @entity38 at @entity39 on thursday night will not present a problem			1
@entity41 in @entity42 on sunday is perhaps a little tougher but should not disturb the plan			2
‘ there are 10 qualifying matches , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ in the last 10 , we won six and drew four			0
it would be nice to go through this qualifying campaign unbeaten			0
if we get two good results , we ’ll set ourselves the target of winning all the games			2
’ @entity15 ’s qualification campaign for the @entity53 in @entity54 was about as unimpressive as a group - topping unbeaten campaign can be			1
of the six wins , four were against @entity38 and @entity58			1
@entity15 skipper @entity59 wants to break sir @entity61 's goal record @entity1 hopes @entity15 can continue their perfect start against @entity38 at @entity39 it was not until the final two games that a decent team were beaten , when @entity1 ’s side burst into life to finish with wins at home to @entity70 and @entity71			1
this time , the @entity15 boss would like more panache and there were signs of that in @entity23 last month , when @entity77 scored twice in a new system , with @entity32 playing at the top of a midfield diamond			1
the key will be to preserve that momentum over the next two games			2
‘ i ’m looking very much at the movement of our front players and midfielders , which is something we ’ve worked on for a long time , ’ said @entity1			1
@entity77 is expected to spearhead @entity15 's attack following his two - goal blast against @entity22 ‘ and for the same level of defensive commitment we showed against @entity22 in terms of winning the ball back quickly and sustaining attacks			1
‘ i ’d be disappointed if the pace of our play dropped enormously because we ’re getting a lot of the ball			0
i want us to put pressure on ourselves to keep the tempo up			0
‘ i know the players would like to do that			0
in football , things do n’t always work out the way you hope			0
but i ’m very confident that the players will want to give me and the country the performance i expect			0
’ @entity113 hopes @entity15 can use their @entity53 flop in @entity54 as a driving force @entity59 and @entity1 spoke to the press at their @entity0 base on wednesday he swerved the idea that nations with a pedigree as poor as @entity38 ’s , alongside @entity121 at the bottom of @entity124 ’s rankings , ought to face a pre-qualifying round to earn the right to play at this stage of the competition			1
‘ it ’s a question for @entity29 , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ but if they play the game properly , it ’s not such a bad thing that there ’s this discrepancy			0
’ the last time @entity38 ’s assortment of computer scientists , interior designers and two professional footballers appeared at @entity39 , they did not roll over quite as they were supposed to			1
they held out for more than half an hour before conceding from a penalty and goalkeeper @entity145 clobbered @entity146 , forcing him off inside 10 minutes and out of the next game in @entity71			0
@entity15 won 5 - 0 and it was more routine in @entity38 , when an own goal was the first of eight			1
@entity1 has urged his @entity15 troops to play at a high tempo against the part - timers on both occasions , it was the first game in a double - header and @entity1 changed six players for the more difficult second game , although neither of the difficult games in question was won			1
@entity1 reflected on his time in the @entity165 at @entity166 when he found those he rested from the competition were worse in the next game than those who had played			2
so , the @entity15 boss insisted there would be ‘ no wholesale changes ’ to the team which performed well in @entity22			1
even so , do not be surprised to see key men replaced after an hour			0
an injury to @entity177 means there will be at least one change , with @entity181 teenager @entity180 expected to start his first senior international			2
@entity183 , who sat out training on tuesday , was involved again on wednesday and is available			0
@entity38 trained at @entity39 on wednesday night ahead of the @entity186 qualifier ‘ we ’re keen to keep the momentum going , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it ’s important we ’re taking it seriously			0
everyone is anxious to play			0
the players deserve further confidence			0
we ’ve got to weigh the two things : keeping the team together but also using one of these games as a chance to see someone else play			2
‘ at management level you never work without fear and every game is important			0
i do n’t think any of us want a complacent life in football			0
‘ we want to test ourselves and set ourselves standards			0
i want this team to grow and to look back in two years ’ time saying , “ we ’ve come a long way ”			0
these two matches are important steps along the way			0
@entity210 ( left ) will be hoping to win his second @entity15 cap on thursday night ‘ the players need to continue showing they have this burning desire to play good football			1
’ there are also personal motivations , notably for @entity59 , who will win his 98th cap and hopefully move closer to sir @entity61 ’s goal record			2
and for @entity223 , if he starts , as well as @entity221 , who may win his first cap , and @entity210 , who may win his second .			2

three @entity226 got off to the perfect start with win in @entity22 last month
