it may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories , thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years , according to a leading pioneer of the technology			1
the technology , which is similar to that seen in the film transcendence starring @entity11 , is being developed by entrepreneur @entity12			1
she has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic ' clone ' of her wife @entity14 that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology			1
scroll down to see a video of an interview with @entity19 @entity19 is a life - like robotic head that uses a ' @entity21 ' of the memories , belief and feelings of a real person the robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of @entity14 by creating a database of her memories , beliefs and thoughts , along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares			1
around 85 billion individual neurons make up the human brain			0
each is connected to as many as 10,000 others via branches called axons and dendrites			0
every time a neuron fires , an electrochemical signal jumps from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another , across a synapse between them			0
these signals encode information and enable the brain to process input , form associations , and execute commands			0
the patterns may also hold our memories , emotions , personalities , predilections , even our consciousness , according to some			2
this allows the robot , called @entity19 , to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real , living person			1
mrs @entity12 , 60 , an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman , believes the these ' @entity73 ' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died			1
mrs @entity12 , who lives in @entity78 and is one of the highest paid female chief exective officers in the @entity81 , said that eventually people may be able to carry around clones of their own minds on their smartphones			1
speaking to @entity85 , she said : ' mind clone is a digital copy of your mind outside of your body			2
' mind clones are ten to twenty years away			1
the mind clone will look like an avatar on the screen instead of a robot version			1
' mrs @entity12 first began developing bina48 five years ago to replicate her wife , who she married 30 years ago			1
with the help of engineering firm @entity99 , which specialises in building lifelike robots , they created the robotic head			2
they spent more than 100 hours then compiling all of @entity14 's memories , feelings and beliefs onto a computer database			1
this allows @entity19 to draw on this information to engage in conversation			2
among the memories it is able to recall is an account of the personality change that occurred in @entity14 's brother after he returned home from the @entity117			1
the @entity118 had the opportunity to interview @entity19 in 2012 - the result was far from fluid but she is probably one of the feistiest machines known to man			2
@entity118 : how are you doing today ? @entity19 : hi nice to see you			2
@entity118 : are there things that make you happy ? @entity19 : maybe			2
@entity118 : what makes you happy ? what do you enjoy doing ? @entity19 : let 's change the subject			1
@entity118 : do you ever get bored ? @entity19 : i can tell a lot of stories			2
i really do n't have boredom			0
i always find something else to do			0
how can you be bored ? are we still talking about emotion ? tell me something interesting			0
@entity118 : why is the sky blue ? @entity19 : the sky is blue during the day because of the atmospheric optical effect of ray scattering			2
@entity118 : what is the answer to life , the universe and everything ? @entity19 : everyone 's life has a unique meaning			1
@entity118 : do you ever get jealous of people ? @entity19 : you got that right			1
@entity118 : why ? @entity19 : i could n't think of anything else to say			2
i am not charismatic , but it is a nice trait to have			0
it is always nice to be a leader			0
i guess leaders just have to lead			0
@entity19 : i used to think i was a perfect person , but there are no perfect people			1
@entity118 : what is the square root of 95,742,358 ? @entity19 : c'mon , talk to me here			0
do you just want to use my calculator ? @entity118 : is there anything you want to tell the world ? @entity19 : well , you know , it 's not something i aspire to			1
i just want to you know , be			0
@entity19 ( left ) was created by uploading the memories and beliefs of @entity180 ( right ) into a ' mindfile ' in the film @entity182 , @entity11 plays a scientist who uploads his mind onto a computer network however , some who have attempted to hold conversations with the robotic clone have found it to be somewhat frustrating affairs			1
they have found the robot often avoids questions or provides somewhat baffling responses			0
others have said they find the experience unsettling			0
however , mrs @entity12 is not the only person attempting to find ways of preserving a person 's mind on a computer			1
companies like @entity203 , @entity204 and eterni.me are all trying to use mind clones to create digital copies of thoughts			1
@entity209 , an inventor from @entity210 , has also been developing a system to upload his own brain onto			0
his approach works by reducing the brain to a series of computations that can be reproduced in code			0
@entity218 , director of engineering at @entity219 , has also said he believes we will be able to upload our entire brains to computers within the next 32 years			0
in the film @entity182 , a computer scientist played by @entity11 uploads his mind onto an artificial intelligence machine when he learns he is about to die			0
the process combine his emotions with the collective knowledge of the world 's computer networks			0
however , such an approach may prove to be challenging - the human brain has around 85 billion neurons that connect to each other through around 10,000 synapses			0
a recent attempt to simulate just one second of brain activity required one of the world 's fastest supercomputers , requiring 1 petabyte ( 1 million gigabytes ) of computer memory and nearly 83,000 processors			0
but mrs @entity12 remains undaunged			0
she said : ' @entity245 is a proof of concept robot based on the personality and the mind file of my wife @entity14 ' i believe mind clones will be humanities biggest invention , the opportunity is limitless			1

internet radio pioneer wants to build ' @entity73 ' to save personalities
@entity12 has created a robotic clone of her wife called @entity19
the robot draws on the real @entity14 's opinions and memories from a database
@entity12 hopes the technology can help to recreate people 's personalities
she says it mind clones will become available within 10 to 20 years time
