many say @entity2 's lyrics are unbeatable			1
that was before @entity4 had his way with them			2
in a preview clip from his new movie @entity9 , the 69 - year - old actor half mumbles along to @entity11 as he tries and fails to water a seemingly dead plant			1
and if social media is anything to go by , the rendition is certified genius			2
slowly , he plods through his movements - absent - mindedly watering a plant that then falls over , throwing away his cigarette before immediately lighting another			2
but all the way , he is trying to keep up with @entity2 's crooning , occasionally bursting out into song when he catches on a line he knows well			1
one fan commented on the video released by the @entity35 on @entity36 : ' it does n't get better than this - two legends at the same time ! ' another said : ' why do i love this ? i do n't know why i love this			0
please someone explain it to me			0
' and one exclaimed : ' bill you are the @entity47			0
' ' masterpiece ' : he half - mumbles , half - wails @entity2 's @entity50 in his movie @entity9 multi-tasker : the 69 - year - old seems completely at ease trying to water a seemingly dead plant while singing performance : it was all for the film but fans have taken the clip as yet another triumph for @entity4 known for being non-chalant and eccentric , this moment that he sees the plant pot fall seems typical @entity4 soon - to - be - released : @entity4 stars as a drunk gambler in @entity9 , which comes out on october 24 it is not the first time @entity4 has excited his fawning fans by turning something completely unremarkable into a work of art. earlier this year , he sidled into a couple 's engagement photos while on a walk in his hometown in @entity76 - sending the internet into some form of meltdown			1
that came after the twice - married actor gatecrashed a bachelor party with relationship advice , and weeks later turned up at an unwitting fan 's @entity84			1
it seems even his co-stars in @entity9 , released on october 24 , have attributed legendary status to the star			1
' if you get a glimpse , the party follows him , ' @entity90 , said at the @entity94 , which declared its second day @entity95			0
' he is such a joy to work with and every day on set felt like a party			0
' @entity4 has no agent or manager , and uses a 1 - 800 phone number and messaging service to field calls from producers and directors eager for his involvement in their projects			0
@entity108 , who also wrote the script for ' @entity9 , ' said he called the number dozens of times			1
luckily for him , @entity4 finally called back			0
ramp it up : @entity4 gave a more raucous performance on saturday at a karaoke night in @entity115 , @entity116 rocking it : he was accompanied by @entity118 and @entity120 's @entity119 at the @entity122 party ' i try not to write with someone in mind because if you do n't get them , it 's just depressing , ' he said			1
' but @entity129 's the perfect blend of bitter and sweet - and @entity130 , really			0
and once i started thinking of him , i could n't stop thinking of him			0
' the film tells the story of @entity9 - who drinks , gambles , and lives alone but has periodic visits with a pregnant @entity135 prostitute - and his unlikely friendship with the scrawny kid who moves in next door			1
after a rousing audience reception at the world premiere , reviews have been mixed , with the @entity142 saying that the crowd ' responded on pavlovian cue to the film 's cutesy , aging - rebel theatrics , but , really , @entity4 deserves a better movie			2
' yet @entity148 called the @entity35 movie a ' window into the actor 's own soul ' , which it describes as ' a ticket to movie heaven			2
' the @entity2 performance , sung along to a cassette player , is slightly more subdued than the high - octane karaoke performance @entity4 gave in @entity115 last night			1
accompanied by @entity120 drummer @entity119 , he treating golfers at @entity160 to a few roaring crowd - pleasers at a post-game party - while clad in cow - print trousers .			0
