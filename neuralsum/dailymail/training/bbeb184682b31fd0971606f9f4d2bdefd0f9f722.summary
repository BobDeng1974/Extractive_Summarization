by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 19:36 est , 31 december 2012 if you gave the dustmen a hefty tip this @entity4 because you feel guilty about the amount of rubbish you put out , you might want to take a leaf out of @entity9 ’s book			1
yesterday he celebrated achieving his goal of producing only one bag of refuse in an entire year			2
mr @entity9 has picked through his leftovers every day since last @entity15 , putting all his uneaten food on a compost heap in his garden			1
he does not eat meat or fish , and he grows his own salad and fruit to cut down on supermarket packaging			2
proud recycler @entity9 with his only bag of rubbish in 2012 , after he resolved to recycle or compost most of his waste the 60 - year - old also separates out his cardboard , paper , plastic bottles , glass and cans for weekly kerbside collections by the council – and because those items can then be recycled , they do n’t count towards his annual rubbish tally			1
he even travels from his home in @entity41 , @entity42 , to @entity43 and @entity44 to recycle margarine tubs and @entity47 juice cartons because he believes those cities have better recycling facilities			0
the single bin bag he has been left with after 365 days of living as possibly the greenest householder in @entity52 is full of plastic film packaging which he can not recycle and has been unable to find a use for in his home			1
mr @entity9 , who works as a self - employed environmental re-searcher , said yesterday : ‘ people ask , “ why on earth are you doing this ? ” back to the earth : @entity9 's resolution to compost waste meant that he was able to fill just one bag of rubbish for the year reaping the benefits : through careful recycling and composting , @entity9 has been able to grow his own fruit			1
the 60 - year - old says he understand it would be harder for larger households , but says @entity52 could improve its recycling habits @entity9 says far too many plastic bags are being wasted in @entity52 ‘ i just wondered , if you compost absolutely everything that will rot and recycle everything you can , what will you be left with ? ‘ i wanted to push myself to an extreme to see how far i could go			1
if you had six children and lots of disposable nappies it would be different			0
‘ but i ’m not doing this to score points off any other household in @entity42 , i ’m just asking what could we feasibly get our recycling rate up to			0
i ’d say that 80 to 90 per cent of all waste can be composted or recycled			1
at the moment in @entity52 it ’s about 30 per cent			0
‘ there are 52 weeks in the year and 400,000 households across @entity42 , so that ’s 20million plastic bin bags that are being produced , distributed , collected and burned each year			2
’ he added : ‘ recycling some things is not that easy in @entity42			0
i ’ve taken some things , like drink cartons , to the recycling centre but there ’s a difference between what ’s possible and what ’s convenient			0
’ @entity42 ’s recycling rate of 31.5 per cent puts it in the bottom quarter of councils nationwide in terms of recycling and waste management			2
@entity43 is one of the leading cities in the country , with a rate of around 50 per cent between april and june this year			0
according to figures released by the @entity116 , nearly 23million tons of household waste was generated over 2011/12 .			0

@entity9 composted or recycled most of his waste
single bag full of film packaging he has *crammed* into plastic bottles
recycler says he wanted to ' push himself '
