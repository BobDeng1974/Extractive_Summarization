by @entity0 the nurse whose appearance in @entity3 reports on the @entity5 famine sparked live aid has revealed she could not get rid of the tv crew fast enough			1
dame @entity8 spoke of her anguish at having to choose who would live and die in the disaster and said she objected to ' ridiculous ' questions from reporter @entity13			1
although she accepted mr @entity13 and his crew were doing ' what he needed to do ' , the humanitarian worker said : ' i could n't get rid of them fast enough '			1
' ridiculous ' : dame @entity8 said she wanted to get rid of the @entity3 crew which came to interview her during the @entity5 famine of 1984			1
she said her thinking was ' i do n't want these people around me ' heartbreaking : @entity13 's reports from @entity5 inspired people to give millions of pounds in food aid speaking to @entity27 's @entity28 , @entity29 said some of the hardest times in @entity5 were on ' selection days ' when she would have to choose who got fed. ' i can remember one day counting 10 rows of children and in each row there was over 100 children and i had 60 or 70 places , ' she said			2
' i thought " how on earth am i going to do this ? " we decided i would go up and down the lines and look at every child and put a little mark on them if i chose them			2
' we did n't choose the ones who were the worst because we knew they would die within a few days			2
i chose the ones with a spark of life in their eyes			0

i remember him asking me " so @entity65 , what 's it feel like choosing those who can live ? does it do anything to you ? " ' ridiculous			0
i mean , what do you expect ? it breaks my heart			0
and i just could n't get rid of them fast enough because i just thought this is ridiculous , i do n't want these people around me			1
' however , she agreed ' absolutely ' that @entity13 was doing ' what he needed to do ' to push the stark details of the famine into the public consciousness			0
when the first aid plane arrived thanks to the money raised because of the @entity3 reports , she said : ' it was this massive plane and it landed in a hail of stones and shingles and dust and they opened the back doors and it was just full of food			1
' i thought " wow - we 're saved "			0
' @entity100 : there had been famines before , but the scale and horror of that in @entity5 shocked the world the horiffic news reports from @entity5 - still regarded as some of the most powerful ever recorded - inspired a public campaign which culminated in millions of pounds being released through @entity111 's single @entity112 ? @entity13 went on to become the anchor of the @entity3 's evening news , while @entity29 - who said she wanted to be a nurse since she was bandaging her teddies - was honoured by the @entity117 and is now a lecturer at the @entity119			1
