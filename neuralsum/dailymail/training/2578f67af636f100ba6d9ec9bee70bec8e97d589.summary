by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:59 est , 16 october 2013 there are very few things more annoying than tucking into your breakfast only for an uninvited guest to turn up halfway through			1
and this fierce lion certainly made clear his irritation at an unwanted diner intruding on his pride 's feast			1
when a younger male was audacious enough to swim across a @entity16 lake to try and muscle in on a rival pride 's buffalo kill , his older rival was n't willing to give up a mouthful of food and lashed out to protect it			1
the stunning set of pictures was taken by wildlife photographer and safari tour guide @entity26			1
hands off ! a young lion is attacked by a member of a separate pride after attempting to muscle in on dinner hungry : a young male lion tentatively approaches a rival pack with half an eye on the buffalo they are eating brave : the young lion lies down and waits in the territory of the other pride while its rival lions look on ready to pounce : the younger lion calmly allows his larger rival to stalk up behind him as he lies waiting the member of the feasting pack attacked his younger rival as he brazenly sat by the side of the lake in rival territory			1
despite his initial bravery - he was outnumbered by the males in the rival pack - the lion was sent packing with his tail between his legs and still hungry			0
mr @entity26 , originally from south @entity59 , managed to capture the altercation between the two lions when he took an early morning trip out to @entity16 's @entity64 's @entity63 hoping to spot the pride eating breakfast			1
@entity26 said : ' picking up the sight of vultures dropping onto the ground in the distance , we headed towards them , hoping that perhaps the resident @entity73 had killed something the night before			1
' indeed they had - we quickly found all 19 of the pride feeding on a fresh buffalo carcass which they 'd killed just an hour earlier			2
' the pride are well known for preying on buffalo and they have many battle scars to show for it			2
' suddenly , while most were feeding , several of the pride stood up and stared intently across the river			2
we followed their gaze with binoculars and could n't see anything initially , but eventually resolved two male lions from a neighbouring pride walking along the top of the opposite river bank			2
ferocious : the two lions trade blows as the bigger of the two attacks what a shot : the stunning selection of images was taken by wildlife photographer and safari tour guide @entity26 , originally from @entity59 pot luck : @entity26 had taken an early morning trip out to @entity16 's @entity64 's @entity63 hoping to spot the pride eating breakfast age over youthful exuberance : the male from the larger pride eventually comes out on top and chases the other young male away he added : ' they appeared interested in the buffalo kill and the females feeding on it			1
' but they looked young and we assumed that they were aware of how unevenly matched they would be if they challenged the males with the large pride			2
' some of the pride began to call to affirm territorial claim and the young males on the opposite bank lay down , apparently thinking again about approaching			0
the pride on our side continued to feed			0
' soon enough though , one of the young males began to move again and descended the river bank and waded across the river towards us			0
' this drew considerable attention from the whole pride who stopped feeding and watched his approach carefully			0
at this point , the intruder was still 400m from the buffalo carcass			0
making his escape : the smaller lion makes a hasty retreat after being taught a lesson by his fierce older rival tour guide : the picture was taken by seasoned wildlife photographer @entity26 , pictured ' after reaching dry land , the youngster pranced along the bank , feigning indifference at the 19 pairs of eyes glowering at him			1
' mr @entity26 and the group of tourists were only about 20 metres away from the feasting pack when one lion broke away and confronted the unwelcome dinner guest			1
' one of the pride males started to walk towards him , but approaching from behind , apparently stalking the younger lion			0
' of course , the youngster was more than aware of his presence but chose to lie still			0
barely believing what we were seeing , the young male allowed the larger pride male to stalk right up to him , reacting only when the attacker was almost on top of him			0
' it was all over in about 10 seconds , but the photos show that it was not merely a ritual - the youngster was rolled on his back and the older male picked up some cuts on his face			0
