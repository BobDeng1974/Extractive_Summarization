what gets me is their lack of compassion			0

we got married in 1998 and went to @entity46 with @entity24 for our honeymoon , then a couple of years back we took the whole family to @entity46 again			1
' we have been loyal customers for a long time			0
i asked them to refund the full amount with a view to us rebooking the trip when - hopefully - @entity2 has recovered			2
' @entity24 said because they really cared they would assist the family in claiming the amount back on our holiday insurance , but they would n't be refunding us			2
' luxury : encore at @entity57 in @entity17 where @entity1 had booked a king suite for his wife 's birthday @entity62 trip : @entity1 saved up for months to be able to treat his wife to the luxury break splendour : the couple were destined to have the trip of a lifetime at the @entity17 hotel ' it was her 50th birthday so i had phoned up her work and arranged time off without her knowing			1
we have never flown upper class before			0
we 'd always looked at the people in upper class and thought - one day we will be there			2
' i 'd saved frantically for months and @entity2 had no idea			0

she 'd always wanted to go to @entity17			2
cancelled : @entity24 charged a fee of £ 2,300 to cancel the luxury break ' but then when i had to break the news , it was a case of ' this is what you could have had , but you have cancer , so we 're not going '			1
