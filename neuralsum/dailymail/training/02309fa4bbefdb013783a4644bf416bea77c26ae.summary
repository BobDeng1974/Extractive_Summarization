millions of adults suffer from anxiety disorders where their constant worrying affects their daily lives			2
now , scientists have identified the area of the brain that controls fear , offering hope of a treatment for such disorders			0
@entity12 researchers have described a ‘ circuit ’ that controls fearful memories and behaviour in the brains of mice , offering insight into how anxiety disorders may develop			1
@entity12 researchers have described a ‘ circuit ’ that controls fearful memories and behaviour			1
they found that @entity24 plays a role in learning and remembering fear , and that its neurons extend into the central amygdala ( all marked on the diagram )			1
disrupting the connection significantly impaired fear learning in mice associate professor @entity33 , who led the study at @entity35 ( @entity35 ) in @entity36 , said : ‘ in our previous work , we discovered that fear learning and memory are orchestrated by neurons in the central amygdala			1
’ it is thought it could be controlled by a cluster of neurons that form the @entity24 , or paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus			0
this region of the brain is extremely sensitive to stress , acting as a sensor for both psychological and physical tension			0
the researchers were interested in whether @entity24 plays a role in learning and remembering fear in mice			1
the finding could potentially help millions of adults suffering from anxiety disorders ( stock image ) professor @entity33 said : ‘ we found that the @entity24 is specifically activated as animals learn to fear or as they recall fear memories			1
’ the researchers found that neurons from the @entity24 extend deep into the central amygdala , and that disrupting the connection significantly impaired fear learning			1
they believe that because the link between the @entity24 and the central amygdala is a critical component of fear learning , drugs could be used to target it in a bid to treat anxiety disorders			1
building on the finding , the scientists examined data taken from people with post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity80 ) to identify chemical messengers that might connect the @entity24 and central amydala			0
they focused on a molecule called @entity84 that ’s been linked with anxiety disorders and is known to play an important role in stimulating the birth of new neurons , as well as new connections between neurons			2
previous studies have shown that patients with anxiety disorders have mutations in @entity84 , suggesting that it might have a role in fear learning and memory			2
using mice , the researchers investigated whether @entity84 plays a role in fear and affects the connection between the @entity24 and central amygdala			1
they found that the presence of @entity84 in the central amygdala activates the brain region ’s neurons , causing mice that had not been frightened , to react fearfully			2
it also caused the formation of long - term fearful memories , they said			0
professor @entity33 explained : ‘ we established that this is a regulatory circuit that controls fear in mice : @entity84 is the chemical messenger that allows the @entity24 to exert control over the central amygdala			1
’ he added : ‘ our work provides mechanistic insight into a novel circuit that controls fear in the brain , and provides a target for the future treatment of anxiety disorders			1
' a chemical compound found in popular curry ingredient turmeric , could help erase bad memories , a study claims a spice commonly used in curry could help erase bad memories , according to a study			0
@entity139 , a bright - yellow compound found in the root of the @entity143 spice turmeric , prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain , and also removed pre-existing fear memories , researchers found			0
it is hoped that the findings will help develop treatments for people suffering with psychological disorders			0
psychologists from @entity153 trained rats to become scared when they heard a particular sound			0
scientists assumed the creatures were frightened when they froze			0
hours later , when the same sound was played to the rats , those who had been given ordinary food froze			0
yet the rats fed the curcumin - rich diet did n’t freeze , suggesting their fearful memories had been erased			0
professor @entity166 , who led the study , said : ‘ this suggests that people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological disorders that are characterised by fearful memories may benefit substantially from a curcumin - enriched diet			2

researchers at @entity35 , @entity36 , have described a ‘ circuit ’ that controls fearful memories in the brains of mice
found that the @entity24 region plays a role in learning and remembering fear
its neurons extend into the central amygdala - another region
disrupting the connection significantly impaired fear learning in mice
@entity195 may one *day* lead to a treatment for anxiety disorders
