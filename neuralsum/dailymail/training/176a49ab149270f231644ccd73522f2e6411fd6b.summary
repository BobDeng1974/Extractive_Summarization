by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 21 june 2013 a couple who spent thousands of pounds on @entity2 have finally had a baby after conceiving naturally			1
@entity4 , 37 , and his wife @entity5 , 35 , tried for a baby for seven years and spent £ 20,000 on @entity2			1
all of the @entity2 attempts failed but mrs @entity4 finally conceived naturally after a short spell on the contraceptive pill			1
@entity5 and @entity11 conceived @entity12 naturally after spending £ 20,000 on failed @entity2			1
they believe that the contraceptive pill ' reset ' mrs @entity4 's hormones allowing her to conceive @entity12 was born in december but had to spend the first five months of his life in @entity18 @entity19 because he was born with his oesophagus unconnected to his stomach			1
mr @entity4 , a tutor at @entity21 , said : ‘ when we found out @entity5 was pregnant we were thrilled			1
but when we found out that the baby had a significant health problem it was a real blow			0
‘ but the hospital staff were incredible and prepared us for what might happen			0
’ mr @entity4 had been told years earlier that he would never have children because of treatment he had for a brain tumour			1
so , after seven years of trying to get pregnant the couple from @entity32 , in the @entity33 , finally decided to put baby plans on the back burner to plan their wedding , and have one last shot at @entity2 afterwards			2
mr @entity4 ( pictured with @entity12 ) was told that he would never be able to have children because of treatment he received for a brain tumour mrs @entity4 , already mother to @entity41 , and @entity42 , 14 , from a previous relationship , went on the pill to settle her hormones for six months			1
but just weeks after coming off it she conceived before she had a chance to try @entity2 again			1
she said : ‘ my body seems to think it ’s older than it is			0
my hormones are like a menopausal woman and it was making it difficult to get pregnant			0
‘ the doctors seemed to think that the pill has reset my body somehow and stabilised my hormones which were preventing me from conceiving			1
@entity12 ( pictured with his mother a few minutes after his birth ) was born with oesophageal atresia - a condition which meant that his stomach was not connected to his oesophagus - he had to have surgery at two - days - old ‘ if i had known i would have saved the money and gone on the pill years ago			1
’ she added : ‘ going through @entity2 put a huge strain on our relationship , and we even turned to counselling			2
‘ the guilt of not being able to give @entity4 a child almost tore us apart			2
’ three months before their wedding , the couple learnt that mr @entity4 ’s father had terminal leukaemia and had just weeks to live			1
@entity12 was conceived just as they were coming to terms with the news			1
immediately after his birth in december , @entity12 was rushed to @entity81 where he spent the first five months of his life			1
he was allowed to go home in may @entity12 did not feed properly in the womb meaning his mother 's stomach became so swollen with fluid that ligaments ripped off her ribcage ‘ my @entity90 was desperate for us to have a child			2
it was like it was his dying wish to give us a new life as he lost his , ’ said mr @entity4			1
however , the couple ’s struggle was far from over			0
at mrs @entity4 ’s 20 week scan doctors were unable to identify @entity12 ’s stomach			1
‘ it felt like our brief happiness had been taken away from us			0
we had been trying for so long , and it felt cruel			0
“ why us ? ” is what we were thinking , ’ said her husband			0
doctors told the parents - to - be that their baby was most probably going to be born with oesophageal atresia , where the oesophagus is not connected to the stomach , which would cause him long - term problems			1
mrs @entity4 says that going through @entity2 put a huge strain on the couple 's relationship and that if she had known the contraceptive pill could help she would have tried taking it years earlier they were prepared by medics for the fact that their baby might be born not breathing , and he would have to have an operation to determine the full extent of the problem			1
as @entity12 was not feeding in properly in the womb , his mother ’s stomach became so swollen with fluid that ligaments ripped off her ribcage			2
she said : ‘ in the weeks before @entity12 was born i was so uncomfortable i could barely walk			2
i could n’t sleep and could only cat - nap sitting up			0
at the same time as @entity12 was conceived , @entity4 and mrs @entity11 learnt that mr @entity4 's father , @entity132 ( right ) had terminal cancer			1
they believe that @entity12 was his parting gift to them the couple are now trying to raise money for the @entity139 at @entity81 where @entity12 was cared for ‘ when i went into the maternity ward i met a lady about to have twins and i was bigger than her			2
’ @entity12 was born at 37 weeks after just a two hour labour			2
oesophageal atresia is a congenital abnormality in which the oesophagus is not connected to the stomach			2
the exact cause is not known			0
the condition occurs in about one in every 3,000 babies			0
in more than 50 per cent of babies with oesophageal atresia there are also other abnormalities			0
the condition can often be diagnosed before the baby is born as it can mean the baby 's stomach can not be seen on the ultrasound scans			2
once the baby is born it may experience respiratory distress , choking , feeding difficulties and frothing from the mouth			0
@entity166 usually has to be carried out shortly after birth to enable the baby to feed normally			0
babies with the condition now have a 90 per cent survival rate			0
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ he was breathing when he arrived , so me and @entity174 were able to give him a cuddle before he was taken to @entity81			1
‘ seeing @entity4 cuddle him for the first time was magical			0
but we could n’t enjoy being a normal family yet			0
’ @entity12 spent five months in @entity81 but was finally allowed to go home at the end of may			2
the couple are now trying to raise money for the @entity139 at @entity81 where @entity12 was cared for			0
‘ the staff in the ward were angels , ’ mr @entity4 said			1
‘ there is no other word for them			0
the love , kindness and care they have shown to @entity12 and all of us as a family is incredible			0
‘ @entity12 had his first operation when he was just two - days - old and we were in bits - they held us together			1
’ he added : ‘ when we went to see him on christmas day the nurses had put a card next to his cot from him to us			0
it was so moving and meant so much to us			0
