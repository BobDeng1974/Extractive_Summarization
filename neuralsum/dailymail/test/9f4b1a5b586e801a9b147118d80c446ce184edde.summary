a @entity1 survivor who last week forgave a 93 - year - old former @entity2 officer - known as the ' bookkeeper of death ' - has angered her fellow plaintiffs by saying he should not be prosecuted			2
@entity8 , 81 , who publicly embraced @entity9 in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness , called for the prosecutions of former @entity2 officers to end			1
by doing so , she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs in the case who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in @entity21			1
she argued that any @entity41 still alive should instead come forward to speak publicly about what they did to help counter the threat of @entity45 deniers in @entity21			0
in response , her co-plaintiffs released a statement through their lawyers today saying : ' our clients would not comment here – who better than a survivor of @entity23 knows that everyone needs to find their own way to overcome their suffering – if mrs @entity8 did not repeatedly stage her ' forgiveness ' publicly			1
' the subject of this criminal procedure is not that mr @entity9 has done anything personally to @entity62 or any of the other co-plaintiffs			2
' whether it is mrs @entity8 's place to forgive mr @entity9 's participation in the murder of her relatives is up to everyone to decide for themselves			1
' but if mrs @entity8 says " these prosecutions must stop " then she should not have become a co-plaintiff			1
' the statement added : ' we can not forgive mr @entity9 his participation in the murder of our relatives and another 299,000 people – especially since he feels free from any legal guilt			2
' we want justice and we welcome the resolution that this trial brings			0
' justice : mrs @entity8 's co-plaintiffs said they could not forgive mr @entity9 for his participation in the murders in court in @entity86 last wednesday mrs @entity8 detailed how she and her twin sister @entity87 were forced to endure horrifying medical experiments at @entity23 by @entity25 , known as the ' @entity89 '			1
she told the hearing how they evaded being gassed on arrival at the death camp thanks to @entity25 's twisted obsession with twins			0
he experimented on twins in a sickening attempt to develop genetic techniques for @entity100 's dream of creating a ' pure ' aryan race			0
@entity25 used 1,500 sets of twins in his experiments , and only an estimated 180 to 250 individuals survived			0
despite her ordeal , mrs @entity8 found the compassion to forgive her @entity24 tormentors - and even unofficially adopted the grandson of @entity2 commander @entity109 , who oversaw the murder of more than 1 million people at @entity23			1
liberation : @entity23 survivors during the first hours of the concentration camp 's liberation in january 1945 chilling : a sign over the @entity23 camp reads ' @entity118 makes you free ' she spoke after giving evidence against the former @entity2 guard @entity9 for his alleged complicity in the murder of 300,000 @entity126 @entity34 prisoners at the death camp in the summer of 1944			1
as a qualified bookkeeper , it was his job to sort and store the @entity34 ' money that the @entity41 kept			2
after giving evidence , she approached and embraced @entity9 , but added : ' my forgiveness does not absolve the perpetrator from taking responsibility for his actions			1
neither does it diminish my need to know what happened there			0
' she claims @entity9 was so overwhelmed by her unexpected gesture that he fainted			2
asked why she had hugged him , she said it had not been planned and added : ' i wanted to thank him for having some human decency in accepting responsibility for what he has done			0
' i was always interested in meeting him face to face because i believe that there is a human interaction that i can not predict and no one else can predict			0
' she added : ' i do n't forget what they have done to me			0
but i am not a poor person – i am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the @entity41			0
' mrs @entity8 later tweeted : ' i met @entity9 , introduced myself reached to shake his hand - he grabbed my arm & fainted - i screamed 4 help			1
it was a strange reaction ! ! ' both mrs @entity8 's parents and two older sisters were killed at the camp			2
in 1984 she founded the organization candles ( an acronym for ' children of @entity167 ' ) , through which she located 122 other living @entity25 twins , as the experiment survivors came to be known .			0
