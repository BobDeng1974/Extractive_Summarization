the new season has n't even started yet , but @entity1 is already facing a pivotal few weeks			2
exactly how the manager goes about his business in the transfer market will shape @entity6 's campaign			2
with the club ready to sell prized asset @entity10 to @entity12 for a huge £ 80million , the @entity8 coffers will be bursting			1
@entity1 has already signed @entity20 from @entity21 for £ 4million			1
the @entity23 international has his qualities , but he is n't a like - for - like replacement for the @entity26			0
@entity27 has arrived from @entity28 for £ 9.75million - but the @entity30 under - 21 star is a box - to - box midfielder			2
@entity32 followed @entity20 from @entity33 's today in a deal understood to be worth £ 23million			1
@entity32 was fantastic for the @entity21 last season ; his call - up into @entity23 's @entity37 squad a reward for his excellent campaign			1
but on the biggest stage of all in @entity41 , @entity32 , like most of the squad , failed to make an impact as @entity23 crashed out at the first hurdle			0
comparisons : @entity46 went on a big spending spree when @entity48 was sold to @entity49 but none of the new players managed to fill the massive void left by the midfielder club record signing : @entity55 joined @entity56 from @entity57 for a fee of £ 26million big money arrival : @entity60 joined @entity56 from @entity61 in 2013 for a fee of around £ 17million the money is there at @entity8 - but @entity1 must spend it wisely			1
@entity1 must ensure that he does n't make the same mistakes @entity56 made in the transfer market last summer			0
the parallels between @entity6 and @entity56 are obvious			0
the £ 85million sale of @entity48 to @entity49 saw @entity46 and sporting director @entity70 embark on a huge spending spree that saw the club smash their transfer record three times			1
first , @entity60 arrived from @entity61 for £ 17million , then @entity55 for £ 26million from @entity75 and then @entity76 from @entity77 for £ 30million			0
from the three , @entity60 is the only signing that resembles any sort of value for money			0
when it came to the crunch , @entity56 , despite spending in - excess of £ 100million on fresh talent , were missing one vital component : @entity48			2
controversial : @entity10 has been linked with a move to @entity12 after being banned from football for four months after biting @entity88 during the @entity90 game between @entity91 and @entity92 when such quality leaves a football club , it 's nigh on impossible to replace			0
@entity1 will be mindful of that in his pursuit of trying to ensure @entity10 's pending departure to the @entity99 will not have a profound impact on his team			1
the @entity6 manager must decide whether to follow @entity56 ' example by trying to replace @entity10 with several signings designed to strengthen his squad as a whole , or to spend the majority of the cash on one ready - made world class replacement			1
it 's a tough call , but one that will shape @entity6 's season			2
@entity1 is interested in @entity113 forward @entity114 , who is viewed as one of the best emerging prospects in @entity119 football			0
new strike star : @entity20 joined @entity6 from @entity21 in £ 4million move new @entity6 signing : @entity32 enjoyed a good season with @entity21 but struggled to make an impact at the @entity37 @entity125 ' excited ' by signings @entity128 ’s @entity127 , who will play in midfield for @entity130 versus @entity131 later today , is also on @entity6 ’s wanted list while the club hope to add @entity135 ’s exciting forward @entity134			1
all three are under the age of 23 , suggesting @entity1 would be buying potential rather than proven quality			0
but whoever comes in at @entity8 this summer will be presented with a clear reference point of what is required			0
thirty - one goals and 19 assists			1
a tall order for one - or even four players .			0

@entity46 went on a huge spending spree after @entity48 's departure but failed to fill the void left by the star midfielder
@entity1 might be better off spending majority of his cash on one ready - made world class replacement .
@entity6 have so far *splashed* out £ 4m on @entity20 and £ 23m on @entity32 from @entity21
@entity10 scored 31 goals and had 19 assists last season
