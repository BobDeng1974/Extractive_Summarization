by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 14:39 est , 8 november 2012 a wartime @entity2 station control tower is to be converted into a bed and breakfast			2
the plan to transform the old @entity7 building in @entity8 is the brainchild of @entity10 and his wife @entity11			1
the @entity12 was built to command all the @entity14 take - offs and landings during @entity7			1
after the war it became offices , a workers ' mess room and flats , before spending the last 20 years as a home			1
back in time : the idea to transform the old second world war tower in @entity8 is the brainchild of @entity10 and his wife @entity11 nod to the past : the husband - and - wife team believe their transformation that will not only salute the tower 's heritage but share the story of its part in @entity35 's downfall the husband - and - wife team believe their transformation that will not only salute the tower 's heritage but share the story of its part in @entity35 's downfall with a present - day generation			1
' it is the world coming together for us , everything we wanted , ' said @entity10 university academic , @entity10 , who bought the property and moved in with @entity11 in october 2011			2
the couple who have one son , insist they are not modernising the place ' rather , they 're taking it back in time			2
' labour of love : the couple are creating a lounge - originally the air station 's meteorological and teleprinter room - resplendent with 1930s furnishings pieces of history : @entity11 found some of @entity64 's chaff - originally called window by the @entity66 , are tiny strips of tinfoil and were dropped by @entity70 bombers to ' chaff ' to jam enemy radar @entity14 opened on november 23 1943			1
seventeen aircraft were lost during operations from the airfield , eight @entity76 and nine @entity77			2
although proposed as a @entity80 airfield for future advanced aircraft these plans were dropped in the spring of 1944			2
the airfield ’s isolated location , however , made it perfect for the radio countermeasures work and bomber support carried out by squadrons of the @entity2 ’s new @entity88			2
in may 1944 no @entity89 flew @entity90 to confuse enemy radars by using ‘ @entity94 ’ jamming equipment which proved vital to the bomber offensive			0
on d - day the squadron played a crucial role by simulating a large collection of ships heading towards the @entity101 area , so drawing enemy forces away from the actual @entity70 invasion area in @entity104			1
the simulation was achieved through the flying formation which gave the impression of a large convoy , showing up as huge ships on enemy radar screens			0
‘ @entity111 was detached to form the nucleus of @entity113 in september 1944 , mainly using @entity114 for yet more countermeasures operations , also dropping ‘ window ’ tin foil strips to jam enemy radar			0
the airfield was later used by @entity120 to store and then scrap many @entity121 until closure in september 1947			0
source : airfields of @entity66 ' we want to respect it as a building and protect the authenticity of its history , ' said @entity10			0
they plan to offer @entity132 with three en suite rooms and have a tea garden in the grounds around the building with seating in the air raid shelter			0
by next summer they hope the work will be complete and they will be able show guests to their rooms in the old signal office or controller 's rest room			1
the couple are creating a lounge - originally the air station 's meteorological and teleprinter room - resplendent with 1930s furnishings			1
the bathrooms will be art deco , and guests will be able to choose what to have for breakfast on @entity158 - style menus and read daily postings of the @entity2 station 's operations schedules as they were in the days of 1944 - 45			1
but at the moment the couple are living in chaos with wallpaper partly torn off walls , half - finished floors , paint jobs waiting to be finished and piles of clutter			1
' at the moment , it 's at its worst , ' said @entity10			0
but @entity11 said : ' we are really fired up for the whole thing			0
we 've got well used by now to the cold and the grit and the dust all over the place			0
' corroded and weathered railings surround the balcony from where airmen once gazed out across yawning runways , awaiting the return of crews of @entity76 and @entity77 aircraft from their special missions to confuse @entity35 's @entity187			0
@entity10 , who works at @entity188 , grew up in an aviation - orientated family - both his grandad and dad had worked for @entity192 , the latter on @entity194			1
they couple plan to remove the post-war alterations - shingles , its pitched roof , various sheds from the woodyard days			1
even its contemporary kitchen will go eventually , to be replaced by a 1950s - style version with metal and @entity207 fittings			1
while they were clearing out , @entity11 found some of @entity64 's chaff under the concrete yard			0
history : an old air raid shelter on the land which could hold 50 people at a squeeze @entity217 , originally called window by the @entity66 , are tiny strips of tinfoil and were dropped by @entity70 bombers to ' chaff ' to jam enemy radar			0
it could also be used to signal distress by an aircraft when communications are not functional - it has the same effect as an @entity230 , and can be picked up on radar when it is dropped every two minutes			1
the steps to the upper floor have been re-fabricated and the brick walls will have a smooth , authentic rendering once again and those observation balcony rails will be restored as well as they can be			0
back - up : no @entity89 flew @entity90 from @entity14 airfield to confuse enemy radars by using ' @entity94 ' jamming equipment which proved vital to the bomber offensive functioning : @entity14 opened on november 23 1943			1
although proposed as a @entity80 airfield for future advanced aircraft these plans were dropped in the spring of 1944 locator : a map shows the disused airfield on the right ' anything that is n't skilled labour , we are trying to do ourselves , ' said @entity10 , whose grounds maintenance skills from his past career are coming in handy with the landscaping			2
the isolated farmland setting , fringed by the @entity257 , was used first as a decoy site by the air force			0
but then building work started on a heavy bomber base , called @entity262 complete with three intersecting runways , a control tower , technical and administration sites and quarters for more than 3,000 servicemen and women			0
congratulations : a letter sent to @entity14 @entity2 station praising them for their efforts the night before in putting out radar targets in due course , @entity88 of @entity276 used the station to employ counter-measures to disrupt the @entity281 ' electronic and radio communications			1
in peacetime , @entity283 planes - the wooden wonders - were stored there for a while but the runways were largely broken up			2
some aerodrome buildings survived , though , to become civilian homes , a woodyard , part of a feed mill and agricultural sheds			0

the @entity12 was built to command all the @entity14 take - offs and landings during @entity7
post-war it became offices , a workers ' mess room and flats , before becoming a home for the past 20 years
