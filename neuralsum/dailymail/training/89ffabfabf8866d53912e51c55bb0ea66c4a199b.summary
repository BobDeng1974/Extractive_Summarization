@entity1 's voters gave a grudging seal of approval to an @entity5 treaty that paves the way for further austerity measures across the continent in a desperate attempt to fight the debt - crisis that threatens the existence of the euro			1
the treaty 's approval , to be declared officially later today , relieves some pressure on @entity5 financial chiefs as they battle to contain the eurozone 's debt crisis			1
but critics said the tougher deficit rules would do nothing to stimulate desperately needed growth in bailed - out @entity1 , @entity24 and @entity25 nor stop @entity26 or @entity27 from requiring aid too			1
result : @entity1 's voters have given their seal of approval to the @entity5 's deficit - fighting treaty tense : a @entity33 campaigner watches the counting of votes in the @entity36 in @entity37 around 60 per cent of those polled are believed to have backed the austerity plans			1
the first constituencies to return a result were @entity42 and @entity43			2
they declared an overall 62 per cent majority in favour as campaigners on both sides accepted victory for the @entity33 campaign			2
@entity1 prime minister @entity51 said his government was relieved that voters have approved the @entity5 's deficit - fighting treaty , and now must work with @entity5 partners to build a plan to boost growth prospects across the debt - battered eurozone			1
@entity1 's @entity61 leader @entity60 , who opposed the treaty , said : ' the ' yes ' side is going to win			1
' the question now is where will the jobs and the stability they have promised come from , against the backdrop of a continuing and deepening capitalist crisis within @entity71 ? their policies will only make the situation worse			1
' dozens of party activists monitoring the ballot counting at several centres across @entity1 reported the ' yes ' side solidly outpolling ' no ' voters several hours ahead of the official result announcement at @entity82			2
holy vote : a @entity85 nun casts her vote at the @entity88 polling station in the referendum on the @entity71 fiscal treaty in @entity37 yesterday the activists , called ' tallymen ' , stood near official ballot - counters and made their own calculations			1
a strong majority of districts reported pro-treaty majorities , with the ' yes ' side polling between 55 per cent and 75 per cent in largely middle - class suburban areas of @entity37 , home to a third of @entity1 's 4.5million people			2
@entity103 unemployment has hit a record high and job losses are likely to keep climbing as the debt crisis eats away at businesses ' ability to hire workers while indebted governments continue to cut staff			1
around 17.4million people were out of work in the 17 - nation eurozone in april ( 11 % of the working population ) - the highest level since records began in 1995 , the @entity5 's statistics office @entity111 said today			1
' this 11 % level is going to continue edging up in the coming months and probably until the end of the year , ' said @entity120 , an economist at @entity121 who sees the eurozone 's economy contracting 0.1 % this year			1
' the economic activity situation tells you the story of the labour market			0
there 's been basically no economic growth since the fourth quarter of last year and indicators are pointing to very weak growth momentum for the second quarter , ' he said			0
@entity135 economist @entity134 said he sees the unemployment rate reaching slightly above 11.5 % if the economy starts to recover later this year			1
but if the downturn worsens , ' the risk is for an even higher peak in unemployment , ' he said			0
as the debt crisis intensifies , companies in the euro zone are trying to keep their labour costs low as they struggle with falling demand and profits , while a @entity149 - led drive to cut deficits and debt is pressuring governments to shrink spending			1
but some economists say austerity policies in an economic downturn are self - defeating because governments receive less tax receipts as unemployment grows and must pay out more money in jobless benefits			0
the anti-treaty vote was strongest in urban working - class districts where anger over the crippling cost of @entity1 's bank - bailout program runs highest			0
but even there , tallymen reported , the votes were splitting nearly evenly			0
unofficial vote tallies from rich and poor parts of @entity37 and @entity170 , the second - largest city , illustrated a stark class divide in how @entity1 voted			0
the @entity174 and @entity37 @entity175 districts , with swathes of run - down public housing blocks , voted 51 per cent against the treaty			1
but on the prosperous south side , the suburban port of @entity180 voted 72 per cent for the treaty , @entity183 66 per cent in favor			2
significantly , turnout was much higher in more affluent districts			2
overall , about half of @entity1 's 3.13million registered voters participated in yesterday 's referendum , typical in an officially neutral country that is constitutionally required to hold a referendum on each @entity71 treaty			2
public rejection could have blocked @entity1 from receiving new @entity5 loans once its 2010 bailout money runs out next year			1
it also would have sent political shockwaves through other eurozone members , where anger against austerity and bank bailouts runs similarly high but citizens are denied the chance to vote on the treaty			1
@entity1 is the only country that will put the fiscal treaty - a @entity149 - led plan for stricter budget rules - to a referendum			2
the treaty needs the approval of only 12 of the 17 euro zone countries to be ratified , but an @entity1 rejection would have undermined one of @entity71 's key initiatives just as problems mount in @entity26 and @entity25			1
analysts said that a ' yes ' vote would give @entity1 a better chance of getting back to bond markets as planned next year and hand @entity71 a rare piece of good news , though one it will have little time to bask in with more to worry about elsewhere			0
' i do n't think there will be much market reaction this morning , simply because it 's in line with expectations that were built up because of the polls , ' said @entity231 , chief economist at @entity232			0
' it is a message of support from @entity1 to @entity71 , i think that 's very simply what it is			0
policymakers wo n't have long to celebrate because there are wider issues in the euro area that they now must move their attention onto			0
' @entity1 two - year bond yields were higher on the day at a near five - month high of 7.53 per cent , meaning short - term borrowing costs still remained above those on longer - term bonds , a sign that investors are pricing in the possibility that @entity37 will need a second bailout			0
in a sign of the modicum of stability that has returned to @entity1 's economy , data showed on thursday that deposits held by @entity1 's domestic banks rose to a 14 - month high in april			0
that was in sharp contrast to @entity26 where depositors worried about their banks moved money abroad at the fastest rate since records began , recalling the tens of billions of euros that flew out of @entity1 ahead of its bailout			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity51 , who campaigned with warnings that @entity1 would face harsher austerity if it rejected the treaty , offered a cautious welcome for the early results and declined to declare victory			2
' i 'm hopeful for a strong ' yes ' vote			0
the early trends would indicate a strong run in favor of the ` yes ' vote			0
we 'll wait to see what the trends are around the country , ' said @entity51			0
he rose to power 14 months ago on a platform promising to pull @entity1 out of recession , minimise the cost of bank rescues , and getting the country borrowing normally again on bond markets by next year			0
the treaty , signed in february by leaders of 25 countries including @entity1 , proposes that all members who ratify it should reduce their annual deficits to no more than 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product			1
the current eurozone limit is 3 per cent			0
@entity1 , already four years into a brutal austerity program that has slashed around 15 per cent from many workers ' incomes , is committed to reaching the 3 per cent threshold by 2015			0
opponents of the treaty argued that the tougher new deficit rule would force @entity1 to stay on the austerity road until 2020 at least			1
@entity1 has posted the @entity5 's worst deficits since 2009 , including an @entity5 - record 32.4 per cent in 2010 and 13.1 per cent last year			1
both figures were greatly inflated by the exceptional costs of @entity1 's decision to nationalise five of its six banks rather than see any collapse - a debt burn that pushed @entity1 itself to the brink of bankruptcy in 2010			2
repayments to international bondholders , central banks and interest on decades - long loans are expected to cost @entity1 's taxpayers € 68billion , equivalent to € 19,000 for every man , woman and child .			0

low turnout relieves pressure on @entity5 bosses battling to contain debt crisis
