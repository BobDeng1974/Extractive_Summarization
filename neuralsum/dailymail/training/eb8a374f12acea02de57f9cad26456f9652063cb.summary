@entity0 have vowed to safeguard @entity2 ’s long - term health as they seek urgent specialist advice for the @entity5 lock after the latest in a worrying series of concussion setbacks			1
the 30 - year - old was helped off during the second half of his club ’s record 45 - 0 defeat at @entity12 on saturday having apparently suffered another damaging blow to the head			1
the @entity0 have concerns and doubts about his future playing prospects , but the player ’s personal welfare is undoubtedly their priority			2
@entity0 are having fears over @entity2 's career after suffering from multiple concussions @entity0 's @entity25 , aged 30 , has had ongoing issues with concussion @entity2 has suffered head trauma several times in the past year and this latest episode comes just weeks after a similar injury in a pre-season match against @entity33			1
concussion has become a huge issue for rugby and many other sports and @entity0 are not going to take any chances , despite the prospect of losing an experienced @entity40 , who started two of @entity5 ’s @entity43 in @entity44 in june , for an indeterminate period			2
@entity0 director rugby @entity46 said : ‘ he got concussed in @entity33 , had three weeks off , played against @entity49 , was good , then played against @entity50 and got a bang on the head again versus @entity12 , so that ’s two concussions in three games			1
‘ we ’re waiting for advice from the specialist but he wo n’t be fit this week and he may need some down - time because he ’s had consecutive concussions very quickly and clearly that ’s not healthy			1
‘ it is a concern for his health			2
he had a concussion in the @entity64 , he had a concussion at the end of the season and now he ’s had two in very quick succession in pre-season and at the start of the season			2
the bigger picture is @entity2 ’s well - being more than playing			1
’ asked if there are any fears that @entity25 may not be able to carry on playing , @entity46 added : ‘ i do n’t know the answer to that			0
you would like to think that with the right rest and expertise , he will be fine , but i do n’t know			0
‘ he is doing the usual cognition protocols and everything else they do			0
he ’s going to see the right people			0
he came in yesterday and feels ok in himself but for all the right reasons we have to go through all the right protocols			0
i do n’t want any of our players out there with potential brain injuries from concussions or whatever it may be because that ’s not right			1
‘ i need @entity2 on the field but not to the detriment of his long - term health			1
if he needs a few weeks because that ’s the right thing to do to get over this problem then we need to do that			0
there are some times when it ’s only a game			0
’ concussion has been the subject of increased awareness and improving medical procedures since @entity113 flanker @entity112 ’s swift return to the field against the @entity114 last summer — following a clash of heads with @entity117 — exposed concerns about the management of head injuries			1
several years ago , @entity44 captain @entity121 was able to downplay his own repeat concussion problems , but now all cases are being treated with due care and caution			0
@entity126 will be out for the next three months after undergoing shoulder surgery @entity128 will not be fit to face @entity44 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity113 in november the uncertainty over @entity2 ’s health and hopes of making a comeback have added to @entity0 ’s injury crisis			1
@entity46 is without a multitude of leading players and yesterday he revealed that @entity126 will join the mounting casualty list			1
the @entity5 hooker is expected to be out until @entity140 after having surgery on the shoulder he damaged in the drubbing at the @entity144 ‘ @entity126 has popped his @entity146 joint and has had surgery on it yesterday , ’ said @entity46			1
‘ he is probably going to be out for three months			1
he carried the ball , @entity149 fell on him , he just got caught awkwardly and his @entity146 popped out			0
‘ when you get separation between that and your shoulder joint , it has to be fixed			0
the collarbone just pops out at the top			0
if it ’s stable , it just needs rest but if it ’s a bit unstable then they wire it so it stays in position			0
it heals over time … three months ’ time			2
‘ it ’s disappointing because @entity166 is a world - class player and he gives you great impact either off the bench or starting			0
we ’ve already got three front - rowers missing and now @entity166 is out too			0
’ the @entity0 were also without @entity172 last weekend but hope the @entity5 centre will be fit to return from a groin strain against @entity175 at @entity176 on october 4			1
the @entity178 ’s revised directives , headed ‘ recognise and remove ’ , list the symptoms of concussion as ‘ convulsive , headache , knocked out , nauseous , unsteady , confused , dazed , dizzy ’ followed by the clear message : ‘ any of these — get them off now			0
’ the full @entity178 guidance suggests these ‘ six rs ’ : ‘ recognise , remove , refer , rest , recover , return			2
’ all players diagnosed with concussion by ‘ an appropriately qualified person ’ must be removed from the field of play and not return to play or train on the same day , and complete the graduated return to play protocol .			2

@entity2 has suffered two concussions in three games
@entity126 set to miss the next three months following surgery
@entity172 set to return from injury on october 4
