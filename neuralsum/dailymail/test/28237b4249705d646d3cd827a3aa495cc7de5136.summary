@entity0 last night repeatedly refused to admit he had got it wrong over the past five years about jobs , crime and the effect of tuition fees			1
@entity6 has previously confidently predicted that the @entity8 's austerity programme would see unemployment and crime soar , and the number of poor students going to university fall			2

' and he gave the strongest indication yet that @entity58 would be chancellor in a @entity6 - led government			2
mr @entity25 brought up the subject of mr @entity58 ' comment four years ago that it was ' fantasy ' to think @entity62 would get job growth with all the cuts being made in the public sector			1
he asked the @entity6 leader : ' what 's happened to jobs over the last five years ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' what @entity58 was doing was quoting what the @entity69 were saying , which is there 'd be a very , very big impact on public sector jobs , and there were deep questions about whether the private sector jobs could make up the shortfall			1
' the @entity43 presenter challenged mr @entity0 on jobs , crimes and fees - but the @entity6 leader refused to admit he had got it wrong on each occasion in the interview , mr @entity0 refused to say how much @entity6 would be borrowing by the end of the next parliament when mr @entity25 said he wanted to ' focus on the number of jobs ' , mr @entity0 had to admit : ' the number of jobs has gone up , but you know , i 'm going to let people in this election make the judgment about whether that means the economy 's fixed or not			1
' mr @entity25 interjected : ' it 's gone up by two million , has n't it ? about a thousand a day			1
' the presenter then moved on to crime ; quoting shadow home secretary @entity102 who said earlier this @entity51 that the cuts are ' risking public safety and the fight against crime '			0
when asked what had happened to crime , mr @entity0 at first answered : ' violent crime 's actually up			1
so there are worries about violent crime			0
and there are big questions about what 's going to happen to policing in the next parliament			0
' mr @entity25 then asked him twice : ' what 's happened to crime overall ? ' , forcing mr @entity0 to reply : ' you 're definitely right that there are a number of statistics that the government cites to say everything 's fine in the country and everything 's doing well			1
certain areas of crime have gone down ; certain areas of crime have gone up			0
but let 's go to the big argument of this election			0
' mr @entity0 gave the strongest indication yet that @entity58 would be chancellor in a @entity6 - led government @entity135 said he believed one in seven company directors should be from ethnic minority backgrounds – reflecting the population			1

mr @entity25 then moved on to the rise in tuition fees , quoting @entity135 saying in 2010 : ' how can these proposals do other than deter people from poor backgrounds from going to university ?

and that is n't good enough for me and the country			0
' after the @entity6 leader declined twice to say what had actually happened to rates of enrolment from poorer students , mr @entity25 told him the number had in fact increased by around a third			1
mr @entity0 replied : ' there are some more people going to university from different backgrounds			2
so the problem 's fixed is it ? ' asked : ' the judgment that was made was wrong ? ' , he replied : ' no , it was n't wrong			0
it is n't good enough for me that you 're 12 times more likely to get to university from an advantaged compared to a disadvantaged background			0
' mr @entity25 asked : ' so on issues about jobs , crime , social mobility , comments , predictions made by people in your team turn out to have been wrong			1
