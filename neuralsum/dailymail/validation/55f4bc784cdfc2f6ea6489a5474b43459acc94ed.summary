' growing up as a volleyball player around here , i know how gym space had become more and more limited , ' may - @entity0 said			2
' this is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports , too			0
with the amount of sports and teams we have here , it ’s important to have a facility like this			0
