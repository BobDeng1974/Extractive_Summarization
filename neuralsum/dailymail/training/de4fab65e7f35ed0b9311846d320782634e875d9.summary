by @entity0 selling a house usually means spending thousands on estate agent fees			0
but @entity4 and @entity5 managed thanks to their two young children making an @entity9 leaflet with a drawing and a handwritten note asking potential buyers to call their dad			0
astonishingly the homemade flyers , solely designed and distributed by eight - year - old @entity15 and @entity16 , six , led to a sale in less than a week			1
@entity18 and @entity5 , from @entity19 , sold their £ 250,000 house in just six days after their two eldest children , @entity15 ( centre left ) and @entity16 ( centre right ) made flyers featuring a sketch of the property and ' daddy 's ' number @entity15 , eight , and her six - year - old brother @entity16 made the flyers after finding out about the move , then posted them door - to - door and handed them out at a bring - and - buy sale the leaflet , coloured in with felt tip , asks that if the person reading it knows anybody who wants to buy a new house , then phone them up and say there is one in @entity44 for sale			1
the unprompted sales technique has saved a grateful mr and mrs @entity5 some £ 4,500 in estate agent fees – and boosted their chances of securing the £ 400,000 five - bedroom dream home they hope to buy			1
the couple had put in an offer but were worried the move would be jeopardised by waiting to sell their four - bedroom terraced house			2
after being told the situation @entity15 and @entity16 decided to make 40 leaflets which they distributed door to door to neighbours in @entity63 , @entity64 , and at a bring - and - buy sale			1
they also put a cardboard box outside their house for people to leave contact details			1
within four days @entity47 and mrs @entity5 had two offers for the full £ 250,000 asking price			2
thanks to the childrens ' flyers ( right ) , @entity18 and @entity5 saved themselves £ 4,500 in estate agent fees the children even made a ' @entity79 ' sign , rating the house at five stars and listing ' places in the house '			1
they also made a cardboard letter - box for buyers to put their contact details into two days later , without an estate agent in sight , a sale was agreed , and the family are looking forward to moving into their new house in the town by the end of the month			1
mrs @entity5 , 32 , who also has a two - year - old son @entity95 with her financial adviser husband , 47 , said : ‘ i think as adults we are too shy to be quite as bold , but not the children and it paid off			0
’ the mini estate agents were treated to a meal out as a reward			0
@entity15 said : ‘ it was great when two people wanted to buy our house			0
’ @entity16 added : ‘ we spent an hour making everything			0
i might be an estate agent one day			0
’ one of the leaflets was handed to a couple at the bring - and - buy sale who passed it to friends at church who were desperate to buy a home in the area near their daughter			1
the retired couple arranged a viewing - just hours before another hopeful left his contact details in the homemade box - and fell in love with the property			2
after just four days of handing out the leaflets @entity18 and @entity5 recieved two offers for the full £ 250,000 asking price for their three - bed home in @entity63 ( pictured ) the family are now looking forward to moving into this £ 400,000 , five - bedroom house across town - which will allow @entity15 , @entity16 , and their two - year - old brother @entity95 , to have their own rooms for the first time they immediately put in an offer which was accepted by @entity5 and @entity4 , 47 , a financial adviser			1
the new buyers , who wanted to remain anonymous , said : ' our friends were so impressed with the politeness and sweetness of the two children			0
' the next day she gave us the leaflet at church and we were impressed by it too			0
the rest , they say , is history			0
' as well as saving their parents time , the enterprising children have also saved £ 4,500 in estate agency fees - 1.5 per cent of the sale price plus 20 per cent vat .			2

@entity18 and @entity158 made an offer on a new £ 400,000 home in *january*

@entity15 , eight , and @entity16 , six , *included* a sketch and ' daddy 's ' phone number
