former @entity1 skipper @entity0 has been sacked by @entity2 after less than seven months in charge of the @entity5 outfit			1
the @entity7 club were relegated to the @entity8 – the second tier of @entity13 football – after an atrocious run of results culminated in them losing a relegation - promotion play - off with @entity15			1
@entity2 chairman @entity16 and chief executive @entity17 met with @entity0 on monday , with the board then unanimously agreeing to dispense with his services today			1
gone : former @entity1 skipper @entity0 has been sacked following @entity2 ' relegation to the championship @entity17 said : ' i have to say that we all regret that this decision had to be made , but during conversation it became clear that a different approach was needed			1
' sadly , for a variety of reasons and perhaps including unfortunate timing , it has n't worked out for @entity0 here			0
that is disappointing for all concerned			0
i am genuinely saddened that we have had to take this tough decision			0
' it may have taken longer than we all would have liked but i felt it was appropriate that we met properly and had a full discussion before any decision was made			0
' now we need to move forward and act to bring in a new manager with the aim of getting us promoted back to where @entity2 belongs , in the top league of @entity13 football , from a uniquely competitive championship			2
moving on : @entity2 will now bid to find a successor to @entity0 who was sacked after just seven months in charge ' our first aim must be to try to win the league and gain promotion automatically			1
' the search now begins to find and appoint the next manager , and while we will try to keep supporters updated regarding the process as much as we can , i know they will understand that we need to be professional in all that we do			0
' unfortunately , assistant manager @entity54 is abroad on holiday at present and i want to meet him on his return to explain the situation at the club			0
' @entity2 ' promotion back to the @entity60 is far from guaranteed next term with city rivals @entity62 also relegated this season and fallen giants @entity64 promoted to the @entity8 after winning the @entity66 title .			2
