when @entity1 wanted tips on portraying an astronaut for upcoming space thriller gravity she went to the highest possible authority – an astronaut floating over 200 miles above the @entity7 in the @entity8			1
the @entity11 star ’s tips came from veteran @entity13 astronaut @entity12 , who ’s logged more than 4,330 hours in space aboard the @entity15 and the @entity8			1
the astronaut is a fan of @entity1 and had been watching her in @entity17 while running on the station ’s treadmill when she found out that the actress wanted a chat - but she does n’t reveal if she was star - struck by her subsequent encounter			0
@entity33 ’s conversation with @entity1 came about completely by chance as the astronaut was nearing the end of her five - month stay aboard the space station in 2011 and @entity1 was about to begin filming			1
‘ it was through my younger brother who 's in the innovative wine packaging business , ’ @entity33 told @entity34			2
‘ he met @entity1 's sister , who is a chef			2
’ @entity1 ’s sister asked if @entity12 would dispense some expert advice and a phone call was eventually set up – but it had to come from the @entity54 , as only officials are allowed to make calls from @entity7			1
in @entity29 , directed by @entity57 and also starring @entity58 , @entity1 plays scientist dr @entity59 , whose spacewalk in the heavens turns hellish when debris from a @entity64 satellite smashes into the @entity65 and she ’s sent spinning into the void , detached from her tether			0
@entity1 speaks onstage at a @entity29 press conference during the 2013 @entity69 in a video created to explain the effects of weightlessness , @entity70 used one strand of her own hair to send herself tumbling away from a wall of the @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity33 would n’t be qualified to talk about the terror of floating off into space , as luckily she ’s never experienced it			1
but she was able to field @entity1 ’s questions about how it feels to be an astronaut			0
she told @entity34 : ‘ she wanted to know about what it is like to physically live up there and physically move around			0
“ what would you do with your hands ? with your feet ? what would be a natural position to work ? how often do you see your crewmates ? where do you meet each other ? " it was those kinds of things			0
’ @entity33 has seen the trailer to @entity29 and describes the scene where dr @entity59 is sent spinning into the void as sensationalism , but admitted to @entity34 that the film is valuable as it portrays ' real people , including women , doing a difficult job ' .			0

the tips came from @entity12 , who 's logged over 4,000 hours in space
