but with today ’s hectic pace of life it can be difficult to find the time			0
now an @entity14 company has come up with what it claims is the solution – exercise while you work			1
@entity1 , as it is known , is a desk that fits over a treadmill , enabling users to walk slowly while they work			1
the manufacturer claims the height - adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health , reduce stress , prevent disease and strengthen muscles			1
working at the @entity1 is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours			1
incredibly , it also claims to boost mood and productivity – although it remains hard to fathom how productive typing while walking would be			2
a statement on the company ’s website says : ‘ in fact , many studies have shown that your concentration and productivity will increase walking with a treadmill desk			1
' you will notice immediately that you do not suffer from the daily bouts of fatigue that may plague you after lunch and later in the day			2
increased blood flow to the brain also keeps you sharp and attentive			0
’ despite the possible difficulty of such multi-tasking , it adds : ‘ there is a distinction between a workout at work involving slow movement with a @entity65 desk and what people normally associate with exercise at a gym			1
’ the desk , which costs £ 300 , is designed to fit over any treadmill and measures 72x34inches			2
it also features a manuscript holder , allowing you to read books , magazines or manuscripts while you type , talk and walk			2
working at the @entity1 is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours			1
it is also said to boost mood and productivity there are even two cup holders in case you work up a sweat – but the manufacturer maintains the level of exercise is n’t vigorous enough to cause sweating			0
research published last month found that lounging in a chair for too long can double the risk of diabetes , heart disease and death			0
the findings indicated that sitting is bad in itself , irrespective of other time spent exercising or playing sport			0
professor @entity103 , from the @entity104 , who was one of the researchers , said office staff should take a stand for health by refusing to sit down at meetings and moving their work station to the nearest filing cabinet			0
the study , published in @entity115 , the journal of the @entity117 , analysed research data on people with different levels of sedentary @entity121 with the least sedentary , those who spent the most time sitting down had a 112 per cent greater risk of diabetes			0
similarly , the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes was increased by 147 per cent in the most sedentary , and death linked to heart disease by 90 per cent			0
however one of the problems many of us face is the lack of time to exercise , said @entity135 , ceo of @entity136			0
‘ @entity1 was designed specifically for individuals whose employment or daily schedules confine them to a desk all day			1
study after study has confirmed that staying in motion will increase health and productivity , it is not a surprise that more physical activity would also increase levels of life satisfaction as well			0
