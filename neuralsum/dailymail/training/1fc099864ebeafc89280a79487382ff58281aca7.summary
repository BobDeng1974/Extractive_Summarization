by @entity0 last updated at 3:20 pm on 29th august 2011 rare : the talking @entity3 fortune teller in @entity4 is believed to be the last of its kind magician @entity7 reportedly made a $ 2million bid for a 100 - year - old ' talking @entity11 fortune teller ' that he believes is the only one of its kind in the world - but she could fetch even more than that			1
collectors are battling for ownership over the machine , which sat for decades amid @entity22 kitsch at a restaurant called @entity24 in @entity4 , @entity25 , and now resides in a museum there			1
@entity27 got out about the @entity3 when the @entity28 began restoring her five years ago			2
some mistook her for @entity31 , the fortune - telling machine featured in the @entity34 movie @entity31			1
but instead of dispensing a card like @entity31 , the @entity3 actually speaks your fortune from a hidden record player			2
when you drop a nickel in the slot , her eyes flash , her teeth chatter and her voice comes floating from a tube extending out of the eight - foot - tall box			1
@entity7 told @entity47 that he thinks she is ‘ only one of one ’			1
@entity7 wanted the @entity3 to be the crown jewel in his collection of turn - of the century penny arcade games			1
it would occupy a place of pride among the magician 's mechanised @entity56 , @entity58 and various machines that tested a person 's strength			2
@entity7 acknowledged approaching the curators about buying the @entity3 a few years ago but declined to say what he offered			1
@entity64 , the @entity28 curator who received the call from @entity7 's assistant , said it was in the ballpark of $ 2million ( £ 1.2million ) , along with a proposal to replace it with another fortune - telling machine			1
on top of that , he pledged to promote @entity4 in advertisements			2
the eyes have it : @entity64 , curator of collections for the @entity28 , stands near the antique machine bid : many visitors find the machine creepy , left , but @entity7 , right , made a $ 2million bid for it but heritage commission curators , representing the @entity11 's owner - the state of @entity25 - rejected the idea , saying cashing in on this piece of history would be akin to selling their soul			1
‘ if we start selling our collection for money , what do we have ? ’ said @entity89 , the commission 's former curator of collections			2
the commission 's acting director , @entity95 echoed @entity89 's sentiments : ‘ that is not something we would ever consider , selling off these antiques			0
’ that dismissal has set collectors grumbling			0
@entity104 , a @entity105 collector and renovator of such machines , said he thinks the @entity3 is wasted in @entity4 and should be placed in a private collection for proper care			0
he said he is trying to gather investors to make a $ 3million bid that would top @entity7 's offer			1
‘ they do n't have any idea what they have			0
it 's like they have the world 's best diamond and they just pulled it out of their mineshaft , ’ @entity104 said			0
‘ it 's good that it 's there and it survived , but now it really needs to be part of the world			0
’ @entity104 said he would n't be surprised if the machine ultimately sold for $ 10million ( £ 6.1million ) or more			1
@entity7 also said he is still interested in purchasing it			1
that could put pressure on the state , which , like the rest of the nation , is facing hard fiscal times			0
@entity25 's budget is in the black , but keeping the effects of the recession at arm 's length has meant deep budget cuts			1
snap happy : young visitors try an antique picture machine at the @entity146 in @entity4 those cuts have hit the @entity28 particularly hard			1
just weeks after @entity89 spoke to the @entity47 , her position and three others were eliminated as part of a larger reorganisation to cut $ 400,000 from the commission 's budget , @entity148 said			2
the state agency that oversees the commission , meanwhile , is not so quick to reject the idea of selling the @entity3			0
@entity160 deputy director @entity159 said he has not seen any offers in writing , and if one were made , it would go through a bid process that includes the scrutiny of the commission and input from the public			0
the state inherited the @entity3 in 1998 when it paid $ 6.5million to buy nearly 250 buildings and their contents in @entity4 and nearby @entity173 from the son of @entity175			2
benchmark : a visitor rests his legs outside the @entity146 the @entity25 collector spent years buying up the buildings to preserve the two crumbling ghost towns and he stocked them with his ever - growing collection of antique games , music machines and oddities			1
@entity186 , the heritage commission 's former curator of interpretation , said the collection includes hundreds of thousands of items , so many that curators are still discovering them			0
the @entity3 was made sometime around 1906 by the @entity193 in restoring her , the curators either replaced or repaired frayed , worn or broken parts with exact replicas			0
when they could n't find replicas or period materials , they did n't replace the parts			0
‘ we do n't want to make her anything that she was n't , ’ @entity89 said			0
in 2008 , they installed the @entity3 as the centrepiece of the @entity204 amid the ancient wooden buildings of @entity4 's main street			0
calliope music spills out into the street , beckoning the tens of thousands of visitors to enter and view the stereoscopes , shock tests , tests of strength , fortune telling machines and love letter machines			0
the @entity11 presides over the menagerie in the rear , ropes keeping visitors at a distance			1
all of that care in restoring , preserving and displaying the @entity3 causes state curators to reject @entity104 's argument that the machine should be removed from @entity4 and placed in a private collection			2
‘ a lot of these collectors , they come and say the same thing : “ why is this out in the public ? why do n't you just take the money and have a collector restore it the way it should be restored and have it in his private collection ? ” well , nobody would ever see it , ’ said @entity186 , whose position was also eliminated in the cutbacks .			0
