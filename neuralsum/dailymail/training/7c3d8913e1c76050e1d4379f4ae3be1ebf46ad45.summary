it is pouring with rain in @entity2 as designer - clad stars emerge from limousines and dash into the gleaming glass marquee where the @entity7 show is about to begin			1
inside though , it felt like the brightest of summer days as the @entity11 design house showed its @entity13 collection to a full – and star - studded - house			2
with @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 watching from the front row , @entity15 showed a feminine , genteel collection – he described it as ‘ tender ’ - replete with @entity24 lace in soft macarón hues of mint and rose , mauve and lavender , gentle shapes that borrowed just enough from the archives , the occasional graphic print in black and white or a splash of red , and a ( sometimes liberal ) sprinkling of bling			1
but , this being @entity15 , he also took this most traditional of fabrics and breathed modern life into it , tinting it black and white stripes or turning it into a trench - inspired shirt dress			1
pencil skirts prevailed , coming in that beautiful @entity63 lace , baby soft cashmere that draped at the hips and gathered into a twisted knot at the front ( office wear for those too wealthy to work ) as well as vivid monochrome stripes – which was paired with a spot shirt set surely to take over from the heart print as the piece that makes it to the mainstream ( i spotted at least 20 people wearing that heart shirt at the show today )			1
thanks to @entity15 ’s love of @entity86 cashmere , the @entity7 girl will be kept warm next spring with baby soft , slouchy cardigans in grey , mint and pink			1
outerwear was softer in general			0
light cashmere overcoats in pale grey or white , a single - breasted coat in dusky pink			0
the trench in its most traditional form - beige , gabardine , belted - was entirely absent			1
instead , @entity15 said , he wanted to introduce the elements of the trench but in a gentler way			1
that meant stripping out the lining , using softer fabrics , softer shapes , and more generous cuts that enveloped and cocooned the figure rather than necessarily cinching it			0
sorbet : @entity15 plumped for a hugely pretty palette with sugary shades of pistachio , lemon , candyfloss and delicate almond dominating always soulful , haunting , epic			1
playlist was : @entity119 , by @entity120			0
when we were @entity124 ( @entity125 ) by @entity126			0
@entity15 does the hard work so we can download and discover them			1
' i wanted this idea of everything being much more soft , much more gentle , ' he said after the show			2
' i liked the idea of taking out all the linings , all but the most essential part of the trench			2
i liked the idea of taking the traditional trench coat , the iconic @entity7 trenchcoat but then reimagining it with these soft , fluid fabrics			1
so we used a lot of double - faced cashmeres , we used a lot of silks , so that everything had a very natural flow			0
' fabric is the dna of our brand , ' he added			0
' @entity151 , our founder , invented gabardine , and it 's something care about greatly			2
we have a whole team of people and all they do is work through the innovation , craftsmanship and construction of fabric			0
' everything was soft and feminine and had that sense of kind of wrapping yourself in things			0
' there was kind of tenderness , a vulnerability			0
' the colour palette - those dusky pinks and greens , palest yellow , sugary soft hues , were borne of @entity15 's love of the @entity176 rose - hence the thousands of petals that rained down on the catwalk during the finale			1
' i wanted the colours to be soft and gentle , like sugared flowers , ' @entity15 said			1
' we 've been talking about this @entity176 rose and the breadth and depth of the colours			2
we tried to distill that , so there 's a powderiness to the colours as well as them just being pastel			2
' trench detail was borrowed and used elsewhere			2
a deep sage coat - dress had a scoop neck that echoed the traditional lapel of the trench , a mint - green filigree shirt - dress used trench detailing at the back and trench lapels ; @entity201 walked in a transparent trench cape dotted with dusky pink beading			1
elegant : @entity205 walked the runway in a draped skirt and sheer mint blouse sweet : @entity210 once again proved a popular choice and looks set to be a huge hit next summer embellished : @entity201 modelled a cape in clear plastic embellished with gems down the runway pals : @entity17 , in leopard print @entity7 shirt , watches friend and long - time @entity7 model @entity221 walk the runway in dusky rose lace the mood was certainly gentler than previous seasons ( especially given that last season pvc pencil skirts were the look of the season )			1
it was , said @entity15 , meant to be warm , soft and a little bit romantic			1
‘ i wanted the show to be gentle , to feel enveloping , ’ he said afterwards			2
‘ i wanted it to have a real crafted feeling , something that felt you were really cocooned and protected			0
it was very feminine , gentle and soft			0
but there was a sassiness and a sexiness underneath , and i like that idea of strength and fragility			0
’ @entity221 walked , as did @entity205			1
it is , @entity15 agreed , important to have those big names walking			1
in truth though , @entity201 has been part of the @entity7 gang long before she was the ‘ model of the moment '			1
' we have always loved @entity201 , ’ @entity15 said fondly , as the lady herself leapt around backstage wearing a balaclava and giving out bearhugs			2
‘ she ’s part of the @entity7 family			2
' we have worked with @entity201 for many , many years , ' he added			0
' she 's someone i 'm very close to			0
we have a wonderful relationship			0
i just adore @entity201 , she 's beautiful			0
soft with underlying sassiness : cocooning overcoats , delicate lace , macrame and silk			2
trench coats had lining stripped out , softer material was used graphic : despite a genteel colour palette and the softness of lace elsewhere , @entity15 made sure to maintain his trademark sassiness with cheeky prints @entity273 : @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276 take in the graphic prints that shot through the pastels romantic : a softer aesthetic at @entity7 today - in contrast to the rubber skirts of last season - though there was a sense of sassiness too			1
' both fragility and strength			0
' said @entity15 from left : @entity288 , @entity20 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity19 it 's one of @entity291 's biggest draws and this season 's outing from @entity7 proved to be no exception			1
the cream of @entity297 's style set - as well as heavy hitters from around the world - turned out to see the latest effort from @entity15 at the @entity2 show			1
among the biggest of the big names was @entity304 @entity303 editor @entity302 , who joined @entity306 supremo sir @entity305 and socialite @entity307 on the front row			1
celebrities paying @entity15 the compliment of wearing @entity7 to the show included @entity16 , who wore a black felt dress from the a / @entity314 collection and @entity316 singer @entity17 who plumped for a daring £ 395 leopard print military shirt			1
@entity319 also turned out in @entity7 , choosing a stylish crocodile pencil skirt and a soft nappa leather tank			2
she was joined by actress @entity322 , the half - sister of prince @entity17 's girlfriend @entity323 , and 21 - year - old model , @entity19			1
rounding off the stellar front row was @entity274 , model @entity326 and flame - haired singer @entity20 who was resplendent in - of course - a chic @entity7 skirt			1
fashion on the @entity331 : @entity20 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity19 seemed to be enjoying themselves as they waited for the show to begin stylish : @entity336 socialite @entity307 was elegant in a black jacket and skirt while @entity302 was her usual fashionable self in delicate duck egg blue @entity7 fans : @entity16 ( above ) has appeared in @entity7 fashion campaigns while @entity17 - who recently wore the much - loved heart - print shirt - chose a £ 395 animal print shirt golden girl : it girl and erstwhile tv presenter @entity319 had a ringside seat at @entity7 feeling blue : @entity7 girl and actress @entity322 @entity351 's girl : model @entity19 looked thrilled as she enjoyed @entity7 from the sidelines @entity355 : @entity11 model @entity221 with classic sleek hair an edgier version of the classic @entity176 rose was @entity361 's beauty vision at @entity7 and lead stylist @entity359 was the man asked to provide it			1
' @entity15 ’s inspiration for the collection is @entity355 distressed , ' explained the hair guru			2
' this is why i decided to blow dry the hair in a classic sleek - but not poker straight - as would be expected of an @entity355			0
i then texturised and mattified the hair with @entity371 products to give it an edgy , distressed look			0
' @entity359 began by preparing wet hair with a @entity371 treatment before adding the brand 's @entity376 to make sure hair stayed beautifully smooth			0
' next , i applied @entity379 before blow drying the hair to ensure the movement created by the blow dry held and to give it a more luxury finish , ' explained @entity359			0
luckily for those who want to recreate the look , it 's one that works with any hair type			0
' for thick hair , i blowdried it with a natural centre parting , ' adds @entity359			0
' for long hair , i created some movement by flicking the ends under in a natural way			0
' once the hair was dry , it was divided it into sections and finished with @entity402 and @entity403 to add texture and create a matte finish			0
' @entity359 added : ' before the models went on to the catwalk , the hair was tucked into the coats , and few stray sections were released at the back and side			0
' @entity413 was created by @entity414 using @entity7 and introducing the @entity416 colours and @entity7 nails .			2
