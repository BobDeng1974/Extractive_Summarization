by @entity0 last updated at 10:47 am on 9th february 2012 support : @entity2 and @entity3 with the book gang of one by @entity5 , one of the @entity5 , about his time in a @entity8 jail following his controversial extradition @entity11 ’s mother marched on 10 @entity12 yesterday to condemn the ‘ barbaric ’ treatment of her son			1
@entity2 went to the prime minister ’s official residence to mark a decade of ‘ fear and torment ’ since her son ’s arrest for computer hacking			1
flanked by backers including @entity3 , mp @entity23 and civil liberties campaigner @entity24 , she handed in poetry written by supporters			1
speaking outside no 10 , mrs @entity2 said her son was afflicted by a ‘ terror that consumes his every waking moment ’			1
mr @entity11 , 45 , is wanted by the @entity8 authorities on charges of hacking into @entity33 and @entity34 computers from his home in north @entity36			1
but the @entity38 ’s sufferer says he was looking for evidence of ‘ little green men ’			2
experts say forcing him to go to @entity8 , where he could face a 60 - year jail sentence , could lead to him taking his own life			2
the case has highlighted the ‘ unfairness ’ of the 2003 extradition treaty between @entity53 and the @entity8 - and sparked the @entity49 ’s affront to @entity50			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ ten years have gone by and still @entity5 lives in a nightmare world - unable to control the terror that consumes his every waking moment			1
‘ this endless pressure on an @entity38 man with severe mental health issues is barbaric			2
‘ and for what ? a foolish act that caused embarrassment to the @entity8			2
where has our sense of proportion gone ? ’ she added : ‘ he ca n’t deal with it			2
he sits in the dark - it ’s ruined his life			0
his mental health has deteriorated and it ’s ruined our lives			0
’ she also urged prime minister @entity74 to raise the issue with @entity76 when the two leaders meet at the @entity78 next month			0
also lending support at @entity12 was @entity80 , who faces being sent to the @entity8 on charges his lawyers say are not even a crime in this country			0
the 23 - year - old student is accused of breaking @entity8 copyright laws			0
he set up a website from his halls of residence in @entity91 listing places where films and tv programmes could be illegally downloaded			0
@entity11 , pictured in 2009 with his mother @entity2 , has been battling extradition for a decade but legal experts say this is not an offence because he did not download any of the entertainment himself			1
his mother @entity100 , a pediatric nurse , said : ‘ to be fighting this situation for ten years and for @entity5 and the family having this hanging over their lives for all this time is disgusting			0
‘ he has more than paid his penalty - and the @entity8 is picking on him because he embarrassed them			0
’ miss @entity24 , director of the civil rights group @entity108 , said : ‘ i can not believe it has been ten years			0
after all the promises that have been made by many politicians we are still here			0
‘ @entity2 is doing this for her son but she is also doing it for everyone else ’s sons and daughters			1
’ ‘ as @entity5 ’s ordeal continues so does the current rotten extradition regime			1
no - one is immune from unfair treatment and the lack of compassion in the system is already devastating too many lives			0
’ home secretary @entity126 agreed to delay his extradition in 2010 and is examining psychiatric evidence before she makes a final decision			1
last month two judges sitting in the @entity131 ruled @entity5 ’s ordeal must be decided by the summer .			0
