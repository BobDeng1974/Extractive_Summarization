@entity7 , 66 , who lives with her seriously ill husband @entity8 , 72 , was forced to act when the gang entered her home in @entity10 , @entity11 , on tuesday			1
the raiders told the pensioner they had seen a man run into the couple 's semi-detached property and they were trying to catch him			2
but mrs holding did n't believe their story and threatened the gang with her stick until they left			1
@entity7 , 66 , threatened a gang of three that stormed her home with her stick until they ran away mr @entity22 , a retired plumber , who suffers from heart , kidney and lung problems as well as diabetes , was upstairs at the time and phoned the police from the bedroom			1
after mrs holding forced two of the men out of the back door , she then pursued a third raider who ran upstairs and started rifling through the couple 's bedroom			1
the retired hotel manager again used her stick to force the man out of her house			2
all three of the gang fled the house empty - handed			0
another man who was acting as a look - out in the garden also ran away			2
the gang entered the woman 's home through a back door and said they 'd seen a man running into the house mrs @entity7 said : ' we had left the back door open as our nephew might have popped in but when we heard a noise and called out there was no answer			1
' when we went out to the hall we saw the men , it was really scary			2
i saw one of the men go upstairs so up i went with the walking stick			1
' they were trying to claim someone was hiding under the bed or behind the wardrobe but i said " that ’s impossible "			0
i said : " get out now , get out now before i hit you "			2
' he was saying : " do n’t hit me , do n’t hit me , do n’t hit me " , and i was saying : " i ’m going to hit you , i ’m going to hit you , i ’m going to hit you "			2
@entity7 , pictured with her ill husband @entity8 , 72 , said she is convinced the gang would have hurt the couple if she did n't act ' i did n’t want to hit him because i was worried what the other would do to my husband , otherwise i would definitely have hit him			1
' the men were very threatening and i am convinced if i had n’t done anything they would have hurt myself and my husband			1
' he then went downstairs and i went into another room , where another one was , and i told him to get him out			0
i threatened to hit him too			1
i should have hit him			2
' luckily they left through the back door , they seemed quite frightened			0
' i attacked the men to protect my poorly husband , who needs oxygen 15 hours a day			1
i was more concerned about him because he ’s not in good health			0
' i ’d do it again if they came back			0
we were both really shook up afterwards			0
police are now hunting the men - described as white and in their early 20s ' it was frightening at the time because everything is happening so quickly			1
i just wanted them out and i got them out			0
' they could have turned nasty			0
but right now i just feel angry , angry that they have been in my house			0
' @entity104 are hunting three men who are described as white and in their early 20s			0

' the three men ran back out of the rear door where it seems a fourth man had been waiting for them			1
the men all then made off on foot and were not seen again			0
