with luxury plane suites pushing the boundaries of lavish travel , the upstairs - downstairs - style divide between economy and suites is continually growing			0
and now @entity6 is set to introduce an extra seat to each row of its @entity6 model , squeezing yet more passengers onto each plane			1
from 2017 there will be 11 seats incorporated into the same space as the current 10 are placed , and a fourth class introduced in response to the new dreaded middle seat			1
the change is due to come into place in 2017 the configuration was rejected by @entity25 but two manufacturers , @entity26 and @entity27 , have agreed to deliver the seats the addition of the centre seat will change the current configuration from 3 - 4 - 3 to become a 3 - 5 - 3 set up			1
at the moment the company uses @entity34 , but there will soon be the addition of ' budget economy ' , cleverly branded as @entity38			2
some critics have gone as far as calling the new set - up ' economy minus '			0
senior vice president of marketing for @entity43 , told trade publication @entity44 and @entity46 : ' ninety per cent of world travellers are economy but not all are homogeneous			2
' we want to give a choice to the 90 per cent of the economy passengers			1
they are going to be the driver of the growth , the doubling of growth in the next 15 years			0
' miraculously the inclusion of an additional seat will not alter the seat width for economy ticket holders			2
currently the width is 18in , which falls in line with the aircraft manufacturer 's manifesto 18 months ago to adopt that size as an industry standard			0
@entity6 claims a rearrange of the cabin has enabled it to maintain this width and squeeze in the extra seat			1
the width of the arm rest , however , will change , with the aircraft adopting a slimmer version			0
the launch was announced in @entity77 this week , despite customer @entity25 confirming it would not pursue the new arrangement for its aircraft - reportedly over fears the new design could affect its reputation for quality economy seating , according to trade publication @entity85			0
@entity6 vice president - @entity86 and @entity88 said at the @entity89 that more innovation should be going into economy cabins			1
' in the past most innovation went into premium products , but that is only for six per cent of the travellers , ' he said			0
the @entity6 will be advertised as having 544 seats instead of 525 , and @entity98 said the additional revenue per aircraft would be $ 20m per year			2
' that 's the equivalent of 40 per cent fuel burn reduction , ' he explained			0
how the other half live ! @entity104 fliers can enjoy private three - room suite for a luxurious first - class experience luxury surroundings : the @entity6 cabin is one of the quietest and most spacious in the sky			1

@entity6 are *increasing* their seats from 10 to 11 seats in every row
the addition will see @entity6 *creating* a fourth *cheaper* class called choice
the change is to be launched in 2017 on the @entity6 model
@entity6 state the move is to *reflect* 90 per cent of fliers using economy
*thankfully* seat widths will remain at the standard 18 inches
