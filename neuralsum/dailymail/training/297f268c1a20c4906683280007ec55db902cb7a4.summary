your washing might smell fresh but do n't be lulled into a false sense of cleanliness			0
the move away from the high - temperature washes and harsh detergents of our grandmothers ’ era may be kinder to fabrics , the environment and sensitive skin but it could costing us our health			1
research has shown that potentially harmful bacteria in our laundry is not being killed off in low - temperature washes , turning the average spin cycle into a breeding ground for germs			1
how clean is your laundry ? scientists say today 's gentle washing methods create a ' bacteria soup ' for clothes to swish around in and spread contagious bugs such as @entity28 and @entity29 the levels of bacteria found by microbiologists in our washing machines and on supposedly ‘ clean ’ laundered clothes has led leading hygiene expert , dr @entity37 , to call for an increased awareness of what is being termed the ‘ @entity40 ’			1
dr @entity37 said : ' consumers believe that normal laundering produces ‘ clean ’ clothes but this does not necessarily translate to ‘ hygienically ’ clean			2
' the trend towards reducing washing temperatures and water volumes alongside using gentler detergents has affected the efficacy of the laundering process for reducing bacteria on contaminated clothing			2
it ’s time to re-evaluate the hygiene of our laundry			0
' do at least one cycle without any clothes in the machine at 90 ° c once a month to spring clean the interior of the appliance			0
wash bed sheets or underpants and socks in a separate wash from face flannels and tea towels - especially during a low - temperature wash			1
do n’t shut your machine door immediately after a wash			0
let it air to reduce the growth of bacteria inside			0
regularly clean your washing machine ’s door seals and detergent drawer and wash your hands thoroughly after handling heavily soiled laundry			2
if washing at low temperatures without a laundry disinfectant then always wash your hands after you take wet items out of the machine			2
in fact a microbial assessment to evaluate the infection risks associated with laundry found an estimated average of 0.1g grams ( 10,000 organisms ) of faecal matter on every pair of ‘ clean ’ knickers			1
the @entity40 is n’t just about the inadequate removal of bacteria from contaminated clothes			0
cross-contamination also plays a part			0
' if you put something ridden with bacteria in the washing machine you will simply be swishing the germs around - creating a ‘ bacterial soup ’ - unless you do something to kill them			1
' i am very concerned about bacteria from soiled underwear transferring onto items such as tea towels which are then used to wipe dishes , ” says dr @entity37			1
items that are most likely to be contaminated with pathogens are those which come into direct contact with the body - underwear , towels , facecloths , bedlinen and nappies			1
bacteria lurking inside washing machines can also be responsible for cross-contamination : ' studies have shown that a build - up of bacteria in the interior of the washing machine transfers to the wash water of subsequent cycles – with as many as one million bacteria found in just two tablespoons of wash water			1
bacteria from soiled underwear and dirty dishrags have been shown to get distributed to other pieces of clothing in the laundry load ' low - temperature washing provides optimal conditions for germs to breed and multiply in favourite hideaways such as the detergent drawer and door seals , ' explained dr @entity37			1
in particular , the @entity40 is a problem if someone in the house is ill. segregating clothes , bedding and towels infected by a bout of sickness from the rest of the household laundry is n’t enough to stop the risk of spreading infection if you are handling items washed at low temperatures			2
dr @entity37 warned : ' bacteria on wet clothes are more likely to contaminate hands			0
@entity164 of germs from hands to objects in the home and ultimately our mouths is thereforea risk			0
' by increasing our understanding of why bacteria are not always removed in the washingmachine , how they can cross-contaminate and the simple everyday steps needed toprevent potential sources of infection , the @entity40 can be broken			0

low temperature cycles not strong enough to kill *disease* - causing bugs
@entity183 found 0.1g of faecal matter remains on ' clean ' knickers
*mixing* underwear with tea towels in load creates a ' bacterial soup '
scientists found one million bacteria in two tablespoons of wash water
potentially contagious germs *include* @entity29 , @entity28 and *norovirus*
