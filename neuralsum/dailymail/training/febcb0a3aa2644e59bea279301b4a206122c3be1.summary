barring a late injury scare , @entity0 is all set to join an elite list of @entity3 plying their trade abroad to line up in a @entity6 final			1
it 's a monumental moment for the @entity9 winger , who has enjoyed a season to surpass the expectations of most after his Â£ 86million world - record transfer from @entity14			1
twenty - one goals later and @entity0 is really showing why the club splurged so much money on him in september			1
the 24 - year - old is ready to start for @entity21 's side against city rivals @entity22 in @entity23 on saturday night and here , @entity18 looks at the seven other @entity24 abroad who 've had the pleasure of playing in @entity27 's showpiece fixture			1
inspiration : @entity29 ( challenging @entity30 ) was superb for @entity31 in the 1997 final against @entity34 giants @entity33 @entity29 - @entity31 3 - 1 @entity33 ( 1997 ) the @entity36 man bossed midfield for @entity31 during his solitary season in @entity39 and immediately became a cult hero with supporters			1
not hard to see why really			2
the @entity43 boss assisted one of the goals and nullified the threat of a certain @entity47 , who was just starting to become a real influence on the world stage			2
@entity29 is still talked about over there			1
in typical straight - talking style , he said : ' i gave the shirts i swapped with the @entity33 players after the game to my dad , ' he reflected			2
' but he 's a roof - tiler , wore them to work and they 're ripped to pieces			2
as for the medals , they 're round the house somewhere , i do n't know where			0
' but all the experience that came with winning them is up here [ in the mind ]			0
' @entity68 - @entity9 3 - 0 @entity69 ( 2000 ) definitely a midfielder whose talents have now been largely forgotten , but @entity68 in his pomp - the run up to his move to @entity9 and immediately after - was one of the country 's more frightening wingers			1
and he can lay claim to having scored in a @entity6 final			0
operating centrally , @entity68 was at his sublime best			0
the goal was a stunning volley @entity9 swept @entity69 aside at the @entity83 , and it was in part down to the brilliance of the @entity87 lad they signed from @entity88 a year beforehand			1
that 's about as good as it got for him			2
absurd really that @entity68 never truly kicked on after that night in @entity92			0
what a hit ! @entity68 scored a super volley and was named man of the match against @entity69 that was the one : the @entity98 enjoyed his finest night in football at the @entity83 in may 2000 @entity101 - @entity100 1 - 1 @entity69 ( 5 - 4 pens ) ( 2001 ) one of those nights where the @entity105 press stood up and wondered who this scrawny midfielder - eligible for the national team - was , completely bossing a @entity100 midfield			0
next to the legendary @entity110 , keen to banish the nightmare final moments of the 1999 final against @entity113 , @entity101 shone			0
he had been key in the semi-final win against @entity9 weeks previously , while the @entity115 went on to star at the @entity116 in 2002 for @entity117			1
coming of age : @entity101 was exceptional for @entity100 in their run to the 2001 final @entity122 - @entity121 0 - 0 @entity123 ( 0 - 2 pens ) ( 1986 ) joined @entity121 in 1984 from @entity14 and @entity122 started brightly at the @entity125			0
by the time 1986 came around , he was n't a regular but did play in the final under @entity128			0
@entity122 played a key role in defending from the front in the goalless draw but had been substituted before the penalty shootout			0
@entity133 - @entity9 0 - 1 @entity88 ( 1981 ) @entity133 is one of the most exciting players to have ever graced the @entity105 game , tragically dying in a car accident while at @entity137 in 1989			1
the winger started his career at @entity140 but truly made his name at @entity142 before a move to @entity9			1
he was electric for the @entity145 giants , but - on the biggest club stage of them all - @entity133 was n't able to impact on the final			0
a shame : @entity122 was n't able to add a @entity6 winners ' medal during his @entity121 career struggle : @entity133 ( tackled by @entity88 's @entity154 ) was n't able to impact upon the final @entity157 - @entity156 0 - 0 @entity158 ( 3 - 5 pens ) ( 1991 ) you could hardly blame him , but when offered the opportunity to step up for @entity156 in the final 's penalty shootout , @entity157 turned it down			1
after all , it was under a year since that night in @entity166 when the former @entity168 midfielder blindingly smashed over the crossbar at the @entity170			0
@entity172 - @entity171 0 - 1 @entity173 ( 1980 ) his final season over in @entity39 almost looked like ending perfectly , but @entity171 inexplicably came unstuck against @entity175 's @entity173			2
@entity176 - much like the favourites - never got going at the @entity178 and left the club for @entity180 that summer			0
he knew the final was to be his last game , but still it ended in a damp squib			0
@entity185 in hands moment : @entity157 watched his @entity156 side lose on penalties at the end of the 1991 final			1

@entity0 set to start for @entity21 's side *alongside* @entity193
@entity9 face @entity22 at the @entity195 on saturday
