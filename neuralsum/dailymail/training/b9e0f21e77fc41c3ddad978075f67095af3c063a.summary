it 's not just the four inches he gives away in height that has @entity3 continually looking up to @entity4			1
for any aspiring @entity8 centre - half , the @entity6 skipper has long been the industry standard			1
and , as a team - mate of the player at the @entity12 , @entity3 knows better than most how high the bar has been set			1
yet , while imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , @entity3 intends to map out his own career mindful of @entity4 ’s achievements but not transfixed by them			1
@entity3 joins in a training exercise with @entity22 team - mates @entity4 and @entity23 @entity3 tracks @entity24 forward @entity25 after he was called up to the @entity22 squad for the first time ‘ @entity4 is an inspiration to me but i do n’t want to be the same as him , ’ said the 19 - year - old , who stands at 6ft			1
‘ he is someone i look to but it ’s not that i want to be like him			2
i want to be myself			2
‘ i admire the way he plays but i do n’t want to be a copy of @entity35			0
i want to be @entity3 - not @entity4			1
’ @entity3 had plenty of scope to reacquaint himself with the @entity6 captain during the international break			1
called into @entity42 ’ party for the first time for the game with @entity45 , the on - loan @entity40 spent most of the week with his mouth closed and his ears open			2
‘ going away with the @entity8 national squad was a great experience for me , ’ he added			0
‘ there are so many players from big clubs and it was great to train with them and learn from them			0
it was good for me			0
the 19 - year - old speaks to the assembled media ahead of thursday night 's @entity59 clash @entity3 was all smiles in training as @entity62 prepare to face @entity63 in the @entity59 ‘ i was surprised to get the call - up because it was a really big game			1
‘ a lot of players helped me when i met up with the squad - @entity68 , @entity70 and @entity4 were three of them			1
‘ @entity4 spoke to me , made a few jokes with me and the team			1
it helps that i know the captain of the @entity8 team so well			0
‘ everybody listens to @entity4			2
he has the respect of everyone in the country			0
‘ he gives me a lot of advice but mainly , just to be myself and everything will be okay			0
’ if @entity4 ’s advice had included that @entity3 targets a push for a first - team slot at @entity6 next season , then he was wasting his breath			1
for all the year ’s loan to @entity62 is proving invaluable in terms of exposure to first - team football , his heart remains with the @entity95 champions			1
‘ i watched @entity6 play in the @entity96 on tuesday night and i want to be back there next season , ’ he stated			1
‘ but i do n’t think about this too much			0
i prefer to think about the present at @entity62			2
i want to do well enough here to maybe play there			0
‘ the loan move has already helped me a lot			2
i have played first - team football and been called up to the national team			2
‘ being at @entity62 has given me what i did n’t have at @entity6			1
reserve - team football at @entity6 is good but it ’s not the same as playing for a first - team			1
‘ in under 21 football , you play against young opponents			2
at @entity62 , i am playing against men			1
but i still want to go back to @entity95 after my loan and try to be a success			1
’ before those @entity96 ambitions can be realised with his parent club , the rather more mundane matter of the @entity59 with @entity62 comes into view tonight			1
@entity3 is not alone when he states honestly that he could ink his knowledge of the @entity122 on the back of a postage stamp			1
yet he ’s acutely aware of the significance of taking six points from them over the coming two matches			0
‘ i do n’t know a lot about @entity63			0
just that they come from @entity122 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s very important to win this game			0
@entity133 are playing against @entity134 and we hope that will be a draw			2
‘ that would give us a better chance to finish first if we beat @entity63			0
‘ i think we can beat them and give ourselves a chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity59			0
’ a victory tonight would n’t just put @entity62 in the box seat for qualification			2
it would be a much - needed endorsement of @entity149 ’s regime			0
@entity3 ’s partnership with @entity151 has been one of the few certainties upon which the @entity154 has been able to hang his hit thus far and the @entity8 foresees that developing further throughout his season in @entity157			1
‘ @entity151 is great to play beside , ’ he added			0
‘ he is a very good player and he is relaxed when he speaks to you			0
‘ how good is he ? he can be a very good player			0
i expect him to play at a high level in @entity95 one day			2
‘ how high ? the highest			0
playing beside @entity151 and @entity4 helps my game			1
they are very good players and speak to me			0
‘ if i make a mistake , @entity151 is there for me			0

@entity3 , 19 , is at @entity62 on loan from @entity95 champions @entity6
he cites @entity6 and @entity22 *defender* @entity4 as an inspiration
but @entity3 is keen to map out his own career , and wants to be back at the @entity12 next season playing @entity96 football
