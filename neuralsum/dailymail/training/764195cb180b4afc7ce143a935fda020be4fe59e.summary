by mail online reporter published : 03:21 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 05:51 est , 8 january 2014 a powerful and graphic road safety commercial has been released in a bid to persuade drivers to slow down or face grave consequences			1
the commercial , entitled ‘ mistakes ’ , was released by the @entity8 and features a driver pulling out in front of a speeding vehicle			1
time slows right down as the cars are about to collide , allowing both drivers get out of their vehicles in a bid to avoid the devastation			2
‘ please , i ’ve got my boy in the back ’ , he stutters as tears fill his eyes and the camera pans to a young child in the backseat of his car			1
realising his grave misjudgement , the speeding driver replies : ‘ maybe … if i was going a bit slower			0
i ’m going too fast , i ’m sorry ’			0
the first man , realising his and his son ’s fate , puts his hands to his head in devastation and gets back in his car			0
a split second later , time resumes and the speeding car violently ploughs into the man and his son ’s vehicle			0
the commercial starts with the two men getting out of their cars , the father on the right , and the speeding driver on the left ' i 've got my boy in the back ' : the father pleads with the speeding driver to slow down although the speeding man is apologetic , he knows he is driving too fast to be able to avoid crashing into the other man and his son the commercial ’s final shot implores drivers : ‘ other people make mistakes			1
’ the advertisement – which is expected to run for two years – has gone viral , but @entity81 are n’t the first to use shock tactics to get their message across to road users			1
a particularly graphic four - minute public service video – in which three girls are involved in a horrific crash after the driver gets distracted while texting - caused a stir in the @entity90 in 2009			2
last year , as part of the @entity90 @entity94 ’s think ! campaign , an ad ran to show the dangers of drink driving			0
in it , unsuspecting men washing their hands in a bathroom were shocked and terrified as a mannequin cracked through the other side of the mirror , causing ‘ blood ’ to drip down			2
the commercial was done to simulate a pedestrian crashing into a car ’s windscreen			0
powerful message : frustrated , the man covers his head in his hands , knowing that the crash is unavoidable @entity114 shot : the poignant message of the commercial reads ; ' other people make mistakes			1
