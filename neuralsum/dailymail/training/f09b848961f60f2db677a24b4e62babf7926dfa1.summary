the children of a wealthy widow are in a legal battle with her former physiotherapist over the woman ’s £ 30 million fortune			1
the two adult children told a court how the female physiotherapist has possession of their frail mother ’s jewellery including a ‘ very valuable ’ diamond ring and £ 5 million of her money			1
they also feared she was planning to take their 81 - year - old mother , who suffers from parkinson ’s disease and dementia , to @entity17 without their consent			1
the children told the @entity20 hearing that the physiotherapist helped herself to money and valuables at a preliminary @entity20 hearing , the children argued that the physiotherapist had helped herself to money and valuables from their mother and late father , who died in june this year , and ‘ emotionally and physically abused ’ the elderly couple			1
district judge @entity31 - who ruled no parties in the case could be identified - heard the physiotherapist was employed by the couple in 2000 , and grew personally close to the husband , which led to a serious deterioration in his relationship with his children			2
the children claimed that between 2009 and 2011 , their father and the physiotherapist restricted contact with their mother			2
when their father died in june 2014 , they feared that the physiotherapist had ‘ unfettered control of the household and could physically abuse their mother ’			2
the children ’s barrister , @entity50 , said : ‘ there is a strong case of physical , emotional and financial abuse against their elderly and vulnerable parents			0
’ they also expressed concerns she was planning to take their mother to @entity17 ( pictured ) , without their consent at an earlier hearing in july , the children were granted a court injunction , forcing the physiotherapist to hand over their mother ’s passport and not take her out of @entity66			1
the physiotherapist was also required to leave the widow ’s home , and she later gave her up appointment as executor of the widow ’s will , and flew to @entity17			1
at the second hearing , held to consider costs in the case , mr @entity50 argued ‘ it is not without significance that a substantial proportion ’ of her 60th wedding anniversary jewellery purchased by her late husband in february 2014 was in the physiotherapist ’s possession ... plus a very valuable diamond ring ’ belonging to their mother			2
and they claimed she had received about £ 5 million of the family ’s money since 2008			0
@entity91 @entity90 , representing the physiotherapist , said his client ‘ does not accept ’ the truth of the evidence against her , but if she gave detailed replies it would drive up the legal costs			0
mr @entity90 called for her £ 11,000 costs should be paid from the widow ’s estate , which was worth £ 30 million			0
she had complied with a wide ranging injunction backed by the threat of prison , he added , but that there was no real need for the order , as she had simply suggested to the children that their mother might like to go to @entity17			1
district judge @entity31 ruled that the allegations against the physiotherapist were a matter for another court ‘ in the context of any claim brought against her for the recovery for funds			0
’ he also lifted the earlier injunction			0
her conduct in the case , he said , had been satisfactory and he ordered all costs to be paid from the widow ’s estate			0
the judge also declaration that the widow ’s decisions in her ‘ living will ’ were valid and applied to her treatment .			0
