after scoffing a huge roast dinner , tucking into a box of chocolates and finishing off a bottle of festive tipple , many of us are prone to falling asleep in front of the tv			2
but that does mean we miss out on all the @entity11 specials , films and end of the year quizzes			0
with this in mind , a pair of teenagers has created a wearable band that knows when its wearer has dozed off			1
it then pauses and records whatever was being watched so it can be viewed later on			2
the band then mimics a @entity31 remote by pausing , recording or resuming the show that is currently being watched			1
other people in the family can then change the channel without interfering with the recording called @entity26 , the 3d - printed band was created by @entity40 students @entity38 , 15 , and @entity41 , 14 , in partnership with @entity43 as part of its @entity46 initiative			1
the wearable tech features a pulse oximeter , and a wireless sensor which means it can ‘ talk ’ to a @entity31 box			1
pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels , or saturation in the blood			2
it is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed			0
when people fall asleep , this flow of blood changes and a pulse oximeter can use these changes to recognise when someone has dozed off - and equally , when they are awake again			1
the current @entity26 prototype ( pictured ) features a spark core chip , pulse - oximeter , push button , sleep mode indicator and a small @entity73 battery @entity26 measures a user ’s heart rate to detect sleep			1
it then communicates with a @entity31 box to pause and record the current programme being viewed			2
when the user ’s heart rate rises to ‘ awake ’ levels it triggers @entity43 ’s @entity31 boxes to resume the programme			2
the current @entity26 prototype features a spark core chip , pulse - oximeter , push button , sleep mode indicator and a small @entity73 battery			1
the spark core chip at the heart of @entity26 processes all the data from the pulse - oximeter , dictating when the band triggers @entity31 to record , pause or re-play			1
the outer casing of @entity94 is @entity95 printed using an @entity97 3d printer using a resin called @entity99			2
this resin is more robust than the rigid plastics used by most 3d printers			0
wearable technologies such as @entity26 could also be used to monitor wearer ’s emotional reactions to their tv viewing , helping @entity31 learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer			1
@entity43 will be trialling kipstr this @entity11 with customers able to register interest in @entity26 from this month			0
it is also exploring how @entity26 could sleep - control other connected devices in the home including powering up and down devices and controlling customers central heating , helping save time and money			0
once @entity26 establishes the wearer has fallen asleep , the band mimics a @entity31 remote to pause and record the show that is currently being watched			1
and if the person wakes up , the show will resume			0
additionally , once a show is being recorded , other people in the family can change the channel without interfering with this recording			1
mr @entity38 , studying at @entity129 said : ‘ we jumped at the chance to work with the @entity43 team on this project , it was a brilliant challenge for us but we ’ve learnt so much and are really pleased with the end result			0

it is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed			0
oxygen in the air is breathed into the lungs before passing into the blood , where it attaches to haemoglobin , and circulates to the tissues			0

mr @entity41 added : ‘ it ’s given us a taster for what we would like to do when we leave school			0
we ’re excited to see what the next project will bring			0
’ wearable technologies such as @entity26 could also be used to monitor wearer ’s emotional reactions to their tv viewing , helping @entity31 learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer			2

two teenagers created a wearable band to be worn while watching tv
it uses a pulse - oximeter to track changes in blood flow that occur when people fall asleep
the 3d - printed band was created in partnership with @entity43
once it establishes the wearer is asleep , the band mimics a @entity31 remote
it then pauses , records or resumes the show currently being watched
other people can change the channel without interfering with the recording
