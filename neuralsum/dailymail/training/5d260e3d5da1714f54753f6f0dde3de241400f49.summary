by @entity0 low - income earners could get 90 per cent of their childcare payments subsidised - including the use of nannies - under a recommended overhaul of @entity7 's childcare system			1
it 's a reform mother of three , @entity9 , from @entity10 , on the @entity12 central coast , says is crucial if the government wants more mothers to join the workforce			1
ms @entity9 can only afford a nanny once a week but she says a nanny 's help is still invaluable in allowing her to juggle her career and raise her three children , sons @entity23 , two , and @entity24 , six , and daughter @entity21 , five - particularly when one child is sick			1
on the two days she does n't have a nanny , her youngest , @entity23 , is in childcare			2
the draft @entity37 report into child care on tuesday recommended the government spend an extra $ 2 billion a year on supporting working parents			1
it 's anticipated these changes would enable around 47,000 mothers to return to work			0
' mothers should be encouraged to return to work but no one makes it easy for us , ' ms @entity9 said			2
' my family would struggle if i was n't working , but it 's also important for me to keep my foot in the door			1
i need to do it to keep my skills up in the industry , as well as for my mental sanity			0
the inquiry recommends government subsidies for families employing nannies for the first time - as long as they meet quality standards			1
the per - child payment would be means tested and paid directly to child care providers and cover up to 100 hours per fortnight there would be a top - up payment for children with extra needs			2
mrs @entity9 says a nanny ' is costly but so important ' both for herself as a working woman and for her son 's needs			1
' my son is cared for by people whose sole responsibility is to give him quality care			0
they do different stimulating activities through the day that i could n't do with my son			0
my nanny is only there to have fun and to help him to learn , but when i 'm there i need to try keep on top of the washing , cleaning and other household chores			0
' the @entity104 children 's mother , @entity102 , says women need more support to return to work as mothers mrs @entity9 says the nanny is crucial to helping juggle all three children , especially when they 're sick			1
' a nanny really helps when one of your children is sick and you need to keep them home , or with school holidays			0
there 's not enough sick leave to support mothers in these situations and missing out on pay for school holidays four times a year is n't an option			2
' a study last week found that the current subsidies make it essentially worthless for mothers to return to work , revealing that some mothers only have 1 per cent of their pay left after paying for childcare			2
a full - time working mother on $ 43,000 with two - children will use 99 per cent of her wage to pay for care , the research from the @entity133 of @entity134 and @entity135 reveals			2
the @entity37 suggests the government pay 90 per cent of costs for families on less than $ 60,000 a year and tapering down to 30 per cent for families bringing in more than $ 300,000			1
families where neither parent works or studies for at least 24 hours a fortnight would n't get any payment			0
the @entity37 also recommends the government let au pairs on working holiday visas work for 12 months instead of six			2
au pairs still would n't attract any government subsidies			0
there was broad support for the national quality framework @entity157 established but it could be tweaked to reduce costs without compromising quality			0
the inquiry hopes reforms will encourage 47,000 mothers to return to work if the federal government takes up the commission 's recommendations , the significant changes would affect every childcare user and provider			1
but the commission says it 's worth it			0
the new system would cost the government about $ 8 billion a year - roughly $ 1 billion more than childcare assistance costs now			1
many of the 1000 - plus submissions to the inquiry suggested redirecting some money from prime minister @entity180 's planned changes to the paid parental leave scheme			0
the commission agrees there may be a case for this , saying it 's unclear whether increasing paid parental leave would bring significant additional benefits			0
opposition early childhood spokeswoman @entity189 cautioned that if no extra money was put into the system then any expansion to cover nannies would mean cuts to existing services			1
assistant minister for education @entity196 said she did n't want to pre-empt the commission 's final report , due in october .			0

a report released on tuesday recommends the @entity203 's childcare *rebate* cover the use of nannies
government advised to pay up to 90 **%** of a family *â€™s* childcare costs if they earn less than $ 60,000
some @entity7 mums only take home 1 **%** of their pay after childcare costs
working mum @entity9 supports the recommendations , saying her nanny is costly but crucial to juggling three kids
the recommendations would cost government an extra $ 1 to 2 billion each year
