@entity0 and progressive icon @entity1 took a subtle jab at possible opponent @entity3 and @entity5 's husband today while speaking at a labor conference			1
she mentioned neither the former first lady nor president @entity5 by name but took shots at his oversight of the financial sector and ridiculed @entity12 as well as @entity13 for weakening regulations on the banking industry			1
@entity16 says she 's not competing for the @entity12 nomination for president in 2016 , but that has n't deterred her fans , who are holding her up as a left - wing alternative to @entity3			1
@entity5 has n't officially announced her candidacy but is believed to be assembling her campaign team in preparation for a possible spring launch			1
@entity26 sen. @entity1 took a subtle jab at the @entity28 today during the @entity29 at @entity30 in @entity31 she mentioned neither the former first lady nor president @entity5 by name but took shots at his oversight of the financial sector and ridiculed @entity12 as well as @entity13 for weakening regulations on the banking industry according to @entity38 , @entity5 has already approached former aide @entity39 , her likely campaign manager , and @entity41 , president @entity42 's pollster , to join her team			1
' she has said that she is seriously considering running for president			2
she ’s casting a wide net , meeting with a variety of experts to discuss the economy and a range of challenges facing @entity52 families			0
and she ’s using this time to look at what components are necessary to build an inclusive , thoughtful and technically advanced campaign , so that if she decides to run , she ’ll be ready , ' a source familiar with her plans told the news publication			0
@entity5 is known to have been meeting with potential campaign managers throughout the last two months			1
@entity60 , a veteran of @entity5 's 2008 campaign for president presumed to be on the short list for the job , revealed in late december that he 'd met with @entity5 but would n't be running point if she gets into the race , as widely expected			1
' i have spent time with secretary @entity5 encouraging her to run because i believe our country needs her vision and leadership , ' the former @entity69 executive director told @entity38			1
' i have offered her my full support and will be her most vocal volunteer , but after 10 years of some of the toughest campaigns around , i am eager to try my hand at something new and to serve my country in a different way			0
' @entity39 has also been named as a top contender to serve as @entity5 's chief strategist and his close friend and fellow @entity5 ' 08 alum @entity87 is anticipated to serve as his right hand man if he 's tapped for the job			1
@entity87 served as a special assistant to the president until last friday when he left the administration to return to the grassroots consulting firm he helped found after the 2012 presidential election , 270 strategies			2
@entity5 has stayed mum over the last few weeks about which way she is leaning , but her talks with top @entity12 strategists suggest she 's in the process of building a campaign apparatus and could formally enter the race in late march after she 's made her last paid appearance			1
the former secretary of state has confirmed engagements through march 19 and is unlikely to launch her campaign until she 's off the speaking circuit , which helped her add more than $ 5 million in the last two years to her personal wealth			1
the nest egg could come in handy if @entity5 needs to dip into her personal funds again to help buoy her presidential campaign			2
the money she earned for the paid speeches could prove as much trouble as it 's worth , though , as she could find herself spending million in the primary fending off attacks from her own party over payments she has receive from financial services executives to address various industry gatherings			1
progressives worry she would n't take a heavy enough hand to @entity125 , which also served as a source of funding for her 2006 @entity129 campaign			2
former @entity52 president @entity5 and former @entity52 secretary of state @entity3 depart the former governor of @entity135 @entity134 's funeral in @entity136 , @entity135 on tuesday			1
@entity3 is expected to announce her candidacy for president sometime this spring @entity5 has publicly wailed against the ' shadow banking system that operated without accountability ' in a speech before the @entity142 in march , yet she is also said to have privately assured banking executives , whom she charges roughly $ 200,000 a pop to have her come speak , that she finds attacks on the industry discomforting			1
an account of a speech she made to @entity149 published in @entity38 in december of 2013 described her as more or less telling investors : ' we all got into this mess together , and we ’re all going to have to work together to get out of it ' and that ' beating up the finance industry is n’t going to improve the economy — it needs to stop			2
' @entity16 indirectly tapped into progressives ' concerns that @entity5 is talking out of both sides of her mouth today at an @entity161			2
' pretty much the whole @entity13 , and , if we ’re going to be honest , too many dems , have talked about the evils of @entity165 and called for deregulation , ' @entity16 said in remarks taped by @entity13 opposition research firm @entity168			0
' it all sounded good but what it was really about was tying the hands of regulators and turning loose big banks and giant international corporations to do whatever they wanted to do ; turning them loose to rig the market and reduce competition ; turning them loose to outsource more jobs ; turning them loose to load up on more risks and then hide behind taxpayer guarantees ; turning them loose to sell more mortgages and credit cards that cheated @entity52 families , ' she continued			0
@entity16 later said , ' for more than 30 years @entity31 has far too often advanced policies that hammer @entity52 ’s middle class even harder			0
' look at the choices that @entity31 has made , the choices that have left @entity52 ’s working families in a deep hole , the choice to leash up the financial cops , the choice in a recession to bail out the biggest banks with no strings attached while families suffered , ' she added			2
included in the last 30 years of presidents is , of course , @entity5 , who served two terms from 1993 to 2000			2
under @entity5 's watch the banking industry saw a serious cut back in regulations after @entity208 repealed the 1933 @entity209			1
in a 2008 interview with @entity211 contended that the changes he signed into law almost a decade before were n't as steep as his detractors made them out to be			0
' it was n't a complete deregulation at all			0
we still have heavy regulations and insurance on bank deposits , requirements on banks for capital and for disclosure , ' he said at the time			0
' but i have really thought about this a lot			0
i do n't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis			0
' @entity5 took responsibility for his role in the trim down and said he could n't ' blame ' @entity13 in @entity208 who led the charge against the deregulating the banking industry			1
' this was n't something they forced me into			0
i really believed that given the level of oversight of banks and their ability to have more patient capital , if you made it possible for [ commercial banks ] to go into the investment banking business as @entity253 @entity252 investment banks could always do , that it might give us a more stable source of long - term investment , ' he said			1
the former president also backed the federal government 's bailout of banking industry giants @entity261 and @entity262 and argued that it was ' necessary ' to dig @entity264 out of the hole it had gotten itself into			1
it just did n't stem the tide because of the underlying massive amount of unsustainable debt in the real estate market , both residential and commercial , ' he said			0
in fact , @entity5 said he would have went further and offered the now defunct @entity276 a line of credit similar to what the government offered @entity280			2
progressives were quick to applaud @entity16 's remarks today after they made their way into news reports			0
' this morning , senator @entity1 clearly articulated the kind of far - reaching progressive vision @entity52 want to hear in the next presidential campaign , ' @entity285 , executive director , @entity286 said in a statement ' ultimately , that 's why more than 189,891 people across the country have already signed on to the @entity295 campaign urging her to jump into the 2016 race			0
' in his prepared speech @entity299 president @entity298 said @entity16 in ' an inspiration ' and ' her vision of a @entity304 embodies our highest ideals			0
' senator @entity16 is that rare political leader : she shares out values , she really connects with us , she is a genius when it comes to policy , and she is tough as nails when it comes to politics , ' @entity298 said , according to @entity315			0
asked later about @entity3 , @entity298 did n't offer as glowing a profile			1
' i think that @entity3 did an excellent job as secretary of state			2
i think she is very , very qualified to be president , ' he told reporters at a breakfast @entity31			0
' would i say she is the favorite now ? yes			0
but i think anytime anybody believes there is going to be a coronation , that is dangerous for the candidate .			0
