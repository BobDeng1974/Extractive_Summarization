by @entity0 @entity1 touched down in @entity2 and issued a calming message to those who were unimpressed by @entity6 's back - to - back draws against @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity6 rounded off their week - long stay in @entity10 with a storm - affected goalless stalemate against @entity8			2
that draw came three days after @entity6 failed to beat @entity7 , who exposed @entity6 's defensive frailties on the counter-attack			1
next saturday they face four - time world champions @entity26 and they then tackle @entity27 before a final game against @entity29 insists very little should be read in to the friendlies			1
' i have to say these warm - up games , i do n't know that they necessarily answer many questions , ' the @entity6 manager said			1
' you answer your questions over a long period of time			0
' when i look at the other warm - up games i am pretty certain i am not alone in thinking it 's just a way of getting yourself to @entity2 where the real tournament begins			1
' referee @entity42 handed @entity8 five yellow cards on saturday , including two for @entity44 , who was sent off in the 66th minute for a flying elbow on @entity47			2
it was therefore something of a surprise that @entity6 did not pick up any injuries			2
there were more plus points too			0
@entity53 silenced his critics with a good performance			0
@entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 did their selection chances no harm either			0
below the belt : @entity6 were fortunate not to pick up any injuries during a 0 - 0 draw with @entity8 weather or not : the game against @entity8 was delayed for 40minutes after an electrical storm in @entity10 four years ago , @entity6 arrived at the @entity67 in the eye of a storm created by injuries to key players , @entity73 's contract negotiations and the embarrassment caused by the @entity75			1
this time the squad appears united and their only injury concern is @entity78 , who has travelled to @entity24 despite suffering medial knee ligament damage against @entity7			1
' it has been three excellent weeks of preparation , ' @entity1 added			2
' the squad is growing stronger , they are bonding together very well and the mood is one of quiet optimism and a reasonable degree of confidence			0
that is all you can hope for			0
pick me ! @entity53 staked his claim for a starting place against @entity26 with a decent performance in @entity10 ' now is when the real football begins and i am happy that we are in good spirits and the players have really done as much as we could ask of them			2
' @entity100 and @entity101 have now left after spending the last three weeks with the squad			0
the standby duo have been told they could be called up at any time though if @entity78 does not demonstrate sufficient progress in his recovery from the injury to his right knee			0
@entity1 has until friday to decide whether he will replace @entity78 , and for now he is positive about the midfielder 's chances of playing some part in the tournament			1
waiting game : @entity1 is confident that @entity78 will return to fitness for the tournament ' that is what we are hoping for , ' he said			1
' but there are still a few assessments to be made on him so i would n't want to suggest that is a stone - wall certainty			0
' after their overnight flight from @entity10 , @entity6 were due to check into their hotel near @entity128 beach on sunday afternoon			0
preparation for the @entity26 game will begin in earnest on monday , when @entity6 will hold a fully - open session at their training centre at the @entity135 military base in the shadow of @entity2 landmark @entity138 mountain			1
will @entity140 start ? @entity1 claims he knows his starting xi for the opening game against @entity26 on june 14 o after three weeks together , does @entity1 have a firm idea of his starting @entity141 for the @entity26 game ? ' pretty much , yeah , ' he said			1
' in these three games certain players have performed better than others			0
now we will have to start thinking about ( the group ) games			0
' whatever team i decide to use against @entity26 will be very , very competitive and i am sure we will show the discipline and organisation we showed ( against @entity8 ) .			2

@entity1 is not concerned by @entity6 's results in their @entity67 warm - up friendlies
the @entity6 beat @entity158 but drew with @entity7 and @entity8
@entity1 insists the real business will begin at the tournament in @entity24
@entity6 boss is confident @entity78 will be fit
@entity1 claims to know his starting xi for the opening game against @entity26
