@entity0 , who was warned he was isolated in his bid to overturn a £ 1.7billion bill demanded by the @entity3 @entity0 was warned last night he was ‘ isolated ’ in his bid to overturn the £ 1.7billion bill from @entity6 – and that the @entity3 was becoming ‘ exasperated ’ with his demands			1
the prime minister was told that the issue was simply ‘ a @entity13 problem ’ and that the @entity3 would push to levy its own taxes on @entity11 citizens if he insists on refusing to pay the £ 1.7billion demanded			1
the @entity3 is demanding the payment – which it wants by december – because the @entity13 economy has performed better than expected over the past few years			1
in contrast , @entity16 is receiving a £ 790million rebate from the @entity3 as its economy struggles in a vicious downturn			0
@entity21 , a senior @entity22 mep and a vice-president of the @entity24 , said that if mr @entity0 refused to pay , the @entity25 could levy additional charges as well as withholding the @entity13 ’s historic £ 3billion - a - year rebate			1
and in a further blow to mr @entity0 , even @entity30 ’s prime minister - seen as a supporter of his @entity3 modernisation programmes - poured cold water on @entity13 ’s hopes of reducing its cash demand			1
@entity36 , who is married to @entity38 ’s son @entity37 , said : ‘ i respect that the @entity13 wants to discuss this among ministers , but there are rules that must be kept			2
‘ countries must follow the rules as they are			2
’ there were growing questions for @entity48 ’s @entity47 yesterday after the @entity3 revealed the department knew about the £ 1.7billion demand almost a week before mr @entity0 was told			1
junior treasury minister @entity51 was told on 14 october that @entity13 would have to make a significant contribution , although no sum was discussed			2
three day later , @entity13 officials were informed by the @entity3 that the figure would be £ 1.7billion			2
however , mr @entity48 was not told until last tuesday - and mr @entity0 did not find out until thursday , as he was being driven to a @entity6 summit			1
@entity30 prime minister @entity36 , who has poured cold water on @entity13 's chances of having its cash demanded reduced it has also emerged that ministers had known for months that a significant recalculation of the @entity13 ’s contribution to the @entity3 was on the way			1
as far back as march , former treasury minister @entity66 said in a letter that the government was giving ‘ high priority ’ to addressing the impact of the changes			0
mr @entity48 is due to raise the @entity3 demand at a meeting with the @entity22 finance minister in @entity75 today			1
mr @entity21 , who sits in the same @entity11 @entity24 grouping as the @entity77 ’ sole @entity21 , said there was no excuse for @entity13 politicians not to have known about the fee			0
@entity48 , pictured , was not told until last tuesday about the @entity3 and mr @entity0 did not find out until thursday ‘ this has been mishandled by the @entity13 government , ’ he told the @entity83 ’s @entity82			1
‘ we are really a little bit exasperated here in @entity6			0
‘ this is a @entity13 problem			1
the @entity47 could have informed the prime minister before he came to @entity6 about this thing			2
‘ it is a @entity13 problem that has now transferred to a @entity11 one			1
it ’s a @entity13 affair that should be resolved in @entity13 and it should be paid up to the @entity3 ’s budget			2
’ he said paying up was ‘ non-negotiatable ’ - and told mr @entity96 has no allies			0
‘ it looks very much as if the @entity13 is alone on this , ’ he said			0
mr @entity21 warned : ‘ if you think the system is crazy , the system of financing the @entity3 , you are opening a @entity103 in which the @entity13 rebate will come on to the table , in which the creation of an @entity3 tax on all member states will be discussed			1
junior treasury minister @entity51 was told on 14 october that @entity13 would have to make a significant contribution , although no sum was discussed ‘ i do n’t think that @entity13 citizens will want to pay an @entity3 tax proper			1
’ last night the think tank @entity113 said the @entity13 people would never accept a system of @entity3 taxes			2
‘ while the current system of national contributions is messy and frustrating , any form of direct @entity3 taxation would be a leap in the wrong direction , ’ she said			0
‘ in addition to huge practical questions about how such taxes would function – there is a risk certain countries or economic sectors could be hit disproportionately - they would have no democratic legitimacy			0
‘ the central problem with the @entity3 budget is that it is overly complex and wasteful ; the new @entity25 and @entity136 should work on fundamentally reforming this rather than dreaming up new ways to hit taxpayers			0
’ @entity141 backbencher @entity140 said the £ 1.7billion demand was in itself a ‘ massive retrospective bill on the @entity13 people ’			0
‘ they ’re seriously suggesting that the @entity13 parliament passes some kind of super @entity11 tax and send a bill to everybody , ’ he said			0
‘ i think they ’re absolutely crazy			0
‘ the @entity13 is paying too much ; it can not afford a retrospective tax , which would be a direct tax on the @entity13 people			0
‘ because the government would be borrowing , it does n’t have a pot of money saved for this purpose			0
’ @entity30 is one of the winners from the adjustments to national contributions being imposed by the @entity25 , and is in line to receive £ 253 million .			0
