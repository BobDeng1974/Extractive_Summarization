by @entity0 teacher yesterday backed a major escalation of strike action which could close thousands of schools during the summer term			1
chanting ‘ @entity9 must go ’ , activists from the @entity7 – the most militant classroom union – voted overwhelmingly for a national strike unless ministers agree to a series of demands on pensions and automatic pay rises			1
delegates at the @entity7 ’s annual conference in @entity18 passed an emergency motion which demanded strike action in the week beginning june 23 unless ‘ significant ’ progress is made in resolving the long - running dispute with the government			1
exams : the @entity7 has vowed to step up their campaign of industrial action , starting with a week in june when at least 12 gcse or a-level exams are scheduled ( @entity29 photo ) the summer strikes will overlap with the end of the exam season , although the union insisted its intention is not to disrupt tests			1
staff would be able to cross picket lines in the event of a clash with an exam , the @entity7 said			2
last month a national strike forced the closure of 3,000 schools and pushed thousands more on to reduced timetables			0
conference delegates also raised the prospect of a series of walkouts during the autumn term and in 2015 as they step up their campaign against government reforms			1
proposing the motion , the @entity7 ’s treasurer , @entity52 , branded education secretary @entity9 a ‘ demented dalek on speed ’			1
the campaign is mainly aimed at derailing the introduction of performance - related pay and changes to pension rules , and tackling ‘ excessive ’ workloads			0
' must go ' : delegates chanted ' @entity9 must go ' at the end of the annual @entity7 conference , held today in @entity18 , in reference to education secretary @entity9 the new system of performance - related pay , due to be introduced in september , would bring automatic pay rises to an end , with schools given the flexibility to offer higher salaries to their best teachers			1
under the old system teachers were previously virtually guaranteed £ 2,000 annual rises			0
but under the new system salary rises will be linked to annual appraisals instead of length of service			0
teachers will be expected to show they have achieved good results with their pupils and kept order in the classroom			0
but the @entity7 claims the new system is ‘ unfair ’ and will lead to pay cuts for many because of budget constraints			2
changes to pensions would make them less generous and mean teachers retiring later			0
the strike resolution was backed by a large majority of delegates at the conference yesterday but was not passed unanimously			1
afterwards , delegates stood up cheering and chanting : ‘ @entity9 must go			1
’ the motion leaves ‘ flexibility ’ for any summer walkout to be longer than a day , although a one - day strike was thought to be the most likely scenario			2
about one in eight schools in @entity103 was forced to close fully when the @entity7 staged a one - day walkout last month , according to government estimates , although it is thought that many more were partially shut			1
the @entity107 , the other big teaching union , also left open the possibility of a strike at its conference in @entity112 but did not set a date			2
if it joined with the @entity7 , thousands more schools would be affected			2
at least a dozen @entity116 and a-level papers are scheduled for the first two days of the week proposed in the @entity7 ’s resolution , with one advanced maths extension paper scheduled for the wednesday of that week			1
@entity7 general secretary @entity119 said : ‘ strike action will not disrupt exams			1
if necessary , exemptions can be given to staff who are needed to supervise an exam , but the @entity7 is looking to take action at the end of the main exam season			2
’ but miss @entity119 admitted that a june strike would could cause disruption			0
‘ of course parents will say this is inconvenient , it is inconvenient , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s actually in the nature of industrial action that you do it because you want to cause inconvenience because you ’re trying to bring your grievances to people ’s attention			1
’ in a controversial speech , mr @entity52 described mr @entity9 as ‘ a parody of an @entity9 ’			0
he continued : ‘ @entity144 , the man with a mad idea for every occasion			0
‘ @entity9 , the demented dalek on speed who wants to exterminate anything good in education that ’s come along since the 1950s			0
@entity9 , the man who says he wants to set schools free and then sends in the @entity153 inquisition			0
’ a @entity155 spokesman said : ‘ ministers have met frequently with the @entity7 and other unions and will continue to do so			1
‘ further strike action will only disrupt parents ’ lives , hold back children ’s education and damage the reputation of the profession			2
‘ we know that the vast majority of our teachers and school leaders are hard - working and dedicated professionals			0
‘ that is why we are giving teachers more freedoms than ever and cutting unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy			0

@entity7 vows to step up industrial action if ' significant ' progress is not made in long - running dispute
