by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent you remain as young as you feel – and it is just as well … our healthier lifestyles and better medicine are helping more of us than ever live past the age of 100			1
for the first time , the number of centenarians in @entity10 has passed the 13,000 mark			1
official statistics released yesterday show that 13,350 of us were aged 100 or more when the latest figures were collected in 2012			2
healthier lifestyles and better medication are helping more of us than ever live past the age of 100 of these , 660 were at least 105 years old – which is another record			1
and there are now half a million people in @entity10 aged 90 or more			1
the number of centenarians has risen by 73 per cent in the last decade alone			2
and life expectancy for the next generation is also rising			1
a newborn girl can expect to live to the age of 82.6 , and a boy to 78.7 – almost six years longer for a girl and eight years longer for a boy than at the beginning of the 1980s			2
just before the @entity31 , there were only 100 centenarians in the whole of @entity10			1
when @entity35 sent out the first congratulatory telegrams to centenarians in 1917 , there were only 24			2
now @entity38 is sending out around 10,000 laser - printed royal 100th birthday cards a year			0
new figures reveal for the first time the number of centenarians in @entity10 has passed 13,000 those who were aged 100 or more in 2012 are certainly hardy – to get to this age they faced many perilous challenges in their early years			1
they survived the @entity31 , the deadly 1919 flu epidemic , the high mortality rates of the 1920s and 1930s and then the @entity51			0
the increase in numbers living into great old age began in the 1950s and has accelerated in recent years			0
the analysis by the @entity56 found : ‘ the chance of surviving to older ages has increased for both males and females over recent decades , contributing to the rising numbers of those aged 90 and over in the population			2
‘ mortality rates at older ages have improved due to a combination of factors such as improved medical treatments , housing and living standards , nutrition and changes in the population ’s smoking habits			0
’ people are living longest in @entity75 , where life expectancy for boys born now is 79 and for women it is 82.8			1
@entity79 still has the lowest life expectancy in the @entity10 , at 76.5 for a boy and 80.7 for a girl			1
in @entity84 life expectancy for newborns is 78.1 for boys and 82.1 for girls , while in @entity89 it is 77.7 for boys and 82.1 for girls			1
yesterday ’s statistics also showed the average amount of years we spend in good health , based on a self - assessment in the 2011 national census			0
judging by respondents ’ answers on the state of their health at that time , it was estimated that a newborn girl can expect to spend 64.8 years in good health , while for baby boys it is 63.5 years			0
but there are major regional differences between expectancies of good health			0
in @entity110 and in @entity111 in @entity112 , baby girls can expect to enjoy 71.3 years in good health , while for boys it is 70.3 years			0
but in @entity117 a healthy life expectancy for a man is just 52.5 years and 51.6 years for women			1
@entity119 , of the charity @entity120 , said : ‘ the stunning 73 per cent increase in the number of centenarians is a massive cause for celebration			2
@entity38 is sending out is sending out around 10,000 laser - printed royal 100th birthday cards a year			0
when the latest figures were collected in 2012 , the data revealed there were 13,350 centenarians in the @entity10 ‘ it is particularly good news for older men – there are far more men aged 90 or over than ten years ago , and women over 90 now outnumber men by just 2.5 to 1 , compared to 3.3 to 1 ten years ago			1
these trends are expected to continue – it is estimated that half the five - year - olds alive today will live to 100			2
‘ yet , we are woefully under - prepared to meet the challenges – and indeed seize the opportunities – presented by population ageing			0
‘ urgent action is needed in health and social care , in work , in lifestyles and in our attitudes if we are to adjust to an ageing society			0
’ the life expectancy of men is gradually catching up with that of women , the @entity56 figures show			1
the narrowing of the gap between men and women is in line with the decline of heavy industry and manual labour , which means fewer men work in dangerous physical jobs			2
also , more women are exposed to the stress of holding down careers and more are likely to indulge in risky behaviour such as heavy drinking			0
een life expectancy for men and women was six years in the early 1980s , but has narrowed to 3.9 years			1
the @entity56 said that ‘ males are demonstrating faster improvements ’ in their lifespans than women			0
a recent indicator suggesting there may be growing pressure on the health of women showed that mortality rates have failed to improve for some working women aged between 25 and 59			0
the professions affected included women working in sales , as counter clerks , clerical grade workers in local government and the public sector , medical and dental technicians , and some creative industries such as graphic designers .			0
