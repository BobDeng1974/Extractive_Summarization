’ the @entity24 said the @entity7 doll is not something that it would officially approve , although sources suggested any legal action to prevent it going on sale is unlikely			0
the doll is not tipped to top the @entity35 toy sales charts , though			1
favourite to be the best seller , according to the @entity71 ’s @entity70 , is another doll , the @entity73 by @entity74 , which can take off and fly thanks to its rotating petal - like wings			1
