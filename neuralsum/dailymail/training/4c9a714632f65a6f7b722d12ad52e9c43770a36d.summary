reindeer owners are attempting to keep the locations of @entity2 displays secret to avoid intervention from animal rights activists			1
the @entity6 in @entity7 has supplied animals for festive parades across the country for decades			1
but , after animal rights group @entity12 bombarded local authorities with letters asking they do not use the animals in @entity2 events , the herd has asked well - wishers not to reveal which displays they plan to attend			1
the @entity6 participates in events hosted by some of the local authorities which received the letter			1
but the herd fears it is being considered in the same way as organisations which transports thousands of reindeer from @entity37 into captivity			1
in a bid to avoid any intervention or disruption , it asked fans on its @entity45 page not to refer to the locations of its jobs on the social media site			1
' can we ask you all to please not mention any the locations of any of our @entity2 parades here on @entity45 , as we do n't want any of their organisers to get targeted by animal rights folks			1
' we know our reindeer are very happy and comfortable in their work - otherwise we would n't take them to the parades - as we are the ones who work with them day in , day out and know them all extremely well , ' a post on november 1 read			2
the group is the only free - roaming herd in the @entity69 and has participated in @entity2 events for decades speaking of the unusual request , worker @entity71 said : ' we feel it would open a can of worms if we publicised where we are going			1
' we 're erring on the side of caution by asking people not to mention details			2
we believe the protesters are aiming to stop venues from hiring us			0
' these places might decide they ca n't be bothered by the hassle and will stop inviting us			0
it 's putting pressure on them			0
' without the money we make from this time of year , we would struggle to care for the reindeer and pay our staff			0
' we feel worn out by it all , to be honest			0
the reindeer bring a huge amount of joy , but there 's a blackness in the background just now because of it			0
' campaigners slammed the request , saying organisers were trying to hide ' unethical displays '			0
' when someone asks their customers to be secretive , you know they 've got something to hide , ' @entity101 , a @entity12 spokesman said , rejecting the group 's claim that they are a free - roaming herd			1
' reindeer are not " free - roaming " if they are being carted all over the country , jammed into pens , tied up with reins , and forced to pull sleighs			1
' we should not be supporting such unethical displays			0
children should not grow up thinking that animals exist merely for our entertainment or that they must work for their upkeep			2
' the holiday season is supposed to be about joy and peace			0
ending the exploitation of reindeer and other animals would do nothing to diminish children 's sense of the magic of the holiday season			2
' earlier this year @entity12 campaign coordinator @entity129 penned a letter to numerous local authorities asking them not to involve reindeer in parades she deemed ' entirely unsuitable '			1
' a busy commercial centre filled with noisy shoppers , bright lights and excited children is an entirely unsuitable environment for reindeer or any other animals			2
' these beautiful animals belong in the @entity144 and subarctic regions of the world			2
' owners say their animals are ' very happy and comfortable in their work '			0
the reindeer are pictured in their free - roaming habitat in the @entity151 where tourists can visit them throughout the year animal rights group @entity12 argues it is unsuitable for reindeer to be around ' bright lights and excited children ' the group said the species ' belongs in the @entity144 and subarctic regions of the world ' and not in town centres while the @entity161 acknowledges there are organisations which import reindeer to poor conditions in the @entity69 , their animals are not unhappy with the work they carry out and bring ' a huge amount of joy ' ' when they â€™re used as holiday " props " reindeer are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviour or roam freely over vast open ranges as they would in their natural circumpolar habitat , ' the reindeer from the @entity161 are the only ones in the country which enjoy a free - roaming habitat in the @entity151			1
during the year they are visited by groups of tourists in the wild , and , say organisers , interact with humans willingly			0
when travelling to events across the country , they stay in temporary , farmland bases and are transported in lorries with spacious boxes of straw .			0

the @entity6 has asked people ' not to mention ' its events
fears disruption by animal rights groups claiming parades are unsuitable
