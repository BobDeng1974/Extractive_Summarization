by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 5 may 2012 updated : 19:43 est , 5 may 2012 a vigilante border patrol group has sworn that it will continue guarding the @entity4 - @entity3 border despite the death of its neo-nazi leader in a horrific murder - suicide			1
friends of @entity11 ' @entity10 vowed friday that @entity4 @entity13 's armed patrols will continue , but monitoring groups doubted the operations could be sustained			1
authorities say the 39 - year - old @entity10 shot and killed his girlfriend and three others , including a toddler , before killing himself in a @entity21 suburb on wednesday in a murder - suicide which stemmed from domestic violence			1
it has now emerged that he was being investigated by the @entity25 over terrorism claims and allegations he had stolen weapons from the military			0
carry on : friends of @entity11 ' @entity10 vowed friday that @entity4 @entity13 's armed patrols will continue , but monitoring groups doubted the operations could be sustained victims : @entity32 with her daughter @entity33 , two , were shot and killed as was @entity10 's girlfriend @entity34 , 47 , who had been living with him at the time ; @entity10 then turned the gun on himself the @entity37 reported on its website saturday that the @entity25 was already conducting a domestic terrorism investigation into @entity10 's activities prior to the shootings			1
@entity42 , special agent in charge of the @entity25 's @entity21 office , told the paper that the @entity25 's investigation dated to when @entity10 was a member of the @entity47 and continued into his participation with the border group			1
he stressed that it had nothing to do with this week 's shootings			2
however , the @entity25 probe into @entity10 's activities as head of the @entity13 could cast doubt on the remaining members ' vows to continue his legacy			1
an affidavit accused him of possessing weapons which were ' most likely stolen from the military as they are illegal to possess and not available to the civilian market '			0
at work : @entity10 argues with ' observers ' from civil - rights groups who monitored his controversial organisation watching : @entity10 scours the border for immigrants as part of his efforts with the ' @entity4 border guard ' coupled with the labelling of the @entity13 as a ' hate group ' by anti-racism bodies , the revelations could make it increasingly difficult for the border vigilantes to continue their patrols without attracting the attention of authorities but @entity83 , a 35 - year - old @entity84 man who said @entity10 was like a brother to him , said he would quit his job to keep the group going			1
' he did a lot for this country as far as protecting the border , something the government does n't do , ' @entity88 said			0
' i think it 's good to have civilians stopping the drug market			0
' groups that monitor the activities of organizations like the @entity4 @entity13 expressed doubts that it will be able to maintain its operations			1
without @entity10 's leadership , they say , the @entity13 will likely disappear			1
' the @entity4 @entity13 is probably finished , ' said @entity104 of the anti-hate group , the @entity106			1
' it really did revolve around @entity108			2
' dispute : police have said that there had been a reported incident of domestic violence between @entity10 , pictured left , and @entity34 earlier in the day patrolling : @entity115 volunteer ready , pictured at the @entity4 / @entity3 border west of @entity117 , @entity118 in 2005 an @entity106 recent report said that ' nativist extremist ' groups like @entity10 's decreased by almost half in 2011 to 184 groups , down from a high of 319 such groups in 2010			1
the @entity115 and other similar groups have been plagued by infighting and financial difficulties , largely splintering or disintegrating altogether			0
the movement 's decline comes as states like @entity118 passed harsh immigration laws that included provisions allowing local police to question a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws , @entity104 said			0
those laws created an impression among some civilian border militia members that state governments were doing more about illegal immigration , and that they no longer had to , he said			0
@entity143 , interim director the @entity118 chapter of the immigrant advocacy group , the @entity142 , said that organizations like @entity10 's thrive on a charismatic leader , and tend to implode once that leader is gone			1
distraught : a police officer walks with a man who said he had a child inside of the home where five people were shot earlier this week horror : @entity157 police officers walk inside the police tape outside a crime scene on wednesday after four people , including a toddler , were fatally shot family : @entity32 , boyfriend @entity163 and daughter @entity33 were all shot			1
@entity33 was still alive when police arrived but died later in the hospital ' what brings hate groups together is anger and fear			0
so it makes sense that they would start to direct that toward one another , ' she said			0
' they also attract a lot of people that want to be mega personalities			0
' and it ends up being their own worst enemy â€” fighting over the limelight , ' she said			0
the @entity106 also cites the case of @entity187 , a former member of the @entity189			0
she was convicted in a may 2009 home invasion that left a 9 - year - old girl and her father dead			2
prosecutors said the invasion was an attempt to steal drug money to fund her group 's border operations			2
@entity200 was expelled from the @entity198 in 2007 amid allegations of lying and pretending to be a senior leader			2
at the time of the killings , she was the head of her own group called the @entity207			2
political arena : in january , @entity10 announced his candidacy to run as a @entity211 candidate for @entity212 the @entity106 's report said the killings cast a pall over the entire civilian border militia movement			2
but @entity10 began patrolling the desert with his group after the killings , dressing up in head - to - toe camouflage gear , helmets and boots , and carrying high - powered guns as they traveled out into the desert to look for illegal immigrants or smugglers			1
' after we pay our last respects and get our ducks back in a row , i 'm pretty sure business will continue			0
i do n't think @entity233 would have wanted us to stop			0
' @entity88 said that he never joined the group on patrols , but that he and @entity10 would go out with a handful of others about a dozen times a year on similar outings			1
@entity88 and other friends of @entity10 's said they are reluctant to believe that he killed four people and himself , and say they feel drug cartels are more likely to blame even though police have discounted that possibility			2
police say all the evidence points to a domestic - violence situation			0
those killed in the rampage in @entity157 on wednesday were @entity10 's girlfriend , her daughter ; her 16 - month - old granddaughter ; and her daughter 's boyfriend			1
@entity256 , another close friend of @entity10 's and a regional director with the @entity258 - based @entity47 , said he plans to continue his own one - to - two man desert patrols			1
members of the @entity47 promote white separatism , dress like @entity263 and display swastikas			0
they believe only @entity266 , white heterosexuals should be citizens and that anyone who is n't white should leave ' peacefully or by force			0
' @entity10 was a former member of the group who said he quit to focus on his desert patrols			1
' just because mr @entity10 is no longer with us does n't mean we 're going to stop , ' @entity256 said			2
' after we pay our last respects and get our ducks back in a row , i 'm pretty sure business will continue			0
' he added , ' i do n't think @entity233 would have wanted us to stop			0

@entity108 , leader of @entity4 @entity13 , shot dead his girlfriend and three others earlier this week before turning gun on himself
authorities say group can not exist without @entity10 , but group insists they will continue in his memory
