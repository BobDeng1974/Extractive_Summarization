these are the faces of a continent - africa up close and personal			2
the tight frames they are shot in barely seem to hold these people as they stand proud and stark against deep black backgrounds			2
the images are the work of @entity8 , a 38 - year - old photographer who has spent much of the past decade travelling around south , east and @entity9 , pointing his camera at the most unforgettable faces he can find			1
there is the young @entity14 girl from @entity15 who illustrates the obsessive pride the women of the tribe take in their hair thanks to the colourful beads , shells and animal oils woven into its strands			1
a girl from the @entity27 tribe in eastern @entity28 wears a striking , sequined headscarf			1
one day she will likely carry an umbrella to shield her from the sun like many older @entity27 women			0
the girl on the right is from the @entity41 tribe and is pictured in @entity42			1
they are traditionally nomadic cattle - herders and traders in the @entity45 a girl from the @entity27 tribe in eastern @entity28 wears a striking , sequined headscarf ( left )			1
one day she will likely carry an umbrella to shield her from the sun like many older @entity27 women			0
some of the colours worn by the subjects like the girl on the right are stunning a woman from the @entity55 , a @entity57 - speaking ethnic group inhabiting @entity59 's @entity58 ( left )			1
a lady from @entity28 's @entity35 tribe ( right )			1
along with the two countries @entity8 has also travelled to @entity63 , @entity28 , @entity59 , @entity64 , @entity15 , @entity42 , @entity65 and @entity66 and there is a young @entity35 girl , also from @entity28 , whose neck is festooned with hundreds of tiny glass beads and dainty white shells			1
it seems as if there 's no room for any more jewellery but as she has yet to find a husband or have a proposal accepted by her father , there are none of the metal necklaces worn from engagement onwards that denote the social status of married women			2
@entity8 has travelled round 13 @entity88 countries photographing traditional tribesmen and women			1
these include @entity63 , @entity28 , @entity59 , @entity64 , @entity15 , @entity42 , @entity65 and @entity66 on an odyssey which began in 2006 when he made his first six - month trip to @entity9			1
the end result of these years of work in tribal @entity88 societies is a book , ‘ @entity98 ’ , that was released in late 2013			0
back in 2006 , he says , ' at the very start of my @entity9 journey , i was buzzing with energy having met people of real magnetism just days into my trip			2
these young @entity14 girls from @entity15 illustrate the obsessive pride the women of the tribe take in their hair thanks to the colourful beads , shells and animal oils woven into its strands			1
@entity8 travelled through 13 countries to capture intense subjects like these this mother and child are from the @entity122 ethnic group in @entity28			1
the man is from the @entity125 people in the same country			0
there are only around 30,000 of them and many are @entity125 are nomadic , residing in mobile livestock villages that may migrate several times a year this lady is also from the @entity125 people ( left )			0
the girl on the right from @entity42 is a member of the @entity136 people ' i was excited by extraordinary people and fascinating cultures and wondered how i could possibly communicate and express these feelings of excitement to friends and family back home			1
' @entity8 's solution was to remove his subjects from all context , shooting them indoors away from what he calls the ' dull and dusty backgrounds of their immediate environment '			1
he adds : ' i started to imagine each of these people in front of me emerging from the nothingness of darkness , with no distractions , hoping that this would provide a real feeling of proximity between the viewer and the person in the picture			0
' the result is to bring out the vividness of the colours and the immediacy of the people 's expressions - sometimes playful , often intense but always arresting			2
@entity8 says : ' it 's simply the illumination of natural sunlight , and sun on dry earth , that reaches into the darkness of huts and lights up these remarkable people			0
this man is a @entity41 tribe member ( left ) from @entity42 who are traditionally nomadic cattle - herders and traders in the @entity45			1

this girl from the @entity198 tribe in @entity63 ( right ) has n't reached puberty yet so she is wearing two plaits ' @entity201 and dry earth are the only ingredients required for the lighting in my prints			2
' in @entity9 i seem to have made it my goal to travel through some of the remotest areas of the continent where the reaches of urbanisation and 21st century living are barely detectable			0
' @entity8 was shot at in northern @entity59 in 2009			1
he and his guide were driving along a highway one evening when they glimpsed tiny white flashes ahead of them and were soon engulfed in gunfire			0
@entity8 ducked down just in time as a bullet missed his face by only a few inches			0
but the experience has done nothing to dampen his enthusiasm for capturing the rural people of the continent in all their startling beauty			0
