teenagers from across the country have dreamed up inventions from play parks that generate power to wardrobes that choose an outfit , in a bid to make life ‘ better , simpler and easier ’ in the future			1
whimsical ideas entered for @entity11 include a pen that spots spelling mistakes , and a way to grow your own clothes			1
other designs , which have been presented at @entity18 in @entity19 today , aimed to solve some of society ’s more pressing problems and give people suffering from dementia , for example , extra care			1
teenagers have dreamed up inventions of the future , including a pen that spots spelling mistakes , for @entity11			1
the ' spellomatic pen ' was the brainchild of ( from left to right ) @entity33 ( 14 ) , @entity34 ( 13 ) and @entity35 ( 14 ) from @entity36 in @entity37 the overall winners were students from @entity40 in @entity41 with their idea to make cars safer by lowering the risk of slipping in bad conditions			1
@entity46 and @entity47 , both 15 , explained : ' we ’re both keen motorsports fans and were chatting about the cars in a maths lesson			1
' our idea was that if a fan was used to suck the car down to the road , traction levels would be higher so in wet or icy conditions , the car would be a lot safer			1
' ' after winning the @entity59 we ’re now itching for the next step of commercialising the idea			1
we ’re looking for further partners in the auto industry to bring this to reality			2
' the awards is part of a drive by scientists and educators to increase the number of teenagers obtaining qualifications in science , technology , engineering and mathematics – known as stem subjects			2
a total of one hundred teenagers from across the @entity81 were picked to present their work to a team of judges , who included @entity86 ’s @entity85 , @entity87 , tv presenters @entity88 and @entity90 , as well as academics			1

' trends moves so quickly these days , that as people try to keep up with fashion , their old clothes just get wasted ... we wanted to create a biodegradable material that was affordable and on - trend and could be grown by anybody , ' they said			0
to do this , the pupils mixed green tea with sugar and cider vinegar to create a culture that creates thin layers of fibres			0
it takes up to a month to develop and the resulting fabric can be dyed naturally with beetroot juice			0

@entity186 designed the anklet to give people with dementia more freedom and family members peace of mind that their relative is safe			2
she won the healthcare category in the competition last year with a blood glucose monitor for diabetics , and is currently raising money to put it into production			0
a team of students from @entity204 , @entity205 , invented the @entity206 for deaf people			2
using built - in microphones , the glove would translate speech into text , which is displayed on a touchscreen			0
the person using the glove could either speak back naturally or even use the glove to reply in another language of their choice			0
