lucky escape : this postcard , showing the sleepy @entity25 fishing town of @entity26 , formed part of @entity7 's invasion plan of @entity10 , dubbed ' @entity29 ' an idyllic scene featuring seaside revellers enjoying the stunning coast of @entity33 , which was used by @entity7 to try and gain an advantage in the war @entity9 plans of attack			1
this map of the east coast of the @entity39 , annotated with landing points for @entity5 troops , is a chilling illustration of what might have been industrial areas to the north of @entity46			1

the images were contained alongside annotated maps of the @entity68 in eight booklets called @entity71 uber @entity73 information about @entity73			2
the booklets were broken down into eight regions of @entity10 and were incredibly detailed , highlighting things like strategic locations to attack to the make up of soil			2

an aerial map of @entity86 highlights railways , storage sheds and @entity68 administrative offices as places of note to @entity5 military strategists local municipal institutions like police stations and train stations were highlighted in red triangles and industrial sites such as factories were shown up in purple			1

a few years later the same women would be conscripted to the @entity127 to help with the war effort one of eight chilling documents ( left ) reads ' @entity73 information about @entity73 ' while intricate plans and maps were drawn up based on the information gathered @entity134 , of @entity103 - based @entity135 auctioneers , said : ' these briefing booklets were printed in preparation for @entity29 , the @entity5 invasion of @entity10 which thankfully never came to pass			1
' this is probably the most extensive collection of these booklets to come up at auction			0

pre-war photograph of @entity103 including @entity152 docks and @entity153			0
the caption underneath reads ' storm and lightening ' - a horrifying glimpse at things to come during the blitz by @entity9 forces ' along with maps and photographs , the booklets detail particular regions and sites to be besieged , including major @entity103 train stations and industrial areas			2
' the collection gives us a very real indication of the extensive knowledge @entity170 had of the @entity172			0
