all driving licences expire when the holder turns 70			0

@entity178 - @entity177 , of road safety charity brake , said : ‘ statistically , older drivers are less likely to be involved in a crash as they are more experienced and tend to take fewer risks			0
‘ however ... @entity182 believes fitness to drive regulations need to be strengthened to prevent needless tragedies , particularly through the introduction of compulsory sight checks			0
‘ when someone admits causing death by their own careless driving , it should warrant a penalty that properly reflects the severity of the crime and its impact on others			1
‘ anything less is likely to serve as an insult to bereaved families , and does little to encourage people to take greater care behind the wheel and prevent future tragedies			0
