by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 17:29 est , 7 august 2013 ' liar ' : @entity3 repeatedly told the patient that her tumour had been removed even though it was still there , the tribunal heard a surgeon ‘ lied and lied and lied ’ to a woman with a brain tumour by claiming he had removed it , a tribunal heard yesterday			1
@entity3 told the woman he had successfully removed the entire growth when he had removed only a tiny sample for a biopsy			1
after lying to her he convinced her not to seek further treatment for two years after the operation by insisting she was absolutely fine			0
by the time the woman decided to seek private treatment for her problem , the lesion on her brain was inoperable			1
yesterday a @entity26 hearing was told mr @entity3 had repeatedly lied to the patient , identified as @entity28 , after carrying out the operation at the @entity30 in september 2008			1
@entity32 , @entity33 , for the @entity31 , told the hearing : ‘ it is difficult to understand why mr @entity3 initially told the patient and her husband that he had completely removed the lesion when he must have known that no such thing had happened			1
' he then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure			1
’ the misconduct hearing was told that after lying to @entity28 he forged and falsified documents and also lied to medical colleagues			1
@entity3 , 58 , who qualified in @entity44 in 1981 , even sent letters to the patient ’s gp telling him that no further treatment was necessary , it was said			1
the hearing in @entity50 was told that @entity28 had fallen ill on holiday in november 2007 , experiencing double vision , and booked an appointment with her optician			2
she was then referred to the @entity30 where an mri scan revealed she had a tumour about one inch in diameter in her brain			1
the woman , who saw @entity3 to discuss her options for treatment in june 2008 , told the hearing : ‘ my first questions were , “ is it accessible ? is it operable ? ” and , “ is there anything you can do about it ? ” surgeon : @entity3 treated the woman at @entity30 - then repeatedly lied that her tumour had been removed ‘ he said , “ oh yes			1
that ’s the only way to find out ” , so i was confident the surgery would go well and i would find out what was causing the double vision			2
’ she added : ‘ i was under the impression that he was going to remove the tumour			2
’ after the neurosurgeon operated in september 2008 he told her that he had removed 100 per cent of the tumour , she said			1
‘ he said , “ it ’s all gone ”			0
he said it was just calcium deposits			0
that ’s how he described it , ’ she told the hearing			0
mr @entity32 said : ‘ mr @entity3 gave @entity28 ’s husband a vivid description of how he had removed the tumour			1
in fact he had not excised the lesion at all			0
’ the hearing was told that @entity3 had removed only four tiny hard pale fragments when he knew the tumour was an inch in diameter			1
in his medical notes he simply recorded that ‘ biopsies ’ of the tumour had been taken			2
' he then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure and the @entity31 will therefore invite you to conclude that is what has happened ' @entity108 , for the @entity31 mr @entity32 said there was no explanation as to why @entity3 had told the patient he had removed the entire tumour			1
‘ the only explanation is he was being dishonest , ’ he said			0
‘ there is no clinical justification not to tell the truth to @entity28 or her gp			0
mr @entity3 acted dishonestly in asserting what he knew was not true			2
’ in january 2009 the surgeon is said to have altered a pathology report and sent a forged copy to his patient in order to conceal the fact she might need further treatment			2
two months later he failed to tell @entity28 that another mri scan she had had showed the tumour was in fact unchanged			1
the @entity31 claims he did not tell her this because he wanted to conceal the fact he had not removed the lesion in the first place			0
@entity3 then changed his stance after a third @entity127 , telling patient a and her gp that the lesion had returned , when he knew there had been no change			2
he again changed his tune in may 2010 , now telling patient a that he had not known the tumour was present when he operated on her and giving her another doctored pathology report , the panel heard			0
@entity28 raised concerns about her treatment and the medical director at @entity30 ordered an investigation			0
when asked about his actions in 2011 , the surgeon allegedly continued to lie to bosses , claiming ‘ he did not want to cause further stress to the patient ’			0
‘ he was given the opportunity to come clean about the lies he had told and elected to not do so , ’ said mr @entity32			0
@entity3 , of @entity30 , faces 11 allegations relating to his conduct			2
after a failed application to be voluntarily erased from the medical register , he withdrew from proceedings and is not present or represented at the hearing			0
he is currently able to work within the @entity167 subject to conditions that keep him closely monitored by a professional regulator			0
if found guilty of misconduct he could be struck off the medical register			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
