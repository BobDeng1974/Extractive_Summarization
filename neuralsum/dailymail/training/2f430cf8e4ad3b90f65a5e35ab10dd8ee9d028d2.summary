it 's those two things that landed the singles ladies of @entity9 on reality tv to begin with			2
five in all , the growing and glowing women in we tv 's latest lineup play mini-golf , lace up bowling shoes and enjoy romantic non-alcoholic outings , but the mere idea of dating while pregnant has earned them a bit of snark			2
' i see @ @entity14 has a show called # pregnantanddating			1
you straight people really are something else , ' tweeted gay comedian @entity28			1
and then there 's the subject of sex , which the show 's moms - to - be are happy to mull on air			1
it 's also the subject that generated a gross - out factor among some on social media			2
but is dating while pregnant really all that wacky ? in a recent @entity0 - @entity14 poll , 23 percent of men said they would consider starting a relationship with a woman who is pregnant			1
among online dating options are a few sites promoting pregnant sex , hookups and even one offering ' pregnant naughty chat			2
' dating was n't about sex for @entity64 , a model - turned - stylist in @entity66			2
divorced , she attempted to have a baby on her own through a donor when she and her boyfriend of three years began trying together , and voila ! ' about two months into my pregnancy i noticed that he posted he was in a relationship with somebody else on @entity76 , ' she said in a recent telephone interview			2
dating , she said , was ' about getting to know people and really finding out who they are , and for the first time in my life being confident to know my boundaries and what it is that that person would need to deliver in order to be in my life			1

' nail technician @entity90 , 28 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , gets a romantic kiss or two from an old flame while out and about during her pregnancy on the show			1
she 's more than a little curious to know whether her late - term hormones would make sex that much better , but she said in an interview that she ultimately resisted			0
' i definitely do n't have sex on the show and that 's not the point of dating , ' @entity90 said			1
' the point was to find somebody who you can spend time with and who can be a life partner , not to have sex while dating			0
' the women , including swimsuit model @entity195 in @entity197 , @entity198 , and 43 - year - old @entity199 , a tv and film producer in @entity99 who was expecting twins , bring their own baggage to the show			1
