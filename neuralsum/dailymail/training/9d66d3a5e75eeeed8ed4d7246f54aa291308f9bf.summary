by @entity0 a @entity2 adventurer who traced the longest river in @entity4 from source to sea , has described it as ' dicing with death '			1
@entity9 walked , kayaked and biked along the waterway - from the snowy mountainous headwaters of the south west to the @entity12 - in a country still largely shrouded in mystery			1
the film student was welcomed into @entity4 homes and subject to startling acts of kindness and generosity in a state former @entity22 president @entity21 conversely named part of the ' axis of evil '			2
frosty toes : @entity9 treks upstream through the snow of the @entity27 a kind benefactor loaned @entity9 a bicycle and other equipment when the rapids of the @entity32 became too dangerous to boat down			1
mr @entity9 said : ' a lot of @entity4 would often say anything is possible in @entity4 , it is their motto and one has to agree ; within 20 minutes we were fully kitted out for a bicycle expedition , we had to promise to have lots of fun and take pictures to send back to him			0
' the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) advises against all but essential travel to @entity4 , but tour operators have reportedly seen a rise in holiday bookings to this wild and wistful destination			0
catch me if you can : the intrepid explorer packing a pace and a hefty rucksack as he heads into the mountains the expedition earlier this year took more than a month , and mr @entity9 intends to document a film about his 450 - mile adventure along the river 's course			1
he walked for a week along the banks of the river from its source until it became wide and deep enough for him and his friend to float their kayak			2
for navigation they used a map drawn up by @entity75 during @entity77 times			0
highlights along the way included @entity80 , the summer capital of the @entity82 which boasts stunning water features and is renowned for a historic hydraulic system that uses the river water and is protected by the @entity86			0
mr @entity9 kayaking with friend in calm waters before braving the perilous rapids and losing a paddle at one particularly dicey moment mr @entity9 's kayak capsized in deep rapids , causing his paddle to be instantly sucked under the water by a vigorous whirlpool			2
' it probably scared me more than anything else i saw on my trip , ' said the adventurer			0
despite managing to find a replacement paddle in a nearby town , the pair soon decided it was foolhardy to continue			0
' eventually we decided we were dicing with death a little bit too much with the kayak , ' @entity9 added , ' i think i am more of a low - adrenaline adventurer			1
' calm after the storm : cycling at sunset having been loaned bikes and equipment by a generous local a friendly @entity115 villager meets mr @entity9 in the snow during part of his 450 mile trek bicycles seemed the obvious solution to continue , but the pair were short of funds owing to @entity4 being unrecognised by the international cash machine network			1
fortunately a local shop - owner had hundreds of cycles and loaned them two of his best touring bikes with panniers and sleeping bags , based purely on the premise they send him pictures of their adventure			1
mr @entity9 and his friend finished their trip at the @entity12 , near the city of @entity139 and @entity140 , where @entity142 forces were based during the @entity144 conflict			0
a @entity146 family are warm and welcoming towards mr @entity9 as he passes through their village			0
