new cans allow the top to be peeled off like a soup tin @entity3 is the first company in @entity5 to use the new lid can was originally developed for @entity7 in @entity8 in 2010 by @entity9 published : 14:53 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 02:27 est , 22 april 2013 360 degrees of consumption : the entire lid of the can is removable , ' enhancing the drinking experience ' whether or not you believe in the old adage ' if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' , one company is trying to change the way we consume beverages on - the - go			1
the @entity3 has come up with the novel idea of a 360 degree lid			1
drinkers peel off the top of the can and enjoy the contents as if drinking from a regular cup			2
the technology has been developed by @entity29 the company say the entire lid of the can is removable and ' essentially eliminates the need for separate glassware			1
' instead of cracking open a small hole on the top of the can , the 360 lid allows the top to be completely removed , creating an aluminum beer cup			1
it functions like that of a soup can , with a peel - back lid , exposing a 1.75 - inch opening			2
@entity3 will become the first brewery in @entity5 to utilize the innovative 360 lid			1
' this technology allows the full flavor and aroma of the beer to hit the drinker 's senses and makes the can an even more appealing package for outdoor activities and situations where you want to be able to move around and sip your beer easily , ' said @entity3 head brewer @entity57			2
' craft brew enthusiasts want to enjoy their beer as it was meant to be experienced whether at home or at an event and the 360 lid makes the beverage can the perfect vessel to do just that			0
' cup in hand : forget about glasses - the 360 lid allows drinks cans to be turned into an aluminum cup @entity3 is rolling it out on its @entity71 before moving on to other cans			1
right now , @entity3 is only available in @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
the cans also have another environmental payoff in that the can could be used over and over			0
the metal too is 100 % recyclable			0
the lid seems to have had a fairly positive reaction online although some are concerned that the circular design might simple lead to unfortunate instances of people cutting their fingers or lips on the thin metallic edge			0
the designers say the top of the can has been specially designed to be sipped out of and has a blunted edge			0
others have also pointed out that lid can be thrown out to create litter just like the old pull tabs of the 1970s and of course the drink is more likely to spill when walking or driving			0
different : you can almost understand why someone was more interested in taking a picture of a can rather than the on - the - field action exclusive design : the 360 degree can for @entity108 will be offered exclusively at @entity109 , this spring and summer , the baseball stadium that 's the home of the @entity110			0
