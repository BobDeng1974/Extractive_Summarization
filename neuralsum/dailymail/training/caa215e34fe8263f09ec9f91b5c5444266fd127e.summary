by @entity0 it used to be the heart of any family home			2
but kitchens are shrinking as the appetite for eating out grows			2
the average @entity6 now eats out nearly four times a week , copying a trend established by @entity9 , according to the latest @entity11 survey of restaurants in the capital			1
it used to be the heart of any family home			0
but kitchens are shrinking as the appetite for eating out grows today an exclusive report , from the estate agency , @entity17 & @entity18 reveals how the eating out trend is influencing the size of people ’s kitchens , also being cut back by the crippling cost of property in the capital			0
overall , it estimates the average kitchen has shrunk by a third since the 1960s , a time when families traditionally ate at home and prepared each meal themselves from scratch			1
the report says the kitchen is ‘ shrinking dramatically in size and prominence ’ in @entity6 homes , claiming it is ‘ falling victim to the changing eating habits of modern - day @entity42			1
’ in fact , the kitchen accounts for a smaller proportion of the total living space in new - build developments and conversions in the capital than ever before			1
@entity51 , a director of @entity52 , said : ‘ @entity54 size is no longer as important to many young professional buyers			0
‘ it is often at the bottom of the pile in their property wish list			0
’ he added : ‘ aware of the changing lifestyle of our capital ’s young professionals , developers of the latest @entity6 apartment blocks are prioritising living space , bathrooms and nearly all else over kitchen size			1
’ overall , it estimates the average kitchen has shrunk by a third since the 1960s , a time when families traditionally ate at home and prepared each meal themselves from scratch it recently sold a two - bedroom flat in a development in @entity82 , south - west @entity6 , with a kitchen which is roughly half the size of an average car parking space			1
for some homeowners , it is because their property is so small that there is no room for anything other than a very compact kitchen			1
the average size of new - build one bedroom home in the @entity94 is just 46 square metres , the size of one @entity98 carriage on the @entity99 , according to the @entity100			1
a recent investigation by the institute found many families have no space to store large supermarket shops , particularly if they bought promotions , such as buy - one - get - one - free			0
one woman said : ‘ i buy lots of stuff in @entity110			0
if it is buy - one - get - one free crisps , then we just leave it in the car			0
’ others used their garage or loft , rather than their cramped kitchen			2
for others with larger homes , the kitchen is no longer a separate room , but part of a larger living space , often billed by estate agents as a ‘ family living area ’			2
the average @entity6 now eats out nearly four times a week one flat in @entity130 , also in south - west @entity6 , was recently sold for £ 895,000 with a small galley kitchen squeezed into the corner of a huge living room			1
@entity134 , chief executive of @entity52 , said : ‘ with less and less time spent preparing meals in the home , we are starting to see the kitchen completely disappear as a room in its own right			2
‘ it is being subsumed into the wider living and dining space			0
‘ looking to the future , it begs the question whether the @entity6 kitchen is about to do a disappearing act on us altogether , or whether it has already ceased to exist as a must - have space ? ’ companies now sell ‘ hideaway ’ kitchens which look like a piece of furniture , but open up to reveal all that you need for a basic kitchen			1
others are just ‘ mini ’ kitchens which take up a tiny amount of space			0
one firm , called @entity164 , sells a one - metre wide ‘ hideaway kitchen ’ with a sink , a drainage area , a fridge and freezer , some storage shelves and a microwave			2
@entity172 , managing director of @entity164 , said his company ’s ‘ mini ’ or ‘ hideaway ’ kitchens have become increasingly popular in recent years			0
mr @entity172 said : ‘ in central @entity6 , property developers are converting more and more properties into studios and one - bedroom apartments			1
‘ this is because the way that people are living now - it is more about getting their food conveniently , rather than having the time to prepare it themselves			0
’ it is not just young professional couples who find their kitchens appealing , but also parents who want to make a room in their home into a ‘ self - contained ’ space where their grown - up child or elderly parent can live and enjoy some independence			0
