by @entity0 published : 16:40 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 23 august 2013 pressure on the @entity3 to perform as many displays as possible could have been a factor in the death of a pilot , a hearing has heard			2
flight lieutenant @entity8 , 35 , died in november 2011 after his ejection seat went off while he was on the ground at @entity11 in @entity12			1
he was thrown into the air and his parachute failed to work			1
@entity12 coroner @entity15 told the pre-inquest hearing he will require witnesses to give evidence as to whether the pressure on the team affected their performance			1
tragic : @entity3 pilot flt lt @entity8 died in november 2011 after his ejection seat went off while he was on the ground at @entity11 in @entity12 ' there have been suggestions that the number of displays the team are required to perform has got to the point where it has put pressure on the team , ' he said			1
' as a consequence there has been a reduction in the amount of time they display			2
' the hearing was told that in recent years the number of hours the @entity3 are required to fly has been reduced by over ten per cent			2
mr @entity15 said that witness evidence from @entity42 @entity41 , of the @entity44 ’s @entity43 , showed the annual number of flying hours for the team had been reduced from 3,000 to 2,600			2
flight lieutenant @entity8 's parents @entity48 and @entity50 and his sister @entity47 ( right ) watch the fly - past was conducted by two @entity54 jets after his funeral at @entity56 issues with the ejection seat firing handle and the working of the parachute are also to be examined when the full inquest is held in the @entity62			1
flt lt @entity50 , who was from @entity63 , completed his first season with the @entity3 in 2011 and held the position of @entity66 in the formation team at the time of his death			1
he was the second member of the team to die tragically within three months following the loss of flt lt @entity3 whose @entity74 jet crashed during a display at an airshow in @entity77			1
examination : an inquest into the death of flight lieutenant @entity8 will hear as to whether the pressure on the team affected their performance @entity84 , representing flt lt @entity50 ’s family , said today ' the family would like the widest examination possible as to why their son and brother died			1
' that includes why the seat firing handle was in the position that it could so easily activate the ejection system as it appears to have done			2
' ' the hearing needs to examine whether other engineers and pilots had been in a similar dangerous position to the one mr @entity8 found himself and to ensure that can not happen again			1
' there are various issues including whether there are systematic problems leading to the position of the handle being as it was			0
' the inquest will also hear from flt lt @entity107 , the first woman pilot to fly with the @entity3			1
the coroner said ' she had an incident where she was training at @entity110			0
she was sitting in the back seat of a @entity74 aircraft and inadvertently one of her straps went through the ejection handle			0
when she got out she found the handle was in position and at risk of going off			0
' mr @entity15 will also look at whether the ejection seat manufacturer @entity120 communicated fully with the @entity121 in relation to any problems with the equipment			0
the pre-inquest hearing was told that parachute which should have saved his life in the event of the ejection seat firing apparently did not work because of a shackle nut being over-tightened			2
a total of 40 witnesses are due to give evidence at the inquest due to start in january			0
coroner @entity15 said ' this is going to be a very thorough inquiry			0
i am going to leave no stone unturned			0
' sombre : the funeral for flt lt @entity8 was held at @entity56 demanding : the hearing was told that in recent years the number of hours the @entity3 are required to fly has been reduced by over ten per cent			1
this is a file picture of a @entity3 show the @entity145 decided not to bring criminal charges into the death following an investigation by @entity149			0
but there is still the possibility of the @entity152 taking action if a breach of health and safety regulations is identified			0
@entity157 , representing the @entity152 , said no final decision will be made until the conclusion of the inquest			0
the inquest is due to last for three weeks .			0
