he may not have won his race - nor even come close - but he certainly won the hearts of the crowd			1
they roared @entity7 rower @entity5 across the finish line at @entity9 as he finished his heat in last place - 100 seconds behind the winner			1
the valiant performance in the men 's single sculls repechage has seen him hailed as the ' @entity15 ' of @entity16			2
but there were some who failed to be moved by the efforts of the man who only took up the sport just three months ago			1
five - time @entity24 rowing gold medalist sir @entity23 hit out at the decision by organisers to allow him to row			1
@entity5 of @entity7 has become an early hero of the @entity16 - this @entity29 ' answer to @entity15 a giant screen tracked @entity5 's performance as he tried in vain to catch the other rowers champion : redgrave with his collection of @entity24 golds he said : ' there are better scullers from different countries who are not allowed to compete because of the different countries you 've got			1
' the 35 - year - old 's performance has made him @entity29 ' answer to @entity15 , the swimmer from @entity47 who made headlines when he finished last in the 100 metres freestyle at the @entity50 in 2000			1
@entity5 is at the @entity29 courtesy of a wild card from the @entity53 , which allows each @entity55 up to five athletes to participate at a summer games			1
previously a swimmer , he was handpicked by the @entity58 , who sent him to @entity60 to try rowing			1
after finding his feet , he then went for more training at the @entity64 in @entity65 for two months			1
his achievements in the past 12 weeks have earned him the status of the landlocked @entity70 nation 's national rowing champion			1
slow start : @entity5 can be seen struggling early on in the ehat as @entity74 's @entity73 ( in green ) and @entity76 's @entity75 pull away @entity5 charges across the finish line at @entity9 , 100 seconds behind the heat winner - just three months after he took up rowing first there was @entity15 the eel — now meet @entity82 , competing in the same event as @entity85 's @entity84			1
@entity86 of @entity87 finished a minute and 18 seconds behind the rest of the competitors in her 400m freestyle heat			2
her time of 5min 40.29sec is two seconds outside her personal best			2
@entity15 ‘ the eel ’ @entity93 shot to fame at the @entity95 in sydney when he swam the 100m freestyle in 1min 52.72sec — more than twice the time of the faster competitors and even outside the 200m world record			2
it was , however , a new personal best and a national record for @entity47			2
his early success faded fast on saturday as he was quickly outclassed by the other rowers in his heat			2
but @entity5 was thrilled with his performance			0
grinning ear - to - ear as he climbed out of his boat , he told reporters : ' it went well			1
i passed the finish line , it was great			0
' ' there were so many people encouraging me			0
' ' i was happy to finish under their applause			0
really , i 'm happy for the whole country			0
' and following @entity23 's criticism @entity120 , general secretary of world governing body @entity122 , insists he was added to the program and did n't take the place of another rower			1
and he 's proud of the way the crowd took to the underdog , adding : ' we are so proud			0
it 's given us a new country , and a big boost			0
as far as rowing is concerned it 's fantastic			2
and we are really happy about the response from the spectators			0
' @entity5 , meanwhile has had the experience of a lifetime			0
on friday , instead of being tucked up in bed before his early - morning heat the next day , he was inside the @entity141 attending the opening ceremony			2
he had been advised not to but he could n't resist			0
' it was magnificent , ' he said			0
' i had never seen fireworks before in my life ! ' he certainly did n't produce any fireworks in sunday 's race			0
but it will probably go down as one of the moments of the @entity29			0
' i 'm preparing for the next competition , ' he said			0
' i 'm happy with how things have gone			0
' torchbearer : sir @entity23 passed on the @entity24 flame to seven up - and - coming athletes at the @entity158 making a splash : @entity15 ' the @entity93 of @entity47 finished his men 's 100m freestyle more than a minute slower than the world record at @entity162			1
