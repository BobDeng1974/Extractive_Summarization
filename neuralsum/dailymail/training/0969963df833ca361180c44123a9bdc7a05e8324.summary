by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 16:37 est , 14 june 2013 even now , mere mention of the place evokes fear , horror , shame and anger			2
the workhouse was the institution you ended up in when things really could n't get any worse			2
to enter one of the foreboding @entity13 buildings - where even the architecture , it seems , was designed to intimidate - was the ultimate dread			1
inmates ( and what else to call them ? ) may have been fed and clothed , but the conditions were often barbaric and the fate of those who entered ultimately tragic			2
uncovering secrets : @entity23 looks at and old black and white photograph of her relatives and a shocking number of our ancestors were among them			1
in the opening minutes of a new documentary , secrets from @entity30 , we learn that one in ten @entity32 has a family connection to these places			1
more than 500 were built in the 50 years following the @entity35 , which made it compulsory for those seeking government relief from poverty to enter the workhouse			2
but the governments of the day did n't want to promote them as havens of shelter			1
instead , they made them as terrifying as possible			1
those entering had to relinquish all personal items - even clothes - and undertake backbreaking work such as breaking stones for ten hours a day , six days a week			1
men were separated from their wives ; children from their parents			2
quite how many of us have the workhouse etched somewhere on the family tree is brought home by the range of celebrities taking part in this harrowing programme , tracing their own ancestors ' steps into these hellholes			1
actress @entity23 clearly had no idea what skeletons lay in her family closet , and when she delves into the past of her great - grandmother , @entity71 , she discovers a woman who ended up , shamed and ostracised by society , in the workhouse - not once but twice			1
endless toil : women in the refectory of @entity79 workhouse , 1895 @entity71 had married her husband @entity80 in 1880 and bore him nine children			2
her tenth child , however , was the result of an illicit affair and - as was common at the time - @entity71 was cast out of the family home and ended up in a @entity89 workhouse , where her son @entity90 , @entity23 's great - uncle , was born			1
she was , it emerges , branded a woman of ill - repute and low morals			1
pregnant adulterers like @entity71 were forced to wear special uniforms with yellow and black stripes , designed to shame			2
with mounting horror , @entity99 discovers her great - grandmother bore not one but two illegitimate children - pretty much sealing her fate as a fallen woman			1
at one point , poring over the archives , she shakes her head in disbelief			2
' this woman is extraordinary , ' she says			2
she manages a smile - delivered along with an expletive - before concluding , ' she 's a goer , is n't she ? ' later , discovering that one child dies and another is taken into care , she makes a poignant pilgrimage to an unmarked grave			1
' novelist @entity119 is similarly upset , her features becoming more and more pinched as she discovers exactly what her mother @entity121 would have gone through as a six - year - old child , brought to a workhouse by her own mother			1
@entity121 never told @entity119 she 'd been there			2
it was a secret too terrible to tell even her own family			2
the multi-millionaire novelist only made the discovery when her biographer went searching for historical records			2
' when i found out i burst into tears , ' she admits			0
' my mother had been such a sweet person			0
i could n't imagine her in a workhouse			0
it begged the question , “ why ? ” ' by the end - discovering why her mother never mentioned any of this awful past - she is weeping openly			1
then there 's actor @entity142 , whose great - grandfather ended up in the @entity145 equivalent of the workhouse , the poorhouse			1
at one point @entity142 looks as if he might punch the poor archivist charged with breaking the news of how brutally his family was treated by the authorities			1
' b * * * * * * s ! ' he declares , as the full horror of his family history is laid bare			0
his great - grandfather @entity157 was an @entity158 immigrant who set up home in @entity160 with his wife in the late 1800s			1
they had eight children ; five did n't survive their early years			0
skeletons in the closet : presenter @entity166 discovers both her great - great - great - grandfather and his son died in the workhouse @entity142 stands in front of the tenement where the family would have lived alongside 40 or 50 other people			1
so cramped were the conditions that each family had to share one bed			0
' it just leaves you ... it 's really bad , ' he says , his voice faltering			0
@entity142 's journey to discover what became of @entity157 makes for difficult viewing			0
' @entity183 ! ' he says as the pieces are put together			0
@entity157 first seeks sanctuary in a poorhouse in 1899 when his son @entity187 falls ill with bronchitis , but the stay is only a short one			0
records show he 's back in 1901 , desperately ill himself			1
he 's discharged again , but is back almost every year thereafter			0
for 14 years he boomerangs in and out of the poorhouse , at one point - despite medical records showing he 's a very ill man - being branded a ' malingerer ' , until in 1911 he 's declared insane			1
' there 's this endless spiral into the abyss , until finally he goes nuts , ' says @entity142 , incredulous			0
' it was a harsh system , horrible			0
it 's an absolute outrage what they did to these people			0
' presenter @entity166 discovers her great - great - great - grandfather , a man who went by the wonderful name of @entity207 , managed to avoid the workhouse until he was 91 years of age			1
his son @entity210 was n't so lucky , however			0
in 1879 @entity210 , then 23 , fell ill and ended up in a workhouse in @entity212			0
@entity210 did n't survive , but what happened to his body reduces @entity166 to tears			0
if a family could n't afford to pay for a burial , the authorities had the right to hold onto it for medical research			0
it would have caused the family great anguish , @entity166 learns , because of beliefs about the afterlife at the time			0
' i always thought of the @entity228 as great philanthropists , @entity230 - fearing and kind			1
yet if you were living in poverty at that time , you were penalised for it			0
' @entity207 also died in the dreaded workhouse , but somehow the family managed to scrape together the money to take his body back home for burial - a happy ending , of sorts , for @entity166 , who greets the news with tears pouring down her cheeks			1
the grim days of the workhouse may now be consigned to history , but this show underlines how recent that history is - and how close in other ways too			1
' one of my greatest fears has always been poverty , ' @entity142 admits			0
' now maybe i know why			0
you begin to realise it 's in the dna			0
' secrets from @entity30 will be on @entity257 on tuesday 25 june at 9pm .			0

celebrities in the show trace their ancestors ' lives in workhouses
@entity265 - meant to shelter the poor - were actually terrifying hellholes
