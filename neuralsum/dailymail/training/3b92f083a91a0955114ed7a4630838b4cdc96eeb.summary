published : 08:04 est , 4 june 2012 updated : 09:06 est , 4 june 2012 rare illness : @entity1 has had to be put on a tightly controlled diet meal times are predictable affairs for little @entity1 , who lives off a diet of potatoes - as any other food leaves him screaming in pain			1
the 19 - month - old 's mother has found her son can tolerate spuds and butternut squash , but meat , fruit and vegetables leave him writhing in agony			1
@entity17 suffers from eosinophilic colitis , a rare condition where too many white blood cells are produced in his intestine			1
as a result the cells designed to protect his body actually attack it			1
the youngster had a normal , natural birth and , even though he arrived into the world with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and needed resuscitating , he made a quick recovery			0
he was soon sent home to join mother @entity36 , father @entity37 and four - year - old sister @entity38 in @entity39			1
at first when he went home he seemed fine but he was unable to settle easily to sleep			0
after a few weeks he developed a cold and started choking , before going limp and blue in his mother 's arms			0
@entity48 , 41 , a writer , said : ' the day @entity17 went blue and limp in my arms was the most horrendous moment of my life , i thought he was dying			0
' i called 999 and within minutes the paramedics were at the door			0
he came round when they arrived and we took him in the ambulance to the @entity58 in @entity39			1
' @entity61 up with seeing her little boy screaming in agony whenever he was fed , @entity48 decided to film him feeding and showed it to the hospital			1
after a colonoscopy and endoscopy at @entity66 under specialist @entity67 , @entity17 was finally diagnosed with eosinophilic colitis when he was 19 months old , which is a result of stomach acid leaking back into the oesophagus			1
his mother added : ' now we are still learning about the condition and what works for @entity17 and what does n’t			0
@entity77 : @entity36 says she has tried feeding her son @entity17 about 30 different foods , but so far only potatoes and butternut squash have worked @entity82 was initially diagnosed with bronchiolitis , and despite not having the same problems as other babies on the ward he was discharged and @entity48 continued to breastfeed him			1
she said : ' once home , he continued to choke at feeds and his breathing always seemed laboured			0
it turned me into a nervous wreck			0
' he was generally a happy - go - lucky little chap until i tried to feed him and he ’d sob through his feeds			1
he seemed to be waking up all night screaming in pain			0
it seemed that his bowels were causing him trouble as well			2
' ' if he has an allergic reaction to food he scratches at his face , screams through the night , is bad - tempered during the day and suffers with severe constipation and diarrhoea			2
he can also come out in hives and it makes him quite ill. ' it ’s completely trial and error , we try foods and see what he can tolerate			2
so far he can only manage to eat two foods , butternut squash and potato			2
@entity118 : a typical meal for @entity17 consists of squash and potato cut up and cooked in different ways - but his condition means his parents can not even use oil ' i try to mix it up through the day , so he has mashed potato for breakfast , baked potatoes for lunch and i ’ve recently started cutting the potato up into chunks so it looks like chips - although we ca n’t use any oil on them			2
' we ’ve tried him on about 30 foods including meat , vegetables , fruit and rice , but he just reacts to everything , so we ’re reluctant to try him on much else			2
' he can only drink water and a hypoallergenic formula called @entity145 which provides him with all his nutrients so people are surprised at how healthy he looks			1
' it is really sad that , at a time when we should be excitedly trying our son on lots of new foods , we are so scared of the reaction he might have			2
' we ’ve tried a range of drugs			0
some of them have helped him but some have made his condition much worse as he reacts to the ingredients in the medicines in the same way as he reacts to food and can have different allergic reactions to things like colours and flavourings			1
' we have to watch him closely as he mixes with other children to ensure that he does n’t eat anything that will make him ill. it can be heartbreaking to have to keep saying " no " to him			0
' he is now on a new drug which seems to have stabilised him a little but he is still only eating potato and butternut squash			0
like all children he can be faddy , it ’s a real worry when he seems to have gone off one of his foods			0
' @entity177 , specialist from the @entity58 , @entity39 , said : ' children like @entity17 often go a long time without being recognised , as in some ways this is a relatively new set of diseases to general practice and paediatrics alike			1
compliments to the chef : @entity17 looks delighted with his plain food but his parents wish they could try giving him more varied meals ' while it will usually resolve with time it may take many years and other related problems such as eosinophilic oesophagitis - which is likened to eczema of the gullet - can ensue and last into adulthood			1
' we are fortunate that a number of parent - led groups are beginning to flag this set of problems up to the wider community , but it is our responsibility as health care teams to recognise these conditions early and act appropriately with a referral to a paediatric gastroenterology department			0
' @entity48 added : ' it has been a long , hard journey to get to where we are but we are determined to learn more about this little known condition and to raise awareness so that children are more easily diagnosed			0

other foods leave 19 - month - old @entity215 in agony
@entity39 boy can only drink water and a special *nutritional* formula
eosinophilic *collitis* sees too many white blood cells produced in the intestine , causing stomach acid to leak up into the gullet
even medicines cause painful reactions - but new drug seems to be helping
