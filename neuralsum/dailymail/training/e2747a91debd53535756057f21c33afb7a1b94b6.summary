the @entity0 have opened up their biggest lead over @entity2 since 2010 as voters become increasingly optimistic about the economy , according to a new poll			1
with four months to go until the @entity6 , the survey by @entity7 put the @entity8 on 34 per cent , six points ahead of @entity2 on 28 per cent – worse than their result under @entity12			1
a regional breakdown suggested that in @entity14 , the @entity0 lead @entity2 by 37 per cent to 29 per cent , while in @entity15 the resurgent @entity16 is on 48 per cent to @entity2 ’s 24 per cent			1
the poll also supported others suggesting that @entity20 ’s position has been slipping in recent months , putting the party down three points on last month with 16 per cent			2
meanwhile , as @entity34 put the economy at the heart of the @entity0 election campaign , 38 per cent of voters said they were either benefiting from recovery or that the recession did not make them any worse off			1
there has been an eight - point drop since september in the proportion saying there is no recovery or that they are not feeling the benefits , and a seven - point rise in the total saying they are benefiting or are no worse off			0
and in a boost to conservative hopes of a feel - good factor by the time of may ’s election , mortgage rates fell to an all - time low and the price of crude oil crashed below $ 50 a barrel , its lowest since the financial crisis – signalling more likely cuts in petrol prices and energy bills			0
@entity34 used a speech today to set out six @entity0 election themes , as @entity2 leader @entity68 took questions in @entity70 lord @entity7 said : ‘ the success of the @entity8 ’ economic message relies on people feeling that , at the end of the road to a stronger economy , there will be something in it for them			1
’ mr @entity34 yesterday said an additional £ 30billion would need be saved before 2018 so this generation does not pass on a ‘ legacy of debt ’ to its children			0
he was speaking ahead of a vote today on a new ‘ fiscal charter ’ , committing the government to eliminating the current structural deficit			0
@entity2 is expected to back the charter , while rejecting the government ’s timetable			0
@entity2 and the @entity0 may form a ‘ grand coalition ’ together after the election , a senior cabinet minister has claimed			1
@entity95 dem business secretary @entity94 said his party should prepare for being pushed out of government , as @entity34 and @entity68 could reach an extraordinary deal to share power			2
one senior @entity0 said there was ‘ not a snowball ’s chance in @entity104 ’ of such an agreement with @entity2			2
meanwhile mr @entity68 refused to rule out a @entity2 coalition with the @entity16			2
chancellor @entity106 said : ‘ @entity2 are in a chaotic position			0
' if they vote for the charter and do accept that £ 30billion consolidation is required , then they are promising a tax bombshell because they accept our spending plans			0
‘ if they vote for the charter and reject the need for £ 30billion consolidation , then they are just pretending they do n’t want to borrow or spend more when nothing has actually changed			0
' they would be offering a grand deceit			0
’ mr @entity34 , who tried his hand at fixing tiles to a roof mockup in during a visit to @entity122 roofing college in @entity123 , sought to cast the general election in may as a choice between security and chaos the prime minister said that if the @entity0 remained in power , £ 12billion in savings would come from fresh welfare cuts , £ 13billion from a further squeeze on government spending and £ 5billion from a further crackdown on tax avoidance			1
speaking at a campaign rally in @entity123 , he said the plans were ‘ difficult but do - able ’ – the equivalent of a family saving £ 1 in every £ 100 it spent			0
he rejected @entity2 ’s warnings that @entity0 plans would mean returning public services to 1930s levels – saying spending would only be taken back to the level it was under @entity148 – and challenged @entity2 to say where it would raise taxes			1
mr @entity34 also sought to counter @entity2 attacks over the @entity8 ’ failure to make the @entity155 one of their six main election themes , announcing that the health service budget would be protected from cuts and increased in real terms if he remains in @entity161			1
but @entity2 leader @entity68 said : ‘ unless we have higher wages and living standards , we wo n’t get the revenue to reduce the deficit			1
their plan will keep failing on living standards and therefore keep failing on the deficit			0
’ latest polling shows that voters name the economy , health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family , with immigration a key concern for the country the @entity7 poll showed 52 per cent of people say @entity182 is going in the wrong direction , up three points since may last year			1
the figure is highest amongst @entity20 voters ( 76 per cent ) and lowest amongst @entity0 supporters ( 13 per cent )			2
almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) say the economy is still not recovering from the recession , while just 14 per cent say the economy is recovering from the recession and they are feeling better off as a result .			0
