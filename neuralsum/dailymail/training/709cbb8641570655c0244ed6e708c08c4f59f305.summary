by @entity1 reporter @entity2 will tomorrow become the first country in almost 40 years to soft - land a probe on the moon , in a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme			1
the nation will become the third in history to launch a lunar probe when the device , named ' @entity13 ' after a @entity2 folklore character , launches at 5.30pm on sunday evening , which is 1.30am local time			1
the mission forms part of a plan in which @entity2 hopes to build a permanent lunar base in order to launch future missions to @entity22 within the next 15 years			1
history : @entity2 will become just the third country in history to soft land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon when ' @entity13 ' launches next @entity31 gold - coloured model has six wheels and wing - like solar panels @entity2 scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch			1
the six - wheeled @entity13 vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years the probe , which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour , is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as @entity45 , which means the @entity45 , on about december 14			1
' apart from launching astronauts into space , this is probably the most complex space mission attempted by @entity2 , ' @entity47 space analyst @entity46 told @entity51			2
@entity13 is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 @entity53 days – three @entity54 days – covering an area of about five square kilometres			1
it will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high - resolution images of the rock , a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago			0
the journey of the @entity66 probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , which is cooperating closely with @entity2			0
@entity68 ’s own launch station in @entity70 , @entity71 , will immediately start receiving signals from the mission after take - off and it will upload commands to the probe on behalf of the @entity2 control centre			2
' @entity78 for human or robotic missions , international cooperation like this is necessary for the future exploration of planets , moons and asteroids , benefitting everyone , ' said @entity86 , director of @entity68 ’s human spaceflight operations			0
form : the first time @entity2 launched an unmanned spacecraft was in 1999 , pictured			2
it is the only the third country to have done so , after @entity91 and the @entity92 @entity94 astronaut @entity93 , right , walking on the moon , left , in 1969 in recent years , @entity2 has made considerable progress in its space programme			1
in june , three @entity2 astronauts spent 15 days in orbit and docked their craft with an experimental space laboratory			1
in 2007 , the country despatched an unmanned spacecraft called @entity104 to orbit the @entity54			0
the craft stayed in space for 16 months before being intentionally crashed on to the @entity54 's surface			0
the name @entity13 was chosen after an online poll in which millions took part			0
@entity112 , head of the moon rover project , told @entity114 earlier this week that the ancient beliefs had their origins in the marks left by impacts on the lunar landscape			0
' there are several black spots on the moon 's surface			0
our ancient people imagined they were a moon palace , osmanthus trees , and a jade rabbit , ' he said			0
@entity2 sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , becoming the third country after @entity91 and the @entity92 to achieve manned space travel independently			1
the military - backed space programme is a source of national pride			0
@entity2 is one of only three countries to have managed to independently send humans into space , the others being @entity91 and the @entity92 .			2

country will tomorrow launch the first unmanned lunar probe since 1976
the device will blast off at 5.30pm tomorrow , which is 1.30am local time
it has been *nicknamed* @entity13 in *honour* of @entity2 folklore character
the probe can roam the lunar surface for up to 90 days
@entity2 says it wants to *create* a permanent lunar base within 15 years
ambition is part of plan to move ahead of the @entity92 and become leading space explorer in the world
