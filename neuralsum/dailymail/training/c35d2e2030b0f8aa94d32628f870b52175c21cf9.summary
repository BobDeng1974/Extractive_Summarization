what does it feel like to have the universe at your fingertips ? the blind and visually impaired will soon be able to find out through a project that has developed @entity6 printed tactile pictures of the cosmos			1
astronomers from the @entity10 in @entity11 are using images taken by the @entity14 telescope and translating them into something that can be felt on plastic			0
visually it ’s stunning , and recreating that experience through touch is a major challenge as researchers ca n't really see space objects in three dimensions			0
‘ the work is scientific , but it 's also guesswork and artistry to try to produce an object , which printed , will look like the image that @entity14 has taken , ’ said astronomer @entity41			0
this incredible iconic image of the star cluster @entity27 shows several new stars circling around a striking bubble of gas and dust			2
it is the first to be translated into plastic using 3d printing so far , the scientists have developed 3d tactile prototype representations in plastic showing the stars , filaments , gas , and dust seen in the visual image using textures such as raised open circles , lines , and dots astronomers in @entity11 have so far developed @entity65 of filaments , gas , and dust seen in the star cluster @entity69			1
using a 3d printer , they represented each feature using different textures on a plastic sheet including raised open circles , lines , and dots			1
these features also have different heights to correspond with their brightness			2
the tallest , and therefore brightest , features are a tight group of open circles , which represent the stars in the core of the cluster			1
the team is now designing a way of rendering the nebula 's structure onto a sphere that represents its true 3d shape			1
‘ we are basically designing the process from scratch			0
’ so far , the scientists have developed 3d tactile prototype representations of the stars , filaments , gas , and dust seen in @entity69 using various textures such as raised open circles , lines , and dots			1
these features also have different heights to correspond with their brightness			2
the tallest , and therefore brightest , features are a tight group of open circles , which represent the stars in the core of the cluster			1
the 3d printouts of @entity69 are a first steps towards the team ’s goal of creating a 3d model of the cluster that people will be able to hold in their hands and study			2
‘ imagine making a visualisation that you visually fly through , and as you fly through , first you encounter filaments , and then you see some dust and also some stars , ’ said researcher @entity118			0
the team is designing a way of rendering the nebula 's structure onto a sphere that represents its 3d shape ‘ as you fly to the back side of the cavity , you see other features			1
i want to represent that in @entity6 and have people feel it with their fingers because they ca n't see it			0
‘ they would be able to spatially understand where important features are relative to everything else and what the structure is			0
’ so far , the group has tested the prototype images with about 100 people with visual impairments			0
they discovered through testing that the textures that were distinctive on the swell - form paper were not always as clearly perceived on the @entity6 plastic prints			0
the features have different heights to correspond with their brightness			2
the tallest , and therefore brightest , features are a tight group of open circles , which represent the stars in the core of the cluster ‘ sure , we can not see the image , so we do n't know exactly what it looks like , ’ said @entity164 of @entity165 who has a visual impairment			1
‘ it can never replace pictures , but with this @entity169 you can get an idea of what it 's supposed to look like and then use your imagination for the rest , ’ she added			0
the team is now designing a way of rendering the nebula 's structure onto a sphere that represents its true three - dimensional shape .			1
