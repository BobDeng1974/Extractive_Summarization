by @entity0 the @entity1 of obstetricians and @entity3 says that ' full term ' should be considered to be between 39 weeks and 40 weeks six days babies should be considered premature even if they are born after 38 weeks , experts claimed yesterday			1
up to now , babies were defined as ‘ full term ’ if they were born anytime from 37 to 42 weeks in the womb			1
they were only regarded as premature if they were born before the 37 - week mark			0
but @entity14 doctors believe the ideal pregnancy is two weeks longer			0
research shows babies born at 37 weeks are more at risk of complications , such as breathing problems , than those born at 39 weeks			1
new guidelines released by the @entity1 of obstetricians and @entity3 yesterday redefine the timeline for a healthy pregnancy			1
they say a full - term pregnancy is between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days			1
an ‘ early term ’ or premature baby would be born between 37 weeks and 38 weeks and six days			1
a late term pregnancy reaches the 41st week and by 42 weeks the baby is ‘ post term ’ or in other words , long overdue			1
‘ weeks matter , ’ said dr @entity32 of @entity33 , who chaired the committee that came up with the more specific labels			2
‘ since babies ’ outcomes can differ , let ’s not call it all the same , ’ he added			0
in recent years , doctors ’ groups have stressed that elective deliveries – inductions and c - sections scheduled without a medical reason – should n’t happen before the 39th week of the pregnancy			1
dr @entity32 said the new definitions would help doctors communicate that message			0
the @entity50 , a @entity14 group that works to improve the health of mothers and babies , welcomed the change yesterday			0
on average , a pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks , counting from the first day of the mother 's last period			2
prior to the new guidelines being released , a baby was considered to be premature if it was born before 37 weeks , and late if it was born after the 42nd week a spokesman said it ‘ eliminates confusion about how long an uncomplicated , healthy pregnancy should last			1
’ according to a joint study published last year by @entity67 and the @entity68 , children born at 37 or 38 weeks did worse in academic tests than those born just a week or two later			2
the additional time in the womb results in more brain development and , in later life , better scores in mathematics and reading tests			0
the 2012 study compared birth records and test scores for 128,000 eight year olds born in @entity81 in the late 1980s and early 1990s			0
all were born between the normal 37 and 41 weeks of gestation			0
compared with those born at 41 weeks , children born at 37 weeks faced a 33 per cent increased chance of having severe reading difficulties and a 19 per cent greater chance of having moderate problems in maths			2
those born at 38 weeks fared only slightly better than those born at 37 weeks			0
another @entity92 study found premature babies are twice as likely to suffer from severe mental conditions such as depression than those born on schedule .			0

@entity1 of obstetricians and @entity3 says ‘ full term ’ should be considered to be between 39 weeks and 40 weeks six days
it says these guidelines would *prevent* early elective deliveries which can lead to health complications , such as breathing difficulties
currently , a baby is considered to be ' full term ' if it is born between weeks 37 and 42 of pregnancy
but there are no plans to change the guidelines in the @entity92
