by @entity0 no student wants to look shaggy - haired and dog - tired in their yearbook photo			2
but @entity5 has a good excuse - he 's a half - labrador , half - golden retriever service dog			1
the faithful companion was rewarded for his loyalty by a middle school in @entity12 , @entity13 , after looking after an epileptic seventh - grader for four years			1
but for epilepsy sufferer @entity18 , the decision by the @entity38 proved @entity17 had entered everyone 's hearts			1
it was a long road for the pet - a ' dropout ' who did not make the guide dog program because he was too fond of attacking cats			2
her mother @entity48 told @entity50 had epileptic seizures from birth and her life was turned around after meeting taxi four years ago			2
he now accompanies her everywhere , including at award presentations and birthday parties			0
' we were very overwhelmed because at that time @entity18 was terrified of animals , ' she said			1
saviour : on one school sports day @entity17 became anxious immediately before @entity18 had a seizure ' next thing you know @entity18 bent down and just hugged him , and it 's the cutest thing you 've ever seen			1
' on one school sports day , @entity17 became agitated and rushed towards the schoolgirl minutes before she had a seizure			1
' he started pulling away from the aide as far as he could trying to get to @entity50 , ' she said			0
' we do n't know how he knew this , but he would n't let anyone near @entity50 until the paramedics got there			0
' taxi , however , does not take the prize for the most bizarre yearbook photo incident of 2014			2
last week a high school in @entity81 secretly photoshopped more clothes onto several of its students because it deemed them too sexy			0
the shocked girls only discovered after the yearbook was printed that many of them appeared to be wearing a different outfit			0
@entity90 superintendent @entity89 defended the decision - claiming students know the dress code and there was a sign warning them their pictures may be altered			0
under fire : @entity98 in @entity81 digitally manipulated more clothes into photos of its students			0

half - labrador , half - golden retriever was rewarded in @entity12 , @entity13
@entity38 gave him his own slot in the book
it was a prize for looking after seventh - grader @entity18 for four years
on one sports day he grew agitated and *protective* minutes before seizure
