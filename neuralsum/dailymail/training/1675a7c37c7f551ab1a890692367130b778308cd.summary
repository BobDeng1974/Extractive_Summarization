by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 20:40 est , 12 february 2013 integrity : @entity2 has announced plans to force senior officers to disclose their pay and perks police who behave like thugs will be put on a national ‘ struck off ’ register to stop them sneaking back to work at a new force			1
in a dramatic shake - up of police rules , @entity2 yesterday also announced plans to force senior officers to disclose their pay and perks			1
there will be a new register of second jobs held by all officers so that the public knows if a constable is moonlighting			1
officers have been known to work in jobs such as undertaker , vicar and pole - dancing teacher			1
and police will be stopped from effectively investigating themselves over allegations of serious misconduct			2
in future , all complaints will be referred to a beefed - up version of the @entity35			1
the home secretary said the aim of the measures was to restore ‘ integrity ’ in the police			1
it follows scandals over the @entity44 protests , the police handling of the @entity47 ‘ @entity53 ’ row and the cover - up of their role in the @entity52 disaster			1
mrs may said : ‘ we need clearer rules for how officers should conduct themselves			2
’ she pledged that , in future , disciplinary hearings against officers who resign or retire will be pursued until their conclusion			2
currently , officers can escape a guilty verdict by standing down , which brings an automatic halt to proceedings			2
anyone found guilty will be placed on a struck - off list managed by the new @entity68 and available to all forces at home and abroad			1
to the irritation of some @entity73 , guilty officers will not be stripped of their pension			0
but mrs may said they would lose out financially because they would be unable to find another police job , either in @entity77 or elsewhere			0
struck off : a new register of second jobs held by all officers so that the public knows if a constable is moonlighting it is intended to prevent a repeat of the shocking case of pc @entity86 , a riot squad officer denounced as a ‘ thug in uniform ’			1

but he was able to continue working in the police by playing the system			0
he retired from the @entity103 on medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing , re-joined the same force on its civilian staff three days later , then moved on to @entity109 before returning to serve with the @entity103 in 2004			0
an inquest found mr @entity90 had been unlawfully killed			0
but a jury found @entity92 – who has since been sacked by the @entity103 – not guilty of manslaughter			0
the jury was not told of his disciplinary record			0
the register of police pay and hospitality will be published online and regularly updated			1
officers ’ second jobs , which they have already had to disclose to their force , will now be published online			2
a stronger system of vetting before senior officers are appointed will also be developed			0
