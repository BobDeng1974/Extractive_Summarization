by @entity0 published : 02:52 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 5 may 2013 from @entity6 's iconic pearl choker to her daughter @entity7 's enormous lace ruffs , fashion in the @entity3 and @entity4 periods was just as creative , outrageous and fascinating as it is today			1
most glamorous of all were the denizens of the royal court , whose sumptuous garments are the subject of a new exhibition at @entity15			1
in @entity16 : the art of @entity3 and @entity18 includes some of the most famous artworks from the @entity20 , as well as some examples rare surviving garments from the period			1
fashion fit for a king : this portrait of @entity27 , painted during his marriage to @entity6 , has been attributed to @entity29 lovely in lace : @entity32 , left , the wife of @entity34 , and @entity35 , right , second wife of @entity36 beginning with the early 16th century , the exhibition traces the changing tastes of the royal courts and the spread of fashion through @entity42			2
although fashion was n't wholly confined to the upper echelons of society , it was increasingly important for the aristocracy whose duties included reflecting the glory of the monarchy through splendid attire			0
as a result , competition for the best designs was fierce , and led to an insatiable search for novel and outlandish creations			0
tragic wife : @entity59 of @entity60 was the consort of @entity62 , who was executed in 1649 but courtiers did n't get their own way on every sartorial matter			0
both @entity27 and @entity7 enforced laws dictating the fabrics , colours and types of garments that could be worn at each level of society			1
the most luxurious - including gold cloth , textiles dyed crimson red and certain types of fur such as ermine - were reserved exclusively for use by the monarch and his or her highest - ranking courtiers			2
@entity84 velvet , the most expensive of all fabrics , was reserved for the monarch alone			1
whatever the fabric , @entity3 clothes were all made by hand , and as a result far more expensive than their modern equivalents			2
monarch : the second @entity4 to reign , @entity62 , and the last of the @entity3 dynasty , @entity7 handmade lace , clothes that utilised real silver and gold , and linen that took several months to produce were all regularly used			1
perhaps the luxury of @entity3 and @entity4 clothes is n't so surprising when you consider that the taste - makers of the day were the @entity102 themselves			1
@entity27 's first wife , @entity104 , is credited with popularising both @entity106 blackwork embroidery and the farthingale , a hooped underskirt			0
his second , the glamorous @entity6 , made daring @entity60 hoods , long , pointed sleeves and neat chokers fashionable , while her successor @entity113 championed the heavy - and modest - gable hood			0
@entity6 's daughter @entity7 supported the trend for long - fingered gloves , which elongated the wearer 's hands and showed they did not do manual labour			0
men also left their mark			0
in 1666 , @entity123 invented the precursor of the three piece suit , which included a long vest worn under a coat instead of the traditional doublet and coat			0
the fashion spread quickly , and diarist @entity131 was among the dandies to adopt it			0
rare pieces : few jewels and even fewer garments dating from the @entity3 and @entity4 period survive although few of the period garments themselves have survived , paintings in which they take pride of place have done			1
among those on show are several of @entity7 , including a @entity146 miniature and the famous @entity148 portrait of the future queen as a teenager			2
other highlights include @entity153 's portrait of @entity32 , wife to @entity154 , and a sir @entity156 triptych of the doomed @entity62 i. in @entity16 : the art of @entity3 and @entity18 runs from the 10 may until 6 october at the @entity159 in @entity15			1
