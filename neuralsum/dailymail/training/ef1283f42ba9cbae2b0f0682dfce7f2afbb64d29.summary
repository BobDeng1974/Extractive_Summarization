' i only have one criticism , which is a strange one for the manager to make - they are too honest , too straight			0
you ca n't win @entity23 games if you are too disciplined , ' he said			2
you have to have a few maverick players , the player i brought on in the second half ( @entity36 ) ... that 's what the team needs			0
' there 's a fantastic set of professionals here , i have n't had one fine this week and i 'm finding that very unusual as a @entity7 manager - because we used to fine players every 42minutes ! ' i 'm not being disrespectful to @entity7 players , it 's just different set up			1
i just want to free this team up a little bit and if we do that we could play like we did in the last 20 minutes			0

@entity2 told @entity74 : ' it feels really great for everybody			2
' this team has got the shackles on and the exuberance they had at the back end of last year , i knew it was n't something we were going to get out of them unless we got a goal			0
' we started poorly but that was n't the approach			0
that 's sometimes how the mindset is			0
so at half - time i managed to get into them and it kind of kicked in a little bit , ironically when @entity11 scored			2
it might sound a bit strange but it was probably the best thing that happened to us			0
' @entity5 midfielder @entity70 screams with delight after scoring the winner @entity97 ( right ) brings down @entity98 to concede a penalty that ' changed the game ' meanwhile , @entity11 manager insisted the decision to award @entity5 a penalty after @entity97 brought down @entity98 in the box changed the game with his side were unable to respond			1
