president @entity0 is calling tens of thousands of illegal - immigrant children languishing in temporary @entity3 holding pens an ' urgent humanitarian situation , ' but @entity5 are pointing the finger of blame squarely at the @entity8			1
@entity0 instituted an immigration policy that the @entity10 says enticed tens of thousands of @entity12 children to cross @entity12 's southern border illegally without any parents to guide them			1
more than 33,000 have been picked up in @entity15 alone since october			1
the @entity3 border patrol says its forces are overwhelmed , and the courts are bracing for a flood of immigration cases from children held in temporary detention facilities designed to handle a fraction of the numbers			1

@entity0 rolled out a controversial @entity28 ( @entity28 ) program in 2012 , allowing many illegal immigrants who came to the @entity3 as minors to escape deportation for two years			1
the @entity8 gave them another two - year window last week			0
as a result , say some @entity10 leaders , @entity12 's system for handling illegal immigration has been strained to the breaking point and is attracting hundreds of new illegal - immigrant children every day			2
compared to the year before @entity0 's policy took effect , twelve times as many kids are coming north illegally this year			1
overflowing : the shelter at @entity44 in @entity15 can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids , forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to @entity51 for processing hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from @entity12 and @entity55 being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger @entity61 has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone a half - century - old section of a @entity3 air force base in @entity15 is now a holding and processing center for thousands of children who managed to enter the @entity3 alone			1
the same is true of a @entity72 base in @entity73			1
and a makeshift detention center in @entity75 holding 700 illegal immigrant children has ordered 2,000 mattresses to keep up with an expected influx in the coming months			1
in a landmark court ruling in december , a federal judge ruled against the @entity81 for releasing a @entity83 girl to her mother			1
the mom had hired a smuggler to transport her daughter into the @entity3 , and was herself in the country illegally			2
@entity3 district judge @entity89 wrote that ' this court is quite concerned with the apparent policy of the @entity81 of completing the criminal mission of those who are violating the border security of the @entity3			1
' ' the @entity81 , ' @entity89 added , ' should enforce the laws of the @entity3 – not break them			0
' many of the children there were sleeping on plastic boards			0

hundreds of children had not bathed in days , and were taking turns using just four showers			0
@entity106 , @entity107 ’ honorary consul in @entity108 , told the @entity102 that there were 236 @entity107 children there on saturday , including an 8 - year - old			2
republicans on @entity113 are beyond angry			0
leaked photos from the base , which were obtained by the @entity117 news blog , show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms , many of them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows			0
' the recent surge of children and teenagers from @entity12 showing up at our southern border is an administration - made disaster , ' @entity10 rep. @entity132 , who chairs the @entity133 , told @entity134 last week			1
should @entity0 's two - year ' amnesty ' for illegal immigrant minors crossing the border be abolished ? should @entity0 's two - year ' amnesty ' for illegal immigrant minors crossing the border be abolished ? now share your opinion ' @entity141 has gotten out around the world about president @entity0 's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the @entity3 illegally , ' @entity132 said in a statement			1
' enforcement at the border and in the interior of the @entity3 , ' not ' another bureaucratic task force ' is needed , he claimed			2
@entity75 rep. @entity151 , who sits on the @entity152 , said friday that ' instead of having an application of the immigration law , we are taking mothers and children and dumping them ... and violating the rule [ s ] over and over			1
' policy shift : president @entity0 announced on june 15 , 2012 that the @entity3 would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who satisfied a broad set of criteria ; the move has enticed tens of thousands of children to sneak across the border even though the policy does n't apply to them immediately contentious : @entity167 ( c ) , the @entity168 for the @entity169 , peppered @entity0 with unexpected questions during the announcement , during which the president had n't planned to take questions at all at the base , children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day			1
they can call home twice a week			0
they have access to mental health clinicians and on - site medical care the minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in @entity55 and other parts of @entity12 such as @entity107 , @entity83 and @entity190 the @entity0 administration expects as many as 80,000 of these ' unaccompanied minors ' to cross the border in 2014 , according to the @entity194			1
that number is twelve times what it was in 2011 , the year before @entity0 announced his deferred - action plan			2
the administration now estimates the holding facilities where the youngsters are being held cost taxpayers $ 252 per child per day , far more than the cost of a hotel and more than the children could expect to earn in two weeks of hard work picking crops , work that many were slated to do			2
facing the question of whether to deport the minors or play a game of catch - and - release , the administration has set aside $ 2 million to pay for their lawyers			1
' we 're taking a historic step to strengthen our justice system and protect the rights of the most vulnerable members of society , ' attorney general @entity213 said friday in a statement			0
' how we treat those in need , particularly young people who must appear in immigration proceedings – many of whom are fleeing violence , persecution , abuse or trafficking – goes to the core of who we are as a nation			0
' @entity0 's ' deferred action ' program for minors , which he announced in a fanfare - laden june 15 , 2012 @entity238 press conference , applies only to children who came to @entity12 before mid- 2007			1
' it makes no sense to expel talented young people , who , for all intents and purposes , are @entity3 , ' the president said then			2
@entity12 has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease about 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor @entity5 blame president @entity0 for the situation , pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the @entity3 photos leaked thursday from a @entity3 @entity265 facility in the @entity267 show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants , many of whom are children over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the @entity55 border illegally this year but @entity113 is rife with fears that the message was garbled by the time it reach @entity190 , @entity107 and other countries where poverty runs rampant			1
many children traveling north on their own hope the policy will include them			0
that 's what ' coyotes , ' the smugglers who bring them in , are telling them to expect , according to @entity288 , a representative with @entity290 del @entity289 , told @entity291			0

the @entity102 reported monday that in a may 30 memo to the @entity312 's transborder security directorate , @entity309 deputy chief @entity309 warned that the influx of unexpected illegals has stretched the border patrol beyond reason			0
but releasing them or reuniting them with family members in the @entity3 would serve as ' incentives to additional individuals to follow the same path			0
' president @entity0 said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from @entity107 , @entity83 and @entity190 was an ' urgent humanitarian situation ' more than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the @entity267 of @entity15 since october last year , it has been reported republicans angered about the situation point to a federal judge who castigated the @entity0 administration for relaxing its immigration policy and encouraging human traffickers			1
