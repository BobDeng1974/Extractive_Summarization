a woman set out to prove that females get catcalled no matter what they 're wearing created a blog on which women could post the outfits , some mundane , that solicited unwanted attention			1
the page titled , ' but what was she wearing : stop the @entity9 ' created by @entity11 documents what girls were actually wearing when harassed on the street - and it may surprise you			1
the page seeks to move the blame away from the girl who is often asked ' but what were you wearing ' after expressing discomfort after receiving comments from lecherous men			1
@entity52 spoke with @entity53 that the blog ’s aim is to share women ’s stories of street harassment without allowing anyone to put the blame on what she wore			1
' so often , when women try to talk about the harassment we face , we ’re met with that stupid question , ‘ what were you wearing ? ’ as if we are the ones responsible for what happened to us , ' said @entity53			1
' by having the selfies of what we were wearing upfront , it takes the question away , forcing people to get past it and just read the stories			2
' @entity53 told @entity52 that her own personal experiences motivated her to create the page			0
' a couple days before i launched , i got catcalled twice in one weekend – the first time , wearing a shorts and a baggy flannel , walking with my boyfriend , some dude yelled out his car to my boyfriend , ‘ hey , i want to f * * * k your girlfriend ! ’ that one was really upsetting because i was n’t even the object of harassment anymore ; i was just an object for men to compete over			0
' homophobic remark : @entity94 says a man on the street told her he hoped she was n't a lesbian because that would be too bad for men who fancy her covered for a reason : @entity102 said men on the street told her her sweater was too long and that they wanted to see what was hiding under it prairie girls get catcalled too : @entity109 who was dressed in a uniform she wears at a theme park got harrased by a 40 - year - old man who gave her an unwanted hand massage her story has motivated other girls to come forward with their own and form a sisterhood of women who are saying no to the catcall			1
a similar story to this one is the video of 24 - year - old aspiring actress who was filmed being catcalled 108 times as she strolled around @entity126 - even though she was wearing a plain t - shirt , jeans and sneakers			0
@entity130 , a graduate of @entity131 in @entity132 , was captured on a hidden camera by her friend , @entity134 , as she walked through the city 's streets			0
over a ten - hour period , she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments , including : ' what 's up beautiful ? ' , ' hey baby ' , ' smile ' and ' have a nice evening darling '			0
@entity130 along with many other women feel as though their boundaries are being disrespected and no matter what they 're wearing feel as though they do n't deserve it			2
@entity53 said that she was interested in the ageism of street harassment pointing out that girls under the age of 18 receive ' the worst harassment just because they left school still wearing their school uniforms			2
' tourist trap : @entity157 said that when she visited @entity126 she got catcalled by a number of greasy guys not ok : @entity160 said that she was walking down the street after a concert and a man insulted her because she did n't say thank you when he catcalled her small town big words : @entity167 says that guys yell at her from car windows often in her small town in a long coat : @entity172 says she gets catcalled when she wearing clothing she deems ' unflattering '			0
