by @entity0 the harpy eagle may be the largest and most powerful raptor found in the @entity3 , but it is also one of the rarest			0
few people have seen a harpy eagle chick , but three lucky photographers managed to snap a mother with her fluffy offspring			1
the wildlife experts climbed into the rainforest canopy to observe two harpy eagles with their chick for two days and got so close that they were able to get the whole birds in frame			1
they have wingspans of up to 7ft ( 2.1metres ) and are around the same height as a five - year - old child			0
the birds live in the rainforest canopy , which means they are hard to spot			1
they have talons comparable to a grizzly bear 's and a sharp beak which they use to dismember monkeys and sloths			2
harpy eagles have large territories for hunting from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares			1
an @entity40 tribe called the @entity41 believe they are the descendants of the jaguar and harpy eagle and worship the two animals as gods			1
photographer @entity46 of @entity47 said : ‘ it ’s so rare it ’s like seeing a unicorn			2
’ ‘ when @entity53 and @entity54 [ fellow photographers at @entity52 ] sent me a message on @entity56 saying that they found a harpy eagle nest i booked the next flight to the jungle			2
’ @entity21 eagles are apex predators in the @entity62 and have huge wingspans of up to 7ft ( 2.1metres )			1
when they are perched on a branch , they are around the same height as a five - year - old child			0
the birds might look cute , but they have talons the size of grizzly bear claws and a sharp beak which they use to dismember monkeys and sloths			2
hungry : the chick has a shock of white feathers ( pictured left ) and was treated to two meals by its doting parents ( right ) , while the photographers looked on from their precarious treetop perch @entity21 eagles are top avian predators in the @entity62 and have huge wingspans of up to seven ft ( 2.1m )			1
when they are perched in a branch , they are around the same height as a five - year - old child , but this chick has not yet reached its full size despite their large size , seeing a harpy eagle is unusual as unlike other @entity98 they do n’t soar , but instead prefer to lurk in the canopy of the forest , a little like a predatory cat			1
they are also hard to spot because they have large territories covering anywhere from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares of forest			1
‘ birders spend their whole lives just to catch a glimpse of the harpy eagle , ’ mr @entity46 said			0
‘ we were incredibly lucky to be able to sit in a tree for two days right next to a family of them			0
what makes that especially rare is the fact that a pair of harpy eagles nest just once every two or even three years			2
’ comfy : the photographers immediately saw a harpy eagle chick nestled in a fortress of soft leaves and twigs ( pictured ) , measuring around 4ft thick and 5ft wide , waiting for its mother to return dinner : the birds might look cute , but they have talons the size of grizzly bear claws and a shark beak which they use to dismember monkeys and sloths ( stock image ) evidence : like many @entity98 , harpy eagles regurgitate pellets of indigestible food			1
this pellet ( stock image ) discovered in the @entity62 in @entity143 , is from a seven - month - old chick and contains the claws and fur from a two - toed sloth ‘ i 've seen jaguars , tapirs and pumas and have even been the first person to film new species , but seeing the harpy eagle feed and interact with its chick was really amazing			1
’ to get the amazing shots , the team set out in the dark at 4.30am and began to climb a tree in the rainforest , eventually setting up their kit at around 12 storeys high , on a precarious - looking platform to which they were tied			2
they immediately saw the harpy eagle chick nestled in a fortress of soft leaves , measuring around 4ft thick and 5ft wide ( 1.2metres to 1.5metres ) , waiting for its mother to return			0
‘ we were really surprised when she showed up			0
she swooped in without a sound while carrying a fully grown @entity175 porcupine in her claws , ’ mr @entity46 said			0
‘ she just sat there and watched while the baby ate it up			0
’ demanding : the mother harpy eagle brought her chick a fully grown @entity184 in her claws to eat and later , her partner delivered half a sloth for the fluffy baby with a big appetite perched : the wildlife experts ( pictured ) climbed into the rainforest canopy to observe two harpy eagles with their chick for two days and got so close that they were able to get the whole birds in frame divine : in @entity196 there is an @entity40 tribe called the @entity41 who believe that they are descendants of the jaguar and the harpy eagle ( pictured ) afterwards , the mother called her mate – a huge male – to deliver half a sloth to the nest for the second course of their dinner			1
fellow wildlife photographers and biologists mr @entity53 and mr @entity54 have spent the last decade photographing wildlife in the @entity196 rainforest and helped film the harpy eagle family			2
‘ in my country , @entity196 , there is an @entity40 tribe called the @entity41 , ’ mr @entity53 explained			1
‘ they believe that they are descendants of the jaguar and the harpy eagle			0
they worship these two animals as their gods and view them as being very important to the jungle			0
‘ after being face to face with a harpy eagle it is easy to see why they believe that			0
finding myself in the jungle with that mythological creature , was like being in front of a legendary @entity231			0
’ mr @entity54 said that they were able to photograph two jaguars , a puma and her cub , a family of otters and hundreds of macaws on their trip			0
they also saw four species of monkeys and dozens of peccaries visiting the lodge they were staying in every day			0
elusive : harpy eagles are also hard to spot because they have large territories covering anywhere from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares of forest ( pictured )			1

three photographers snapped the birds in the @entity62 , @entity143
they filmed the chick for two days high up in the rainforest canopy
@entity21 eagles are large apex predators and the chick 's parents caught a porcupine and a sloth , which the chick *gobbled* down
they are seldom seen as they are rare , have large territories and do not soar
the creatures are worshiped as gods by an @entity40 tribe
