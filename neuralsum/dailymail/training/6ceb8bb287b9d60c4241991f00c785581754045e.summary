by @entity0 residents and visitors to @entity3 will soon be able to take in the bustling city ’s sights , from the comfort of a hovering sky car			2
a 1,640ft ( 500 metre ) monorail is being built on the campus of @entity11 ( @entity11 ) next year , with a commercial network set to follow that will extend across @entity14			1
while monorails may seem like a retro creation , this futuristic version will use cutting edge technology to see two - person pods suspended from magnetic tracks , so they appear to hover			1
the future ? residents and visitors to @entity14 , @entity3 , will soon be able to take in the bustling city 's sights , from the comfort of a hovering sky car			1
an artist 's impression of the system is pictured a 1,640ft ( 500 metre ) monorail is being built on the campus of @entity11 ( @entity11 ) next year			1
if it is successful , a larger @entity31 system could be rolled out across @entity14 , @entity3			1
the new system will see two - person pods suspended from magnetic tracks so they appear to hover			1
the network of computer - controlled ‘ jet - like ’ vehicles will use @entity39 ( @entity38 ) technology to provide what the firm says is fast , safe , free and economical travel			1
the computer - controlled pods will travel at up to 43mph ( 70km/h )			1
if the technology is rolled out commercially , the pods could travel at up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h )			2
it is estimated that tickets could cost around $ 5 ( £ 2.90 ) per rider , but discounts and subscriptions are also planned			1
the company behind the grand plan – @entity53 - based @entity31 – claims its system is a clever alternative to congested roads , and that tracks could even travel through buildings as soon as 2016			2
the network of computer - controlled ‘ jet - like ’ vehicles will use @entity39 ( @entity38 ) technology to provide what the firm says is fast , safe , free and economical travel			1
‘ @entity31 intends to revolutionise public transportation and , with it , urban and suburban commuting , ’ the company , based at @entity65 's @entity64 company headquartered at the @entity66 , said			0
like other magev trains , the system uses powerful electromagnets that let carriages float over – or in this case under – a track			0
the system uses the basic principle that opposite magnetic poles attract and repel each other			0
flying high : the network of computer - controlled ' jet - like ' vehicles ( illustrated ) will use @entity39 ( @entity38 ) technology to provide what the firm says is fast , safe , free and economical travel jet - like : the transport system will use cutting edge technology to see two - person pods ( illustrated ) suspended from magnetic tracks , so they appear to hover instead of an engine , the pods will use a magnetic field created by electrified coils in the track to allow them to hover and propel them along			1
as well as looking cool , using magnetic levitation instead of wheels mean there is no physical contact between the vehicle and the ‘ guideway ’ or rail , so there is no wear and tear			2
because the vehicles are levitated a short distance away from the guideway , and both lift and thrust are produced by electromagnets , their speed can be easily controlled and the company said they could achieve reliable high speeds of up to 150 mph ( 240 km / h )			2
luxurious : unlike monorails at theme parks , the pods will be plush and private , similar to a a car ( illustrated )			0
they will also travel much faster at 43mph ( 70km/h ) - although these speeds could rise if the system is rolled out across greater distances maglev technology is already used in high - speed railways , such as @entity124 's @entity38 ( pictured ) , which has a top operational speed of 268mph ( 431km/h )			1
but the monorail is the ultimate refinement of the system @entity38 uses magnetic levitation instead of wheels			1
the idea is that because the system makes no physical contact between the vehicle and the guideway , there is nothing to wear out or fail			0
the technology promises a smooth and quiet journey that is high speed and energy efficient			0
it is already used in high - speed railways , but the monorail is the ultimate refinement of the system			2
railways like @entity124 's @entity38 use large superconducting electromagnets in a special configuration to produce intense magnetic fields over long distances			2
opening in 2004 , it was the first commercially operated high - speed magnetic levitation line in the world			0
trains have a top speed of 268mph ( 431km/h ) and connect @entity154 and the outskirts of @entity156 with the @entity157			0
this technology will ‘ provide a platform for @entity31 vehicles to travel at high speeds , with full payloads while levitating , ’ the company said			2
the electrified system could even be powered by solar or wind power			0
the aim in building the test track is to convince town planners that the technology works so that in the near future , people could order a vehicle on their smartphone to collect them from a specified station , and then take them to their chosen destination			0
unlike monorails at theme parks , the pods will be plush and private			0
they will also travel much faster , at 43mph ( 70km/h ) although these speeds could rise substantially if the system is rolled out across greater distances			0
it is estimated that construction of the first commercial system will take two years at a cost of around $ 80 million ( £ 47,000 ) and will extend to cover the whole ‘ @entity188 ’ urban and suburban area			1
individual tickets are predicted to cost around $ 5 ( £ 2.90 or 17 new @entity3 shekels ) per rider , but discounts and subscriptions are also planned			1
if the pilot and initial commercial rollout prove a success , other cites could look to the skies to provide local travel solutions too			0
there are @entity31 routes in ‘ advanced planning ’ for @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 in @entity53			0
a new architectural feature : the company behind the grand plan - @entity53 - based @entity31 - claims its system is a clever alternative to congested roads and that tracks could even travel through buildings ( illustrated ) as soon as 2016 magnetic appeal ? instead of an engine , the pods ( an illustration of the possible interior is pictured ) will use a magnetic field created by electrified coils in the track to allow them to hover and propel them along coming soon ? if the pilot and initial commercial rollout prove a success , other cites could look to the skies to provide local travel solutions too			1
there are @entity31 routes in ' advanced planning ' for @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 in @entity205 and @entity206 in @entity53			0
a mock - up of a @entity31 station is pictured			0

magnetic monorail will be built at @entity11 next year
a commercial network is then planned to cover the rest to @entity14 , @entity3
system is *fitted* with two - person pods suspended from magnetic tracks
this gives the illusion that the pods are hovering in the air
network of computer - controlled ‘ jet - like ’ vehicles will use @entity39 ( @entity38 ) technology and electromagnets
this technology is currently used to power the @entity256 *bullet* train
pods are planned to be luxurious and tickets could cost $ 5 ( £ 2.90 )
