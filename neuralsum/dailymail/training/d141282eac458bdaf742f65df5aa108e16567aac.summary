by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 21 february 2013 a @entity2 couple are to be deported from @entity3 next month – because they settled in a suburb that was 2 miles and 854.45 yards from where they were told to set up home			1
@entity10 and @entity11 today told of their despair at being sent back to @entity14 , after migrating to @entity15 , 10,400 miles away , five years ago , and each finding jobs that were of benefit to the @entity3 community			1
but under the rules of their migration visa they had to live and work in a specified area			1
strict rules : @entity10 and @entity11 are being deported from @entity3 after breaching the terms of their visas by moving to an area three miles away from the location they were allocated to live in mr and @entity32 , from @entity33 , settled in the suburb of @entity35 , south of @entity36 , which is less than three miles from @entity37 , where they were meant to live			1
there was good work for the two of them in @entity35 and they were convinced they were doing the right thing in a country that has been asking for skilled and qualified workers			1
but the @entity46 was not happy about their choice of suburb and has invoked a little - known rule that they can not work in any other place other than that initially specified until such time as their full residency visas are approved			2
‘ when we heard from the immigration that we ’d broken the condition of the visa we were shattered , ’ mrs @entity11 , who works as a disability care specialist , told @entity58 ’s @entity57 programme			1
‘ this was not done intentionally			0
’ mr @entity32 , who is working as a much - in - demand bricklayer , was devastated			2
‘ we work hard , we ’ve put in a lot of money , we ’ve set up home here , we ’ve got vehicles and this is home , ’ he said			0
strict guidelines mean immigrants ca n't live in anywhere other than the area stated on their visas demography expert dr @entity74 said he believed the visa that ‘ controlled ’ the @entity76 was created to soothe the nations ’ concerns that migrants were flocking to the capital cities while areas that needed workers were being bypassed			1
migrants , he said , were n’t going where they were really needed , so when the @entity86 were told they had to live in @entity37 it was expected they would abide by that ruling			1
mr @entity88 , who knows the couple well , said mrs @entity11 had been looking after his disabled son for three years			1
skilled workers or professionals must be nominated by a state or sponsored by an eligible relative living in a designated area to be granted a 475 skilled regional visa in @entity3			2
the visa is valid for four years and only for a designated area in @entity3 where the applicant 's skills are most needed			2
workers are allocated a specific area to work in because of concerns migrants were only flocking to big cities to work and were n't helping to fill gaps in workforce			0
after the four years is up , workers can apply for permanent residency if they wish to stay in @entity3			0
@entity3 is well - known for its tough stance on immigration			2
‘ she ’s just made a significant difference to his life , ’ he told the tv programme			0
‘ the @entity3 adage , give someone a fair go … that ’s just gone out of the water with all this			0
’ mr @entity123 , @entity124 of the @entity125 , where mr @entity32 is a social member , said a petition of 650 had been signed in favour of mr @entity32 and his wife staying in @entity3			0
but the @entity46 has been unmoved			0
‘ their particular visa applies to those working and residing in regional @entity3 and of course regional @entity3 is determined in our case by postcodes			2
’ mr and mrs @entity11 said they thought they had obeyed all the conditions of their 475 skilled regional visa and it was n’t until they applied for permanent residency in 2011 that they found out they were victims of red tape			1
desperately , they approached real estate agent @entity147 looking for place to live in the ‘ correct ’ suburb			0
‘ at that time , there was not much available and were n’t able to help and passed them onto other agents who also were n’t able to help , ’ said mr @entity147			0
the @entity76 appealed to the @entity153 but lost their case on the basis that they had breached the terms of their visas			0
the tv channel said it was hard not to have some sympathy for the @entity2 couple when it was known that other migrants are not prevented from moving into suburbs where people of similar nationalities live			1
dr @entity168 gave as examples @entity170 migrants who gather in three suburbs in @entity173 , the @entity174 who tend to move into a particular @entity177 suburb , the @entity178 in another and the @entity180 in three suburbs			0
on march 7 , said @entity32 and mrs @entity11 , they will be ordered onto a plane and sent back to @entity14			1
‘ we ’ve made an awful lot of friends here and to be sent home … i think it ’s a bit of a disgrace , ’ he said .			0

@entity10 and @entity11 migrated to @entity15 from @entity33 in 2008
