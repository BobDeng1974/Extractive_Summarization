a transgender army veteran made history as she became the first senior to have sex reassignment surgery under @entity4			1
@entity5 , 75 , of @entity6 , @entity7 waged a long and difficult battle against the government insurance program , and claimed victory when a @entity13 health and human services board ruled back in may that @entity4 could no longer deny the service , which they deemed medically necessary for transgender individuals			1
and now , @entity5 says she finally ' feels complete ' following the procedure			2
' it 's taken me all these years and detours , potholes and whatnot to finally be where i am right now			0
' @entity4 decided to ban the surgery in 1989 , saying it was ' experimental , ' and noting a ' lack of well controlled , long - term studies of the safety and effectiveness of the surgical procedures and attendant therapies			1
' back then , @entity5 was not yet eligible for the government program , but she faced her own problems when her doctors refused to approve the surgery , largely because @entity5 was still having sex with women			1
' i have a difficult time relating to somebody what it feels like to be me , ' explained @entity5			2
' one of the obvious things people will say is , " it 's a lifestyle choice			0
you 've made this choice			0
" well , it 's far deeper than that			0
it 's so a part of my basic psyche , there 's no escaping it			0
' @entity5 , who has been married three times and has five children , says she realized she was different when she just 5 - years - old , and that all of her wives have been aware of her identity			2
those women tried to change her , but it never took says @entity5			2
inspiring : ' i finally feel complete , ' said @entity5 after the operation steps forward : some believe this may make it easier for other transgender persons to get the surgery approved by their insurance providers as for her family , she says it was just her strict and very conservative father who accepted her gender identity , and that none of her siblings supported her , labeling her a ' weirdo			1
' in fact , until 2012 @entity5 , lived what is referred to in the community as the ' stealth life , ' never revealing she was transgender			1
that all changed in 2012 however , when she decided to become an activist and take on @entity4 - after 30 years trying to get approval for her surgery			1
it was a daunting task and one that had never been tried before , but in the end , @entity5 was able to claim victory not just for herself , but for all transgender persons			2
the @entity98 board said in their ruling ; ' we have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence , which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the @entity106 , outweighs the @entity106 record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental			0
thus , as we discuss below , the grounds for the ... exclusion of coverage are not reasonable			0
' now , it is expected that other private insurance companies , and possibly even @entity114 , will begin to approve this procedure for transgender individuals			1
and while it is wonderful news for @entity5 , some see it as a little bittersweet			0
' i 'm so sad it took so long , ' said @entity5 's oldest daughter @entity123 after the surgery			2
' but i 'm so happy that she 's helping others to have it			0
' standing strong : @entity5 live the ' stealth lifestyle ' until 2012 , saying she was a woman and never telling anyone she was transgender difficult time : this news comes just a week after the tragic suicide of transgender teen @entity131 ( above ) , who said her life ' was n't worth living ' because she was transgender this step forward is even more poignant following the heartbreaking death of transgender teenager @entity131 last week , who wrote in her suicide note that her life ' was n't worth living ' because she was transgender			1
@entity131 's parents refused to accept their daughters identity , forcing her into therapy to try and change her , and the young girl cited their ' cruelty ' in her note , which posted to @entity144 hours after her death			0
in the wake of the tragedy , her parents gave an interview saying they still do not accept their daughter 's identity , and then asked @entity144 to remove their daughters suicide note , in which she wrote ; ' i will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are n't treated the way i was , they 're treated like humans , with valid feelings and human rights			1
' that dying wish is already being addressed by the @entity162 , who have started a petition to ' call upon the president of the @entity167 - @entity166 , and the leadership of the @entity169 and @entity170 to immediately seek a pathway for banning the practice known as ' transgender conversion therapy			0

@entity5 of @entity6 , @entity7 , has made history by becoming the first person to have sex reassignment surgery under @entity4
@entity5 , 75 , took on the government insurance program earlier this year , and in may a @entity13 health and human services board ruled in her favor
it is now believed that other private insurance providers and @entity114 may start approving the surgery for transgender individuals
this step forward for the community comes just one week after the tragic suicide of teen @entity131 , who wrote her life ' was n't worth living ' as a transgender person
