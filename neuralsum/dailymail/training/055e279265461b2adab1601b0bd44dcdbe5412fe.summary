by @entity0 it is said that there ’s no such thing as a free lunch , but even if you manage to bag a bargain meal , it will not taste as good as a more expensive option , according to scientists			0
a new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price			0
the experts think that people tend to associate cost with quality and this changes their perception of how food tastes			1
food tastes better if it 's expensive : a new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than it was offered for a smaller price - regardless of if the ingredients are luxurious ( pictured ) people who paid $ 8 instead of $ 4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food			1
those that paid for the $ 4 ( £ 2.40 ) buffet said felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate			2
however , the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total			0
in another experiment , scientists found that people who eat in dim lighting consume 175 less calories than people who eat in brightly lit areas			0
scientists at @entity49 in @entity50 studied the eating habits of 139 people enjoying an @entity54 buffet in an upstate restaurant			1
the price of the food was set by the researchers at either $ 4 ( £ 2.40 ) or $ 8 ( £ 4.70 ) for the all - you - can - eat meal			1
customers were asked to rate how good the food tasted , the quality of the restaurant and to leave their names			0
the experiment revealed that the people who paid $ 8 ( £ 4.70 ) for the food enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the ‘ cheaper ’ buffet			1
interestingly those that paid for the $ 4 ( £ 2.40 ) buffet said they felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate			2
however , the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total , according to the study presented at the experimental biology 2014 meeting this week			0

’ he thinks that people enjoyed their food more as they associated cost with quality and that small alterations to a restaurant can change how tasty people find their meals			2
in a previous study , researchers from the university showed that people who eat in dim lighting consume 175 less calories than people who eat in brightly lit areas .			0
