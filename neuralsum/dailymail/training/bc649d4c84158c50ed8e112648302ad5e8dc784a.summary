@entity10 mp @entity9 has been kicked off the @entity12 policy board after refusing to back the prime minister 's call for action against the @entity18 regime 's use of chemical weapons			1
it is the first high profile sacking in the wake of the humiliating defeat , which the government lost by just 13 votes - but more are expected			1
fired : @entity10 mp @entity9 ( left ) has been fired from the @entity12 policy board after failing to vote for @entity2 's call for action in @entity8 in an extraordinary assault on mr @entity2 's authority , 39 coalition mps joined @entity31 in voting against a watered - down @entity33 motion supporting the ‘ principle ’ of military action			1
but a total of 31 - including mr @entity9 - did not vote at all			0
there were shouts of ‘ resign ’ from the @entity31 benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked @entity42			0
mr @entity2 today expressed ' regret ' at the @entity45 defeat as he began the process of punishing @entity47 who defied him			1
mr @entity9 has become the @entity14 's first scalp , with @entity50 making clear ' there are consequences for not voting with @entity33 '			0
however , @entity1 understands two @entity54 ministerial aides who also abstained will not be sacked by @entity55			2
@entity56 , parliamentary private secretary to treasury minister @entity58 , and @entity59 , aide to business secretary @entity60 , told @entity54 whips they could not back the government but were not given permission to abstain			2
however mr @entity55 , who argued passionately in favour of action in @entity8 , has made clear that both will continue in their jobs			0
in all 10 members of the government failed to vote at the end of thursday 's eight0hour debate			2
it included two ministers - @entity73 and @entity74 - who were chatting in a room near the @entity45 and claimed not to have heard the division bell to tell them the crunch vote was under way			2
a new @entity80 survey found 64 per cent of people were dissatisfied with the prime minister 's handling of the crisis and 61 per cent with @entity86 's response to the events			2
just 36 per cent were satisfied with mr @entity2 and 39 per cent were satisfied with mr @entity86			0
row : @entity2 today said expressed ' regret ' the way @entity31 voted against his motion on military action while @entity31 leader @entity86 accused the prime minister of a rush to war also absent from thursday 's vote were @entity10 treasury minister @entity95 , @entity54 pensions minister @entity96 and @entity54 whips @entity97 and @entity98			1
mr @entity95 , mr @entity99 and mr @entity96 were all on holiday and given permission by the whips to miss the crucial vote			0
@entity104 , the minister without portfolio , missed the vote for family reasons			2
if the missing ministers , whips and aides had all turned up , mr @entity2 would only have needed to persuade four other no - show @entity110 - including mr @entity9 - in order to win the vote			1
@entity113 : international development secretary @entity73 was chatting to foreign office minister @entity114 ( right ) in a small room near the @entity45 as mps voted on military action former @entity10 cabinet minister @entity118 , another member of the @entity50 policy board , insisted that instead of being shocked by the defeat the prime minister ‘ should have seen it coming ’			1
he added : ‘ a government defeat on an issue of war may be unprecedented , but defeat on the @entity8 vote did not come out of the blue			0
you can certainly blame poor party management , failure to prepare the ground , underestimating the poisonous legacy of @entity134 — but such failings are common enough , ’ he writes in this week ’s @entity136			0
‘ the biggest single factor is one that ministers , the media and @entity110 themselves have failed to understand : @entity138 has changed			0
’ he argues that mps are now more rebellious because they react to the opinion of their voters not the demands of the whips			0
during prime minister 's questions today @entity31 leader mr @entity86 accused mr @entity2 of seeking a ' rush to war '			1
the prime minister repeated his assurance that the @entity153 ' ca n't be part and wo n't be part ' of any strike on the @entity18 regime after his defeat in the @entity45 last week			1
but he accused the @entity159 of needlessly blocking even the principle of an armed response to the use of chemical weapons after it failed to accept his offer of a second vote to approve direct action			0
back again : it was the first session of prime minister 's questions since mr @entity2 's damaging defeat during last week 's emergency debate on @entity8 measured commons exchanges between the party leaders at question time turned acrimonious when mr @entity86 said the vote was ' not about @entity153 shirking its global responsibility , it was about preventing a rush to war '			1
but mr @entity2 hit back : ' last week the @entity42 voted clearly and i have said i respect the outcome out of that vote and i wo n't be bringing back plans for @entity153 participation in military action			1
' i agree with you that we must use everything we have in our power - our diplomatic networks , our influence with other countries , our membership of all the key bodies , the @entity194 , the @entity195 , the @entity196 , the @entity197 , @entity198 - we must use all that influence to bring to bear			0
' my only regret of last week is that i do n't think it was necessary to divide the @entity42 on a vote that would have led to a vote but he took the decision that it was			0
