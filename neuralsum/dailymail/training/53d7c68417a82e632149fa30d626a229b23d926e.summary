like most women , @entity0 experiences uncomfortable tummy pain once a month			1
she gets irritable and is quick to anger , leaving her family in no doubt it ’s time to be careful around mum again			1
yet @entity0 , 39 , does n’t have @entity7 : instead she suffers an acute pain during ovulation			1
the mysterious and agonising condition , called @entity11 by doctors , affects around one in five women and can leave sufferers incapacitated			1
the severe symptoms also have a profound effect on their relationships and working lives , with some women reporting personality changes alongside the pain			1
acute pain : @entity0 , 39 , suffers extreme pain during ovulation because of a mysterious and agonising condition , called @entity11 despite being relatively common , ovulation pain is little known			1
and , intriguingly for a medical phenomenon that blights the lives of women all over the world , the cause has not been found			0
@entity0 , who lives in @entity35 with her partner @entity36 , 44 , and children @entity38 , 11 , and @entity39 , ten , says : ‘ my family bear the brunt			1
that ’s because it ’s so painful , i have a much lower tolerance level , particularly towards my children			0
‘ i also find myself snapping at @entity36 for whatever reason and , bizarrely , i have to clean the house much more			0
i do n’t know if that ’s because i ’m less tolerant , but during a bout i ’m always picking things up and putting them away			0
‘ i know i ’m being irrational but i just ca n’t help it			0
it ’s the same every month			0
’ ovulation pain usually lasts for up to 48 hours and , although it ’s not clear why some women have it and others do n’t , experts believe it may be down to genetics			1
one theory is that during ovulation , the ovarian wall ruptures , causing bruising			1
unknown cause : one theory is that during ovulation , the ovarian wall ruptures , causing bruising @entity65 , consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at @entity67 , @entity68 , says : ‘ the name @entity11 is derived from the @entity71 word for “ middle pain ” which means pain occurring in the middle of the month			1
‘ it differs from period pain in that it usually occurs on the 14th day of the cycle , rather than during the days of bleeding			2
around 20 per cent of women — or one in five — can have ovulation pain , which can occur regularly every month or intermittently			1
‘ some experts believe the condition may be due to irritation of the abdominal lining at the time of ovulation , by blood or other fluid that is released from the ruptured egg follicle			1
‘ another theory is that after ovulation , the ovaries or fallopian tubes contract , which may cause the pain			1
’ many women suffer for years without a diagnosis , and the condition is often mistaken for appendicitis — as @entity0 discovered when she first experienced ovulation pain at the age of ten and was rushed to hospital			1
‘ two weeks earlier i ’d had my first period , and i woke up in the night with a sharp stabbing sensation in my side , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity104 took me straight to hospital , where i had a raft of tests and the doctors prepped me for surgery to remove my appendix			2
but within the hour the pain had gone so the surgery was cancelled			2
‘ they had no idea what had happened			0
i had blood tests and internal exams			0
there were all kinds of diagnoses , from stomach ulcers to bowel spasms			0
but it was n’t until months later , when i ’d been hospitalised several times , that my mother was told it could be ovulation pain			1
’ in common with other sufferers , @entity0 agrees the pain is far worse than normal menstrual cramps			1
‘ it ’s as if someone has taken the tip of a hot knife and poked it into my side , ’ she says			0
‘ the longest it ’s ever lasted is about an hour			0
incapacitated : ' it 's as if someone has taken the tip of a hot knife and poked it into my side ' ‘ it ’s usually on my right - hand side — which is probably why it was mistaken for appendicitis — but it can be on both sides			2
‘ the intensity is breathtaking			0
often i ’ll have to stop what i ’m doing and bend over , holding on to a chair or table , and i ’ll press my fingers into the pain to ease it			2
@entity0 , who works with people who have dementia , says : ‘ doctors told me it was something i would have to get used to			1
‘ they prescribe strong painkillers such as naproxen and codeine but i rarely take them because the pain only lasts for about an hour , so it ’s gone by the time they kick in			2
’ when she was younger , @entity0 used the @entity162 to quell the ache			1
it works , says @entity65 , because it prevents the ovary from releasing an egg , effectively stopping ovulation			2
‘ if you are trying to conceive and come off the contraceptive pill , the pain is likely to return , ’ she says			2
‘ ovulation pain does n’t affect fertility — in fact it can be useful if you are trying for a baby because it tells you when you are ovulating			1
’ years of suffering : @entity0 ( pictured as a child on holiday ) has suffered from ovulation pain since the age of ten however , the crippling pain can put women off making love at the time when their chance of conceiving is highest			1
when @entity0 was in her early 20s she stopped taking the @entity162 to try for a baby , and the agonising monthly pain returned			1
she quickly became pregnant but went on to suffer two miscarriages			0
@entity0 says : ‘ it ’s something that runs in my family — my mother had five miscarriages			1
i had surgery after mine , which left scar tissue in my fallopian tubes , so we began fertility treatment			0
‘ when i was on @entity201 , the drug used to stimulate ovulation during @entity204 , i did n’t get the pain , which was strange			1
i ’ve no idea why			0
' @entity207 ' is the term used when no ovulation takes place			2
causes can included drastic weight loss and polycystic ovaries ‘ but once i ’d come off it , having decided to adopt our two children rather than go through more treatment , the pain returned			2
’ @entity0 has now gone back on the @entity162 to try to end her misery			1
meanwhile , @entity220 , 41 , who lives in @entity221 with her lawyer husband @entity222 , 40 , and their three sons , has suffered from ovulation pain for several days a month since her early 20s			1
she believes it has affected her mentally as well as physically			0
‘ when i was 22 and got engaged to @entity222 , i began to get pain in my right side , ’ she says			2
‘ friends and family were saying it was down to stress about the engagement , or that it could be appendicitis			0
‘ but my father is a surgeon and he knew it could n’t be appendicitis because i did n’t have a temperature , i still had my appetite and i could sleep though the pain			2
’ looking forward to menopause : @entity0 's symptoms will cease when she stops having her period for the next few years , @entity220 went backwards and forwards to her gp as well as some of the top private gynaecologists in the country			1
but despite a multitude of tests , no one even mentioned ovulation pain			2
‘ i had endless scopes and scans and they ruled out everything , including ovarian cysts and gallstones , ’ she says			0
‘ the physical side was bad enough , but it impacted me more emotionally			0
‘ i would n’t say i was depressed but i did n’t want to socialise while i had it because i was exhausted with the pain — and friends did n’t seem to understand			0
‘ i ’d be so tired that sometimes i could n’t even walk to school to pick up my children			0
no amount of painkillers helped			0
’ the agony stopped during all of @entity220 ’s pregnancies — with @entity266 , now 13 , @entity267 , 12 , and @entity268 , four			0
she says : ‘ after i ’d had my third child , it stopped for several years and i forgot all about it			0
but then a year ago it returned			0
‘ the pains felt random but i suppose it was between days 8 - 12 of my cycle , and it would last until i had ovulated			0
‘ from what i can gather , that ’s quite extreme for ovulation pain — most women only suffer it for a few hours			1
’ then last year , @entity220 ’s father was discussing her symptoms with colleagues when someone mentioned ovulation pain			1
@entity220 looked it up online			0
‘ straight away i knew that must be what i had because the symptoms matched mine , ’ she says			0
‘ it made me feel slightly better psychologically to know there was a name for the condition i was suffering and that it was n’t anything sinister			0
’ like @entity0 , @entity220 has been advised to go back on the @entity162			2
@entity0 says : ‘ i ’m 39 now and i suppose i ’ll have to deal with this pain until i hit the menopause , which , if my mum is anything to go by , will be around 48			1
‘ i ’m not looking forward to the hot flushes — but it will at least solve the ovulation pain			2

@entity0 suffers acute pain during ovulation , which leaves her irritable and quick to anger
doctors call this mysterious and agonising condition ' @entity11 '
lasting up to 48 hours , pain can leave sufferers incapacitated
other effects include personality change and relationship *breakdown*
so far doctors are unsure what causes the symptoms
one theory is the ovarian wall ruptures during ovulation , causing bruising
