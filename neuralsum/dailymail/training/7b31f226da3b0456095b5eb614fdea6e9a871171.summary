prior to the storming run that has taken @entity1 to the semi-finals of the @entity3 she spoke of not wanting to be constantly associated with her former fiancé @entity4			1
' i do n't want to have my name stuck with him forever , ' she told the @entity9			2
' i 'm my own person , i have my own career			2
' as ever actions speak louder than words , and nothing could have shouted out that sentiment more than the form she has shown at @entity18 , where she now meets the unseeded @entity20 @entity19			1
she has given herself a great chance to make a second @entity24 final			2
@entity25 will try to join her in the last four as he took on @entity26 for the first time since the @entity29 final last year			2
the @entity35 has now tired of fielding questions about that issue , declaring it irrelevant to what has been going on for the past eleven days			1
you can allow her a bit of disingenuousness on the matter , but the facts say otherwise			2
since the @entity56 , where the hurt was at its rawest , she has collected a 24 - 5 match record , with two of those defeats coming against her close friend @entity31			1
the last time she was in the last four of a @entity64 was not long after she and @entity4 began dating			1
the demands of keeping a romance going with two global schedules cost her a top ten place and saw her fail to get past the quarter finals of any @entity24 after that			1
love game over : @entity1 split from her fiance @entity4 ( @entity74 ) in october 2013 moving on : the 24 - year - old is looking forward to not always being associated with the golfer until now , with her renewed single status having had a galvanising effect			1
it would be wrong to portray @entity1 as bitter about the break - up , in fact she has handled it with class and has avoided criticising her ex-partner			1
' when it comes out of the blue that 's like a shock , it 's like someone dies right in front of you			0
' the years we had together were great and unfortunately things had to end like they did			0
' @entity31 said she had been struck by her friend 's lack of rancour , revealing : ' she said , ' i could never hate him , he has been a big part of my life and even if i wanted to i could n't hate him			0
' in tennis - specific terms there has also been an unexpected dividend coming from the cancellation of her wedding			2
' @entity110 part of my life ' : @entity1 admits she could never ' hate ' @entity4 even if she tried sealed with a kiss : @entity1 celebrates after defeating @entity41 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 in the quarter - finals the nuptials were due to take place in november , and to fill that void she decided to enter the @entity116 instead			1
while always among the best movers and most durable of players she has become even better in that department , aided by a slight loss of weight through a form of training that is highly unusual for tennis players , whose joints are quite stressed enough already			0
@entity41 plays like a human backwall and her plan is always to get everything back , wear opponents down and make them run , but she was completely overwhelmed by the athleticism on the other side of the net			1
the concern in @entity135 back in may was that the trauma of what happened with @entity4 could shatter an already ailing career , but the opposite has proved the case			1
' i have proven people wrong so many times , ' said @entity1 after beating @entity41			1
' i was told when i was younger there is no chance i will make the top 100 , top 50 , top 30			0
every time i have proven them wrong			0
it 's kind of nice			0
' i feel confident and i feel comfortable out there			0
i have been playing well in these last few months			0
it 's just nice that it 's paying off here			0
' eastern promise : @entity1 faces doubles specialist @entity19 in the last four at @entity18 her best result in a @entity24 was reaching the final here in 2009 , before making the semis in the next two years			1
the feeling she has now is more like it was five years ago			0
' i have to say the finals in ' 09 feels closer than the semi-finals of 2011			2
i think just because it was such a huge experience for me and it was my first really deep run in a @entity24			0
i 'm just so happy to be back in this stage and having another match out there			0
' at 28 this will be a first @entity24 singles semi-final for @entity19 , a renowned doubles expert , and few would bet against @entity1 rounding off this extraordinary summer for her by making it all the way to the final			1
