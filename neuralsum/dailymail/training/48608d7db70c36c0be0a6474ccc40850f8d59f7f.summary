mysterious : @entity0 has hit the headlines this week as @entity3 's lover and @entity5 's travel companion they are the kind of quietly decent , middle - class people universally recognised as the backbone of @entity10			1
now retired , @entity11 used to be an executive with clothes retailer @entity13 , while his wife @entity14 has devoted her life to developing methods of helping children with learning difficulties to read			2
not the kind of family to be involved with the story of an international spy fleeing from justice — unless they were watching a blockbuster film			2
but all this week at their cosy farmhouse in @entity28 , they have thought of little else			0
for their beautiful , privately schooled daughter @entity0 , 31 , is the ‘ mystery ’ long - haired girl who has been shepherding former @entity32 technician @entity5 in the glare of the world ’s media as he makes a diplomatic dash to escape the wrath of the @entity38			1
@entity0 , who has been the lover of charismatic @entity39 leader @entity3 , 41 , and has become a pivotal figure in his organisation , has been holed up most of this week with whistleblower @entity5 in a hotel in the transit area of @entity45 ’s @entity44			1
@entity46 says that , since @entity5 has not passed through immigration , he has not technically entered the country			1
president @entity50 has refused him entry and declared him ‘ free to go ’ wherever he wishes , ‘ the sooner the better ’			0
his planned destination is @entity54 , to which he has applied for asylum , even though the @entity56 has revoked his passport			1
@entity54 has given asylum as well as board and lodging to the supercilious @entity3 in its @entity62 embassy , where he is under siege after more than a year as he tries to avoid being despatched to @entity65 to answer sex charges			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , has been charged with espionage by the @entity56 after his exposure in @entity69 of @entity70 , a covert security project run by @entity56 intelligence that pries into @entity74 accounts , emails and phone calls			1
he also revealed details of major electronic eavesdropping by @entity80 ’s @entity79 called @entity81 , describing it as ‘ the largest programme of suspicionless surveillance in human history ’			0
the former analyst was in @entity87 when the @entity56 laid the spying charges that could put him in jail for the rest of his life , and @entity56 immediately sought extradition			2
but the authorities there refused to send him home because of a misspelt name on the extradition application form			2
( @entity5 also claimed the @entity56 hacked into millions of @entity98 mobile phone messages , which hardly made the @entity98 state sympathetic to @entity101 ’s request			1
) enter @entity0 , who has become an expert on immigration and extradition matters through the plight of @entity3 , whose visitors at the @entity54 embassy , where he has a desk and a bed , are vetted by her			1
she is also said to do @entity3 ’s washing at her @entity62 flat , and even though @entity39 had nothing to do with the latest whistleblowing revelations , @entity3 instructed her to fly to @entity5 ’s side in @entity87 and help him in his request for asylum in @entity54			1
inner circle : @entity0 ( centre ) started working for @entity39 founder @entity3 ( left ) in 2010			1
she quickly became his right - hand woman educated : miss @entity120 went to @entity121			0
former pupils include princess @entity124 's husband , actor @entity125 and how sir @entity126 , former head of @entity128 one prominent supporter says : ‘ @entity39 ca n’t afford not to be involved in such a major leak issue			0
’ so @entity5 ’s future freedom is largely in the hands of @entity0 , whose friends describe as ‘ very committed , very determined and a good organiser who loves being at the centre of things where there is some excitement ’			1
‘ she knows what she ’s doing — she ’ll be fine , ’ one says			0
unsurprisingly , that ’s not how @entity11 and his 60 - year - old wife see it			0
they never expected to find their daughter at the eye of an international diplomatic storm			0
‘ we have n’t heard a thing from @entity0 and i ’m worried — though not nearly as worried as my wife , ’ admits mr @entity11 , 74			1
‘ all i know is what i read in the newspapers			0
@entity0 ’s always been very conscientious , diligent , and i believe she ’d like to see the world a better place			1
but heaven knows where this could end			0
’ it ’s certainly not what they had in mind when they sent @entity0 to @entity121 ( boarding fees currently £ 29,600 a year )			1
former pupils include princess @entity124 ’s husband , vice admiral sir @entity165 , the triple - oscar - winning actor @entity125 , as well as — and how juicily ironic — sir @entity126 , head of @entity128 for six years until this april			0
@entity0 was a good runner and swimmer and bright , too — ‘ a good all - rounder who enjoyed her time at the school ’ , says her father proudly			2
from there , after doing well in the international baccalaureate and taking a skiing - and - travelling gap year , she read @entity10 at @entity174 , and later , after more travel , decided she wanted to be a journalist			0
none of this can be found in standard internet searches or is included in a ‘ biography ’ of her put out by @entity39			0
like other figures in the organisation , she appears to have wiped her online profile off the net for privacy purposes — hardly what one expects from those dedicated to the exposure of information and the public ’s right to know			0
on the run : @entity0 was sent by @entity3 to assist whistleblower @entity5 on his journey to @entity54 @entity194 linked : @entity0 is known as @entity3 's ex-girlfriend but some believe this is only because of he is incarcerated in @entity198 these , after all , are the people who see themselves as the global defenders of free speech , valuing it so highly that they ignore fears that their disclosures threaten the national security of democratic nations and possibly even world peace			1
one @entity56 congressman described them as ‘ terrorists ’			0
how different is their attitude to their own secrets and security — damningly illustrated by @entity213 in an embassy instead of doing what most men protesting their innocence would surely do , flying to @entity65 to clear his name			2
@entity0 ’s deep commitment to @entity39 is seen , in part at least , as being driven by her fascination with @entity3			1
‘ all the girls are hypnotised by him to one extent or another , ’ says one senior supporter			0
it started in 2009 when , having reached the age of 27 without becoming a journalist , she successfully applied to be an unpaid intern researcher for the charity - based @entity232 , which trains and helps journalists and is based at @entity234 , @entity62			0
she was positive , bright , enthusiastic , and , in 2010 was taken on as a junior researcher by the newly established @entity236 , a professional operation also housed at the university — and whose reputation is now badly damaged since its misleading television report that led , wrongly , to @entity243 peer @entity241 being identified as a paedophile			0
@entity0 was involved in helping sort files for television documentaries on the @entity248 war passed to them by @entity3			1
he was newly arrived in @entity62 and spent days at the bureau office strutting around in jeans and a stab vest and , says one of @entity0 ’s friends , ‘ trying to get all the women salivating ’			2
later that year , @entity0 ’s affair with @entity3 began			1
she stayed with him at his room at the @entity259 in @entity260 until he was arrested and held on remand in @entity263 jail pending extradition proceedings over assault allegations involving two @entity65 women			2
when he was granted bail and went to stay in the @entity269 manor house of former guards officer and @entity39 supporter @entity271 , @entity0 went with him			2
and when he stayed at the home of another supporter , @entity274 businesswoman @entity273 , @entity0 was there , too			2
with these supporters , as well as @entity276 , film director @entity277 and others , @entity0 helped to cover @entity3 ’s bail			1
it was £ 5,000 in her case , of which she lost £ 3,500 when he went into the protective arms of the @entity54 embassy in @entity198 more than a year ago			1
silent : @entity0 's parents say they have n't heard from her since she went on the run with @entity5 @entity39 workers are known to be paid very little			1
so where did she find the money — from her father ? ‘ oh , i ca n’t say , ’ says mr @entity11 , who is charming but discreet			0
his educational consultant wife worked for @entity293 until her department was closed two years ago			0
she now runs a company offering reading programmes for children with learning difficulties			0
friends of @entity0 say she took @entity3 to meet her parents at their farmhouse before he fled into his embassy refuge , but @entity11 declines to confirm or deny it — ‘ i ca n’t comment , ’ he says			1
but he does refer to @entity3 as ‘ @entity304 ’			2
as for @entity39 , he will only say : ‘ my daughter is a great girl who has her own life these days			0
’ she and @entity5 are seemingly stuck in limbo in the airport in @entity45 , as @entity54 has now warned that it could take ‘ months ’ to process his asylum application			1
some , of course , refer to @entity0 as being @entity3 ’s ‘ ex ’ girlfriend , but others believe this is only because he is incarcerated in @entity198			1
‘ she was very enamoured of him , and he of her striking looks and positive thinking , ’ says one close figure			0
‘ she really is a terrific girl with a great sense of fun , and she ’s clever			0
it ’s hardly surprising that he ’s behind her growing power in the organisation			0
they ’re closer than ever			0
’ so , how would @entity11 and @entity324 view the idea — just the idea — of @entity3 becoming their son - in - law ? ‘ well , ’ says the former @entity13 man , ‘ strange things do happen in this world			2
