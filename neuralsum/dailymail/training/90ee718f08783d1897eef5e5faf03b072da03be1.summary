by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:04 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 04:10 est , 13 february 2013 when it comes to getting answers out of politicians , his abrasive manner certainly achieves results			2
but you might expect @entity9 to tone it down somewhat when the ones taking the questions are undergraduates on @entity14			1
the presenter has been labelled ‘ rude ’ , ‘ nasty ’ and a ‘ bully ’ by viewers who took exception to his treatment of a nervous contestant on the @entity23 quiz show – with one even commenting : ‘ why not just spit in his face , @entity9 ? ’ scroll down to watch hopeful : @entity27 was looking forward to appearing on @entity14 ( left ) but seemed shaken after @entity9 's remarks when he answered a question wrong third - year medical student @entity27 , representing @entity30 , found himself receiving the brunt of @entity9 ’s ire during a quarter - final match against a team from the @entity35 on monday			1
during one quick - fire round , the 20 - year - old from @entity37 was met with a barrage of scorn by the broadcaster , 62 , who also hosts current affairs show @entity43			1
in a question open to whoever pressed their buzzer first , he asked : “ the liberties of @entity48 and the @entity50 religion i will maintain			0
” which royal figure made that claim when he landed at @entity53 , in @entity54 , in 1688 ? ” a rival contestant buzzed before @entity9 had finished speaking and wrongly answered : ‘ @entity56 ’			1
not impressed : @entity9 gave student @entity27 a grilling when he failed to answer a question correctly ' bully ' : @entity9 raised an eyebrow and declared ' it 's only about 600 years out ' when a @entity30 student got a history question wrong but the presenter reserved his derision for mr @entity27 , who came in quickly afterwards and suggested @entity65 i instead			1
looking incredulous , @entity9 exclaimed : ‘ no ! @entity65 ? no i ’m sorry that ’s the wrong answer and you know it ’s very wrong			1
’ raising his eyebrows , he added : ‘ it ’s only out by about 600 years or so			0
anyway no , it ’s @entity65 of course , @entity73 ’ mr @entity27 seemed shaken by the presenter ’s reaction , putting his hand nervously to his face and shaking his head			1

@entity9 you meany ! ’ @entity9 faced a @entity83 tirade following the savaging of the shy student the episode prompted a storm of other online comments , and 44 complaints to the @entity23			1
but at the family home in @entity37 yesterday , the student ’s mother @entity93 , 45 , defended @entity9 and said viewers had overreacted			1
she said : ‘ i think @entity9 is always a little tough with the contestants			2
but i think it is all in good spirit			0
' it is a challenge after all			0
‘ i do n’t think he ’s a bully			0
@entity27 wanted to do well and perhaps that showed more when he got things wrong rather than right			0
' i met mr @entity9 and found him very pleasant			2
@entity27 ’s very clever and we are very proud			0
embarrassed : @entity27 kept his head down for most of the game after he experienced @entity9 's abrasive manner ' he is a shy boy so i think at times he was a little uncomfortable , but that is just his way			1
he was very excited to take part and we think he did very well			0
’ despite mr @entity27 ’s mistake , the @entity30 team eventually beat @entity35 by 190 points to 125 in the episode , watched by 2.89million			0
a @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ @entity14 is a tense and fast - paced competition , and @entity9 ’s acerbic remarks have long been part of the appeal			2
