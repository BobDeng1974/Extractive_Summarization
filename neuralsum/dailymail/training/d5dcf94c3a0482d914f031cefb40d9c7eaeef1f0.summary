it was a daring bid for freedom that could have come straight out of @entity2 or @entity3			0
but the intrepid five who attempted to tunnel under a spike - topped 12ft metal fence using nothing more than pilfered cutlery were not plucky pows fleeing the @entity10 – but @entity12 schoolboys trying to break out of their city academy			1
if any of the youngsters tasted liberty , however , it was short - lived as the culprits were soon rounded up , and the already imposing security measures tightened up even further to thwart future escape efforts			1
pupils dug a hole in an out - of - the - way spot within the grounds of @entity24 , @entity12 ( above ) their hole – dug in an out - of - the - way spot in fields within the grounds of @entity24 – has now been filled in , and a metal bar inserted to strengthen the fence , which was designed to ensure under - 16s do not leave school grounds			1
acting headteacher @entity32 said the pupils , thought to be all under 14 , have been ‘ spoken to ’ and vowed : ‘ our staff are supervising that area to ensure our students stay in school			1
’ the school takes tough measures to combat truancy			1
as well the forbidding fence , its security also includes a ‘ swipe - in ’ system			2
@entity45 , whose daughter is a year 9 pupil , said : ‘ the fencing with security signs all over it does make it look a bit more like a prison than a school and i guess to some pupils that ’s a challenge			1
' assistant head @entity55 wrote about the audacious breakout bid in an email to staff last week			0
he said : ‘ regarding students digging a hole under the fence to escape ... i have some updates			1
’ he said groundsmen had ‘ filled in the hole and put a metal bar across the bottom of the fence in that area			1
‘ however , can staff on duty on the back field please keep an eye on them digging any more holes for this purpose in other areas along the fence			2
assistant head @entity55 wrote about the audacious breakout bid in an email to staff last week ‘ quite a lot of cutlery was found in the area , presumably stolen from the canteen to aid their digging , so if staff on the duty can keep an eye on students smuggling cutlery out of the canteen ... ’ housewife @entity89 , whose home backs onto the school playing fields , said of the escape bid : ‘ i ca n’t believe they would even try such a thing			1
since they put in the new fencing , we have all thought it was impossible for any pupil to get out			0
‘ it can be noisy in the back garden sometimes			0
i hear a lot of shouting and swearing – but never any digging			0
’ former pupil @entity103 , 20 , described the school as ‘ security mad ’ , adding : ‘ they have even had a marked car patrolling the area looking for truants			2
they give out fines if your child truants a lot			0
’ he added : ‘ it would not be easy to dig a hole under that fence with a spade let alone a spoon			1
‘ when i was there in 2005 , the fencing was smaller and we could slip out and go home for lunch			0
i guess that is what they were trying to do			0
most secondary schools will let you go but @entity128 has never allowed it			0
that ’s why they built the bigger fencing			0
’ the school has now imposed tighter security measures after the bid for freedom - which could have come straight out of @entity2 ( above ) the school , which is in the deprived @entity137 area of the city , is in ‘ special measures ’ after an inspection by the watchdogs @entity142 last year ruled it was ‘ inadequate ’			1
it has suffered from high truancy rates , and pupils aged under 16 are not allowed out of the grounds without permission during the day			1
@entity142 also noted in its report : ‘ students ’ conduct , particularly outside lessons , shows a lack of respect for belonging to the academy			0
’ ms @entity32 said : ‘ we can confirm that five pupils tried to leave the school at lunchtime by getting below the fence on the fields at our @entity163 site			2
‘ we have spoken to the students concerned , and taken action to repair the hole			2
that part of the fence has also been reinforced			0
our staff are supervising that area to ensure our students stay safe and in school			2
