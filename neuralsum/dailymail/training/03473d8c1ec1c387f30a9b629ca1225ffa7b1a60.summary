by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 yesterday batted away @entity5 demands to help middle class families despite increasing pressure to help the 1.4million extra earners dragged into the 40p tax trap since he came to power			1
there are growing calls for ministers to help middle earners in next week ’s budget , thousands of whom have been dragged into paying the 40p rate of tax over the past three years			1
it is thought the number of higher rate taxpayers could hit nearly five million by next year ’s election			2
prime minister @entity3 , on a visit to the @entity26 parliament , played down expectations that he could act to help those caught in the 40p tax band by freezing or lowering the 40p tax rate , the number of earners caught in the bracket has risen to 4.4million under the coalition yesterday a leading @entity35 peer , @entity36 , joined the growing furore over a tax which is being paid by people who do not consider themselves wealthy			1
@entity36 , the former chairman of the influential @entity40 , said nearly one in six taxpayers are paying higher rate tax			2
in 1978 , it was just one in 33			0
he said : ‘ i think that that is a big issue			0
[ it is ] taxation by stealth - people do n’t realise what that is			0
’ in may 2010 , the month that the coalition government was formed , a worker became a higher rate taxpayer when their salary hit £ 43,875			2
but @entity60 has repeatedly lowered , or frozen , the salary level at which a worker starts to pay tax at 40 per cent			2
today you are a higher rate taxpayer if you are paid £ 41,450			1
to make matters worse , the ‘ starting salary ’ will barely rise for the next two years , increasing by just one per cent a year to £ 41,865 next month and £ 42,285 in april 2015			2
traditionally , it would be increased at a far more generous rate , rising in line with the retail prices index measure of inflation , but the chancellor scrapped this plan			2
speaking in @entity26 , mr @entity3 said the coalition was focusing on increasing the personal tax allowance @entity5 mp @entity75 ( left ) said help for the poor should not be at the expense of the middle classes while @entity5 mp @entity80 backed the idea of scrapping the 40p rate altogether the national minimum wage is to increase by 19p an hour to £ 6.50 later this year , giving more than a million workers a pay rise			1
the rate for 18 to 20 - year - olds will go up by 10p to £ 5.13 an hour - a 2 per cent increase			1
for 16 and 17 - year - olds the statutory rate will rise by 7p to @entity91 , also 2 per cent			0
the minimum wage for apprentices will go up by 5p to £ 2.73 an hour , with all the new rates coming into force in october			2
the government said it had accepted recommendations from the @entity98 , including plans for bigger increases in future than in recent years			0
business secretary @entity102 said : ' the recommendations i have accepted today mean that low - paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take home pay since 2008			0
' this will benefit over one million workers on national minimum wage and marks the start of a welcome new phase in minimum wage policy			0
' senior @entity114 are demanding a big increase in the salary threshold at which people start to pay the 40p rate to around £ 44,000			1
but mr @entity3 repeatedly brushed aside concerns about the impact of so - called ‘ fiscal drag ’ yesterday when asked about the growing political controversy			0
speaking on a trip to @entity26 , he said : ‘ i am a tax - cutting conservative - i want to see us relieve people ’s tax burden			0
‘ we have chosen to do that through raising the personal allowance , which helps everyone earning under £ 100,000			0
’ @entity80 , a @entity5 mp and a member of the number 10 policy unit , said : ‘ it is right that if there is any money in the kitty , it should go towards those at the lower end of the pay spectrum			1
’ but he showed his support for a radical proposal from @entity143 , a campaign group aiming to broaden the appeal of the conservative party , to abolish the 40p tax rate			1
under its proposals , the 40p tax rate would be scrapped and the 45p tax rate , which is currently paid by people earning more than £ 150,000 , would be lowered to £ 62,000			1
@entity151 , a director of renewal , said : ‘ @entity60 should take a major step to unwind the undesirable drift towards an ever higher proportion of the working population paying higher rate tax			0
‘ in doing so , he could relieve the pressure on the squeezed middle , so many of whom have borne the burden of paying for @entity35 ’s profligacy			0
’ speaking at @entity163 , @entity3 ’s favourite think - tank , mr @entity80 said : ‘ we need our iconic tax policy			2
‘ i think @entity168 ’s contribution and his suggestion that we abolish the 40p rate and pay for it by lowering the 45p threshold was a great way of starting the conversation			1
’ but mr @entity3 ’s comments will dismay senior @entity114 pushing for the 40p threshold to be raised to ease the pain on higher earners , particularly in the @entity179 where high housing costs eat into disposable income			1
increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010 of the 4.4million higher rate taxpayers , 834,000 live in the @entity179 followed by 817,000 in @entity189 , according to figures from @entity191			1
@entity192 , the former @entity5 cabinet minister , said there is now a clear case for helping those on ordinary incomes dragged into the 40p rate			1
he said : ‘ it is affecting not just those at the threshold limit , who find that a pay rise disappears , but people further down the income scale with aspirations			0
‘ we need lower taxes across the board			0
’ @entity75 , a leading @entity5 mp , said : ‘ it is right to ease the tax burden on the lowest paid , but that should not be done at the expense of the middle classes			1
‘ you should not be robbing middle class @entity214 to pay for working class @entity216			0
we need to cut taxes across the board			0
