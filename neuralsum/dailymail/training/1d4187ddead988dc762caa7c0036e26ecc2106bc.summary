bad job : dr @entity1 , a gp , caught at the till of his @entity4 restaurant in @entity5 family doctors are moonlighting at private surgeries while their @entity9 patients are forced to wait weeks for appointments			1
an investigation by @entity12 has found dozens of gps earning huge sums by taking time out from their @entity9 jobs to treat private patients			1
many are happy to carry out private consultations in the evenings and weekends – even though their profession has strongly resisted @entity23 pressure to open @entity9 surgeries at these times			2
while patients who can pay up to £ 100 for a private appointment can be seen within hours , @entity9 patients must wait for up to three weeks			1
the doctors are not breaking any rules , but critics say their absence from @entity9 surgeries for many hours every week is severely limiting the time available for appointments			1
the revelations come after figures from the @entity38 showed that one in six of all consultations last year – some 47 million appointments – involved a wait of at least a week to see a doctor or nurse			1
a snapshot survey by this newspaper has found : last night , critics condemned the arrangements			0
@entity49 , of the @entity50 ’ @entity48 , said : ‘ you would expect their first duty of care to be with their patients			2
it ’s interesting that @entity13 can pick and choose where and when they work , but patients do n’t have that luxury			0
’ even other doctors echoed the criticism			0
dr @entity62 , who left the @entity9 to run a private practice in @entity64 , @entity65 , said : ‘ i would certainly feel very uncomfortable if i looked after a mix of @entity9 and private patients and @entity9 patients had to wait significantly longer to be seen than patients who were able to pay			1
’ our investigation has uncovered at least 50 gps who spend several hours a week with paying customers			1
their @entity9 patients often have to wait days for appointments after struggling to get through on the phone			1
by contrast , receptionists in private surgeries answer straight away and can offer appointments at just a few hours ’ notice			2
curry on doctor : dr @entity1 's eaterie , @entity83 , in @entity84 , @entity5 a doctor whose surgery has been condemned by patients and watchdogs moonlights at a curry house			1
on friday , dr @entity1 was seen by @entity12 dealing with takeaway orders at the @entity83 restaurant in @entity84 , @entity5 , run by his wife @entity92			1
the 73 - year - old took his post behind the counter soon after 8pm , after his @entity9 surgery closed for the weekend			1
patients have slammed the service provided at @entity99 in @entity100 , where he is the only gp			0
one online review on @entity103 warned : ‘ avoid it like the plague			0
’ another stated : ‘ this is a terrible surgery			0
the staff are rude and never answer the phone			0
’ their concerns have been backed up by @entity112 ’s health watchdog , the @entity111 , which recently declared his practice did not meet any of 11 key standards and was placing patients at ‘ unacceptable risk ’			1
dr @entity1 , who has decided to retire at the end of the month , declined to comment			1
dr @entity119 splits his time between an @entity9 surgery and at his @entity122 in @entity123 , which charges £ 150 for a 15 - minute appointment			1
he said he was ‘ forced ’ into the private work after his @entity9 hours were reduced because of financial cuts			1
most gps in @entity112 are partners , which means they also run the business side of their practices			0
average earnings are £ 103,000			0
increasing numbers of @entity112 ’s 35,000 family doctors are ‘ salaried ’ , meaning they are paid by partners to work a set number of hours			2
out of hours : the doctor , who has decided to retire at the end of this month , began his shift at 8pm , just after his surgery closed for the weekend their average earnings are lower at £ 56,800 but their contracts leave them free to moonlight in the private sector , where pay is much higher			1
dr @entity147 @entity146 works weekdays in a @entity9 clinic in @entity149 , @entity150 , where some patients have to wait three weeks to be seen			1
but on saturdays she works at the private @entity154 - run @entity152 – which charges £ 95 for a consultation			1
she said : ‘ i am contracted to work seven sessions a week ( 35 hours ) within the @entity9			1
i frequently exceed these hours			0
i choose to spend my “ spare ” hours doing work including one session a week at @entity154			0
’ court out : dr @entity161 attends to @entity162 at @entity163 in 2011 , after he was hit by the serve of @entity165 patients of dr @entity167 will have to wait until next month as to see her – as she ’s taking time off from @entity168 to become the official ‘ club doctor ’ of the tennis tournament on the clinic ’s doorstep			1
dr @entity161 , 61 , said she could n’t comment on her ‘ high - profile job ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s nobody ’s business			2
i do n’t think my patients are affected at all			0
anyway , you have no idea whether i ’m on annual leave or working part time			0
’ anonymous patients on the @entity103 website , above , have slated her surgery for the ‘ frustrating experience ’ of booking an appointment			2
dr @entity187 and dr @entity188 , who work at @entity190 ’s @entity189 – rated as ‘ absymal ’ on the @entity103 patients ’ review website – also ply their trade at @entity195 , which offers a 24 - hour call - out service and charges £ 90 for a consultation			1
dr @entity187 said he had an @entity9 contract to work a set number of hours , but outside that he can take on other work			1
he added : ‘ i wish i had funding for a weekend service for our @entity9 patients			1
we used to do so on saturday mornings but funding was withdrawn			0
’ three gps who work in the @entity9 also do shifts at the @entity209 , attached to the upmarket @entity210 in @entity211 , @entity212			2
one of them , dr @entity214 , runs the @entity215 which has received a poor review from the @entity111 watchdog			0
@entity9 gp @entity119 charges his private patients £ 150 for a 15 - minute appointment at the @entity122 in @entity123			1
but at the @entity222 where he works , in @entity223 , waiting times can be up to three weeks , say patients on @entity103 website			0
dr @entity119 says he works 24 hours a week there , plus occasional weekends , and 20 hours a week privately			2
he says he only sees a ‘ handful ’ of patients in private practice , adding : ‘ patients at my @entity9 practice can always be seen the same day if it is urgent			1
routine patients can sometimes have a wait , especially to see me personally , but this is not dissimilar to very many @entity9 practices			2
dr @entity239 , a part - time @entity240 in @entity241 who also sees paying patients at the @entity245 private hospital , said doctors were turning to ad hoc private work because of the government ’s ‘ unsettling ’ overhaul of gp services			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t think doctors are skiving off to see private patients , but working extra hard in their spare time			0
doctors would not put money before patients – but they still need an income			0
’ although hospital consultants can also treat their @entity9 patients privately , and many do , gps are not allowed to offer paid treatment to their @entity9 patients			1
dr @entity262 of the @entity48 , the doctors ’ union , said there was little demand for private gp services in @entity112			0
many patients seen privately are thought to be from overseas and ineligible for free @entity9 care			2
health minister dr @entity269 blamed the former @entity271 government for ‘ botching ’ the 2004 gp contract , saying : ‘ it vandalised the relationship between patients and doctors as it allowed @entity13 to opt out of providing out - of - hours services			1
‘ now we pay a premium to get @entity13 to do what they once did for free			0
what we want is to see @entity13 providing extended opening hours and extra appointments			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity283 said the @entity284 must take responsibility as ‘ patients will find these revelations hard to stomach ’			2
we know from our helpline , where we hear from patients on a daily basis about the issues they have trying to see their gp , that it ’s almost impossible to get a same - day appointment , which results in many patients having to go to @entity297			0
some patients tell us they have to wait four days and they face the frustration of having to ring the surgery every morning to see if there is an appointment			0
no one knows when they ’re going to need to see a gp , so the services in primary care should be available to the public when the public needs them			0
shocked : chief executive of the @entity310 says she receives hoards of complaints about waits of up to four days for appointments patients should have access to @entity317 and the @entity240 should be the first point of contact for anyone who requires healthcare			0
it ’s a vicious circle for patients – because of @entity13 ’ non-availability at certain times , they ’re not able to access the service			0
it ’s the responsibility of the commissioner that a safe service is accessible and available to patients when they need it			0
the vast majority of patients would n’t be able to exercise the choice of seeing their gp privately because they ca n’t afford to , and why should they have to pay to see their gp ? they ’re already paying for a health service that should be available when they need it			2
ultimately , the accountability lies with the @entity9 commissioners			0
they should make sure that there is a service in the community , and that if gps have available time it should be used seeing @entity9 patients			1
there is no continuity of care out of hours , and this is the danger to patients when the service is n’t provided by their gp but by private contractors			2
this is because they have very little knowledge of local services and the history of the patient , which is obviously important if they have got long - term conditions			2
we ’ve been told by the @entity38 that many gps are retiring over the next couple of years			0
if we ’re going to get the @entity9 patient - centred , it is really important that the appropriate services are available to the public in the community , so that we stop people from turning up at @entity297 because it ’s the only place with the light always on .			0
