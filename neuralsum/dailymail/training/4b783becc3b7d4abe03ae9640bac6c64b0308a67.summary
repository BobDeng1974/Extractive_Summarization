@entity1 gunman sent a notebook filled with details and drawings about how he was going to kill people to his university psychiatrist one week before the shooting - but it sat unopened in the campus mail room			1
the revelation will undoubtedly lead many to come to the awful conclusion the massacre could have been prevented and 12 lives could have been spared			1
a law enforcement source told @entity15 that the package was only discovered on monday but they suspect it had lain there undetected since july 12			1
bizarre behavior : @entity20 , pictured at his first court appearance on monday , was involved with a number of prostitutes in the months before the massacre no sense : students and faculty who knew mr @entity20 from the @entity28 at @entity29 scrambled via e-mail to make sense of the shooting bomb scare : although that package turned out to be from someone else and harmless , a search of the @entity38 ' mailroom turned up another package disturbing : a poster on the wall is seen inside the apartment where accused killer @entity43 lived @entity20 ' name was written in the return address box			1
the package was turned up after an extensive search of the campus ' mail room			1
it is not known why it was not delivered to its intended recipient			2
authorities then obtained a warrant from a district judge to open the package , which is when its chilling contents were discovered			1
respectable family : @entity20 's father @entity59 is a talented scientist who works for a financial services company in @entity61 the source told @entity15 : ' inside the package was a notebook full of details about how he was going to kill people			1
' there were drawings of what he was going to do in it - drawings and illustrations of the massacre			1
' the spiral - bound pad was said to be filled with gun - wielding stick figures blowing away other stick figures			1
the notebook is now in the possession of the @entity82 but it has fueled speculation that an earlier discovery could have prevented the senseless tragedy which unfolded at a @entity87 movie theater less than a week ago			1
police and @entity82 agents were called to the @entity28 's @entity91 medical campus in @entity92 on monday morning after the psychiatrist and professor at the school reported receiving a package believed to be from the suspect			1
though the package in question turned out to be from someone else , this prompted an extensive search of the campus mail room which uncovered the notebook			1
it is not yet clear whether or not the psychiatrist had any previous contact with @entity20 but it is likely , considering that the 24 - year - old studied various mental health issues before he dropped out of the university 's neuroscience program			1
the psychiatrist was also a professor at the college			0
the @entity113 reported today that @entity20 asked a prison guard if he had watched @entity115 yet and how the film ended			1
the 24 - year - old bought a ticket to the midnight screening but allegedly left after half an hour to put on the body armor stored in his care before returning to the theater and opening fire			1
a jail employee told the @entity113 that @entity20 's voice was flat and his eyes glazed over when he asked , and repeated the question when he was ignored			2

when i knew @entity20 , the @entity87 shooter , he was @entity159			0
i was his fifth - grade teacher and he lives in a tiny town of 5,000 called @entity161			2
recalling him at school , he was well - dressed , neat , wore glasses , liked to read and excelled in all academic areas			2
he had two really good friends , both sharp like him — in fact , top of the class			0
what happened to him ? @entity20 had everything going for him			0
he lived in the wealthy part of town ; i ’m pretty sure both of his parents had white - collar jobs			2
how can we know what happened ? ” iperhaps he became psychotic			0
it shows up in people in their 20s			0
maybe he used wicked sanity - eating drugs like @entity185 , meth , crack , and it destroyed his mind			2
some people will always snap			0

prison officials fitted him with a black plastic face guard to stop him from spitting on guards			1
it emerged today that three days before he dropped out of university , @entity20 failed a key exam , prompting him to buy a terrifying arsenal of weapons			0
experts have suggested that it may have been the stress of failing the exam coupled with the pressure to follow in his brilliant father 's over-achieving footsteps which triggered an underlying mental illness			0
