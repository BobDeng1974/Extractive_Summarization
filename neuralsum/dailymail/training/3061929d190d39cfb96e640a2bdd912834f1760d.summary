the great recession was a calamity			0
@entity29 ’s workers have borne many of the consequences			0
’ but he added : ‘ the point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer			1
you can expect interest rates to begin to rise			1
’ economists expect interest rates , frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent since march 2009 , will be ‘ beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually ’ , he said			1
it raises the explosive prospect of the first rise for seven years hitting homeowners weeks before the general election in may			0
