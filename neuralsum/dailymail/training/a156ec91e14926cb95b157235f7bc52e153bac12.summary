@entity0 will demand a ground - breaking £ 500,000 - a - week to join either @entity2 or @entity3 next summer			1
@entity4 star @entity0 last week confirmed a story @entity6 broke 18 months ago that he was on the verge of re-joining @entity3 in the summer of 2013			1
that deal was scuppered by the departure of sir @entity10 and the fact that @entity3 were not prepared to pay @entity0 what he wanted and eventually got on a new deal with @entity4 which is in the region of £ 350,000 - a - week			1
you can like our @entity3 facebook page here @entity0 will demand £ 500,000 - a - week to join either @entity2 or @entity3 next summer @entity0 scored a penalty in @entity4 's 2 - 1 defeat against @entity21 on saturday since then , @entity3 have given @entity22 a £ 300,000 - a - week contract and last week signed @entity24 on a deal which will earn the @entity26 £ 280,000 - a - week			1
@entity24 ’s deal was sealed by super-agent @entity28 , who is also @entity0 ’s agent			1
that @entity3 's @entity31 owners the @entity29 have been prepared to loosen the purse strings to such an extent has encouraged @entity0 to consider a return back to the @entity35			1
indeed , @entity0 last week hinted that he could leave @entity4 next summer			1
and he would be ready to move back to @entity36 which was on the brink of happening in summer 2013 but the deal collapsed over the players wage demands			0
the new policy at @entity3 has now changed the financial dynamic			2
but , given the links @entity28 has with @entity2 boss @entity43 and owner @entity44 , @entity0 could also be tempted to a move to the west @entity47 club			1
@entity48 is being paid £ 390,000 - a - week by @entity3 after a move from @entity50 @entity22 ( right , talking to @entity51 ) earns £ 300,000 - a - week for playing at @entity36 @entity43 's close links with @entity0 's agent @entity28 could see the player sign for @entity2 i am hearing @entity56 , still boss of @entity58 club @entity57 , has re-emerged as a potential successor to @entity60 at @entity61 even though he turned down @entity62 before former manager @entity63 ( remember him ) was given the job after @entity65 was sacked			1
i am also hearing @entity61 are set to offer 18 - year - old starlet @entity66 , who is nowhere near the first team , a £ 4,000 - a - week contract to fend off interest from @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity70			1
@entity56 , boss of @entity57 , has re-emerged as a potential successor to @entity60 at @entity61 @entity72 its been a tough start for @entity75 at @entity3 but nothing can really compare to @entity78 ’s brief turbulent reign at @entity79			1
its 40 years ago this week that @entity78 was sacked by @entity79 after just six games , seven weeks , or more famously 44 days			1
a combination of his maverick managerial style and a set of @entity79 players who resented the fact that father - figure @entity87 , who had been appointed @entity90 manager , had been replaced by @entity78 and by not veteran start @entity91			1
to compound the situation @entity78 , who died ten years ago this week , did not disguise his loathing for the @entity79 approach to the game or indeed @entity87 himself			1
amazingly on the evening of his dismissal a @entity100 tv chat shot managed to get both @entity78 and @entity102 in the studio			2
in a an era before @entity105 spin doctors and candyfloss presenters @entity78 and @entity87 locked antlers and the outcome to was an amazing spat between the two men			2
it was tv in the raw of the like you will never see on @entity115 today			0
@entity78 ( right , next to @entity116 ) was sacked by @entity79 after just 44 days four decades ago this week @entity117 @entity118 said the @entity120 artificial pitch he played on for @entity121 in @entity122 was the worst surface he ’s ever played on in a proper game			1
pitches of the top level teams are now a subtle blend between turf and synthetics which makes for reliable bowling green surfaces that are evergreen , relatively forgiving and do n’t cut up			0
@entity118 said the pitch he played on in @entity122 was the worst surface he ’s ever played professionally mon : @entity133 should lose his cool and swear a bit more often			0
it seemed @entity133 has transferred some of his angst on to his players as @entity90 played with passion and purpose to win 2 - 0 against a strong @entity143 side in @entity144			2
tue : @entity145 hailed @entity118 as @entity121 ’ @entity146 , note not @entity0 , and @entity118 lived up to the billing in @entity122			2
wed : @entity149 quite rightly slams the @entity90 medical team for not applying basic sense ( as opposed to sport science ) which sees @entity153 get injured during international training when clearly he needed a rest not more work			0
thurs : after their worst ever @entity35 season @entity3 reveal they had a record revenue year - it would seem shirt sales in @entity160 , @entity161 and so on add up to more than silverware			1
fri : @entity163 , cleared of murder , but guilty of manslaughter for the de facto killing his female partner gets bail			0
but @entity169 is in high dudgeon for another drunken rumpus , arrested and by many demonised			0
but for all his faults - and lets not forget how much joy @entity175 gave the country - he never killed anyone			2
yet he could serve more time than @entity163			0
life ’s a pitch , and back in the day players had to play on all sorts of surfaces , in the winter months mainly mud or sometimes even snow			0
one of the worst was @entity186 ’s @entity185			0
yes they still played some great football under @entity78 then @entity189 in the @entity190			2
it was n’t all long ball back then by any stretch of the imagination as some would like to suggest now , but it ’s fair to say that often because the conditions defenders would look for an early ball into channels because passing the ball across the back ran the risk of the ball getting stuck in the mud , intercepted and a goal being given away			0
yet at the same some there was a generation of midfielders in that era such as @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 who imperiously glided through the mud with effortless ease during the @entity190 and @entity215			0
as @entity217 boss @entity216 used to say : ' great players can play on broken glass			0
' to be fair to @entity118 he is a great player and despite his moans he rose to the occasions in @entity122 and saved @entity121 from humiliating defeat as they came from behind to win 2 - 1 with him scoring both goals			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... btw @entity225 admitted the moment he knew he had to quit @entity90 was when @entity227 told him he did n’t know who @entity228 was			0
why is it not part of a scholarship at clubs that young players are told the history of the game ? @entity237 gets away from @entity239 's @entity238 on @entity186 's infamous @entity185 pitch in 1972 @entity227 ( right , next to @entity241 ) was n't aware who former @entity90 captain @entity228 was @entity243 why has @entity244 suddenly done a u-turn and argued for video replays ? maybe a man who was so against technology has recently reviewed the situation because of the commercial advantages			0
@entity251 president @entity244 has performed a sudden u-turn and argued for video replays			0

@entity0 could leave @entity4 at the end of the season
@entity22 and @entity48 are on huge wages at @entity3 - both earning more than £ 300,000 - a - week
@entity43 's links with @entity28 could sway it @entity2 's way
@entity78 was sacked by @entity79 40 years ago this week
@entity56 could replace @entity60 as @entity61 manager
