@entity0 and @entity1 are facing a new @entity3 threat after @entity4 performed a u-turn aimed at drafting @entity6 back into the @entity4 squad			1
the master playmaker has been an outstanding force for @entity10 in the @entity15 club 's back - to - back @entity12 triumphs and @entity18 title success last season			2
now , four years after his @entity20 career appeared to be over when he was left out for the last @entity3 , the 32 - year - old has discovered that he is eligible to play for the @entity4 again			1
@entity10 fly half @entity6 ( left ) takes on @entity25 centre @entity23 during the @entity26 semi-final former @entity4 @entity28 ( left ) and @entity6 have been integral to @entity10 's @entity30 dominance @entity6 has not featured for @entity4 since he missed out on selection for the @entity32 in @entity33 like @entity0 , @entity4 had a policy of not picking anyone who plays abroad			1
but @entity6 's supreme form for @entity10 led to a clamour for him to be recalled and on wednesday the @entity38 announced a change which is seemingly tailor - made for the man once known as @entity41			1
with immediate effect , @entity4 will pick ' elite ' players based abroad — providing they have 60 caps and seven years of professional service at home			1
at a stroke , the @entity4 have gained more experience and firepower for the @entity3 , while their @entity50 rivals @entity0 and @entity1 have extra cause for concern			1
former @entity0 lock @entity53 was a @entity10 team - mate during the victorious 2012 - 13 @entity30 campaign and the @entity56 academy director told @entity57 : ' when i turned up at @entity10 there were many excellent players , but the one guy who stood head and shoulders above the rest was @entity6			1
@entity65 who can play @entity6 ( @entity10 ) : can operate at @entity67 or centre			1
has excelled in @entity15 and craves another shot			0
@entity28 ( @entity10 ) : the 31 - year - old former @entity71 and @entity72 wing has 30 tries in his 63 test appearances			2
@entity75 ( @entity76 ) : openside with 111 caps was last picked by the @entity4 for 2013 decider against the @entity79			1
@entity0 stars @entity80 @entity81 @entity82 ( @entity83 ) : on shortlist for @entity86 award			0
@entity87 ( @entity10 ) : reigning @entity88 and having another superb campaign			2
@entity90 ( @entity91 ) : usurped by @entity94 in the @entity0 team , the rise of @entity93 has left him off the radar			0
' i had watched him play for years but seeing him in training , seeing what he could do , was a shock			2
he is just so talented and is still one of the best players in the world			2
' his ability is incredible , as is his decision - making			0
he 's still got pace , his passing is so accurate and he 's got a great kicking game			0
defensively he gets stuck in , too			0
he 's a great all - round player and , if anything , he has improved from spending time in @entity15			0
he can do it all			0
' @entity6 himself greeted the announcement from @entity113 on wednesday by tweeting : ' massive news re policy change			1
the ultimate honour to represent your country , however form still must warrant selection			0
' that should n't be an issue			0
his @entity10 team - mate , @entity28 , is another @entity65 who could find himself back in @entity3 contention but his initial reaction was to champion @entity6 's claims			1
' the fact he is not only playing in @entity30 but dominating it for a number of years — he not only would be able to handle @entity20 rugby , he 'd add a great deal of value in the @entity3 squad , ' said @entity28 @entity137 lock @entity53 considers his former team - mate @entity6 one the best players in the world the @entity38 decision has been made in response to an exodus of leading lights to @entity30			1
there are potential implications for the clubs who have recruited these players , who may now be called upon for @entity20 duty rather than being able to commit themselves fully to their new employers throughout the season			2
that in turn may lead to renewed club v country tension , but not in the case of @entity159 , who have signed @entity4 lock and former captain @entity162			2
' it 's not an issue for us , ' said @entity166 , @entity159 ' director of rugby			0
' we never want our players to turn their backs on playing for their country and there are windows for that			0
if the @entity4 wanted to pick @entity162 , that 's great			2
' @entity162 ( above ) has recently signed for @entity159 but will still be eligible to play for the @entity4 @entity4 's revised stance will lead to further calls for the @entity176 to relax their policy against picking players based abroad but @entity180 's @entity0 flanker @entity179 on wednesday echoed comments by @entity182 of @entity183 about the threat to squad unity and morale if the ' exceptional circumstances ' clause is invoked to call up the likes of @entity87 from @entity10			1
' i am not against it in principle but i would n't like us to back - pedal on that now , ' he said			0
' it could have an effect on the team and undermine some of the togetherness we have built			0
' if people start to lose faith and think there is an imbalance , then people are n't pulling in the same direction			0
' @entity179 ( right ) believes @entity206 should still not select overseas players such as @entity87			1

@entity4 have relaxed their policy on selecting overseas players
the @entity4 can now pick ' elite ' players based abroad
provided they have 60 caps and seven years of service at home
@entity6 has starred for @entity10 in recent seasons
the former @entity4 fly half is set for a recall for the @entity3
