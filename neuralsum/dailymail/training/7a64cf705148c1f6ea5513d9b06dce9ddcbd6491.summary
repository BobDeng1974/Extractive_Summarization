click here to read @entity2 's column reference to @entity3 as the ' ginger @entity4 '			1
@entity6 has labelled @entity3 as the ' ginger @entity4 ' after calling the @entity8 midfielder up to the @entity10 squad			1
the 24 - year - old will enjoy his first taste of international football after impressing at the back end of last season with @entity16 before a controversial move to @entity18			1
' someone who knows him very well called @entity3 the " @entity21 " - let 's hope that becomes true , ' said @entity6 , whose side face @entity24 and @entity26 next week			1
while the comment was n't made with any level of expectation attached - harking back to @entity42 's @entity2 's column about the youngster earlier this month - @entity6 has sparked anger among supporters online			2
one disgruntled fan said : ' if @entity3 ever plays for @entity10 i 'm moving country and supporting @entity49			1
' many vented on @entity51 , but @entity3 's pass completion percentage was remarkably higher than that of the mercurial @entity55 last season			2
@entity4 did , however , create treble the chances while at @entity57 and made more goals			0
fresh start : @entity6 announced his new - look @entity10 squad at @entity61 on thursday @entity2 said on august 18 : ' @entity3 is @entity10 class – his set - pieces are phenomenal			1
and he ’s got bottle as well			0
' this kid is n’t stupid			0
he ’s a @entity66 who ’s well aware of the passions on @entity18 and @entity68			0
these fans do n’t hold back when it comes to rivalries			0
even punching a horse is n’t off limits when it ’s @entity8 vs @entity16			0
' so for a @entity8 fan to make the move from @entity16 to @entity76 , and on a free transfer – well , you ’ve got to admire @entity3 ’s balls			1
' and check out his @entity8 debut			0
sure they lost , but you ’ve got to have a small - minded football brain to think there were no positives for @entity87 after the match , and @entity3 was one of them			2
pass master : @entity3 's completion rate was actually higher than @entity4 's last season ' he ’s the @entity93 , trusted with the set - pieces , and delivering good service with most of them			1
i like this kid , and i ca n’t help thinking that if he ’d come through at @entity98 , @entity99 or even the ' boutique ' academy at @entity102 , @entity3 would have had an @entity10 call - up by now			2
' meanwhile , @entity4 will miss the first month of the @entity105 season because of a bruised right hip			0
he was injured in a pre-season match and @entity57 say he 's pulled a tendon that requires 30 days to heal			0
he will miss @entity110 's games next week and the old lady 's @entity112 opener			1
@entity115 players tried too hard - @entity87			0

@entity10 manager @entity6 likened the @entity8 midfielder to @entity110 's @entity4
@entity3 will enjoy his first taste of international football
