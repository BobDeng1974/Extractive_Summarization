by @entity1 reporter published : 19:27 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 16 december 2013 a device created by a @entity4 dental hygienist is receiving high marks from an @entity7 coach after it has helped him call plays on the field during even the most inclement , vision impairing snow storms			1
six years ago , 56 - year - old @entity13 developed - and patented - a color - coded contraption that essentially looks like a collection of different colored paint swatches attached by a key ring			1
@entity13 , who in addition to being a dental hygienist also is a volunteer softball coach , created the device to help and other coaches relay signs to players on the field			1
she called it the @entity26			0
@entity26 : the @entity27 have started using the @entity26 , a device invented by a @entity4 woman who sent it to coach @entity31 now , at least one @entity7 coach has taken notice , and is using the device himself			1
' all i did , i sent [ @entity27 coach ] @entity31 a note and said , i know you use color squares and pictures for signs , i thought maybe you might like this , ' @entity13 tells the @entity43 of her new connection with the @entity45 - leading @entity27			1
' if nothing else happens in my life with the @entity26 , at least i made it to the @entity27			1
' shortly after sending @entity50 , she got a letter - as well as a check for $ 25 ( the @entity26 costs $ 24.99 ) - from @entity31			1
on a note accompanying the check , @entity31 wrote , ' it 's been a big help ! ! great idea ! ! ' clever : @entity13 ( left ) invented the @entity26 while coaching softball in her native @entity4 ' i have no clue what they 're using it for , ' @entity13 told @entity62			1
' they have so much going on on the sidelines , you see @entity31 with his tongue out talking , somebody doing hand signals			2
they could be using it as a decoy for all i know			0
' whatever the team is using it for , it 's definitely using it - as the @entity43 reports , @entity27 intern @entity75 can often be seen maneuvering the @entity26 ’s “ six baseball - bat - shaped , 9 - inch blades ( fanning ) out in all directions , ” as if to relay varied signals from sideline coaches to personnel on the field			2
@entity31 , however , wo n't tip his hand as to how he is using the @entity26 during games			2
' it 's just another way to communicate what we 're doing on game days , ' he said of the @entity50 at a press conference			0
@entity13 , however , is ecstatic to see her invention used on the field			0
multi-use : the @entity26 is n't just for football - it can be used in any sport that requires coaches communicating with players on the field ' oh , my @entity102 , i just saw it , ' the mother of three and grandmother of two told @entity62 last week while watching a video of an @entity27 game at her home			2
' this is so exciting			0
we are so psyched that they would keep winning			0
' @entity109 has setup a website for her invention , on which she describes the product as ' an innovative way to communicate with athletes			0
the clearly visible color blades make it easy for your players to read signs while keeping your opponents guessing as they sort through thousands of possible combinations ! use the same signals all season by disguising them with the use of indicator blade ( s ) , or changing the number , position , or direction of the blades			0
now being used in the @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134			0

@entity4 dental hygienist @entity13 invented the ' @entity26 ' six years ago when she was a volunteer softball coach
she sent @entity27 coach @entity31 one of her devices over the *summer* and he started using it to call plays from the sidelines
@entity31 sent @entity13 a check for $ 25 ( the cost of the @entity26 ) and a thank you letter
