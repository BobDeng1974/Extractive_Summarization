by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 4 december 2013 a new study has shown persistent noise may hinder the development of young children by interfering with the growth of blood vessels in the brain			1
file picture it may be all too tempting to put a baby in front of the television or play music to soothe them - but scientists fear it might be doing them permanent damage			2
@entity18 , persistent noise may have a long - term impact on the development of a child ’s brain , new research suggests			2
scientists warn that even relatively low sound - such as a television turned on quiet or the background noise of a washing machine - may cause harm if it is left on for more than a few hours			1
they think it could alter the development of babies and toddlers under the age of two , creating potential problems in later life			0
neurologist dr @entity35 said persistent noise of more than ten hours a day may stop blood vessels being formed in babies ’ brains			1
long - term impacts could include an increased susceptibility to diseases such as diabetes , high blood pressure and accelerated ageing			0
researchers at @entity46 played low noise to young mice for ten hours a day , for a period of ten days			1
they found that the stimulation reduced the number of blood vessels being formed by 10 to 15 per cent , significantly reducing the oxygen that could reach the brain			1
dr @entity35 said : ‘ the most striking relevance of this paper is that humans in a modern society are exposed to sounds that are quite similar to the ones that we played to the mice			2
‘ there are children that are exposed to this kind of constant noise through environmental noise and persistent music			2
’ recordings played to the mice included a random assortment of sounds , including static ‘ white noise ’ and mouse noises			2
the sounds were played at 40 to 60 decibels - the volume of normal conversation , a vacuum cleaner or a quiet television			0
dr @entity35 said : ‘ they sounds were not very loud but very persistent			0
‘ it was not enough to cause any ear damage - babies are probably exposed to much louder volumes			0
‘ and it had a very , very dramatic effect on the formation of new blood vessels			2
researchers at @entity46 warned even relatively low sounds , including having the television turned on quietly , could cause harm			1
file picture ‘ the interesting part is that the effect only occurs if you stimulate the mice at a particular age - before one month after birth , which is the equivalent of a one - to - two - year - old human			0
’ he added : ‘ these repetitive sounds did n’t really exist 100 years , 200 years ago			0
but in modern society we are exposing kids to these repetitive sounds			0
‘ they are continually exposed to environmental noises , music , video games , television			0
’ the study , published in @entity111 , also found that putting a mouse on a treadmill for several hours or repeatedly stimulating their whiskers had the same effect on blood vessel growth			0
dr @entity35 said : ‘ the results indicate that there is a general principal that too much stimulation of the nervous system by this repetitive stimulation causes an implication for the formation of blood vessels			1
‘ mild stimulation - what you would call normal or healthy stimulation - does not cause any effect on blood vessels			1
‘ but what is not perfectly fine is to have these repetitive noises which are persistent			0
that is a stressful situation for the brain when it is vulnerable because it is developing these new connections and new blood vessels			1
’ he said more research is needed to firmly establish whether the findings were applicable in humans , but he added : ‘ this is a public health issue which we think should be taken seriously			1

scientists at @entity46 discovered noise stimulation in young mice reduced the number of blood vessels being formed in the brain
even relatively low sounds , including the television , could harm children
neurologist warns public health issue must be taken seriously
