it is tough in the public eye			0
’ @entity0 can remember being wowed by a 14 - year - old @entity3 on the books at @entity46 , but was unable to convince @entity47 to commit the money required to sign him			1
instead , @entity3 headed to @entity50 for £ 600,000 in 2010			1

he added : ‘ i ’m sure @entity63 could still do a job for a @entity86 side but i ’m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than @entity7			1
he can earn £ 1 a week or £ 200,000 , he ’ll still play the same way			2
that ’s a dying breed – there are n’t many of them about			0
