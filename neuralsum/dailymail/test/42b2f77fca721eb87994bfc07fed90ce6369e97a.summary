@entity0 insists @entity2 ’s transfer ambitions will not be compromised by their inability to offer @entity5 football – as they step up their pursuit of @entity7			1
while @entity8 remain favourites to land the exciting @entity11 international , @entity2 were given permission by @entity13 to hold with @entity14			2
@entity15 have also spoken to the 21 - year - old , who scored 21 goals in the @entity18 this season			2
@entity0 is hoping @entity7 will choose @entity2 as his next destination @entity13 are looking for £ 25million for @entity7 , who has also been linked with @entity21 , and while @entity0 would neither confirm nor deny @entity2 ’s interest , he did acknowledge it is players of @entity14 ’s quality he is aiming to attract			1
@entity0 does not intend to be as busy as last year when he made eight new signings – @entity27 ’s @entity26 and @entity28 of @entity29 are prime targets , while @entity32 striker @entity31 could be an option – but @entity14 is a marker of their ambitions			2
how , though , will they lure targets from outside the top four ? @entity2 ’s recent history is littered with moves for big players that collapsed – @entity42 are @entity43 are prime examples – and taking a backward step this season will not have helped them			1
@entity0 , who saw similar failings hinder his side in a tepid 0 - 0 draw with @entity51 , accepts there is a big challenge facing @entity2 this summer but is confident they will be able to bring in the required quality			1
@entity51 striker @entity56 stretches out his right leg to poke ball away from defender @entity59 @entity61 striker @entity60 keeps his eyes focused on the ball on a rare start for @entity2 at the @entity65 @entity2 captain @entity66 plays a pass under pressure from @entity51 midfielder @entity69 @entity70 is sent tumbling to the turf by a sliding tackle from @entity51 defender @entity73 @entity74 ( home ) - may 2 @entity76 ( away ) - may 9 @entity77 ( home ) - may 16 @entity79 ( away ) - may 24 when asked if @entity2 had held talks with @entity14 , @entity0 replied : ‘ the kid is obiously a very talented player			1
‘ it is clear we need a goal threat for next season			0
there will be a raft of players that will be looked at			0
then it will be up to the club to see if they are affordable and available			0
there are targets that have been identified as a priority			0
we will have to see if they are available			0
’ inevitably , there will be players who @entity0 would like to sign that wo n’t consider joining @entity2 simply because they are not in the @entity5 but the manager believes they have done enough since he arrived to withstand this season ’s setback			1
‘ if we are not in the @entity5 , players will still maybe want to come , ’ said @entity0 , who could be without @entity66 at @entity103 tomorrow night after he picked up a “ knock ”			1
‘ but if it ’s right for the players , and the project is right for them to learn and develop , i think if they have watched us over a few years , if we can regroup and get some quality starters in , we can go on another great adventure and get back in there			0
‘ if we are looking to regain what we had last season , we need that tempo to our game and our approach play			0
if we can do that , we will have an opportunity to really kick on again			0
’ @entity2 remain fifth in the @entity120 - five points seven points behind @entity8 in fourth @entity2 's @entity122 punches a cross away under pressure from @entity51 defender @entity125 @entity51 defender @entity73 tugs @entity70 's shirt as he challenges him for the ball during the first half @entity51 duo @entity130 and @entity125 help stop a shot from @entity2 midfielder @entity132			2

@entity0 insists @entity2 can still attract the best players
@entity2 are unlikely to be able to offer @entity5 next season
@entity0 still believes players like @entity7 would move to the club
@entity14 has been linked with moves to whole host of @entity120 sides
