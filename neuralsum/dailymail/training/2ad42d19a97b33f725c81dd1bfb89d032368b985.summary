@entity1 officials secretly considered plans to provide homes with chemical weapons shelters amid fears of an attack by the @entity7 - but the scheme quickly ran into difficulties			1
files released by the @entity11 show that the plan foundered after experts pointed out that people would have to remain in the sealed shelters for up to 10 hours in the aftermath of a chemical attack			1
it also emerged that @entity19 wanted @entity20 to acquire chemical weapons to counter the @entity7 threat during the @entity23			1
@entity25 - style instructions were drawn up for shelters where families could hide during chemical attacks the plan to offer families shelters to protect them from chemical weapons emerged in the last amid fears of an attack by the @entity7 ' as the cubic capacity was approximately 7 cubic metres , four people could be supported in the enclosed air for only about 2 - 3 hours , ' the minutes of a meeting from april 1985 noted			1
it was suggested that the air supply could be extended through the use of fans and filters - but again there was a difficulty			2
' it was immediately realised that finding room for them might be a problem , ' the minutes noted			0
other files reveal how the @entity19 said it was ‘ negligent ’ that @entity20 had not acquired chemical weapons as intelligence reports suggested that the enemy could use them against the @entity56			1
in a secret memo in @entity11 files at @entity59 , @entity60 , mrs @entity19 ’s private secretary , summarised a meeting on the subject in which then defence secretary @entity64 warned that a lack of chemical weapons was a ‘ major gap ’ in @entity69 ’s defences			1
‘ the defence secretary said that colleagues were aware of the threat posed by the @entity7 in this file			0
the absence of an adequate retaliatory capability was a major gap in @entity69 ’s armoury , ’ he wrote			0
‘ @entity77 on a nuclear response to chemical attack lacked credibility			0
possession of a very limited defensive capability was not a deterrent			0
’ he added : ‘ summing up the discussion , the prime minister said that it might be argued that it was negligent of the government not to acquire a chemical weapons capability			2
but this was not a decision which could be addressed at this stage			0
’ the shelters , including this igloo - style design , were later discovered to be unfit for purpose the shelters were likely to have been inspired by @entity99 shelters which were used during the @entity100 to seek refuge from @entity103 bombing raids a @entity105 paper from 1984 underlined the scale of the threat with an assessment that the @entity109 had over 300,000 tons of nerve agents alone			0
in contrast , @entity111 – which was the only @entity69 member to possess a chemical warfare ( @entity115 ) capability – had an ageing stockpile of just 31,000 tons which was not actually declared to @entity69			0
@entity20 abandoned its chemical weapons programme in the 1950s and kept only a nuclear capability , which was deemed a disproportionate response to an isolated chemical weapons attack on troops			1
in another secret paper from 1983 , officials make predictions of the death toll if the @entity7 attacked @entity20 with chemical weapons			1
a @entity1 working group calculated that a @entity109 @entity115 attack by just three aircraft on @entity131 would leave 16,350 dead and 29,000 injured while a similar attack on @entity134 dockyard would kill 33,350 and leave 42,000 injured			2
an official memo of july 1984 states : ‘ the home secretary attended a presentation in the @entity105 on 29 february at which the prime minister was present about the threat posed by the growing @entity7 capability in chemical weapons			1
‘ at that meeting it was agreed that a paper on chemical weapons ’ policy should be prepared by officials , and this was sent to the prime minister on 2 july			2
' @entity19 , pictured in 1986 , said it was ‘ negligent ’ that @entity20 had not acquired chemical weapons as intelligence reports suggested that the enemy could use them against the @entity56 the memo added : ‘ the paper ( which has been agreed at official level ) concludes that , whilst an attempt to achieve arms control should be the first priority despite uncertainties about the outcome , if these efforts fail the arguments for a @entity160 chemical weapons capability would be very strong … ‘ in its recommendations the paper invites ministers to consider a range of options for countering the military threat posed by chemical weapons , including a retaliatory capability			1
’ the fears arose out of intelligence reports that suggested that the @entity7 were building chemical weapons that could penetrate the @entity181 ( @entity182 ) weapons suits			1
‘ it is our intelligence judgment that the soviets have expanded their @entity115 capability , particularly in the area of penetrating agents , ’ the paper says			0
‘ we do not have specific evidence of new agents having actually been deployed into service with the @entity7 forces , but we are convinced that a new and serious chemical weapons threat exists			2
it is a threat that our current respirator and probably our present @entity182 suit can not defeat			0
’ but the paper also warns that it would be difficult to win over public opinion - especially because there was no protection available for the civilian population			0
the paper outlines four possible responses to the threat , including an ‘ independent @entity20 retaliatory capability , though the preferred solution is to continue with disarmament talks .			0
