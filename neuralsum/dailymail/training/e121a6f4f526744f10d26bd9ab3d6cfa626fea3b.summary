several parents unwittingly agreed to give up their eldest child in return for the use of free @entity5 , a study has revealed			1
thankfully , the deal was not binding but an experiment designed to highlight the dangers of using the public @entity5 internet			1
@entity10 were asked to agree to terms and conditions as they logged on to use free @entity5 in a cafe located in a busy financial district and at a site close to the @entity16			1
@entity10 were asked to agree to terms and conditions as they logged on to use free @entity5 in a cafe located in a busy financial district and at a site close to the houses of parliament the terms of access included a ‘ @entity29 clause ’ , under which the @entity5 was provided only if ‘ the recipient agreed to assign their first born child to us for the duration of eternity ’			1
in the short period the terms and conditions were live , six people signed up			1
‘ as this is an experiment , we will be returning the children to their parents , ’ joked @entity38 , the technology security firm that ran the experiment			1
the experiment aimed to highlight ‘ the total disregard for computer security by people when they are mobile , ’ according to the firm 's report			1
the @entity50 used in the test was small enough to be stashed in a handbag and was built by @entity54 ethical hacking company , @entity53 for € 200 ( £ 157 or $ 254 )			0
the terms of access included a ‘ @entity29 clause ’ , under which the @entity5 was provided only if ‘ the recipient agreed to assign their first born child to us for the duration of eternity ’			1
a stock image is pictured last month @entity63 unveiled an elite squad of hackers tasked with scouring the internet for security holes and defending the public against cyberattacks			2
' @entity70 ' will hunt for bugs in the world 's most popular software , such as @entity74 and @entity75			2
' you should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state - sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer , steal secrets or monitor your communications , ' @entity63 security researcher @entity76 said in a blog post			2
yet he said sophisticated attacks continue to target , for instance , human rights activists and businesses			0
' this needs to stop			0
we think more can be done to tackle this problem			0
' we 're hiring the best practically - minded security researchers and contributing 100 per cent of their time toward improving security across the internet			2
' in just 30 minutes , 250 devices connected to the hotspot - some of them doing so automatically due to their settings			0
the company was able to collect the text of emails they sent , the email addresses of the sender and recipient as well as the password of the sender			0
the head of @entity112 's @entity111 told the experts that criminals are already starting to offer free @entity5 hotspots in order to steal personal data			1
@entity124 , an @entity125 said : ‘ at best , your device is only leaking information about you and at worst , your passwords are being spilled into a publicly accessible space ... anybody on the network can see your information			2
’ the report said : ‘ our results illustrate the very real problem of the modern world which is that while massively dependent on the technology the population is unaware of its capabilities for surveillance and intrusion into their lives			0
‘ the problem is that people implicitly trust their technology and are not aware of the implications of that trust			0
‘ there is an insatiable pursuit of bandwidth , driven mainly by the desire to have video , data - rich apps and super-fast website performance on the move			0
‘ this appetite for bandwidth ... has blinded consumers to the risks that they are taking			0
in pursuit of free bandwidth , people are prepared to do anything as our experiment showed with its draconian terms and conditions			1

several parents agreed to the ' @entity166 ' in a contract because they did *n't* read terms and conditions of accessing free @entity5 in @entity170
in the short period the terms and conditions were live , six people signed up
experiment was set up to highlight people 's disregard for mobile security
criminals are now using @entity5 hotspots to steal *smartphone* and computer users ' personal *details* such as passwords and the content of *messages*
