by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:39 est , 30 november 2013 you can take our word for it			1
@entity7 do n't trust each other anymore			1
we 're not talking about the loss of faith in big institutions such as the government , the church or @entity14 , which fluctuates with events			0
for four decades , a gut - level ingredient of democracy - trust in the other fellow - has been quietly draining away			1
these days , only one - third of @entity7 say most people can be trusted			1
@entity20 felt that way in 1972 , when the @entity22 first asked the question			0
forty years later , a record high of nearly two - thirds say ' you ca n't be too careful ' in dealing with people			2
an @entity0 - @entity29 poll conducted last month found that @entity7 are suspicious of each other in everyday encounters			1
less than one - third expressed a lot of trust in clerks who swipe their credit cards , drivers on the road , or people they meet when traveling			1
@entity40 , 27 , says he is ' leery ' of almost everyone he meets and has trouble trusting people ' i 'm leery of everybody , ' said @entity40 , 27 , of @entity48 , @entity45 ' caution is always a factor			2
' does it matter that @entity7 are suspicious of one another ? yes , say worried political and social scientists			1
what 's known as ' social trust ' brings good things			2
a society where it 's easier to compromise or make a deal			0
where people are willing to work with those who are different from them for the common good			2
where trust appears to promote economic growth			1
distrust , on the other hand , seems to encourage corruption			2
at the least , it diverts energy to counting change , drawing up 100 - page legal contracts and building gated communities			0
even the rancor and gridlock in politics might stem from the effects of an increasingly distrustful citizenry , said april @entity77 , a @entity78 political scientist and public opinion researcher			0
' it 's like the rules of the game , ' @entity77 said			0
' when trust is low , the way we react and behave with each other becomes less civil			0
' he 's not alone : beliefs people develop in their twenties are likely to stay with them throughout the rest of their lives there 's no easy fix			1
in fact , some studies suggest it 's too late for most @entity7 alive today to become more trusting			1
that research says the basis for a person 's lifetime trust levels is set by his or her mid-twenties and unlikely to change , other than in some unifying crucible such as a world war			0
people do get a little more trusting as they age			2
but beginning with the baby boomers , each generation has started off adulthood less trusting than those who came before them			1
the best hope for creating a more trusting nation may be figuring out how to inspire today 's youth , perhaps united by their high - tech gadgets , to trust the way previous generations did in simpler times			1
there are still trusters around to set an example			0
@entity123 trusts people and even sells his produce next to an unlocked cash box @entity127 farmer @entity123 is one			1
he runs an unattended farm stand on the honor system			1
customers pick out their produce , tally their bills and drop the money into a slot , making change from an unlocked cashbox			0
both regulars and tourists en route to nearby @entity140 , @entity127 , stop for asparagus in spring , corn in summer and , as the weather turns cold , long - neck pumpkins for @entity146 pies			0
' when people from @entity148 or @entity149 come up , ' said @entity123 , 60 , ' they are amazed that this kind of thing is done anymore			1
' @entity123 has updated the old ways with technology			2
he added a video camera a few years back , to help catch people who drive off without paying or raid the cashbox			0
but he says there is n't enough theft to undermine his trust in human nature			0
a true believer in the honor system , @entity123 has an unattended farm stand ' i 'll say 99 and a half percent of the people are honest , ' said @entity123 , who 's operated the produce stand for two decades			1
there 's no single explanation for @entity7 ' loss of trust			1
the best - known analysis comes from ' @entity173 ' author @entity172 's nearly two decades of studying the @entity7 ' declining ' social capital , ' including trust			1
@entity172 says @entity7 have abandoned their bowling leagues and @entity178 lodges to stay home and watch tv			1
less socializing and fewer community meetings make people less trustful than the ' long civic generation ' that came of age during the @entity187 and @entity186 not self serving : this self service farm stand is based on trust and dignity @entity192 professor @entity191 , who studies politics and trust , puts the blame elsewhere : economic inequality			1
@entity197 has declined as the gap between the nation 's rich and poor gapes ever wider , @entity191 says , and more and more @entity7 feel shut out			2
they 've lost their sense of a shared fate			0
tellingly , trust rises with wealth			0
' people who believe the world is a good place and it 's going to get better and you can help make it better , they will be trusting , ' @entity191 said			2
' if you believe it 's dark and driven by outside forces you ca n't control , you will be a mistruster			0
' african - americans consistently have expressed far less faith in ' most people ' than the white majority does			1
racism , discrimination and a high rate of poverty destroy trust			0
' they are amazed that this kind of thing is done anymore , ' @entity123 said of visitors from @entity148 nearly 8 in 10 african - americans , in the 2012 survey conducted by @entity228 at the @entity229 with principal funding from the @entity231 , felt that ' you ca n't be too careful			1
' that figure has held remarkably steady across the 25 @entity22 surveys since 1972			0
the decline in the nation 's overall trust quotient was driven by changing attitudes among whites			0
it 's possible that people today are indeed less deserving of trust than @entity7 in the past , perhaps because of a decline in moral values			1
' i think people are acting more on their greed , ' said @entity249 , a computer specialist who says he has witnessed scams and rip - offs			2
' everybody wants a comfortable lifestyle , but what are you going to do for it ? where do you draw the line ? ' @entity261 behavior such as lying and cheating are difficult to document over the decades			0
it 's worth noting that the early , most trusting years of the @entity22 poll coincided with @entity266 and the @entity267			2
@entity197 dropped off in the more stable 1980s			0
crime rates fell in the 1990s and 2000s , and still @entity7 grew less trusting			1
many social scientists blame 24 - hour news coverage of distant violence for skewing people 's perceptions of crime			2
can anything bring trust back ? @entity191 and @entity77 do n't see much hope anytime soon			0
@entity279 , executive director of the @entity280 launched by @entity281 , believes the trust deficit is ' eminently fixable ' if @entity7 strive to rebuild community and civic life , perhaps by harnessing technology			1
after all , the @entity286 can widen the circle of acquaintances who might help you find a job			0
email makes it easier for clubs to plan face - to - face meetings			0
googling someone turns up information that used to come via the community grapevine			0
but hackers and viruses and hateful posts eat away at trust			0
and sitting home watching @entity304 means less time out meeting others			0
' a lot of it depends on whether we can find ways to get people using technology to connect and be more civically involved , ' @entity279 said			2
' the fate of @entity7 ' trust , ' he said , ' is in our own hands			1

an @entity0 - @entity29 poll conducted last month found that @entity7 are suspicious of each other in everyday encounters
less than one - third expressed a lot of trust in clerks who swipe their credit cards , drivers on the road , or people they meet when traveling
people stopped trusting each other during the baby boomer generation and beliefs people have in their twenties will likely stay with them
distrust encourages corruption whereas trust encourages economic growth
@entity123 , 60 , goes against the grain with his unattended farm stand based on the honor system
