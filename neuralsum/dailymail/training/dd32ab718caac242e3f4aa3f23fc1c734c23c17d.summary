by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 10:56 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 13:11 est , 5 december 2012 the chancellor pledged a crackdown on firms who get out of paying their fair share in corporation tax			1
@entity9 acted following growing fury over multinational companies like @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 who paid nothing or very little despite huge sales			2
in his @entity18 , he said he would give @entity19 a further £ 77million to fight tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and global firms			1
chancellor @entity9 pledged a crackdown on firms who get out of paying their fair share in corporation tax as he delivered his @entity18 to the @entity28 today and he claimed the crackdown will raise another £ 2billion a year which can be used to cut the deficit			1
the chancellor told @entity31 that he wanted a ' tax system where the richest pay their fair share '			1
' the vast majority of people , rich or otherwise , pay their taxes and make their contribution , ' he said			0
' but there are still too many who illegally evade their taxes , or use aggressive tax avoidance in order not to pay their fair share			1
' anger over tax avoidance reached a head last month when it emerged that coffee chain @entity14 had paid corporation tax in the @entity47 over the past 15 years despite millions of pounds in sales			1
internet companies @entity12 and @entity13 have also been accused of ' immoral ' tax regimes which means profits are diverted to other jurisdictions with lower tax rates			2
facing a higher tax bill : @entity13 , whose warehouse in @entity57 is pictured , will be one of the firms which pays a relatively small amount of tax to be targeted a @entity14 worker hands out hot chocolate to shoppers in @entity67 's @entity66 street today as mr @entity9 pledged to get tough with the company 's tax avoidance regime mr @entity9 said hundreds of millions of pounds of tax loopholes would be closed , and the @entity19 would investigate the abusive use of partnerships			1
he reminded @entity31 that the government would introduce the first - ever ' anti-abuse rule ' , and pointed out that a new treaty with @entity77 means that from next year for the first time there will be money flowing from @entity77 bank accounts to the @entity47 than the other way round			0
the chancellor said he expects to receive £ 5billion over the next six years from the undisclosed @entity77 bank accounts of @entity47 residents			0
he added : ' @entity19 will not have its budget cut over the next two years , unlike other departments			0
instead we will spend £ 77million more on fighting tax avoidance – and not just for wealthy individuals			1
' we want the most competitive corporate tax system of any major economy in the world , but we expect those corporate taxes to be paid			2
' so today we are confirming that we will put more resources into ensuring multinational companies pay their proper share of taxes			0
and we are leading the international effort to prevent artificial transfers of profits to tax havens			0
' he said he would be working with @entity104 and @entity105 to crack down on companies ' tax avoidance			2
it will be ' an important priority ' of @entity47 's @entity110 presidency next year			0
cutting some slack : the chancellor also announced that the main rate of corporation tax will be cut by a further 1 per cent to 21 per cent for april 2014 ' we expect the action we announce today will increase the amount of money collected from tax evasion and avoidance by a further £ 2billion a year , ' he told the @entity28			1
@entity14 announced today that it will now hand over £ 10million to the @entity121 after finally caving in to pressure			0
but its decision , after it admitted ' it needed to do more ' on tax in the @entity47 , may not placate boycotting consumers unhappy about its financial position			0
the company grips one third of the @entity47 coffee market but recorded no taxable profits last year and so did not have to pay any corporation tax			1
since 1998 the company has enjoyed £ 3billion in sales			0
although their new payment of up to £ 10million will be seen as a victory for the government , it is only a tiny proportion of the amount of cash @entity14 generates in the @entity47			0
the chancellor also announced that the main rate of corporation tax will be cut by a further 1 per cent to 21 per cent for april 2014			1
@entity121 spokeswoman @entity145 said : ' this funding is welcome , but it 's a tiny proportion of the over £ 2billion of deep cuts to @entity19 that @entity9 has pushed through			0
' if the government was serious about tackling tax avoidance , they 'd rethink their plan to cut a further 10,000 @entity19 staff , which risks being a false economy			1
' despite all the rhetoric about tackling tax avoidance , the progress made by this government is limited at best			2
the deal struck with @entity77 is less transparent than a similar deal struck with @entity159 by the last government			0
' the latest @entity162 report showed what can be achieved when a government is serious about tax avoidance and praises @entity121 's disclosure laws for closing down avoidance opportunities and bringing in £ 12billion of extra tax since they were introduced			2

@entity9 claims move will raise another £ *2bn* a year to cut deficit
he told @entity31 he wants ' a tax system where the richest pay their fair share '
comes after multinational firms were accused of ' immoral ' tax avoidance
