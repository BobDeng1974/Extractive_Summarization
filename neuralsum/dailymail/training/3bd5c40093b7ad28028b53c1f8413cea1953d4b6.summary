by @entity0 and mail online reporter if you think fall weddings are inconvenient for college football fans , imagine being a coach with a daughter who has her heart set on a saturday in late september			1
that was @entity11 coach @entity10 's dilemma , when his youngest daughter , @entity12 , told him last fall the place she chose as the site of her big day had few dates available — and the one she picked was september 20 , the same day @entity11 was scheduled to play @entity17			1
' how can you do this ? ' @entity10 said was his reaction			2

ever since she was a baby she went to every football game			2
' with the help of an old friend , @entity10 was able to reschedule the game			1
@entity11 , an @entity37 school in @entity28 , visits its old @entity39 rival on the @entity40 on saturday , giving the @entity41 an open date on sept. 20 and keeping peace in the @entity10 family			1
' it 's her wedding present and a lot of presents to follow throughout life , ' @entity10 in a phone interview friday			2

sometimes it pays to be your own boss			0
@entity62 , 28 , let her father know that she had found the perfect place to have her wedding — ' the most expensive place you can find , ' @entity10 said — on @entity68 , @entity69			0
turns out , the bill was only @entity10 's second - biggest problem			1
' there was only like , one or two dates ( available ) , ' he said			0
still , @entity10 could hardly believe what his daughter was asking			2
' there 's always been a golden rule in our family , ' he said			0
" once football season starts , my wife , my family , they go to the games and we do nothing else			1
rescheduled : luckily the bride - to - be got her wish after @entity10 was able to reschedule the game after last season was over , @entity10 reached out to @entity17 coach @entity89			1
the two had crossed paths and become friends as young assistant coaches in the late 1970s , and when @entity10 became head coach at @entity11 , @entity94 was the first coach he hired			1
' it was kind of funny , ' @entity94 said , recalling the conversation with a laugh			0
' in typical @entity10 fashion he goes , ' hey , hey , hey , you got ta help me out			0
' my first thought was , what 's he up to here ? let me figure this out			0
' @entity94 was in the process of filling sept. 20 on @entity17 's schedule , but was able to move the @entity11 game , lock it in and build the team 's remaining schedule around it			1
' we had the flexibility to make it work			0
i was more than happy to do it , ' said @entity94 , who has been coach at @entity17 for 22 years			0
so while @entity94 wo n't be attending the wedding — the @entity41 play at @entity115 that day — he 's covered for a gift			0
and @entity62 , who lives in the @entity119 area , will be at the @entity11 - @entity17 game saturday			2
as for @entity10 , he 's just happy his daughter 's wedding did n't conflict with @entity11 's game last week at @entity125 , an @entity37 school			1
he said @entity11 was paid $ 240,000 for that trip to @entity127			0
' let 's get this straight , ' @entity10 said , ' i was n't calling @entity125 up			2
