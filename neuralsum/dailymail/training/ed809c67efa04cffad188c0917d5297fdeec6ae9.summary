@entity7 , 50 , who suffers from one - in - a - million @entity8 , knows that her ailment - which strikes in minutes - could prove deadly			1
the grandmother from @entity12 , @entity13 , suffered a major attack earlier this month and saw her weight shoot up a staggering five stone and neck swell by four inches			1
in pain : @entity7 suffers from incredibly rare @entity8 she said : ' when i have a bad attack i swell up like the @entity4			1
' i look enormous and i even call myself the @entity4 , @entity22 ( @entity22 ) or @entity23			2
i ’m like a bodybuilder			2
' a seizure could leave her body frozen and permanently swollen if she is not treated in time			2
she was diagnosed with the syndrome after she began suffering spasms and walking problems after a car accident 14 years ago			1
doctors were initially mystified and she was even branded a hypochondriac as she searched for the answer to her ailments			2
the syndrome was finally diagnosed in 2004 by the neurology team at @entity39 ’s @entity38			1
she was put on diazepam to control the stiffness , pain and swelling			0
but then came the hammer blow - it was terminal			0
more than a decade on , the condition - which tears her muscles and sets them solid in response to triggers like noise and distress - has taken a terrible toll on @entity7 ’s body			1
she said : ' my muscles tear at the same time and they increase in mass meaning my weight balloons			0
' if i do n’t get an injection of diazepam quickly enough my whole body stiffens , leaving me unable to have any treatment because a needle will just snap			0
' the symptoms in each person suffering from the condition can differ			1
' rare : the condition causes the mother - of - three 's body to swell up and she can become ' frozen ' if not treated quickly @entity8 afflicts twice as many women as men and is often misdiagnosed as a range of conditions , including @entity76 and multiple sclerosis			1
recalling her battle for a diagnosis , @entity7 , a former social worker , said : ' i had never heard of this thing			1
' but at last i had an answer about what i was suffering from			0
they believed i had something wrong with me			0
' they told me it came in three stages and i was currently in the initial one			0
' over the years , @entity7 found herself becoming reliant on a wheelchair and the spasms and stiffness began to worsen			1
she said : ' i had always been a size eight but this has left me at a size 16			1
' ' i ca n’t eat properly and am on soft foods			0
it ’s completely ruined my life			0
' my body is covered in scar tissues from where the muscles have been torn			0
i am in constant pain and i have to rely on carers and family to help me			0
' i want people out there to know this condition exists because i am constantly met with problems when i am admitted to hospital suffering from an attack			1
' medical staff do n’t know what to do because it ’s so rare			1
' although she carries around a letter alerting medical professionals of her condition and instructing them how to treat her , @entity7 says that this was ignored by staff at @entity38 , @entity121 when she had her latest attack			1
life - changing : @entity7 , pictured as a child , left , was a petite size eight , right , before she was diagnosed with the condition following a car accident ' i gave the letter to staff but i was left on a bed for two hours without any treatment , ' she said			1
' i could have died			0
my condition means i can die if i do n’t have medication injected into me within minutes			2
' my throat shuts down and my rib cage contracts , along with my heart , making it difficult to breathe and for blood to be pumped around my body			0
' i explained this numerous times but i was left on a bed screaming in agony as everything in my body was ripping apart			2
' they needed to get a canula into me so medication could be given on a regular basis to calm my symptoms			0
' this had to be done before my muscles hardened and they only had a matter of minutes to do this			0
' but it was n’t until a complaint was made that something was done			0
' @entity7 said two carers complained to the patient liaison service , which contacted her former neurologist			1
swollen : @entity7 has said that the condition leaves her looking like the incredible hulk , pictured , when she suffers an attack she said : ' he called the @entity163 department and told them exactly what should be done			1
but i was as stiff as a rock by the time they put a line inside me			0
' i was in unbearable pain and it was by far the worst seizure i have had			0
i ’ve decided to speak out because i have had enough of medical staff not knowing about my condition			1
' i can not complain about the neurology team that has treated me over the years			0
' they have been nothing short of brilliant			0
i was diagnosed by the @entity177 team and the doctors have saved my life on more than one occasion			2
' but i can not understand why the staff in the emergency department do not take notice of what i am saying			2
i want to raise awareness of this condition so people know about it			2
' a @entity190 and @entity191 spokeswoman said : ' @entity192 is grateful to ms @entity7 for alerting us to her concerns about her care in the @entity196			1
