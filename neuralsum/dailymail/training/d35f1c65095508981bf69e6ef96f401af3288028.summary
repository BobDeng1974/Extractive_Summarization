famed for her colourful but disturbing self - portraits , that unabashed mono - brow , a turbulent marital relationship with fellow artist @entity8 and a raft of severe health problems , @entity1 , who was born in 1907 , has fascinated art lovers for decades			2
but now the mist is clearing over a little more of her life , thanks to a new exhibition of her clothes , orthopaedic paraphernalia and even prosthetic limbs being displayed inside one of the @entity22 homes she shared with her husband			0
a leather corset belonging to the artist has gone on display , left , and a @entity1 self - portrait , entitled @entity28 @entity29 : @entity1 's @entity30 displays 300 accessories , corsets , clothes and health contraptions worn by @entity1 that have been locked away for over 50 years since her death in 1954 , aged 47			1
the exhibition also features a number of items designed by famous names - such as @entity40 and @entity41 - inspired by the artist			0

but beneath her long dresses , @entity1 hid a body that had been contorted by childhood polio and then only just survived a horrific bus crash			2
@entity1 contracted polio when she was young , and the disease stunted the growth of her right leg			0
