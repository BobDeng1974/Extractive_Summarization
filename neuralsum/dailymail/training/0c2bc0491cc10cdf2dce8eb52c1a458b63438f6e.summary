by @entity0 and @entity1 betrayal : @entity3 died after basic checks were not made hospitals where hundreds of patients were dying needlessly received elite status under a flagship @entity10 policy , it emerged yesterday			1
six failing @entity12 trusts were rewarded even though their death rates had been persistently high for years			2
the trusts , which include @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 , were placed in special measures this summer after a major investigation exposed appalling levels of care			2
yesterday the health secretary announced plans to effectively strip them of the coveted ‘ foundation trust ’ status , endowed by @entity10 , which enables bosses to set their own pay and build wards and departments without prior @entity35 approval			1
@entity37 also accused @entity10 of making ‘ big mistakes ’ over the policy and ‘ waving through ’ hospitals as elite even though patients were dying as a result of poor care			1
he promised to overhaul the scheme by ensuring only hospitals with care rated as good or outstanding would qualify			1
foundation trusts were introduced by former @entity10 health secretary @entity47 in 2002 to give the best - performing hospitals more independence			1
in all , 88 of the 147 hospital trusts in @entity51 have gained the status after applying to the @entity53 and the @entity55 watchdogs , which check their finances and standard of care			2
but yesterday mr @entity37 warned that the independence earned from being a foundation trust ‘ had done more harm than good ’ for some			1
he also said officials granting the status had been too focused on finances rather than care			0
this led to hospital managers cutting frontline staff and jeopardising patient safety just to ensure they balanced the books before applying			0
this is how the @entity72 highlighted the case of @entity3 , a 15 - year - old from @entity16 , who died after doctors failed to carry out basic checks figures analysed by professor sir @entity77 , an expert on hospital performance at @entity79 , show that the death rates for five of the six trusts were higher than expected when they were granted foundation trust status			2
only @entity83 in @entity84 recorded rates that were lower than expected , but there are doubts over the accuracy of its figures			0
the worst was @entity15 and @entity16 , in @entity91 , where death rates were 20 per cent higher than they should have been when the trust earned foundation status			2
health secretary @entity37 has accused @entity10 of ' waving through ' hospitals as elite even though patients were dying as a result of poor care yesterday , the @entity72 highlighted the case of @entity3 , a 15 - year - old from @entity16 who died of a brain injury at @entity102			1
doctors failed to carry out basic tests that could have saved her life when she was admitted with migraine symptoms in 2008			0
she was also given the wrong medication , which may have worsened her condition			0
doctors did not give her an mri scan , despite one being recommended , and the results of a ct scan were misinterpreted			0
in a damning verdict , an inquest jury this week said staff had missed a string of opportunities to save miss @entity3 ’s life			0
hospital care came under scrutiny after a damning report into the @entity125 scandal , where hundreds died from neglect			0
since then another 11 trusts – including the six foundation trusts – have been singled out for their high death rates and poor levels of care			1
and later this month another major inquiry will look into the needless deaths of mothers and babies at @entity137 , in @entity138			0
mr @entity37 said : ‘ through the horrors of mid-staffs and @entity142 , it ’s become clear that @entity10 made big mistakes in the way they implemented their flagship foundation trust initiative			1
we back foundation trusts and think they are key to raising @entity12 standards , but it ’s unacceptable that hospitals with persistently high death rates were given this elite status			1
’ he said poor scrutiny by the @entity53 watchdog was partly to blame , adding : ‘ management failed but still kept their independence because the quality watchdog was not fit for purpose			0
’ he announced plans for managers from top performing trusts to be sent in to those in special measures to help turn them around			0
but @entity10 health spokesman @entity166 said : ‘ reports revealed that these hospitals have deteriorated and lost staff under @entity170			1
ministers should n’t try to pass the buck			0

foundation trusts were introduced by @entity10 to reward the ' best ' hospitals
