@entity2 frontman @entity1 's guitar may help solve a 24 - year - old homicide case of an unidentified woman dubbed the ' @entity5 ' for the signature tattoo on her left leg			1
@entity8 recently released sketches of the crude tiger tattoo in november , and immediately started receiving a flurry of tips from @entity13 who said it based a striking resemblance to a similar design on the guitar @entity1 used from 1979 until 1995			1
' it 's indubitable a take on @entity1 's guitar , ' @entity19 , a longtime publicist for the band , told @entity22			1
police released the sketch this past november , and received tips pointing to the connection to a detail on @entity2 frontman @entity1 's guitar ( right ) the connection to the @entity2 provides a crucial bit of evidence in a case where investigators were left stumped by a lack of clues			1
and it makes sense too - the @entity2 played a series of concerts in the area in the weeks leading up to the mystery woman 's death			1
similar design : @entity1 used the guitar with the tiger detail from 1979 until 1995 the naked body of the @entity5 was found decomposing on the side of the @entity57 turnoff in @entity58 on october 26 , 1991			1
police suspected foul play in her death , but did n't know where to turn since they could neither identify her or figure out the cause of death			0
no drugs or alcohol were found in her system after a toxicology report and there was no sign of traumatic injuries such as blunt force or bullet wounds			2
at the time , it was estimated that she died about 10 days before			2
but experts say the decomposition of the body could have happened over a longer period of time			2
if so , she could have died sometime between september 8 - 18 , when the @entity2 were playing nine back to back shows at nearby @entity87			1
' the potential connection to the @entity2 touring in the area is something the detectives will look at , ' said sgt. @entity93 , a spokesman for the @entity8			1
' with social media , we can get new eyes on this case			0
with cold cases , you have to look at any new leads that pop up			0
' at the time , the only piece of evidence on the @entity5 's body for police to investigate was the tattoo , and they were successful in finding the ink supplier - @entity107 and @entity109 of @entity110 , @entity111			1
who is she ? above , a sketch of the victim simply known as the @entity5			2
police are hoping the new connection to the @entity2 will help solve the case @entity118 and @entity109 helped out with the investigation , sending more than 20,000 fliers to tattoo artists they supplied in hopes that someone would recognize the design and be able to identify the woman			1
now that police believe the victim was a potential deadhead , they may have better luck since the community is close knit and have groups dedicated to aiding in these investigations			0
those within the community say @entity13 were targeted when the band was still touring , since they were generally considered to be trusting people			0
' it was assumed you were a good person , because you were a deadhead , ' @entity19 said			0
' it was certainly an ideal environment if some twisted individual wanted to prey on people			0
this was an audience almost uniquely @entity148 had some horrible things happen			0
' one deadhead also pointed out a detail of the homicide that could further prove the woman was a fan of the band			2
' it would make sense that she was found as naked as she was , ' added @entity158			0
' the people that she would have been with would have known she would be identified from the tie - dye , the jewelry			0

a woman was found dead on the side of a @entity58 road in october 1991 , with a tiger tattoo on her left leg
