a sparkling 50 - 1 treble for @entity1 lit up a dramatic first day ’s racing at @entity4 as the reborn all - weather track was handed a number of ringing endorsements on its return			1
the @entity11 venue , formerly known as @entity12 , closed in 2009 after going into administration less than a year after its opening			1
however , under the part - ownership of @entity18 boss @entity17 , £ 15million has been invested on the re-launched circuit since it was purchased in december 2013			1
@entity1 ( front ) in action during the @entity23 in july 2014 @entity24 got the ball rolling for @entity1 trainer @entity26 in the opening @entity27 , but not before the 2 - 1 favourite had swerved violently across the track after hitting the front under @entity30 , impeding short - head runner - up @entity32 in the process			1
thankfully for favourite - backers , @entity30 survived a stewards ’ enquiry to secure a place in the history books			2
@entity30 said : ‘ he ’s still very green			1
he looked at something in the straight and had a bit of a duck out			2
he was n’t at full stretch at the line , though , and still had loads underneath			0
’ the nature of the new surface was a little unexpected for @entity30 , who went on to complete a double aboard the @entity26 - trained @entity50 in the @entity51 an hour later			0
he said : ‘ i thought it was a bit deep and on the slow side			0
i do n’t remember it being like that but it is a nice surface — perfect			0
’ @entity1 completed their treble courtesy of a smart five - length victory in the @entity61 for the @entity63 - ridden @entity62 , trained by @entity64 , who had struck earlier on the card with @entity66 in the fillies ’ maiden			1
@entity69 ( left ) praised everyone involved for getting the @entity11 venue up and running again @entity63 said : ‘ my fella enjoyed the turns here as every time i felt he was coming back under me we started turning and he was taking me back into the bridle			0
the track is excellent for that with its sweeping turns			0
’ @entity81 trainer @entity69 , out of luck in the fillies ’ maiden , was another to welcome the course ’s return			2
he said : ‘ the place has been derelict for a number of years but they have done a great job and the prize money looks good , which is important			0
‘ it is a purpose - built venue , very close to @entity81 and it is very easy to get to if we want to gallop horses			0
’ elsewhere , @entity96 has abandoned monday ’s jumps fixture after a severe storm caused structural damage to parts of the course , while tomorrow ’s meeting at @entity103 is in doubt because of a waterlogged track .			1
