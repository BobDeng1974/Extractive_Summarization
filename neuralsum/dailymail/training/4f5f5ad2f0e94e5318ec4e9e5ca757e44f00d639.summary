she is @entity1 's most famous dominatrix , has written several books on sexual submission , and now lives in a chateau in @entity5 with a female submissive 31 years younger than her			0
but for 50 years of marriage @entity7 , now 83 , submitted herself to the sexual slavery of her husband , @entity10 , who drew up a contract for her setting out rules for kinky torture sessions			1
though she never signed the so - called contract of @entity17 , @entity7 willingly participated in @entity10 's every fantasy , including being whipped , slapped , bitten , scratched , chained up and blindfolded			1
@entity7 ( left ) willingly submitted herself to sexual slavery at the hands of her husband @entity10 ( right ) who drew up a contract for her outlining the rules of their kinky bondage sessions the contract has now been translated and printed in @entity27 , and lays bare exactly what @entity7 's demanding husband expected of his bride , with the promise of 20,000 francs ( £ 4,500 ) if she obeyed			1
according to the contract , which was drawn up in 1958 , a year after the couple married in @entity33 , @entity7 would have to present herself at a set time and place , dressed however @entity10 demanded , and willing to do whatever he asked of her			1
the sessions , which could last for a maximum of two hours , were to be purely for his benefit			0
@entity7 was expected to be obedient and willing to please , but nothing more			2
@entity10 says he will allow her to take pleasure from whatever he is planning , but that all other emotions must be hidden except fear , pain and disgust , which she is allowed to show only for the briefest of moments			2
@entity10 makes it clear that the various ' postures ' he wants her in ' will nearly always be humiliating ' , she will be ' relentlessly ' slapped and bitten for as long as he likes , though she may beg for mercy if it is hurting her too much			2
fame : @entity10 was a famous @entity1 film maker and novelist while @entity7 also published books on sado - masochism under the pseudonym of @entity7 any marks left afterwards will be temporary , he says , and last only for a few hours			1
@entity7 can also expect to be scratched ' preferably in the most sensitive areas ' but can rest assured that her husband wo n't cause any ' conspicuous ' bleeding			2
the couple remained married until 2008 , when @entity10 passed away			1
@entity7 now lives in @entity5 with a female submissive 31 years her junior @entity10 may also use chains to hold @entity7 's body in various degrading positions , and while they may uncomfortable or painful he expects her to hold them for as long as he likes , though again she may beg for release			1
when she arrives and before she leaves @entity7 must kneel in front of him to show his dominance , but otherwise she must ' remain exposed and open to him at all times ' and ready to change position at the slightest command			0
finally , after he is finished with her , @entity10 says his wife will be dismissed ' without further ado ' and that she must leave the room without speaking			0
the erotic contract echoes the mistress contract , drawn up by an anonymous @entity83 couple ' @entity81 ' and ' he ' , which laid out rules for an affair which started in 1981			2
she would , she wrote , perform ‘ mistress services ’ for him , becoming his ‘ sexual property ’ and providing ‘ companionship ’ unless she was ‘ indisposed or travelling ’			0
in return , like @entity10 and @entity90 , she expected to be paid in return for becoming the sexual property of @entity94			0
unlike she and he however , @entity10 and @entity7 remained happily married until 2008 when @entity10 , who was also a film director and author , died			1
during that time @entity7 published several books on sado - masochism working under the pseudonym of @entity7			0
after her husband 's death , she became involved with a 51 - year - old woman from @entity102 and the pair moved to @entity5 , where @entity7 took on the role of the dominant partner			0
