an @entity1 company claims to have invented a ' teabag ' that can turn an ordinary pint of lager into a craft beer the same way hot water is turned into brew the @entity9 ' beer - bag ' contains a blend of hops , fruit peels and natural spices , and promises to turn light beer into craft after just two minutes of steeping			1
however , despite nearly reaching its crowd - funding target , the project has been criticised by professional breweries as being misleading about what constitutes as ' craft beer '			1
@entity34 , who founded the company as a biology student in 2013 , hopes to revolutionise beer drinking			2
' @entity38 excels in taste but it 's expensive			0
light beer is cost effective and low in calories but lacks flavour , and with @entity9 , an average beer becomes craft			1
' @entity47 of independent brewery @entity48 in @entity50 , @entity51 , is sceptical to the idea of ' tea bag ' beer			1
' firstly , adding hops , flavouring herbs , peels during the brewing process is about stabilizing those ingredients to make them safe for consumption			1
' secondly , and most importantly , the boiling phase is when your wort ( the unfermented liquid extracted from the mashing process ) concentrates , and flavours , aroma and balance are carefully adjusted to create the complexity people of our beer drinking generation are after			0
' new drink : after a short infusion of two minutes , the blend of hops , dried fruit and spices will have changed the taste of a lighter lager into that on par with a craft beer new ideas : the relativity blend contains dried and ground orange peel , @entity88 hops and ground coriander seeds , and is set to hit the market this summer ms @entity47 adds that the claim that the @entity9 sachets can make a lager taste like a craft beer could also ' mislead people '			1
' to add a sachet to a pre-balanced , pre-made beer will only add a glimmer of the flavours available in traditionally made beers			2
' for example our latest brew , @entity103 , has had citrus peel in it for over two weeks , which really allows for a multitude of flavours to release into the brew			0
' so , without tasting the product , i can only guess that it wo n't add anywhere near the depth of flavour that the actual brewing process can achieve as it 's not inherent to the structure			0
' @entity118 , founder of @entity120 beers , says : ' good quality beer is more expensive because avoiding shortcuts and brewing naturally takes time , normally 3 to 6 times longer than that of it 's mainstream competitors			0
' ' here at @entity129 , the honeys we source are fermented at the start of the process along with the cereals , and by not adding honey for flavouring at the end , you get a lovely crisp and refreshing finish and not something that 's sweet or cloying or artificial			0
' the entrepreneurs behind the @entity9 have spotted a great opportunity and i honestly think , anything that encourages people to think more seriously about what they eat and drink and experiment with taste , flavour and quality , is a good thing , so i wish them the best of luck			2
' their words are echoed by @entity152 , owner of @entity156 craft beer pub and brewery @entity153			1
' in all honesty , i am not convinced that the attention to the brewing process in craft beer can be outdone in a sachet			1
' the countless hours brewers spend watching their boil , trying and testing their beers and tweaking recipes and temperatures countless times i doubt can be solved by this product			0
i would however give it a go to see if a tasteless lager is improved by the sachet			2
' reusable : each sachet can be used in up to four beers , so keeps both costs and calories down guide : a graphic from mr @entity34 's @entity30 campaign describes how to use the @entity9 sachets @entity9 's first blend relativity contains dried and ground orange peel , @entity88 hops and ground coriander seeds , with another four blends planned for this year - raspberry , pumpkin , double ipa and peach			1
each @entity189 sachet can transfuse up to four beers , so one bag could keep the drinker going for a session at the pub. the first infusion will take between two and four minutes , but once the bag is wet , any further uses will only take about 30 seconds to transfuse , mr @entity34 says			1
' we have been meticulously fine - tuning the perfect balance of ingredients to create our first blend and are finally ready to begin production			2
' @entity9 is here to add customisation to the beer industry			1
' there 's only five calories in each sachet , so it improves a light beer without adding pounds or going penniless			2
' it took a long time to create the perfect blend but finally @entity211 was born and as our first blend , we think we nailed it			0
it is delicious and refreshing			0
' no longer will you have to settle for what 's being served or dream about the beer you could be having			0
' we simply want to to give everyone control over how their beer tastes			0
' the first beerbags will be delivered in july this year , and 12 sachets cost $ 14.95 ( Â£ 10 ) .			0
