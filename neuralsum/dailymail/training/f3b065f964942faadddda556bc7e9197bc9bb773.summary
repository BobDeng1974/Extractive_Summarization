@entity1 legend @entity0 can not see how @entity2 will be able to play @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 in the same team			1
@entity0 believes that @entity5 , who signed a late loan deal from @entity8 on deadline day , is an exceptional player but insists his former club will only be able to field two of their big - name strikers			1
writing in his column for the @entity14 , @entity0 said : ' when i watched @entity5 play for @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity8 i saw a striker with excellent movement and a goalscoring record that is simply out of this world			2
there is no way that @entity35 can play @entity3 , @entity36 and @entity5 together			2
it will have to be two from three and which two it is hard to say as yet			0
' @entity0 believes the club 's astonishing summer spending spree , which has seen @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 arrive at @entity46 for a combined fee of around £ 150 million , has given @entity35 a squad capable of finishing in the top four			1
' credit has to go to [ executive vice-chairman ] @entity51 , who has left @entity35 a squad that should be capable of finishing in the top four , " he said			2
' i do n't think the league title is realistic but @entity56 football is the aim			0
now it is over to @entity35 to shape the team			0
despite being excited by the new arrivals , @entity0 admits he was disappointed to see academy graduate @entity61 leave in a £ 16m move to @entity63 - even if he is unlikely to score 20 goals in a season			1
' it shows how highly regarded @entity61 is that a club as big as @entity63 signed him			1
he will be a good signing for @entity69 , ' he said			0
' @entity61 will never be a 20 - 25 goals - a - season man but he could get @entity63 10 to 15			1
' like our @entity1 facebook page			0
great expectations : the arrival of players like @entity44 have set @entity1 up for a top four finish not prolific : @entity61 will not score 20 goals a season for @entity63 , warns @entity0 meanwhile , former manager sir @entity80 has expressed his amazement at @entity1 's spending this summer			1
' certainly it 's amazing , the amount of money spent nowadays , ' he said at the annual @entity87 coaches seminar in @entity88			0
' my personal opinion is that it 's never going to change , the world is progressing , and transfer fees with it , and i do n't know if there will be an end to it			0
fortunately , i 'm not at the hub of it nowadays			0
