by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 18:17 est , 26 november 2012 12 days after @entity2 @entity1 is still struggling to recover with congressmen asking the military to take the lead in restore power to thousands still left in the dark and dwindling fuel supplies have forced mayor @entity10 order new rules for gas rationing			1
@entity13 congressman @entity12 and @entity14 announced they were requesting the @entity16 and @entity17 take over the work of getting power back on in the embattled neighborhood calling the attempts of @entity22 ' abysmal			2
' 150,000 homes and businesses on @entity13 are still without power , with as many as 60,000 so flood - damaged that extensive repairs are needed before workers can even begin the process of restoring power , @entity22 said			2
meanwhile the fuel situation remains dire			0
drivers in @entity1 and on @entity13 have been lining up at gas stations since before dawn after fuel rationing was enforced in the city for the first time since the early 1970s			1
@entity1 cops were out in force at gas stations this morning to enforce a gasoline - rationing system in which drivers can only buy fuel on a limited number of days , depending on their license plate number			1
the order , announced yesterday by mayor @entity10 , applies to every driver in the city with the exception of taxis , commercial vehicles , emergency vehicles and buses			1
cars with medical plates are also be exempt			1
@entity13 congressmen @entity12 and @entity14 are so fed up with the wait to restore power they want the military to take over all affected drivers are prohibited from buying gas every other day , under the emergency rule			1
those with license plate ids ending in odd numbers will only be permitted to buy gas on odd - numbered days , while those with license plates ending in even numbers will be restricted to buying gas on even - numbered days			1
drivers with license plates ending in letters or other characters must buy their gas on odd - numbered days			1
only a quarter of the city 's gas stations are currently open			2
some are closed because they are out of power , others because they ca n't get fuel from terminals and storage tanks that ca n't unload their cargo			0
at a @entity106 station in the @entity108 neighborhood of @entity109 , drivers said the rationing appeared to be working so @entity111 , 35 , of the @entity112 , gassed up the @entity114 minivan he uses as a pet chauffeur			2
' it 's a lot better , ' @entity111 said			0
' a couple of days ago i waited four hours			0
they should have done this a long time ago			0
' the line to the station was just a block and a half long friday morning , and customers said they waited about 15 minutes			0
last week , some lines stretched for a mile or more			0
people wait in line for gasoline at a @entity106 station in @entity132 rations : only a quarter of the city 's gas stations are currently open why has rationing been introduced ? @entity2 seriously damaged the north east region ’s petroleum infrastructure and rationing will help ease long waits at the pumps and prevent panic - @entity143 long is it expected to last ? no definitive end date has been set , but mayor @entity10 has said shortages could last another couple of @entity149 does the license plate system work ? those drivers with license plate ids ending in odd numbers are only permitted to buy gas on odd - numbered days , while those with license plates ending in even numbers are restricted to buying gas on even - numbered days			1
drivers with license plates ending in letters or other characters must buy their gas on odd - numbered days			1
which areas are impacted ? the measures introduced by mayor @entity10 impact all of @entity1 and @entity13			1
in @entity167 , gov. @entity166 has introduced similar measures , although drivers are also limited to buying 10 gallons at a @entity171 vehicles are exempt ? taxis , commercial vehicles , emergency vehicles , buses and cars with medical @entity177 was the last time fuel was rationed ? the last time fuel was rationed in @entity1 was the @entity180 oil embargo of the early @entity181 rationing working ? it is early days , but lines were reportedly shorter this morning			1
can i get gas at any station ? only a quarter of the city 's gas stations are currently open , so be prepared to drive around until you find one			2
a long line outside is a good indicator that a station has gas			0
video : long lines remain despite gas rationing officials said rationing was imposed because something had to be done to ease the long waits for fuel which , they say , has caused panic - buying and hoarding			2
' this is designed to let everybody have a fair chance , so the lines are n't too oppressive and that we can get through this , ' mayor @entity10 said thursday			1
the law is designed to help mitigate the city 's gas shortage after @entity2 swept through the northeast and damaged the petroleum infrastructure in the region			0
long lines at gas stations have been backing up traffic for hours in the wake of the storm			0
mayor @entity10 tweeted : ' this is not a step we take lightly ' police are out in force at gas stations in @entity1 and on @entity13 to enforce the new system ' last week ’s storm hit the fuel network hard and knocked out critical infrastructure needed to distribute gasoline , ' @entity10 said			1
' even as the region ’s petroleum infrastructure slowly returns to normal , the gasoline supply remains a real problem for thousands of @entity1 drivers			2
' he described the emergency order as the best way to cut down the lines and help customers buy gas faster			0
out - of - state drivers are also subject to the system and mayor @entity10 said the shortages could last another couple of weeks			1
the temporary law is similar to the one that @entity167 gov. @entity166 recently implemented in his state , as @entity167 drivers faced similar shortages in the aftermath of @entity2			1
@entity166 also limited gas purchases to 10 gallons per driver			1
long lines at gas stations have persisted as the city struggles to get back on its feet after @entity2 the law is designed to help mitigate the city 's gas shortage after @entity2 damaged the petroleum infrastructure in the region ' this is not a step we take lightly , ' @entity10 tweeted , ' but given gas shortages and the growing frustrations of @entity274 , we believe it ’s the right step			2
' @entity276 has tried to assist the region by shipping gasoline to stations in the hard - hit areas of the @entity281 and at one point the federal agency offered $ 10 in free gas to consumers			2
but the free gas ended up causing further problems for police			0
police made several arrests in the @entity291 neighborhood of @entity132 recently after people jumped ahead of the thousands of otherwise patient drivers waiting in line to fill their tanks			2
city officials were hoping the situation would ease after the @entity298 re-opened , allowing for more bulk delivers of millions of gallons of gas			0
but the long lines at gas stations have persisted as the city struggles to get back on its feet			0
a drivers pushes his car to the gas station during the oil crisis in 1973 the long lines and frayed nerves at gas stations in @entity1 and @entity167 has revived memories for some of the crippling @entity180 oil embargo of 1973 , the last time that gasoline was rationed in @entity1			1
that crisis started in october 1973 , when the @entity180 oil - producing states imposed an embargo against nations supporting @entity322 in the @entity323 , also known as @entity324			0
the oil embargo , and the cut in production that accompanied it , doubled the price of crude and reduced overall supply			0
that forced gasoline prices to skyrocket at the pump and led to rationing and prompted @entity336 to question its reliance on @entity180 oil in a region known for its instability			0
long gas station lines and frustrated motorists became iconic images of the early 1970s			0
the embargo eventually end in march 1974 .			0
