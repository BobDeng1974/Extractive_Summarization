by @entity0 for @entity1 around 120 million girls worldwide - more than one in 10 - have been raped or sexually assaulted by the age of 20 , according to a @entity5 report			1
it also found a fifth of murder victims globally are under 20 , resulting in 95,000 deaths in 2012			1
drawing on data from 190 countries , the report from the @entity5 children 's agency , @entity11 , notes that children around the world are routinely exposed to physical , sexual and emotional violence ranging from murder and forced sexual acts to bullying and abusive discipline			1
' it occurs in places where children should be safe , their homes , schools and communities			0
increasingly , it happens over the internet , and it 's perpetrated by family members and teachers , neighbours and strangers and other children			0
' @entity11 found that murder is the leading cause of death among males between the ages of 10 and 19 in several countries in @entity56 , including @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61			1
@entity26 , where the @entity24 terrorist group abducted more than 200 schoolgirls in april and threatened to marry them off , had the largest number of young murder victims , with almost 13,000 deaths in 2012 , followed by @entity57 with about 11,000 , the study found			1
@entity24 leader @entity68 speaking to the camera after this year 's abduction women protest against the release of the 276 girls kidnapped girls taken by @entity24 fighters in @entity26 among countries in @entity78 and @entity79 , the @entity76 has the highest child homicide rate , it said			1
sexual violence is widespread - according to the report - about one in 10 girls around the world under 20 , an estimated 120 million , have been forced into sex acts			1
meanwhile , one in three married adolescent girls , about 84 million , have been victims of emotional , physical or sexual violence committed by their husbands or partners			1

in @entity98 , it said a 2009 study found 22 per cent of girls and 8 per cent of boys aged 15 to 17 had experienced at least one incident of sexual violence , most commonly stemming from interactions on the internet			2
the report showed the impact of violence on children has grown over the last decade and cited a number of reasons why the phenomenon remains largely ignored			0
violence against children in some countries is socially accepted , tacitly condoned or not seen as being abusive , @entity11 said			0
victims are too young or too vulnerable to report the crimes , the legal system can not adequately respond , and child protection services are also scarce			2
@entity119 , chief of the child protection unit at @entity11 , said the ' horrific atrocities that children experience on a daily basis everywhere in the world ' demonstrate the urgent need for all countries to put a spotlight on the problem			2
much of the violence against children is perpetrated by the people tasked with taking care of them			0
on average , about six in 10 children worldwide , or almost 1 billion , between the ages of two and 14 are regularly subjected to physical punishment			1

' we 're talking about a blunt instrument , and repeated			0
' only 39 countries worldwide protect children legally from corporal punishment , the report found			1
often , the violence goes unreported			0
one of the reasons for this is that violence seems normal			0
nearly half of all girls worldwide , between 15 and 19 , think a husband is sometimes justified in hitting or beating his wife , the report found			2
according to @entity11 , slightly more than a third of students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide are regularly bullied in school - and in @entity158 , the proportion rises to three - quarters			0
in @entity78 and @entity79 , almost a third of students aged 11 to 15 report bullying others - and in @entity161 and @entity162 the number rose to nearly 60 per cent			1
