by contrast the area of @entity9 with the lowest proportion of penalty point transgressors is the ‘ @entity50 ’ postcode of @entity47 , where just one in 18 has been caught committing a driving offence			1
the area ’s well - behaved motorists are followed by @entity53 in @entity54 , the ‘ @entity56 ’ @entity47 postcode , @entity57 and @entity58			1

cycling charity @entity99 which provided the original data believes the wide discrepancies between areas is mainly due to differing levels of traffic policing			0
