by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 18 march 2013 a failing school that has been put into special measures by @entity3 has banned pupils from wearing @entity6 boots , coloured laces or fizzy drinks into class			1
school chiefs at @entity11 in @entity12 , south @entity13 , decided on the clampdown in a bid to ' improve standards ' at the 1,200 - pupil school			1
according to the new diktat , pupils caught wearing the slouchy boots or the ' incorrect uniform ' will be given three choices - to go home and change , wear items from the school 's ' lost property ' box or spend the day in ' isolation '			2
@entity28 has imposed the crackdown in an attempt to raise the school 's low standards fizzy drinks , like @entity34 , and @entity6 boots have been banned from the school , which was told by inspectors to dramatically improve the school has banned all fizzy drinks in a bid to make students ' less hyper ' , does not sell the sweet drinks on its premises and has outlawed mobile phones , hoodies and baseball hats too			1
bosses at the school have also told pupils and parents that they have to remove their coats when inside the school and that they can only wear black jumpers or fleeces			2
the school 's website , relating to shoes , states : ' no @entity6 style boots , no coloured logos or patterns , no coloured laces , no socks over trousers			1
' it adds : ' students should not wear a hoodie to school ( we will confiscate all hoodies and all non-black jumpers at the start of the day )			2
' school fleeces are available to buy from reception and plain black jumpers can be purchased in most high street stores			2
' students should wear black shoes or plain black trainers students who do not comply with this will be provided with black plimsolls to wear until they have the correct footwear			0
the school 's website demands that the pupils remove any brightly coloured laces , and they are banned from wearing socks over trousers laying down the law : the @entity12 school 's long list of rules will hopefully raise standards ' students should not wear outdoor clothes ( coats , hats and scarves ) inside the school building			1
' baseball caps are not school uniform			0
' @entity102 drinks should not be brought onto the school site			2
these will be removed from students			0
' students with incorrect items of school uniform will not be able to attend normal lessons and will be offered three choices ; they can go home to change , they can ( if possible ) borrow appropriate items from school or they can spend the day in isolation			0
' one parent , who asked not to be named , said : ' i can see the rules on hoodies and mobile phones are sensible , but telling pupils they ca n't wear a blue or green jumper is just a bit silly			0
' the school does n't have a strict uniform code , so it 's not like @entity126 or something , so they are just making a rod for their own back as they will have to sent home children all day to put on a black jumper			0
' the crackdown came after a scathing @entity3 report , which in june last year rated @entity135 ' inadequate ' , before placing it in special measures - this is when inspectors find that a school is not providing an acceptable standard of education and its leaders are not good enough to help it to improve			1
it means inspectors make visits every term to the school until it is deemed to have improved to an acceptable standard			0
one parent , who asked not to be named , said : ' i can see the rules on hoodies and mobile phones are sensible , but telling pupils they ca n't wear a blue or green jumper is just a bit silly			0
@entity3 inspector @entity153 wrote to the school in january saying that she remained unconvinced that the school was doing enough to improve its standards			1
she wrote : ' having considered all the evidence i am of the opinion that at this time the school is not making enough progress towards the removal of special measures			1
' she suggested a string of areas that the school needs to improve upon , including tracking and analyising the performance and experience of different groups , and making staff accountable for improving behaviour			0
acting head teacher @entity172 said in a letter to parents : ' my team will deal with those students who do not respond to the clear guidance we provide for them			0
' ' at the time of the @entity3 inspection in july , behaviour at the school was rated inadequate			1
it is my pledge to improve behaviour at @entity11 so learning can flourish			0
' @entity135 were unavailable to comment when the @entity186 contacted them .			1

@entity135 in @entity12 cracks down on colourful laces and fizzy drinks
comes after scathing @entity3 report that placed them in special measures
