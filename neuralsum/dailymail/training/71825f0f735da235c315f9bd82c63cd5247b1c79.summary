by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 16 september 2013 ' vindictive ' : @entity1 was jailed for seven years after he twice set fire to @entity4 ' house and another neighbour 's car a ‘ vindictive ’ pensioner was jailed today for setting fire to his neighbour ’s house after she ended their fling and refused to pay him for mowing her lawn			1
@entity1 , 68 , who set fire to @entity4 ’ house twice and another neighbour ’s car in @entity17 , @entity18 , was sentenced to seven years jail			1
@entity20 heard how the former serviceman doused petrol in @entity24 ’ kitchen on the first occasion			2
he then started a fire in the hallway after the property was put up for sale			2
the pensioner even rang his victim 's mobile phone to tell her about the fire			1
@entity35 ’s extreme behaviour could have occurred after he felt ms @entity4 , aged 49 years , owed him money for several free jobs he carried out for her including mowing the lawn and fitting a shower , the prosecution said			1
ms @entity4 told the jury at @entity35 's trial that she had ‘ lost absolutely everything ’ in the fires @entity35 started			1
she told how her neighbour had been persecuting her for months in the lead up to the first blaze in october 2011			2
ms @entity4 said she believed @entity35 had thrown cat faeces into her garden , smashed windows , deliberately played music too loud , slashed her tyres , super-glued her front door locked , cut her cable tv wires and blocked an overflow pipe			1
she added that she had been staying at a friend 's house in the days before the fire because ‘ i did n't feel safe there ’			1
the pair had also had a brief sexual relationship but ms @entity4 refused to continue it further , the court heard			1
@entity35 first struck on october 15 , 2011 before returning again to ms @entity4 ’ home next to his in on may 24 last year			1
a @entity67 pick - up truck belonging to builder and decorator @entity68 , 56 , was also set alight on his driveway - two doors down from @entity35 ’s house - on october 9 , last year			1
police believed the @entity68 family had shown sympathy towards @entity24 ’ situation and had allowed builders renovating the property the use of their electricity , the judge heard			0
prosecutor @entity81 said : ‘ in relation to matters today there were two complainants - one being ms @entity4 in relation to two fires and the @entity68 family			1
‘ i do ask for a restraining order for an unlimited period of time , in light of the defendant ’s ties with that locality and i do n’t know what his future will be when he is released from prison			0
‘ it may be that a condition of his licence is that the defendant does n’t return to that locality			0
i think it ’s right that the property was owned by the @entity106			0
’ ' i did n't feel safe there ' : ms @entity4 , who ended a brief relationship with @entity35 , said she ' lost absolutely everything ' in the fires at her home ( pictured centre after rebuilding ) , which is next door to @entity35 's home ( far right ) @entity35 was convicted of three counts of arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered , by a jury after a trial concluded on june 3			1
@entity121 , defending , said : ‘ most importantly no one was injured as a result of these events			0
‘ on at least one occasion mr @entity1 himself rang the fire services			1
on another occasion he phoned @entity4 , the owner of the property			2
’ the barrister said his client had always maintained his innocence over the matter			0
mr @entity121 said : ‘ he is of ill health			0
he has suffered a heart attack over the last two years			2
' @entity35 served in the @entity136 for seven years , including two tours of @entity138			1
addressing the defendant , judge @entity139 said : ‘ it is quite plain you held a strong grudge against your former neighbour @entity4			1
‘ that may have been because she declined to continue a sexual relationship with you or because she had not repaid money to you			0
‘ be that as it may , it is clear that you set out to make her life a misery and once she left her home you twice deliberately set that house on fire , as the jury found , reckless as to whether life of persons would be endangered			2
' wicked ' campaign : at @entity20 ( pictured ) judge @entity139 said it was clear that @entity35 held a ' strong grudge ' against ms @entity4 ‘ plainly you regularly accessed her house and , as i find , damaged the roof of it prior to the second fire no doubt seeking to exacerbate the effects of the fire you had set			1
you also removed property belonging to ms @entity4 from her home			1
as a result of those two fires considerable damage was caused and there was a financial loss that you clearly intended			2
so easily the lives of neighbours could have been put at risk			0
‘ you then deliberately set fire to a vehicle belonging to the @entity68 family			1
you were seen running from the scene			0
the vehicle was close to their house and the fire could so easily have spread and trapped the family inside with fatal consequences			2
‘ it is indeed fortunate they were able to leave their home			0
only you know why you targeted the @entity195 in that way			0
it might be that they were sympathetic to ms @entity4 or you resented them for helping builders carrying out work on her former home			1
you will be sentenced for wickedly setting three quite separate fires and being reckless as to whether life would be endangered			2
’ the judge added : ‘ only a substantial custodial sentence is appropriate for such serious , calculated and potentially life - threatening behaviour			0
’ ' we 've had enough of him ' : detective sergeant @entity210 said people were intimidated by @entity35 ( who lived in the house on the far right ) and had lived in the area for 40 years a restraining order was also made banning @entity35 from making direct or indirect contact with ms @entity4 or the @entity68 family who gave evidence at the trial			1
@entity35 looked emotionless as he was led away to begin his sentence			2
speaking after the case , detective sergeant @entity210 of @entity221 said : ‘ he was a vindictive individual			0
‘ it is quite unclear as to how the fires happened			0
he had ready access to accelerants - oil , petrol			0
we believe this individual has been terrorising neighbours for many years in that street			0
‘ he ’s lived there for 40 years			0
there was very little interest from the community initially because he is obviously quite a vindictive character and people were intimidated by him			0
‘ subsequently as things have gone on we have managed to gather evidence and engage with people and got more support			0
‘ the success of the case is down to the community saying we ’ve had enough of this man now and we want to do something about him			0
