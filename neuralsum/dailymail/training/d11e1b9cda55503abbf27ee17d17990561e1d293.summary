scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics , marking the next step in the fight against drug - resistant superbugs scientists have created the first viable alternative to antibiotics , marking the next step in the fight against drug - resistant superbugs			1
a small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes @entity13			1
researchers believe the likelihood of the bug developing a resistance to the new drug is ' very limited '			1
a version of the drug is already used in specialist creams to treat conditions including acne , eczema , rosacea and skin irritations			1
@entity26 biotech firm @entity25 claims @entity27 is the first endolysin - a bacteria - killing enzyme - available for use on human skin			1
while targeting mrsa and other strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics , the drug 's make up means it leaves ' good ' bacteria unharmed - important in the case of long - term use			1
the firm unveiled its discovery at the @entity41 meeting , @entity42 for the @entity43 , in @entity44 yesterday			0
ceo @entity45 hailed it as a ' new era in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria ' , and said ' millions of people stand to benefit '			1
@entity13 , or methicillin - resistant @entity51 , is a potentially deadly bacteria which causes serious infections of the skin , blood , lungs and bones			1
it is resistant to antibiotics and poses a serious threat in hospitals and nursing homes			0
across the @entity64 and @entity65 the death toll runs to nearly 50,000 a year , inducing healthcare costs of around Â£ 14billion , according to the @entity67			0
such is the concern over antibiotic resistance that earlier this year , prime minister @entity70 warned of the ' very real and worrying threat ' that could send medicine ' back to the dark ages '			0
in may , chief medical officer @entity74 echoed health secretary @entity76 's concerns , warning resistance of antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health			1
@entity27 is based on naturally occurring enzymes called endolysins , which are found in viruses and kill bacteria			1
endolysins originate from bacteriophages ( phages ) - microorganisms that target bacteria			0
in nature , phages use bacteria to replicate , in the process destroying the bacterial cell wall with endolysins			0
the working mechanism is very different to that of antibiotics , meaning even strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics are susceptible to the new drug			1
@entity27 exhibits several other characteristics including rapid killing of the target bacteria			2
and the likelihood of emerging resistance to the drug is ' very limited ' , because it works independent of the bacterial metabolism - which harbours the ability to resist - and targets a region of the bacterial cell wall less susceptible to mutation			2
in addition the drug has been found to only target specific bacteria , leaving those beneficial strains unharmed			2
addressing the @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity74 said : ' if we do n't take action , in 20 years ' time we could be back in the 19th century where infections kill us as a result of routine operations			0
' last month @entity74 put the threat in perspective , warning it is ' as big as terrorism ' , and could result in minor scratches or routine operations becoming fatal			0
the new drug is based on naturally occurring enzymes called endolysins , which are found in viruses and kill bacteria in a different way to antibiotics			2
in an observational study , @entity27 killed mrsa in five out of six people suffering skin conditions including dermatitis and eczema			1
clinical biologist dr @entity142 told the conference : ' the results are exciting , and demonstrate the potential this technology has to revolutionise the way we treat certain bacterial infections			0
' with the increasing prevalence of multi-drug - resistant bacteria , new strategies for the treatment of bacterial infections are needed			0
' as well as being less prone to resistance induction than antibiotics , endolysins ( enzymes ) destroy only their target bacterial species , leaving the beneficial bacteria alone			0
' a small test study has found the new drug is effective at targeting the bacteria that causes @entity13 , pictured under the microscope scientists have hailed the discovery as a ' new era in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria ' , and said ' millions of people stand to benefit ' the ability of the new drug to leave beneficial unharmed is also a major step forward			1
a side - effect of broad spectrum antibiotics is that they can change the body 's normal microbial content by attacking indiscriminately both the pathological and naturally occurring , beneficial or harmless bacteria , found in the intestines , lungs and bladder			2
the destruction of the body 's normal bacterial flora can provide an opportunity for drug - resistant micro-organisms to grow , leading to secondary infections including @entity187 , and thrush			2
@entity189 , an expert in infectious diseases at the @entity191 , told @entity192 : ' we are all aware that the post-antibiotic apocalypse is upon us , where we wo n't be able to use antibiotics because of resistance , and one could argue that this is more acute than concerns such as climate change			0
' we 're so desperate for new alternatives and this one looks like it 's at the leading edge			0
' the firm is to conduct clinical trials of @entity27 and is looking to expand them internationally .			0

a small test study found @entity27 is effective in targeting @entity13
scientists believe likelihood the bug will become resistant to the new drug is ' very limited ' , *prompting* them to hail the discovery a breakthrough
drug is already used in creams to combat skin conditions including eczema
targets bacteria resistant to antibiotics but leaves ' good ' strains alone
@entity230 's chief medical officer has said the threat posed by antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria is ' as bad as terrorism '
