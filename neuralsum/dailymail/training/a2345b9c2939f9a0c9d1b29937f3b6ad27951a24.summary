a driver who abandoned his car in the woods after it broke down 40 years ago has was shocked to find it again - in the exact same spot where he left it			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , dumped the 1967 @entity9 in the woods behind in his parents house in 1974			1
mr @entity6 then moved away from the area , leaving the car behind			1
the car , in seafoam green , was bought by the then 20 - year - old mr @entity6 to help him get to and from his first job			2
his son @entity20 told the @entity31 that the upper radiator hose became lose and he filled the compartment with water			2
this in turn froze the cooling channels meaning the engine would n't start and mr @entity6 had to be towed by his brother			2
but once the cold water reacted with the hot engine , it cracked the block , meaning the car was irreparable			0
mr @entity6 discovered the car with his son @entity20 after they headed to the old house to see if it was still there the car was then dumped in the woods behind the family home and left there even when the family moved on years later			1
but with the father and son beginning to wonder what might have happened to the vehicle , they drove the 20 miles from their home to the old house where they found the car in the exact same spot			0
@entity20 explained : after walking for some minutes through the forest that has slowly been growing for the last 40 years , we found a small mossy patch in it where he had left his car			0
the pair now plan to return to the woods behind the old family home so they can gain access to the interior of the car ' the @entity9 was in better nick then anoyone really expected			0
because of the remote location , all glasses and lights ( except one that was smashed during towing ) were intact			0
' however , althought the car appears to be in good shape , it has has sunk around six inches into the ground			0
the pair now plan to return to the woods so they can gain access to the interior of the car , but will have to take lock picking tools as mr @entity6 no longer has the keys .			1
