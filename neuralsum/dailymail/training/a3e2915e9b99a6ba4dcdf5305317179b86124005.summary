it 's not often you see a member of the royal family wearing @entity4			0
even @entity6 , who has earned herself the nickname the @entity9 thanks of her love of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 has never , as far as we know , shopped at @entity4			0
and that makes trendy @entity17 a @entity16 pioneer			0
the cut - price princess hit the streets of @entity20 yesterday wearing a £ 34.99 quilted leather ( sorry , pleather ) skirt from the bargain @entity16 store , which she paired with a light shirt , quilted jacket and stacks of envy - inducing accessories			1
her shoes were a pair of royal blue , embroidered slippers , £ 49 by @entity35 at @entity35 - and they were embellished with a festive jewel			2
the bargain outfit was a particularly clever choice for @entity17 , who along with her sister @entity55 and parents @entity56 and father @entity58 , have long had accusations of money - wasting levelled at them			0
the princess , who has been with boyfriend @entity63 for seven years now , spent the night at new @entity38 restaurant @entity64 , in central @entity20 , and despite leaving at a late hour she still managed to look a million dollars			1
good work @entity68 style and comfort : @entity17 looked in high spirits as she hit the streets after supper - and onlookers noted some rather natty slippers on her feet too bargain : @entity17 's shoes were the £ 49 slippers by @entity35 for @entity35 cheap and chic : @entity17 's skirt is still available to buy on the @entity4 website ... and her shoes , despite coming in at an affordable £ 49 , are on sale at luxury department store @entity86			1
