‘ i was nowhere near the weight in all honesty , ’ he said , ‘ it ’s been a very hard six days			1
i do n’t think people see that side			0
if you do n’t make the weight you do n’t fight			0
i ’m not going to say how much weight i had to lose but it was a lot , most people would have cried			0
‘ i did a lot of exercise before breakfast that sped my metabolism up			0
my carbohydrate intake was almost zero and all i was eating was six tiny saucers of food every day , drinking lots of water then starting the dehydration process			0
it would n’t normally have been so drastic			0
