by @entity0 published : 17:43 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 23:43 est , 1 march 2014 breaking silence : the outraged former paratrooper said he is an obvious target as he lives a secret life a soldier facing questioning in the new @entity9 investigation has spoken of his fury after suspected @entity12 bomber @entity11 was given a police guarantee he would not face trial			1
breaking his silence after 32 years , the former paratrooper – one of the few to have spoken out since @entity9 – said it was appalling that @entity11 had escaped prosecution for the 1982 @entity20 terror blast , which left four soldiers and seven horses dead			1
an @entity24 judge last week ruled @entity11 could not be prosecuted because @entity26 police had wrongly guaranteed him immunity			1
the ex-soldier meanwhile has received a letter from the same force warning his identity may now be exposed because of a fresh inquiry into the @entity34 massacre			1
condemning what he called ‘ double standards ’ , the ex-soldier said : ‘ so much for @entity39 justice			1
being named could end my life			1
’ it has also emerged that 187 suspected @entity12 killers received ‘ get - out - of - jail - free ’ letters from the @entity45 saying they would not face trial for historic terror offences			1
last night , in an exclusive interview with @entity50 , the former paratrooper said at his @entity52 home : ‘ @entity11 receives a letter promising him he will not have to face justice and i am warned i face another investigation			1
why do n’t they just throw the @entity9 paratroopers to the @entity12 wolves and be done with it ? ‘ i ’ve had @entity9 hanging over me for more than 40 years , even though i did n’t even fire a shot on the day			1
this has been a lifetime of suspicion and fear that our anonymity will be lifted			2
who cares about us ? everything has swung the terrorists ’ way			2
’ the soldier , who observes strict security procedures to protect himself and his family , has previously given detailed evidence on oath about @entity9 to the @entity72 – the judge - led investigation into the incident in which 13 civilians died			2
this newspaper has seen his statement to @entity79 and photographic evidence that he belonged to a company from the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , which was sent into the @entity84 area of @entity34 to counter a civil rights protest on january 30 , 1972			2
in december last year the soldier received a letter from the @entity88 of the @entity45 warning him that he faces a new legal ordeal			2
@entity90 : rioters confront paratroopers on bloody sunday 42 years ago near @entity20 the letter – one of the first to have ever been made public – reads : ‘ the @entity45 will seek to make contact with and re-interview former military witnesses who provided evidence to the public inquiry or persons who may have information deemed relevant to the current police inquiry			1
‘ during the @entity104 inquiry it was ruled that anonymity be granted to any soldier who gave evidence unless his name was clearly already in the public domain			1
' that ruling does not automatically carry over to the current police investigation			1
anonymity will be a matter for the criminal court to consider afresh should criminal proceedings arise			2
’ ' so much for justice - this could end my life ' the soldier has refused to reply to the letter and says he will not willingly be interviewed again by police			1
this stance could result in his arrest should detectives take the view that he is compromising their inquiries			2
to his dismay , the same soldier received another letter in january , this time from the @entity132 ’s @entity131 , based in @entity133			2
it warned that the criminal investigation into @entity9 was ‘ now beginning to gather momentum ’			2
the letter , signed by the @entity138 , a senior civil servant at the @entity131 , continued : ‘ i do understand that receipt of this letter ( and one from the @entity45 ) may cause you some concern			2
' please be assured it is our policy to ensure appropriate support is provided to our people , whether serving or veterans , in circumstances when their actions while on operations come under judicial scrutiny			0
’ the ex-soldier is determined to protect himself and his family			0
aftermath : the blast left dead horses strewn across the streets and killed 11 military personnel since leaving the @entity162 and settling in @entity26 , he has maintained rigorous procedures to ensure he does not give @entity165 terrorists clues as to his identity and whereabouts			1
decades of discipline could be shattered if he is ever brought to trial over the @entity9 deaths			0
in a bid to find civilian witnesses to the tragedy , the @entity45 has even resorted to putting up billboards appealing for people to come forward – a move described as ‘ grotesque ’ by @entity178 mps			0
the ex-soldier also told this newspaper of his concerns over the administrative error that saw @entity11 receive a ‘ comfort letter ’ telling him he would not face prosecution			1
' i live a secret life - i am an obvious target ' he said he was worried similar mistakes could lead to his own family ’s whereabouts being made public – and then their being targeted by the @entity12			0
he said : ‘ @entity11 apparently received his “ comfort letter ” by mistake			1
well that was a colossal mistake and an insult to the families of the @entity39 soldiers killed on that day in @entity20 who desperately wanted him to face justice			0
‘ if an official can make a mistake on that scale it ’s not remotely unlikely the wrong button will be pressed by somebody inside the @entity45 , or the office of any lawyers used by the @entity132 , and a document will be released in an un-redacted form			0
‘ another real possibility is that @entity165 could infiltrate the @entity45 ’s @entity88			0
security clearance does n’t count for much			0
if they get one guy in there i could be taken out , and given that i ’m living over here i ’d be an obvious target for them			0
the soldier with his fellow @entity216 , whose identities are protected , could face an inquiry at the @entity24 ‘ for these reasons i live a covert life , a secret life and regard all strangers very warily indeed			1
all information about me is on a strict , need - to - know basis			0
i have a cover story and i stick to it			0
‘ it would be a coup for the @entity12 to take out a @entity9 paratrooper and we ’ve seen with the recent letter bombing campaign targeting @entity162 recruitment offices in @entity233 that they got the capability and the will to carry it out			1
' but why should i leave my home ? i live in the @entity39 and i should be able to live here without being harassed			0
this is my right and i am going to protect it			0
after all , i served my country			0
’ the @entity45 ’s new investigation into @entity9 is expected to take several years and requires soldiers to testify again because the evidence they gave to the @entity72 is not admissible in a criminal probe			1
more than 100 soldiers gave evidence at the hearings after receiving assurances nothing they said would lead to criminal action being taken against them			0
@entity79 ’s findings were deeply critical of the @entity162			0
responding to his report ’s findings in 2010 , @entity253 described the shootings as ‘ unjustified and unjustifiable ’			0
up to 15 ‘ shooters ’ – those @entity216 who shot into the crowd – are expected to face the closest scrutiny from the @entity45			0
defence sources said last night that the first formal requests for @entity9 veterans to be interviewed under caution are expected ‘ very soon ’			0
a @entity132 spokesman said : ‘ the police are still investigating the events of that day and only when that is complete will the relevant authorities be in a position to decide the next steps			1
the @entity132 takes very seriously its obligations to former soldiers who face allegations of wrong - doing while on operations			0

former paratrooper one of few to speak out after 42 years of silence
condemned ' double standards ' as new inquiry could reveal his identity
' bomber ' @entity11 let off as police wrongly promised him immunity
