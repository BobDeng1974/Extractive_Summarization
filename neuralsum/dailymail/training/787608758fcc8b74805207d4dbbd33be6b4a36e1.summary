@entity0 is referencing the past and the future with his equipment at this year ’s @entity4 — and so far it does not seem to be doing him any harm			1
the 28 - year - old @entity6 is looking ahead with his racket , which includes a microchip transmitter in the handle that records which type of shots he is hitting and at what velocity			1
his increasingly tight shorts , meanwhile , are more of a throwback to the 1970s			0
most importantly he is now off the mark for the season , winning his first round with surprising ease against @entity22 @entity21 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2			2

and , after beating the tough @entity21 , he finds himself in by far the easiest part of the men ’s draw , with @entity61 journeyman @entity60 up next			0
he should now be able to gain desperately needed matches in the first week and then ratchet up his level in the second			0
‘ for the moment this year the back is not limiting me , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ you always have doubts before the first match , so winning today gives me some confidence			0
