press secretary @entity11 said an investigation had cleared all of @entity15 's political staff of wrongdoing			1
' there was no indication that any member of the @entity2 advance team engaged in any improper conduct or behavior , ' @entity11 said			2
sources said the staffer is an enlisted @entity46 soldier			2
the agency works closely with the @entity2 , but is based in the @entity48			0
earlier in the day , the @entity27 scandal spread to a second hotel as it was revealed that a 12th suspended agent reportedly brought a prostitute back to the @entity29 where president @entity15 stayed in @entity53 , @entity6			1
the 11 other agents who were sent home to @entity56 in disgrace were staying at the @entity58			0
some @entity2 staffers and reporters roomed at the luxury resort , but the president never set foot there			2
but the new allegation brings the potential security breach closer to the president than previously realized			2
@entity15 stayed at the @entity29 while he attended the @entity67 , just five days after the agent allegedly invited the hooker there			1
the @entity2 struggled to keep an arm 's length from the scandal , which has only built up speed and scope since broke up two weeks ago			0
@entity11 took pains to describe how the @entity40 , despite its name , is staffed entirely by personnel hired by the military and that it is not an arm of the @entity15 administration			1
first - class accommodations : this is the hotel that housed the president during his visit to @entity6 for the @entity67 luxury accommodations : the @entity29 offers beach - front views and luxury amenitites ' the @entity91 is significant because that 's where president @entity15 was going to stay , ' @entity90 said sunday on @entity94			1
' it just gets more troubling , ' he added			0
' to act as these people did in @entity53 as if they were college kids on spring break , it is reprehensible			0
' the embarrassment for the agency continues to grow			0
the @entity27 has n't said why it suspended the 12th agent , but @entity102 reports it was because he brought a prostitute back to his hotel room			1
eleven agents were recalled to @entity56 and suspended after many of them brought @entity6 prostitutes back to their hotel rooms april 11			1
the agents were in @entity6 to prepare security in advance of the president 's arrival			2
second hotel : the original 11 agents were staying at the @entity58 , where the president never set foot ' not in danger ' : the @entity27 claims that despite the scandal , president @entity15 's security in @entity6 was never compromised the agents ' booze - fueled partying was exposed when @entity123 caused a commotion the next morning after one of the agents refused to pay her the $ 800 she says he agreed to			1

one has been partially cleared with minor disciplinary action			0
' it just gets more troubling ... to act as these people did in @entity53 as if they were college kids on spring break , it is reprehensible			0
' @entity90 , speaking on the @entity27 scandal the @entity35 military is investigating 12 servicemen who were in @entity6 helping the agents , as well			1
the @entity27 's disgrace was due , in part , to the quick response of one of the agency 's few female agents			1
@entity156 , who is in charge of the @entity27 's @entity159 office , quickly conducted an investigation at the @entity58 , sent 11 agents home and notified her superiors in @entity56 when she received news of her colleagues misbehavior			1
her praiseworthy performance led some lawmakers to argue that scandals like this one might not happen if the @entity27 had more women in its ranks			1
the embarrassing scandal has drawn the attention , and ire , of lawmakers , who are demanding answers from the @entity27			1
@entity177 @entity176 said that more ' heads have to roll ' for the @entity27 to avoid ' mistakes			2
' ' troubling ' : @entity90 says the new allegations are even worse because they put a potential security breach directly in the president 's hotel center of the scandal : sex worker @entity123 , 24 , claims she made a commotion at the @entity58 after one of the @entity27 agents stiffed her $ 800 rep @entity189 , chairman of the powerful @entity191 , wants the names of the government employees embroiled in the incident			1
@entity189 has also demanded to know whether federal money was used and if agents had weapons or classified material in the rooms where they brought the women in @entity53 earlier this month			1
he put a deadline on director @entity202 for the information within five days according to @entity205 - and answers as to whether the scandal reaches as high up as the executive office of the president			2
@entity176 said the @entity27 must enact major reforms in the wake of the scandal			2
' if the culture of an organisation is going to change or mistakes like this are not going to be repeated , heads have to roll and that is why i think you are going to find more heads rolling , ’ the he said			0
@entity220 told @entity205 : ' i would think you 'll see most of the 11 either resign , retire or will be forced to leave			0
' i doubt , no matter what happens , you 're going to see any of these 11 ever involved in any kind of detail like this again			0
' the @entity27 , which is tasked with protecting the president , senior administration officials and other prominent figures , said last week that a 12th employee had been implicated in the probe and another had been cleared of ' serious misconduct ' in @entity53 but would face administrative action			1
@entity189 , whose committee was probing the @entity53 incident , said the employee was involved in a separate incident that happened ' five or six days before the president arrived			2
' the @entity237 @entity236 said he had four investigators on the case and had spoken several times with @entity27 director @entity202 about the agency 's own investigation			1
' we want a full record ( of the probe ) , so at the end we can decide if the @entity27 acted appropriately once they found out about it , ' @entity189 said			2
demands : @entity251 chairman rep @entity189 has sent a list of questions to the head of the @entity27 over the prostitution scandal in @entity6 two of the original 11 @entity27 employees involved in the scandal were supervisors , he added			2
' they should have been in control of everything			0
instead , they were accessories			0
they were part of it , ' @entity189 said			0
' among those eleven , besides what they did , they also are in trouble , if you will , for what they did n't do			0
and what they did n't do is report it , ' @entity189 said			0
