by @entity0 an occasional dessert lifts family mood and improves interactions good news for those who have struggled to maintain their @entity7 's diets - new research has revealed that eating dessert can really be good for you			1
the research , which explores everyday eating habits , has identified that an occasional dessert lifts family mood and improves interactions			1
it also shows how children can benefit from family meals - they are more likely to succeed in life , be healthier , do better at school , have higher self - esteem and are less likely to develop eating disorders			1
professor @entity22 - who was once a psychologist for @entity23 - and advised on the study , said : ' we 've known that sharing food has huge psychological , cultural and emotional significance			1
it 's a critical part of our evolution and core to our everyday social world			2
' this study identified that occasionally eating a dessert is producing a blip of happiness which is positively affecting families ' mood , influencing how families are interacting with each other , and is creating happy memories			1
' a spokesman for @entity43 , who commissioned the research , said : ' i know that we all see eating dessert as routine and commonplace			1
' but i 'm sure we 've all experienced the flicker of anticipation and excitement when we know that there is a treat on the way			0
' we had no idea that the humble dessert could have such a psychological effect			1
it seems like the occasional dessert really could give @entity61 families a feel - good boost			1
it seems that many of us have got out of the habit of sitting down as a family and having a meal together			0
discuss as a family why it would be a good thing			2
we all need time for each other away from our hectic lives			0
it may be inconvenient at first , but the positive benefits will make it really worthwhile			2
one evening a week , a special occasion , with everyone helping to prepare , cook , setting the table , clearing up etc. anticipate the event , keep it fun			0
everyone then has a stake in having a good time , the responsibility does not fall on one individual			2
eating a dessert is producing a ' blip ' of happiness which is positively affecting families ' mood 3			1
try to avoid cooking several different meals			2
it is about sharing food			0
the focus should be on the meal itself and the interaction , turn the tv , phones etc off			0
it is an opportunity to talk positively , do n't use it as an opportunity to complain , accuse , challenge etc. if you have to do these , do them elsewhere			0
research suggests that what you talk about during the meal is one of the most important elements in promoting well - being and happiness			1
make it clear that this is something that the whole family should try			0
it may sound strange that something as basic as a family meal has to be approached in this way			0
but for many it will be a step into the unknown			0
rediscover the joy of thinking as a family .			0
