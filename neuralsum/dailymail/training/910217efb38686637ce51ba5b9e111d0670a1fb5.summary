when @entity3 's mate @entity2 died of myelodysplasia in 2011 , the carpenter from @entity1 spent 18 months walking around the coast of @entity6 to raise money for cancer research			1
but in a cruel twist of fate , the 31 - year - old suffered severe head injuries in a motorbike accident just one month after completing his 15,000km walk and raising $ 65,000 for the @entity14 and @entity15 , dying three months later			1
that 's how his devastated father , @entity17 , found himself hosting annual walks for cancer charities two years later and turning the detailed diary his son wrote during his 350 day adventure into a novel titled with every step			1
' he had died while preparing to write the book and i made a vow that i was going to complete the task for him			0
' mr @entity3 said he was left in awe after flicking through the personal notes from his son 's trip			2
starting in @entity44 , @entity3 had walked down to @entity45 and across to @entity46 before continuing on around the country - right through the @entity48 's during the lead up to the wet season in which he endured over 48 degree heat while drinking up to 14 litres of water a day			2
@entity3 ( pictured with his mother and father ) has had his diary entries from the emotionally and phyically challenging trip , turned into a novel , written by his father @entity2 ( left ) died from leukaemia in 2011			1
now his best mate 's diaries , written during his epic trek around @entity6 to raise money for cancer research , are being published determined to accomplish what he 'd started , he even sold his own home to finance the trip			1
he is the third person to ever walk around the entire country solo with no accompanying tour			0
but his father had no idea of the pain his son had endured			0
' he fought temperatures nearly freezing when he slept in a tent in @entity75 , he dealt with plagues of locusts and mice and wild bulls in the @entity80 's , ' mr @entity3 said			0
' he had times when he woke up in the morning and had blistered feet and was in pain before he started and he would still walk 60km somehow			0
' in some parts of @entity6 , he was so detached and isolated between towns - he would be walking for days and days and there would be virtually no civilisation - it was then in his diaries that he wrote that he felt depressed and saw a doctor who said it was the physical relentlessness of the trip			2
' accompanied by only a three - wheeler pram which carried his tent , sleeping bag and a solar panel , @entity3 is only the third person to ever walk around the entire country solo with no accompanying tour starting in @entity44 ( left ) he walked to @entity45 and across to @entity46 before continuing on around the country - right through the @entity48 's during the lead up to the wet season in which he endured over 48 degree heat while drinking up to 14 litres of water a day ' he fought temperatures nearly freezing when he slept in a tent in @entity75 , he dealt with plagues of locusts and mice and wild bulls in the @entity80 's , ' @entity17 said			2
' he had times when he woke up in the morning and had blistered feet and was in pain before he started and he would still walk 60km somehow ' accompanied by only a three - wheeler pram which carried his tent , sleeping bag and a solar panel , @entity3 walked an average of 43km a day while occasionally setting himself extreme challenges such as walking 100km with no stops along the lonely @entity119 - a feat that lasted from 1am until 4:30pm the next day			1
but it was the last video blog that @entity3 posted on his website ozonfoot.com.au that mr @entity3 finds the most tragic			0
' done and dusted ! it 's all over â€¦ day 536 , but tomorrow will be day 1 : getting on with the rest of my life , ' @entity3 filmed himself saying as he walked across the finishing line at the @entity128			2
in a cruel twist of fate , the 31 - year - old suffered severe head injuries in a motorbike accident just one month after the trip , dying three months later ' while i was sitting by his [ hospital ] bedside , i started to read his diary and decided that because there was so much depth to his diaries , that i would turn it into a book , ' @entity17 told @entity35 it was a month after the recording that his mother and father rushed to his hospital bedside in @entity148 , where he had travelled to relax after his huge year , and 12 weeks after it that he passed away			1
' it has been a very tough mourning process , listening to his voice and going through his diary for the book , reading a lot of the things he wrote that we did n't get a chance to discuss amongst ourselves and knowing that i never would be able to , ' mr @entity3 said			2
' he struggled far more than i had realised , even though i spoke to him regularly , so i became in awe of that and in times when i was struggling to get through it and keep writing it i thought " no , i 'm going to keep going because he did "			0
' he just refused to give in until he got to the finish line and that became my drive			0
