by @entity0 published : 16:51 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 07:17 est , 22 june 2012 pensioner @entity1 , who has been locked in neighbourhood dispute for 20 years , has been told to sell his house or go to jail a neighbour from hell was yesterday given the ultimatum : ' sell your house or go to jail ' after a street dispute dating back almost 20 years			1
@entity1 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , had been embroiled in the row with neighbours @entity15 and @entity17 for at least 18 years , after an initial argument over a path to the rear of their gardens			1
the 67 - year - old had been dragged into court several times over the past decade after repeatedly breaching a restraining order banning him from harassing the couple			1
today , he was told that the only option left for the court was to jail him , but that if he sold his house he would , at least temporarily , avoid prison			0
judge @entity31 was told @entity1 's home in @entity12 was on the market , and decided to defer his sentencing until december to give him time to sell the house			1
' it will be in everyone 's best interests if you were to move elsewhere and were i to sentence you to prison today it would probably interfere with a sale , ' he said to @entity1 at @entity44			1
' so , with your agreement and in the interests of your neighbours , i am going to defer sentencing you for the next five and a half months in the hope that by the time you return to court for sentence at the beginning of december you will have a new address and the opportunities for contact between you and your present neighbours will have been removed , or greatly reduced			1
' @entity57 , prosecuting , said that the long standing dispute was first brought to the attention of the courts in december 1994 , when @entity1 was accused of making abusive phone calls to mrs @entity17			1
in 1997 he did the same to mr @entity15 and in 2003 was first given the restraining order after he used a ' laughing machine ' and hundreds of abusive signs to mock his neighbours			1
mr @entity15 and mrs @entity17 were subjected to a recording of the ' mechanical laughter ' when at their homes and insulting signs were displayed in his garden			1
' for the past 18 years there has been a difficulty in @entity75 arising out of some kind of dispute with regard to the land at the bottom of the garden and the footpath , ' said miss @entity57			2
' that 's where the difficulties originated from and mr @entity1 has a number of previous convictions arising out of his attitude towards his neighbours			1
' the 67 - year - old , pictured outside his house , has been before a judge at @entity44 numerous times for breaching a restraining order not to harass neighbours in @entity12 , @entity13 despite being told not to harass them further , @entity1 was back before a judge in 2006 and 2009 for breaching the order and given a 28 week suspended prison sentence , followed by a conditional discharge and an order to pay court costs			1
however , just last month he was again found guilty of disobeying the court rules by insulting mrs @entity17 and mr @entity15 on november 3 and 5 last year			0
@entity103 had told the court he that had actually been talking about the tv show @entity106 when his crass words were overheard by a neighbour			0
however , the jury disagreed and he was found guilty of two counts of breaching the order , although he was acquitted of deliberately making clapping noises to irritate his fellow residents			2
' you feel strongly that you are the victim , rather than your neighbours but that does not excuse your criminal behaviour which the jury found had been repeated last november			0
' judge @entity31 @entity120 , mitigating , said that @entity1 had instructed an estate agent and wanted to sell his home			2
' he has had two interested parties come and look at the house , ' he said			0
' he intends to move away from the area altogether , to the @entity127 area			0
' mr @entity120 said that his client was also undergoing counselling sessions at his local hospital , although the court was told that he did not have a personality disorder or a mental illness			0
he added that @entity1 would ' welcome the opportunity ' to have mediation sessions with mrs @entity17 and mr @entity15			2
judge @entity31 told @entity1 that even if he sold his house , the threat of a custodial sentence would still hang over him , although he said he would ' take into account any developments ' when sentencing on december 7			2
' you feel strongly that you are the victim , rather than your neighbours but that does not excuse your criminal behaviour which the jury found had been repeated last november , ' said the judge			0
' since neither a suspended sentence nor a community requirement have had the effect on you they were intended to have , since your neighbours can not be expected to continue to tolerate you and you disregarded court orders the only appropriate sentence for you is one of immediate imprisonment			0
' speaking after the hearing , mr @entity15 and mrs @entity17 expressed their doubts that @entity1 's behaviour would change - or that he would go through with the house sale			0
' we 'll see , it 's a wait and see situation , ' said mr @entity15			0
in respect of the promised house sale mrs @entity163 added : ' he says that every time we get to court			0

feud between neighbours began with dispute over garden path
@entity1 , 67 , made abusive phone calls , used a laughing machine to taunt neighbours and made hundreds of rude signs
