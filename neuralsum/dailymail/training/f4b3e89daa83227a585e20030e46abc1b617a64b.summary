by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 7 october 2013 cube shaped robots that can flip , jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists			0
the small robots , known as m - blocks , have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and can stick together using magnets			1
while the curious machines might seem like colourful versions of the ' liquid steel ' androids in the terminator films , their creators think they could one day be used to make temporary repairs to bridges and buildings			1
the small robots , known as m - blocks have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and can stick together using magnets in the finale of terminator 2 , @entity28 attempts to kill the @entity31 with a shotgun , but he simply rebuilds himself on the spot			1
@entity31 is made of ' liquid metal ' that is capable of rapid shapeshifting , near - perfect mimicry and rapid recovery from damage			0
@entity42 's robots are not quite the same , but can shape shift researchers at at the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) @entity44 and @entity45 ( @entity45 ) said their modular robots can adapt to different tasks and terrains			1
the m - blocks are cubes with no external moving parts , but are able to climb over and around aone another , leap through the air , roll across the ground , and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces			1
inside each @entity58 is a flywheel that can reach speeds of 20,000 revolutions per minute and when the flywheel is braked , it imparts its angular momentum to the cube , which lets it move independently as well as in part of a group			1
on each edge of an @entity58 and on every face , are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other			1
on each face of a cube are four more pairs of smaller magnets , arranged symmetrically , which help snap a moving cube into place when it lands on top of another on each edge of an @entity58 and on every face , are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other			2
each edge has two cylindrical magnets that are mounted like rolling pins so that when two cubes approach each other , the magnets naturally rotate so that north poles align with south ( and vice versa ) allowing any cube to attach to any other			2

the scientists said that they hope the modules can be miniaturised to one day allow hoards of swarming microrobots to self - assemble like the liquid steel androids in @entity100 they believe that ' armies ' of mobile cubes could temporarily repair bridges or buildings during emergencies , or raise and reconfigure scaffolding for building projects			1
the m - blocks are cubes with no external moving parts , but are able to climb over and around one another , leap through the air , roll across the ground , and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces in the @entity100 storyline , the @entity31 is made of ' liquid metal '			1
@entity118 's character explains that the @entity31 is a more advanced @entity119 , composed entirely of a mimetic metal alloy , rendering it capable of rapid shapeshifting , near - perfect mimicry and rapid recovery from damage			2
it can use its ability to quickly liquify and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways , including fitting through narrow openings , morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons , walking through prison bars , and flattening itself on the ground to hide or ambush targets			0
the @entity31 also had the ability to extrude small , simple items from itself			0
the @entity31 can also change its color and texture to simulate flesh , clothing , and other nonmetallic materials			0
the cubes could one day assemble into different types of furniture or heavy equipment as needed as well as swarming into environments hostile or inaccessible to humans , diagnosing problems and reorganising themselves to provide solutions , according to the team			0
@entity155 , one of the research scientists , said : ' we want hundreds of cubes , scattered randomly across the floor , to be able to identify each other , coalesce , and autonomously transform into a chair , or a ladder , or a desk , on demand			2
' the team is is currently building an army of 100 cubes , each of which can move in any direction and designing algorithms to guide them			2
they also imagine that some of the cubes could be adapted to perform specific tasks and carry equipment such as cameras , lights or battery packs			0
postdoctoral student @entity179 said : ' in the vast majority of other modular systems , an individual module can not move on its own			0
if you drop one of these along the way , or something goes wrong , it can rejoin the group , no problem			0
' @entity190 , a robotics researcher at @entity191 , who was initially skeptical that the robots really worked , said that the robots demonstrate a ' kind of cooperative group behaviour , ' as multiple cubes work together and move other cubes			0
the researchers ( pictured ) believe that ' armies ' of mobile cubes could temporarily repair bridges or buildings during emergencies , or raise and reconfigure scaffolding for building projects			1
