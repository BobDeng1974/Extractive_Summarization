by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 15 february 2013 it was the age when conservation became a fashionable cause among the middle classes			0
indeed , in 1880 many wild birds were granted the protection of the law			0
so when @entity10 @entity9 ’s eldest son @entity8 was accused of blasting an owl out of the sky it is perhaps not surprising that he took umbrage			2
in fact , he did his very best to hush the matter up , sending an imperious rebuke to the well - meaning individual who had dared to suggest he had shot the protected bird of prey			1
the apparent cover - up has only just become known after the letters came up for auction , more than 100 years after they were written			0
after @entity26 is said to have shot a protected owl , well - meaning society snapper @entity24 sent this photograph of the stuffed bird to the @entity30 , which includes the inscription : ' shot by hrh @entity30 on the 23rd sept 1896 at @entity33 ' queen @entity9 's son , @entity8 ( far right ) , later @entity26 , out on a shoot the prince , who was later to become @entity26 , is said to have killed the owl at a royal shoot in 1896 in @entity38			1
society photographer @entity24 took the bird away , stuffed it and sent him a picture of it			1
beneath the bird was a plaque which read : ‘ shot by hrh @entity30 on the 23rd sept 1896 at @entity33			1
’ royal shoot : a photo mr @entity24 took of the hunting party which the @entity30 ( far left , middle row ) was part of when he shot the owl , in @entity33 , @entity38 revealed : the previously unseen letters have now emerged for the first time after being made available for sale at auction rebuke : on @entity54 - headed note paper , the prince got his private secretary to angrily rebuke mr @entity24 and accuse him of inventing the story @entity26 pictured in 1909 @entity57 came a stinging letter from @entity8 ’s private secretary on @entity54 note paper			1
sent to the estate manager at @entity33 , it read : ‘ the prince … is rather annoyed at mr @entity24			2
@entity30 desires me to point out that he was not at @entity33 and also to say that he has not shot an owl for the last 25 years			1
‘ would you mind very kindly asking mr @entity24 what he means by inventing such a story ? ’ a mortified mr @entity24 , from @entity69 , replied : ‘ i am extremely sorry to have caused any dissatisfaction or annoyance to @entity72			2
indeed i sent the photo thinking it would be a pleasant surprise and that it would meet with @entity72 ’s approval			0
’ @entity8 ’s response was unforgiving : ‘ hrh does not quite understand how he [ mr @entity24 ] shows his loyalty by inventing something about him			2
’ at the time , the persecution of wild birds was also becoming increasingly unpopular with the public and was one of the reasons why the @entity84 was founded five years later			0
the @entity85 was passed in 1880			0
this might be why @entity8 denied the claim			0
the photos and letters , valued at around £ 600 , go on sale on february 26 with @entity92 auctioneers of @entity93			0
album : the photographs and letters were made up into an album which was called ' the @entity97 and hrh @entity30 oct 23 1896 '			1
