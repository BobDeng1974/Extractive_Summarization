' i ’m a servant of @entity83 , but no one told me what this was all about			0

a child welfare investigator from the sheriff 's department in @entity114 , where @entity115 lived , went to @entity8 's home in september 2012 after a woman complained to the state abuse hotline that the children were dirty and smelled , living in ‘ horrible ’ conditions , and that @entity8 's younger sister brought a pornographic magazine to school and drew male genitalia			1
@entity8 and her two other children lived with her mother , @entity80 , and @entity8 's four younger siblings , officials said			1

each was born after @entity14 went missing			2
police were still uncertain why relatives had n't come forward before			0
