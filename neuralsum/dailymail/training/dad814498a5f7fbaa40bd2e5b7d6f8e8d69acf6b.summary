the human body is being recreated in miniature by growing tiny working organs on a series of plastic chips connected to each other			1
scientists , funded by the @entity8 @entity7 and @entity9 , are hoping to create a ' body on a chip ' to mimic the way the human body works			1
they have already been able to grow fingertip sized lungs , guts and livers on the chips			1
a computer memory stick - sized chip is created from a flexible polymer so that it has microscopic channels			1
the techniques used to make them are the same as those used to create microchips			0
a porous flexible membrane is placed inside one of the channels and human cells from the airways are grown on top of it			2
on the opposite side cells from a human capillary blood vessel are grown			2
nutrient rich fluid like human blood that can carry away oxygen is flowed down the channel on the same side as the blood vessel cells			0
the airway cells are left exposed to the air			0
this mimics the way the lungs work by allowing oxygen from the air to pass through the membrane lining the lungs where it is carried away by red blood cells in the capillaries			0
the whole structure can also stretch and relax just as the human lungs do when we breath			1
one group , based at @entity21 's @entity20 in @entity67 , is adapting ' bone marrow on a chip ' to study the effects of radiation , for example			1
it is hoped that all of these organs can be connected together to mimic real biological systems or even the entire human body			1
these chip based organisms have been nicknamed ' @entity80 chippiens ' by some working in the field			2
one project supported by the @entity8 @entity83 ( @entity83 ) is aiming to link ten or more organs together			2
according to @entity86 this could be used to study to develop countermeasures against biological and chemical attacks , along with new drugs and vaccines			0
it said : ' the resulting platform should increase the quality and potentially the number of novel therapies that move through the pipeline and into clinical care			0
' another project funded by the @entity99 in the @entity8 is also aiming to join four organ chips together			1
the three dimensional tissues are grown in layers inside plastic chips that are about the size of a computer memory stick			0
each chip contains tiny channels that mimic the structure of the organ and are lined with human cells			1
nutrients are supplied by blood that flows along the channels			0
researchers at @entity21 have been able to create kidneys , gut , bone marrow and lungs on a chip using the technique			1
the lung on a chip , pictured above , attempts to mimic the chemistry and mechanical function of the organ @entity83 wants to combine organs grown on chips to produce a ' body on a chip ' , as shown in the graphic above dr @entity131 , a bioengineer at @entity21 's @entity20 who has been leading much of the work , said the idea was to mimic the chemical and mechanical function of the organs			1
he said : ' this is the idea of replacing animal studies for drug testing with little microengineered devices that are lined with human cells and reconstitute organ level functions			2
' by combining many of these together it could then become possible to study how organs work alongside one another to ensure that a drug that targets one organ does not harm another			2
he said : ' we could link the heart that beats to the lung that breathes			0
' the graphic above shows how lung cells are grown on a porous membrane with blood vessel cells grown underneath			0
fluid like human blood is then flowed along one side of the channel and air along the other speaking to the journal nature , he said that his team were also adapting their bone marrow on a chip to study radiation exposure			1
he added : ' it ’s unethical to expose humans to the kind of radiation that you ’d see in a disaster like @entity174 , but you need to be prepared			0
' the @entity8 @entity7 has been keen to support this work as a way of verifying that its stockpiles of countermeasures against biological and chemical warfare agents do actually work			1
many of them have not been tested in humans due to the ethical problems with exposing them to these deadly weapons			0
microbiologist @entity188 , from the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , told a recent meeting of the @entity190 that he has been conducing tests using anthrax on rabbit lung cells grown on a chip			0
according to @entity195 he said the @entity8 @entity196 want to use similar body on a chip technology to study anthrax in the human body			1
next month the @entity201 is expected to announce plans for an $ 18 - million programme to link ‘ livers on chips ’ with chips that simulate fetal membranes , mammary glands and developing limbs			0
the aim is to study how environmental contaminants such as dioxin and bisphenol a alter metabolism in those organs once they have been processed by the liver .			2

scientists hope to connect organ chips together to mimic a human body
they have created working lungs , gut , liver and bone marrow on the chips
the technology can be used to test medical treatments without animals
the bone marrow on a chip is to be used to study the effects of radiation
the @entity8 @entity7 wants to join 10 organ chips together
