by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 11 october 2013 the parents of a nine - year - old boy who sneaked onto a plane from @entity4 to @entity5 never filed a missing persons report with the police and his father gave up looking for him to go to work , @entity9 has learned			1
the boy ’s parents have said he vanished while taking out the trash last thursday			1
the boy sneaked out of his home in the morning , got on a train to the airport , dodged all security , embarked the @entity17 at 11.15am and after a three hour flight made headlines around the world			1
but @entity9 has learned it was the police - not his parents - who filed the missing persons report and only when they were called by @entity5 police after the boy had arrived there			1
a family friend told @entity9 that the parents thought they needed to wait for 48 hours before informing authorities that their son had vanished			1
he added that they ' thought he must be somewhere '			0
‘ the information they got was they needed to wait 48 hours before you call the police , ’ family friend and anti-violence advocate @entity28 , who is representing the family told @entity9			1
‘ so they were going by certain rules and they thought he must be somewhere			0
’ but a missing child of such a young age would have been a top priority , cops said today			1
‘ with a 9 - year - old that would be a fairly substantial priority for us , ’ sgt. @entity63 , a @entity41 spokesman said			1
he said the search could even call for the best investigators to solve the case			0
mystery : the boy vanished after taking out the trash and the family ' thought he must be somewhere ' so the father , above , went to work ‘ we might even bring in a lot of officers and knock doors and in some cases we might involve some of our homicide investigators			1
’ it has also emerged that the boy ’s father gave up looking for his son on the thursday , and hoped he was just with friends			1
he went to work at a local bus company			2
‘ they were hoping he was at a friend ’s house , ’ @entity28 said			2
‘ and they were calling around and they did n’t know			0
’ @entity28 insists his mom called in sick from her job at the airport so she could search for him			2
‘ he [ dad ] was at work and she took the day off and began to look			2
so they really did do their best to be good parents			2
’ it has also emerged that the boy was at home because he ’d been suspended from school for fighting with another student			1
the apparently relaxed attitude of the parents to where the child was is particularly alarming because just 48 hours before he boarded the flight he had stolen a truck and crashed it into a police cruiser after a short chase			1
the boy 's father said they his son had thought he was playing video game ' @entity117 '			1
his father has admitted that his son 's outlandish behavior has included truancies and slipping passed an entry gate at a local theme park , and was escalating even as young as five - years - old			1
troubled youth : it has emerged that the boy stole this truck and crashed it after a short police chase just two days before his cross-country jaunt string of dramas : the truck incident happened just two days before the boy boarded the flight to @entity5 troublesome : as well as stealing the car , the boy also has a history of playing truant and sneaking into a local water park without paying entry at a press conference yesterday , in which he hid his face in a hoodie and baseball cap , he sobbed as he said he had asked the authorities for help with the boy on countless occasions but had got none			1
he even blamed the airport for his son ’s behaviour , railing at the lack of security that allowed his boy to go through three sets of checks unchallenged before getting on the plane			1
the minor was eventually rumbled by cabin crew – but only when he was 40,000ft in the air			0
the boy is expected to be reunited with his family on friday when he is flown back from @entity5 and @entity28 said his group would help provide them with mentoring			1
leaving : the runaway boy flew to @entity5 from @entity168 on a @entity17 plane like this one , pictured			1
it was only discovered mid-air that he had no ticket @entity28 said : ‘ they are going to get him back			0
yeah of course they want him back			0
' the parents are going to get some help			2
a lot of folks in this community are stepping up to make sure that they get the assistance they need			0
‘ it 's sad because i just had a gentleman come by my office and say “ same thing happened to me , my son 's in prison now			2
i do n't know when he 'll get out			0
now he 's in prison			0
i just want to embrace this family			2
‘ they 're getting the help now			0
but it 's sad it had to come to this - him jumping on a plane for that to happen			0
but they 're going to be okay and we 're going to make sure that we get around this family			0
’ his siblings - an infant and teenage daughter - have remained in the custody of the boy ’s family			2
the parents have also been paid visits by @entity213 , who works for the county ’s @entity214 and @entity216			0
in all , the family have had four child assessments carried out on them			1
in an email titled ‘ private data ’ dated from last december , @entity213 described the boy to fellow administrators as ‘ challenging ’ , the @entity220 reported			0
destination : @entity226 , with the ' @entity5 ' in the background			2
the nine - year - old flew here from @entity4 without a ticket @entity213 added that there ‘ was a pattern of behaviour ’ and that the kid could n’t be trusted			1
‘ typically , staff can tell if a child is lying , but with this child they are unsure what is going on			0
this is a two - parent home , and there is at least one other child			0
’ in her memo , @entity213 wrote that the boy 's future could go two ways			0
if he 's been mistreated , he could be removed from his home			0
if he has a mental health issue , there could be a ' behavioral health response , ' which she did n't explain .			0

family friend tells @entity9 that parents never called the police when their son , 9 , went missing for at least seven hours
it was only when he turned up in @entity5 after getting 11.15am flight from @entity4 did police contact them
friend claims they were searching for the boy but father went to work after a while as they believed ' he must be somewhere '
boy had been suspended from school for fighting and had stolen and crashed a truck two days before his cross-country jaunt
boy expected to be returned to family today
the family has been subject of four child protection assessments this year
