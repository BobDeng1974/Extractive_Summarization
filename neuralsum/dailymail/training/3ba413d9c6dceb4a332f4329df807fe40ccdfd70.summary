by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 25 april 2013 car headlights that make rain ' invisible ' for drivers are under development and could save lives on the roads , engineers say			1
developers hope their brainchild will reduce the number of accidents by improving visibility for motorists in treacherous conditions so they can effectively see through rain			2
the high - tech lights are programmed to detect water droplets and ' dis - illuminate ' them as they fall			1
the light projection system then deactivates the light beams that would otherwise illuminate the rain drops and cause a glare for the driver			1
at low speeds , their system could eliminate 70 to 80 per cent of visible rain during a heavy storm , while losing only 5 or 6 per cent of the light from the headlamp			0
the system is less accurate the faster the car travels			0
it means the driver is less distracted and can focus on the road			0
the ' see through @entity52 ' technology works like a projector rather than a traditional single bulb headlight found in today 's cars			1
currently when a beam shines on a dark road during a downpour , it illuminates raindrops which can distract a driver			0
the new technology relies on a digital camera to establish a drop 's location			0
software then predicts where that drop will fall within the driver 's field of view and light rays from the headlight that would usually illuminate it are turned off for an ' imperceptible fraction of a second '			2
@entity75 engineers say the system would eliminate up to 80 per cent of visible rain during a heavy storm components of the new system , which include a camera , projector and beamsplitter this reduces the glare and leaves only the beams of light which travel uninterrupted between the falling rain , snow or hail			1
@entity91 , an engineer at technology firm @entity75 , said : ' even though the light is slightly diminished from the headlight ( when some rays are switched off ) , it is being diminished from the areas that would otherwise be distracting to the driver			1
' when you eliminate the reflection from the rain , then you are able to see through the rain and see the road much more clearly			0
' i would hope this could save lives on the roads though obviously the rain is still hitting your windscreen			0
' in the worst thunder storm , a motorist in a car travelling at around 20mph would notice a 70 % improvement in visibility using the prototype developed by @entity75 and @entity116 , in @entity117 , @entity118			2
the system becomes less accurate at faster speeds but creators say it would still have a marked improvement on visibility			0
developers hope the technology could be fitted in cars within a decade			1
the research has been developed by @entity75 and academics at @entity116 â€™s @entity129 .			2

develops say the ' see through rain ' technology will help make driving safer
@entity75 engineers say headlights could be in cars within decade
lights detect water droplets and ' dis - illuminate ' them as they fall
lights work as a projector rather than traditional single bulb
