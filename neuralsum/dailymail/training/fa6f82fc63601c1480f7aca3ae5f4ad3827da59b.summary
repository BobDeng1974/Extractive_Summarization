the mark of a good team is they play poorly and win			0
not as poorly as this , mind you			0
@entity5 were very ordinary indeed			2
still , this is their fifth consecutive victory under @entity7 and they have clawed their way up to third in the @entity10 , so they must have something			0
what they had on monday night was a world - class finisher in @entity17			1
since his title - winning first season at @entity5 he has often been criticised , but this was one of those occasions when he was the difference			1
poor defending from @entity26 — horrid for the first goal , in fact — was equally responsible for @entity5 ’s win , but a lesser striker would not have taken his only two chances of the game with such assurance			1
to nutmeg the goalkeeper twice is no accident			0
@entity35 knew what he was doing			2

@entity5 ’s defence still has little on its side but mystery at times , and @entity84 is as capable of having a bad game as a good one			1
@entity117 with swiftness of thought , though			0
sensing that @entity84 was struggling in the heart of midfield , he introduced @entity78 at the expense of @entity77 after 39 minutes			1
having already lost @entity79 to injury , it was a bold move			0
@entity5 were impressive in the last 20 minutes when , having gone in front against the run of play for a second time , they toughed it out as the better teams do			1
@entity131 was impressive in that period , so too @entity80 , @entity79 ’s replacement			0
he had n’t played a @entity10 game since september but held up well to what little @entity26 had to offer by that time			2
to be fair , they looked stunned at what had unfolded			0
at 1 - 1 many here were no doubt thinking of this as two points dropped			0
suddenly they had surrendered all three			0
quality players make the difference			0
@entity35 had two good chances and scored two goals			2
@entity147 was in similarly excellent positions either side of half - time and missed both			2
the game was won and lost right there			2
there were 12 minutes gone when @entity35 gave @entity5 the lead from their first attack of note			1
credit to @entity45 , who did well to apply pressure to centre - half @entity56 , but he can not have expected to force such a thoughtlessly blind backpass			1
it fell to the prowling @entity35 , leaving him one - on - one with @entity49			1
@entity165 ’s understudy advanced but @entity35 ’s smart finish went straight through his legs			1
at that point , it looked as if it might be another sobering occasion for @entity26 against their superiors , following reverses to @entity173 and @entity174			2
@entity5 boss @entity7 ( left ) and his @entity26 counterpart @entity75 shake hands before the match despite their differences @entity35 gave united an early first half lead after capitalising on @entity26 captain @entity56 's mistake @entity35 ( top ) read and intercepted @entity56 's attempted pass to @entity49 ( bottom ) before nutmegging the @entity26 goalkeeper @entity35 ( right ) watches on as his shot is destined for the bottom corner of @entity26 's empty net @entity5 captain @entity45 ( centre ) and @entity87 ( left ) are the first to congratulate @entity35 on his strike @entity35 ( centre left ) also celebrates his goal with a hug from young defender @entity77 ( second left ) @entity5 were forced into an early defensive change when @entity79 ( left ) pulled a thigh injury @entity79 ( left ) had to be helped off the field by a @entity5 physio midway through the first half at @entity108 's but no. @entity75 ’s team quickly rallied and within three minutes , @entity66 had headed a @entity59 corner just wide			1
from @entity26 ’s next attack , they were level			2
@entity84 played a desperately poor pass straight to the feet of @entity59 who went on a marauding run into the area , feeding @entity66 , who was tackled			1
the ball ran to @entity147 wide on the right and his cross was met by @entity63 , whose shot was charged down , only for @entity66 to finish from close range			0
and that set the pattern for the next 40 minutes at least			0
@entity26 should have been three clear when @entity5 scored			1
in first - half injury time , @entity55 crossed from the right , @entity65 won the ball and it fell to @entity147 , who missed an excellent opportunity			2
the second half was little more than five minutes old when @entity63 crossed to the far post for @entity147 , who again squandered the chance			0
after 60 minutes , @entity63 played the pass of the night to put @entity66 in , but @entity26 were found wanting in front of goal a third time			1
@entity66 ( second left ) soon brought @entity26 on level terms when he rifled home their equaliser in the 31st minute @entity66 ( left ) watches on as his left - footed shot soars into the top corner for the south coast side the @entity231 international celebrates his strike in front of a jubilant home crowd at @entity108 's on monday night @entity66 ( centre ) is congratulated on his strike against @entity5 by the rest of his @entity26 team - mates those who followed @entity5 through the glory years had seen it all before			1
mistakes like that get punished			0
and sure enough , 71 minutes in , @entity26 were handed the bill for their profligacy			1
@entity45 swung in the free - kick , @entity35 lost his man at the far post and the merest clipped touch did the rest			1
it was a lovely , intelligent finish — far harder than he made it look , and it sucked the life out of the opposition			0
at that moment , @entity26 were outnumbering @entity5 on chances by virtually five to one			1
after it , they seemed lifeless and subdued			0
‘ we did n’t lose to @entity5 , ’ said @entity75 , ‘ we lost against ourselves			2
’ he had a point			0
is this the turning point for @entity35 ? he was meant to be the perfect fit for @entity117 — @entity261 ’s manager and captain during the @entity263 reunited at @entity264 — but like @entity5 has been unconvincing this season			1
@entity35 hit a wonderful hat - trick for @entity267 against @entity268 last season , but barely played after that and the manager was gone before he returned to the side			2
@entity5 made their second substitution before half - time with @entity78 ( second right ) replacing @entity77 ( second left ) for tactical reasons @entity35 and @entity45 discuss tactics following their a reshuffle by @entity117 in the first half still , that is his sixth goal in 14 appearances for @entity5 this season , not the worst return , and @entity117 ’s team are finally finding ways to win			1
@entity286 visit on sunday — the match sir @entity288 always regarded as the biggest of the season — and @entity5 have the forward momentum in that match - up now , make no mistake			2
for @entity26 , it gets no easier			0
@entity295 , @entity296 and @entity174 are all to come in quick succession , and in the past nine days they have dropped from second to fifth , @entity294 now stealing their thunder as underdogs among the @entity302 elite			0
@entity75 will be only too aware that @entity26 ’s defeats this season have all come against the biggest clubs — @entity286 , @entity306 , @entity174 , @entity173 , now @entity5 — and they will have to overcome that fear of heights in the second half of the season if it is not to drift towards anti-climax			1
@entity5 fans , meanwhile , will dream of chasing down first @entity173 , then @entity296 , just like the good old days			0
they will need to play better than this , though			0
good teams find a way to win when playing badly ; but they do n’t make a career out of it			0
@entity26 left - back @entity58 ( left ) battles for the ball against @entity85 ( right ) during their @entity10 clash @entity45 ( centre ) battles his way past @entity56 ( left ) during @entity5 's victory away at @entity26 on monday night @entity324 ( right ) was booked late in the second half for a bad challenge on @entity35 in the corner of the pitch @entity45 ( second right ) was also booked in the dying minutes of the match after a dispute with referee @entity97			1

@entity17 capitalised on a @entity56 error to give @entity5 an early first half lead
@entity66 equalised for @entity26 in the 31st minute with a blistering left - footed strike
@entity35 restored @entity5 's lead on 71 minutes with the outside of his left - foot from a @entity45 free - kick
the @entity342 have won five straight league games , while @entity26 have lost their last three matches
@entity35 proved @entity5 's star man , while @entity84 and @entity85 had *shockers*
