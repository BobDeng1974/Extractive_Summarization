by @entity0 it was a terrifying near - repeat of the ordeal of @entity3 - the canyoneer who became stuck between two rocks in @entity5 and inspired the film 127 hours			0
this time the real - life drama was played out in rural @entity8 , where an @entity10 rock climber who became trapped between two huge boulders on @entity12 was forced to spend the night in ' very cold ' conditions as rescuers worked desperately to free him			1
luckily for the 24 - year - old , and unlike @entity3 who had to amputate his own arm , his girlfriend was on hand to call authorities and he survived the 10 hours ' wedged ' inside the rock with his limbs intact			1
ambulance @entity8 officers told the @entity37 the man was ' extremely hypothermic ' and said shampoo , olive oil and other slippery liquids were used to ease the man out of the crevice			1
' i believe some of his friends actually went around the campsite at @entity12 waking up a few people just asking for some shampoo or any other lubricants they can find , ' @entity43 said			2
' funnily enough someone did bring up some motor oil but we declined the use of that one			0
' @entity55 : rescuers brought in large heaters to keep the man warm through the 10 hour ordeal he told @entity62 radio : ' he 's been between two very cold rocks for many , many hours			0
his blood pressure is improving			0
' the @entity8 man was attempting a ' squeeze test ' at the location , a popular activity in @entity12 where rock climbers attempt to crawl their way through a tiny gap in a cliff known as ' @entity73 '			1
the man became wedged by his hips around 10pm on monday night and was freed around 8am the next morning			0
in a multi-unit response , @entity77 volunteers , @entity8 police , the @entity79 and local rescue specialists were on hand to help paramedics with the rescue			2
delicate operation : paramedics were fearful the man would suffer from ' crush syndrome ' when he was finally freed they were worried the man would fall victim to a condition known as ' crush syndrome ' - a potentially fatal illness caused by toxins being released into the body rapidly after a significant weight is removed			2
it is believed that because the man was wedged between the boulders , and not bearing any weight , he was ultimately not at risk			0
the man was medicated during the rescue operation and large heaters were used to prevent him from freezing to death , a police statement read			1
he remains in a stable condition , a hospital spokeswoman said			0
the @entity12 squeeze test has plagued climbers in the past and in 2011 a 15 - year - old @entity113 boy had to be rescued after getting stuck .			1
