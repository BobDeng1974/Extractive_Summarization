an identical twin whose sister was murdered by her stalker ex-boyfriend has revealed she wishes she had done more to save her			1
grieving @entity3 , from @entity4 , says she wants to turn back the clock and tell @entity6 that she did n't have to ' put up ' with her former partner 's obsessive behaviour , including bombarding her with hundreds of calls and texts a day			1
but @entity6 , who was strangled to death by @entity11 in a jealous rage in 2008 , never reported his behaviour to police - and paid the ultimate price			1
as part of @entity25 , @entity3 , from @entity26 , @entity23 appeared on today 's @entity27 in honour of her sister			1
she told presenters @entity29 and @entity31 how @entity6 had started a relationship with @entity11 , who was 28 years older than she was , when she was a teenager			1
but shop worker @entity6 found @entity33 , a nightclub doorman , could be obsessive and controlling so she eventually ended their relationship			2
however , @entity3 said he then would n't leave her sister - then aged 21 - alone			1
she recalled : ' in 2009 she left him saying she was n't happy			0
he was very controlling , obsessive and jealous			2
' he would n't stop contacting her			0
he would ring 300 - 400 times a day and that was just phone calls			1
there were also texts and visits			1
' @entity6 was strangled to death by @entity11 , pictured , who used to hound her with calls and messages @entity3 said neither she or @entity6 realised how far @entity11 would go and ' kind ' @entity6 did n't consider reporting him to the police			1
@entity3 said : ' my family and i were worried but she thought she had a handle on it			2
she never said she was frightened for her safety			0
' she was n't scared of him but it was unwanted attention - she made that clear to him but he persisted			0
she did n't go to police as she thought she could deal with it			0
' @entity3 said @entity11 would often turn up unannounced at @entity6 's house to drive her to work , or if she was waiting at the bus stop , he could pull over and offer her a lift			1
this is what happened on june 24 , 2009 , but @entity6 never made it to her work place			0
after offering her a lift , @entity11 , then aged 49 , took her to a layby and strangled her to death			1
he then drove to a police station and told them he had a dead body in his car			0
six months later he appeared at @entity72 where a jury found him guilty of murder			0
@entity3 and tv presenter @entity75 , left , appeared on this morning to promote @entity25 he was jailed for a minimum of 18 years ( later reduced to 16 years )			2
@entity3 now wishes she had urged her sister to put a stop to @entity11 's stalking behaviour			1
she could have sought a restraining order preventing him from contacting or going near her			0
@entity3 said : ' if we could turn back the clock i 'd tell her you do n't have to put up with this			1
' she is hoping others will heed her warning as figures from the @entity89 reveal that one in six women and one in 12 men are stalked at some point in their lives			0
tv presenter @entity75 is also supporting the campaign after being the victim of a stalker himself			0
he revealed on this morning how a woman used to bombard him with hundreds of ' vile and grotesque ' messages			0
@entity75 had to take out a restraining order on a woman who was harassing him he said : ' she was eventually convicted for harassment and now i have a restraining order - that 's all i wanted			2
now she ca n't contact me directly or indirectly			0
' @entity75 added that if people are concerned about harassment , they should n't think they are being silly and should rest assured the police will take them seriously			2
' you do n't have to put up with it , ' he said			2
' if you are getting unwanted attention you can go to the police and get action			0
