by @entity0 dr @entity1 says he would rather have @entity2 than @entity4 diabetes the thought of @entity2 strikes fear into the hearts of many people			1
in contrast , type 2 diabetes is rapidly becoming normalised and many people see it as a mere inconvenience , or even an inevitable part of ageing			0
but now , one doctor has claimed he would rather have @entity2 than type 2 diabetes			0
writing in @entity18 , dr @entity1 said : ‘ as a doctor i can tell you that , medically speaking , i ’d rather have @entity2 than diabetes			2
‘ while this might sound shocking or surprising , the facts speak for themselves : the prognosis for those with @entity4 diabetes is much worse than for those with @entity2			0
’ dr @entity1 goes on to explain that it is now very rare for someone to die of @entity2 in the @entity31 and that , in fact , people with the virus have a very similar life expectancy to people who are @entity2 - negative			1
he says that , assuming patients take their medication , they experience very few problems as a result of being hiv - positive			0
in contrast , he says the situation is very different for people with type 2 diabetes			0
dr @entity1 , a psychiatrist in the @entity47 , says people with type 2 diabetes are more than twice as likely to have a stroke as people without the disease			2
he says they are also four times more likely to have heart disease and that 20 to 30 per cent of patient have kidney problems which can lead to the need for regular dialysis			2
he added that diabetes can also lead to blindness , foot ulcers and amputations			0
he explained that @entity2 can be treated very successfully with highly active antiretroviral therapy ( @entity64 ) which prevents the development of the opportunistic infections that kill people with untreated hiv / aids			1
dr @entity1 says @entity2 ( pictured ) can be treated effectively leaving patients with few health problems			1
in contrast , he says type 2 diabetes is progressive even with treatment and causes a host of health problems he says many people believe that type 2 diabetes can also be easily treated with medication but that this is not the case			1
dr @entity1 explained that the disease is progressive meaning people usually end up needing insulin injections and that they suffer serious consequences from having the disease			0
he concludes : ‘ to put it starkly , the latest statistics show that because of @entity64 , @entity2 now no longer reduces your life expectancy , while having type 2 diabetes typically reduces it by ten years			1

@entity1 says @entity2 is now easily treated with antiretroviral therapy
he says this means patients experience few health problems
in contrast , he says diabetes is progressive regardless of treatment
he says it can cause heart disease , strokes , blindness and amputations
he says @entity2 no longer reduces life expectancy while diabetes does
