a state judge has ordered the @entity1 to turn over records about an x-ray van program the department has kept shrouded in secrecy			1
@entity7 judge @entity6 wrote in a decision back in december that radiation used in the vans raised concerns over health risks and said the department 's claims about information being used by terrorists to evade detection was ' mere speculation			1
' for years , the @entity1 has deployed unmarked white vehicles known as z - backscatter vans used to detect bomb - making equipment , narcotics and other material			2
ordered : a state judge ruled the @entity1 must turn over records about a program using x-ray vans , similar to that pictured here , that the department has kept shrouded in secrecy but the @entity1 has refused to make details of the program known to the public about how the department uses the vehicles to conduct searches , raising privacy concerns			1
the low levels of radiation emitted by backscatter technology has also been shown to mutate dna and thus increase the risk of cancer , which led the @entity45 to ban backscatter technology in @entity48 airports back in 2011			1
the danger posed by the type of radiation used in the scanners is not known , though studies suggest even at low levels , it can increase cancer risk , especially through prolonged exposure			2
the scanners emit a 40 percent higher dose of radiation than an airport backscatter scanner , according to the court decision			2
though little is known about how the @entity1 deploys the vans , they made an appearance in the book @entity66 , written by two investigative reporters from @entity68			0
the book describes how , during the 2004 @entity73 national convention in @entity74 , drivers turning onto a street by the venue had to pass through two x-ray vans that scanned cars for explosives			0
revealing : a photo on the website of @entity80 shows how the technology can be used to reveal contraband , such as smuggled bottles of alcohol @entity85 : the technology can also be used to spot materials like hidden currency , though reports say the @entity1 uses scanners to detect bomb material the december ruling to release documents came after almost three years of legal wrangling by investigative reporting outfit @entity95			1
in february 2012 , the outlet filed a petition under the @entity99 , or @entity100 , for the @entity1 to provide documents relating to the z - backscatter vans			2
it asked for information on police procedures , training documents , purchase records and safety tests , as well as legal decisions or interpretations used by the department to support the deployment of vans			0
the outlet also requested information on data produced by the scanners and stored by the @entity1 , along with the image scans still held by the department			1
the department refused , with former @entity1 deputy commissioner of counterterrorism telling the court in 2013 that revealing the information would put @entity74 at risk			1
the release of records would ' permit those seeking to evade detection to conform their conduct to the times , places and methods that avoid @entity1 presence and are thus most likely to yield a successful attack , ' @entity125 said			0
judge @entity6 said the claim was ' patently insufficient ' to justify withholding information , considering the risks to both health and privacy			0
' this court is cognizant and sensitive to concerns about terrorism , being located less than a mile from the 9 - 11 site , and having seen first - hand the effects of terrorist destruction , ' @entity6 wrote in her decision			0
' nonetheless , the hallmark of our great nation is that it is a democracy , with a transparent government			0
' @entity1 spokesperson @entity154 said on thursday that the @entity1 was planning to appeal the decision .			0

@entity7 judge @entity157 ruled back in december that the department had to turn over information to @entity95
the scanner uses low - level radiation technology similar to that banned at airports in @entity48 in 2011
so far the @entity1 has refused to turn over any information for examination
