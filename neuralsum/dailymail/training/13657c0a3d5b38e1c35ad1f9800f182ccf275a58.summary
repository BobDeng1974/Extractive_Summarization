it 's only february but already @entity1 would appear to be suffering from an acute case of relegation anxiety			1
for the second home game running in the @entity7 , @entity5 's team failed to hold on to a two - goal advantage			1
unlike their previous home game – that they lost 3 - 2 to @entity11 – @entity1 managed to hold on for a point here , a late goal line clearance from @entity14 ensuring that disappointment did n't once again become calamity			1
but @entity1 have now taken one point when they really should have had six and , with a fixture list featuring both @entity24 clubs , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 between now and mid-april , this may yet be the kind of afternoon that ultimately sends them down			2
@entity26 opens the scoring for @entity1 early in the first half at @entity29 in their clash with @entity32 goal scorer @entity26 jumps over @entity33 in celebration after scoring the opening goal on sunday @entity33 then scored the second goal of the afternoon mid way through the first half at @entity29 @entity33 , who was heavily linked with @entity19 during the january transfer window , celebrates his goal former captain @entity41 ( centre ) pulls one back for the @entity32 in added time at the end of the first half substitute @entity48 scores the equaliser in the second half , it was the fourth headed goal of the game @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity53 6 ; @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6.5 ; @entity58 7 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 6.5 ( @entity61 45 , 6 ) , @entity62 6.5 ; @entity26 7 , @entity33 7			1

if that sounds rather negative — @entity1 are not actually in the bottom three at the moment — then that ’s probably because @entity5 ’s team do not currently seem to have the wherewithal to survive			2
they are not short on talent and they are capable of playing attractive , incisive football			0
canny they are not , however			0
they are about as streetwise as a tourist walking down @entity116 with their handbag hanging open and it is this that threatens them as the season begins to drift towards its defining weeks			0
for half an hour here yesterday @entity1 were terrific			1
playing on an uneven surface , @entity5 ’s players passed the ball neatly and purposefully			0
they were two goals up before @entity32 had really got going and the game looked as though it was almost over after goals from @entity26 and the excellent @entity33			1
however , a header from @entity41 just before half - time seemed to signal an almost total change of mood and emphasis			1
sure enough , @entity1 did n’t have the durability to take the blow on the chin and keep moving forward			2
as such , it surprised nobody when @entity32 substitute @entity48 , the club ’s £ 10million record signing , headed in the equaliser in the 67th minute			1
@entity48 was close to a cut - price move to @entity144 club @entity143 on transfer deadline day			1
afterwards @entity5 did his utmost to spin the result positively but the @entity1 manager put his finger on the problem when he said : ‘ the margins are fine in this division			2
you have to be tuned in every inch of the way			0
you ca n’t switch off			0
you have to see every game through and play hard			0
‘ but i thought we were excellent on the whole			0
particularly in the first half i thought we were great			0
’ @entity32 's record signing celebrates his goal on sunday afternoon , it was his third for the club in all competitions @entity165 forward @entity48 posted this message on his @entity168 account following the draw at @entity29 with the score tied at 2 - 2 , @entity32 centre back @entity74 clears the ball off the line @entity83 started on the bench against @entity1 but was brought on by @entity174 after @entity82 got injured @entity79 , who signed from @entity175 in the winter transfer window , tracks @entity1 's @entity62 the 31 - year - old @entity79 , who was making his debut for @entity32 , replaced @entity41 as captain of the side @entity14 of @entity1 tackles @entity32 's january signing @entity77 during the first half at @entity29 certainly @entity1 did n’t look like a team with relegation issues in the first half			1
@entity33 could have put them ahead within a couple of minutes , striking a first time shot just over the bar from 15 yards , before @entity62 came even closer soon after			1
moving on to a low cross from the right , @entity62 ’s side - foot shot was perfectly struck and seemed destined for the top corner before @entity71 reached out a hand and touched the ball onto the crossbar			0
it was a terrific save from the goalkeeper and for a few minutes at least it ensured that parity remained			0
in only the 11th minute , though , @entity1 scored the goal that already seemed inevitable as @entity33 won a tussle at the far post and hooked the ball back across the face of goal for @entity26 to head in from a matter of yards			1
at this stage , @entity32 really were not in the game			1
@entity1 were proving far too purposeful and they broke to score a second goal just after half an hour			1
it was a neat and intelligent dummy by @entity54 in the middle of the field that allowed the always dangerous @entity58 to find some space down the right			0
the former @entity215 player still had much to do from tight on the touchline but his cross was well struck and that allowed @entity33 to meet it 12 yards out and head powerfully down and into the corner to @entity71 ’s left			2
@entity32 manager @entity174 commented later that his team had started the game as though they were still in bed			2
despite the appointment of @entity79 as captain , the visiting team were aimless and rudderless			2
@entity41 ’s header from a corner just before the break changed everything , though , and when @entity48 did likewise midway through the second half it was anybody ’s game			1
@entity1 did come again late on			2
they probably should have had a penalty when @entity73 handled a cross from @entity57 but the @entity1 full back ’s most significant contribution was still to come as he diverted @entity83 ’s late shot away from goal after a mistake from @entity56			1
‘ this is gon na be a tough one , ’ said @entity174 , referring to @entity32 ’s own relegation issue			0
‘ there is n’t that much time to do the things that need doing			0
but this is a good point for us			0
we were much better in the second half			0

@entity79 made his debut for @entity32 and was named as their captain
@entity26 opened the scoring for @entity1 early in the first half
@entity33 *doubled* their lead 20 minutes later with a powerful header
but @entity41 pulled one back for @entity32 just before half time
@entity32 substitute @entity48 scored the equaliser - it was the fourth headed goal of the game
