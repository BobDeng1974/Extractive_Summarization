@entity0 continued the festivities that accompanied his victory at @entity3 by spending time with his engineers and mechanics — and the real gold trophy that goes to the winner of the @entity10 @entity9 — at @entity11 ’ factory in @entity12 on monday he was greeted by a standing ovation from 500 or so staff and was sportingly applauded by @entity15 , his team - mate and @entity18 rival			1
but @entity0 revealed that some of the biggest support he received over a tumultuous weekend came from another @entity22 hero of the track , @entity21			1
‘ @entity21 has been massively supportive this weekend and this year , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ca n’t believe how good it is to have his support after watching him when i was really young and seeing what he had achieved			2
‘ he said hello to me on the grid , just saying that he was proud of me and was rooting for me			2
of all the past drivers , his support has meant the most			2
’ @entity0 ’s win , which was a formality after @entity15 retired with gearbox failure , took him to 27 career wins , level with sir @entity56			1
@entity0 accomplished the feat in 138 races ; @entity56 in 99			1
only one @entity10 driver , @entity21 , has won more often : 31 times ( in 187 races ) , a record that @entity0 is almost certain to overtake , conceivably this season			1
‘ i want to win the @entity18 so i am not focused on that part , but just to be among those drivers is huge privilege , ’ said @entity0 , who was happy to have the gold @entity64 with him yesterday , having been dismayed to be presented with a plastic sponsor trophy on sunday			1
‘ looking at that trophy and seeing @entity21 and ( @entity72 ) @entity71 , ( @entity73 ) @entity74 and all the greats on there is so cool			0
they do n’t have my name on it , i do n’t know why — there ’s no space			0
’ the scenes of jubilation at @entity3 were an echo of the mansell - mania of the @entity85 and @entity86			0
@entity0 army : the @entity10 driver enjoyed fantastic support on home soil in @entity91 podium : the top three pose with their trophies after the race			2
left - right : @entity96 , @entity0 , @entity97 header : @entity0 extended a big lead on the chasing pack and eventually won by almost 30 seconds home patch : @entity10 driver @entity0 celebrating his victory at @entity3 on sunday @entity0 reacts to acclaim and criticism more sensitively than most drivers — ‘ positive energy ’ is one of his favoured phrases — so the @entity3 fillip is important ahead of @entity15 ’s home race at @entity110 , @entity111 in a fortnight			1
as @entity0 pointed out , @entity15 is not a thoroughgoing , lederhosen - wearing @entity111			1
his father @entity114 is @entity115 and he lives in @entity116 , though his mother @entity117 is @entity111 and her country is the one for which he has competed in @entity120			0
‘ @entity15 has never actually been in @entity111 , so it is not really his home race , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when i was racing in karting he did n’t stand next to a @entity111 flag ever , ever			0
they would go on the start line and all the drivers would have to stand next to the grid girl			0
the girls would be holding the flag or the sign saying @entity132 or whatever and he always stood by @entity116			0
’ @entity0 ’s win at @entity3 took him from 29 points to four points behind @entity15 in the standings , with nine of the 19 races completed			1
he said , with relief : ‘ i ’ve been on the back foot since the first race ( when he retired with technical trouble )			0
‘ reliability is going to be a key part			0
you just never know when you are going to have a problem			0
who would have known that @entity15 would have had one at @entity3 ? ’ both @entity0 and @entity15 will test at @entity3 this week but @entity149 , of @entity150 , will be absent after suffering ankle and knee injuries in his @entity154 crash on sunday			1
he hopes to return for @entity15 ’s ‘ home ’ race on sunday week			2
young @entity120 fans were treated to exclusive behind - the - scenes tour of the @entity159 , where they met drivers including @entity0 , @entity162 and @entity163			2
the trip was organised for @entity165 as part of its ongoing relationship with @entity120			0
last week the @entity169 at @entity171 ’s @entity170 raised more than £ 900,000 towards a much needed new surgery centre at the hospital			0
over the past decade , the charity ’s partnership with the @entity120 community has raised more than £ 4 million .			0

@entity0 greeted by a standing ovation by more than 500 @entity11 staff
@entity0 was sportingly applauded by @entity18 rival @entity15
win took him to 27 career wins , level with sir @entity56
