living near congested roads with high levels of air pollution can cause ‘ silent strokes ’ which increase the risk of dementia , scientists have warned			1
exposure to small , sooty particles , mostly caused by traffic fumes and factory emissions , alters the structure of the brain , they said			2
the microscopic particles have previously been shown to cause lung damage and harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting , and are thought to contribute to the deaths of 29,000 people every year in @entity20			1
living near a congested road can increase the chance of developing dementia , research has found researchers examined the brains of more than 900 people aged more than 60 and assessed the pollution risk @entity30 researchers found evidence that living near congested roads or polluted areas can lead to ‘ silent strokes ’ which in turn cause shrinkage of the brain and other damage			1
silent strokes , which arise from blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain , do not have any outward symptoms and the victim is usually unaware of them			2
@entity44 , a professor of neurology at @entity46 , said : ‘ this is concerning , since we know that silent strokes increase the risk of overt strokes and of developing dementia , walking problems and depression			1
‘ we now plan to look more at the impact of air pollution over a longer period , its effect on brain shrinkage over time , and other risks including stroke and dementia			1
’ the study , by @entity63 and @entity46 , involved more than 900 people aged 60 and over who did not have dementia or a history of strokes			1
it recorded how far participants lived from major roads and used satellite imagery to assess their exposure to the fine particulate matter known as @entity74			0
this is made up of small particles measuring just 2.5 micrometres , or 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair			0
these particles are generated from a variety of sources , including power plants , factories , trucks and cars and the burning of wood			0
they can travel deeply into the lungs and have been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes			0
the study participants ’ brain matter was measured using mri scans			0
the researchers found that increases in @entity74 in towns and cities was linked with a 46 per cent higher risk of silent strokes			1
the research was published in a report in the journal @entity107			0
researcher @entity108 , of the @entity109 at @entity63 , said : ‘ this is one of the first studies to look at the relationship between ambient air pollution and brain structure			2
‘ our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with insidious effects , even in dementia and stroke - free individuals			1
‘ the mechanisms remain unclear , but inflammation resulting from the deposit of fine particles in the lungs is likely important			0
’ the study will add to mounting pressure on the government , which faces a judgment at the @entity130 next week over its failure to meet @entity133 legal limits for air pollution			2
sixteen cities – including @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 – have failed to hit air quality targets .			0

@entity30 researchers examined more than 900 people aged 60 and over
*experts* believe that air pollution could increase the risk of ' silent strokes '
microscopic particles in pollution are thought to kill 29,000 people a year
the risk of having a silent stroke can be raised by more than *40* per cent
