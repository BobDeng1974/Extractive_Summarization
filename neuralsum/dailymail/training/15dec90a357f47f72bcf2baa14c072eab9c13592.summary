by @entity0 @entity1 : full - figured women - particularly those with large breasts - were more attractive to men with an empty stomach men prefer voluptuous women when they are hungry – while peckish women are more attracted to muscular men , psychologists have found			1
the phenomenon is rooted in an ancient evolutionary instinct that prioritises people who are seen as having better access to food			1
the researchers believe a woman ’s shape – particularly her chest size – is seen to indicate her level of fat reserves			1
in their study of 124 men who were shown images of five different body shapes , those who were hungry rated women with larger chests as significantly more attractive			1
dr @entity29 of @entity31 ’s @entity30 said other studies have shown women find muscular men more attractive when they themselves want food			1
he said : ‘ if a man is hungry , they prefer slightly larger breasts sizes and slightly larger woman			2
if a women is hungry they prefer more muscular men			1
‘ these are clues about resources			2
if you are hungry you want resources and a partner who has resources			2
someone who is heavier has access to food			1
’ psychologists think that breast size may indicate fat reserves , which in turn indicates access to resources			1
around half of the men in the study had not eaten for six hours , while the rest had full stomachs			1
after being shown images of five different body shapes , the hungry group rated women with larger breasts as significantly more attractive			2
a second set of tests found the less money a man had , the more he liked curvy women			2
dr @entity29 said other studies have shown women find muscular men more attractive when they ’re hungry			1
professor @entity76 , of @entity77 , said at @entity78 that the link between hunger and attraction may be down to oxytocin – a hormone produced during childbirth , breastfeeding and lovemaking			2
@entity87 , which is known as the ‘ love hormone ’ , boosts libido but also suppresses hunger			0
hunger and sex are basic drives but it means we can not pursue both at the same time			0
professor @entity76 said the patterns that dr @entity29 has established may be caused by the oxytocin mechanism , although more research is needed to establish a direct link			0
women with big busts and hips have historically proved popular in periods of economic depression , which psychologists think is because larger women communicate strength , control and wealth in tough times			0
linked to fear : dr @entity29 said people who are afraid feel more attracted to those around them - which could explain infatuations with one 's ski instructor dr @entity29 also said that people find those around them more attractive when they are afraid			0
if he is right , it may mean that taking a prospective lover to a scary movie or on a funfair rollercoaster is a perfect idea for a date			0
it also may explain why people on holiday often fall for their ski instructor			0
but he said the link between fear and attraction is an evolutionary mistake			0
a quickening pulse , dilating pupils and clammy skin – the body ’s reaction to adrenaline – can be mistaken by the body for sexual attraction			0
‘ we misinterpret our arousal , ’ he said			0
‘ it is an error of presumption			0

researchers believe access to food can help determine attractiveness
