when ten - year - old @entity1 cries wolf the whole village comes running - but only to watch her ride on one 's back like a horse through her front garden			1
it 's just one of a handful of party tricks @entity10 has up her sleeve that she performs with the pack of pet wolves her family keeps at home in the village of @entity17 , some 250km north of @entity18 , @entity19			2
she can also roll about in the grass with them and even share a big kiss without a second thought for their razor - sharp fangs and ravenous appetite for flesh			1
she has become inseparable from the furry beasts since her father , @entity30 , the local gamekeeper , took in a group of young wild wolves in 2009			1
but the scenes completely contradict normal behaviour associated with the carnivorous beast			2
unlike their cousins - dogs - wolves are instinctively wild , with a strict code of conduct based on hierarchy within their pack and are some of the most highly - social of all carnivores of the animal kingdom			1
loving : her father , @entity30 ( left ) , is gamekeeper to the village of @entity17 , some 250km north of @entity18 , @entity19 , and took a group of young wild wolves in in 2009			1
here he and wife @entity70 carry one of the pets in front of their house @entity76 kiss : five years on , the wolves are completely domesticated and live with the @entity50 as their beloved pets unusual : but the scenes completely contradict normal behaviour associated with the carnivorous beast unlike many other species of pack animals , male and female wolves tend to operate on an equal footing within their group			1
so , rather than being dominated by a single ' leader ' , a wolf pack is led by an alpha couple - one alpha male and one alpha female			0
these two animals lead the pack during a hunt and often eat first when a kill is made			0
generally , though not always , the alpha wolves are the only wolves in the pack to have pups			0
second in command is the beta wolf , which can be male or female			0
at the bottom is the omega wolf - a scapegoat			0
although there are leaders and weaklings , it is not always survival of the fittest			0
it is always the hungriest that gets to eat first , not necessarily the biggest			0
working together , they ensure each member has a role to play and none are neglected			0
contrary to popular belief , wild wolves are not dangerous and tend to flee at the first sight of humans			1
however , domesticated wolves and hybrid breeds can pose the biggest threat to people as they have lost their natural fear .			2

@entity1 is inseparable from the wolves since her father , a gamekeeper , took in a group of wild wolves in 2009
five years on , the wolves are completely domesticated and live with the @entity50 as their beloved household pets
she loves nothing more than to roll in the grass with them , let them lick her face and even ride on their backs
