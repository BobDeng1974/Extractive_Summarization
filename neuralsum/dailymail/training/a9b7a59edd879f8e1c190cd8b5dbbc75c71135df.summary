vigilante justice is rising in one of @entity3 ’s most violent cities as residents in crime - ridden neighbourhoods take matters into their own hands			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , saw 34 self - defence killings in 2011 - a 79 per cent increase from the previous year , according to statistics in @entity13			1
the ' justifiable homicides ' rate is 2,200 per cent above the @entity3 average , as citizens cope with alarmingly high response times and police cuts			1
that compares to an average of ten minutes in comparable cities across the rest of the country			1
an @entity38 report shows @entity8 homicides ranked second in the nation per capita last year , rising ten per cent in 2011 to 344 people			1
the @entity8 police department rolled out a plan in january to close precincts and district headquarters to the public after 4pm			1
this was an effort to put more officers on patrol , especially in the most besieged neighbourhoods , without adding to the city 's $ 200million deficit			2
the policy took effect in an especially tough area on the city 's east side and spread to the six other stations			2
driving on : @entity59 , is the owner of @entity60 , and has seen the private security business boom in @entity8 , @entity9 and citizens are taking the law into their own hands , arming themselves with guns and guard dogs to fend off criminals , ms @entity26 wrote in @entity13			2
@entity8 resident @entity70 , 73 , told the website the last time she called local police , authorities did n't respond until the following day			1
' we got to have a little @entity74 up here in @entity8			0
that ’s what it ’s gon na take			0
i do n’t intend to be one of their victims , i ’m planning on taking one out ' @entity70 , 73 now she carries a handgun to defend herself against criminals she says are terrorising her neighbourhood			0

' i do n’t intend to be one of their victims , i ’m planning on taking one out			0
' @entity93 said he found himself in a similar situation in november when he was held up at gunpoint in @entity96			0
he recalled neighbours in the middle - class neighbourhood emerging from the street with shotguns as his attackers fled on foot			1
@entity103 helped out : @entity93 was held up by gunmen outside his house in a desirable area of @entity8 three months ago and cops took 25 minutes to arrive it was 25 minutes before an officer arrived to the scene			1
but like many police departments , @entity8 's force is under severe financial constraints			2
immigration officer @entity114 was fed up in 2009 with break - ins at his mother ’s house despite her constant calls to @entity8 police			1
the ex-federal agent spent days hunting down and harassing the teenagers allegedly robbing his mother , prosecutors said			0
he even put his gun into one of their mouths and got a four - year jail term for unlawful imprisonment and assault , reported @entity13			1
@entity93 was held up by gunmen outside his house in a desirable area three months ago and cops took 25 minutes to arrive			2
the criminal justice expert reasoned with his attackers for 20 minutes before he thought they would shoot him , so he ran off			2
@entity103 emerged from the @entity8 street ’s other posh homes with shotguns as the attackers fled , reported @entity13			0
the city has about 2,700 officers , down from 4,000 a decade ago			0
there are few areas to make cuts other than jobs			2
but authorities are loath to do this , particularly in light of the city 's violent crime rate , one of the highest in the country , and a spike in murders			0
compounding matters is @entity8 's size of 139 sq miles , even though the population has fallen from 1.8million in 1950 to 700,000 today			0
as @entity13 reports , residents in wealthier areas are also often hiring private security firms to patrol their streets in armoured trucks			0
business owners at @entity60 and @entity164 , which patrol neighbourhoods , said business is booming			0
a spokesman for @entity168 told @entity13 they are working on lowering response times , and said citizens do have a right to defend themselves			1
‘ it ’s not about police response time because often the act has already taken place by the time the police are called , ’ sgt @entity172 said			1

34 self - defence killings in @entity181 last year
2,200 *%* above @entity3 average as police cuts get worse
response times average 24 minutes for priority calls
precincts and district hqs closed to public after 4pm
