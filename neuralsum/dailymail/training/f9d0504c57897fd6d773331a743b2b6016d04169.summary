by @entity0 a yoga teacher is trying to change the face of the discipline and in the process says she has found a new self - awareness … by deliberately gaining 40lbs			1
@entity7 , a yoga instructor based in @entity8 , embarked on a diet she describes as ‘ see it , eat it ’ to gain the weight , and blogged about her experience the 34 – year - old began to gain weight after hearing a friend and fellow yogi crying over her fear about been known as the ‘ fat yoga teacher ’			1
@entity7 had a healthy , moderate diet and was a typically slim , fit yoga instructor before she began her project , and believed she did n't really care about her weight @entity7 after she purposefully gained 40lbs to challenge notions of the perceived ' yoga body ' @entity7 , who has taught yoga for over six years , says on her blog : ‘ i was taken aback by this statement because i would classify her as beautiful , fit , and trim			1
i wanted to explore her statement			1
‘ i thought this would be an experiment in empowering people to love their bodies and not try to fit society ’s mould			2
’ instead of her usual health - conscious diet , she told @entity38 she began to eat exactly what she pleased - which included plenty of @entity42 food at 5ft 5in , @entity7 ’s weight soon rose from around 130lbs to about 170lbs , a move which she admits might be thought of as ‘ career suicide ’			1
' i want to slay the notion that people who do yoga need to look like the beauties on the cover of magazines ’ @entity7 explains			1
however , rather than the reaction of others to her changing shape , which @entity7 says was minimal , it was the effect of the weight gain on her own sense of self - worth that had the most impact			1
on her blog she explains : ‘ guilt from eating foods i typically considered bad for me were constant companions in my thoughts			0
‘ the stories i made up about what people thought of me were changing and i was emotionally affected			0
suddenly , my self - worth was proving to be connected to how good i looked wearing spandex – something i completely denied caring about before this experiment – and that pissed me off			2
@entity72 admits : ‘ my most shocking discovery through the process is that i ’m afraid of not being loved			0
i noticed the self - talk was that my beauty is only on the surface			2
i feared no man would want me this way and that i would die alone , probably from choking on a potato chip			0
’ @entity7 found that the most profound effect of her weight gain was on her own sense of self - worth @entity72 ended her experiment in july and has resumed her usual healthy diet			1
however she has refused to weigh herself - and insists she has not given up @entity42 food ! when asked what lessons she had learned from her experiment she told @entity38 : ‘ i thought my identity was about how i treated people and the actions i took to make the world a better place			2
but those things were only a piece of my identity			0
‘ i learned that i was – and still am – very judgmental about physical appearance			0
i was afraid of dying alone – i noticed that was a thought coming into my mind			0
‘ i 'm single , and the thought kept coming in , " you 're going to die alone			0
you 're going to die alone			0
" ‘ and so i started to see that i had that thought process , that fear of not being loved , even when i weighed much less			2

@entity7 , 34 , deliberately gained weight by going on a ' see it , eat it ' diet
started after a friend cried over fear of being called a ' fat yoga teacher '
wanted to challenge and explore notions of what a ' yoga body ' should be
went from around *9st* 2lbs to around 12st *1lb* , gaining 40lbs
has returned to healthy diet but wants other women to become self - aware
