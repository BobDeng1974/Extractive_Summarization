by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 12 july 2013 he was running excitedly for his life with 1,200lb of raging bull on his tail			0
in that split second yesterday , this young thrill - seeker ’s carnival adventure turned into a horror show that put him inches from death			1
before screaming crowds and live on tv , he was trampled , tossed and crushed , gored in the groin and impaled at one stage on the bull ’s horn			1
four runners were gored in a run that lasted four minutes and fifty seven seconds , according to local media			1
@entity39 / @entity40 ( @entity41 ) trapped : the man is caught between the horns of an @entity26 fighting bull after being gored he spent 40 seconds at the mercy of the massive black beast before helpers managed to drag him to safety			2
but yesterday the incident reignited controversy over this year ’s @entity22 festival in @entity35 , @entity20 , on what became its bloodiest day			2
three people were gored and at least six badly injured in the run , celebrated annually by participants from all over the world and universally condemned by campaigners against animal cruelty			1
dramatic footage of the 31 - year - old @entity61 ’s terrifying brush with death showed him losing his footing as he and others ran ahead of a single bull			1
desperate : the man tries to escape the bull as a steward gets out a stick to distract the angry animal attack : the half - ton beast gored the 31 - year - old twice in the groin and once in the leg frantic : a runner pulls on the tail of the bull in an attempt to distract it and make it drop the mauled man @entity82 : other runners tried to distract the animal by grabbing its tail and waving newspapers at it			1
but a friend was only able to drag him away after more than half a minute of terror emergency : the injured man , from the eastern @entity20 province of @entity94 between @entity95 and @entity96 , was undergoing an emergency operation this morning			2
his condition was described as ' serious ' it was charging through the narrow , crowded street after it broke away from the stampede			2
instead of simply jumping over him , however , the bull stops and appears to seek out the runner , who is wearing a distinctive blue and yellow shirt			0
he tries to scramble to safety at the side of the street but the bull picks him up with one horn and flings him back into the centre of the road			0
it stamps on him and gores him repeatedly before tossing him in the air			0
one horn penetrates so deeply into the runner ’s thigh that the point can be seen jutting up through his skin on the other side			0
all he can do is grasp the horn and hang on			0
marshals and fellow runners try frantically to free him , pulling the bull by the tail , before he is eventually dragged to safety			0
agony : a 20 - year - old @entity132 was gored in the stomach and a 42 - year - old spaniard in the arm vicious : a man winces in pain as he is gored by a bull - six people in total were taken to hospital after today 's run , the sixth of eight treatment : @entity146 personnel look after a runner or ' mozo ' after being gored by a bull from @entity26 ranch , during the sixth bullrun of @entity21 emergency : @entity146 personnel carry a runner on a stretcher to receive treatment after being gored yesterday he was said to be ‘ serious ’ in hospital and undergoing emergency surgery			1
the bull went on to charge several more runners and spectators before rejoining the rest of the herd			0
the gorings were the first of this year ’s festival , which saw 15 runners taken to hospital with other injuries during the previous five days			1
since records began in 1911 , 15 people have been killed at the event , made famous by @entity172 ’s 1926 novel @entity173			2
between 200 and 300 people are usually injured each year			1
the encierros , as the runs are called , have become increasingly popular with foreigners , who join locals drinking and partying all night before thousands compete in the 8am event			0
the idea is to race ahead of and alongside the bulls , released together at the start of the 850 - metre course			0
but it is a race the animals can never win			0
hours after each run , they are destined to die in a bullfight			0
tradition : revelers from around the world arrive to @entity35 every year to take part on some of the eight days of the running of the bulls annual event : fifteen people have been killed at the annual festival , made famous by a 1926 @entity172 novel , since records began in 1911 run : the event has become increasingly popular with foreigners , who join the locals by staying up all night drinking and partying before thousands compete in the 8am run draw : @entity35 's population of 200,000 swells to around two million during the festival , the largest in @entity20 aggression : an ' @entity26 ' fighting bull charges against a reveler count : hospital authorities initially said four people were gored but the regional government revised that down to three fail : the woman does not succeed as she runs ahead while the bull makes contact sport : a young woman tries to outrun a bull at the close of the running - with - the - bulls in the old city of @entity35 duration : today 's event lasted just under five minutes , roughly double the normal length			1
longer runs normally occur when some of the bulls get separated from the pack and become disoriented and more dangerous the black bull which caused most panic friday made several more attempts to charge people before he was eventually guided along the narrow streets to join the rest for the pack in the pen of the packed bull ring legend : @entity172 popularized the week - long fiesta in his book @entity173 in 1926 deaths : the fighting bulls used in the centuries - old fiesta can weigh up to at 1,380 pounds ( 625 kilograms ) and have killed 15 people since record - keeping began in 1924			1
