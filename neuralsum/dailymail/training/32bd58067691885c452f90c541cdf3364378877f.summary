by @entity0 this is the uncomfortable moment a group of tourists put themselves ' directly in the line of danger ' as they got close too close for comfort to a pair of fighting jaguars			0
wildlife photographer @entity9 was overjoyed when he came across the elusive big cats in their natural habitat , the @entity13 pantanal , the world 's largest tropical wetland area , while filming for a television series			1
but mr @entity9 , 34 , who works for the @entity17 , soon found himself becoming increasingly concerned as he watched tour boats jostling to see which could get closest			1
a group of tourists put themselves ' directly in the line of danger ' as they get close too close for comfort to a jaguar wildlife photographer @entity9 was planning on filming the animals but was blocked by several tourist boats who watched the animals as they fought mr @entity9 said the tourists ' went far too close for comfort			1
these cats have powerful legs and can jump several metres in one bound ' mr @entity9 had planned to film the animals , but was quickly blocked by several tourist boats wanting to get the best view			1
he said : ' i came across this group of young males on the corner of a river in the northern pantanal - they appeared to be play - fighting			0
it was n't long before a group of tourist boats also spotted the scene but i kept my distance knowing how dangerous jaguar are			1
' the tourists went far too close for comfort			0
these cats have powerful legs and can jump several metres in one bound			2
in fact their name comes from the @entity56 word yaguar meaning " he who kills in one leap "			0
' at the time we guessed that they were about 5 metres away just of the edge of the bank			0
' i was in the @entity41 to film various animals for a tv series			1
what i really wanted to film and photograph was jaguar - the biggest cat in the @entity69 and one of the most elusive and difficult to see			1
' i could n't believe my luck when we stumbled across a scene of four jaguar on a bend in the river ( we only ever got a shot of 3 in the same frame ) - a female and three large , but immature , males			0
we assumed that they were closely related and this would be a unique opportunity to film and photograph natural behaviour			2
' mr @entity9 was overjoyed when he came across the elusive big cats in their natural habitat , the @entity13 pantanal , the world 's largest tropical wetland area , while filming for a television series mr @entity9 said while the area is officially protected , it is down to common courtesy and an unwritten code between guides for good practice to be observed mr @entity9 said he was guided by a mr @entity95 , who grew up navigating the waterways of the @entity41			1
he said : ' his philosophy is very much the same as ours - to observe natural behaviour and not to influence it			2
so we did the safest and least intrusive thing we could and moved our boat to the opposite bank where we could use our long lens to capture the action from a safe distance			0
' unfortunately less than 10 minutes later several boats sped into the scene , straight in front of us , blocking our view and putting themselves directly in the line of danger			2
as the numbers of boats increased the drivers became more aggressive towards one another , cutting each other up to get closer and closer until they were too close for comfort			2
' the cats were clearly disturbed by this and did n't stay around long - but had they been so inclined it would have been easy for one of the jaguar to run and leap straight into a boat			0
' mr @entity9 said while the area is officially protected , it is down to common courtesy and an unwritten code between guides for good practice to be observed			1
mr @entity9 counted himself lucky on the trip , having had ' seven stunning @entity133 sightings in three days ' , although he describes the experience as having an unsettling aspect mr @entity9 said at one point during the journey he ' had been following otter along a river in the northern pantanal when i looked up and saw the transfixed eyes of a @entity133 staring out from the shade			1
it 's one of the few times that i 've looked an animal in the eye knowing that i was the prey ' he said : ' mr @entity95 said that many of these boat drivers had no training in good practice and did not realise , or care about how their behaviour influenced the animals			2
' sadly it 's a scene that 's too common in natural parks around the world , but it 's important to remember that without tourism many of these areas would be under threat			0
everyone has the right to experience nature and wildlife , but the organisations and companies who manage this have a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of the wildlife is paramount			0
