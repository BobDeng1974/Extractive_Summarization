fierce fighting raged in eastern @entity1 last night as government forces and @entity4 - backed rebels each tried to seize territory ahead of today ’s crucial peace talks			1
@entity1 troops advanced on rebel frontlines near the seaport of @entity10 , a key coastal position between rebel - controlled areas and the @entity15 peninsula			1
@entity4 - backed separatist forces moved to encircle the vital railway hub of @entity18 , the focus of vicious fighting in past weeks , cutting it off from supply lines			2
it is understood that at least seven @entity1 troops have been killed in the most recent fighting along with two civilians			1
a further 12 civilians were injured			1
fighting between the two sides in @entity1 has intensified in recent weeks an elderly woman has to be helped to her feet after discovering that the apartment block where she lives has been damaged by shelling refuge : the lucky ones who make it to @entity45 are housed in dusty old railway cars , stinking of coal - heated boilers and barely functional toilets railway car : the families set up camp in the cars ’ sleeping compartments , using old railway linens and donated blankets to ward off the freezing temperatures outside pensioners and parents with young children caught in the firing line between @entity1 and @entity62 rebels backed by @entity63 , rifle through piles of donated clothes in @entity68 - era army tents			1
crowds of people pack into the cramped shelters next to @entity45 railway station , which are serving as a base for a small group of volunteers providing food and clothing to an ever - increasing number of refugees flooding into this once quiet coal mining town in east @entity1 ’s war torn @entity33 region			1
inside the tents , haggard looking former residents of @entity18 and @entity85 queue for plates of porridge and pickled vegetables , telling harrowing stories of grad rocket barrages and life in bomb shelters			1
‘ a week ago i dislocated my shoulder and had to find a way out , ' said native @entity97 , who asked that her surname not be published for fear of recrimination towards family members who remain behind			0
' the shelling is constant			0
there was no way i could stay			0
my entire family stayed behind			0
' i have no idea if they ’re brave or just stupid and do n’t understand how serious the situation really is			0
’ with little coordinated help from the international community and an economy in free fall , the @entity1 government relies on local private donors and volunteers to care for the daily stream of displaced people pouring into areas controlled by units loyal to @entity122			1
life in @entity18 and nearby @entity85 – a major rail hub of 300,000 people - has been nothing short of hell on earth for those who have endured months of heavy shelling from both sides			2
since the fall of @entity135 – and with it most of @entity122 ’s best combat troops - to @entity62 forces two weeks ago , @entity18 , in particular , has become the focus of a drawn - out national tragedy			1
harrowing : the refugees tell disturbing stories of grad rocket barrages and life inside bomb shelters keeping warm : pensioners and parents with young children caught in the firing line between @entity1 and @entity62 rebels backed by @entity63 rifle through piles of donated clothes in @entity68 - era army tents childhood : parents , with their children in tow , are housed in dusty old railway cars , stinking of coal - heated boilers and barely functional toilets on the outskirts of @entity33 , people carry plastic bags filled with their personal belongings from a burning apartment block for the @entity1 public , the months - long stand at the airport came to represent a modern - day @entity167 – with the defenders cast as @entity170 and his 300 @entity172 warriors in a heroic last stand			1
for @entity18 , however , the fate of the beleaguered civilian population and the outnumbered units that continue to hold the line , is rapidly beginning to resemble @entity178 in the early 1990s			0
pro-russian rebels have nearly cut the city off , leaving thousands stranded and huddling in makeshift bomb shelters			2
@entity183 and artillery shells are fired indiscriminately from their positions and into the town			0
a brief ceasefire last weekend succeeded in most of the population being led to safety , but estimates from most aid agencies place the number of those who stayed behind at as high as 3,000			0
grandmother @entity194 said : ' the bombing ( in @entity18 ) never stops			0
' the shells hit homes , schools , parks , it does n’t matter			0
my house took a direct hit from a rocket			0
rebel - controlled areas as of tuesday february 10 have been highlighted in red on this map of eastern @entity1 armed : @entity209 forces fire a grad rocket towards @entity62 separatists in eastern @entity1 on sunday firefighters work to extinguish the blaze at a residential block			2
today , the @entity1 national guard has launched an offensive against @entity62 separatists near the southeastern port city of @entity10 @entity183 are fired towards separatist forces in @entity1			1
president @entity220 has signaled he will wait for the results of high - stakes talks on @entity1 before deciding whether to arm the @entity122 government ' it was at that moment that the kids ’ parents and i decided we should get everyone out			1
' with her four grandchildren surrounding her , she added ‘ we hope to be here for ten days or so , after that we do n’t know where to go			0
’ those who remain trapped in the city endure constant shelling and attacks with notoriously inaccurate grad multiple rocket launchers			0
basic amenities have been cut and access corridors out of the city are growing fewer by the day as heavy fighting in and out of the centre becomes fiercer			0
the lucky ones who make it to @entity45 are housed in dusty old railway cars , stinking of coal - heated boilers and barely functional toilets			1
these relics of the @entity256 ’s vast railway network are , for now , temporary homes of hundreds of families , many of whom no longer have a standing home to return to or relatives to stay with			2
these relics of the @entity256 ’s vast railway network are , for now , temporary homes of hundreds of families new home : many of the refugees living in the train cars no longer have a standing home to return to or relatives to stay with shelter : refugees , young and old pack into the cars , each uncertain as to when or if they ’ll ever leave inside the tents , haggard looking former residents of @entity18 and @entity85 eat plates of porridge and pickled vegetables @entity274 and old pack into the cars , each uncertain as to when or if they ’ll ever leave			2
the families set up camp in the cars ’ sleeping compartments , using old railway linens and donated blankets to ward off the freezing temperatures outside			2
many others – including the elderly – are left sleeping on the cabins ’ cold wood benches			0
the older generation , who lived through the horrors of @entity292 , stoically brave the cold and cramped living conditions			0
parents do their best to look after their children , while never allowing them to see the deep sense of fear and uncertainty in their eyes			0
' we left @entity85 a day ago because of the fighting , ' members of the @entity302 family , who declined to provide their names , said			0
' it ’s getting worse every day			0
' @entity4 president @entity307 ( centre ) with @entity310 chancellor @entity309 ( left ) and @entity312 president @entity311 ( right ) at peace talks in the @entity314 last week talks : @entity220 , at a @entity317 news conference with visiting @entity310 chancellor @entity309 , said providing weapons to @entity1 was among the options he and his advisers were considering whole families have been uprooted in recent days as the rebels come closer to their objective of fully surrounding @entity18			1
today , the @entity1 national guard has launched an offensive against @entity62 separatists near the southeastern port city of @entity10			1
the secretary to the @entity329 and @entity330 , @entity328 , ' is near @entity10 , where units of the national guard broke through enemy defences and went on the offensive ' , a statement from @entity1 's security council said in an online statement			1
separatist gains against @entity122 government forces in eastern @entity1 , particularly a rebel advance on the transport hub of @entity18 to the northeast of @entity33 , have added impetus to a @entity344 - @entity310 initiative to try to end the crisis			1
president @entity220 signaled on monday he will wait for the results of high - stakes talks on @entity1 before deciding whether to arm the @entity122 government , saying diplomacy and sanctions remain his preferred tools to resolve the crisis			1
@entity220 , at a @entity317 news conference with visiting @entity310 chancellor @entity309 , said providing weapons to @entity1 was among the options he and his advisers were considering			2
fighting between @entity62 rebels and pro-government forces loyal to @entity122 has intensified in @entity1 's south east region since the new year pro-government forces unload grad rockets from a truck before launching them towards @entity62 separatist forces outside @entity18 in eastern @entity1 but he made clear he had reservations about upping the ante in @entity1 and endangering @entity369 - @entity368 unity in the contest of wills with @entity4 president @entity307			1
@entity309 opposes sending weapons to @entity122 to help it fight @entity4 - backed separatists			2
' it is true that if , in fact , diplomacy fails , what i 've asked my team to do is to look at all options , ' @entity220 said			0
' but i have not made a decision about that yet			0
' despite prompting by a @entity310 reporter , the @entity369 president pointedly declined to lay down a ' red line ' that , should @entity307 cross it , would prompt him to authorise weapons for @entity1			2
in the face of a new offensive by separatists in eastern @entity1 , some of @entity220 's top advisors , as well as hawkish @entity369 lawmakers , are pressing him to do more to help the @entity1 government defend itself			1
but that question has been overshadowed , at least temporarily , by a revived diplomatic push led by @entity309 and @entity312 president @entity311			0
the pair are due to meet with @entity307 and @entity1 president @entity400 in @entity401 tomorrow			2
the conflict between @entity4 - backed separatists and government forces has now killed more than 5,300 people and displaced more than a million .			1
