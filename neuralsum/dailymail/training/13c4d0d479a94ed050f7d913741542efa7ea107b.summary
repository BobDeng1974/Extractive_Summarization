by @entity0 @entity1 made @entity3 sporting history with a fourth gold medal of these @entity5 here at the @entity7 in @entity8 on friday and then dissolved in a fit a giggles when asked what it meant			1
‘ i ’m speechless , i can not believe it , ’ said the 16 - year - old gymnast from @entity14 , who is 4ft 6in tall but has gone from being largely unknown to a giant of achievement within just a few days			1
her gold on the floor on friday followed others in the individual all - round and team all - round finals , and the vault			1
quadruple : @entity3 's @entity1 won her fourth gold medal of the @entity5 on friday glory : the 16 - year - old ( centre ) added the women 's individual floor event to her other three titles to put these medals in context , no other @entity3 woman , in any sport , has ever won four golds at a single @entity5 before			1
only one other @entity3 woman , in any sport , has ever won more than four games golds in an entire sporting career , and that person ’s career ended with every conceivable gong in global sport , from @entity49 and world titles to @entity51 gold			1
the woman in question was hurdler @entity54 and it took her three @entity5 to win her five @entity5 golds between 1986 and 1994			1
@entity1 was born in 1997 and says she fell in love with gymnastics in 2003			1
‘ i was six years old , ’ she said			0
‘ i was so bubbly , jumping all over the house and my mum wanted to get me doing something			0
straightaway i just loved it , i liked the determination you needed and i wanted to progress			0
‘ gymnastics is about needing to love it and going for it 100 per cent … the fact is i can just express myself and go wild , because i ’m so bouncy and everything , it ’s just great			0
’ jumping high : @entity1 's score of 14.541 was enough for her to claim her fourth gold medal of the @entity5 @entity1 had a grin from ear to ear and a spring in her step during a floor routine that scored 14.541 , well clear of @entity79 ’s @entity78 and @entity80 of @entity81 in the silver and bronze positions			1
‘ the floor does let you show your personality , ’ said the teenager			2
‘ my floor routine is very bubbly and hip - hoppy			1
’ before deeming any @entity91 gymnastic success a barometer of global potential , it should be stressed @entity94 remain dominant in this sport			0
but @entity1 now has a world top - three finish in her sights at october ’s world championships in @entity100 , @entity94			1
‘ i ’m expecting to get to the floor final at the worlds and then hopefully get in the top three , ’ she said			2
she added it was ‘ really good ’ to be part of a revolution in @entity91 gymnastics that has shown every sign here of making solid progress from the advances made at the @entity112			0
@entity3 ’s final medals tally in the gymnastics was nine golds , five silvers and five bronzes to leave them top of the table ahead of @entity81 in second place ( 8 - 3 - 4 ) with @entity121 in third ( 2 - 2 - 1 )			1
in the artistic events , @entity3 won five of the six women ’s disciplines , with @entity3 men ( four golds ) and @entity121 men ( two ) taking six of the eight men ’s titles			2
@entity3 ’s @entity132 ( below ) had been hoping for a fourth gold of these @entity5 yesterday but had to settle for a bronze in the parallel bars			1
the gold was won to rapturous applause by @entity121 ’s @entity139 - born @entity138 , with @entity140 of @entity141 taking silver			1
routine : @entity1 has already won gold in the individual all - around , vault and the team events in @entity8 @entity140 , 18 , at his first major senior competition following a glittering junior career , then went one better on the parallel bars to take gold , scoring the same world - class points total as @entity3 team - mate @entity152 ( 14.966 ) but pipping him with a better technical mark			1
@entity152 had earlier won a vault silver behind @entity155 of @entity81			2
there is an exuberance and camaraderie now between all the @entity91 gymnasts that suggests they can make an impact at @entity51 level in @entity162			0
@entity132 insisted that these @entity5 are a significant point in the gymnastics calendar en route to that goal			2
‘ it ’s a massive competition for us , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a big stepping stone and our main job is to go out and get big scores			0
the judging is still the same , whatever the competition			0
’ on the promise of @entity140 , he added : ‘ it ’s his first @entity5 and he ’s come out here and performed like a true senior and fitted into the group really well			2
three brits on the podium ( in the parallel bars ) is massive for us			0
p - bars are n’t our strongest piece in @entity91 gymnastics and yet we ’ve just got three scores of 15 and over			2
‘ that ’s a massive statement to the rest of the world and hopefully we can go and do that on the world stage			0
‘ @entity193 is a very confident young lad and that ’s a good thing , he loves the crowd and that all helps him , he handles the pressure			0
’ @entity138 , whose mother is from @entity199 and whose father is from @entity201 , said : ‘ i did n’t really expect to get the gold			2
just to get a medal would have been fantastic			0
i ’m just absolutely over the moon			0
