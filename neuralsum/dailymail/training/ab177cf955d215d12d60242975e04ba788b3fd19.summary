by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:18 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 24 july 2013 the rabies - infected man whose organs went to four people , including a kidney recipient who died , is now revealed to have been bitten by raccoons at least twice in the months before he died			1
tests have now also confirmed his rabies - infected kidney caused the recipient 's disease and subsequent death and that the rabies originated from raccoons			1
doctors initially attributed the death of @entity19 @entity18 recruit @entity20 to other causes , but an investigation prompted by the kidney recipient 's death in february found evidence of rabies in the @entity20 ’s brain tissue and also brain inflammation , which can be caused by rabies			1
no idea : @entity20 , 20 , had been in the military just a short time when he died and his organs were donated to four recipients in four states			1
doctors at the time thought he 'd eaten tainted fish the virus was consistent with raccoon rabies and was nearly identical to a virus found in the transplanted kidney and other tissue from the recipient , an @entity39 veteran from @entity40 , said the report , compiled by researchers from the federal @entity49 and others and published tuesday in the @entity51			2
investigators do n't know if organs given to three other patients — the @entity20 ’s heart , liver and second kidney - were infected with the rabies virus , but all three were considered at risk			1
their recipients received anti-rabies treatment ‘ and to date remain well , ’ said @entity49 researcher dr. @entity62 , the lead author			2
unfortunate : @entity20 's son @entity64 is seen here with his mother @entity66			1
when @entity67 learned that @entity20 had died of rabies , she was n't surprised			1
' he did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff			0
' she said , though @entity20 was never tested warning signs : a wall of @entity20 's bedroom in @entity76 , @entity77			1
it has been revealed that @entity20 was bitten by two raccoons prior to his death from rabies and the farming of his organs that killed one kidney recipient while the case is rare , it underscores the need to improve screening for would - be organ donors with suspected encephalitis , the report 's authors say			1
they say a uniform donor questionnaire could help better identify risk factors for the virus and that rabies should be considered in donors with unexplained encephalitis			2
doctors in @entity100 did n't test 20 - year - old small for rabies before he died and his heart , liver and kidneys were donated to recipients in @entity100 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity40			1
the recipient in @entity40 received an infected kidney and died 18 months after @entity20			1
the patients who received the man 's other organs started getting the rabies vaccine this month , but none of them has shown symptoms of the rare disease			1
tragic : @entity20 showed signs of rabies before his death , but his body was n't tested for the disease before his organs were farmed out to four recipients in four states , one of whom died 18 months later deadly : it took 18 months for the kidney recipient to die of a rabies infection , which is almost unheard of			1
the further from the brain , the longer the infection takes to spread			2
@entity20 was bitten months before his death rabies is a deadly viral infection that usually occurs when a person is bitten by an infected animal			1
the most common animal to infect humans is the raccoon , and some believe incidences will rise as the creatures become more common in urbanized areas			2
the time between the infection and when symptoms occur , the incubation period , ranges from as short as 10 days to as long as seven years			2
the average period is three to 12 weeks			0
symptoms generally include : drooling , convulsions , excitability , loss of muscle function , muscle spasms , numbness and tingling , difficulty swallowing			0
untreated , rabies can lead to coma and death			2
once rabies symptoms appear , the person infected rarely survives the disease , even with treatment			1
an estimated 55,000 deaths from rabies occur around the world each year			2
an estimated two deaths from rabies occur in the @entity19 each year			2
the majority of those infected die from respiratory failure , which typically occurs within seven days from when symptoms begin			0
@entity66 , the mother of his young son , originally revealed that @entity20 was the infected donor			1
@entity67 said she was n't surprised to learn that @entity20 had died of rabies , and not a stomach virus as she ’d been told , because he liked to hunt and trap animals			1
' he did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff , ' she said			0
' he did the trapping , and he did n't care what the animal looked like			2
he just picked it up			0
' @entity20 had been in the @entity18 for 17 weeks before he died			1
he was in @entity100 to train as aviation mechanic			0
he visited a clinic at the @entity188 in august 2011 for abdominal pain and vomiting and was transferred to a civilian hospital four days later @entity20 's initial symptoms included nausea , vomiting and fever — which could indicate rabies but also other less serious conditions that are much more common			1
doctors thought @entity20 had eaten tainted fish			1
the @entity200 issued guidance last year to help organ procurement organizations screen for encephalitis and other central nervous system infections in potential donors			0
it urged caution in accepting organs from donors with an untreated central nervous system infection			1
the researchers want to improve awareness that rabies can be the cause of encephalitis , said co-author dr. @entity216 , another @entity49 researcher			0
but he added , ‘ we would n't want to mandate any screening that would potentially exclude transplantable organs			0
’ the study is based on a review of laboratory tests and medical records , and interviews with relatives of the organ donor and recipient			0
it provides the most detailed account of the chain of events that led to the two deaths and the investigation that followed , which prompted health authorities to recommend vaccines for dozens of people who were in contact with the donor or recipients			0
the case attracted public attention because of the rare circumstances , including the long time between infection and death of the transplant recipient — about a year and a half			0
it was just the third documented transmission of rabies through a solid organ transplant , the report says			0
@entity251 problem : as this 2010 map shows , rabies - infected raccoons are most common along the @entity251			0
@entity20 was likely infected during a hunting trip in @entity100 prior to his death in 2011 more widespread : bats are another animal more likely than others to transmit rabies to humans and infected animals occur throughout the @entity19 also , there are only roughly two human rabies deaths in the @entity19 each year , and all but two domestic cases between 2000 and 2010 were linked to bats , according to the report			1
the authors say raccoons pose an under - recognized risk for infection and their spread into urban areas raises concern			0
the patient who received the @entity77 donor 's kidney at the @entity277 in @entity278 , @entity40 in september 2011 has not been publicly identified			0
investigators say they learned during subsequent interviews that @entity20 trapped raccoons for use as bait during hunting - dog training exercises , and had been bitten at least twice by the animals , 18 months and seven months before developing symptoms			2
he was not treated for those bites			0
‘ if you do n't ask specific questions , you do n't get specific answers , ’ said dr. @entity288 , chairman of an advisory committee on disease transmission for the @entity200			0
‘ at the time these questions are being asked initially , families are often traumatized , in shock , ’ @entity288 said			0
‘ they 're losing a loved one			0
they may not be thinking normally or straight or remember all those details			0

@entity20 was an avid wild animal trapper and showed evidence of rabies infection
he was never tested before his organs were donated and family was *unsurprised* the *outdoor* *enthusiast* had the deadly disease
three other recipients are said to be doing fine , though none have been identified
