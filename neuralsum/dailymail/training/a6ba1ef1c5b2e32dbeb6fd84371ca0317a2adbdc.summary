with the promise of a superfast internet connection , it was billed as one of the biggest technology launches the @entity5 had seen			0
but less than 24 hours after the 4g wireless service became available for mobile phones in 11 cities nationwide , questions were being asked about its claims to be five times faster than the current 3g network			1
initial reviews and online comments suggested speeds were not quite as promised – while some even suggested that @entity17 connections had been slowed down to make the new service look quicker by comparison			2
it was launched in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity22 , the company behind @entity22 and @entity51 , launched its 4g service on tuesday , a full six months before its major rivals @entity54 , @entity55 and three , are able to enter the market			1
customers who sign up for a contract are being promised speeds of between eight and 12 megabits per second ( @entity61 ) , as fast as the average home broadband connection			2
it means that from now on they should be able to download items , watch videos and view large documents without a long wait			0
but the @entity69 ’s technology correspondent @entity68 , who was among the first to try out the new service , said his own experience was less impressive			0
the new @entity31 network was launched in 11 @entity5 cities and will be joined by five more before @entity74 , providing coverage to over 20million people			1
it is currently offered only by the @entity22 network , with customers paying £ 36 a month upwards			1
@entity31 should allow users to watch videos without them freezing , download web pages at high speed , and allow smooth video - phone calls			0
it ’s quicker than its predecessor @entity88 because it crams more data into the radio signals used to transmit and receive data to phones			2
drawbacks are that the phones will run out of power more quickly – and in areas of poor mobile reception , may not be any better than @entity17			0
earlier this year the government admitted that when @entity31 transfers to a different spectrum next year , it may interfere with the @entity103 signal , which is on an adjacent spectrum			2
experts say about two million homes are likely to experience @entity103 interference and the government has set aside £ 180million for them to have signal filters fitted			1
‘ for 36 hours , i have been trying out @entity31 in two cities where it has been launched by the @entity22 network , ’ he wrote			1
‘ everywhere i ’ve gone in @entity47 and @entity48 , outside , indoors , on trains and in cars , i ’ve used a speed - testing application			0
‘ and while i ’ve seen some breathtakingly fast results , there has also been some worrying evidence that the speed and extent of the @entity21 is being oversold			0
’ he also claimed the @entity21 would not stretch as far as his @entity47 home			0
there was further criticism from @entity22 customers who had not upgraded to @entity31 , who claimed their 3g service had been slow or down all week ahead of the much - anticipated launch			1
one wrote on @entity130 : ‘ my @entity22 has been slow or down all week in @entity47			2
forcing people to upgrade to @entity31 by making @entity88 unusable			0
where the hell is [ communications regulator ] @entity133 ? ’ another commented : ‘ is the reason my @entity88 has been so terribly slow in and around @entity136 recently a ploy to make @entity31 look faster than it actually is ? ’ last night , an @entity22 spokesman insisted that its 3g services had not been slowed to highlight its new service , adding : ‘ this is the fastest network roll - out of its kind anywhere in the world			1
by the time other networks finally launch their own 4g services , @entity22 will have an unrivalled @entity21 and will continue to build on this			1
’ @entity22 , ceo of @entity22 says today is a ' landmark day ' for the firm as it launches @entity5 's first @entity31 network			1

@entity22 network is live today in 11 cities
claims to offers speeds five times faster than current networks
questions raised in the @entity160 over interference with @entity163 tv signals which could affect up to two million consumers when rival networks launch next year
