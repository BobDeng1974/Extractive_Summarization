by @entity0 @entity1 has come under fire for preloading its handsets with its own apps which can leave customers with just half the amount of advertised storage on flagship models			1
researchers have found that the so - called ' bloatware ' is rarely used by consumers , with many spending just seconds on the apps before deciding to use downloaded apps instead			0
@entity1 supplies everything from chat to password apps , some pre-installed with the device and the remaining accessible via @entity20 and @entity1 app stores			1
@entity1 has come under fire for the amount of ' bloatware ' it preloads on its handsets , with claims the apps are rarely used by consumers despite @entity1 's heavy push in content and apps , @entity28 and @entity29 users look beyond its ecosystem for the vast majority of apps			1
bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones , tablets , or computers			1
as well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files , bloatware can also slow down your device			0
bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars , desktop widgets or other unwanted additions			0
' despite @entity1 ’s heavy push in content and app strategy through @entity58 , @entity59 , and in - house apps , @entity28 and @entity29 users look beyond its ecosystem for the vast majority of on - device usage , ' said @entity63 , which analysed the data			1
based on @entity71 march 2014 @entity66 panel data on 250 - plus @entity28 and @entity29 users , the total time spent across key @entity69 on its flagship devices - @entity28 and @entity29 – came just under 7 minutes , whereas the same @entity73 user spent 149 minutes amongst three of @entity74			1
' in terms of content discovery and updates , @entity75 and @entity76 , its primary channel for content downloads , is again lagging behind the segment leader by a wide margin			0
, ' said the firm			0
recent tests by which ? magazine found that unwanted bloatware and system files still occupy 46 per cent of the phone 's internal storage - eight months after intial concerns were raised			2
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity92 's @entity91 was the best performing handset , assigning a relatively low 21 per cent of storage to built - in apps and the @entity98 operating system			1
@entity101 apps , by comparison , were a huge hit with @entity1 customers @entity104 , chief , @entity105 , said : “ clearly , @entity107 series have succeeded in creating more engagement by growing the overall pie , but its own content and media strategy is faring low at the moment			1
' @entity113 is a step - upgrade from the @entity29 , but as far as content and media is concerned , little has changed to draw consumer attention to its latest launch			2
' @entity71 data shows a typical @entity28 / @entity29 user spends 64 minutes / month ( combined ) on @entity20 , whereas the same figures for @entity75 and @entity1 app store are just 0.6 minutes			1
however , in terms of overall usage , @entity73 is a top performing device , where @entity28 and @entity29 users ( combined ) consume 14 % more video and 24 % more data above the industry average			2
@entity129 , vice president , said : ' our data shows that @entity29 users on average have 21 more apps ( includes pre-installed and downloaded ) than the industry average			2
' obviously , @entity1 ’s dominant position in the market is an ideal vehicle to drive own - branded content services across its installed base , but @entity1 should develop a differentiated set of apps that will resonate with its key user base			2
' one of @entity1 ’s famous apps , @entity145 , which is said to have crossed the 100 million users mark , was used for just 6 seconds per month by the users			1
in comparison , users spent over 151 minutes on @entity150 and over 11 hours on @entity151 per month			2
in january , which ? magazine tested the eight most popular @entity154 handsets from @entity1 , @entity92 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity101 , pictured			0
@entity1 's @entity29 was the worst performing handset , with only 54 % ( @entity158 ) of available storage , while @entity92 's @entity91 was the best , with 79 % ( @entity160 ) bloatware includes apps and files that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they are sold to customers			1
which ? magazine recently tested the eight most popular @entity154 handsets including @entity92 's @entity170 and @entity91 , @entity1 's @entity29 , @entity101 's @entity171 , the @entity172 , @entity155 's @entity173 , the @entity174 and @entity156 's @entity175			1
the @entity29 offers just @entity176 of available storage , down from @entity177 in tests carried out in may			2
@entity92 's @entity91 has @entity179 , while the @entity170 offers slightly less at @entity180			0
@entity156 's @entity175 and @entity174 have just short of @entity181 and @entity182 respectively			0
some of the preinstalled @entity1 files are needed for its new features , such as eye tracking , air gestures and voice commands			0
some of the preinstalled @entity1 files on the @entity29 , pictured , are needed for features such as eye tracking , air gestures and voice commands			1
others , however , are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps , games and the @entity196 and @entity197 hubs			0
many of which ca n't be removed others , however , are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps , games and the @entity196 and @entity197 hubs			0
to add insult to injury , many of these apps and hubs ca n't be removed			0
it 's likely the difference between @entity92 's models are due to the @entity170 running more advanced features than the @entity91 , and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner			0
as technology researcher @entity215 explained in a blog post : ' the reality is every phone has to sacrifice some of its internal memory to the operating system - they never live up to the sales talk of 8,16 or @entity221			0
' but many manufacturers further stuff their phone with pre-loaded apps , skins and bloatware			0
and no phone has more piping , braiding and frills than the @entity29			0
' @entity92 's @entity91 , pictured , has @entity179 of available space , while the high - end @entity170 offers slight less , as @entity180			0
it 's likely the difference between @entity92 's models are due to the @entity170 running more advanced features than the @entity91 , and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner the @entity1 findings show the handset has not improved since tests last may - and has actually got worse			2
@entity1 responded to criticisms at the time advising people that a solution that to the problem is to buy a microsd card if they want extra storage : ' for the @entity29 16 gb model , approximately 6.85 @entity158 occupies the system part of internal memory , which is 1 gb bigger than that of the @entity28 , in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers , ' explained the @entity256 firm			1
' to offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users , @entity1 provides a microsd slot on @entity29 for extension of memory			1
' yet , as @entity215 points out , the three phones that topped the latest which ? tests - @entity92 's @entity91 , @entity170 and @entity101 's @entity171 - do n't have memory card slots meaning that although they offer more overall , this ca n't be expanded like the @entity29 .			1
