@entity0 faces paying £ 40million - a - month in fines if @entity2 refuses to pay the @entity4 's surprise demand for an extra £ 1.7billion by december 1			1
@entity6 officials revealed interest would be charged at 2.5 per cent for every month the @entity0 fails to pay , rising higher still if it drags on for months			1
however , the prime minister 's hopes of rebuffing the demand were boosted last night as @entity12 insisted there is a ' widespread willingness to find a solution to this issue '			1
@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 are among those told they will get money back from @entity6 the @entity26 issued the demand last month after using rules dating back to 1995 and finding @entity0 's economy has grown faster than expected , so must pay a greater share to @entity6			2
to add insult to injury , @entity20 will receive a £ 790million rebate because its economy is struggling			0
bizarrely , @entity21 is also in line for a rebate while countries like @entity38 and @entity12 must pay more			2
mr @entity2 has angrily insisted he will not bow to the demands , declaring : ' i am not paying that bill on december 1			1
if people think i am , they have got another thing coming			0
it is not going to happen			0
' however , the @entity0 is now being warned that it will face fines for not paying , levied through increasing interest payments			2
@entity26 spokesman @entity48 said : ' ' each member state has to pay what is due			0
if payment is not made by 1 december there is a process of interest being accumulated			2
' @entity0 faces an interest rate based on the base rate of the @entity57 – 0.5 per cent – plus an additional two per cent			2
this would be 2.5 per cent for the first month , worth an extra £ 42million			0
the interest rate would then rise by an extra by 0.25 per cent per month			0
by the end of 2015 it would reach 5.5 per cent , or £ 93.5million			0
meanwhile @entity12 , which faces a bill of almost £ 270million and holds the @entity4 's rotating presidency , has signalled it is keen to strike a deal to avoid a prolonged legal wrangle			1
chancellor @entity66 said the @entity4 was ' causing problems for us ' – and warned the continent was ' pricing itself out of the world economy ' an @entity12 government source said : ' this is not the end of the story			1
there is a widespread willingness to find a solution to this issue			0
' chancellor @entity66 will use a meeting of @entity4 finance ministers in @entity6 on friday to lobby for changes to the bill			1
@entity85 says the government is still examining the detail of the rules used by @entity4 officials to calculate the astonishing demand , linked to better than expected economy growth			1
mr @entity66 warned that the @entity4 is ' not working for @entity0 ' and warned the continent was ' pricing itself out of the world economy '			1
he told the @entity97 's @entity96 programme : ' @entity0 joined [ the @entity4 ] for economic reasons , and when it 's not working economically for @entity0 that 's why we get this debate about the membership of the @entity4 and the nature of that membership			1
' i 'm someone who wants to stay in the @entity4 , i think that 's right for @entity0 , but it has to be a reformed @entity4			1
' he said that the @entity4 was ' morphing more and more into a eurozone focused on the survival of its currency '			0
he added : ' it 's perfectly all right for the @entity0 to say as the big country that 's not in the euro , this relationship is not working properly for us			2
' @entity0 faces the biggest increase to its payments covering the last four years			0
the @entity0 is being asked for an extra 2.1billion euros			0
