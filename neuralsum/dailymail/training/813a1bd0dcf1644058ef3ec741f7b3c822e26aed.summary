the inquiry into historic child sex abuse is to be extended to crimes committed as long ago as the @entity3 – and possibly even further			1

those suspected of committing crimes will be handed over to police and could face jail			1
tough stance : justice @entity15 says the inquiry into historic child sex abuse is to be extended to crimes committed as long ago as the @entity3 – and possibly even further the extension in the investigation , sparked by claims of a 1980s @entity20 paedophile ring , was revealed by justice @entity15 , the new head of the inquiry , in an interview with @entity23			1

but justice @entity15 is backing demands to go further			1
' it 's elastic , ' she says			0
' the terms of reference talk about going back to 1970 but there is a push from certain quarters to take it back to about 1945			0
a cut - off point is always a bit artificial – someone who falls on the wrong side of it is aggrieved			0
' the @entity23 understands that @entity46 is backed by mrs may , who is considering removing all time limits , meaning it could take in the entire @entity50			0
either way , it will be the world 's biggest ever investigation into paedophiles – and will take years			1

' i do n't feel intimidated , ' she said			0
' nobody should be beyond the reach of the law			0

' the @entity20 aspect is just one , ' she said , confirming she will look at ' institutional allegations going back to @entity94 '			2
justice @entity15 also said she believed child sex abusers of 1945 should be treated the same as those in 2015			1
' sexual abuse of little children has never been anything short of a serious crime and that does not alter through religious or cultural mores or a different era or time , ' she said			2
