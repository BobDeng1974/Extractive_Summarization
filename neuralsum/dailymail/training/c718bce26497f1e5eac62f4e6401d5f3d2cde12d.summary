any boyfriend intending to propose to his better half would be thrilled if he could preserve the moment forever with a secretly taken photograph - as long as she says ' yes ' of course			0
but one loved - up man went to extreme lengths to ensure he would have a permanent record of that life - changing moment - by hiding a photographer in a nearby bin			0
@entity12 popped the question to his girlfriend @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , on saturday morning			1
he wanted to capture the moment but , to maintain the surprise , he had to hide his snapper			0
pop the question : @entity12 gets down on one knee to girlfriend @entity14 spot the snapper : unbeknown to her , photographer @entity24 was hiding in a bin nearby tight fit : mr @entity24 insisted his hiding place was n't too much of a squeeze ' as i 'm a relatively small guy ' with no obvious places to hide , photographer @entity24 ingeniously decided to hide in a green bin			1
mr @entity24 said : ' there were n't too many places to hide so i jumped in the bin			1
' i 'm a relatively small guy so it was n't too bad a fit			1
' @entity12 got @entity14 to walk down towards the lake , where i was already hiding ready to take photos			0
busted : after saying ' yes ' miss @entity14 spotted the friendly voyeur who was positioned just yards away snapped back : she took her own picture of him hiding in the bin to remember the day by diamond idea : miss @entity14 shows off her engagement ring after the unusual proposal ' a few romantic words later , @entity12 proposed , and @entity14 said yes ! ' all of a sudden she spotted me and could n't stop laughing			2
' mr @entity24 is a wedding and engagement photographer and arranged with mr @entity12 to plan a fake date at the zoo			1
once the happy couple got to the side of the lake , mr @entity12 lowered down on to one knee and popped the question			0
as the couple celebrated , miss @entity14 spotted mr @entity24 cowering in the bin with his woolly hat on to ward off the cold			2
fortunately , she found it funny and started taking her own pictures to capture the happy moment			0
downside : mr @entity24 was n't lucky enough to find an empty bin , and snapped the rubbish inside his hideout			2

@entity12 asked @entity14 to marry him at zoo in @entity16 , @entity17
wanted to capture the moment but without her spotting photographer
so snapper @entity24 climbed into nearby *litter* bin to hide
' i 'm a relatively small guy so it was n't too bad a fit , ' mr @entity24 said
