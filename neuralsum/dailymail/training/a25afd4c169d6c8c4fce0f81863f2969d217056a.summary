by @entity0 @entity2 's players have been getting to know new boss @entity3 and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits			1
here , @entity6 has exclusive extracts from @entity0 's explosive new book on the @entity9 which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at @entity13			1
there are some things even @entity3 can not control			1
a life that has always had hard work , discipline and order as its core values was sent into a whirlwind when his first wife lost her fight with cancer			1
he had met @entity27 when he was only 18 and she was two years younger			1
friends said it was love at first sight as they locked eyes at the @entity34 youth society near his home			2
in his position in charge of @entity55 ’s biggest football club he had access to all the best doctors and surgeons , but nothing could be done			1
instead , @entity60 found himself confronted by challenges beyond his control			2
while he did his best to tend his wife in private , in public he had to show iron discipline as @entity9 fans mocked their ordeal			1
in @entity55 , there are two words for woman			1
‘ @entity72 ’ shows respect for a loving partner			2
‘ @entity76 ’ is insulting - translated as something like ‘ bitch ’			2
at one @entity47 game , rival fans held a banner referring to his wife ’s cancer			1
the placard read : ‘ @entity60 , heeft een kankerwijf ’ , which would roughly translate as ‘ @entity60 has a cancer bitch ’			1
it must have hurt but he refused to let anybody see his anger			2
it was only 11 years later , in a rare interview about life outside football , he revealed the devastating effect the episode had on him			1
asked to name ‘ the last time you cried ’ , he admitted : ‘ when my wife died in 1994			1
’ tough to take : @entity60 was mocked by @entity47 's rival fans during his wife 's illness but refused to show his anger there is still a picture of @entity40 - with whom @entity60 had two daughters - in the house he shares now with his second wife , @entity104			1
they met not long after @entity40 ’s death and were partners for 14 years before @entity42 proposed in 2007			1
he could n’t go down on one knee - he had a broken leg at the time ! they married on his birthday - 08 - 08 - 08 - as the invitations pointed out			1
@entity60 guards his private life closely but while @entity104 wanted to secretly tie the knot in @entity115 , he flew 80 friends to @entity117 where they have a holiday home near @entity119 , to join the celebrations			2
paradise : @entity60 gestures whilst snapped on holiday with wife @entity104 in @entity123 back in 2003 @entity104 revealed : ‘ the wedding was wonderful			2
it was important to me , not so important to him			2
he always regarded me as his wife but the media kept referring to me as “ louis ’ girlfriend ”			2
i did n’t like that			0
‘ i wanted to go to @entity115 , just the two of us , but @entity42 wanted a big celebration			0
he said : “ if you have something to celebrate , then celebrate ”			0
a secret marriage would have been wrong			0
his daughters from his first marriage belonged there as well			0
’ the home in @entity117 remains their sanctuary			0
it was there that @entity2 officials travelled for talks within a few days of sacking @entity150 has looked at houses in @entity152 to follow @entity60 to his new job , even if she admits she would love to settle for the good life in the sunshine			1
she said : ‘ @entity42 ca n’t help himself			0
he believes in himself and his methods			0
i ’d thank the lord if he quit			0
’ @entity60 is clearly as much the master of all he surveys at home as he is in his professional life			0
‘ at home he does n’t do a thing in the house ; he does n’t even know how to make coffee , ’ says @entity104			0
‘ he likes me to spoil him and i like to do just that			0
’ but he does have a sentimental side			0
talking about the picture of @entity40 in their living room , she says : ‘ why not ? she is a grandma , too			1
i bought the two grandsons a little @entity175 jersey ( while he was head coach at @entity177 )			0
you should have seen louis ’ face			0
louis is a warm - blooded human being			0
it ’s sad not a lot of people know this			0
