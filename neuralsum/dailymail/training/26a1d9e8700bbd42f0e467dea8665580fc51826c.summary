@entity0 believes the government should introduce a tax on sugar to halt the obesity crisis mr @entity5 played a big role in my childhood			1
not only did he help fund my schooling and summer holidays , but he also filled my house with all manner of sweet delights , syrupy treats and sickly treacles			0
for my father was an executive with @entity17 , the country ’s leading sugar manufacturer , whose packets were decorated with the famous cartoon cube figure			1
every now and then , arriving home from his office , he would deliver the firm ’s latest innovation from his briefcase for our testing			0
as a young boy , i devoured these sugary creations , which i imagined came from some @entity32 - style factory overseen by the friendly - looking mr @entity5			1
back in the @entity37 and early @entity38 , of course , most of the rest of my diet was prepared by my mother or school dinner ladies and , like other children , i spent long hours running around parks and playing fields			1
in those days , fast food was a soggy cheese and tomato sandwich			0
today , my son laughs when i tell him i can recall my first @entity48 ’s , savouring those famous burgers as if they were haute cuisine			0
how innocent such times seem compared with now , when most children spend hours each day staring at screens , fast - food outlets litter high streets and advertising constantly beseeches us to buy sweet treats			1
the result ? obesity has become a national crisis threatening to overwhelm the @entity63 , which is being forced to treat ever - growing numbers of patients with weight problems and associated health problems so severe they end up in hospital			1
no one should be under any illusion about the scale of the gargantuan challenge this crisis presents			1
just listen to @entity75 , the smart new chief executive of the @entity76 , who this week warned that obesity is ‘ a slow - motion car crash ’ that threatens to cripple an already overburdened service			1
he said : ‘ if as a nation we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline , we ’ll be piling on the pounds in terms of future taxes needed just to keep the @entity76 afloat			0
’ as politicians talk of raising taxes to further fund the @entity76 , and hospitals fall into debt , diabetes alone is already draining £ 1 in every ten spent on healthcare , and excess weight causes almost one in four deaths from heart disease			0
meanwhile , fizzy drinks and sweets are causing a surge in tooth decay , with 500 children admitted to hospital each week with rotting teeth			1
a quarter of @entity102 adults and a fifth of children are obese - numbers which have doubled in the past 20 years health trusts have to splash out on super-size ambulances and £ 8,000 beds to cope with patients weighing up to 78st			1
alarmingly , this could be just the beginning , as a tidal wave of avoidable ‘ lifestyle ’ diseases swamps the @entity76			0
shockingly , in clinical terms a quarter of @entity102 adults and a fifth of children are obese — numbers which have doubled in the past two decades			1
in total , two - thirds of @entity102 men and more than half the nation ’s women are considered to be overweight , which presents a greater threat to public health than smoking			1
as a result , we have a generation of children who , because of their diet , their weight and their inactivity , could live shorter lives than their parents and grandparents — which would turn around historic trends of longer life expectancy			1
@entity102 ’s obesity problems are among the worst in @entity140 — but this is a global concern , as is all too evident on streets from @entity143 to @entity144 and @entity145 to @entity146			1
forget the tired old cliches pushed by the foreign aid industry : two - thirds of the world ’s overweight people are now found in poorer countries , where more people now go to bed having consumed too many calories than go to bed hungry			1
the question , of course , is how to turn the tide — something that defeated every one of the 188 countries studied in a recent @entity162 investigation of global obesity over the past three decades			2
i used to think the solution was simple when i started to see more and more unsightly mountains of fat and flesh wobbling through @entity102 towns and cities : they should eat less and exercise more			1
and so they should — this remains the best dietary advice available			0
yet blaming gluttony and slothfulness alone will not solve a problem of such severity			0
public warnings from the government and health experts have had some impact			2
sales of fizzy drinks , for instance , have fallen over the past six months , while shoppers are buying fewer bags of sugar and more fresh fruit			2
yet , thanks to the addition of so much sugar in processed food and drink , the amount of ‘ invisible ’ sugar ending up in the bellies of @entity102 has risen by almost a third over the past two decades			1
this has made doctors increasingly desperate in their calls for action			0
some even argue sugar is addictive , having a similar impact on the brain ’s reward circuits as drugs such as cocaine			2
certainly , it ’s clear many obese patients get locked into a tragic and ever - worsening spiral of depression , low self - esteem and compulsive over-eating			1
this is why bariatric surgery — the fitting of gastric bands — may prove ultimately to be the most cost - efficient treatment			1
one obese woman told me how she would binge in fast - food joints then pretend not to be hungry at home , while her soaring weight mystified her family			1
her growing size made her more miserable , which led her to gorge even more on burgers , chips and fried chicken			0
so what is to be done ? instinctively , i recoil at nanny - state diktats , lectures from politicians ( of all people ) over how to live our lives , and the idea of government intervention unless absolutely necessary			2
but the health crisis unfolding before our eyes demands urgent action — even if it has to be forced on us through legislation			2
put away the suncream and the beach towels - there ’s fewer than 100 shopping days to go before @entity245			2
last week , online grocer @entity247 sent its first email advising customers to book their delivery slot for @entity245 , @entity246 has followed suit and @entity252 ’s will do so in mid-october			0
@entity253 , the smart department store , opened their @entity256 shop in the first week of august , while @entity257 started taking ‘ priority bookings ’ for its @entity259 ’s grotto only a week ago			0
not to be outdone , catalogue outlet @entity261 last month published its predictions for the most wanted @entity245 toys , with @entity265 , foam - firing @entity267 guns and a customise - your - own @entity269 set expected to sell out			2
and this week , ‘ @entity245 ’ has appeared as one of the most commonly typed words or phrases on @entity274			0
but do n’t panic , website @entity275 has a ticking timer showing the days , hours , minutes and seconds until @entity278 , should you forget			0
there is a recent precedent which convinces me there is a solution : the war on smoking has shown that social habits can be changed			0
the imposition of hefty taxes on the cost of cigarettes , along with a smoking ban in public places , has saved thousands of lives — along with millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money that might have been wasted on treating smoking - related diseases			1
@entity298 peaked in 1974 , but since then has slumped			0
last year alone , sales of manufactured cigarettes fell in this country by another 11 per cent			0
now we need to do something similar to save the nation — and its health service — from drowning in a sea of fat			0
this means taking on the food industry and imposing significant taxes on all that lethal sugar they stuff into their wares , even those such as dried fruit , cereals and yoghurts which are promoted as healthy products			2
we should also enforce tobacco - style warnings on food and drink packets , as well as wide - ranging advertising restrictions			1
manufacturers and retailers will howl about hitting the poor hardest with the rising prices that would probably result from such a tax , but the truth is that this is the very social group who are the biggest victims of obesity			1
no doubt , politicians will prevaricate , fearing they will be blamed for putting up the cost of living			2
naturally , they will also calculate that the cost of political inaction to the health of the nation — not to mention the @entity76 — will be felt long after they have left office			2
but the introduction of a tax on sugar can not wait			1
ask yourself why @entity343 yesterday announced it was introducing a women ’s size 32 in its shops , and what that says about the shape of our nation			0
it pains me to argue for higher taxes on anything , let alone something so interwoven into my own life			0
but sometimes statistics do not lie			0
one government agency suggested that a 20 per cent tax on soft drinks alone could cut the number of overweight @entity102 by 250,000			1
the curious thing about @entity17 ’s mr @entity5 is that he was a very political figure , created in 1949 at a time when sugar was still rationed and @entity365 was threatening to nationalise the sugar industry			2
when the sword - wielding character first appeared , he angrily attacked state control and promoted private enterprise in speech bubbles			0
he symbolised a public mood seeking more freedom to enjoy the sweet things in life , even appearing in political cartoons alongside @entity377 and @entity378			0
but we live in very different times today — and we need to stop seeing sugar as something benign and cuddly			0
with apologies to mr @entity5 and all that he stood for , the state must take action to confront something that has become a modern scourge .			0

@entity0 believes tax on sugar should be introduced to halt obesity crisis
he also suggested tobacco - style warnings and advertising restrictions
gastric bands could prove to be most cost - effective treatment , says @entity0
a quarter of @entity102 adults and a fifth of children are now obese
