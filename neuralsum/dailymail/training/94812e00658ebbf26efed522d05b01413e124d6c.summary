a group of divers received a revolting surprise when they were engulfed by a giant underwater poo cloud while photographing a sperm whale underwater			1
described as a ' poonado ' by @entity6 photographer , @entity7 , 30 , the peculiar behaviour is thought to have been evidence of a rarely seen defence mechanism			1
but the routine dive soon took a turn for the strange when the whale began releasing wave upon wave of faecal matter right in front of their eyes			2
the marine mammal managed to create a whirlwind of excrement by spinning on its side and flapping its tail			0
although it is n't uncommon to see whales defecate before they descend , this was a bowel movement with a difference , spanning over 30 metres in diameter			1
to make matters worse , mr @entity53 prefers to dive with just goggles and a snorkel as bubbles from scuba diving equipment tend disturb the whales			0
he said : ' four of us got into the water near the whale , then it slowly approached us , stopped , and pointed itself straight down before storm began			2
' at first , it seemed like a regular bowel movement but rather than continuing its dive down , it remained at the surface and continued to defecate for a startling length of time			1
photographer @entity7 said he had ' poop in my eyes , mouth , wetsuit , everywhere and i was soaked in it from head to toe ' the whale swims through its own 30m - wide bowel movement , which quickly enveloped the shocked divers ' four of us looked at each other with confusion , then back at the whale , expecting that any second its call from nature would come to an end			1
' instead , the whale bobbed up and down , spun in circles and waved the poo in every direction for several minutes while we just sat back and watched			2
' the water was crystal clear , initially , and was the most idyllic @entity98 blue water that you could imagine			0
' after a few waves of faeces were released and stirred vigorously by the whale , the water was like chocolate milk , i could n't see my hand when i held it in front of my face			1
' i had poop in my eyes , mouth , wetsuit , everywhere and i was soaked in it from head to toe			0
but , after leaving the cloud , it quickly washed away , and did n't leave a smell on us			0
' i did take an extra long shower once i returned to shore later that day , just in case			0
' i 've never heard of it happening before , and i do n't know anyone that has had this happen , it very well could be the first time that it has been photographically documented			0

the sperm whale released a massive bowel movement as it was being filmed in the waters off the island of @entity30
@entity6 photographer @entity7 , 30 , said the water was like ' chocolate milk ' and was left covered in faeces
the whale 's peculiar behaviour caught on *camera* is thought to be a rarely seen defence mechanism
