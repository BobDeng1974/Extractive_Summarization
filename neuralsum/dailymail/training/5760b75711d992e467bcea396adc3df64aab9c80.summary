gone but never forgotten after six sensational years of tiki - taka delight			1
@entity4 ’s sell - by date turned out to be june 2014			1
hopefully @entity5 will flicker only momentarily across our short - term memory and we will wind back the clock to @entity9 , @entity10 2010 , and to @entity11			1
two - time champions of @entity21 , first - time champions of the world and playing a brand of football that involved pass after pass after pass then boom			1
four years on : @entity22 lifts the @entity23 in @entity10 after beating @entity24 in the final delight : the @entity28 captain lifts the @entity30 trophy in 2008 ( left ) and 2012 not everyone ’s cup of tea , which is why some may delight in the demise of @entity4 and their frills			1
hopefully , most will reserve a nod of respect for the legacy left by the delightful dancing , swirling matadors			2
football historians of the future will certainly be able to pigeon hole the second decade of this century into its own unique category			2
just as professionals were getting taller , bigger , more muscly , along came these smaller , trickier , talented players			2
they put the fizz into physical and the result was a joy to watch			0
every so often a generation is born at a club , which then becomes the core of a national side			1
@entity4 ’s identity became intertwined with @entity58 , a triumph for the @entity60			0
suddenly a country which had gone 44 years without winning a major trophy were beginning to look the business			1
six years ago @entity4 sliced a swathe through @entity65 and @entity66 with @entity67 at the helm			1
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , all young and hungry , were unstoppable			1
@entity73 were shoved aside in the quarter - finals on penalties , @entity76 in the semi , which left the mighty @entity78 standing in the way			1
@entity80 ! @entity71 scored a superb goal for the @entity28 against @entity82 in the @entity9 final @entity84 ! @entity69 smashed home an screaming winner against @entity24 in the 2010 @entity88 final @entity70 created the first - half opening for @entity71 with his chip and the @entity92 striker got the better of @entity93 to beat @entity94			1
a seismic shock went through world football			0
the @entity88 was a whole other ball game , though			0
once again @entity4 did not disappoint as they became the only @entity100 team to win the @entity102 trophy			0
@entity69 scored the extra time decider while @entity22 won the golden gloves for conceding just two goals and @entity106 won the silver boot			1
@entity58 were ruling in @entity108 and @entity21 and @entity4 were conquering the world thanks to the pass masters plus a heartbeat from inspirational defender @entity112 , he of the frizzy hair			0
the centre half could score a goal , too			0
remember the thumping header from @entity70 ’s corner which beat @entity82 in the semi-final in @entity10 ? two years ago @entity69 was voted player of the tournament at @entity11 as the @entity28 armada sailed through to their third consecutive title			1
bang ! defender @entity112 scored a thumping header against @entity82 in the 2010 semi-final it was glorious to watch			2
@entity72 ’s tricks , @entity130 ’s runs , @entity131 and @entity71 coming off the bench to score in the last few minutes of the final against @entity73			1
last season @entity58 ’s standards slipped			0
the mirror image that is the national team have been a shadow of themselves too			0
it ’s been a privilege , though			0
goalkeeper @entity22 , who made major errors in the two defeats , appeared heart - broken as he begged : ‘ we ask people ’s forgiveness			1
we are responsible but also the first ones to feel the pain			0
the exit was treated as a tragedy in the @entity28 media - @entity151 sports daily @entity153 's headline was " @entity154 - a lamentable end to a glorious era for @entity4 "			1
not up for it ? @entity158 admitted that the @entity28 players did n't have the hunger at the @entity88 @entity161 , formerly of @entity162 and now of @entity151 , also admitted that @entity4 were not hungry enough and too many players were unhappy			0
‘ i believe that we have n't been able to maintain the same levels of conviction , of hunger			0
the success , the happiness of before is gone , it 's run out and we have n't been able to keep it going			2
‘ it 's a completely unexpected failure but that is sport			2
it was unexpected but we have to take the great sadnesses in the same way as we take the great joys , as men			0
‘ it hurts our pride a lot , but this is football			0
but as i said , we 've known how to win and now we have to know how to lose			0
trouble : @entity4 were dumped out early of this month 's tournament over in @entity5 after two defeats ‘ we 've made lots of mistakes , we 've lost a bit of our know - how , and we 've paid for it with our solidity that had helped us win so many games			1
‘ eras end with defeats ... and this was a painful defeat			0
mentally we were n't ready , physically maybe the same but , putting that all together , we were n't in the best shape			0
' then we have played against teams that were well - prepared and at their peak , and now we 're going home			2
hopefully @entity4 can make it a send - off to savour , even if it is ultimately meaningless			2
@entity206 's team profile going into the @entity88			2

@entity209 's side were dumped out in @entity5 by @entity210
their tiki - taka *brilliance* should be remembered after wins in each of the last three major tournaments
@entity71 and @entity69 were unstoppable in previous years
captain @entity22 picked up trophies in 2008 , 2010 and 2012
