by @entity1 reporter with little signs of wear and tear , these kitsch , brightly coloured façades look like they could be straight of a period film set			0
but in fact they show what people in the @entity12 capital @entity13 have dubbed the ' millionaires ' ghost town ' : 42 acres of mock - 19th - century buildings that sit all but empty in the heart of the city			1
the development in @entity22 was conceived of a decade ago as a desirable , upmarket neighbourhood for the city 's wealthy residents			1
millionaires ' ghost town : the brightly coloured luxury development in @entity29 , in @entity13 , @entity12 , which has been left all but empty after the 2008 banking crash good as new : with little signs of wear and tear , these kitsch , brightly coloured façades look like they could be straight of a period film set @entity37 conceived : @entity22 consists of 42 acres of mock - 19th - century buildings that now sit all but empty in the heart of @entity13 historic : @entity22 was for centuries a centre for local cottage industries , inhabited by potters and skinners after whom many of its new streets are now named ... but the district 's prime location , 15 minutes from the centre of @entity13 , made it a prime target for developers keen to transform it into the playground of the rich then the banking crises of 2008 swept across the planet 's economies , plunging @entity12 into a particularly steep downturn and choking demand for luxury housing in @entity13			1
now @entity22 lies all but empty , just a fifth of its homes sold and its streets practically deserted save for curious city walkers , wedding photo sessions and the odd music video shoot			2
and those who have invested in properties in the development have been badly burned , with the price of an average flat there falling by nearly half since they went on the market			0
prior to the development , old @entity22 was for centuries a centre for local cottage industries , inhabited by potters and skinners after whom many of its new streets are now named			2
but the district 's prime location , less than a mile from the centre of the capital , made it a prime target for developers and a plan was hatched to transform it into the playground of the rich			2
plenty of space : now @entity22 lies all but empty , just a fifth of its homes sold and its streets practically deserted save for curious city walkers and few workmen just missing the tumble weed : those who have invested in the development have been badly burned , with the price of an average flat there falling by nearly half @entity106 , deputy head of @entity107 - 1 , the developers behind @entity22 , told @entity108 : ' we were knocked down in 2008			1
i will not hide that the demand dropped drastically then			0
' but he rejected descriptions , popular among locals , that the development is a ' dead town '			0
fifty of its 250 properties have residents , he said , with builders readying another 50 for new tenants			0
he added that he expects to sell the remaining 150 apartments by the end of 2014 , explaining the site 's lack of life with the claim that most owners live abroad and bought their properties as ' investments '			0
waiting for the upturn : an estate agent 's phone number is prominently displayed in the hope that some passer - by might be encouraged to rent or buy in the area low demand : just 50 of @entity22 's 250 properties are occupied , but @entity106 of developers @entity107 - 1 , says builders are readying 50 more for tenants good investment ? mr @entity106 accounts for the site 's lack of life with the claim that most owners live abroad and bought their properties as ' investments ' colourful : ironically , given the site cleared to make space for it , the @entity22 development apes the @entity153 and modernist architectural styles of 19th century @entity13 ' greed ' : @entity155 , one of @entity13 's most prominent architects , blames the developers for ruining the historic district and predicts it will never be fully inhabited shaky : mr @entity155 said that in their pursuit of profit developers threw caution to the wind , adding floors to their plans while disregarding the need to strenghten foundations not so comfortable ... the result has been a slew of complaints about cracks in the walls , leaky basements and heating breakdowns ever since people started moving in in 2010 pretty : in their proposal for the regeneration , @entity107 - 1 emphasised the district 's history and the luxury features they were to include on the up ? mr @entity106 claimed that initial problems have since been resolved and that a number of prominent @entity12 now have homes in the development however , their presence is yet to be felt in @entity191 , where builders and passers - by are more likely to be spotted than the cream of @entity13 's high society but the wisdom of investing in @entity22 has been challenged by one of @entity13 's most prominent architects , who blames the developers for ruining the historic district and predicts that it will never be fully inhabited			1
@entity155 said : ' there are building rules , common sense and there is also a greed which destroys them			0
' ironically , given the site cleared to make space for it , the @entity22 development apes the @entity153 and modernist architectural styles of @entity13			1
in their proposal for the regeneration , @entity107 - 1 emphasised the district 's history and the luxury features they were to include in the buildings and encourage in the community			1
architectural folly : garages face the luxury flats of @entity22 , but there is not a car - nor a soul - in sight dead end : demand for homes in the district dropped dramatically after the banking crisis , but the developers reject local descriptions of the area as a ' ghost town ' grand : a mansion house is seen with a banner - presumably advertising it for sale - strung across its imposing façade picturesque : the wisdom of investing in @entity22 has been challenged by one of @entity13 's most prominent architects , who blames the developers for ruining the historic district and predicts that it will never be fully inhabited but mr @entity155 said that in their pursuit of profit developers threw caution to the wind , adding floors to their plans while disregarding the need to strenghten foundations			1
the result has been a slew of complaints about cracks in the walls , leaky basements and heating breakdowns reported in local media ever since the first residents moved in three years ago			0
mr @entity106 told @entity108 that those problems have since been resolved and that a number of prominent @entity12 now have homes in the development			2
however , their presence is yet to be felt in @entity191 , where builders and passers - by are more likely to be spotted than the cream of @entity13 's high society			1
one man told the @entity108 how he likes to wander through the ' spacious and deserted area '			0
he added : ' people who have money for such apartments probably may find better places to live			0

@entity22 was conceived of as a desirable luxury community for @entity13 's high society
but the 2008 *financial* crisis choked demand for upmarket housing in the @entity12 capital
built in mock 19th - century style , it was ironically built over a *genuinely* historic neighbourhood
prominent architect slams developers and says their estate will never be fully occupied
