by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:36 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 09:06 est , 30 july 2012 the @entity3 cauldron was extinguished last night as the flame was relocated to another part of the stadium			1
the flame 's cauldron , a symbol of the @entity3 movement , is supposed to burn for the entirety of the @entity12 but organisers have confirmed it was put out temporarily so the 28ft high structure could be moved to the edge of the stadium			1
this revelation will add to controversy about the location of the flame , which is only visible to those who have tickets to events in the main stadium			1
the @entity3 cauldron after the flame had been extinguished last night			1
it was put out about 9pm and re-lit in its new position at 7.50am this morning @entity31 chairman @entity30 said last night that the cauldron was ' not created to be a tourist attraction ' and would not go on public view			1
the steel and copper @entity36 - designed cauldron was lit by seven young athletes at the opening ceremony on friday , at the culmination of a 70 - day torch relay which covered 8,000 miles and all corners of @entity44			2
it was extinguished at 9pm last night and re-lit at 7.50am this morning , after the flame was kept burning in a miners ' lamp overnight			2
it will take 80 hours to ready the stadium for athletics events			2
it now stands at the southern end of the stadium , ahead of the finish line for the 100m and in the same place where a giant bell marked the start of the @entity60			2
@entity61 , director of communications for the organising committee , said : ' the cauldron has been put out while we move it to another part of the stadium			1
' she added that the flame would be kept burning in a lantern , also used during parts of the torch relay , and the cauldron relit on monday morning			1
giant cranes move in to move the cauldron from the centre of the @entity76 , where it was lit during friday night 's @entity60 the decision to have the cauldron inside the stadium for the duration of the @entity12 is controversial , with organisers saying it is not designed to be a ' tourist attraction ' it was nearly midnight when the cranes moved into position to move to cauldron @entity88 , 82 , re-lit the cauldron on monday with the aid of a cherry picker the honour went to 82 - year - old @entity88 from @entity93 in @entity94 , who was a torchbearer at the 1948 @entity12			1
back then , he ran 1.8 miles with the flame through @entity97 , but here he was aided by a cherry picker			1
mr @entity88 described his role as an ' honour ' , adding : ' when i ran with the @entity103 in @entity97 i never thought i would get this close to the @entity105 , it brought me to tears when it lit up			1
' it will be an incredible inspiration to the competing athletes here at the heart of the @entity111 in the @entity112			0
' it is not the first time the cauldron has been concealed from public view			0
it was not open to the public in 1948 , the last time the @entity12 were staged in @entity119			1
the new position of the cauldron will ensure track and field athletics events can take place in the stadium the @entity3 cauldron is lit during friday night 's @entity60			2
the 28ft high cauldron is made up of 204 engraved leaves to represent each of nations participating at the @entity12 and a fierce row erupted at the @entity131 when organisers fenced off the cauldron and positioned security guards in front of it , preventing large numbers of visitors a look at it			1
after a backlash from @entity143 , officials were forced to remove some of the protection and allow more visitor - friendly access			0
the cauldron is made up of 204 steel pipes and individually designed copper petals inscribed with each country 's name			0
its designer mr @entity36 said : ' there is the precedent of the @entity155 of the cauldron set within the stadium , to one side with the spectators , and with the technology we now have that did nâ€™t exist in 1948 it can be shared with everyone in the @entity111 with screens			2
' we felt that sharing it with the screens reinforced the intimacy within it			0
if it had been a huge beacon lifted up in the air it would have had to be bigger , and would have somehow not met the brief that we discussed with @entity174 of making something that was rooted in where the people are			0
' the cauldron is to be dismantled after the @entity12 and each of the copper petals will be returned to the competing 204 @entity181 to keep			1
in the last @entity12 in 1948 , the flame was kept burning inside @entity112 for the whole of the @entity12 the flame burned high above the stadium at the @entity186 in @entity187 a bird 's eye view of the @entity111 taken for @entity189			1
the aerial imagery of the @entity111 in @entity191 , @entity119 was updated by @entity192 just before the @entity60 day three of the @entity12 started in perfect fashion for @entity44 as @entity194 ( front ) and @entity196 won their heat of the double sculls in an @entity200 time			2
the double world champions set a time of six minutes 44.33 seconds , smashing the previous record by five seconds			0
@entity194 and @entity196 , who are the clear favourites for a gold medal , are now unbeaten in 22 races			0
@entity194 has three consecutive @entity3 silver medals , but on this form , she is likely to be on top of the podium at @entity211 after the final on friday the @entity214 men 's eight qualified for their final after holding off the challenge of @entity143 , @entity217 and @entity218 in this morning 's repechage			0
the crew , who have only been training together for six weeks after a member withdrew through injury , quickly opened up a commanding lead over reigning @entity3 champions @entity143			0
their challengers closed the gap but @entity44 maintained a high stroke rate to earn their spot in wednesday 's final @entity231 set a new @entity214 record for the weightlifting clean and jerk today , though her effort of 121kg is unlikely to win her a medal			0
the 18 - year - old from @entity238 fell narrowly short of her personal best in the snatch portion of the event , registering 90kg			0
but , roared on by an electric home crowd , she redemmed herself in the clean and jerk for an overall total of 211kg			0
however , the elite lifters in the @entity247 are likely to eclipse her current standing of second .			0
