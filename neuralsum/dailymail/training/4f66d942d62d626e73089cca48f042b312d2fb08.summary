' i could never imagine how or why i would be asked to have to do this , ' @entity6 says of the deaths			0

' i open it a little bit every day and i have my little bit of sad time and crying and whatever i need to do			0
then i shut that box … i do n’t have to throw it open and cope with it all right now , ' she says			0
' i ’ll carry that box forever			0
