there are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world – enough to kill everyone on the planet 100 times over			1
now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads			1
they include the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22			1
between them , these nations possess 10,000 nuclear warheads , 4,100 of which are active			1

now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads the latest infographic uses data from the ' @entity39 ' , which since 1987 has tracked the number and type of the world 's nuclear arsenals			1
' i do n't think people truly understand just how many of these weapons there are in the world , ' said @entity49 , executive director of the @entity50 , who publishes the notebook			0
' the interactive is a way to see , immediately , who has nuclear weapons and when they got them , and how those numbers relate to each other			2
' it is a startling experience , looking at those comparisons			0
' @entity16 and the @entity14 have most nuclear weapons , followed by the @entity15 and @entity17 , according to the graphic			1
it creators , @entity65 and @entity66 , from the @entity67 say that in the past , host countries have learned of foreign nuclear weapons on their soil from the @entity39			1
the left image shows a pock - marked landscape which is the the result of decades of nuclear weapons testing in the @entity75 desert			2
there are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world – enough to kill everyone in on the planet 100 times over			1
pictured on the right is a mushroom cloud rising above the @entity75 desert in 1953 ' for instance , @entity84 - which was the target of two atomic bomb attacks and has a law against nuclear weapons on its territory - learned from the notebook that there were @entity14 nuclear weapons on @entity94 and @entity95 , ' the authors write			1
' [ it also learned ] about an enormous and varied @entity14 nuclear arsenal on @entity98 , @entity14 nuclear bombs stored on the mainland at @entity102 and @entity103 air bases , and nuclear - armed @entity105 ships stationed in @entity106 and @entity107			1
' data for the @entity14 on the interactive map has been compiled using declassified documents from the @entity14 government , many of which were obtained using @entity115 requests			2
they combined this with figures from congressional hearings , specialty magazines , and confidential sources			0
' creating estimates for other nuclear - armed states can be more challenging because not all provide as much information as the @entity14 , ' the authors write			0
for instance , @entity15 and @entity17 have published some information about their arsenals , but much is still unavailable			2
a self - propelled suface to air missile during a drill shown in a @entity22 drill @entity22 appears poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020 , @entity14 researchers warned last week			2
and cutting - edge @entity139 companies could be unwittingly contributing to @entity141 's suspect nuclear program with their equipment diverted to the isolated country via @entity18 , they said			2
unveiling the first results of what will be a 15 - month study , @entity144 , senior fellow at the @entity14 - @entity145 at @entity146 , said some of their conclusions were very ' disturbing			0
' using satellite imagery , @entity22 media reports and their deep knowledge of nuclear programs , @entity157 , and veteran nuclear non-proliferation expert @entity159 , have drawn up three possible scenarios based on the progress that @entity141 from 2009 to 2014			0
in the first scenario , @entity141 would almost double its stockpile to about 20 weapons , including plutonium - based weapons which have been miniaturized sufficiently to be mounted on its @entity167 - class medium - range ballistic missile , capable of reaching @entity84			0
in the second - and most likely scenario - @entity22 continues its current trajectory and manages to produce 50 weapons by 2020			0
it would also make significant advances in miniaturisation technology enabling it to mount warheads on intermediate - range ballistic missiles			0
in what wit dubbed ' the worst case scenario , ' the @entity22 stockpile would grow more rapidly to 100 weapons and make ' significant advances ' in weapons designs to enable it to potentially deploy battlefield and tactical weapons			2
for @entity16 and the remaining nuclear - armed , estimates rely on information from @entity189 intelligence organisations , expert studies , news media reports , and satellite imagery			0
since the @entity14 unleashed the first nuclear bombs on @entity195 and @entity196 back in 1945 there have been a staggering 2056 nuclear tests recorded worldwide			0
it took almost a year until the next substantial tests took place but by the mid- 50s and 60s , nuclear experiments were being recorded across the globe on almost a monthly basis			0
the threat of nuclear war that once hung over the world has eased since the @entity207 amid sharp reductions in warheads but @entity16 and the @entity14 , @entity211 's main military power , retain massively destructive nuclear arsenals			1
earlier this month @entity211 officials said @entity16 's nuclear strategy appears to point to a lowering of the threshold for using nuclear weapons in any conflict			1
meanwhile a separate report found that @entity22 is poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020			0
unveiling the first results of what will be a 15 - month study , @entity144 , senior fellow at the @entity14 - @entity145 at @entity146 , said some of their conclusions were very ' disturbing			0
' although the @entity22 's nuclear program remains shrouded in uncertainty , @entity141 is currently believed to have a stockpile of some 10 to 16 nuclear weapons fashioned from either plutonium or weapons - grade uranium .			1

it reveals stockpile changes in the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22
between them these countries have 10,000 nuclear weapons , around 4,100 of which are believed to be active
