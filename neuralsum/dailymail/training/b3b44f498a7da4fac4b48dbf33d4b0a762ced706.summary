the 28 - year - old has been a late bloomer on the international stage and - having been fondly known as the @entity34 during his school days - reveals he had to develop an abrasive edginess to ensure that his oversized frame can fulfil its destructive potential			2
‘ people used to say i was n’t mean enough and i would just roll with the punches , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i was always the @entity34 as a teenager			2
i was n’t someone to throw my weight around			2
it ’s not like i ’ve suddenly developed a mean streak , but i ’ve had to work on that ability to physically dominate my opponent			2
i ’ve had my fair share of critics and i ’ve had to develop that edge			2

‘ i was 6ft by the time i was 11 and there have always been nicknames - it was @entity106 at college			0
but no - one ever bullied me and i did n’t bully anyone either , it was just one of those things			0
when you ’re around 13 or 14 there was that typical teenage awkwardness because you would stand out and be a bit self - conscious , but you get used to it			0
i was fat as well - one of my other nicknames was chunky ! ’ @entity0 ’s father works in shipping and his mother was previously employed by @entity120			1

@entity128 has been hailed as the brains behind @entity5 ’s resurgence and , according to @entity0 , there is no one better in the business			1
‘ he ’s one of the best coaches in the world , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ his attention to detail is phenomenal and every little thing has to be spot on			0
after we lost to @entity145 ( in 2013 ) , he went back through the whole thing and picked apart every detail			0
there was a missed tackle here , or an unnecessary man in the ruck there that compromised the defensive line			0
he stopped it at every point - he has the video analysts working some pretty long hours			0
’ @entity0 has hailed @entity5 coach @entity128 ( right ) as ' one of the best in the world ' @entity0 cites @entity128 's attention to detail as a key factor in @entity5 's resurgence in the sport @entity128 's arrival has seen @entity0 become a regular starter in the @entity5 setup over the last 12 months @entity128 ’s appointment as @entity5 coach ties in with @entity0 ’s resurgence in the test arena			1

@entity0 fits into @entity128 ’s vision and reveals how the @entity182 has changed the ethos at the @entity7 - based camps			1
‘ he ’s very consumed with rugby and winning , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve never really been for a beer with him but he puts a huge amount of hours into his job and he ’s very , very focused in that way			0
there ’s been a bit of a shift in mentality since he took over			0
‘ before you might hear stories about some of the lads being worse for wear on a monday morning , but if you ’re not 100 per cent now then you ’re pretty much out of the team			0
’ @entity0 is confident @entity5 will earn a positive result against @entity203 then they meet in @entity7 on march 1 like a fine wine , @entity0 has reached an age where there are far less doubts about his place in the starting xv			1

‘ but your goal is obviously to win every game			0
@entity203 are an exciting young team and they have some lads making a name for themselves			2
