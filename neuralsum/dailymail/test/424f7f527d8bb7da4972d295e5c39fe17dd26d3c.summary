@entity0 has revealed how he came within a heartbeat of stepping down from his job at @entity4 as the @entity6 controversy went into overdrive this week			1
the @entity4 boss says he felt so repulsed by the gut - wrenching predicament being endured by his young defender - before he was dramatically cleared - that he was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves , just weeks before an historic @entity14 date			1
@entity15 cyclist @entity0 set off on a lonely bike ride after hearing @entity6 had been cited for the handball missed by officials in the semi-final against @entity20 , and admits his head was in a spin over an affair that has dominated the back - page headlines since last sunday			1
@entity4 defender @entity6 will be allowed to appear in @entity14 final after his ban was dismissed only messages of support awaiting him on his return from footballing friends brought him back from the brink of quitting			1
@entity0 , who lives in the @entity33 just north of @entity4 , said : ‘ i came in here this morning after a day off			1
i turned my phone off and was away myself , away out on the bike with plenty of thinking time : a great freedom of mind			1
‘ i was that sick of what has been going on in @entity44 football i was seriously contemplating my own future			1
i ’m serious when i say that			1
‘ i had just had it up to here and was ready to just give it up			2
if it was n’t for what happened when i turned my phone back on , with the phone calls and texts i received from people i really value in football , that my spirits picked up again			2
‘ the calls and texts came in from all over the place , from some of the highest levels across the game			1
i ’ve had phone calls that have really got me back on my feet			2
‘ i would n’t like to name them all , but there were a lot of good people and a good few close friends in the football fraternity			2
@entity6 was not sent off and no penalty was given as @entity4 went on to beat @entity20 3 - 2 after extra-time ‘ they were saying : “ you need to lead from the front , you need to fight it			1
” that restored and galvanised that focus and drive in me			2
and , if that was how i was feeling , how was the boy @entity6 feeling ? it should never have come to this			1
’ @entity6 was cleared to play in the final by the @entity84 yesterday , but @entity0 insists this ‘ unprecedented ’ @entity86 wrangle must be the catalyst for change in @entity44 football ’s governance			1
although those who sit on the panel are drawn from many walks of life , ranging from former players and coaches to ex-refs and members of the legal profession , @entity0 said he wants ‘ real football people ’ drafted in instead of the ‘ suits ’ he claims lack understanding of the nuances and spirit of the professional game			1
and he seemed to point a thinly - veiled finger of accusation at @entity86 chief executive @entity108 by alleging that compliance officer @entity109 was a mere ‘ patsy ’ in the process			1
overwhelmed by a huge upswell of support for @entity6 , he said : ‘ no disrespect to those sitting on [ the judicial panel ] , but you need football guys and that ’s where it ’s flawed			1
that ’s why i promised myself i ’d never go back down there until that gets sorted out			2
‘ the last time i appeared was when i was down at @entity124			2
you have to be qualified in what you ’re judging on			2
there ’s no one better qualified than ex-players and ex-coaches			2
for some reason the @entity86 do n’t want to go down that line			2
why ? ‘ i could n’t tell you who i sat in front of while at @entity124 , but they weren ’ t football people			2
i ’m talking about playing the game , managing the game , coaching the game			1
@entity0 was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves ‘ there are hundreds of these guys i ’m quite sure would go in there and do it , for the sake of football			2
we need to use this to make sure the whole process work better			0
@entity6 ’s case was unprecedented			1
how was that ? somebody needs to explain that to me			0
‘ i know the verdict has gone in our favour but i do n’t think this is finished			0
we need to sit down and look at the @entity84 process			0
‘ i do n’t believe in the @entity84			0
i promised myself a couple of years ago i wouldn ’ t walk back into @entity161 until it changes			0
i would never question their integrity but i want football people sitting in judgment			0
‘ they are making a football decision and i want football people			1
look at what is at stake			0
here we were talking about a young player ’s chance of playing in a @entity14 final			1
i ’d be more confident with football people because they know the game			1
‘ the compliance officer is damned if he does , damned if does n’t			0
is he getting used as a patsy in all this ? i honestly do n’t know			0
‘ how far do you take it ? we ’re opening a whole can of worms here			0
we had a strong claim for a penalty when the goalkeeper comes through the back of @entity184			0
where do you draw the line ? ‘ it ’s unheard of , but i honestly think there ’s a little bit more to it			0
we can use this whole episode to make it better			0
’ @entity0 , who accepted @entity6 would have warranted a red card had the ref spotted the offence , refused to point a finger of blame at former club @entity20 for the letter of complaint they wrote to the @entity86 in the aftermath			1
‘ @entity20 keep getting flung into it , but i came in here this morning and all @entity203 , our receptionist , says to me is that the phone had never stopped ringing with @entity20 supporters wishing @entity6 all the best and hoping he plays in the final			1
‘ i believe that comes right from the top at @entity20			1
they conduct themselves in a great manner			0
i had the privilege to play for that club and everything they do is class			0
‘ what i will say is , in @entity44 , we put people up on a pedestal			0
and we love knocking them down again			0
‘ but see when there has been an injustice , one thing we do in @entity44 is show a real solidarity to make sure we get it right			0
‘ that ’s what i ’m finding about the whole of @entity44 football in the reaction to this			0
there ’s a real coming together as they all recognise this is not right			0
‘ i have to be the voice of @entity4			1
i ’m not really saying [ all ] that i really want to say			0
i ’m trying to be calculated and honest			0
i think there ’s more to say			0
there ’s more to it			0
