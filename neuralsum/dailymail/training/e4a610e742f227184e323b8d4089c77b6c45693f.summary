june 14 : @entity0 , 8pm , @entity1 june 19 : @entity2 , 8pm , @entity3 june 24 : @entity4 , 5pm , @entity5 follow all the action on @entity7 @entity8 has had keyhole surgery on his knee and is expected to recover in time for the @entity11 , says his mother			1
@entity13 said the surgery was successful and that he is expected to recover in two - three weeks , which means he would be able to line up against @entity2			1
' the surgery is over and thank @entity17 everything went well			0
what @entity8 had was n't as serious as we thought , ' she said on her son 's injury			1
@entity24 , who allege @entity8 picked up the injury during @entity28 's final game of the @entity30 season , remain confident he will be involved on june 19			1
@entity31 understands that the country 's football officials believe the 27 - year - old is unlikely to be fit for the @entity11 opener against @entity0 , but that he could play five days later			1
out ? @entity8 is touch and go for the @entity11 after it was revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury race against time : @entity8 is unlikely to be fit for @entity24 's first @entity11 match against @entity0 but @entity24 @entity42 president @entity41 suggested if @entity8 's recovery went to plan he could return to training in just over a fortnight			1
' we know the surgery was a success and that the injury is not serious			2
we have to wait and see how he recovers , ' he told @entity51 newspaper @entity50			2
" we had very little time to react and without knowing the extent of the injury , we did n't want to raise the alarm to the public			0
' these are injuries that , considering @entity8 's fitness and if the recovery is good , will not take long for him to return to play			1
' we have to calculate if he will arrive for the first , second of third ( group game at the @entity11 )			2
' we know that normally the recovery period , if all goes well , is around 15 days to return to training			0
' we all know what @entity8 represents to the national team and more so , considering the great form he was in			2
' considering how valuable he is to the national team , it is a big concern for us			0
' @entity8 , who was named the @entity67 and @entity69 player of the year after scoring 31 league goals , is his country 's all - time leading scorer with 39 in 77 appearances			1
he picked up the injury in training and , following the meniscus surgery , the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the sidelines			1
@entity8 's sister @entity80 said her brother began feeling an uncomfortable pain during his last @entity30 game and it returned during his first day of training with the @entity51 national team on wednesday			1
it 's your time again : @entity88 is set to become even more involved in the @entity24 frontline this summer knock : the @entity28 striker picked up the injury on wednesday and was immediately sent for an mri scan upset : the 27 - year - old is having meniscus surgery on thursday and could miss up to six weeks main man : @entity97 's @entity96 will have the task of firing the @entity99 to glory @entity8 : ( 77 caps , 38 goals ) @entity96 : ( 60 caps , 20 goals ) @entity88 : ( 107 caps , 36 goals ) @entity107 : ( 66 caps , 13 goals ) @entity110 : ( 11 caps , 7 goals ) however , she believes the @entity28 star will be ready for the @entity11			1
' the problem is that these days he wo n't be able to play , and will only be able to do physiotherapy , ' she said			0
' he underwent a magnetic resonance and it came out that he had to undergo surgery			0
' on the injury , an @entity24 @entity42 official said : ‘ it was all unexpected			1
the latest information is that we are deciding what to do , but there are increased possibilities ( involving surgery )			0
' i ca n’t tell you anything more			0
the @entity134 ( @entity135 ) will announce it officially on thursday morning			0
’ @entity8 was checked over by medical staff on wednesday after picking up the knock in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in @entity139			1
with the final 23 - man @entity11 squad needed to be ratified on june 2 , it leaves @entity24 with very little wriggle room			1
any decision to include @entity8 - not match fit - would still represent a sizeable risk			1
they wo n't be encouraged to know that @entity147 underwent meniscus surgery prior to the @entity149 in april and did n't play his first game for seven weeks			1
should @entity8 be out for longer , it would heavily impact on @entity28 's start to the next campaign			1
the @entity154 are aware of the injury but have n't been officially informed			0
the 27 - year - old arrived in @entity157 for training on tuesday morning , feeling discomfort in a session with @entity162 's squad on wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem later in the evening			2
@entity164 , executive of the @entity134 , confirmed that they had attempted to keep the news under wraps			0
golden boot : @entity8 was the @entity30 top scorer and won the @entity169 award developments heap more pressure on @entity97 's @entity96 , who will lead the line when they face @entity0 on june 14			1
veteran @entity88 - so impressive in @entity173 four years ago - was expected to play a bit - part role but may now be needed alongside @entity96			1
they do still have other options , with @entity177 's @entity107 and @entity178 's @entity110 waiting in the wings			1
since @entity8 signed for @entity28 in january 2011 , he has not missed a single match because of fitness issues and has been regularly hailed by his team - mates and manager for his extraordinary durability and determination – he will always make himself available for training , even if he is carrying the type of slight tweak that would convince others to spend time in the medical room			1
should @entity8 be prevented from leading the 2010 semi-finalists in @entity139 , he would be left distraught			1
the last time there was a major tournament in @entity99 , the 27 - year - old was the star of the show as @entity24 won the @entity197 in 2011			1
1987 : born january 24 in @entity198 , @entity24			2
