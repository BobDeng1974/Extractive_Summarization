by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity2 claims it would not be a failure if his @entity6 team finish second , despite being title favourites and having spent £ 75million in the transfer market			1
@entity2 derided @entity9 as a ‘ specialist in failure ’ last season , referring to the @entity14 manager ’s nine years without a trophy , which finally ended in may when @entity14 won the @entity16			1
but the @entity17 seems to have softened his tone for this season , saying : ‘ it ’s the only league in the world where four , five or six clubs are title contenders			2
do the other five fail ? i do n’t think so			0
another view is that three , four or five did fantastically but only one won			0
’ @entity6 open their season at @entity37 against @entity32 on monday and @entity2 added : ‘ i can do nothing more than say : “ we feel we are title contenders			1
” the only thing i can add is that probably , if you ask every manager in the @entity42 are you a title contender , probably four , five or six will tell you , “ yes			1
” @entity6 owner @entity46 and the @entity48 board expect @entity2 to challenge for the title			1
but they seem to have a greater understanding of the increased competitiveness of the @entity42 and appreciate that winning the league is more difficult than ever			2
@entity2 is the only manager in the @entity46 era to have kept his job despite not having won a trophy at the end of the season , @entity54 and @entity55 being the two previous incumbents sacked for that failing			1
but despite their heavy spending , @entity6 have balanced the books this summer , selling @entity65 for £ 50m , @entity66 for £ 28m and @entity67 for £ 4.7m			2
and @entity2 said : ‘ if the team finishing first is better than us — if we are very good but somebody is better than us — that ’s football			2
that ’s not a failure			0
the only thing you can do is be good			0
‘ we have to be good , we have to better than last season as a team , the quality of our game , in everything we have to be better			0
‘ we have to fight for the title and after that if somebody is really better than us , it ’s because they were fantastic			0
’ high - profile departures : @entity65 is one of several players who have been allowed to leave @entity48			0

the @entity6 manager believes up to six teams are competing for the title
