by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ as @entity3 prepare to take on @entity4 in the @entity5 semi-final on tuesday evening , they do so deprived of the services of their talisman @entity8 and shorn of the attacking spark so readily associated with the country ’s brand of football			1
in @entity8 , 's absence the burden passes to the underwhelming @entity16 , notable only for his anglicised name and the increasingly exasperating @entity18			1
it begs the question as to just what has happened to a country famed for attacking brilliance			0
here , @entity24 charts the alarming decline of several celebrated names that should , really , have been destined to play a major part in @entity3 …			1
a precocious talent of extraordinary ability , he drew comparisons with the great @entity46 and broke @entity48 ’s record as the youngest goal scorer in a @entity51 competition as a 17 - year - old			0
he earned a move to @entity55 giants @entity54 and then the problems began			0
@entity54 ’s medical experts attributed his series of injuries to a growth spurt , but his party - going exploits caused equal measures of anxiety			0
things started well , with the forward scoring 48 goals in his first 105 appearances but a high - profile relationship with the daughter of @entity70 exposed @entity29 to the glare of the paparazzi , with the couple playing to the hype and relishing the publicity			1
forgotten man : @entity29 celebrates a goal for @entity3 against the @entity78 less than four years ago return to @entity79 ? @entity29 has been playing for @entity80 but might be on his way back to @entity54 with @entity82 it was even alleged that she personally put a block on a move to @entity87 - out of love - after his form had begun to suffer			1
eventually , after making just 15 @entity91 appearances in his final two years at the @entity92 , he returned to @entity93 in january 2013			0
his time at @entity93 was scarred by poor form and violence and now aged 24 , a return to @entity79 with @entity82 may be on the cards this summer as he seeks to resuscitate his career			0
difficulties : @entity29 was seen as the next world class @entity3 striker but he suffered with injuries in @entity54 @entity30 caps : 87 , goals : 29 still only 32 , @entity30 , the @entity106 remains an immensely popular figure in @entity3 , with 20,000 supporters gathering at the @entity109 to welcome him back to @entity80 earlier this month			1
@entity30 , such a magnificent talent for @entity54 as the @entity54 won the @entity111 in 2007 , saw his career stagnate after a sensational £ 56million move to @entity114 , mostly due a serious injury to his left knee			2
playmaker : the one - time world player of the year was @entity3 's big hope in 2010 but they flopped home from home : @entity30 was back with @entity54 last season but now is heading for @entity3 and then the @entity123 video no ill - felings over @entity3 snub - @entity30 four years on , he re-joined @entity54 on a free transfer last summer			1
he netted seven times last season but was unable to win over @entity127 on the occasions that the @entity37 manager came to @entity55 to assess his performances			2
@entity30 is now heading to the @entity123 with @entity131 - via a loan move to his very first club @entity80			0
disappointment : his form in @entity55 earned a £ 65million move to @entity114 but he struggled in @entity136 @entity31 caps : 92 , goals : 27 the boy wonder that once led one @entity136 newspaper to declare : ‘ and @entity141 created @entity31 ! ’ is now 30 - years - old			0
there has never been a doubt over @entity31 natural talent and the show - pony step - overs and shimmies represent all that the @entity37 adore about the game			0
his application , however , brings his ability into question			0
he left both @entity152 and @entity153 exasperated during his time with @entity155 , even if there were occasions when training would be paused so @entity155 ’s young stars could applaud the latest moment of extraordinary inspiration by the @entity37			2
outsider : @entity31 had been tipped by some for a place in @entity127 's squad but he was eventually left out up there with the best : the @entity3 trickster holds off @entity168 during a @entity111 game after scoring just six goals in his last two season with @entity54 , one of the brightest sparks from @entity3 ’s disappointing 2010 @entity5 was omitted by @entity127			1
quite simply , the 2014 incarnation of the @entity3 , characterised by their high intensity and highly disciplined game - plans , do not make allowances for luxury passengers			2
a move for @entity78 awaits			0
trend setter : @entity31 was the first of the big money signings for @entity155 but he was frustrating and what about @entity32 ? caps : 1 , goals : 0 the @entity190 playmaker was a surprise omission to most observers that have watched @entity32 ’s glittering performances at @entity195 in the last twelve months			0
and that perception has only been amplified by the shoddy showings produced by @entity18 from the left wing in @entity3			1
potential : @entity32 played alongside @entity199 in @entity3 's successful 2011 @entity201 campaign club form : @entity32 was brilliant for @entity203 ' @entity190 as they finish second in the @entity204 @entity127 opted for @entity18 and @entity206 pair @entity199 and @entity207 ahead of @entity32 and it is perhaps this decision that looks the most questionable as @entity3 toil in the absence of their traditional flair at this @entity5			1
@entity32 ’s ability to produce an eye - of - the - needle pass and counter attack with pace and quality would have been a useful addition to @entity3 ’s forward line but at the age of 22 , he still has time to break into his national squad in the coming years			2
missing link : it seems @entity32 's late - season @entity190 form was not enough to impress @entity127			1

those three @entity3 stars plus @entity29 were all left out by @entity127
@entity3 go into their semi final with @entity3 without the usual attacking flair
@entity8 's injury leaves just @entity16 and @entity18 as the hosts ' main *threats*
could the @entity3 have benefited from those left out ?
