he was concerned after noticing she was suffering from severe pain in her side			1
@entity8 , 22 , was diagnosed with a tumour on her pancreas after @entity13 insisted that she went to see a doctor about a pain in her side miss @entity8 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ‘ i thought the pain was due to muscle strain			1
i was working at a supermarket and was doing a fair amount of heavy lifting at the time			0
‘ me and @entity13 were in a car together when i put the seat back and involuntarily yelped out in pain			1
‘ he became very concerned and asked what was wrong			0
i told him it was probably nothing but he said , “ no , you have to go to see a doctor ”			2
‘ i did n't want to be thought of as a hypochondriac so was ready to brush it aside , but @entity13 being so insistent made me change my mind and i booked an appointment			1
’ miss @entity8 visited her gp in january 2009 and was sent for an urgent ultrasound scan			1
she said : ‘ at first we thought it was kidney stones			1
@entity13 came with me to the scan for support			1
‘ the doctor phoned me with the results before i went to work			2
i knew straight away that something serious was going on - the doctor does n't usually call you directly			1
’ ms @entity8 was not intending to see a doctor about the pain as she thought it was caused by a strained muscle she had suffered while working in a supermarket ms @entity8 ( pictured with her father , @entity58 , in hospital ) had to have surgery to remove the precancerous tumour the ultrasound revealed an alarming growth suggesting a cancerous or pre-cancerous tumour on her pancreas			1
it is rare for teenagers to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , which is often fatal			0
a month after the growth was revealed , @entity70 and mr @entity13 , 27 , became engaged during a visit to @entity72			1
she said : ‘ i asked him to marry me on the beach by writing the words in the sand			0
he wrote “ yes ” and then took me to the end of the pier , where he got down on one knee and asked me back			0
‘ when we met , it took just two hours for me to realise i wanted to be with him			0
we both love @entity83 - especially the songs “ @entity84 ” and “ @entity86 ” , which has become our song			0
’ ms @entity8 no longer has any signs of the tumour in her body but she still has to go for check ups every year ms @entity8 spent a month in hospital recovering from her operation			1
picture shows her 18 - inch scar after several nervous months of further tests , ms @entity8 underwent surgery just days after her 18th birthday in july 2009			1
she said : ‘ i signed all the consent forms in a state of disbelief and shock			0
it was difficult to understand what was happening to me			0
they removed the growth , but were sufficiently worried to remove my spleen too			1
’ miraculously , the growth was judged to be precancerous and there were no signs of the cancer spreading to any other part of her body			2
the realisation of how precarious her position had been only dawned on her as she lay in hospital for a month recovering from the operation			0
ms @entity8 said : ' i signed all the consent forms in a state of disbelief and shock			2
it was difficult to understand what was happening to me			0
they removed the growth , but were sufficiently worried to remove my spleen too ' she said : ‘ it suddenly dawned on me how serious things were			1
the tumour had grown really quickly and had i left it any longer the surgeons probably would n't have been able to do anything about it			2
‘ i was shocked and broke down in tears , but @entity13 did a really good job looking after me			2
’ mr @entity13 , who works at a bowling alley in @entity135 , said : ‘ looking back i 'm so glad i was so insistent that @entity8 went to the doctor			1
even though we 'd only just met , i was very worried about her			0
pancreatic cancer is notoriously hard to diagnose as it rarely causes symptoms in the early stages			0
symptoms do not tend to develop until the cancer is advanced			0
the first symptoms can include pain in the upper abdomen , unexpected weight loss and loss of appetite , jaundice , diabetes , nausea and vomiting			2
source : @entity155 ‘ it was very difficult to see @entity8 suffering through the diagnosis and the surgery , but i stayed supportive , and i always will be supportive			1
’ ms @entity8 , who now requires annual cancer scans , said she is looking forward to enjoying a happy , healthy life with her fiancé			1
she said : ‘ we 're trying to have children and i 'm on medication to help us along with that			0
we 'll get married as soon as we can , but we do n't know when that will be yet			2

she said : ‘ some people feel as though they ca n't talk to their families and i know how hard that can be			2
‘ i 'm here to talk to people if they want			0

@entity8 thought the pain in her side was caused by a muscle strain
@entity13 heard her yelp in pain and said she should see a doctor
doctors *initially* thought she had kidney stones but an ultrasound scan revealed a precancerous growth the size of a satsuma on her pancreas
she had surgery to remove the growth as well as her spleen
the tumour had n't spread but she now has to have annual check ups
