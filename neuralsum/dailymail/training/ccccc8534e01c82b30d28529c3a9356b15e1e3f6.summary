@entity0 was left rueing a series of missed chances as he went out of the @entity3 after giving the seeded @entity5 @entity4 a first round scare			1
the @entity8 @entity7 outplayed @entity4 for spells but could never quite drive home the advantage in going down 2 - 6 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 in a shade under two and three quarter hours			1
with @entity15 and @entity16 also falling , it meant that @entity17 was left in isolation as the sole @entity19 singles representative by the middle of the second afternoon at @entity21			1
@entity0 gave @entity4 a scare but ultimately could not get the win he craved @entity0 took the opening set against @entity4 but lost the next three @entity4 celebrates his win over the @entity8 no 2 in the opening round of the @entity3 @entity0 did enough to show the improvements he has been adding to his game , but at this rarefied level – the first time he has been in a @entity33 main draw by right – there was a reminder that you have to take your opportunities when they come			1
covering the court well and often giving as good as he got in the rallies , the 27 year - old @entity38 pounced on a slow start from the former top ten player and then had a break point in the opening game of the second set			1
he recovered from the ensuing landslide to lead 4 - 2 in the third set , moving the powerful lefthander around to stop him teeing off with his renowned forehand too much			2
@entity0 reflects on a number of missed opportunities as he went out of the @entity3 in the first round @entity4 and @entity0 shake hands at the end of their four set match but @entity0 , who knows @entity4 well from his days training in @entity58 , got pegged back from leading at 3 - 0 in the tiebreak			1
he forced a set point at 6 - 5 in the breaker but could only play a viciously kicking first serve long , then had an ace pumped past him before missing a backhand to concede the set			1
while he is undoubtedly on the up , it is the playing of the biggest points that so often separates the accomplished rank - and - file from the likes of @entity4 , who has been a semi-finalist here			2
in the fourth set the @entity5 got ahead immediately with a break and never let up from there			0
defeat against a player ranked seventy places above him leaves @entity0 still only on the cusp of the world 's top 100 , a mark he hopes to breach in the next month			2
both players produced some high quality tennis , and it was to @entity0 's credit that he was so competitive , especially as he revealed afterwards that he has been coping with a family bereavement			0
' it was a pretty good level and he said that to me afterwards			0
he produced at the big moments , but he 's going away thinking that if he plays me again this year it wo n't be easy for him			0
i 'm working hard and i 'm stronger and fast than i 've ever been			0
' my grandmother passed away five days ago , i saw her over @entity87 and it 's been tough as we are a close family			0
i am going home for the funeral next week , at the moment that is the priority			0
i do n't know what i will do the next couple of weeks but then i plan to play in @entity96 and @entity97 before the @entity98			0
' @entity0 looks sure to be the second singles player behind @entity17 for the @entity98 first round tie against the @entity101 in @entity102 in early march			1
@entity17 returns to the @entity103 for his second round match against @entity105 that will take place in the early hours of the morning @entity8 time .			2

@entity4 beats @entity0 2 - 6 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3
@entity0 took the opening set and had chances to win the third
@entity0 is the third @entity113 to go out on *tuesday* after @entity15 and @entity16
@entity17 is the only @entity8 player left in the *tournament*
