officials have confirmed that it will take around one year to repair the damage done to the launch pad caused by the @entity5 explosion			1
the rocket blew up six seconds after taking off on 28 october from the @entity7 on @entity8 in @entity9 but @entity10 , who manufacture and operate the rocket , say they could be ready to launch another as soon as 2016			1
officials have confirmed the @entity7 launchpad in @entity9 ( shown after the explosion ) could be repaired as soon as 2015			1
the @entity5 rocket exploded seconds after lift - off on 28 october , but in a statement it was revealed the pad escaped severe damage the @entity5 rocket took off as planned from @entity22 on 28 october at 6:22pm edt ( local time )			1
but just a few seconds into the flight the rocket failed , falling back to @entity26 in an enormous fiery explosion			0
amazingly , however , despite the huge fireball that erupted , the pad appears to have escaped severe damage - meaning normal operations can resume relatively swiftly			1
the @entity5 rocket was due to launch an unmanned @entity33 @entity32 spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the @entity36 on 28 october			1
this included science experiments , experiment hardware , spare parts , and crew provisions - as part of a £ 1.2 billion ( $ 1.9billion ) deal with @entity44			2
outfitted with a new , more powerful upper - stage engine , the @entity5 rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds ( 2,293 kg ) of supplies , science experiments and equipment , a 15 percent increase over previous missions			1
but just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed , leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure			2
@entity56 , deputy executive director of the @entity57 , which owns and operates launch pads at the @entity7 , confirmed the extent of the damage in a statement			2
‘ major elements of the @entity22 launch complex infrastructure , including the @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 ) and @entity67 , escaped severe damage during the catastrophic failure of @entity71 ’s @entity5 rocket shortly after liftoff , ’ he said			1
mr @entity56 added that officials from @entity44 , @entity10 and the @entity7 had begun removing contaminated soil from the launch site and were pumping out water , reported the @entity77			1
last week the @entity78 then revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage			0
repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £ 8.3 million and £ 12.8 million ( $ 13 million and $ 20 million )			0
and in a separate release , @entity10 confirmed they would launch a new @entity5 rocket by the end of 2016			1
@entity10 have said a new version of @entity5 could launch as soon as 2016			1
this will be using new engines , which will be tested in a ' hot fire ' next year			1
just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed , leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure ( shown ) the explosion partially contaminated the region around the launchpad			2
but last week the @entity78 revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage			0
repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £ 8.3 million and £ 12.8 million ( $ 13 million and $ 20 million ) @entity5 is contracted under @entity44 ’s @entity102 ( @entity102 ) programme to carry cargo to the @entity36 using the @entity32 spacecraft			1
@entity32 is launched on top of the @entity5 rocket and had three successful missions under its belt before this catastrophe			1
but while @entity5 is being rebuilt , @entity10 say they will launch @entity32 on other rockets to fulfill their contract demands with @entity44			1
what rockets these will be , however , has not yet been revealed			0
‘ under the new approach and in line with @entity10 ’s existing @entity102 contract , all remaining cargo will be delivered to the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) by the end of 2016 , ’ said the company			2
‘ there will be no cost increase to @entity44 and only minor adjustments will be needed to the cargo manifest in the near term			0
’ @entity10 also confirmed they will seek a new propulsion system upgrade for @entity5 , as it was believed the @entity128 engines used on the october launch were the reason for the failure			1
the company will perform a ‘ hot fire ’ test of the new engines next year to ensure they work as planned			2
cameras recovered from the launch pad in @entity9 shed new light on disaster ( still image shown )			2
the remotely operated cameras captured the explosion up - close in incredible detail			0
last month footage compiled by websites @entity146 and @entity147 revealed the explosion in unprecedented detail			0
remotely operated cameras recently recovered from the launch pad captured the explosion - and one even revealed footage from inside the resultant cloud of dust and debris			2
the sites explained that , as their cameras were so close to the launchpad , they had not been hopeful of retrieving much , if any , of the data			0
and they were also restricted from retrieving their data after lift - off owing to the obviously hazardous conditions			2
but incredibly , four cameras from journalists working for the two websites did survive , ' and the footage is nothing short of spectacular ' , said @entity171			0
' the initial lift - off looked flawless			2
then , suddenly , the exhaust turned bright yellow and became far brighter than usual , ' said @entity175 , a launch photojournalist for @entity146 and @entity177			0
' that 's when we knew things were about to get bad			0
the vehicle seemed to hang in the air and started to burn , it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion			0
' it fell in a pillar of fire and exploded on impact , and we could feel the heat on our face from 1.5 miles [ 2.4km ] away			0
seconds later the shockwave hit , and we all ran for the buses to evacuate			0
we had little hope of any cameras surviving			0
' the @entity44 - funded rocket exploded on its way to the @entity36 ( shown ) just six seconds after lift - off from the @entity7 on @entity8 in @entity9			1
the rocket exploded at 6:22pm edt on 28 october , and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine organisations said more than £ 125 million ( $ 200 million ) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion ( previous image shown )			1
@entity10 said it would stop using the type of @entity128 engines that were employed when its unmanned @entity5 commercial supply rocket exploded they explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras , but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the @entity216			1
one of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion			0
as dust and debris flies around , the camera somehow manages to survive			0
the rocket was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine and also a number of @entity26 - observation satellites			0
organisations said more than £ 125 million ( $ 200 million ) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion .			0
