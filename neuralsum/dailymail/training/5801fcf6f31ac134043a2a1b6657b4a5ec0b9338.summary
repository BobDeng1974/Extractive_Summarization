fresh - faced and dressed in a simple white shirt , the woman peering out of @entity2 's portrait of @entity3 released over the weekend appeared to be in her mid- 30s at most			1
but the while the @entity3 might have the complexion of a much - younger woman , she is celebrating her 50th birthday today			1
so how has she managed to stay so fresh faced ? ' her secret is a good skincare routine and a healthy living , ' says skin expert @entity11 of @entity15 skincare brand @entity13			1
' and as she celebrates her half - century with a visit to a @entity24 hospital , the @entity3 has plenty to smile about			1
the mother of two young children , 11 - year - old @entity28 and seven - year - old @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity3 juggles family life with an increasingly busy schedule of royal engagements - including two today			1
like much of the work she does , the focus will be on the disadvantaged and disabled with the visit including a trip to see the work of the @entity40 which is funded by the queen elizabeth ii @entity41			2
and in a further sign of @entity3 's popularity within the royal family - in particular with the @entity42 - the @entity3 is set to be confirmed as vice-patron of the @entity41 , second only to the monarch			1
but while her extensive charity work might fly relatively under the radar , her increasing sartorial confidence has n't gone unnoticed - and neither has her fresh - faced complexion			2
confident : the 50 - year - old @entity3 ( left ) is more confident now than she was in her late 30s ( right ) good bone structure : @entity3 looks little different now to the way she did at 35 ( pictured here in 2000 ) stylish : as these photographs of @entity3 prior to her marriage reveal , her style has changed considerably softer : she keeps her make - up natural and gives her complexion a boost with regular exercise what 's more , none of it , says top cosmetic surgeon dr @entity66 , is the result of surgical nips and tucks			1
' @entity3 is proof that lots of sleep and eating well keep you looking young , ' says dr @entity66			1
' stop calorie counting and start enjoying the right foods			2
' @entity3 also has great bone structure which always helps			1
' @entity77 , a nutritional expert and founder of @entity79 , agrees			2
' @entity3 looks fabulous at 50 thanks to her beautiful glowing skin			1
' a diet of plant - based foods and lean protein has a huge impact on the appearance of skin , as does keeping well hydrated and getting proper sleep			2
' exercise is also crucial for keeping the years at bay , although as @entity91 , founder of cosmeceutical brand @entity92 , points out , this needs to be supplemented with good skincare			1
' @entity3 leads a very healthy lifestyle - she rides horses and runs regularly both of which help keep her body and skin in great condition , ' explains @entity91			1
' she also lives out in the country which means there is less exposure to the damage caused by pollution and free radicals			2
' but that 's not all			2
' the tone and texture of her skin is beautiful which suggests she uses some sort of brightening serum , ' continues @entity91			2
' although she has some fine lines , her complexion is peaches and cream and that is what is most important for mature skin			2
a lack of tone and texture is far more ageing than lines and wrinkles			2
' that @entity3 manages to pull all this off , despite having an increasingly busy schedule is no mean feat , although her embrace of cleverly applied make - up undoubtedly helps			1
careful choices : her choice of make - up echoes the increasingly sophisticated shades in her wardrobe getting it right : the @entity3 goes natural by day but ups the ante - just about - at night low key : @entity3 , seen here meeting actress @entity141 , opts for delicate peachy shades on cheeks ' @entity3 has a great way of keeping her make up very balanced and clean , ' explains @entity145 make - up artist @entity146			1
' she lives by the less is more rule , which , when you are a public figure representing the royal family , is important			0
' but , adds @entity146 , low key does n't mean boring			0
' @entity3 keeps it classic but adds an up - to - date edge by subtly following tone and shade trends in her lip and blush and also the finish on her skin			1
' this could mean making her look slightly more dewy or matte , using different shades of peach or pink nudes on lips and livening the whole thing up by adding a pop of soft pink or peach on the cheeks			0
' eyes are kept to a minimum but with definition			0
you will notice @entity3 generally keeps most of the eye make - up to the top lid - this is a great way of keeping a look more natural			1
' her embrace of nude make - up echoes the soft palette that dominates her wardrobe			0
gone are the pillarbox reds and lilacs that dominated her early years in the royal family and in their place are subtle cream , delicate shell pink and dramatic black			0
flattering : @entity3 's glowing complexion is helped along by flattering colour choices warm : @entity3 gives 10 - year - old @entity192 a hug during a visit to @entity195 in @entity196 chic : @entity3 offset the dramatic black ensemble worn to last june 's @entity199 with natural make - up looking good : as @entity3 enters her sixth decade , she looks lovelier than ever nowhere was this more obvious than during her appearance at church alongside the rest of the royal family at @entity207 last @entity208			1
resplendent in a powder pink coat , a smiling @entity3 looked fresh - face and glowing , with the rosy colour of the coat emphasising naturally rosy cheeks			1
she pulled off the same trick during a pre-christmas visit to the races at @entity199 in @entity216 , echoing the deep charcoal shade of her tweed suit in her soft , grey eyeliner			2
at @entity199 last june , the glamorous @entity3 ensured all eyes were on her - despite facing stiff competition from the @entity42 and other members of the royal family - when she showed up in a dramatic all - black ensemble teamed with fresh pink cheeks and minimal eye make - up			1
this less - is - more approach is key to looking good in your 50s , says make - up artist @entity232 , who explains that the key to taking 10 years off is to keep your look fresh but polished			0
' @entity3 is a fan of minimal make - up but she is n't afraid to use make - up to define her features , ' he explains			1
' the result is youthful , classic and timeless			0
' fresh - faced : @entity3 might be 50 but she looks as glamorous as ever while @entity3 benefits from having beautiful skin and a great bone structure , those not so blessed can recreate the look using make - up			1
celebrity make - up artist @entity232 explains how getting @entity3 's fresh - faced glow is done ( and all within 10 minutes ) : skin ' prep skin for make - up with a really good primer			1
i love @entity252 's @entity251 ( £ 70 , charlottetilbury.com ) , which hydrates and adds radiance while making cosmetics stay on longer			0
next choose a light reflecting concealer such as @entity257 to @entity258 ( £ 18 , joancollinsbeauty.com ) in a shade that is one lighter than your real skin tone			0
apply all around the eye area and pat gently into place , this should lift your entire face and give the illusion of eight hours sleep			0
foundation is also key to getting a youthful look but make sure it 's something light - reflective and moisturising such as @entity270 ( £ 30.50 , yslbeauty.co.uk )			0
blend the foundation around the concealer - do n't be tempted to go over it - and make sure it 's an exact match with your skintone			0
cheeks a cream blush such as @entity282 's @entity281 ( £ 19 , bobbibrown.co.uk ) will give you an instant glow while the creamy formula wo n't collect in any wrinkles			0
apply it to the apples of your cheeks using your fingers and blend it back towards the hairline			0
lips colour your lips using the same cream blush you used on your cheeks and finish with a lipliner - a beauty essential for older women			0
lips shrink as you age , so a defined lip line can help lift and define the face			0
i like the @entity301 ( £ 17 , esteelauder.co.uk )			0
eyes as @entity3 's defined brows demonstrate , groomed eyebrows totally change your face and pull up the eye area and the whole face with it			1
choose a shade a little darker than your hair then start filling in using tiny strokes from the inside edges out			0
extend the line past the end of your lashes to frame your face and knock off the years			0
new cid cosmetics i - groom is great for natural - looking brows ( £ 17 , newcidcosmetics.com )			0
use a neutral base such as the ones found in @entity320 's @entity319 in @entity321 ( £ 40 , burberry.com ) on the eyelids themselves , colouring from lash to brow , and then add a mid tone from base to crease			0
sweep the same shade underneath the lower lashes to really this same shade and sweep underneath lower lashes to open up the eyes			0
finally , finish off the look with a sweep of black eyeliner across the top lashes and two coats of mascara to make eyes pop. i swear by @entity340 in @entity341 ( £ 18 , bobbibrown.co.uk ) and @entity342 in black ( £ 19.95 , code - beautiful.com )			0
although lots of people think brown is softer , i always avoid it because it tends to make eyes look tired and sore			2
