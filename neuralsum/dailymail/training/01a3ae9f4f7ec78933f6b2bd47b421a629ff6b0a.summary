huge differences in the face - to - face teaching time students receive at @entity3 's top universities have been exposed by new official figures			1
some undergraduates – paying tuition fees of £ 9,000 a year – get fewer than half the hours of lectures , seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at another university			2
critics say the disparities mean many are getting a ' very raw deal ' and accuse some universities of failing to offer value for money			1
some undergraduates get fewer than half the hours of lectures , seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at another university the new figures , compiled from statistics on government website @entity27 , show that one of the widest gaps involves undergraduates studying history at @entity33 , who spend just eight per cent of their course in lectures and seminars , with the rest in ' independent ' study			1
this is fewer than 100 hours a year ' contact ' time with academics and works out at a cost of nearly £ 100 an hour			0
but if they are reading the same subject at @entity45 , they will receive more than triple the face - to - face teaching hours , at a rate of about £ 28 an hour			1
in other examples , politics students at @entity50 and theology students at @entity52 spend ten per cent of their time in face - to - face teaching – about 120 hours of lectures and tutorials a year – while their counterparts at @entity58 and @entity59 enjoy double that			1
at some newer universities , where the ability of the intake is more mixed and teaching takes priority over research , contact time tends to be greater			0
professor @entity69 , director of the @entity70 at @entity71 , said : ' some students are getting a very raw deal			1
the temptation of these universities is to free - up staff to concentrate on their own research , which tends to be more lucrative than teaching			0
' @entity80 , the master of leading independent school @entity81 , @entity82 , said : ' the majority of students have a tremendous time at university and are appreciative of that			2
' but increasingly we hear of disappointment in the low level of demand placed on them and the lack of quality time with academics and personal attention			0
' one history student in his second year at @entity98 said : ' we all left school at the same level but friends at @entity102 and other universities are working much more intensively than us – but we pay the same fees			2
' the lack of face - to - face teaching on some courses has been one of the biggest causes of complaints by students			2
' however , official figures have become available only in recent months on the website after ministers insisted families had the right to make comparisons before choosing a course			0
@entity33 's history department said it offered one - to - one drop - in sessions and dissertation supervision with academics that was not reflected in the statistics			0
@entity50 said its courses ' deliberately involve independent study alongside teaching from some of the most respected academics in the world ' to allow students to ' think critically ' .			0

history students at @entity98 spend 8 *%* of their course in lectures and seminars
but at @entity45 they *'ll* receive more than triple the time
critics say many fee - paying students are getting a ' very raw deal '
