@entity0 has won hundreds of awards , but she 'll likely never forget her 2009 best female video at the @entity3			2
rapper @entity5 rushed the stage , stealing the microphone from the unsuspecting singer and insisting fellow nominee @entity4 had ' one of the best videos of all time			1
' however , six years later the two seemed chummy as they posed backstage at the 57th @entity12 in @entity13			2
the pair were also spotted posing together , standing close as both sported large smiles for the cameras			2
this comes as a surprise after the shocking interruption that threw off the @entity38 singer 's 2009 @entity3 acceptance speech			1
@entity39 : @entity0 and @entity5 sported wide grins as they shook hands at the 57th @entity12 on sunday @entity41 the hatchet ? it seems @entity0 may have made a new famous friend after sunday 's @entity12 ceremony @entity46 teal gown click to check out the current line at @entity49 ! visit site @entity0 was clearly having a fantastic time at the @entity12 last night as she danced up a storm			1
shake it off and all that ! and we give her credit for busting some moves because her dress was n't exactly the most conducive to getting down ! the pop starlet chose a dramatic gown by @entity46 for the awards show and while we love the combined mini and maxi cut , it was n't the most practical of looks			2
the teal fabric is just beautiful and has an iridescence that really makes an impact			0
plus those pink @entity69 heels are a genius touch of styling			0
@entity73 and turquoise can sometimes be tricky to pull off but it just requires taking the time to find out the right shade for you			0
so why not give it a go at your next black tie event ? it will certainly make a change from all the black and you 'll be sure to turn heads			0
so start your search with our edit below			0
we love @entity91 's slinky dress at @entity92 or splash some serious cash on @entity94 at @entity95			2
stylestalker teal dress at @entity92 ( now reduced to $ 85.95 ) visit site @entity94 teal gown at @entity95 visit site @entity101 teal dress at @entity102 visit site after it was announced that @entity0 had one @entity105 , @entity5 rushed the stage to denounce her victory over close friend @entity4			1
@entity0 began her acceptance speech for the coveted award , saying : ' thank you so much ! i always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these some day , but i never actually thought it would have happened			0
i sing country music so thank you so much for giving me a chance to win a @entity3 award			0
' however , she was quickly interrupted by @entity5 , who said : ' @entity0 , i 'm really happy for you , i'mma let you finish , but @entity4 has one of the best videos of all time			1
one of the best videos of all time			0
' surprise appearance : @entity127 ran onto stage to protest @entity0 's win , insisting that @entity4 's video was ' one of the best videos of all time ' shocked : the 1989 hitmaker was speechless after the rapper stole her microphone at the 2009 @entity3 ceremony he was referencing @entity137 ) which was also nominated in the category			1
however , the mortified look on @entity4 's face seemed to hint she did n't share his opinion of @entity0 's win			1
she later invited @entity0 onstage to give a proper acceptance speech when she won the award for @entity145			2
however , it appears the bad blood between the two artists is in the past , as they posed playfully at the 2015 @entity12 ceremony			0
working things out : perhaps @entity0 wanted to amend her issues with @entity5 upon growing discussion of her feud with @entity154 meeting the family : the songstress also took time to chat with @entity5 's wife , reality star @entity157 playing mediator ? ( l to @entity159 ) @entity0 's new pal @entity160 could also have played a hand in she and @entity5 - pictured here with with @entity157 - resolving their issues but even though he made his peace with @entity0 , the rapper still showed a bit of a naughty streak as he recreated his 2009 @entity3 moment by running the stage following @entity171 's win for @entity172 for @entity173			1
the artist beat out @entity4 's self - titled album , and for a moment it looked as if @entity127 was going steal another microphone , but he quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat			1
at the awards show @entity0 was nominated for @entity182 and @entity183 - which both went to @entity185 - and @entity186 - which went to @entity187			0
she did take the stage to introduce pal @entity185 's performance , as well as to present his victory in the category of @entity192			1
@entity5 was nominated for @entity193 - which he lost to @entity194 and @entity195 - and @entity196 - which he lost to @entity197			0
he also performed at the event , returning to the @entity12 stage for the first time in six years for both his single only one , and his collaboration with @entity203 and @entity195 , @entity204			0
deja vu ? @entity5 almost repeated his 2009 moment , as he rushed the stage following @entity171 's win for @entity172 , but quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat thrilled : @entity0 was elated to present the award for @entity192 to her pal @entity185 back in the game : @entity5 ( right ) returned to the @entity12 stage for the first time in six years , performing @entity204 alongside @entity203 ( left ) and @entity195 ( center ) @entity172 @entity171 , morning phase - winner @entity4 , @entity4 @entity215 , x @entity185 , in the @entity217 @entity187 , girl best new artist @entity185 - @entity220 @entity221 @entity222 @entity223 @entity224 @entity182 @entity225 ) , @entity185 - winner fancy , @entity222 ft. @entity227 @entity228 , @entity229 shake it off , @entity0 all about that @entity231 , @entity232 @entity183 @entity225 ) , @entity185 - winner @entity228 , @entity229 all about that @entity231 , @entity232 shake it off , @entity0 take me to @entity235 , " @entity236 @entity237 the @entity238 , @entity194 - winner @entity239 , @entity222 because the @entity241 , @entity240 nobody 's smiling , @entity244 @entity245 , @entity246 @entity247 , @entity247 @entity248 say something , a @entity250 ft. @entity249 - winner fancy , @entity222 ft. @entity227 a @entity253 , @entity254 @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 & @entity258 @entity259 , @entity154 ft. @entity260 @entity261 i , @entity197 - winner 3005 , @entity240 0 to @entity262 , @entity263 @entity264 , @entity194 @entity265 , @entity266 @entity267 @entity268 , @entity269 this is all yours , @entity272 @entity273 , @entity274 @entity275 , @entity276 @entity277 , @entity278 @entity279 @entity173 , @entity171 - winner @entity280 , @entity280 @entity281 , @entity282 @entity283 , @entity284 @entity285 , @entity286 @entity287 @entity288 , @entity289 - winner @entity290 , @entity171 fever , @entity282 gim me @entity292 , @entity280 @entity277 , @entity278 @entity294 @entity295 , @entity296 - winner @entity297 , @entity298 @entity299 , @entity300 the way i 'm livin ' , @entity303 12 stories , @entity223 @entity193 the monster , @entity194 ft. @entity195 - winner @entity306 , common ft. @entity307 tuesday , i love @entity309 ft. @entity263 studio , @entity246 ft. @entity311 bound 2 , @entity5 & @entity312 @entity196 i , @entity197 - winner @entity313 , @entity258 bound 2 , @entity5 & @entity312 @entity314 , @entity247 0 to @entity262 , @entity263 @entity315 i 'm not gon na @entity317 , @entity318 - winner @entity319 , @entity320 automatic , @entity296 @entity321 , @entity300 meanwhile back at @entity322 's , @entity324 ft. @entity323 @entity325 @entity327 , @entity326 - winner @entity328 , @entity296 with @entity329 @entity330 , @entity331 meanwhile back at @entity322 's , @entity324 ft. @entity323 raise ' @entity332 , @entity333 ft. @entity300 @entity334 something in the water , @entity329 - winner @entity336 , @entity300 invisible , @entity337 automatic , @entity296 @entity338 , @entity333 @entity339 in the @entity217 , @entity185 - winner ghost stories , @entity254 @entity341 , @entity342 my everything , @entity256 @entity345 , @entity154 x , @entity215 @entity346 @entity347 , @entity187 - winner @entity348 , @entity307 @entity4 , @entity4 @entity349 , @entity350 @entity351 , @entity352 @entity353 @entity354 , @entity220 while ( 1 , @entity355 @entity356 , @entity357 do it again , @entity358 & @entity360 @entity361 , @entity362 @entity186 happy , @entity187 - winner all of me , @entity364 @entity228 , @entity229 @entity225 , @entity185 shake it off , @entity0 @entity366 @entity367 , @entity368 @entity369 , back on the @entity370 @entity371 , @entity372 @entity373 , out of many , one music @entity375 , @entity376 @entity377 , amid the noise and the @entity379 @entity380 @entity381 , @entity382 & @entity383 - winner sending you a @entity385 , @entity386 @entity387 , @entity388 partners , @entity390 @entity391 , @entity392 best @entity393 @entity394 , @entity395 - winner terms of @entity397 , @entity398 @entity399 , @entity400 ' a dotted line , @entity402 @entity403 sounds in @entity404 , @entity405 @entity406 diary of a @entity408 , @entity409 - winner actors @entity410 , @entity412 a @entity413 , @entity414 @entity415 : @entity417 @entity416 , @entity417 @entity418 , @entity419 we will survive : @entity421 and the @entity422 , @entity423 @entity424 help , @entity425 - winner @entity426 , @entity427 withholding nothing : @entity429 , @entity430 forever yours , @entity432 @entity433 , @entity434 @entity435 @entity277 , @entity278 - @entity220 gim me @entity292 , @entity280 do @entity437 ?
