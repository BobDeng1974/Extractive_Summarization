by @entity0 a comet hurtling towards @entity2 is set to put three @entity4 spacecraft at risk			1
@entity4 is taking steps to protect its @entity2 orbiters , while preserving opportunities to gather valuable scientific data , as @entity11 / 2013 @entity10 heads toward a close flyby on 19 october			1
while the comet itself poses little danger , debris that is travelling in its wake could pose a problem if any spacecraft pass through its tail			2
@entity4 is taking steps to protect three spacecraft that will be in orbit around @entity2 when @entity24 makes a pass by the planet on 19 october ( illustration shown )			1
the comet will miss @entity2 by about 82,000 miles ( 132,000 kilometers ) , and its trail of dust particles could pose a threat to the three probes the comet 's nucleus will miss @entity2 by about 82,000 miles ( 132,000 kilometers ) , shedding material hurtling at about 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) per second relative to @entity2 and @entity2 - orbiting spacecraft			1
despite posing a threat , this event also poses a rare opportunity to study an interesting comet			0
in the days before and after the comet 's flyby , @entity4 will study the comet by taking advantage of how close it comes to @entity2			1
researchers plan to use several instruments on the @entity2 orbiters to study the nucleus , the coma surrounding the nucleus , and the tail of @entity10 , as well as the possible effects on the @entity2 atmosphere			1
this particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system , so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system 's earliest days			0
maven will study gases coming off the comet 's nucleus into its coma as it is warmed by the sun , and it will also look for effects the comet flyby may have on the planet 's upper atmosphere and observe the comet as it travels through the solar wind			0
@entity72 will study thermal and spectral properties of the comet 's coma and tail			0
the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) will monitor @entity2 ' atmosphere for possible temperature increases and cloud formation , as well as changes in electron density at high altitudes			0
the @entity77 team also plans to study gases in the comet 's coma			0
along with other @entity77 observations , the team anticipates this event will yield detailed views of the comet 's nucleus and potentially reveal its rotation rate and surface features			0
at that velocity , even the smallest particle - estimated to be about 0.02 inches ( 0.5 millimetres ) across - could cause significant damage to a spacecraft			2
@entity4 currently operates two @entity2 orbiters , with a third on its way and expected to arrive in @entity2 orbit just a month before the comet flyby			2
teams operating the orbiters plan to have all spacecraft positioned on the opposite side of the @entity2 when the comet is most likely to pass by			2
' three expert teams have modeled this comet for @entity4 and provided forecasts for its flyby of @entity2 , ' explained dr @entity110 , chief scientist for the @entity111 at @entity4 's @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			1
' the hazard is not an impact of the comet nucleus , but the trail of debris coming from it			0
' using constraints provided by @entity124 - based observations , the modeling results indicate that the hazard is not as great as first anticipated			0
' @entity2 will be right at the edge of the debris cloud , so it might encounter some of the particles - or it might not			0
' during the day 's events , the smallest distance between @entity10 's nucleus and @entity2 will be less than one - tenth the distance of any known previous @entity132 comet flyby			2
the period of greatest risk to orbiting spacecraft will start about 90 minutes later and last about 20 minutes , when @entity2 will come closest to the center of the widening dust trail from the nucleus			2
@entity4 's @entity77 ( @entity77 ) made one orbit - adjustment manoeuvre on 2 july as part of the process of re-positioning the spacecraft for the 19 october event			1
an additional manoeuvre is planned for 27 august			0
the team operating @entity4 's @entity72 orbiter , meanwhile , is planning a similar manoeuvre on 5 august to get their spacecraft out of harm 's way			1
@entity4 's @entity151 ( @entity151 ) spacecraft , meanwhile , is on its way to the @entity2 and will enter orbit on 21 september			1
@entity4 's @entity154 ( illustration shown ) is due to join the @entity77 and @entity72 in orbit around the @entity2 on 21 september			1
the team running the probe are already preparing a manoeuvre to ensure the spacecraft is not damaged by the incoming @entity24 the maven team is planning to conduct a precautionary manoeuvre on 9 october , prior to the start of the mission 's main science phase in early november			0
of course there wo n't just be operational spacecraft in orbit around @entity2 when the comet approaches ; two active rovers are also on the surface			1
however @entity2 ' atmosphere , though much thinner than @entity124 's , is thick enough that @entity4 does not anticipate any hazard to the @entity175 and @entity176 rovers on the planet 's surface , even if dust particles from the comet hit the atmosphere and form into meteors			1
rover cameras may be used to observe the comet before the flyby , and to monitor the atmosphere for meteors while the comet 's dust trail is closest to the planet			0
observations from @entity124 - based and space telescopes provided data used for modeling to make predictions about @entity10 's @entity2 flyby , which were in turn used for planning protective manoeuvres .			0

@entity4 scientists in @entity114 are taking action to save probes from a comet
three spacecraft will be orbiting @entity2 when the comet passes on 19 october
known as @entity11 / 2013 @entity209 the main danger is from its tail
this contains many pieces of debris that could damage @entity4 's spacecraft
so the agency is taking steps to position the probes so that they will avoid it
the debris is moving at 35 miles per second and would cause significant damage if it hit one of the spacecraft
but the @entity2 rovers @entity176 and @entity175 on the surface should be safe thanks to the @entity2 atmosphere
