by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 24 february 2013 this is the ' mummy 's boy ' deemed too fat to be a suicide bomber who wanted to kill thousands of people in a @entity6 terror attack worse than 7/7			1
' @entity8 ' @entity7 , 31 , is facing life imprisonment after being convicted of planning the biggest terrorist atrocity the @entity6 has faced in generations			1
the 23 - stone chemist , who plotted to plant eight rucksack nail bombs in crowded places around the country and was the ringleader of a gang who wanted to turn @entity6 into ' a war zone '			1
nicknamed ' @entity32 ' at school , one ex-classmate , told @entity34 : ' he used to write his own rap music and perform it to us			1
it had us in stitches			2
he was the class idiot			2
' another former friend told the @entity34 : ' in about 2008 or 2009 he cut all ties with his old school friends			2
@entity7 , nicknamed ' @entity32 ' began plotting bombing attacks across the @entity6 ' never in a million years did we think he could be responsible for such an evil plan			1
' he was one of the ' four lions ' gang and it was bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb - making skills while at training camps in @entity52			2
he was too overweight to go on physical training exercises , and admitted he was mixing chemicals rather than ' running up and down the mountains with weapons '			2
@entity7 gained an a at a level chemistry , and honed his skills during a four year pharmaceuticals course at @entity61 in @entity62 , coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003			1
he barely worked afterwards and spent his time showing his fellow terrorists how to make a bomb out of sports injury treatments			2
his fascination for science first began during experiments at school while studying for @entity73 chemistry classes , when the teacher showed him how to distil chemicals with a @entity77 burner			0
' when i was doing my gcses , one of the teachers did an experiment where he had a @entity77 burner and he threw a chemical on to the fire ' , he told the court			0
' it caused a massive flame which blackened the roof , and that kind of got me into it			0
' after a raid on the group 's headquarters in @entity62 , @entity7 had chemistry textbooks left over from his university days on his book shelves in his bedroom , mixed in with a @entity99 flag and terrorist handbooks			1
@entity101 and @entity102 were found guilty of planning a string of bombings that prosecutors said could have been deadlier than the july 7 attacks in @entity107 he had also searched repeatedly online for bomb making tips and details of how to concoct homemade explosives			1
among his @entity113 search history was a website containing the @entity115			0
@entity116 admitted in court he had spent eight - and - a - half years memorising the @entity118 , from the age of 19			0
he wanted to treat himself to a quad bike in the run up to his martyrdom and was overheard telling his fellow plotters : ' it 's good fun , yeah , but i would n't do it on the road - that 's not befitting , bro			1
@entity102 and @entity7 ( right ) were ' central figures ' in a terrorist bomb plot they planned to inflict across the @entity6 the trio funded the plot by pretending to be @entity133 charity street collectors it was @entity7 's bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb - making skills while at training camps in @entity52 charity funded terror : the men posed as fundraisers for a @entity133 charity ( left ) then used the cash to pay for bomb devices such as this alarm clock ( right ) ' a guy with a beard and that sitting on top of that does n't look good			1
' @entity7 , 31 , @entity102 , 27 , and @entity101 , 27 , all from @entity62 , were convicted on thursday of plotting the ' spectacular campaign ' designed to claim as many lives as the 2005 @entity153 bombs that killed 52 innocent people the trio , who met at school and called themselves the @entity158 after the black comedy film by @entity160 , even funded the plot by pretending to be @entity133 charity street collectors			1
police received no intelligence from the @entity133 community in @entity62 about the terror cell , even after relatives of four of the gang discovered they had travelled to @entity52			0
the only time police were contacted about any of them was over an allegation of aggressive fundraising , concerning their charity street collections			0
the lack of information raises questions over @entity177 , the @entity179 ’s strategy to combat violent extremism , which has police community engagement at its core			0
detective inspector @entity184 , senior investigating officer in the @entity185 , said the extended families of @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 ‘ became aware ’ the men had gone to a terror training camp when @entity188 called home			1
although the families immediately pressured them into returning , none contacted police			0
police and security services were aware the four were travelling , and they had been recorded talking about getting their families into paradise through their martyrdom			0
but officers decided against stopping them at that time to preserve the surveillance operation			0
according to detectives , none of the men received any terror training as they left the camps after a day			0
assistant chief constable @entity211 said that while the ‘ ideal ’ scenario would have been for the relatives to inform police of what had happened , the families had ‘ tried to do their best to bring them back and stop them from getting into harm ’ .			0

@entity7 's own mother called him a ' mummy 's boy '
he and @entity102 , 27 , and @entity101 , 27 , wanted ' to rival 9/11 '
