@entity2 mps ratified the @entity87 in a parliamentary vote
the vote follows the death of @entity17 in southern @entity2 last week
the debate came on the same day as *hundreds* gathered for her funeral
25 countries have signed the @entity14 convention
but it has only been ratified by parliaments in five of those countries
it needs to be passed in ten countries to take effect
