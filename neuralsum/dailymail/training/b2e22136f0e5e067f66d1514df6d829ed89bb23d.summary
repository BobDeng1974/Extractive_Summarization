@entity0 : @entity1 and @entity2 were the public faces of an @entity5 campaign to make people aware that tweeting can attract burglars this is the real - life couple whose oversharing social media habits made them the stars of a commercial where their home appeared to be robbed and all their possession sold off			1
@entity1 and @entity2 , both 25 , were seized upon by @entity5 insurers , who noticed their tendency to post so much sensitive information online they were prime candidates for burglary			2
and , using national television and the big screens of the @entity26 as their platform , the company staged an elaborate fake robbery of their home in @entity30 to teach them - and others - a lesson			0
at the start of the game , @entity5 's robber mascot mayhem , played by @entity34 , appeared on the big screens to ' thank ' the @entity39 for revealing they were at the game in @entity42 - and therefore not home to guard their things			1
he told viewers : ' i 'm kind of a social media nerd - i 'm also kind of a burglar			0
so when the people who live here posted live from tonight 's game i did what any self - respecting nerd - burglary would do			0
' i let myself in and started selling their stuff live on the internet ... ' @entity5 then directed viewers to an online marketplace containing an exact inventory of all their possessions , sold at ludicrously low prices , culminating in their car , which went for $ 200			1
going ... gone : the couple revealed that their possessions were painstakingly recreated , then sold for real via a promotional website while the ad campaign was running in an interview with @entity70 , the real - life couple revealed that they were tracked down by market researchers months in advance , who then recreated their home for the commercial			2
part of what sealed the deal was a series of posts from the couple 's @entity83 honeymoon , which went up in real - time and was proof of a substantial voyage			0
for the stunt , @entity5 made real - life replicas of 300 of the couple 's possessions , which were genuinely sold and shipped to the first bidder , @entity2 said : ' it was disconcerting to know our car could be sold for $ 200 or that this could really happen as a result of oversharing on social media			1
' they said they have reviewed their privacy settings - which were previously stuck on ' public ' - as a result of the campaign - but admitted it 's unlikely they will stop sharing as much , or as often .			0
