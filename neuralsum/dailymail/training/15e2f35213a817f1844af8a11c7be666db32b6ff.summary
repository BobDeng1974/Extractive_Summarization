@entity0 is being sued for up to half a million pounds by a @entity2 holidaymaker who claims she contracted a life - threatening illness on an all - inclusive package holiday			2
@entity5 , a 31 - year - old mother of one , said her dream @entity7 holiday ended with a case of food poisoning so severe that she had to have her gall bladder surgically removed			1
she said she became violently ill a day after eating a piece of mystery fish in a hotel restaurant infested with stray cats and birds at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
mrs @entity5 became ill while staying at the @entity17 in @entity18 in september 2011 according to a writ filed at @entity21 's @entity20 , mrs @entity5 ate ‘ a small piece of an unknown fish in breadcrumbs , served lukewarm ’ after ordering the ‘ catch of the day ’ at the resort ’s beach bar and grill in september 2011			1
in the writ , her barrister , @entity29 , said she did not consider the fish to taste ‘ fresh ’ , and she was awoken by ‘ shooting , stabbing pains ’ the following morning and had to be transported to hospital by ambulance			2
her condition was so severe that she was airlifted to a hospital in @entity36 , where she underwent emergency surgery			1
mrs @entity5 , from @entity38 , remained in hospital in @entity36 for almost a month before she was airlifted to the @entity2 , where she underwent further surgery			1

the holidaymaker ate ‘ a small piece of an unknown fish in breadcrumbs , served lukewarm ’ the barrister claims that @entity0 , through their ‘ agents ’ at the hotel , ‘ failed to ensure that food and drink served to @entity56 was safe for human consumption ’			1
the barrister said the resort had also ‘ permitted stray cats and birds to enter the beach bar and grill restaurant with the consequent risk of contamination			1
’ mr @entity29 alleges that there were no adequate food hygiene systems at the hotel and that the ‘ hotel accommodation was so unsafe that no reasonable holidaymaker would agree to go on holiday there			0

‘ @entity0 exercised all reasonable care and skill in the selection of the @entity17 and the monitoring of the services and facilities , including the provision of food and beverages			0
