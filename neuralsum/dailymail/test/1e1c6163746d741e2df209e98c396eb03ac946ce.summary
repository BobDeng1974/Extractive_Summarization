@entity2 galactico @entity0 will be the subject of a three - way £ 75million transfer battle between @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 this summer			1
@entity0 has indicated , publicly at least , that he wants to stay at @entity8			2
but sources in @entity10 suggest that the club could be willing to offload him even though manager @entity13 has said he wants the winger to remain at the club			1
@entity8 forward @entity0 is a transfer target for @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity7 @entity0 could be sold by @entity8 as they pursue a deal for @entity19 star @entity18 the complex politics at @entity2 mean that @entity0 could be traded to help finance the inevitable signing of at least one platinum player during the summer and work within the parameters of @entity24			1
@entity19 's @entity18 is one star being lined up , and @entity2 may feel they need to find space for @entity28 in their first team , the player having recently expressed his frustration at being sidelined for much of the season			2
@entity18 only recently signed a new four - year deal with @entity19			1
but it is understood that was more to optimise his transfer value			0
under the terms of his previous contract @entity18 had a buy - out clause of £ 20m			1
that has been written out of the new deal and the @entity42 club believe he is worth double that in the current market			0
when @entity0 signed his record £ 86m deal to join @entity8 from @entity47 two years ago he had a £ 75m release clause written in			1
dortmund rate @entity18 ( right ) at around £ 40million after his £ 20m buy - out clause was taken out of his new deal @entity0 has said he wants to stay at @entity8 despite becoming unpopular with some fans this season as it stands @entity5 would seem favourites to buy @entity0 , and the @entity54 also want @entity8 centre half @entity55			1
but @entity7 and @entity6 will be in the mix too as they both seek to bolster their attacking power			0
ultimately it will come down to which club tables the best deal should real open the door			0
the fact @entity0 has become unpopular with a section of the @entity65 despite having a decent season could prove a deciding factor			2
a few weeks ago it seemed @entity69 seemed destined to return to the @entity70 this summer at the end of his year - long loan at @entity8 came to an end			2
@entity74 , @entity47 and @entity75 were all in the hunt for the @entity6 striker who can be bought from @entity6 for £ 7m			1
but suddenly @entity2 could decide to buy @entity69 themselves			0
@entity5 appear most likely to sign @entity0 - and they also want his @entity8 team - mate @entity55 ( right ) @entity8 could look to make @entity69 's loan move a permanent one after his goal against @entity81 it might have been a simple finish served up by @entity83 , but the late winner @entity69 scored to beat city rivals @entity81 in their @entity86 quarter - final has lifted the striker to legendary status			1
the @entity65 fans saluted @entity69 with astonishing continual chanting of the player 's nickname ' @entity69 ' until he eventually left the pitch			2
not even @entity83 has enjoyed such adulation			0
the @entity8 hierarchy may find it unacceptable to let @entity69 go now			2
and if the player becomes more regular there is the added commercial factor of his shirt sales in his native @entity101			0
if @entity69 is retained that would be another reason why the club would be ready to move on @entity0			0
@entity105 could get a dream move to @entity8 if @entity107 rejects the @entity10 giants and signs a new £ 200,000 - a - week deal with @entity6			1
@entity105 is set to leave @entity5 in a £ 10m move this summer			1
@entity110 want him but a move to @entity2 could be on if the @entity113 side do n't move for @entity47 's @entity114 , who would cost £ 25m			1
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity105 could join @entity8 this summer if @entity107 stays at @entity6 @entity115 will come under pressure to sell striker @entity117 this summer if bids pass £ 30m			1
@entity110 may make a move even if they sign @entity120 , with the future of @entity122 suddenly uncertain			2
@entity124 's place in the squad will also have to be filled but it 's unclear which club will be willing to sign @entity124 given his six - figure weekly wages			0
the @entity129 seem certain to take @entity117 's @entity131 international team mate @entity130 back from his year - long loan with @entity133			0
@entity134 could be part of the deal with @entity115 , and will be on the wanted list of several other @entity70 clubs			1
@entity115 striker @entity117 could be sold by the club if they receive a bid of over £ 30m this summer @entity142 are set to give @entity143 a new one - year deal next season , and if the club get promoted it would mark a remarkable return to the @entity70 for the former @entity149 centre half			1
@entity143 's top - flight career seemed over two years ago when he left @entity151 after the problems he has had with injury			0
but at the age of 35 @entity143 has been a constant force in @entity142 's promotion drive this season			0
veteran defender @entity143 ( left ) is set to earn a new one - year contract at @entity142 @entity160 striker @entity159 will be a target for @entity74 and @entity162 this summer			1
@entity163 may move for @entity164 , who will be released by @entity47 at the end of the season			1
@entity168 president @entity167 admitted to an @entity170 newspaper that the club want @entity7 's @entity172			0
' we like him and we are sure @entity174 will know how to make the most of his talents , ' @entity167 told @entity177			0
@entity168 president @entity167 has admitted that the club want to sign @entity7 's @entity172 ( left ) i am hearing @entity179 will consider the option of managing abroad next season			2
i understand @entity179 is virtually resigned to not being offered a new contract by @entity74 next season when his current deal expires in the summer			1
@entity179 has long been frustrated that he has been pigeonholed as a ' belts and braces ' manager when he believes he is a far more sophisticated coach than he is given credit for and has been at the vanguard of sports science innovation in the game			0
indeed he once claimed that had been foreign with a name like ' @entity193 ' then he would get more plaudits and bigger jobs			0
@entity74 boss @entity179 is considering managing abroad next season if he is not given a new contract @entity179 still harbours the ambition of being @entity149 coach having just missed out when @entity200 was given the job in 2010			1
@entity179 believes his cv could be enhanced by managing abroad - in @entity10 , @entity203 or @entity204			1
he will not be short of options in the @entity70 though - @entity206 and @entity160 are two possible destinations			0
or he could take some time out and see what job crops up in the autumn			0
@entity210 , who has rebuilt his reputation with @entity212 , is one of the candidates to replace @entity179 at @entity74 along with @entity214 of @entity215 and @entity217 's @entity216			2
@entity212 manager @entity210 is one of the candidates to replace @entity179 at @entity74 this summer i am also hearing @entity220 could be offered the chance of a swansong in @entity223 depending on which club have spaces when their transfer window opens in june			1
@entity220 , 36 , may also find he is in demand in other territories such as @entity229 and @entity230			0
@entity160 are unlikely to offer @entity220 a new contract when the one - year deal he signed after leaving @entity6 on a free last summer expires			2
@entity220 , currently out injured , has made just nine appearances for @entity235 this season			0
the former @entity149 captain 's other option is to retire and pursue a career in the media or in coaching			0
@entity160 defender @entity220 could be offered the chance to play in the @entity243 , @entity230 or @entity229 next season			0

sources in @entity10 suggest @entity8 could sell @entity0 this summer
the @entity249 winger is wanted by both @entity251 clubs and @entity5
@entity0 has a £ 75million release clause in his contract at the @entity65
@entity8 are keen to sign @entity19 *midfielder* @entity18
@entity105 could join @entity8 if @entity107 signs a new deal at @entity258
@entity110 may make a summer bid for @entity115 striker @entity117
@entity47 striker @entity164 is a target for @entity265 side @entity163
@entity179 could manage abroad if he leaves @entity74 this summer
