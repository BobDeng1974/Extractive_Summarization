@entity10 and @entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , were left baffled after designer fashions and other possessions like bracelets and earrings began gradually going missing			2
but mrs @entity18 , 29 , was left devastated after her mother spotted the family nanny @entity1 , 23 , on @entity9 - wearing her stolen clothes and jewels on nights out			1
mrs @entity18 looked at the @entity9 page and was stunned to see the images - some of which she was even tagged in			1
it is believed @entity27 stole around fifty items of clothing , four items of jewellery , a pair of designer sunglasses , designer luggage and various other belongings			1
the couple had been employing the nanny - known as @entity38 - to look after their two - year - old daughter @entity2 , but never suspected her as she was considered as ‘ one of the family ’			1
mrs @entity18 printed out the pictures and took them to the police - but was told more evidence was needed			1
the couple then decided to set up four cameras in the house and one outside and collected three days of footage that caught @entity27 in the act			1
@entity27 was found with the clothes and a stash of stolen jewellery when police searched her home in @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity11 and @entity18 with their daughter @entity2 , they are said to be devastated by what has happened @entity27 , now of @entity62 , @entity13 , admitted theft from employers at @entity65 and was ordered to do 200 hours unpaid community work			1
speaking after the hearing , mrs @entity18 said : ' every week random things were going missing			2
it really started getting to me and i thought i was going mad			1
' it did not add up			2
i started to make a list and realised just how much was going missing			2
' i hate myself for it now but i started thinking if anyone i knew would do this			0
i feel stupid but i never once considered it would be her			0
she had become part of the family			2
one of the pictures supplied to the police by the @entity83 , showing @entity1 , left , wearing stolen clothes ' @entity85 then looked on @entity38 ’s @entity9 account and i felt physically sick			1
in her profile picture she was wearing all of my clothes and was doing so in several others			2
@entity1 , 23 , admitted to the thefts at @entity65 ' i was even tagged in them			1
i do n’t know if she was just stupid or rubbing my nose in it			0
i have never felt so violated and my whole world came tumbling down			0
' mrs @entity18 said despite the @entity9 evidence , she till hoped @entity27 was n’t the one stealing the belongings			1
she said : ' i was still hoping it had been a big misunderstanding			0
i did n’t want to do any of it , but it was the only way we could prove anything			0
' but viewing the footage was like sitting down to watch a horror movie			0
' we thought we would be fast - forwarding a lot but within five minutes we caught her stealing a cardigan and putting it in her bag			1
' on each of the three days she stole from us			0
we allowed her to build a relationship with our daughter and be part of her everyday life			0
this was the ultimate betrayal			0
' mr and mrs @entity18 first met @entity27 , a qualified nanny , when she was working at a creche in november 2011			1
she took a shine to @entity2 and offered to do babysitting and after a few casual shifts , started looking after her a couple of times a week in january @entity83 said : ' we had her checked and she was highly regarded and professional trained as a nanny			1
two of the pictures of @entity27 wearing stolen clothes , they were handed to the police as evidence of the thefts ' she just seemed like a lovely girl and would update us hourly by text of photos of her with @entity2			1
' she helped me get ready on the morning of my wedding and was at my daughter ’s naming ceremony			0
' she became part of the family and it seemed the ideal arrangement			2
by summer she was working longer , we had upped her pay and she had all the freedom in the world			0
' in march 2012 , belongings started to go missing around the house , but it was after the couple ’s wedding day when jewellery given to @entity10 disappeared she started to panic			2
the @entity83 saw @entity27 as ' one of the family ' and are devastated she would break their trust in her judge @entity155 said it was a serious offence because it involved a breach of the trust which the couple had vested in her			1
mr @entity11 , 40 , who owns an electrical engineering firm , said @entity27 has shown no remorse or said sorry for her actions			1
he said : ' it makes my blood boil that she has not even apologised and has been laughing in our face			0
but she will have to live with a criminal record			0
' his wife said they had been badly affected by the whole episode but said @entity27 ’s sentencing was a way of putting a ' full stop ' on the ordeal			1
she said : ' we moved on a long time ago			0
but we can completely relax now knowing that justice has been served			0
' i have so much faith in the police system - they were amazing			2
but this really affected us bad			0
thankfully @entity2 was so young she will not remember any of this			0
' but i will not leave her with anyone now except for close family			2
she will be three in august and going off to pre-school this year so that should make things easier			0
' i just wish i had not let my guard down - i was just so convinced it was not her			0

@entity1 , 23 , admitted to the thefts after being caught on camera
couple never suspected nanny who they thought of as ' one of the family '
@entity27 posted pictures of herself on @entity9 wearing the stolen items , even tagging her *victim* in the *snaps*
police said photos were not enough evidence so couple used four cameras
@entity27 has been sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid community work
