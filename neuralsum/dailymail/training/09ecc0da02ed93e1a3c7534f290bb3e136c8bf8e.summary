in just six months , a camera technician lost nine and a half stone and has since gone on to become a fully qualified personal trainer			1
@entity3 , 24 , from @entity4 on @entity5 , had struggled with his weight for years , but was in denial about how large he had become			2
he said ; ' i had a really poor diet and did barely any exercise			0
' however , after a @entity22 shopping trip where i realised i had suddenly become a @entity23 in shirts i decided that enough was enough and i needed to make a change			0
' what started out as a simple @entity14 's resolution to join a gym and lose weight quickly turned into a single minded obsession			1
within six months @entity3 had gone from 23st to a much healthier 13st 7lb , dropping an astonishing 9st 7lb and totally transforming his body through a strict diet and exercise regime			1
@entity3 commented ; ' i completely changed my diet , found a regular training regime and with the help of my best friend and training partner , @entity36 , i battled through each session			2
' although he was happy with the results of his weight loss , the rapid transformation had left @entity3 looking gaunt and unhealthy			2
@entity3 's journey has seen him drop from 23st ( left ) to 13st 7lb before adding 2st of muscle to his frame ( right ) as a result , @entity3 decided he would attempt to gradually build up his weight in the form of muscle by undertaking weight training			1
he said ; ' i assessed my diet and training regime again and gradually built up my weight to just over 15st 7lb over the following 18 months			1
' i changed to phd pharma whey protein rather than the diet version , cut down on carbohydrates and started to eat six meals a day which mainly involved protein , vegetables and nuts			0
' with diet and exercise becoming such a central part of @entity3 's life , he decided to take the next step and pursue a career in fitness and health			1
@entity3 said ; ' i wanted to continue improving my own fitness but i also wanted to inspire others to do the same			0
' i could never picture myself the way i used to be and wanted to help others believe that it was possible too			0
i decided to take on the level 2 gym instructor and then the level 3 personal training courses			0
' becoming active and losing weight has completely changed my life			0
i never thought i would be in the position to help others to achieve what i have '			0
@entity3 currently balances his day job of being a camera technician with taking clients as a personal trainer after work and at the weekends			1
he is hoping to become a full time personal trainer once he has built up a large enough client base and one day in the near future hopes to open his own gym .			2
