by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 18:04 est , 1 january 2014 when @entity2 last led an @entity4 series 4 - 0 sir @entity5 was sitting alongside sir @entity6 in @entity7 when the tycoon proposed that the original urn should stay down under with the victors			1
seven years later , @entity11 pundit @entity5 still believes that should be the case , despite having tipped @entity14 to win this series 5 - 0			2
but @entity5 accepts that the original artefact is now too fragile to leave its home in the @entity18 ’s museum , having last been in @entity2 on an exhibition tour in 2006 - 07 when @entity14 were whitewashed			1
acknowledgment : sir @entity5 ( right ) accepts that the @entity4 urn should stay at @entity22 master publicist @entity6 taking the attention before the @entity24 had a lot to do with his @entity27 airline having been the official carrier for the @entity4 urn tour of @entity2			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , who have had no cricket dealings since , had discussed the urn staying while on the same boat in @entity7 harbour on @entity34			2
the @entity35 , who were repeatedly called the @entity37 by @entity6 , regard the urn as always having been a museum piece rather than a cricket trophy			0
plea : sir @entity6 ( centre ) , pictured in 2007 with @entity5 ( right ) and @entity43 , once called for the @entity4 urn to remain with the country of the victorious team @entity14 team director @entity46 promised a fresh intensity in preparations for the @entity24 after four defeats in a row			1
but the squad ’s shambolic appearance on wednesday gave no hint of a new dawn as @entity14 declined net practice at the @entity56 , preferring just a fielding stint instead			1
how much yet another net session would benefit the squad at this stage of a dismal tour is debatable			0
but with new players coming into the team for the last test , one would think every available opportunity to practise batting and bowling would be taken up — even if it meant arriving at the @entity56 at 8.30am on @entity68 rather than an hour later			2
practice : @entity14 's @entity46 speaks to his players during a nets session at the @entity56 it was also noticeable that @entity73 , the new managing director of @entity14 cricket , was not at the @entity56 on wednesday despite being in @entity7			1
@entity73 , who has the ultimate responsibility for @entity14 team issues , is due to sit down in the next week with @entity14 team director @entity46 to discuss the way forward for a national side humiliated in @entity2			1
chat : @entity46 is due to sit down for a discussion with managing director of @entity14 cricket @entity73 so it would surely have been beneficial for @entity73 to be present at the @entity56 to gauge the mood in the camp and training intensity , or lack of it , after four losses on the bounce			1
at least the new @entity14 national selector @entity90 was watching			0
@entity90 holds the dubious honour of having been @entity94 cricket correspondent @entity93 ’s fag at @entity95 , according to @entity93 ’ wife @entity96 in her daily tour blog			0
@entity98 , the @entity94 ’s useless rugby co-commentator and writer of an unreadable newspaper sports column , has made great play of lambasting @entity103 ’s admittedly amateurish video review of a day ’s play during the fourth test at @entity106 , done at the last minute to help out a colleague			0
this is the same @entity98 whose @entity110 dialogue yesterday included a post that read : ‘ oh , f * * * off , you p * * * *			0
’ also , @entity98 informed me at a @entity116 function — following some mild criticism of him — that the only reason he was n’t going to punch my lights out was because of concern i might call the police			0
@entity122 ’s a good sport @entity122 ’s captaincy is under huge scrutiny with his @entity14 team in danger of an @entity4 whitewash			2
but @entity122 could n’t be faulted for his sportsmanship at @entity132 pm @entity131 ’s reception for the two teams at his @entity7 residence @entity135			0
@entity122 said in his speech that despite the results , ‘ the hospitality we have received off the pitch has been exceptional ’			0
address : @entity14 captain @entity122 speaks at a @entity68 reception at @entity135 in @entity7 this contrasts with the view of @entity146 chairman @entity145 , who wants @entity147 to replace @entity148 as an @entity150 venue because of the hostility that greeted @entity14 in @entity152			1
there was a surprisingly friendly atmosphere between the rival teams , in part thanks to having their families there			2
it also helped that @entity161 , deputy chairman of the @entity146 and chairman of @entity163 , has such a high opinion of @entity165 after the @entity132 coach ’s 10 years playing at @entity167			0
friends for a day : both the @entity14 and @entity2 teams pose for a photo at @entity135			1

sir @entity5 accepts that the original @entity4 urn is too fragile to leave its home at @entity22
@entity14 declined net practice at the @entity56 on @entity68 , preferring a fielding session
