a widow whose husband was killed courageously fighting a wildfire in @entity3 , @entity4 five weeks ago is being denied the lifetime benefits she was counting on to raise the couple 's four young children alone			1
@entity9 's husband , @entity8 , was one of 19 @entity11 firefighters who lost their lives when a fire they were battling suddenly changed direction and engulfed them			1
mr @entity16 , like his colleagues , was protecting the people of @entity3 when he died , tragically leaving his young family without a husband , father or income			1
but the city of @entity23 , where the @entity24 were based , is now claiming he was a seasonal worker , despite him working a 40 hour week year round , and denying mrs @entity9 full benefits			1
all 19 hotshot families will receive worker 's compensation and a one - off federal payment of $ 328,000			1
but the city is refusing to pay mrs @entity9 her husband 's lifetime salary and health benefits , which together are worth millions , because it insists he was among 13 of the squad who were seasonal employees rather than full - timers			1
only six of the 19 firefighters are entitled to full - time benefits , the city claims			1
' i said to them , " my husband was a full - time employee , he went to work full - time for you , " ' she said , ' and their response to me was , " perhaps there was a communication issue in your marriage			2
" ' @entity38 has seen paperwork showing mr @entity16 did infact earn a full - time salary as a firefighter for the city of @entity23			1
he was the only one of the 13 @entity24 denied full benefits who worked a 40 hour week through out the year			1
in love : @entity9 , right , is pictured with @entity16 , left , in happier times heartbreaking : not only was @entity9 , pictured , devastated to lose her husband , she is now facing raising their four children without the benefits she is entitled to in a statement to @entity38 , @entity23 officials said the city had ' fully complied with all of the laws and employment polices that direct survivor benefits			1
' but mrs @entity9 , still mourning the loss of her 29 - year - old hero , is desperate for help , as the costs associated with bringing up four children mount			1
' quite literally , my bills are being paid by the good people of the world who are giving donations , because the city of @entity23 is n't doing anything for us , ' she told the tv station			1
' now i have four kids and myself , and i do n't know what i 'm going to do			0
' i want to be able to just be mourning my husband , be supporting my children , be figuring out what our new normal is			2
' the shocking treatment comes five weeks after the mother - of - four learned by watching the news that her firefighter husband had perished in the intense blaze that burned scores of homes to the ground			2
just days after the men 's deaths , mrs @entity9 revealed the last conversation she had with her husband - and her fears when he never responded to her text messages			1

she said she had been texting her husband throughout the day - with him telling her how much he loved and missed her , and how proud he was of their young children - until he abruptly stopped			1

' and of course there was no reply and they all laid out there that night			0
' she added that she had been sending him pictures of their children swimming that day , and how his daughter had commented that she wished he was there to see the thunder storm with them			2
he responded that he wished for that too			0
' we could sure use some rain over here , ' he said			0
mr @entity16 also sent his wife a picture of their view of the smoke and flames from his team 's lunch spot on sunday , and @entity9 said that she was not particularly concerned when she saw it			1
final moments : mrs @entity9 shared the final image @entity16 texted her before the 19 firefighters were killed by the flames an honorary flagpole is shown at the site where the 19 firefighters died the devastation has been described as a ' moonscape ' after an inferno so intense that only the metal part of one chain saw was found ' it still did not look as catastrophic as it turned out to be , ' she said			1
' but he let us know that he loved us and missed us			0
because of the dangers of the job , he would always tell us that he loved us			0
' family photographs reveal a picture perfect family as @entity9 and @entity8 are seen grinning and kissing , as well as laughing along with their four young children			1

as the bodies of the @entity254 were recovered , it emerged that the team 's 20th member survived as he was moving the crew 's truck when the flames overcame his comrades			1
helicopters had been unable to reach the highly - trained men as they fought the flames in @entity3 and they could not be saved by their emergency shelters - tent - like structures meant to shield them from flames and heat			0

we grieve for the department			0
we grieve for the city , ' he said at a news conference on june 30			1

' hot shot crews are elite firefighters who often hike for miles into the wilderness with chain saws and backpacks filled with heavy gear to build lines of protection between people and fires			2
they remove brush , trees and anything that might burn in the direction of homes and cities			0
the crew killed in the blaze had been working on other wildfires in recent weeks in @entity355 and @entity4 , @entity318 said .			0

@entity16 , 29 , died beside 18 of his ' @entity358 ' comrades on june 30
he left behind his young wife , @entity9 , and their four children , the youngest of whom is 18 months
five weeks after the tragedy , mrs @entity9 has been denied the full lifetime benefits she was *relying* on to raise the couple 's children
@entity371 of @entity23 claims the hotshot was one of 13 firefighters who were ' seasonal ' workers
they say she is therefore only entitled to worker 's compensation and a one off payment of $ 328,000
but mr @entity16 actually worked 40 hours a week all year round
