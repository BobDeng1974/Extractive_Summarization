a new series of @entity2 ads have been branded ' sexist ' and ' wrong ' for suggesting that women are manly if they do n't wax their body hair			1
the @entity6 commercials are part of a campaign with the tagline ' do n't risk dudeness ' , and they each show a hairy and overweight man playing the role of a woman who has suddenly realized she has body hair even though she ' shaved yesterday '			1
in one of the ads , a women stretches her leg over her boyfriend in bed			1
he strokes it , suddenly realizing it is stubbly , and the person he thought was his girlfriend is revealed as a man			1
' yeah , i know , i 'm a little prickly , ' says the girlfriend , who is played by a hair male actor ' yeah , i know , i 'm a little prickly , ' the actor says in a woman 's voice - over			1
' i shaved yesterday ... ' criticism has poured in since the ads first aired in the @entity6 on monday , with viewers branding them ' sexist ' , ' asinine ' and ' shameful '			1
' well , i wo n't be buying # veet products after that commercial , ' tweeted one woman			2
' shaving my legs is my choice and not doing so does not make me manly			2
' another wrote : ' shame on you # veet for preying on the insecurities of women and reinforcing false ideas of femininity			2
' body hair emergency : another ad features a woman lying on a stretcher in an ambulance			2
as an @entity63 cuts open her jeans , she pleads : ' please , not the panties ' backlash : a horrified viewer commented : ' the takeaway here is that women should feel ashamed of their own natural bodies , even in an emergency situation ? this is the most sickening ad i 've ever seen ' even men were appalled by the sexist message behind the videos , with one tweeting : ' if i were a woman , i would start growing my body hair out in protest			1
what an asinine commercial series			1
' each ad in the series implies that a woman should be ashamed and embarrassed by her body hair - whether it 's on her legs , armpits or bikini line			2
one of them shows a woman hailing a taxi , which pulls up to her , the driver grinning until he notices her hairy underarms			2
's * * * , i shaved yesterday , ' she says , and the driver winces and pulls away			2
sexism : another video shows a pretty woman hailing a taxi , which pulls up to her , the driver grinning @entity101 : but then the driver winces as he notices her hairy underarms			0
's * * * , i shaved yesterday , ' she says , and he drives away a third video from the campaign features a woman who has been in an accident and is lying on a stretcher in an ambulance			0
as an @entity63 cuts open her jeans , she pleads : ' please , not the panties			0
' a disgusted viewer commented on the video : ' the takeaway here is that women should feel ashamed of their own natural bodies , even in an emergency situation ? ' this is the most sickening ad i 've ever seen , ' she concluded			0
exposed : in the fourth ad , a woman has a pedicure , and the salon employee begins rolling up her trousers gender stereotype : but the woman morphs into a man when the pedicurist sees her unshaven legs , shouting with disgust : ' oh this is terrible ! terrible ! ' and in the fourth ad , a woman sits down to have a pedicure , but the salon employee appears disgusted by her unshaven legs , shouting : ' oh this is terrible ! terrible ! ' the videos call to mind vintage commercials with the antiquated message of encouraging women to use deodorant and other products with the sole purpose of appealing themselves to men			0
a spokesman for @entity2 said the adverts , which have only been aired in @entity151 , were not intended to offend , but that the company has decided to axe the campaign			1
she said : ' while the current advertising campaign for @entity2 running in the @entity6 has been well received by most consumers who appreciate its wacky , tongue in cheek humour , it has also provoked a great deal of comment			1
' we take our responsibilities very seriously and the ad was carefully reviewed before it aired			1
however we are very concerned by any misinterpretation of its tone or meaning , and in the light of the feedback received we have decided to withdraw it			1
' we would also like to apologise for any offense it may have caused			0
that was certainly not our intention			0
' the @entity2 ads call to mind vintage commercials that suggested women should use products like deodorant for the sole purpose of attracting men			1
indeed , deodorant was not widely used until around 1919 , when @entity183 , a copywriter for @entity184 of the original brands of deodorant - created an ad that changed attitudes to sweating and body odor			0
until then , the public did not see the need for deodorant , since underarm sweat was not viewed as a social faux pas			0
in fact , it was commonly believed that blocking perspiration was unhealthy			0
so in his copy , he presented ' excessive perspiration ' as a source of embarrassment : a woman ’s arm ! poets have sung of its grace ; artists have painted its beauty			0
it should be the daintiest , sweetest thing in the world			0
and yet , unfortunately , it is n’t always			0
many a woman who says , ‘ no , i am never annoyed by perspiration , ’ does not know the facts – does not realize how much sweeter and daintier she would be if she were entirely free from it .			0

criticism has poured in since the ads first aired on monday during @entity220 , with viewers branding them ' sexist ' , ' asinine ' and ' wrong '
@entity2 has since apologized and withdrawn the ads *due* to ' misinterpretation of its tone ' and ' in light of the feedback received '
