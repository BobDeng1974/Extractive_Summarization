size 16 model @entity0 made waves last month posing for @entity4 's summer swimwear campaign			1
the 5.10 " brunette was hired by the high street brand to show off the range of larger sizes that their beachwear collections come in ( @entity11 sizes 14 - 24 ) and the shots caused a stir because there was no obvious reference to the fabulous looking model 's size anywhere on the ads. the collection was simply presented to customers as ' this season 's new swimwear '			1
the only clue alluding to the line 's larger sizing was a small ' + ' sign sitting to the right of @entity4 's logo			2
@entity0 has been modelling full time since 2011 , after gaining 20lbs on the advice of a scout who spotted her volunteering at her local pet store as a teenager			1
she is now using her new found fame as an opportunity to promote positive body confidence in young women			1
size 16 model @entity0 made waves in the recent @entity4 campaign and is now using her fame to promote body confidence in young girls @entity0 has been modelling full time since 2011 , when she gained 20lbs on the advice of a scout she told the @entity46 : ' i was given the option to lose weight and try to maintain a size four ( a @entity52 six or eight ) , or to gain a little - maintain a size 10 ( a @entity52 12 or 14 ) - and start a career as a plus - size model			1
i knew my body was never meant to be a size four , so i went with plus			2
' people assume " plus " equates to fat , which in turn equates to ugly			0
' the 24 - year - old from @entity62 , has received thank you messages from lots of new fans since appearing in the @entity4 campaign who say that her confidence has inspired them to try on a bikini for the first time in years			1
she said : ' i found it strange that people made such a fuss about how my body looks in a bikini , since i do n't usually give it much thought but this is exactly the kind of thing i 've always wanted to accomplish , showing women that it 's ok to be confident even if you 're not the popular notion of " perfect "			2
' this message is especially important for teenage girls			0
being a teenage girl is incredibly difficult			0
they need all the help and support they can get			0
' the @entity4 campaign did n't make any reference to @entity0 's size and she says that it 's time we all stop obsessing about body shape @entity0 is on the books of the prestigious @entity97 agency in @entity98 now on the books of @entity98 's prestigious @entity100 admits that she found her teenage years difficult			1
she was 5ft 9in and a size 12 by the time she was 13 and envied the smaller girls at school			2
her thick , curly hair , braces and wire - rimmed glasses drew more unwanted attention and she now wants to show young women that it is acceptable to be different and that they will grow out of that awful awkwardness			1
she says : ' just focus on being the best possible version of yourself and quit worrying about your thighs , there 's nothing wrong with them			0
there 's no need to glamorise one body type and slam another			0
' we need to stop this absurd hatred towards bodies for being different sizes			0
it does n't help anyone and it 's getting old			0

she said : ' i think it sends a positive message about inclusivity and changing standards of beauty			0
' seeing plus - size bodies in fashion spreads and ads should be as common as seeing anything else			2
' @entity155 too praised the mega retailer , with some writing ' thank you ' notes to @entity4 's marketing department			2
one woman posted an open letter to @entity4 in @entity133 's comments section , writing : ' thank you so much for using @entity0 as your beachwear page covergirl			1
