billionaire @entity1 's groundbreaking private space firm @entity2 has been shaken up this past week by class action lawsuits filed on behalf of some angry former employees			1
the suits come less than a month after @entity2 laid off up to 400 employees who spokesmen claimed were ' low performers , ' but one of the suits says the unexpected mass terminations violated @entity13 law			1
the other suit suggests working conditions were n't ideal leading up to the lay - offs , anyway , with claims the company failed to provide employees -- even its technicians producing space rockets -- with state mandated lunch and rest breaks			1
giant leap ... to the curb ? two lawsuits claim billionaire @entity1 's @entity2 firm has violated @entity13 labor laws in the second suit , disgruntled employee @entity32 alleges the company failed to provide required half - hour lunch breaks after five hours of work followed by a second break after 10 hours , @entity31 reports			1
@entity32 's suit even claims @entity2 bilked him out of wages he was owed by forcing him to work off the clock and rounding down his reported hours to ' fewer total hours than were actually worked			2
' structural technicians @entity41 and @entity43 have also filed suit			0
they were part of the layoffs in late july when between 200 and 400 employees were shown the door			2
the plaintiffs say they were n't given a 60 - day notice of the upcoming layoffs , which would break @entity13 's @entity53			0
the law stipulates that companies with over 75 employees must provide the notice when letting go 50 or more workers			2
lawsuits claim the @entity60 , @entity13 company withheld lunch breaks and wages and violated @entity13 law by failing to forewarn employees of a mass layoff companies found to be in violation of the law are required to pay 60 days compensation and could face civil penalties , notes the @entity70			1
however , the former rocket techs ' case -- which they hope will become a civil suit covering all those who were laid off -- spins largely upon whether or not the shedding of employees was a ' lay off			0
' @entity2 has not qualified it as such			0
president @entity79 instead characterized it as the termination of ' low performers			0
' @entity41 and @entity43 are asking for back pay , the value of unrecieved benefits and penalties			0
mr. @entity32 also hopes his case will become a class action and is asking for unpaid wages , wages from the rest periods he missed and penalties .			1

two class action lawsuits have been filed against the @entity60 , @entity13 firm within the last week
one suit claims @entity2 failed to provide employees with the lunch breaks and rest periods *prescribed* by state law
another alleges the private space launch firm broke state law by failing to warn workers of an *impending* law - off of 200 - 400 employees
