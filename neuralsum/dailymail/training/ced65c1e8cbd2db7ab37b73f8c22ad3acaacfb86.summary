farmers are pressing supermarkets to give them permission to feed the nation ’s millions of egg laying hens a ‘ @entity8 ’ @entity7 diet			1
currently most supermarkets ban their suppliers from giving hens a genetically modified soya or corn			0
however , industry organisations , including the @entity15 , the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) and the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) are trying to change this			0
farmers are asking to be allowed to feed millions of egg - laying hens with genetically modified feed they say @entity24 feed is too expensive and have written directly to the supermarkets and the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) asking them to lift the ban			1
supporters of biotech farming insist the eggs produced from hens fed on @entity7 are identical to those given a natural diet , but this is disputed			1
eggs laid by hens raised in this way would not have to be labelled , so leaving shoppers completely in the dark about the food 's origins			2
critics say any such move would be completely at odds with the wishes of consumers , who have concerns about the impact of biotech farming on the countryside and human health			0
a recent @entity53 study also found that consumers want clear labelling of products produced from animals raised on @entity7 the farming organisations say the bans on @entity7 feed adopted by most retailers is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain			2
they say it is a problem to find @entity24 feed , while it tends to be more expensive			1
@entity65 and @entity66 have already bowed to farmer pressure and dropped their insistence on non @entity7 feed for hens , however other retailers have yet to follow			1
critics say consumers have concerns about biotech farming on the countryside and human health @entity78 , chairman of the @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , said non-gm soya costs around £ 100 per tonne more than the @entity7 equivalent , which is putting up industry costs and pointed out there is no such retailer ban on giving @entity7 feed to cattle and pigs			1
‘ this is not a requirement that is placed on other livestock sectors ; it is only the poultry sector that is required to use @entity7 , ’ he complained			0
‘ the premium that we are having to pay for non @entity7 soya has grown from £ 40 per tonne to £ 100 per tonne			0
‘ @entity97 soya growers are moving to @entity7 soya and there will soon about 10per cent non @entity7 – insufficient to meet all @entity100 supermarkets ’ demand for us to use non @entity7 feed			2
‘ they really do need to drop this requirement now			0
’ opponents of attempts to allow yet more @entity7 feed on to the nation ’s farms include the @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
they have written to the @entity26 warning any change in policy would be a ‘ serious mistake ’			0
they said : ‘ we believe , particularly in the wake of the scandal about unlabelled and unlisted ingredients in beef burgers , that this would be a very serious mistake , further undermining public trust in animal products sold by @entity100 supermarkets			0
’ the group said it was simply inaccurate to claim there is any shortage of @entity24 feed			1
the proportion of @entity24 soya being imported into the @entity133 is now increasing , and is currently around seven million tonnes a year			0
this is apparently in response to moves by @entity137 in @entity138 , and other retailers , particularly in countries like @entity141 and @entity142 , to move to @entity24 animal feed , and to label meat , dairy products , farmed fish and eggs as coming from animals fed on @entity24 feed .			1

supporters say eggs from @entity7 - fed hens are exactly the same
claim @entity24 feed has *soared* in price
critics say move would ' undermine consumer trust ' in their food
