by @entity0 as chief political correspondent for @entity3 , @entity1 is surely aware of the hazards posed by recording his reports within earshot of @entity7			1
the clocktower rings in every quarter hour and , on each and every hour of the day , the sound of its great bell resonates across @entity11 and beyond as it enumerates the time			0
but it seems to have nonetheless come as a surprise to the mr @entity1 when @entity7 's chimes came as he was in full flow of delineating the day 's events in politics			1
ever the professional : @entity20 delivers his report on @entity23 's trip to @entity24 but what 's this ? something dismays the veteran reporter who shuts his eyes in rage why you ! @entity1 turns his head to @entity7 , whose chimes have ruined his recorded segment ' oh , f * * * ing hell , ' he blurted , angrily turning his head to @entity7 in footage that was broadcast to the nation on @entity3 last night			1
mr @entity1 's obscene outburst prefaced a brief awkward silence followed by a quick cut back to the studio , where newsreader @entity43 was staring down the camera witheringly			1
' we do apologise for that , ' she said			0
' that was a much earlier recording and our apologies here from @entity3			2
moving on ... ' mr @entity1 had been trying to report on prime minister @entity23 's trip to @entity24 , @entity51 , to meet @entity53 leaders and discuss the rise of eurosceptic parties in last week 's elections to the @entity57			2
mr @entity1 had been trying to report on prime minister @entity23 's trip to @entity24 , @entity51 , to meet @entity53 leaders and discuss the rise of eurosceptic parties in last week 's @entity61 parliament elections ' oh , f * * * ing hell , ' he blurted , angrily turning his head to @entity7 as its peal began resonating across @entity11 oh dear : the viewers are treated to mr @entity1 's naughty boy face as he realises the obscenities he has uttered producers , it later emerged , had mistakenly aired an out - take			1
a full report , with no obscenities , was broadcast later			0
ms @entity43 later admitted on @entity74 to being ' slightly thrown ' by the unexpected expletive			0
she tweeted : ' we do apologise for that			0
the perils of distracting individuals being a nuisance whilst recording outdoors			0
we 're all human ! ' but it is in fact not the first time that mr @entity1 inadvertently turned the airwaves blue when discussing @entity86 politicians			2
in 2011 he accidentally called @entity87 a very disparaging name after getting his c 's mixed up with his h 's			1
not impressed : mr @entity1 's obscene outburst prefaced a brief awkward silence followed by a quick cut back to the studio , where newsreader @entity43 was staring down the camera witheringly having reminded @entity97 of the passing of time for the past more than 150 years , the resounding peals of @entity7 are a feature of the @entity103 capital 's soundscape that few could fail to anticipate			1
since 2012 the 315ft tower itself has officially been known as the @entity7 , in honour of the @entity108			2
it was raised as a part of @entity112 's design for a new @entity11 , after the old one was destroyed by fire on the night of october 16 , 1834			0
it takes its nickname , @entity7 , from the colloquial name for its 13Â½ - ton @entity119 , which hangs at its pinnacle and whose toll is one of the quintessential sounds of @entity123 .			0

newsreader forced to apologise after footage was broadcast on @entity3
@entity1 was reporting on @entity129 's visit to @entity24 when @entity7 cut in
in 2011 he mistakenly called @entity87 a c * * * after mixing his h 's and @entity133
