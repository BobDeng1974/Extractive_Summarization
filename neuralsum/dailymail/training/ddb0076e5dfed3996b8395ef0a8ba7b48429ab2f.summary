by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is wary of the effect the euphoria currently being experienced by @entity5 could have on his formula one world title rival 's bid for a home race triumph in @entity9 this weekend			1
@entity5 departed the @entity11 @entity10 on his first serious low of the campaign as he suffered his maiden retirement this season after finishing the opening eight races either as winner or runner - up			0
up for it : @entity2 feels @entity22 factor will boost his hopes at @entity9 @entity10 with @entity2 claiming victory on his own home soil at @entity28 , the gap between the duo was also slashed to just four points in the @entity9 's favour			1
but following that blow for @entity5 , in the space of a few days he then got married , watched @entity9 win the @entity22 and signed a new long - term contract with @entity35			1
in terms of attempting to wrest back the initiative from @entity38 , @entity5 could not have asked for more , and will now be buoyed by the backing of thousands of ecstatic @entity9 at @entity40			2
' for every driver when he goes into his home race he gets a boost , and i think @entity5 will have that extra boost this weekend , ' said @entity2			2
on the charge : @entity2 is just four points behind @entity9 @entity5 in @entity48 standings ' not least because @entity9 have just won the @entity22 and the whole country is on a serious high			1
' hopefully that will also have a positive effect on the whole team , as @entity54			0
' @entity5 , who concedes he has had a ' very positive week ' , is naturally hoping to tap into the positive vibe that has swept his country in @entity58 triumph			2
relishing the challenge : @entity2 arrives at the circuit in @entity40 on thursday ' the effort of the team as a whole , how they all played together was really great to see and that 's what helped them win the tournament , ' said @entity5			1
' that 's what we at @entity35 are trying to do as well , to really work well , everybody together , to make the most of it			0
' we 're also on the right track in that respect because to dominate the sport as we are doing indicates we work pretty well together as a team			0
' of course there 's room for improvement , but we 're going in the right direction			0
' the only low note for @entity5 over the past few days has been @entity80 putting a block on his planned helmet design for this weekend			1
@entity84 : @entity35 hospitality unit has been customised to celebrate @entity9 's @entity22 triumph following @entity9 's fourth @entity22 triumph via their 1 - 0 victory over @entity89 at the @entity90 in @entity91 , a thrilled @entity5 immediately sought to reflect his team 's achievement			1
on tuesday @entity5 tweeted a picture of the helmet he had planned to wear at @entity40 , resplendent with the colours of the @entity9 flag			2
primarily , it was adorned with four stars to indicate the number of times they have been crowned champions , whilst on top was an image of the @entity22			0
@entity80 , however , caught wind of the situation and contacted @entity5 's manager @entity108 to inform him his driver would have to remove the image due to an infringement of its intellectual property rights			1
defending its decision to ban the design , a @entity80 spokesperson said : ' @entity80 is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context			0
' if @entity80 would not follow up on any potential infringements of its intellectual property , it would risk losing its legal right and title to such works , thereby endangering the foundation of its commercial programme which is driven primarily by the access to and usage of our brand marks , including the @entity22 trophy			1
no way : @entity80 have blocked @entity5 wearing special @entity22 helmet ' an example of the strength of @entity80 's intellectual property assets is reflected by recent research in seven key global markets where the @entity22 trophy recorded an average recognition level of 83 per cent			1
' these levels are significantly higher than any other sporting trophies			0
' as a result , we can not allow a commercially branded helmet to feature the @entity22 trophy as this would jeopardise the rights of our commercial affiliates			2
' we appreciate @entity5 's desire to congratulate the @entity9 team and have therefore been in discussions with the @entity5 team to attempt to find a solution , whereby he is still able to show his support for @entity9 without using @entity80 intellectual property in a commercial context			1
' @entity5 conceded to being caught by surprise by @entity80 's regulations , saying : ' @entity159 as a trademark - these are the kind of things you have to think of			2
' i was surprised but of course i fully understand			0
it was a pity because the helmet looked really cool with the trophy on top			0
' i 've replaced it now with a big star and no - one can take that away			0
the star is ours ! '			0

@entity2 hopes @entity22 triumph will boost his @entity35 team
@entity2 just four points behind @entity9 @entity5 in @entity48 standings
