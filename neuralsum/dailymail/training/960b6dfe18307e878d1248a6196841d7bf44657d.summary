@entity23 's defense filed an appeal shortly after he was convicted of first - degree murder in may , but it was denied			1
according to @entity30 , @entity29 circuit judge @entity28 told @entity23 : ' your soul is as barren as dark space			2
' the sentencing came a little more than two months after a jury convicted @entity23 in the october 24 , 2008 shooting deaths of @entity9 's 57 - year - old mother @entity38 , her 29 - year - old brother @entity39 and her 7 - year - old nephew @entity15			1
some of the jurors spoke to the press following their decision , saying that phone records were the tipping point amid a sea of circumstantial evidence			0
the evidence that helped seal @entity23 ’s fate was the testimony from a forensic investigator who told the court how he triangulated @entity23 ’s location using cell phone towers			1
‘ once we were able to piece the timing together … we were able to put a timeline together , ’ juror @entity54 said , according to @entity55			0
' we realised that he could not be at two places at one time			0
' victimised : @entity15 , pictured performing earlier this month , was present for the sentencing of @entity23 in @entity64 crushed : @entity65 , center , mother of @entity23 , hides her face from photographers after her son was found guilty of the three murders prosecutors portrayed @entity23 as a jealous estranged husband who often stalked @entity74 's house after he moved out in early 2008			1
they said all his anger and jealousy erupted into violence shortly after he came into the house and spotted a gift of balloons there that were from @entity74 's new boyfriend			0
they told jurors that after @entity74 left the house for her job as a bus driver the morning of october 24 , @entity23 returned with a .45 - caliber handgun and shot @entity9 's mother in the back , and then shot @entity9 's brother twice in the head as he lay in bed			1

opposites : @entity15 , right , holds her @entity16 while and convicted murderer @entity23 , is seen clutching a bottle of champagne weeping : a courtroom sketch shows @entity15 and sister @entity109 reacting to the closing arguments in the murder trial the boy 's body was found in the abandoned vehicle miles away after a three - day search			1
the case against @entity23 was built largely on circumstantial evidence , with witnesses testifying that the shootings were the final chapter of a story that was laid out to them by @entity23 himself in alleged threats that he would kill @entity74 's family if she spurned him			1
@entity74 was among those who testified about the alleged threats @entity23 made against her family , telling jurors that he was so prone to jealousy that he even angrily complained when her young son kissed her			2
' he said , ` if you leave me , you will be the last to die			0
i 'll kill your family first , ' she testified			0
in memoriam : @entity15 , left , is seen pictured with her murdered mom , centre , and sister @entity109			2
it is captioned : ' my lovely mother , beautiful sister julia and i ' victims : @entity15 's brother @entity39 , left , and nephew @entity15 , right , were also killed in the brutal 2008 triple murder other witnesses told similar stories , with one saying that @entity23 ' went on a rant ' in august 2008 about his estranged wife in which he repeatedly threatened to kill the family			1
another said he saw @entity23 spying on his estranged wife from outside her house			0
a former girlfriend of @entity23 testified that @entity23 told her he had shot and killed @entity9 's family members and that she 'd agreed to serve as his alibi if police inquired out of fear he would harm her			2
some of the most dramatic testimony came from @entity15			2
the singer , who won an @entity16 for her role in the 2007 film ' dreamgirls , ' was the first witness to testify			2
' i tried to keep my distance from @entity23 , ' she told jurors when asked if she was ever friends with @entity23 , whom she 'd known since junior high school			0
but @entity23 's attorneys suggested that someone else committed a crime in the family 's three - story house in @entity173 on @entity64 's @entity174			1
@entity176 tragedy : the body of @entity15 's missing nephew was found in the back of a white suv , three days after he had vanished the way they told it , someone other than @entity23 targeted the family because of alleged crack - cocaine dealing by @entity9 's brother			1
but when it came time to present evidence , @entity23 's attorneys only called two witnesses in 30 minutes of testimony and never presented any evidence to support that theory			1
even if the suggestion did not sway jurors , it did underscore the violence that plagues the family 's small neighborhood on the city 's @entity174 , a community where children grow up knowing the sound of gunfire , a sound so common that residents often do n't even bother reporting it to cops			0
a high school dropout and member of a street gang , @entity23 had a long rap sheet for drug offenses and automobile theft when he was arrested and convicted for attempted murder and vehicular hijacking			2
after seven years in prison he was released in 2006			0
a few months later he married @entity74 , at about the same time @entity15 was starring in ' dreamgirls			0
