@entity0 this week heads into his first @entity1 in two - and - a - half years without @entity2 in his corner — but his former @entity5 mentor will still cast a considerable shadow			1
the @entity8 champion , whose @entity10 first - round match against @entity12 ’s @entity11 will take place either monday or tuesday , has revealed he is seeking @entity2 ’s advice about how to approach the clay - court @entity1			1
@entity0 has stuttered this season , but was buoyed by his performance in @entity17 a week last friday , when he almost beat the king of clay himself , @entity18 , in the quarter - final			1
‘ i ’ve messaged him a little bit and he actually called me the day after my match with @entity18 in @entity17 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he spoke to @entity36 [ @entity37 , @entity0 ’s assistant coach ] and then fired some messages my way			1
i might call him today just to have a little chat			0
’ training hard : @entity0 has spoken to @entity2 ahead of the @entity10 which starts on sunday @entity2 , who this weekend is playing a veterans ’ event in @entity44 , was happy to give his appraisal of what happened against @entity18 , who @entity0 led 4 - 2 in the deciding set before being reined in			1
‘ he messaged @entity36 before the match and then afterwards , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ he was saying the first set for me was obviously great tennis			0
that it was very close and i should be encouraged by that coming into this event			0
it is just the details i ’ve not spoken to him about			0
’ @entity55 words : under @entity2 ( right ) @entity0 ( left ) won the @entity56 and @entity8 in successive years @entity0 says he is close to appointing a coach , although he has sent out so many contradictory signals about the matter that you suspect he might be enjoying the speculation			1
what he is clear about is that the candidate — or candidates , depending on which interview he has given — do not include the recommendations @entity2 originally gave			2
‘ the people he suggested are people i respect and they are very good coaches as well , but i do n’t think it will be one of them , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i spoke to @entity2 about it when we originally split up , just before @entity70			1
i obviously listened but ultimately it needs to come from me			0
’ for now @entity0 is content working with the rest of his team and if he needs a sounding board he turns to @entity75 , who used to coach @entity76			1
@entity75 is available to help anyone sponsored by adidas , and he is trusted by the @entity29			0
‘ when i have n’t had a coach he ’s come to a load of my practices , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ also , when @entity2 was around he ’d just come along and watch			2
i have a good relationship with him and i enjoyed working with him			0
moving on : @entity0 ( left ) has been coached largely by @entity83 ( right ) since @entity2 's departure ‘ in the times i ’ve been in this situation before , the person i spent time talking to and being around was @entity75 , and i would rather stick with something i know			1
‘ but not coming with a main coach , maybe there is a little bit more pressure			0
but i feel like even when i ’ve not been playing so well , when there has been pressure on me it ’s helped me raise my game , it ’s helped me get nervous and excited to get going			0
so i hope that ’s the case here			0
' when i go to the gym , and if i ’m struggling in a session or anything , it ’s always these events that make me want to keep going , to push through the hard training sessions and put in the hours			0
' so each time i arrive at one of these events i feel very motivated , especially this time after missing last year			2
’ next up : @entity0 will play @entity12 's @entity11 in the first round of the @entity10 @entity0 has a history of lifting his game for @entity1 regardless of previous form and he anticipates his main rivals will do the same after a clay - court season that has not been predictable due to the relative struggles of @entity18			1
asked about his rivals ’ prospects , @entity0 replied : ‘ i do n’t really care			2
i would expect @entity18 and @entity118 [ @entity119 ] to play great tennis here , i ’d also expect @entity113 [ @entity114 ] to play very well			2
' there ’s nothing to suggest all of a sudden they ’re going to stop performing well in the @entity1			0
who wins depends on who plays best at the end of the event			0
’ familiar face : @entity0 ( left ) could face defending champion @entity18 in the semi-finals at @entity10 there is a good chance for @entity0 to make the second week , but for the first time in eight years @entity18 is not the favourite , with @entity119 narrowly more fancied			1
this is the tournament that the @entity137 wants to win more than any other , and he must feel that there is no better time to lift the trophy .			0

@entity0 says he has sought former coach @entity2 's advice for this year 's @entity10
@entity0 and @entity2 split in march
@entity0 won @entity8 and the @entity56 in their time together
@entity0 will face @entity11 in the first round at @entity10
@entity18 could be a semi-final *opponent* for @entity0
