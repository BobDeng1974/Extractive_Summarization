a federal indictment unsealed in @entity11 today claims @entity3 well site leaders @entity12 and @entity14 acted negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the rig before the explosion			2
the indictment says @entity12 and @entity14 failed to phone engineers onshore to notify them of problems in the drilling operation			0
another indictment charges @entity62 , who was @entity3 's vice president of exploration for the @entity28 , on charges of obstruction of @entity66 and false statements			1
the indictment claims the former executive lied to federal investigators when they asked him how he calculated a flow rate estimate for @entity3 's blown - out well in the days after the april 2010 disaster			2
the @entity74 - based oil giant also agreed to pay the largest fine in @entity31 history - a total of $ 4.5billion settlement with authorities for claims relating to the spill			1
legal fight : attorney general @entity83 said the $ 4.5billion settlement and indictments are n't the end of federal authorities ' efforts and that the criminal investigation against @entity3 is continuing @entity54 and @entity60 heartbreak : @entity90 , left , and @entity91 , right , perished in the explosion at a news conference today , attorney general @entity83 called @entity3 ' largest total criminal resolution in the history of the @entity31			1
' he added that the settlement and indictments are n't the end of federal authorities ' efforts and that the criminal investigation against @entity3 is continuing @entity3 will pay the fine over six years after reaching a deal with the @entity31 @entity102 ( @entity102 ) and the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) that has seen it plead guilty to 14 criminal charges relating to the oil rig accident in 2010 , which dumped millions of barrels of oil into the @entity28			1
lives cut short : @entity52 left behind a wife after the explosion , while @entity57 , right , had three children loss : at 22 , @entity112 was the youngest victim of the disaster tainted : the explosion caused the spill of more than 200 million gallons of oil into the @entity28 ' we believe this resolution is in the best interest of @entity3 and its shareholders , ' said @entity121 , @entity3 chairman			1
' it removes two significant legal risks and allows us to vigorously defend the company against the remaining civil claims			0
' the settlement , which is subject to approval by a federal judge , includes payments of nearly $ 2.4 billion to the @entity129 , $ 350million to the @entity130 and about $ 500million to the @entity103			0
@entity131 , chief executive of @entity3 , said : ' we apologize for our role in the accident and as today 's resolution with the @entity31 government further reflects , we have accepted responsibility for our actions			1
' @entity138 : an oil slick covered 68,000 square miles of the gulf and washed ashore along 1,072 miles of coastline under the deal , @entity3 has also pleaded guilty to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect and three misdemeanour counts - including one under the @entity147 and one for obstructing @entity66			1
the record - breaking fine surpasses even the $ 1.3billion fine paid by drugs group @entity149 in 2009 for marketing fraud related to a pain medicine			1
@entity3 will pay $ 4billion dollars to the @entity102 in installments over five years			2
it will pay an additional $ 525million to the @entity103 over a period of three years			0
@entity3 will make the first payment of $ 175million this year to the @entity103 the group has already paid out more than $ 38billion relating to the oil spill			1
@entity3 is hoping to wrap up its financial liabilities from the @entity8 disaster , but the overall impact on the @entity160 is still not known by researchers			1
oil spewed into the @entity28 from the @entity163 for 87 days before it was finally capped			2
some 68,000 square miles of the gulf were at one time covered in oil slick , about the area of @entity168			0
more than 6,000 seabirds , 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill			0
many dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination and zooplankton have recently found to show traces of oil , as well			0
the full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the government releases its @entity182 , which will collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf			0
mr @entity131 said : ' all of us at @entity3 deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the @entity8 accident as well as the impact of the spill on the @entity160 region			1
' he added : ' since the spill , we have worked hard to rebuild confidence in the company			0
' we take seriously not only our commitment to safety and operational excellence but also our communications with stakeholders , including the public , the government and our investors			0
' today 's settlement removes some of the uncertainty hanging over the stock since the disaster , but it does not cover outstanding civil claims against the group			0
@entity3 said it will ' continue to vigorously defend itself ' against civil claims and allegations of gross negligence			0
' we are open to settlements , but only on reasonable terms , ' said mr @entity131			0
the deal could resolve a significant share of the liability that @entity3 faces after an explosion killed 11 workers and fouled the shorelines of four @entity160 states in the worst offshore spill in @entity31 history			1
@entity3 still faces economic and environmental damage claims sought by @entity31 @entity160 states and other private plaintiffs			1
it is unclear what form of criminal misconduct @entity3 will plead guilty to			2
in an august filing , the @entity102 said ' reckless management ' of the @entity163 ' constituted gross negligence and willful misconduct , ' which it intended to prove at a pending civil trial set to begin in @entity11 in february 2013			0
the @entity31 government has not yet filed any criminal charges in the case			1
it is unclear whether the deal will resolve any civil charges brought by the @entity102			0
it is also unclear how large a financial penalty @entity3 might pay to resolve the charges , or other punishments that @entity3 might face			2
negligence is a central issue to @entity3 's potential liability			0
a gross negligence finding could nearly quadruple the civil damages owed by @entity3 under the @entity147 to $ 21billion in a straight - line calculation			2
sickly : thousands of birds , reptiles and dolphins died in the oil slick and many are still showing signs of contamination according to the @entity102 , errors made by @entity3 and @entity260 - based @entity259 , owner of the @entity8 platform , in deciphering a key pressure test of the @entity163 are a clear indication of gross negligence			1
' that such a simple , yet fundamental and safety - critical test could have been so stunningly , blindingly botched in so many ways , by so many people , demonstrates gross negligence , ' the government said in its august filing			0
the mile - deep @entity163 well spewed 4.9million barrels of oil into the @entity28 over a period of 87 days			1
the torrent fouled shorelines from @entity277 to @entity278 and eclipsed @entity280 's 1989 @entity279 in severity			0
@entity3 has already announced an uncapped class - action settlement with private plaintiffs that the company estimates will cost $ 7.8billion to resolve litigation brought by over 100,000 individuals and businesses claiming economic and medical damages from the spill .			2
