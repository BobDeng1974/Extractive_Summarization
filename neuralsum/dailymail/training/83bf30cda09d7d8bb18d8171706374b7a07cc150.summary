by @entity0 food giant @entity1 has been fined £ 50,000 after an engineer had his right hand sliced off by a potato peeling machine			1
surgeons had to operate eight times on @entity7 's stump - leaving him unable to drive , work or live normally - after he was maimed during routine maintenance last june			2
the 49 - year - old 's accident sparked a major health and safety investigation at @entity1 's @entity14 plant in @entity15 , @entity16 , one of its five @entity19 factories , and he is now suing the firm			1
maimed : surgeons had to operate on @entity7 's stump eight times , leaving him only with a rudimentary mechanical claw			2
@entity1 admitted safety breaches and the engineer is now suing the firm known as @entity27 , mr @entity7 was servicing the machine when he climbed down to fetch a bolt which he had dropped through the peeler into its slurry pump			1
he had switched off the peeler before working , and he thought the pump - which is used to clear away excess peelings - was connected to the same circuit			0
but it was not , and the pump began running while the engineer 's right hand was inside			1
it sliced off his hand at the wrist and left him in hospital for two weeks			0
now he has just a rudimentary mechanical claw			0
to make matters worse , mr @entity7 's caravan on the @entity16 coast was then washed away by storms in december - leaving him homeless			1
failings : the accident happened at @entity1 's @entity14 plant in @entity15 , @entity16 , one of its five @entity19 factories an investigation by the @entity55 found the pump and the peeler had appeared to be part of the same system , even though they were not			1
the @entity55 also established there was no protective grate to stop the self - employed engineer reaching into the pump			0
food giant : @entity1 apologised for the incident @entity1 was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to health and safety breaches yesterday at @entity68			2
mr @entity7 's solicitor @entity69 told @entity70 : ' he 's been pursuing a civil claim since the incident occurred so hopefully we will now be able to conclude that more quickly			2
' the impact of losing his dominant hand has been pretty catastrophic			1
' he 's a mechanical and electrical engineer and also ran a micro brewery as a sideline , but both of those were physical , dextrous work that needed both his hands			0
' he 's an active , outdoors type man , not an office computer kind of guy			0
he 's already 49 - what kind of work is he going to be able to find ? ' the ketchup , baked beans and soup giant was fined £ 50,000 and ordered to pay costs of £ 9,661			1
the firm - which mr @entity69 said had co-operated fully throughout - admitted one count of breaching regulation 11 ( 1 ) of the @entity94 1998			0
after the hearing @entity55 inspector @entity95 said : ' @entity97 suffered a horrific injury in an incident that was wholly avoidable			0
' mr @entity7 was put at risk by @entity1 's inadequate assessment of risks and lack of effective measures to stop access to dangerous parts of equipment			2
doubly unlucky : to make matters even worse , mr @entity7 's caravan home was washed away by storms ' sadly in this case @entity1 failed to protect mr @entity7 while he was contracted to carry out maintenance work at their @entity14 plant and , as a result , he has suffered a life - changing injury			1
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' safety is always our first concern			0
' although a safe system for maintenance work was in place , further measures have been adopted to ensure that such a regrettable accident could not happen again			0
