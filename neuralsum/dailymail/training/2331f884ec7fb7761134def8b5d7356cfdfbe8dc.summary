this is the moment a brave buffalo charged three lions after they grabbed a young calf from the herd			1
the hungry lions crept up on the buffalo and calf in north - west @entity8 , @entity9 , causing them to disperse in a terrifying 90 - second ordeal			1

but the big buffalo rallied and stood between her young and the lion 's teeth while charging horns - first at the circling predators			1
three lions took the opportunity to surround their prey and closed in on the calf			2
but the outnumbered buffalo could not hold them at bay and a young lion pounced and snapped away the baby between its jaws			1
the buffalo become separated from the herd when it turns back to face the lions and protect its young calf while the buffalo stands up to two of the lions , a third big cat approaches from behind to close in on the calf only the quick - thinking reactions of the the adult buffalo saved young calf from death			1
