by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 appear to have duped president @entity3 into participating in their latest questionable promotional stunt			1
the supposedly spontaneous selfie the @entity8 hitter snapped with a smiling @entity3 on the @entity10 lawn on tuesday was in fact sponsored by the @entity13 tech - giant as part of a new commercial relationship between the two			1
what had initially seemed a genuine part of the 2013 @entity20 winner 's celebrations was confirmed to be an advertising campaign that brought a curt response from @entity23 , the @entity10 spokesman and himself a diehard @entity8 fan			1
proving as gleefully off - the - cuff as @entity50 ' ' @entity28 ever ' at the @entity49 , @entity1 confirmed to @entity52 that they and the @entity8 player had conspired to snap the photo which was re-tweeted almost 40,000 times through @entity2 's @entity57 account			1
claiming they were ' thrilled to see the special historic moment @entity2 captured with his @entity59 ' , @entity1 said that ' similar to the selfie @entity50 was able to capture during the @entity49 , this was an opportunity for @entity2 to share the incredible moment			2
' however , @entity1 said that a selfie with @entity3 was not specifically planned , although it would have obviously been top of the list of a @entity10 visit			2
presentation : @entity2 ( @entity35 ) holds a @entity8 jersey for president @entity3 during a ceremony on the @entity41 of the @entity10 to honor the 2013 @entity20 champions thanks ! @entity2 embraces @entity38 president @entity3 during a ceremony on the @entity41 of the @entity10 on tuesday ' we didnâ € ™ t know if or what he would be able to capture using his note 3 device , ' the company said tuesday in a statement , the @entity72 reported wednesday			1
@entity1 did admit that prior to the @entity8 anticipated visit to the @entity10 where they presented the president with his own ' 44 ' jersey , they ' worked with @entity2 and the team on how to share images with fans			2
' @entity2 grabbed the opportunity for his presidential selfie during the middle of the ceremony photo - op on tuesday , asking @entity3 , ' actually , would you mind if i take my own ? ' tellingly , one of his teammates yelled out , ' cha - ching ' - possibly indicating he knew of the deal @entity2 had signed with @entity1 , which was announced on monday			1
he quickly posted the picture , writing , ' what an honor ! thanks for the # selfie , @ @entity3			0
' team mate selfie : @entity2 also took the opportunity to snap some pictures of him and his victorious 2013 @entity8 colleagues during their visit to the @entity10 while the picture did n't come close to @entity50 's record of 3.4 million retweets , @entity1 @entity38 immediately retweeted the picture to its 5 million followers , writing : ' @entity110 , @entity111			1
' @entity1 @entity38 were quick to tell its followers that the phone the shot was taken with			0
it retails for up to $ 700 on @entity115 , dependent on the contract			0
as @entity57 users quickly wised up to what was going on , they asked @entity1 @entity38 's account what had happened			0
' this photo was taken with a # @entity123 , ' @entity1 immediately tweeted			0
switching phones : while @entity2 enjoyed his day out in @entity42 - taking pictures on his @entity127 - as late as february he was still using his @entity128 ( right ) the @entity10 assiduously guards the presidents image and as @entity23 commented , had no idea about the selfie			0
however , while @entity2 may now be tied into a commercial partnership with @entity1 - as little as one month ago he was uploading pictures to @entity57 using an @entity128			0
this is similar to the situation @entity136 faced with @entity137 taking pictures during the televised @entity49 's with a @entity1 and then tweeting backstage pictures with her @entity128			0
on an appearance on @entity50 in march , president @entity3 joked that her famous @entity142 selfie was a ' pretty cheap stunt '			2
best selfie ever : @entity50 's a-list @entity49 's picture literally broke @entity57 when she uploaded this celebrity laden picture during the ceremony			1
