by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 5 august 2013 you could say their garden is a bit of a jungle ... in the nicest possible way , of course			0
for as they spend up to 12 hours a day between them tending their precious plot , pensioners @entity12 and @entity13 could never be accused of letting it get overgrown			1
with 18ft windmill palms native to the @entity21 towering into the sky , tree ferns from @entity17 , cordylines and fig trees , it does , however , look like it ought to be sited somewhere tropical			1
@entity23 : @entity12 and @entity13 have spent £ 10,000 on tropical plants to create a paradise in their back yard you might need a bigger watering can : the plants and 18ft palm trees require constant attention and keep the retired couple busy for up to 12 hours a day in awe : the couple look up at the canopy of a palm tree and survey their beautiful garden ( left )			1
mr @entity39 has grown award - winning dahlias and vegetables			0
his wife @entity42 ( right ) considers herself the deputy gardener of the pair or at @entity45 or as an exhibit at the @entity47 , at the very least			0
but in fact this little piece of paradise has far , far humbler roots			0
to reach it , you just have to step out of the back door of @entity39 and mrs @entity13 ’s red - brick detached house in the suburbs of @entity57			1
it is a far cry from what was there when the couple bought the newly built three - bedroom property in a residential street in 1966 for £ 3,150 and moved in after their wedding			1
back then , the most eye - catching site in the 750sq yard back garden was the clothes drying on the washing line			2
but they immediately set about transforming the patch of scrub - and right away were so dedicated to the garden that at the start of their marriage they had no stair carpet because they preferred to spend their money on a greenhouse instead			2
mrs @entity13 , 67 , a former care worker , said : ‘ i had to scrub the stairs on my hands and knees for two years , but i had beautiful tomatoes on the table			1
’ they first transformed it into a typical @entity91 suburban garden			0
mr @entity39 , who worked as a @entity93 engineer , grew dahlias and picked up countless rosettes for his vegetables at horticultural shows			0
it was 15 years ago that , having raised their son @entity101 and become grandparents , they decided to switch to the tropical paradise look			1
keeping up with the @entity105 : the @entity13 's neighbours will have a hard time catching up on the 15 years spent planting and tending to their tropical garden then and now : the sparse garden 's main feature was a humble clothes line when the couple bought the property 46 years ago ( left )			1
they have transformed it into a spectacular paradise ( right ) mr @entity39 , 73 , designed it himself and since then they have spent an estimated £ 10,000 stocking it with its fabulous foliage			1
neither of them has ever actually visited a tropical country , so mr @entity39 relied on his imagination to plan the lush haven			0
dazzling red bishop of @entity130 dahlias remain as a reminder of the more traditional style , and there is also a fish pond , a waterfall , a lion head fountain and a decking area in the south - facing garden			0
‘ @entity12 ’s hip had started to play him up so we decided to create a different garden , one with less digging and less work			1
at least that ’s what we thought then - but i ’m not so sure now , ’ said mrs @entity13			2
‘ we can do up to six hours each a day quite easily			2
@entity12 is head gardener and i ’m his deputy			2
you soon know if you miss a day - it quickly shows			0
’ while the results of their efforts are gloriously plain to see , their own little ‘ @entity152 ’ has not been without its hiccups			0
to their dismay , the severe winter of 2010 ravaged many of their prized tropical plants and they lost several , including 6ft tree ferns , to the cold weather			1
unassuming : the couple bought their home in @entity57 in 1966 , when they designed their garden in the traditional style			1
they were so keen on the pastime , they went without carpet for their stairs so they could afford a greenhouse dazzling dahlias : the striking red bishop of @entity130 dahlias stand out against the garden of green foliage they were so upset that at times , they say , they wondered if they could carry on			2
but they have replaced plants and restored the garden to its lush former glory once more			2
they now take extra care to protect the plants in winter and have picked up some unusual tips , including wrapping duvets around tree trunks to keep them warm when the mercury plunges			1
so what motivates them to do it ? ‘ what this garden does to people , you can see it in their faces			0
it ’s a stunning and tranquil place , ’ said mrs @entity13			0
mr @entity39 added : ‘ it takes you on a journey			0
a garden is the journey of your life			0

@entity12 and @entity13 spend up to 12 hours a day tending to their 18ft palm trees in their @entity57 home
retired couple have spent £ 10,000 in the last 15 years filling their 750 sq yard garden with tropical plants
keen gardeners wrap duvets around tropical trees to protect them when the weather turns cold
