@entity1 's most active volcano @entity2 has erupted - spewing molten lava thousand of feet above the @entity5 countryside			1
the eruption , which was captured on camera from @entity8 , near @entity9 , sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the @entity14 island last night			1
the breathtaking footage shows the volatile volcano emitting streams of hot lava from the earth 's core			2
it is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year powerful : the eruption sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the @entity14 island last night - forcing airport officials to close airspace over @entity2 the explosion - which is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain			1
however , staff at @entity47 have been forced to close airspace above @entity2 , which is the largest and most active volcano in @entity1			0
this is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft , as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass			0
this would ultimately cause the planes ' engines to shut down			0
incredible : the explosion - which lit up the @entity5 sky - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain @entity2 's last major eruption was in 1992 - causing a fast - flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain			1
despite the town of @entity69 being endangered by the streams of the red - hot liquid , successful diversion efforts saved the town and only one building was destroyed			0
however , the fiery volcano , currently standing at 10,925 feet tall , is still in constant activity			1
astonishingly , it is steadily growing , and has been for 500,000 years , when eruptions began			0
its latest eruption was preceded by a violent tremour on monday , which sent hundreds of perfect smoke rings into the air			1
risk : however , staff at @entity47 have been forced to close airspace above @entity2 , which is the largest and most active volcano in @entity1 danger : this is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft , as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass			2
this would ultimately cause the planes ' engines to shut down no signs of stopping : the fiery volcano is still in constant activity			0
it is situated on the geological boundary where the @entity1 and @entity104 plates collide experts believe the eruption may have sparked a change in the structure of a vent , perhaps into a particularly circular shape - allowing @entity2 to spew the unusual smoke - like formations			2
the volcano , which came into existence almost one million years ago , has been well - documented since @entity114 , when its eruptions forced civilians to migrate for safety			0
since then , there have been more than 200 eruptions - from the almost undetectable to the catastrophic			0
in 122 @entity121 , an explosive eruption spewed so much ash onto the town of @entity124 - crushing hundreds of houses - that the town 's inhabitants were exempted from paying taxes to @entity129 for ten years			2
horrific : @entity2 's last major eruption was in 1992 , pictured , causing a fast - flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain the most powerful eruption to date was in 1669 , when the explosions destroyed part of the summit and the lava flows reached the sea more than ten miles away			1
this disaster prompted town leaders to attempt to control the flows of lava - to no avail			0
an extremely violent eruption in 1852 produced more than 2 billion cubic feet of lava and covered more than three square miles of the volcano 's base , while the longest eruption began in 1979 and went on for thirteen years			1
near - miss : the town of @entity69 was endangered by the streams of the red - hot liquid ; however , successful diversion efforts saved the town from much damage @entity2 's current activity consists of continuous summit degassing , explosive @entity159 eruptions , and frequent basaltic lava flows			2
it has proved a constant concern for @entity5 - with more than 25 per cent of the island 's population living on @entity2 's slopes			1
the volatile volcano is also the main source of income for the island due to a combination of agriculture - stemming from its rich volcanic soil - and tourism .			0

@entity2 's latest eruption was caught on camera from @entity8 , near @entity9 , in @entity5
it spewed molten lava into the air and sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the @entity14 island
almost *1million* years old , the volcano is currently standing at 10,925 feet tall and still growing
