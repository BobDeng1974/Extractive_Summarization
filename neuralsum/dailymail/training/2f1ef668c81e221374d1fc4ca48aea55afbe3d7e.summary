a @entity1 cleric who once headed @entity3 's religious police has received death threats after his wife appeared with him on tv wearing make - up without a veil			1
@entity9 and his wife told the audience of a chat show that @entity13 does not require women to hide their faces behind a niqab in public			1
however his ' radical ' views have created a storm of controversy after his smiling wife , @entity21 , was seen uncovered , even wearing nail varnish			2
' happy now ? every mobile phone now has a picture of your wife , you pimp , ' one outraged post on @entity36 read			0
on the show , @entity37 told viewers : ' @entity40 did not order women to cover their faces			1
wearing make - up is allowed			1
' ' no one is saying that it is not allowed for a woman to cover her face , but i am saying that it is not obligatory and i have evidence in jurisprudence of this			0
' it 's a shocking u-turn for the former head of the religious police who was responsible for policing the dress code and behaviour of @entity1 citizens to ensure that they met strict religious requirements			2
the ' police ' work on behalf of @entity62 and make sure that people do not go against strict @entity13 rule			1
they patrol the streets checking dress code and strict separation of men and women			0
confusion ? @entity37 suggested that @entity71 became confused about ancient texts that mentioned the head scarf and the robe that women were commanded to wear @entity62 : the @entity62 employs a religious police to enforce behaviour that goes against strict @entity13 rule the host of the tv show , @entity78 , also appeared with her face uncovered in a move praised by liberals			1
at the time of writing , the interview had racked up over a million views on @entity86 since it aired over the weekend			0
but @entity37 told local paper , @entity87 , that he had received several death threats with one radical cleric allegedly calling for him to be ' tortured			1
' @entity1 's most senior cleric , the @entity91 , @entity90 joined the chorus of condemnation against him and urged him to ' ask repentance from @entity96 , and back away from this mistake			2
' @entity98 told news website @entity100 : ' my message to @entity103 is to fear @entity96			0
' meanwhile , a group of @entity1 from @entity105 said they will take legal action over the stunt			0
yet , despite receiving widespread criticism , @entity37 believes that there has been confusion over the veil			2
he suggested that @entity71 became confused about ancient texts that mentioned the head scarf and the robe that women were commanded to wear			0
he said : ' later , people confused the hijab , which was imposed only on the wives of the @entity119 , with what @entity120 imposed on @entity71 women in general			0
' @entity1 laws do not require women to wear the niqab , but women who appear in public with uncovered faces may face harassment from religious police			1
@entity37 previously faced a backlash for suggesting that women should be able to go out in public without a male guardian and mingle with the opposite sex in appropriate environments			2
these are all violations of customs in @entity1 .			0
