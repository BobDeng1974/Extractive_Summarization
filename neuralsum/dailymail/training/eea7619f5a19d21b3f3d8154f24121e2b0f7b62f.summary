@entity0 came into the @entity1 , otherwise known as the @entity2 , with all guns blazing			1
by so doing he resurrected himself from the @entity4 of boxing into a genuine world title contender , once again			0
the dazzling exhibition of high - class and deeply hurtful fisticuffs with which he reduced @entity11 ’s @entity10 to pulp inside eight rounds establishes this talented but hitherto wayward @entity14 as the mandatory challenger to @entity17 lightweight champion @entity16			1
@entity0 put @entity10 through eight rounds of hell on saturday night as he proved far more powerful @entity0 put on a masterclass in the capital as @entity10 took all sorts of punishment up to and including the eighth and final round @entity0 had an easy saturday night 's work against @entity10 as he won with an eighth - round stoppage @entity0 celebrates his victory over @entity11 's @entity10 after their the @entity29 lightweight title fight at @entity2 so easy a saturday night ’s work was this for the 30 - year - old @entity0 that it was evident the hard work had gone into the preparation for this fight for the @entity17 silver belt			1
@entity0 has admitted that he squandered his two previous world title challenges – against @entity38 and @entity39 – on booze and junk food			1
given this third opportunity to reach for the stars , he cleaned up his act , thanked his new girlfriend for helping him stay on the straight and narrow and has now proved that he is living the @entity47 life of a top ring professional			0
just in time , it really does seem all that talent is no to be ultimately wasted			0
there is talk of @entity16 being allowed a voluntary defence in april			2
but the defining day of @entity0 ’s career should come this summer			2
the cavernous @entity2 was reasonably well populated for a non-world title night and @entity0 came in to roaring @entity57 support			1
@entity10 was accompanied to the ring by his better known countryman @entity59 but the @entity11 legend , in attendance more for moral and inspirational support rather than active involvement took a seat a couple of rows back from the corner			2
@entity0 was much the more aggressive from the first bell and despite his opponent ’s extra height and long reach he connected on a surprisingly hesitant @entity11 with quick sharp lefts to head and body			0
the @entity74 was reasonably well populated for a non-world title night as @entity0 ( right ) punished @entity10 @entity0 was much the more aggressive from the first bell at the @entity2 in @entity57 as he breezed beyond @entity10 having sworn that he is now dedicated to boxing , @entity0 was not only keener but quicker			1
although @entity10 did begin to find the range with his range left jab , he walked onto the crisp right hand which put him down early in the second			1
@entity0 poured on the punishment in the third			0
yet despite taking a whole variety of spiteful blows the ponderous @entity11 somehow staggered and reeled through to the bell – and through more rounds of pure hell			0
that gave @entity0 the chance to impress with lightning combinations coupled with clever innovation as he weaved into close quarters			0
by the midway point at the end of the sixth round @entity10 was already in need of knock - out			2
but @entity0 was the only man looking likely to end the evening inside the 02 ’s requested curfew of an 11.30 pm finish			0
so slow was @entity10 that he rarely landed a punch			2
the end looked nigh as @entity0 landed at will in the seventh but again the bell prolonged the beating			0
but only for another minute and 12 seconds			0
@entity107 - @entity106 could have stopped it considerably sooner , should have called a halt as @entity0 came out bombing at the start of the eights , finally came to the gallant @entity10 ’s rescue as another onslaught climaxed in a left hook which left him tottering and defenceless			1
@entity10 barely landed a punch as he lost against a determined - looking @entity117 on saturday night @entity0 ( right ) beat @entity10 for the @entity29 lightweight title at the @entity2 in @entity57 on saturday night			1

@entity0 put on a masterclass at the @entity2 in @entity57 as he punished @entity10
@entity10 could barely get a punch in on @entity0 up to and including the eighth and final round
the *referee* stopped it in the eighth as @entity0 sealed the @entity29 lightweight title
@entity0 becomes the mandatory challenger to @entity17 lightweight champion @entity16
