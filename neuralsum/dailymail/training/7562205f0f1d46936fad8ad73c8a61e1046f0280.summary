the @entity10 today began a letter writing campaign against the $ 75 product , calling it ' oppressive and destructive to young children , ' while also naming it the worst toy of the year			0

' @entity2 should stay true to its mission to foster learning and development by creating products for infants that promote , rather than undermine , interaction with caregivers , ' ms @entity55 said			1
how it works : the @entity64 is a bouncy seat for infants with a place for an @entity8 directly above the baby ¿ s face			0
critics say it blocks his or her view of the rest of the world there is an equal amount of outrage aimed at a similar product aimed at potty - training toddlers which mounts an @entity8 in infront of a child who is learning to use the toilet			1
both efforts ask for the products to be recalled under the guise that they could harm developmental learning of body cues , and socialization			0
@entity91 , a doctor and professor of pediatrics at the @entity94 said attaching @entity8 to babies ’ seats is ' a terrible idea			0
' ' does anyone out there think that kids need more screen time ? ” @entity91 asked			1
“ there is no need to hurry to expose kids to new technology , certainly not babies — or newborns ! ' a doctor who spoke to @entity109 is weary about how it might affect babies			0
‘ i think parents need to be really careful here , ’ said dr. @entity111			0

virtual babysitter : more than half of @entity125 parents have admitted that they use tech gadgets to entertain their children when they are busy other options : the arm can be removed to ' disable ' the @entity8 - holding feature ‘ the best thing for a child is extensive interaction with people , hearing voices , seeing faces , physically touching toys , ’ he said			1
‘ i worry that screens will replace these important human interactions			0
’ @entity2 describes the seat on its web site as ' a grow - with - me seat for baby that ’s soothing , entertaining , and has a touch of technology , too			1
' @entity147 is already under pressure by the @entity10 and other advocacy groups that have complained to the @entity150 that @entity2 ’s mobile apptivity suite of apps deceives consumers with promised educational benefits despite little research having been done to prove that online sites can help babies ’ brain development			2
parent company @entity147 has kept quiet on the matter so far			0

@entity2 ’s seat had more than 100 reviews , the majority negative			2
one customer wrote : ' i am disgusted with @entity2 and urge @entity166 to reconsider carrying this terrible contraption ! ! @entity173 of all children need to be able to move and putting them on the floor ( on rugs or mats ) is the best way they can freely move and explore their world			2
secondly , the @entity181 recommends no screen time for babies under 2			1
babies need to move to understand and explore their world and they need to manipulate things , not passively watch them ! it has no redeeming features , it is actually detrimental to children 's growth and development ! ! for shame @entity2 - you have stooped to new lows ( and there are lots of them )			2
' other reviewers wrote similar scathing remarks : ' this has to be one of the worst ideas for a baby product that i have ever seen			0
babies under six months of age should never be strapped in and forced to stare at a screen pulsing images in front of them			0
not only is it horrible for vision and brain development , but it encourages irresponsible parenting as well			0
the @entity216 recommends zero screen time for children under the age of two			1
' bathroom reading : there have also been complaints about this potty - training device that comes complete with room for an @entity8 as companies rush to integrate technology into toys , baby gear and classrooms , doctors and child advocates say children today are immersed more than ever in a world of screens and thatt constant access to games , television and the @entity239 may be taking away from family time , exercise and discovery in the physical world , critics say			1
it 's not the first time @entity2 has been in the hot seat for a high - tech baby toy			1
last year the company picked up the same worst toy award from the group for a stuffed monkey toy that mounted an @entity252 in the belly area , and ran special @entity2 apps .			2

campaign for @entity257 say @entity2 should ' stay true to its mission ' to promote interaction
child *psychologists* recommend no screen time at all until a child is two
there is no *conclusive* evidence on how electronic device usage affects toddlers over the long - term
