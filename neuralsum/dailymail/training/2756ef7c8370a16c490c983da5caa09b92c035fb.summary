@entity0 may be playing in his seventh @entity1 but he insists the desire to beat @entity3 ' as hard as you can ' remains undimmed			1
previous teams have always had a significant @entity7 influence , with the likes of @entity9 and @entity10 and @entity0 , who took on that mantle over the last decade or so			1
however , after the heroics of @entity16 in 2012 and the presence of world number one @entity12 also in the @entity14 ranks , @entity0 is not now really thought of as the go - to guy when it comes to geeing up the team			1
@entity0 laughs during a press conference ahead of the @entity23 @entity0 has been practising with @entity24 this week at @entity25 , in the lead - up to friday but there is no doubt the fire still burns bright within the 34 - year - old			1
' this is not a competition			2
i think we all know what we bring to the team , ' he said			2
' at the end of the day , the most important thing is that we are all here together and we are all here fighting for each other			2
' everybody has their own way of doing it and we love the way @entity48 does it , and we all try to do it the way we know that works better for us and for the team			2
' the drive to try to do well and obviously win , it 's still the same			0
' there 's no doubt @entity14 now are a lot more global than we used to be and a lot more of us play on the @entity58 and get to play with a lot of the @entity3			1
' we get to know each other better and obviously have closer relationships , but once you put your clothes on and your shoes on and you step on the first tee you still want to beat them as hard as you can , the same way that they do with us			0
' that 's the nature of the game			0
' @entity0 seemed in good spirits on wednesday as he addressed the media spectators watch on as @entity0 drives from the 10th tee during a practice round on wednesday @entity0 practised with @entity12 on tuesday and it is entirely possible the two will be paired together on friday morning 's fourballs			1
the world number one and current holder of two of this year 's four majors is , as he was two years ago , @entity24 's form player			2
' he 's definitely grown up a lot , i think both as a player and as a person , ' said @entity0			1
' he 's gotten to know what the @entity1 is all about even better			1
he has a lot more respect for it - not that he did n't before			2
' he lives it a little bit more than maybe he would have at the beginning , so i think he 's become a really nice team player			0
@entity95 ( left ) played with @entity12 on tuesday ( right ) and the pair could be together on friday @entity16 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) during their practice round on wednesday at @entity25 ' obviously we know the ability he has to play and it 's been nice to be a part of it with him on the team			1
' i 've got to know him quite a lot and he 's the kind of guy that you always want to have on your team			0
' but to me , truly , i can see so many pairings			0
i can see everybody playing with everybody			0
' it 's not like sometimes you get on teams and you think , okay , so these are pairings that are definitely going to be there			0
' here i could see myself playing with everybody on the team , no problem , and the same way around			0
' it does n't matter if it 's a rookie or a veteran			0
i see a lot of depth on this team			0
' @entity24 's photo - call on tuesday attracted a large media presence			1
