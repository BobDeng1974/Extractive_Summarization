by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 08:24 est , 23 march 2012 a debate is raging in @entity2 over whether the national football squad should pay its respect at the site of the @entity7 death camp of @entity8 when the team plays in the @entity10 in @entity11 this summer			1
@entity8 , built by the @entity12 near @entity13 during the @entity14 , was the extermination camp which murdered 1.2 million of the six million victims of the @entity16			2
now a museum and place of remembrance , thousands of @entity2 schoolchildren are among the hundreds of thousands who visit it annually			0
difficult decision : a debate is raging in @entity2 over whether the national soccer squad should pay its respect at the site of the @entity7 death camp of @entity8 when the team plays in the @entity10 in @entity11 this summer the @entity28 squad has already said it will make a pilgrimage to the site to pay respects to the dead			1
but for @entity2 , it is a more tortured and complex issue			0
@entity35 @entity34 is among those who does believe they should attend because ' players are ' models for so many young people ' @entity41 , president of the @entity42 whose grandparents were gassed there , is among those who says the team should visit the site , arguing ; ' it would send a disastrous message to the rest of the world if the @entity2 players were to bypass @entity8			1
' the young players do n't bear the blame , but they do bear the responsibility			1
' @entity55 and catholic church leaders also say they should go but it is understood that the @entity2 @entity58 is not keen on the idea , that it would not only draw attention away from the football but might also put an intolerable emotional strain on individuals			0
@entity64 , a prominent @entity2 - @entity65 writer , is also opposed to the gesture			0
in an article in the news magazine @entity68 he said ; ' what are the footballers supposed to do in @entity8 ? swear that they 're sorry ? explain that this sort of thing can " never happen again ? " and has anyone thought about what would happen if the @entity2 players visited @entity8 and became so overcome by emotion that they lost the tournament ? ' it is n't about the players visiting @entity8			1
it 's about the images of the visit that will be broadcast to the rest of the world afterwards - as if they were touring an @entity86 in @entity87 to draw the world 's attention to the misery of war orphans			0
' the @entity2 footballers have no business going to @entity8			0
that is , unless some of them choose to go there on their own and without the cameras , for personal reasons that would make them accountable to no one			2
' if the @entity102 wanted to take @entity41 's advice and " send a message " , it could come up with something more original than an obligatory visit to a place where wreaths are deposited , and where visitors can show their retroactive consternation for free			0
' showing solidarity for dead @entity65 is a cheap exercise			2
the people who were murdered ca n't be killed again , nor can they be rescued retroactively			0
' but in case someone does feel something resembling ' responsibility ' - and there 's nothing wrong with that , in principle - then he would be better off declaring his solidarity with those who are alive today , and would like to stay that way			0
' ' cheap exercise ' : there are some who say the @entity2 players , pictured at the @entity129 in 2010 , should not visit @entity8 @entity2 newspapers are filled with those who argue that it is a duty of the footballers to pay their respects there and others , like @entity64 , who say there is no need for them to go			1
but former team captain @entity34 is among those who does believe they should attend because ' players such as @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 or @entity147 are the idols of today , the role models for so many young people '			1
' if they attend a simple ceremony at @entity8 and are moved by it , then much can be achieved , ' he added			1
it is understood the government would like the team to make a gesture at the camp as @entity158 rises in @entity2 , particularly among the young , and internet propaganda denying that the genocide of the @entity65 ever took place continues to proliferate .			2

the @entity28 squad has already said it will make a pilgrimage to the site to pay respects to the dead
former captain @entity34 says players should attend because ' much can be achieved '
