@entity0 went from one extreme to the other , their near perfect display in the first one - day international being replaced by a shambolic one as they were blown away by @entity3 in conditions that seemed made for them			1
it was cold and cloudy at @entity7 but @entity3 looked completely at home as they inflicted on @entity0 their heaviest defeat in a one - day international they have staged — 157 runs — by blasting them out for just 99			1
this was a golden opportunity for @entity0 to take a 2 - 0 lead in their first series under new management , particularly after they had won the toss , but @entity3 made them look just like the novices they so often seemed in @entity22			1
@entity3 's @entity23 ( centre ) celebrates the crucial wicket of @entity26 @entity27 was bowled for a duck as @entity0 's top order were blown away @entity30 smashes the ball for six on his way to a quick - fire 40 @entity3 's @entity33 celebrates the big wicket of @entity35 @entity0 ’s problems in one - day cricket usually crop up overseas when the sun shines and the pitch is flat but here they were outplayed and out - classed by a @entity3 team who effectively beat them at their own 50 - over game			1
@entity3 showed @entity0 how it should be done in what should have been a testing environment in may at the most northerly @entity47 ground in the world , keeping wickets in hand before building a respectable total			1
then , when @entity0 set off for what should have been a gettable chase , their top order had no answer to the seam of @entity33 , who gained more movement off the pitch than a home attack led by @entity60			2
admittedly @entity0 were without @entity61 , who was ruled out with a groin injury			0
he could have been expected to have shown much more solidity against the moving ball than yesterday ’s sorry bunch			0
yet @entity61 ’s absence was no excuse for @entity0 , who were shoddy in the field , bowling 15 wides and dropping two catches , and even worse with the bat , with only stand - in captain @entity73 going down fighting			1
‘ that was one of the worst performances i ’ve ever been involved in , ’ said @entity73			0
‘ it was abysmal , really , and i just ca n’t explain why we played that badly			0
we ’ve played a lot of cricket here and that was a pitch which should have suited us			0
we just did n’t play at all and we will have to draw a line under this and up our game in @entity85			0
’ @entity0 had won their previous four odis before yesterday , but their problems began quickly when they were unable to make significant inroads with the two new balls			2
the vastly experienced @entity3 top order had more than enough nous to repel an @entity0 attack which seemed , in the absence of @entity94 and @entity95 , to be a bowler short , with @entity26 more a fifth seamer than fourth			2
@entity98 has made his name as an innovative destroyer but he showed here that he can apply himself too , providing the backbone of the @entity3 innings with 88 before being bowled by a beauty from @entity105			1
but that delivery was a rarity and , even though there was no swing for their bowlers , they could not seem to avoid bowling wides , @entity105 and @entity114 being the worst offenders with five apiece			0
@entity114 was flattered by his three wickets and was guilty , along with @entity26 , of a bad drop as @entity3 gained late momentum through @entity119 and added 87 in their last 10 overs			2
‘ we never drop catches in practice so this is becoming a huge annoyance , ’ added @entity73			0
@entity0 's injured captain @entity61 takes a close - up looks at the action @entity61 watched on as @entity0 's batting line - up played dismally not a pretty sight : @entity61 looks most unimpressed with what is happening out in the middle @entity61 could n't watch any more as @entity0 collapased to 99 all out @entity23 wheels away after taking the early wicket of @entity105 a score of 256 for eight should have been within @entity0 ’s reach but they ended up falling an incredible 157 runs short and barely lasted more than halfway through their allotted overs as they crumbled before a disappointing @entity141 crowd of 10,570			1
only @entity73 and @entity35 reached double figures and after @entity33 had knocked the early stuffing out of @entity0 , the unorthodox spin of @entity23 proved far too much for the lower order with four cheap wickets			1
this was the sixth worst one - day international total of all time for @entity0 , while their paltry innings accrued only 13 more runs than their worst ever , 86 against @entity22 at @entity152 in 2001			2
@entity153 dives over the crease to survive a run - out attempt it is to @entity85 they go now for wednesday ’s third match with the series level , and @entity0 will hope that @entity61 will be fit to regain his place ahead of @entity160 , who blew his chance here to prove he can bat at this level as well as he can moan about perceived injustices in @entity22			1
@entity94 , meanwhile , made his comeback for @entity166 after knee problems but is the subject of a complaint from @entity170 over comments of his own he made on @entity172 about the bowling action of another mystery spinner in @entity175			0
the man who was badly missed by @entity0 here at @entity141 appeared to question the legality of @entity175 ’s action , prompting @entity170 to ask for an explanation from @entity0			2
they will have to explain themselves for this sorry performance first			0
@entity105 jumps for joy after taking the wicket of @entity98			0

@entity3 won by 157 runs to draw level at 1 - 1 in the five - match @entity187
@entity98 named man of the match after scoring a *brilliant* 88 from 101 balls
@entity23 took four wickets to blow away the @entity0 tail
@entity73 described @entity0 's defeat as ' abysmal '
