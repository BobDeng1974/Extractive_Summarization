planning the perfect road trip is n't just about creating the ultimate playlist and getting a map - what you really need are algorithms			1
now the man behind the ' where 's @entity9 ' algorithm has created a road trip route revealing the best way to visit 48 @entity13 states			1
using a series of equation , the @entity15 data scientist says his method can also be used on shorter journeys , beating google maps on providing the best route possible			2
zoom in on this interactive map to find the best road trip route across the @entity13 @entity24 came up with the map when @entity26 challenged him to plot the best route across continental @entity13			1
his only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous @entity13 states , along with @entity30 and two stops in @entity32			2
each stop would be at a national natural landmark , national historic site , national park or national monument			0
and the car could never leave @entity13 soil			0
to create the map , mr @entity24 first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided			1
the tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible			0

the resulting 13,699 - mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself rather than looking at every possible solution , @entity24 used something known as a ' genetic algorithms ' which starts with just a few random solutions			1
it then manipulates these solutions , while trying something slightly different each time , until it finds one that it ca n't improve on			0
the resulting 13,699 - mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself			1
in his blog , mr @entity72 explains how he used information from @entity75 and wrote code to discover the optimum distance to drive to all 50 landmarks			2
this was the same code he had previously created to discover @entity9 – or @entity81 in the @entity82			0
' with 50 landmarks to put in order , we would have to exhaustively evaluate 3 x 1064 possible routes to find the shortest one , ' he wrote			0
' if you started computing this problem on your home computer right now , you 'd find the optimal route in about 9.64 x 1052 years — long after the sun has entered its red giant phase and devoured the @entity93			0
' this complication is why @entity96 's route optimisation service only optimises routes of up 10 waypoints			0

the data scientist has also created another road trip map that makes stops at the top - ranked @entity111 map is 12,290 miles long and is similar to the original but skips over @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 the resulting 13,699 - mile route would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving if you had the road to yourself			1
mr @entity24 , however , advises putting aside two to three months to complete the trip			2
' you 'll hit every major area in the @entity13 on this trip , and as an added bonus , you wo n't spend too long driving through the endless cornfields of @entity126 , ' he wrote on his blog			2
the data scientist has also created another road trip map that makes stops at the top - ranked @entity111 cities			1
this map is 12,290 miles long and is similar to the original but skips over @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
' this is especially interesting because @entity111 reviewers recommend cities like @entity136 , @entity15 — the seventh most crime - ridden city in the @entity13 — over any city in @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			2
i 'll leave the interpretation of that fact to the reader , ' @entity140 wrote			0
@entity140 also created an ideal @entity51 road trip and he 's released the code so that anyone can create their own route			1
the @entity51 trip covers 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving , and mr @entity24 advises putting three months aside to explore the cities .			1

@entity15 data scientist , @entity24 , came up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance
the 13,699 - mile route travels through 48 states and would take 9.33 days of non-stop driving on clear roads
mr @entity24 also created a 12,290 - mile road trip map that makes stops at the top - ranked @entity111 cities in @entity13
he has created a @entity51 road trip and released code used to create it so that any can create a *custom* route
