by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 21 february 2013 testing : police officers will be forced to take strict fitness tests as an official report reveals that three - quarters of @entity6 officers are overweight or obese police officers are to be forced to take new fitness tests – and will have their pay slashed if they fail			1
ministers are also planning to cut the wages of officers who take desk jobs because they claim their health is too poor for frontline duties			2
the move comes as @entity17 reveals the scale of the ‘ sicknote culture ’ in the police			0
our investigation shows that more than 5,300 officers in @entity24 and @entity25 have been placed on restricted backroom duties – usually on full pay – because they are deemed to be incapable of normal operational roles because of conditions such as ‘ malaise ’ or ‘ fatigue ’			1
but any crackdown on fitness is likely to lead to a fresh showdown between the government and police			0
ministers are already at loggerheads with officers over pay and conditions , and the ‘ plebgate ’ row between cabinet minister @entity43 and @entity45 police			0
however , the reforms , spearheaded by police minister @entity47 , aim to tackle fears that the public are being endangered by a ‘ fat blue line ’ too unfit to chase crooks			0
the @entity17 investigation found that in one force alone , a startling 500 specialist officers working in roles such as firearms and dog handling failed a fitness test			1
the shake - up has been inspired by chief inspector of constabulary @entity61 ’s report into pay and conditions in the police			2
he recommended that the current fitness test , taken only by specialist officers , should be made more stringent			1
in place of the current ‘ shuttle run ’ in which officers sprint back and forth between lines 15 metres apart , mr @entity47 is likely to introduce an ‘ assault course ’ with crawling , jumping , balancing on a beam , climbing over a wall and dragging a weight			0
anyone who fails the test three times will face ‘ unsatisfactory performance ’ procedures , which could lead to a pay cut			0
mr @entity47 is also determined to reduce the number of officers given back - office jobs after suffering injury or ill - health			2
police placed on these duties for more than a year face losing eight per cent of their salary – and after two years could be forced to take ill - health retirement			2
last night , mr @entity47 said the fitness tests would be introduced soon			1
and the @entity96 confirmed : ‘ compulsory annual fitness testing for all officers has been agreed and a working group is planning its implementation			2
proposals on restricted duties are still under discussion			2
’ this newspaper asked all 39 @entity24 police forces to detail how many officers had been placed on restricted duties and why			1
the results revealed stark variations : while a shocking eight per cent of police on @entity110 and in @entity111 are on restricted duties , in @entity113 the figure is just one per cent			0
out of the 21 forces that responded , 2,373 officers were on restricted duties , just over four per cent			1
among all 134,101 officers in @entity24 and @entity25 , this would equate to more than 5,300 on such duties			1
all but a handful are on full pay			0
the 350 on @entity110 doing back - room work include a chief superintendent , a superintendent and two chief inspectors			0
a spokesman said : ‘ these procedures allow officers to return to work in a meaningful role			0
’ in @entity130 , the 137 police on restricted duties – three per cent of the force – include six with ‘ malaise or fatigue ’ and 85 with ‘ musculo - skeletal ’ problems			1
according to our figures , 508 out of the 10,156 specialist @entity137 officers who took a fitness test in the past two years failed			1
a @entity143 spokeswoman said that was just five per cent and added : ‘ the individual is immediately taken off operational duties and given an action plan to increase their fitness			0
’ in @entity110 , 91 officers out of 2,685 failed the fitness tests			1
the highest fail rate was in @entity153 , with 6.5 per cent .			0
