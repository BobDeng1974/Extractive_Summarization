as television ’s mild - mannered horticulturalist turned daytime chat - show host , @entity0 rarely courts controversy			1
but when he invited ‘ dog whisperer ’ @entity6 to appear as a guest it was never going to please everyone			1
@entity10 - based @entity6 ’s unconventional training methods to ‘ rehabilitate ’ ill - disciplined dogs , including physically attacking them , using electric shocks and spikes on collars , have split public opinion worldwide and led many to brand him ‘ barbaric ’			1
more than 1,000 people joined a @entity29 campaign demanding @entity6 ’s appearance be cancelled			1
production staff were inundated with calls and @entity0 was bombarded with hundreds of emails , while a @entity35 page set up by protesters attracted 1,600 followers			2
and when animal welfare campaigners threatened to disrupt the live show , extra security staff were drafted in			0
@entity0 , left , gave his guest , dog whisperer @entity6 , right , a tough grilling on his show although @entity0 , 63 , refused to cancel the interview , he took on his guest in an uncharacteristically confrontational style			1
‏ @ @entity48 : @entity0 clearly has no idea what he 's talking about			1
@entity6 has so much respect and affection for dogs			1
‏ @ @entity54 : shocked to see how @entity0 treated @ cesarmillan on his tv show			2
@entity6 is nothing but professional and works well with dogs			2
‏ @ floatygoat : @entity0 interviewing @entity6 was so frustrating			1
less of an interview , more of a series of stupid accusations			0
‏ @ kjvjude113 : @entity0 was a complete a * * * ‏ @ @entity63 : very frustrating , the guys has clearly never watched dog whisperer ...			2
i wana punch titchmarsh now			0
# mynanwillhateme @ @entity67 : appalling treatment by @entity0 on @ @entity26 of @ cesarmillan			2
where is your evidence ? i have seen nothing but good from @entity6			0
@entity0 told @entity6 : ‘ you punish dogs , you hit them			1
i ’ve seen you punch a dog in the throat to get it to behave and to most people , like myself , i would say that is totally unacceptable as a way of training a dog			1
’ an unsettled @entity6 replied : ‘ well obviously i would respectfully disagree with that			0
it ’s not a punch , it ’s a touch			0
’ @entity0 countered : ‘ i watched the video of it and if somebody touched me like that i would be hurt			0
you went for the throat and you punched the dog back and the dog bit you and held on to your hand			0
‘ having watched a lot of boxing matches it looked like something @entity97 would deliver			0
’ @entity6 again insisted that it was nothing more than a touch			0
‘ but you also work with electric shocks and collars and spikes on collars that really hurt them , ’ continued @entity0			0
‘ you know , this is pretty barbaric treatment			0
what ’s your reasoning for treating dogs like this ? ’ @entity6 insisted that his methods were simply used to ‘ snap the ( dog ’s ) brain out of it ’			1
after the interview opinion on @entity29 and other social media was divided , with some backing @entity0 , while others rounded on him for being ‘ abusive ’			1
in a statement read out on air , the @entity120 said : ‘ adverse training techniques which have been seen to be used by @entity6 can cause pain and fear for dogs and may worsen their behavioural problems			2
‘ the @entity120 believes that using such techniques is unacceptable , nor are they necessary to change dog behaviour for the better when other dog trainers use reward - based methods to train dogs very effectively			2
’ controversy : @entity131 - born @entity6 with one of the animals he has trained			0

@entity0 grilled his guest @entity6 on the ' totally unacceptable ' way that he trains dogs
*members* of the public had earlier called for the show to be cancelled because of @entity6 's ' barbaric ' methods
but after the show opinion was split over whether @entity0 was too ' abusive ' to his guest
