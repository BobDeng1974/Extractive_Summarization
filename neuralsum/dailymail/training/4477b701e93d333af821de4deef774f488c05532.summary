by @entity0 published : 14:42 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 20:36 est , 17 february 2013 train company bosses are enjoying huge salaries at a time when six out of ten passengers are dissatisfied with their train company , damning new figures reveal today			1
more than half of train firms received a customer satisfaction rating of 50per cent or less in the latest survey			2
yet at the state - run @entity13 line , where services are being run directly by the government , there are eight directors on salaries of more than £ 100,000 a year			1
@entity13 is paid for by the taxpayer and has as many as eight directors on salaries above £ 100,000 the @entity13 information supplied showed that one director - almost certainly managing director @entity23 - was on a salary of between £ 161,000 and £ 180,000			1
two directors ’ salaries came within the £ 121,000 to £ 140,000 band , and five other directors were on between £ 100,000 and £ 120,000 a year			1
meanwhile , none of the 18 other train operating companies were prepared to reveal how many of their directors were on six - figure salaries - even though the railway industry receives around £ 5billion a year from the taxpayer			1
@entity37 's chief executive sir @entity36 was on an annual basic salary of £ 560,000 as of march 31 last year critics accused them ‘ hiding behind a veil of secrecy as they bleed passengers dry ’			1
train companies became the subject of fury earlier when passengers were hit by above - inflation fare rises - despite the poor punctuality and ‘ cattle class ’ travel conditions faced by many commuters			1
the latest research by which ? shows that only 1 in 5 ( 22per cent ) of train travellers feel their service is improving , despite the fare rises			2
@entity59 , which suffered severe disruption last week , was bottom in the satisfaction league table of 19 rail companies with only 40per cent of passengers satisfied with its service			2
passengers said the service ’s commuter trains were consistently overcrowded and poor value for money			0
@entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 railways all fared poorly , with fewer than 45 per cent of passengers satisfied			0
the results were compiled by which ? from responses from 7,500 regular train users			2
citing some of the feedback it received , which ? said : ‘ one @entity59 customer told us : ‘ the price has increased and the trains get more and more crowded			0
i never see any improvements for the extra money i am paying ’			0
‘ and a @entity89 passenger said : ‘ the prices are terrible , the service is bad and trains are often delayed , cancelled and dirty			0
the survey also showed that 40per cent of train travellers are likely to cut the number of journeys following the recent inflation - busting price increases which have seen season tickets rise by an average of 4.2per cent but some fares soaring 10 per cent			1
but a third of commuters said they did not have an alternative way of getting to work and ‘ will just have to pay more ’ , says the report			0
overall , the report concluded , only 22 per cent of train users felt that things were ‘ on the up			2
’ a spokesman for @entity59 rejected the findings - suggesting that some of the customers must have had an ‘ axe to grind			0
’ ‘ this is questionable research which quizzed just 461 people online out of the 170,000 we carry every day , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ people chose to take part so many who did would have had an axe to grind			0
@entity124 , general secretary of @entity125 , said private rail companies were ' scandalous ' for not disclosing salaries ‘ a face - to - face survey by rail watchdog @entity129 which is audited by the @entity131 that shows 81 % of our passengers are satisfied or very satisfied with our service and 13 % are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied			1
’ but last month ’s @entity129 study also showed fewer than half @entity137 ’s train travellers think the railways are giving value for money - dropping to under a third for the worst performing operators			1
pay levels for executives on the tax - payer backed @entity13 were obtained following a request under the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) @entity145			1
all other train companies insisted that they were not obliged to reply as the @entity148 did not apply to them as they were private companies			1
only one company , @entity151 , was prepared to offer any pay - level details on a @entity154 request basis			0
information from @entity151 covered the year 2011			0
it showed the highest paid director - almost certainly managing director @entity158 - was on £ 222,000 including pension contributions			1
bosses at rail infrastructure company @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , which is currently striving to meet punctuality targets on long - haul routes , are also enjoying fat cat salaries and packages with the lure of lucrative bonuses on top			2
in the last few days rail passengers have endured some miserable travelling conditions , with an overhead power line problem in @entity172 leading to severe delays on busy commuter routes			0
@entity37 ’s chief executive sir @entity36 was on an annual basic salary of £ 560,000 as of march 31 2012 , while finance director @entity177 was on £ 382,000			0
network operations chief @entity178 was on £ 360,000 , as was infrastructure director @entity179			0
in addition to their salaries , the @entity37 chiefs stand to be paid performance - related bonuses running into hundreds of thousands of pounds .			2

state - run @entity13 line has up to eight directors on £ 100,000 salaries
private train companies accused of hiding salaries ' behind a veil of secrecy '
