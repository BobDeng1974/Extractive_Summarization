have you ever daydreamed about having superhuman strength so you can lift weights with such ease it was like picking up a feather ? well , now one man has man this dream a reality			2
incredible suits capable of lifting heavy weights have been developed by universities and the military , but until now the technology was prohibitively expensive			1
now a @entity16 engineer has made his own exoskeleton using scraps of metal to make his dream of having superhero powers a reality			2
his contraption looks like a mechanical backpack with metal arms , which are strapped securely to his own			0
pneumatic cylinders on the arms allow him to lift heavy weights with ease and he can be seen curling the large weights in the video			1
the exoskeleton comprises two arms , a backpack frame , valve bank and a compressor			0
pneumatic cylinders on the arms allow mr @entity26 to lift heavy weights with ease			1
when the valve is activated , high pressure is pumped into the top section of the back cylinders and the bottom section of the front cylinders on the backpack			0
that pushes one piston down and the other one up			0
when this happens , the lifting arm pivots and when the back piston depressed , the arms lift up			1
‘ i did n’t feel like i was lifting 170lbs … but my legs felt it , ’ he said			2
mr @entity26 has documented the creation of the exoskeleton , which he has been working on since may			0
talking about his motivation to create the gadget on his website , he said : ' as you can probably imagine , it 's been a life goal of mine to build some kind of exoskeleton - the alien exoskeleton , an @entity77 suit ... the list goes on			2
‘ [ but ] it 's just too darn expensive ! until now			0
a friend got me a bunch of pneumatic cylinders and it 's finally within my reach			2
’ while he has not said how much the exoskeleton has cost to make , it features two arms , a backpack frame , valve bank and a compressor			0
his friend and fellow @entity92 star , @entity93 , explained that when the valve is activated , high pressure is pumped into the top section of the back cylinders and the bottom section of the front cylinders on the backpack			0
lots of people daydream about having superhuman strength – or an @entity77 suit ( pictured ) they could use to save the world			0
incredible suits capable of lifting heavy weights have been developed by universities and the military but the technology is prohibitively expensive for consumers @entity113 and ready for action : the contraction looks like a mechanical backpack with metal arms ( pictured ) , which are strapped securely to mr @entity26 's own			1
they allow him to lift heavy weights			1
with the addition of a better air compressor and support for his legs and back , the engineer could lift much heavier weights that pushes one piston down and the other one up			1
when this happens , the lifting arms pivot and when the back piston is depressed , the arms lift up			1
mr @entity26 can lift the 170lb ( 78kg ) weights unaided to waist level , but used the pneumatic exoskeleton to raise the weights higher			1
he thinks with a few tweaks , his exoskeleton could lift double the weight			1
‘ if i upgrade my air compressor , i could potentially curl 300lbs ( 136kg ) but i do n’t think my back and legs could take it , ' he said			0
‘ i ’m going to have to build the lower half of this exoskeleton – it ’s just going to get better from here			0

a @entity27 engineer known as @entity28 , has demonstrated his diy exoskeleton by lifting a 171.5lbs ( 78kg ) breeze block barbell
pneumatic cylinders on the arms allow him to lift heavy weights with ease
but he felt his legs and back aching - so is *planning* to extend the ' suit '
he thinks with a few tweaks , his exoskeleton could lift double the weight
