in the latest instalment of his weekly column , chief sports writer @entity0 gives his verdict on the sporting issues of the week , saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver ... what 's hot @entity8 talking to @entity9 , chief executive of @entity10 , on @entity13 ’s brother ’s yacht last weekend – just thought i ’d get that one in – he advanced the probability that @entity18 ’s run would be curtailed by injury at some stage this season			1
that @entity22 and @entity23 would miss the odd game , and this would slow them down			2
leaving aside the fact that @entity22 did not play between october 5 and november 1 , in which time @entity18 beat @entity30 2 - 1 , @entity31 6 - 0 , drew 1 - 1 at @entity32 and eliminated @entity33 from the @entity34 , there is another flaw in that argument			1
could n’t the same be said of @entity8 ? and without @entity8 , where would @entity10 be ? @entity8 was in scintillating form for @entity10 against @entity39 on tuesday night after his hat - trick against @entity39 , that is now 17 goals in all competitions for the @entity10 striker , a phenomenal return			1
to put that run into perspective , his nearest colleague has four			2
the rest of the team put together have 21			0
@entity22 is in outstanding form for @entity18 , too , but he has six fewer goals than @entity8 in four fewer appearances			1
@entity22 is averaging a goal every 0.78 games			0
@entity8 is up at 0.94			1
he is the one that needs the cotton wool wrap			0
@entity58 ( right ) and @entity23 celebrate a goal during @entity18 's 5 - 0 win over @entity61 @entity62 @entity63 was a @entity64 revolutionary and national hero from the 19th century			1
executed by the @entity68 in 1873 , his interest in football would have been negligible			0
he gave his name to a mean stadium , though			0
the pitch is rubbish , the bitter cold nobody ’s friend but , oh , those floodlights			0
@entity76 , intense , illuminating a monolithic , @entity78 - influenced concrete bowl with a running track for the other sports , the minute you saw them , you knew you could n’t be anywhere but @entity83			2
i can remember visiting the @entity85 , @entity86 , when @entity87 played in @entity88			0
@entity89 is a multi-sport club founded in the @entity78 ( this is why so many teams with that name have the same badge ) , meaning their influence goes far beyond football			0
in the entrance hall of @entity85 was a plaque commemorating all of the @entity86 athletes that had won gold medals at the @entity100			0
it was huge and all were celebrated equally , summer and winter			0
and there i found it , written in cyrillic script , but recognisable			0
@entity109 line up for their team photo before taking on @entity111 at the @entity63 stadium in @entity113 night games or night games : sex , @entity116 to give its full title			0
the winner of the @entity119 is the work of @entity121 , an @entity122 writer who uses the rape trial of an @entity124 as the starting point for an exploration of sport ’s dangerous casual misogyny			1
' treating women like s * * * shades into a culture of abuse , which in turn can shade into rape , ' @entity121 concludes			1
it should be essential reading at all football clubs in the @entity140 era			0
what 's not @entity142 why is it that whenever a @entity148 athlete does something exceptional , his success is viewed through the prism of @entity142 ? it ’s a public vote , a lame popularity contest , no different to x factor			1
it does not matter if @entity154 wins it or not ; what he did in @entity157 was exceptional			1
@entity154 proudly holds a @entity159 after he won the formula one world championship last weekend @entity162 @entity161 if you have devised a system that is so complex even you ca n’t work it out , maybe it is time for a change			1
@entity162 think that @entity10 are third in @entity168 they ’re not			1
the first method of differentiating between teams on the same points is to use their results , head to head			0
@entity177 , @entity178 and @entity10 all have five points			1
but @entity177 have a better head - to - head record against @entity181 , who are better head to head than @entity10			1
@entity10 and @entity177 have yet to play their second game			1
so why are @entity10 in third place ? according to @entity162 , alphabetical order			1
they do n’t use the head - to - head calculations until all games have been completed			2
so , from the top , it ’s r for @entity177 , @entity192 for @entity10 , c for @entity178			2
these people clearly did not watch @entity195			0
but , wait , there ’s more			0
@entity162 have their official team listings in @entity168 as @entity177 , @entity10 and @entity178			2
to be on the safe side in future , @entity10 may wish to change their name to @entity203			2
you know , like plumbers in the @entity206			0
@entity10 are bottom of their group but know a win in @entity210 is likely to send them through @entity211 , @entity212 @entity213 , head of recruitment , has decamped for @entity215 – a club that may be gearing up to spend two years in exile at @entity217 – while @entity218 is again talking about leaving at the end of the season			1
hello ? have you lot looked at a league table lately ? the next month is going to be tough , starting with sunday ’s game against @entity10 – but the biggest hindrance to @entity211 ’s advancement right now would appear to be the doubts of those inside the club			2
what happened to daring to dream ? @entity230			0

@entity8 *scored* a hat - trick as @entity10 beat @entity39
@entity234 by @entity121 winner of @entity119
@entity154 favourite to win @entity142
*confusion* over @entity241 group standings
