by @entity0 this is the terrifying moment a climber hung from a wall of ice inches away from a powerful waterfall			1
defying the elements , @entity6 hiked himself up 460 feet of icicles at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the stunning climb is believed to be the toughest mixed route in the world			0
perilous : will @entity6 , 47 , was hauling himself up a wall of icicles for eight hours in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , after three weeks of planning hanging next to a waterfall , mr @entity6 , a prolific climber from @entity19 , @entity11 , had to use all his strength to keep on track - but broke his index finger in the process after three weeks of planning , it took prolific climber @entity6 more than eight hours to complete			1
temperatures dropped to as low as -35c during the climb , which would be regarded as severe in @entity30			1
but the region is notorious for fluctuating conditions , and mr @entity6 , 47 , spent the entire expedition in fear of the icicles melting			1
[ related ] during the extreme climb , he broke his index finger , and one of the three other members in his team dislocated her rib			1
had it been any other climb in the world , he would have stopped for safety reasons			0
will , from @entity19 , @entity11 , said : ' even for experienced ice and mixed climbers , @entity9 is really off the charts - it 's a new frontier			1
precarious : as the area is notorious for fluctuating conditions , mr @entity6 spent the expedition in fear of the icicles melting the waterfall is so powerful it has formed a dent in the ground , and snow continued to fall throughout the trip during the trip , one of mr @entity6 's three teammates dislocated her rib			1
but they ploughed through as this climb is ' a new frontier ' the climb is widely regarded as the hardest mixed - terrain trek			0
mr @entity6 said it was the climb of his life and the team managed to do it safely ' every new frontier in sports is exciting and often dangerous			1
' one of the unique problems at @entity9 is that it sits right on the border between the ocean air mass and the interior air mass , so the temperatures can either be frigid , or warm up well above freezing in a matter of hours			1
' for me , it was the climb of my life , and i 'm really happy my team and i did it safely			0
@entity9 sits on the border between land and ocean , meaning the temperatures can rise or drop within a matter of hours temperatures dropped to @entity88 , which would be regarded as severe in @entity30			1
mr @entity6 admitted he would n't do the climb again at the top : when he reached the top , mr @entity6 had a well - earned rest in the @entity9 lodge ' one of the really cool things about @entity70 is that you can see it clearly from a visitor 's viewpoint			1
' it 's one of the most amazing places in the world , and yet you can sleep in a real bed at the @entity106 at night			0
' i just do n't want to climb there anymore - it 's never good to trust your luck too much			0
' using a couple of wires , a pick and an axe , these daredevils threw caution to the wind by heaving themselves up perilous cliffs of ice			2
@entity120 and @entity121 beamed at cameras as their feet dangled hundreds of feet above a life - threatening drop			1
the usually fast - flowing waterfalls in the @entity126 in @entity127 and the far north of @entity128 were frozen solid when temperatures in those areas plummeted below -20c			2
jaw - dropping : using very basic pickaxes , these two men fearlessly hauled their way up an ice cliff in @entity128 with life - threatening rocks below , @entity120 ( left ) led the way and @entity138 followed up climb in @entity128 for their men on wire project here and in @entity127 the climbers had to dodge deadly hanging ice curtains made of dagger - like icicles as they ascended			2
they hiked up icefalls ranging from 300ft to 659ft tall			0
the highest frozen waterfall the pair climbed was @entity149 in @entity128 which is taller than @entity152 ’s iconic @entity151 skyscraper			2
most of the waterfalls climbed by the pair were categorised ‘ grade five ’ , meaning they were near - vertical , requiring sustained climbing and offering little rest			2

but i have been ice climbing for 20 years so it seems normal to me			2
' ice climbing carries with it more risks than climbing indoors or even up rocks			2
climbing in cold weather is more dangerous as there are different alpine risks , like avalanches			0
' with ice you can tell when it is dangerous by the colour			0
if it is bright white then it is safe to climb , but a blue colour indicates the ice is less stable			0

@entity196 , who was taking photos of their expedition , said they were concentrating intently but had a lot of fun wildly hanging of cliffs mountain guide @entity196 , 40 , took photographs of the pair during their daring ascent			0
