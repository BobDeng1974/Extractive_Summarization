it does n’t look particularly out of the ordinary			0
but there are a few rather significant differences between this tap and the ones you normally find in a bathroom – not least the £ 999 price tag			2
dreamt up by @entity9 , the man who re-invented the vacuum cleaner , it combines hand washing and drying in one rather futuristic tap			1
first , the user must place their hands under the central nozzle , which breaks an infra - red beam and triggers a stream of lukewarm water			0
the drying process takes 12 seconds , and there is no need to touch any surfaces that might spread bugs			1
there is one thing it does n’t dispense , however – soap			0
while the @entity9 bagless vacuum cleaner became a mass market success despite its relatively high price , the @entity36 is likely to be more of a niche product , at least in the short term			1
its big innovation is the small and immensely powerful fan motor , called the @entity44 , which sits in the base of the tap			0
mass market success : the tap and hand - dryer was dreamt up by @entity9 , the man who invented the bagless vacuum cleaner high performance : mr @entity9 said the @entity36 hand dryers dry hands quickly and that the digital motor self adjusts 6,000 times a second to maintain optimum efficiency the 1600 watt motor is just 85mm across and weighs 675g , yet it is able to power a tiny fan from standstill to 90,000 revolutions per minute in less than 0.7 seconds			1
as a result , it can blast out 30 litres of air a second , travelling at 430mph			0
' most simply give up ' : conventional hand dryers use one column of bacteria filled bathroom air to evaporate water from hands @entity72 sucked into the @entity36 passes through a filter to remove 99.9 per cent of all bacteria before it dries the hands			1
the combined tap and fan is one of three new hand dryers developed by a team of 125 @entity9 engineers at its headquarters in @entity83			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ conventional hand - dryers use one column of bacteria filled bathroom air to evaporate water from hands , after much hand rubbing			1
‘ most people simply give up			0
@entity36 hand dryers dry hands quickly			2
sheets of high velocity unheated air travel through tiny apertures at 430mph , quickly scraping water from hands like a windscreen wiper , leaving them fully dry			0
‘ using complex computer modelling @entity9 engineers have developed a high performance digital motor			2
‘ the @entity9 digital motor self - adjusts 6,000 times a second to maintain optimum efficiency to create high velocity sheet of air that dries hands quickly and hygienically			2
’ the new motor came after seven years of design and experimentation , which required an investment of £ 26.9million .			0
