she 's often spoken of her love of animals but the enormous @entity3 that greeted @entity4 as she arrived at a @entity6 horse show probably was n't quite what she had in mind			1
the super-sized bird towered over the @entity10 as she gamely stopped for a chat with the actor inside , craning her neck in a bid to make eye contact			0
@entity4 's encounter with @entity3 came as she paid a visit to @entity18 , the @entity19 , a festive tradition of the @entity10 ' that has been going on for a decade			1
it 's behind you ! @entity4 meets performers at the international horse show including a giant @entity3 anyone in there ? @entity4 cranes her neck in a bid to make eye contact with the actor inside during the visit , which saw her take the royal salute from the president 's @entity32 before presenting trophies to the winners of the @entity36 , @entity4 , 67 , went backstage to meet performers			1
these included the @entity40 cossacks and members of the @entity43 's mounted force , who were at the show to take part in an annual activity ride			1
she also stopped to pat some of the tiny steeds scheduled to take part in the @entity48 , which was eventually won by @entity49 , who , at 21 , is the oldest animal ever to take part			1
while @entity49 was less than impressed by the trophies on offer , he did get a prize of his own in the shape of a polo proffered by the horse - loving @entity10			1
festive : other members of the cast included a fairy , a monkey and a sparkly elf giant : the @entity3 towered over the @entity10 - not that she appeared to mind @entity67 shot : the encounter concluded with a group photograph of the performers and the @entity10 @entity4 has had a busy few weeks and , last thursday , threw a @entity72 party for terminally ill children at @entity74			1
during the festivities , which saw the @entity76 serve the children a lunch of sausages and mash , @entity4 helped the youngsters decorate the christmas tree with strings of dried apple			0
she also persuaded her assistant equerry , captain @entity85 , to turn up in full uniform - including a bearskin hat - and give the delighted children a salute			2
next week will see the @entity76 join the @entity90 and the rest of the royal family at @entity93 for the traditional @entity72 celebrations			1
she will also be part of the group , along with the @entity97 and @entity98 and prince @entity99 , to take part in the annual @entity102 service at the estate 's church			2
hungry ? one of the pint - sized performers accepts his prize of a polo from the @entity76 ' outstretched hand animal lover : the @entity10 has long adored animals , horses in particular performer : the mounted division of the @entity43 participate in the international horse show the @entity117 has already arrived at the @entity119 estate and was pictured getting off the train at @entity122 station yesterday			1
@entity93 has been owned by the royal family since 1862 when it was purchased by @entity125 at the request of her son @entity127 , then @entity90			2
since then , the house has been in continuous use by the royal family and it was there that @entity130 died on the 6th february 1952			0
it is also from @entity93 that the @entity117 's annual @entity72 speech is broadcast , usually uncontroversially , although this year looks set to change all that			1
bookies , among them @entity135 and @entity136 , have suspended betting on the @entity117 revealing abdication plans in this year 's speech			2
impressive : @entity4 meets @entity40 cossacks following their performance at the @entity18 horse show international relations : @entity143 makes friends with one of the @entity147 horses winner : @entity4 presents a trophy to @entity151 showjumper @entity150 and his horse @entity153 do you know the way to @entity93 ? the duchess is introduced to @entity72 although @entity158 sources have previously said the @entity117 will never step down , betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers			1
' throughout the year there has been major speculation about the @entity117 's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise , ' said @entity136 's @entity167			2
' as far as we are concerned there 's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession , so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market			0
' a @entity158 spokesman refused to comment , but did point to the pledges made by the @entity117 in her 21st birthday speech in 1947			0
then , the @entity117 said : ' i declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong			0
' in her june 1953 @entity188 speech , she also said : ' i have in sincerity pledged myself to your service , as so many of you are pledged to mine			0
' big arrival : the @entity117 arrived at @entity93 for her @entity72 holiday yesterday on her own : the @entity97 has remained in @entity6 but will join her in a few days time although it is rare for @entity200 monarchs to step aside , with @entity201 the only monarch to do so , the practice is considerably more common in @entity202 , where no less than four have stood down in the last two years			1
2013 was the busiest year for abdications , with queen @entity204 , @entity205 of @entity206 and pope @entity207 all stepping down			0
the following @entity208 , @entity209 of @entity210 , 76 , announced plans to step down on the grounds that ' i do n't want my son to grow old waiting like @entity215 '			0
he formally abdicated on the 18th june , making him the fourth @entity202 monarch to do so in less than a year			0
new ruler : @entity218 of @entity210 is the newest @entity202 monarch after his father stepped down in june stepping up : @entity220 ascended to the throne on the 30 april 2013 despite the flurry of abdications , the @entity117 has always stated that she has no plans to do the same , despite being older than all of the four			0
one monarch who may yet do so is @entity228 's @entity227 , 74 , who has been on the @entity228 throne for 42 years and has an heir , @entity230 , of the same age as 46 - year - old @entity218			2
however , despite claims in an @entity236 magazine that an announcement is imminent , sources close to the @entity228 queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as ' all lies '			0
monarch : @entity242 of the @entity206 took his throne two months after @entity220 next up ? the @entity228 queen , @entity227 , is rumoured to be stepping down in favour of @entity230 ( right )			0
