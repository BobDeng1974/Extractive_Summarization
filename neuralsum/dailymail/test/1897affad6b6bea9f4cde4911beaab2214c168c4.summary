it 's the worst storm to hit the @entity2 coast in a decade , but what everyone in the region wants to know is why no warning was given that it was going to be this bad			1
climate specialist @entity7 from @entity8 confirmed that severe weather warnings were issued by the @entity10 on sunday			1
however , although they knew it would occur somewhere around the southeast coast , they did not know exactly where			0
' the storm was forecast to form between @entity17 and @entity18 - that ’s as about as accurate as they could have predicted			1
but it turned out to hit closer to @entity18 than @entity17 , ' mr @entity7 told @entity22			1
' it all depends on exactly where it forms			0
this one formed in the worst possible spot , which was just north of @entity18			1
it then covered 150km south from @entity18 to @entity28 where a third of @entity30 ’s population live			1
powerful winds on monday night and tuesday morning also brought down scaffolding ( right ) in @entity45 , in @entity36 's eastern suburbs a chart from the @entity10 shows the forecast for wind speed across @entity2 on tuesday night the @entity50 was one of the worst - hit areas in @entity2 and this car in the town of @entity55 got the brunt of the weather ' so it was always going to be very destructive			1
it ’s not like it hit a few small fishing villages like a storm did on the south coast a few weeks ago			1
' mr @entity7 also explained that those trying to forecast the weather had an even more difficult job now as there was not as much resources for them to call on and get the specific information they need			1
' our problem now is that any information that we can get from the upper atmosphere , which is where the cold air exists that initiates these types of conditions , is reliant on predicting satellite imagery , ' mr @entity7 told @entity22			0
' we do n’t send up as many weather balloons any more , because of budget cuts so it ’ll affect what can be forecast			1
' it ’s just economics			2
weather balloons can now only be used in a limited number of places because of budget cuts , so there ’s not as many going up every day which means we do n’t get the same data as before from the upper atmosphere			1
' mr @entity7 added that this information does not normally make a big difference , but it does in the storm season , because you can forecast thunder storms more accurately and pinpoint more accurately where these storms will be			2
' but basically this was fairly well forecasted 24 to 48 hours ahead			2
the forecast was basically wet and windy but the actual intensity of these things is impossible to predict , ' he says			0
' this storm has also lasted a bit longer and has n’t moved			0
normally it ’s 12 hours of severe weather and then it eases off			1
but this severe weather is lasting from 24 to 36 hours			1
' emergency services admitted on tuesday they were shocked by the severity of the storm and that their teams were overwhelmed by a weather system that changed very rapidly			1
asked on @entity114 ’s 7.30 programme if warning systems had failed , @entity112 deputy commissioner @entity111 said : ' the weather system did change very rapidly			1
' this was an east coast low initially which are always historically very severe weather system however they come in and they go very quickly , this did n't			1
this has just stayed and tracked , again we have never seen these cyclonic winds last for 24 hours straight that 's what 's caused the majority of the damage			2

the stormy weather system , formed in the @entity149 , has n't hit @entity2 this strong since 2007 and is expected to be one of the longest lasting ever			1
but why was everyone taken so by surprise ? @entity153 are particularly common in june and tend to be more frequent in autumn and winter			0
they are characterised by gales or storm force winds that can damage buildings , fell trees and powerlines , cause powerful surf that can damage the coast and , in some cases , run ships aground			0
they can also dump hundreds of millimetres of rain , causing flash flooding and riverine flooding			0
mr @entity7 told @entity22 : ' it forms occasionally , usually once a year			0
but this particular one is quite strong and close to the coast winds are up to 135kmh and rain up to 200mm			0
’ fire rescue in @entity170 , in @entity36 's northern suburbs , were called to a number of properties where storms had brought down trees ferry services have been cancelled at @entity177 ( pictured ) while services between @entity179 and @entity180 have also been stopped ‘ this one is probably the strongest since 2007 and it is also going to be the longest lasting one , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
‘ they normally move away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24 - 36 hours , which is unusually long for an @entity137			1
’ @entity153 draw strong , moisture - laden winds across the coast , which cause heavy rain to fall when they are uplifted by the hills and ranges that run parallel to the coast			0

state emergency services deputy commissioner @entity111 told the @entity114 on tuesday the police and @entity229 and @entity230 had been called in to help the @entity214 on the 2400 call - outs they 've received so far , with many more expected in daylight when people can see the damage around their homes			1
' we 've had 24 hours of relentless gale - force winds			2
i have n't seen this wind damage for years , ' mr @entity111 said			0
some have speculated this week ’s @entity137 will be the worst in five years , while meteorologist with @entity243 told the @entity244 : ‘ this is going to be our most significant east coast low since spring			0
’ ‘ the last major one that has affected @entity18 was in 2007			2

’ in june 2007 bulk carrier @entity267 ran aground near @entity18 amid wind gusts up to 124km/h			2

rain and damaging winds averaging 55 to 70 km / h with gusts to about 100 km are forecast to develop along the coastal fringe of the @entity302 , @entity50 and @entity276 regions @entity304 has started to fall at @entity305 in the @entity306 of @entity2 @entity305 will see a snow shower or two on monday with a maximum temperature of three degrees celcius on tuesday there will be a 30 per cent chance of a snow shower with temperatures expected to sit between -1 and 3 degrees the first major snowfall of the year has happened at the ski fields at @entity316 , in southern @entity2 near the @entity318 border the area 's forecast says to expect possible snow showers in areas above 1200m and temperatures between -2 and 3 degrees			1

@entity326 problem was that the @entity10 could not forecast exactly where the storm would form
storm was forecast to gather between @entity17 and @entity18 , but it formed just north of @entity18
it then covered 150km south from @entity18 to @entity28 where a third of @entity30 ’s population live
when the storm hit it caused the maximum amount of destruction because of it being a huge suburban area
budget cuts also meant the @entity10 did not have as many resources at its *disposal*
' it ’s just economics . weather balloons can now only be used in a limited number of places , ' says climate specialist
emergency services admitted on tuesday they were shocked by the severity of the storm
their teams were overwhelmed by a weather system that changed very rapidly
this weather system usually moves away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24 - 36 hours
