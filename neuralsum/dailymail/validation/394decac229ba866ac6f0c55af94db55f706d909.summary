what will it take for @entity3 fans to really love @entity4 ? yes , he is appreciated by the home faithful at the @entity6 but not to the same degree as other top strikers			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are worshipped at their clubs			1
but with similar goal - scoring exploits this season , @entity4 does n’t get anywhere near the same level of affection from his fans or the rest of the football world			1
he is valued as a player but not unconditionally loved			0
he deserves much more credit			0
of the strikers mentioned , only @entity9 has a better minutes per goal rate in all competitions this season than @entity4 , who is a good link man and an important source of goals for @entity3			1
@entity4 has scored 11 @entity31 goals - and 15 in all competitions - during an injury - hit season @entity4 rounds @entity35 keeper @entity34 during @entity3 's win in the @entity37 the @entity39 slots home past @entity40 during @entity3 's 5 - 0 rout of @entity42 he started the season in fine form and then was unlucky with injury but he hit the ground running as soon as he returned			1
after his performance in the @entity37 first leg against @entity35 , everyone rushed to criticise and dissect his game			0
if @entity10 or @entity9 have a bad game , there is no discussion			1
with @entity4 it is as if he always has to play well to win people over			2
he ’s never allowed an off - day			2
what has been impressive is the way he has bounced back mentally from that , scoring in four of his last five games			2
the only match in which he did n’t score was against @entity61 in the @entity62 , when he started on the bench			0
the circumstances of his arrival are part of the problem for @entity4			2
@entity3 fans have been fed a diet of pace and movement ever since @entity72 arrived			1
from @entity74 and @entity75 to @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity72 ’s forwards have always been about great mobility and raw speed			0
@entity9 won @entity80 the title in 2012 and the @entity82 is worshipped by the club 's fans @entity11 has burst onto the scene this season and is already adored by the @entity88 faithful @entity10 hit the ground running in @entity90 and has become a terrace hero amongst @entity93 fans @entity4 is not as quick or graceful across the turf but he was bought as a replacement for @entity96			1
he is an entirely different type of player , so that he has shaken off any unfair comparisons with the @entity100 is to his credit			0
it ’s also interesting that @entity103 and @entity104 were signed almost as @entity4 ’s replacements but the @entity39 is still the go - to man in the middle			1
his involvement shows how @entity72 ’s philosophy has almost come full circle			0
when he arrived he sold @entity110 and instead opted for pacy forwards			0
now he has reverted to @entity4 , who is in a similar mould — there ’s not a great deal of difference between a @entity117 battering ram and a @entity39 one			1
not to say they are one - dimensional players , far from it			0
@entity110 was technically sound , a giant in the air and provided a different attacking dimension			0
but @entity72 now seems to want physicality back at the top of the side			0
that means the team have had to play in a different way , though that is not a bad thing			0
@entity4 ’s link - up play is exceptional and @entity3 use him like a backboard , holding up play and waiting for others to run from deep and join the attack and he has been at the heart of many of @entity3 ’s best team goals			1
after @entity77 's departure to @entity61 , @entity4 was purchased to replace him @entity104 was signed to replace @entity4 , but the @entity39 continues to keep his place @entity103 has also been unable to dislodge the totemic striker from his role in the middle although he does not have the same movement as previous @entity3 greats , he is versatile and wholehearted , and that has endeared him to most of the fans			1
it goes without saying how powerful he is in the air and that has opened up a route to goal that has been for so long ignored by @entity72			0
@entity72 has an outstanding track record of improving strikers — i witnessed how he transformed @entity157 — and he is doing the same with @entity4			1
his only focus is on what players can do			0
and you can see in @entity4 the benefits of having a manager who believes in you			2
@entity4 has talked about playing out of his comfort zone to try to improve			2
he has done that and hopefully @entity3 fans will come to love him more			1
but ultimately for any striker , it should n’t matter what you look like or how you play , as long as you offer goals			0
luckily for @entity4 , he does just that .			2

@entity4 is appreciated by the home faithful at the @entity6 but not to the same degree as other top strikers
he has similar goal - scoring exploits this season as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , who are all adored at their clubs
@entity4 does n’t get anywhere near the same level of affection from his fans or the rest of the football world
although he does not have the same movement as previous @entity3 greats , he is versatile and wholehearted , and that has endeared him to fans
