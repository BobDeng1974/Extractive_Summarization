the ancient frog , named @entity7 , had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell			1
it was the size of an @entity17 bullfrog , growing to about 10 inches ( 25.4 cm ) across , and lived between 70 million and 65 million years ago			1
the ancient frog , named @entity7 , had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell			1
a new computer model for @entity7 's skeleton incorporates fossil specimens marked in dark blue			0
the scale bar at lower right marks roughly an inch in length the species bone fragments have been collected for nearly two decades , but researchers have only recently pieced the fossils together to reveal its incredible features			1
‘ we knew it was big ; we knew it was almost certainly predatory , ’ said study co-author @entity34 , a palaeontologist at the @entity35 told @entity36			0
‘ what the new material has shown us is that it was even more heavily armoured than we imagined			0
’ study also found the devil frog was slightly smaller than previously thought			0
it was the size of an @entity17 bullfrog , which grows to about 10 inches ( 25.4 cm ) across			1
pictured is an illustraion of what scientists initially thought the frog looked like compared with a modern frog , and a pencil added for scale the devil frog ’s name , @entity7 , came from @entity56 , the @entity57 for devil , and bufo - latin for toad			1
@entity61 means ‘ shield , ’ named for an armour - like part of its anatomy			2
the creature had monster flanges protruding from the back of its skull and armour on its back like a shell			1
it was the size of an @entity17 bullfrog , which grows to about 10 inches ( 25.4 cm ) across , and lived between 70 million and 65 million years ago			1
even though it lived far away , @entity7 appears to be closely related to a group of frogs that live today in @entity79			0
they are nicknamed ‘ @entity81 ’ frogs due to their huge mouths			0
some have little horns on their heads , and the scientists think beelzebufo also may have had horns			2
the first frogs appeared about 180 million years ago , and their basic body plan has remained unchanged			0
the devil frog lived during the @entity91 at the end of the age of dinosaurs , which went extinct along with many other types of animals 65 million years ago			0
earlier studies suggested the creature had a huge , round head as well as sharp teeth and short back legs			2
but the spiky flanges and plates in its skin were an unexpected discovery			0
scientists suspect the devil frog ’s body armour may have been an adaptation to a dry environment allowing it to burrow underground to cool down			1
the armour may also have been protection from dinosaurs that roamed the @entity3 during the same period			2
it was powerfully built and possessed a very wide mouth and powerful jaws			0
it probably did n't dine daintily			0
‘ it 's not outside the realm of possibility that beelzebufo took down lizards and mammals and smaller frogs , and even - considering its size - possibly hatchling dinosaurs , ’ said @entity119 of @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , when the team looked the frog 's body structure , they found that physically , it fit in with a family of horned frogs called the @entity139 , now found only in @entity79			2
however to reach @entity141 from @entity79 , the frogs would have needed to through @entity142 – a route which was submerged underwater by 112 million years ago			0
that would mean that devil frogs diverged from their @entity79 relatives before that submergence , pushing back the origin of @entity139 by more than 40 million years			2
researchers collected frog fossil fragments in the @entity152 in @entity153			1
the majority of specimens of @entity7 were discovered in the green sections shown on this map the skull of the devil frog is shown here			2
scientists suspect the devil frog 's body armour may have been an adaptation to a dry environment allowing it to burrow underground to cool down			1
areas of digital model representing actual specimens are shown in dark blue ; and missing regions silhouetted in grey			0
