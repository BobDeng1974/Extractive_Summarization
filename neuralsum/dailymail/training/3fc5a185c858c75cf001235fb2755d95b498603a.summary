a burlesque dancer has become an unlikely hero after getting fired for being ' too fat ' as she says hoards of women have reached out to her in support			2
@entity5 claimed @entity6 's dumped her because she was too curvy and accused the @entity8 club of having issues with her body type			1
but both high - profile figures in the burlesque community , @entity12 commenters and an army of women have lashed out at the @entity18 nightclub			1
she told @entity19 : ' the amount of women that have reached out to me and have told me like ' you 're my hero ' it hit close to home for a lot of people and in my own community here in @entity8 a lot of people have supported me			0
i know a lot of people who work at @entity6 's have gotten backlash from this and it 's unnecessary for employees that still work there to get harassed			1
' i feel that if anyone wants to work there they should , i just wanted to make it known that this happened to me and it was n't right			0
' ' i have had this happen before , i have been told ' oh sorry , you ca n't do a gig because of your weight ' you know it 's one of those things , you show up to an interview , you interview for a spot and you do n't get it , no big deal			2
' it 's not about me losing the job , it 's not about me losing the gig , it 's about someone saying i 'm too big to do burlesque , i do n't fit a certain body image to do burlesque and that is wrong			2
' burlesque is accepting of men , women , different genders , transgendered , it does not matter			0
' the club became the target of online criticism after performer @entity5 claimed @entity6 's dumped her because of her weight			1
rage had been part of ' the @entity92 ' show at the club			2
rage told @entity95 ' i have been working at @entity6 ’s for around a year			0
about three weeks ago i stopped seeing my name on the schedule , so naturally i asked about this because i thought it was a technical error with my phone / computer on my end			0
' ' i finally had the chance to speak with [ show producer ] @entity42 , and she told me that upper management did n't think that my body type fit in with the burlesque show , ' she told the website			2
@entity6 's said in a friday @entity12 page statement ' let 's face the facts , in the long history of the art there is an expected image			1
' the club also said that ' the world has a standard for burlesque and our dramatically comical musical show will achieve that standard			1
' @entity6 's cited a number of current and former burlesque stars who are not plus - size as examples , including @entity127 and @entity128 , and included a video of @entity131 champion @entity130 performing			1
the post received hundreds of comments - many of which slammed @entity6 's and came to @entity89 's defense			1
others pointed to @entity131 champion @entity137 as an example of a famous burlesque performer , who herself is a plus - size			2
speaking out : @entity6 's posted this @entity12 post in regards to the controversy examples : @entity6 cited @entity127 , left , and @entity128 , right , as examples of burlesque 's ' expected image ' second message : @entity6 's later posted a second statement online anger : the first @entity6 's post has received hundreds of comments - many of which slammed the club and came to @entity89 's defense @entity130 herself commented on the post , writing ' if a performer is able to entertain the audience , nothing else matters			1
and that 's my opinion			0
' the @entity166 criticized @entity6 's message on @entity12 saturday , claiming it was factually incorrect			1
writing for @entity95 on sunday , @entity137 said ' i read the statement [ from @entity6 's ] and was interested to find that they justify their argument using some sort of burlesque time machine with examples handpicked from the past to prove their point			1
to this sort of logic , there is no argument			0
it ’s like using @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 as examples of why power corrupts in politics			0
' @entity6 's published a second @entity12 statement sunday			1
' there was never a statement by any representatives of @entity6 's about size , ' the statement said			1
' it is a shame that people are using a sensitive subject like body shaming to incite a misled mob			1
the standard we clearly explained was about skill , costume and entertainment			1
' several @entity12 comments regarding the second post accused the @entity206 club of ' backpedaling			1
' joining in : the @entity166 commented on @entity12 about the controversy in the burlesque community statement : @entity5 has said ' it 's the talent of the performer and what they bring to that stage that really matters ' @entity6 's spokesman ' @entity217 ' told @entity219 ' it is my understanding that the point the [ @entity12 ] post was attempting to convey is that the changes were not specifically about size but rather the entire show			1
we are looking for more energy , better costumes , and more crowd participation			0
we have worked on this particular act since october and unfortunately there was little improvement			0
the worst part is this misinformation is now affecting other acts and in the end it will only hurt our loyal staff			0
that is very sad and i hope our fans can see past this web bashing			0
' on saturday , @entity42 wrote on @entity12 ' a lot of you have asked for comment on what is going regarding what happened with @entity89			2
i promise to make a clear and concise statement when the time is right			0
please know that this situation involves and affects a lot of people and creates a ripple effect far and wide			0
that being said , also know that @entity5 's community loves and supports her			0
' on a personal note , @entity5 and i are friends			0
we have talked extensively about this in private			0
and we will continue to be friends and work together for many years to come			0
' @entity42 announced that she ' will no longer be producing at @entity263 's ' on @entity12 monday			2
@entity264 reached out to @entity89 , @entity42 , and @entity6 's for comment			1
rage directed @entity264 to a statement she earlier gave to @entity219 , which said in part ' some may agree with @entity6 's , and some may not			1
but the bigger picture here is n't just this , it 's the fact that burlesque is something that accepts everyone			0
so please do n't sit in the corner calling a show burlesque when you truly do no accept everyone 's appearance			2
it 's the talent of the performer and what they bring to that stage that really matters			0

@entity89 has claimed that @entity6 's fired her due to her size
the club said in a @entity12 post ' the world has a standard for burlesque and our dramatically comical musical show will achieve that standard '
hundreds of comments *poured* in - many of which slammed @entity6 's and came to @entity89 's defense
in a second message , @entity6 's said ' it is a shame that people are using a sensitive subject like body shaming to incite a misled mob . the standard we clearly explained was about skill , costume and entertainment '
