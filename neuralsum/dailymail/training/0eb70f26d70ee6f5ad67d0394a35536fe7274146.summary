@entity0 axed after claim @entity1 are fleeing imposters in stolen army uniform she also said flood of terrified refugees are visiting ' relatives ' in @entity8 by @entity10 reporter last updated at 3:34 pm on 17th june 2011 for weeks she has been ridiculed for putting forward outlandish explanations for @entity1 atrocities - all in a perfect cut - glass @entity15 accent			1
but the @entity17 regime has finally ditched its flame - haired spokesman @entity19 , otherwise known as ' @entity20 '			0
@entity0 was absent from the airwaves yesterday in the wake of a series of interviews in which she has bizarrely claimed residents were fleeing ' armed groups ' dressed in stolen army uniform , and the flood of refugees to @entity1 were doing the equivalent ' visiting the next street '			1
she also accused journalists of being swept up in an ' eyewitness phenomenon ' when she was faced with requests for independent verification of her ' facts '			0
' q : can journalists enter the country to see the protests ? @entity0 : ' i know you have this ' eyewitness phenomenon ' thing			2
but we have our cameras everywhere and we have seen no gathering			0
' q : do you find video of children tortured in @entity1 troubling : @entity0 : i 'll tell you what i find troubling			1
i find troubling the misrepresentation of @entity1 overboard			2
i find troubling that there all these biased and troubling accounts of what happened			0
@entity80 why are people fleeing the army in @entity82 ? @entity0 : these people fleeeing are not fleeing the army because the army is not there			1
they are fleeing from these armed groups ... wearing army uniforms , they might be mistaken for the army			2
but the army has not entered , by all accounts , and this is a fact			2
@entity0 , the daughter of a @entity1 diplomat , has reportedly been moved from her position as director of @entity96 into a more junior position			1
her tv role had been an attempt to put an acceptable face on a brutal confrontation - but her antics soon earned her the @entity20 nickname , a reference to @entity106 's spokesman @entity105 - known as ' @entity107 ' during the 2003 invasion			0
his most famous gaffe was denying @entity111 tanks were at @entity112 when @entity113 were being broadcast from the runway			0
perhaps @entity0 's most bizarre explanation of @entity1 repression was her account of @entity1 refugees heading for @entity8			1
she said : ' a lot of them find it easy to move across because their relatives are there			0
it 's a little bit like having a problem in your street , and your mum lives in the next street , so you go and visit your mum for a bit			0
' it came as @entity1 troops backed by tanks and helicopter gunships swept into another northwestern city today , just days after laying siege to it			1
the @entity142 is also preparing to target @entity1 businesses with tough economic sanctions			1
the @entity8 prime minister is also visiting the flood of 9,600 refugees who have crossed the border from @entity1 since the repression began			1
big demonstrations were expected nationwide as the @entity1 people pressed on with the uprising to oust president @entity153			2
@entity1 - based rights activist @entity154 said large numbers of soldiers entered @entity157			1
it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties in the operation			0
many of the residents of @entity164 , a town of 100,000 on the highway linking @entity17 with @entity1 's largest city , @entity168 , have fled after @entity1 forces swept through the northwestern province of @entity171 last week near the @entity8 border			1
@entity173 of the @entity174 , a group that documents anti-government protests , said troops are in full control of the town			2
since anti-government protests erupted in mid-march , inspired by democratic revolutions in autocrat - ruled @entity181 and @entity182 , @entity153 has unleashed the military in region after region to crush street demonstrations			0
human rights activists say more than 1,400 @entity1 have been killed and 10,000 have been detained			2
the operation in @entity164 coincided with opposition calls for protests friday throughout the country naming it " @entity193 of @entity194			0
" @entity195 was an @entity196 leader who led an uprising against @entity199 colonial rule in the 20th century			0
safe but injured : a wounded @entity1 man flashes a v - sign in a medical tent next to a refugee camp in the @entity8 border town of @entity206 the opposition has been giving a name for every friday since the uprising began 13 weeks ago but using the name of an @entity196 leader was designed to show @entity153 's opponents were not rising up over secular concerns			1
the @entity153 regime is dominated by the @entity196 minority , an offshoot of @entity217 , but the country is overwhelmingly @entity219			0
@entity196 dominance has bred resentment , which @entity153 has worked to tamp down by pushing a strictly secular identity in @entity1			2
but the president now appears to be relying heavily on his @entity196 power base , beginning with highly placed @entity153 relatives , to crush the resistance			0
@entity154 , the rights activists , said troops are now massing around the town of @entity230 , south of @entity164			2
earlier this month , any army forces were attacked by gunmen in the area			0
two government tanks were damaged in the melee , the activists said			0
fleeing : @entity1 refugees are seen in a camp in the @entity8 border town of @entity240 a @entity1 military official was quoted by @entity242 , the state - run news agency , as saying the army deployed near @entity157 and @entity230 to prevent " armed terrorist organizations " from cutting the highway			1
@entity1 tanks and the government 's most loyal troops have been trying to prevent the uprising from gaining a territorial base for a wider armed rebellion against @entity153			1
some 9,000 @entity1 have already sought refuge in camps in neighboring @entity8 during the latest military crackdown , which authorities said was necessary to rid the area of " armed terrorists			1
" the government blames a foreign conspiracy for the unrest , saying religious extremists are behind it - not true reformers			0
