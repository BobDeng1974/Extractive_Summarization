by @entity0 evidence : @entity2 admitted today he listened to @entity4 's hacked voicemails but ' did n't know it was illegal ' former @entity7 editor @entity2 today admitted he listened to hacked voicemails left by mp @entity4 where he told his married lover she was ' breaking his heart '			1
in the messages the former home secretary was said to have repeatedly declared his love for @entity14 , as she tried to break off their affair in july 2004			2
@entity2 told the @entity18 hacking trial today he was played extracts of the messages in his office but ' at that stage , i did n't know it was illegal '			1
in some , mr @entity4 asked her not to end their relationship , which is thought to have begun in 2001			1
in one recording the @entity29 politician says : ‘ you are breaking my heart			0
’ in others , he tells her that he ‘ yearns ’ and ‘ longs ’ for her			0
the @entity18 heard previously police investigating phone hacking at the tabloid discovered 330 messages from mr @entity4 and associates hidden in a @entity7 safe			1
@entity2 said today he was ' shocked ' when his chief reporter @entity40 first told him about the hacked messages , while he was on holiday in @entity43			1
' @entity40 told me he had a tip that @entity4 was having an affair with @entity14			1
he said that he believed the story was true because he heard some voicemails			0
' i was shocked because he told me he had heard some voicemail messages			2
i was shocked that he was telling me this as well because it was in relation to @entity4 , the home secretary			1
' i was quite angry about it			0
i used reasonably colourful language , words to the effect " what in earth do you think you 're doing "			0
' he believed it was in the public interest and he wanted to play me some voicemails to establish that to effectively demonstrate that ' , he said			0
' i remember a few things , i remember a message where @entity4 was effectively declaring his love and also saying he had considered taking the relationship public			2
' i remember a phrase along the lines of ' i 'm going to blow this apart ' , a mention of a terrorism arrest , and also i have in my mind a reference made to @entity80			0
' @entity40 believed the relationship had been going on for three years ' , said @entity2			1
' and he also made mentioned of the possibility that there might be an issue of the paternity of one of @entity14 's children '			2
@entity2 said the more he listened , the more he started to think there was ' some public interest justification ' in the story but he wanted time to think about it			2
asked where he thought the reporter had got the vociemail by his lawyer @entity94 , @entity2 said : ' the conversation did not go into detail about that			1
if i made an assumption , it was @entity40 had done this himself			2
it was all coming from @entity40			2
' he added : ' i remained shocked - this was the first and only time a voicemail had been played to me			2
' later , @entity2 said he started to justify pursuing the story on the basis that mr @entity4 was ' distracted ' by the affair and he was sharing sensitive information			1
he said he took legal advice about the privacy aspect of the story			0
he concluded the story still needed to be stood up but decided that mr @entity4 was more likely to do so if the @entity110 did not name his lover			1
heartbreak : in the messages , mr @entity4 was said to have repeatedly declared his love for ms @entity14 as she tried to end their affair he said : ' i thought , rightly or wrongly , if i suggested to @entity4 that i would not name @entity14 , he would be more likely to confirm the story			1
' @entity2 told the court that , looking back , he ' should not have handled the story the way i did '			2
@entity2 authorised his staff to check if mr @entity4 met his lover when they suspected he would , as he still felt the story needed ' standing up '			1
he eventually resolved to speak to mr @entity4 himself to confirm the affair , and ran the story without her name because he was concerned about breaching her privacy			1
he confronted mr @entity4 about the fling before the story was printed			1
in a tape of a meeting played to the jury , @entity2 said : ‘ people know about this affair			1
i ’m not saying it ’s an open secret , but people are aware of it			0
’ paranoia over leaks rather than phone hacking at the @entity7 prompted @entity2 to send an email ordering ' do his phone ' , jurors have heard			1
the former editor denied the instruction to a colleague had anything to do with hacking the voicemails of celebrity @entity147 , son of footballer @entity148			0
@entity2 said an atmosphere of suspicion around a member of @entity110 staff led to the decision to inspect his phone billing data			1
he told the @entity18 : ' i was quite resistant to the idea of anybody working for me leaking stories but there was a growing body of evidence that was being put forward by some other people on the paper and in the end - reluctantly - i approved the request for billing data in relation to ( the member of staff )			0
' he told jurors he was in no doubt that the email he sent was not an ' instruction to anybody to hack anybody 's phone '			1
the risk of stories being published elsewhere was greater on a sunday newspaper than a daily and that led to ' paranoia ' over leaks			0
but he said : ' it was very destructive			0
it was all too much time and too much effort			0
' in the event , there was no evidence to support the suspicions surrounding the reporter in question , the court heard			2
mr @entity4 refused to confirm or deny it as his private life was ‘ not fair game ’			1
@entity2 said today he regretted not telling mr @entity4 the affair story had come from phone hacking because that would be brought it ' to a head '			1
' at this distance , i should n't have handled the story in this way ' , he said			2
' i should have stuck to my first instinct			0
' it would have become apparent very quickly what i was laying out was the product of an illegal act			2
' in the confrontation with mr @entity4 , @entity2 repeatedly refused to reveal how he knows about the affair			1
@entity2 told the court today : ' at least i would be able to argue my case			2
' at that stage , i did n't know it was illegal and i felt it was possibly justified			1
' it could have ended in legal action , it could have ended in police action			0
' i sincerely wish i had followed that course of action at that point			0
' on his regret over the @entity4 story , @entity2 said : ' it is easy to say now that what we were laying out in front of him was the product of an illegal act			1
' my view is that i kind of wish i had			0
it would have brought the whole thing to a head and i would have at least been able to argue my point			0
' i did not know it was illegal			0
how it would have ended i have no idea			0
it could have ended in legal action			0
it could have ended in police action			0
i sincerely wish i had followed that course of action at that moment			0
