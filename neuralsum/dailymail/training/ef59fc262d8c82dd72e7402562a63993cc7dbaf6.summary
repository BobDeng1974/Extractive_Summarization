by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:59 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 12:53 est , 27 december 2012 the daughter of jailed former @entity4 premier @entity3 has urged @entity6 nations to impose sanctions on officials involved in her mother 's imprisonment			1
@entity3 , the country 's top opposition leader , is serving a seven - year prison sentence on charges of abuse of office after a trial that was condemned by the @entity6 as politically motivated and which strained @entity4 's ties to @entity19 and the @entity20			1
@entity3 denies the charges and accuses president @entity22 , her longtime foe , of orchestrating the trial to bar her from politics			1
sanctions : @entity27 , left , said judges who jailed her mother , @entity29 , right , for seven years should be punished with sanctions , claiming the former premier 's trial was politically motivated with @entity3 in jail , @entity4 's fragmented opposition forces were unable to muster a majority in parliament following an election in october , and @entity22 's allies again control the legislature and the government			1
but in an interview on thursday , @entity3 's daughter @entity41 , 32 , said prosecutors and judges involved in her mother 's case should face @entity6 sanctions such as travel bans and freezes on bank accounts			1
the trial : former @entity4 prime minister and opposition leader @entity3 speaks at her trial as her daughter @entity41 holds her hand at the @entity57 districts court in @entity58 , @entity4 in october 2011 brought down : supporters of @entity3 carry her during a huge rally in @entity61 in @entity58 in 2005			1
but she was later jailed accused of abusing her office plot claims : @entity3 denies the charges and accuses president @entity22 ( pictured ) , her longtime foe , of orchestrating the trial to bar her from politics ' we understand that we can not do it by ourselves inside @entity4 and that is why we need great international support , but also ( an ) understanding of our international friends that @entity22 will not just voluntarily give up his power , ' @entity27 said in her mother 's office in central @entity58			1
with her trademark blonde plaits and fiery rhetoric , @entity3 became the glamorous heroine of @entity4 ’s @entity80 – before being jailed by the man she ousted			1
mrs @entity3 became prime minister after the 2004 revolution to rapturous public acclaim			1
it seemed @entity4 was finally set to throw off the shackles of its @entity88 past and embrace democracy			0
today , however , the defiant 52 - year - old – who refers to her distinctive plaits as her ‘ chain armour ’ that ‘ protects me from threats ’ – has become a symbol of the repression of freedom			0
suffering from a back condition , she languishes in a shared room in a prison hospital in the city of @entity102 ( pictured above ) , where she is serving seven years for abusing her prime ministerial power			0
despite the fact that she can not walk unaided , she is under constant armed guard with video and audio surveillance – testimony that she is still considered a major threat as a figurehead for @entity4 ’s opposition			0
her conviction has been criticised by the @entity113 as politically motivated persecution and also condemned by the @entity116 @entity115			0
meanwhile , she faces further charges of tax evasion relating to her time as head of a private energy company in the @entity121 and prosecutors say they have enough evidence to indict her for involvement in the murder of former @entity4 mp @entity127 in 1996			2
her lawyers argue that the authorities want her to remain in jail for the rest of her life			0
' people like judges , like prosecutors ... they have to be put forward for sanctions			2
those are the main executors of repression			0
' of course , there are people behind them who are in the ruling party , but it could be the first step			0
' the @entity113 suspended a key cooperation deal with @entity58 over the @entity3 case			0
separately , deputy prosecutor general @entity144 , who is in charge of the ex-premier 's prosecution , recently had his long - term @entity20 visa revoked			0
the @entity20 @entity149 in @entity58 would not comment on the move , citing its privacy policy			0
but the visa cancellation followed efforts by @entity144 to question @entity20 - based witnesses in a nearly 15 - year - old murder case in @entity4 in which @entity144 claims @entity3 is implicated			2
she denies all the accusations			0
her daughter also exhorted the international community to investigate and prosecute alleged instances of ' international corruption ' involving @entity4 officials in the @entity6			1
for instance , @entity3 has petitioned @entity20 authorities to investigate how @entity4 's @entity164 commissioned a top @entity20 law firm to analyze her trial for what @entity4 's government says was a mere $ 12,000 @entity3 's lawyer @entity169 has said that such a report must have cost well over $ 1.5 million and accused @entity22 's allies of paying for it illicitly			1
the report by the @entity175 - based firm , @entity174 claims that there is not sufficient evidence that @entity3 was prosecuted for political reasons , though it finds numerous flaws in her trial			2
the law firm has not commented on its fee for the report , which was dated september but not made public until earlier this month			0
@entity3 has been in prison for about a year and a half , but @entity27 expressed hope that @entity6 pressure could eventually free her mother so that she could run against @entity22 in the 2015 presidential election			1
' @entity22 's main task was to keep my mother in prison for the elections in 2015 , ' @entity27 said			2
' it ( takes ) great responsibility and great power and energy to stop this train that 's been going on the reverse side for @entity4 — away from democratic , @entity19 values			2

@entity3 was jailed in 2011 on charges of abuse of office
she served as @entity4 's prime minister from december 2007 to march 2010
she denies charges accusing president @entity22 of orchestrating trial
daughter @entity41 says @entity6 must put sanctions on judges and prosecutors
