eight - day - old @entity12 is understood to have suffered a crushed skull after being bitten just once by the @entity15 - cross			1
the animal has since been destroyed			2
yesterday it was unclear which family members were present at the time of the incident , which is said to have taken place in the living room of the family 's home in @entity25 , @entity26			1
eight day old @entity12 died after being bitten by a @entity15 dog while staying at his grandparents ' house in @entity25 , @entity26 @entity31 @entity30 with daughter @entity32 and grandson @entity12 who died after being bitten yesterday a police car sits outside the house in @entity25 , where @entity12 was bitten by a dog yesterday morning			1

@entity12 was rushed to hospital but died of his injuries soon after			1
the pet , named as @entity47 by residents , was one of two dogs kept at the three - bedroom semi where miss @entity39 lived with her own parents and younger siblings			0
just over a fortnight before giving birth , miss @entity39 , 19 , had tweeted how the dog had ripped the eye off one of the family ’s soft toys			1
police yesterday said @entity12 ’s death appeared to be a ‘ tragic accident ’			1
officers are examining the possibility that the dog may have attacked the infant after becoming jealous at his introduction to what the animal considered to be its territory			1
police believe that @entity12 , pictured , died as a result of the single dog bite , but are awaiting results of a formal post mortem @entity32 posted these pictures of a @entity15 - type dog on @entity78			1
however , it is not clear whether this is the dog that attacked her baby @entity15 breeders and an animal behaviour expert agreed the dogs could be both possessive of their existing family unit and jealous of new additions to the family			1
@entity12 ’s mother and father , @entity90 , 19 , were being comforted by their parents and police family liaison officers			1
one neighbour said at least one of the two dogs kept by the family was ‘ very vicious ’			2

‘ the dog is one of two kept at the house as family pets			1
‘ i often saw @entity32 ’s younger twin sisters walking them in the evenings			1
‘ i know one of the dogs is very vicious			0
i tried to post a @entity117 card through the letter box last year and it went for my hand as i posted it through			0
it was only small but a vicious little thing			0
’ new mother @entity124 , pictured left , posted this picture of her feeding baby @entity12 , right , on her @entity78 feed miss @entity39 lives at the semi-detached property with parents @entity30 , 42 , and @entity131 , 40 , a shop worker , and three of her siblings			1
her brother @entity136 , a 24 - year - old carpet fitter , lives around the corner			0
it is unclear whether mr @entity12 , a trainee electrician who lives in nearby @entity139 with his parents @entity140 and @entity142 , was still in a relationship with miss @entity39 , a part - time model who is one of six children			1
she gave birth to 7lb @entity12 on november 12 and posted pictures of her new baby on @entity78 , describing the infant as ‘ my life ’			2
heartbreakingly , just one day before her son was killed , the teenager wrote : ‘ not gon na lie this little boy gets far too many kisses			2
’ the teenager ’s profile on the social networking site also contained two pictures of a terrier - type dog captioned ‘ my doggy ’ , posted within the last six months			2
mrs @entity39 was so delighted at becoming a grandmother that the day after @entity12 was born she told a friend she could n’t ‘ keep my hands off him ’			2
the family of @entity12 told yesterday how they had ‘ no words ’ to describe the pain they were experiencing after the loss of the tot			1
in a statement issued through @entity175 , they said : ‘ we are absolutely devastated by @entity12 ’s death and have no words to describe the loss we have suffered			1
‘ at the present time we have no wish to speak publicly about yesterday ’s events and would ask that we are left in peace to grieve and begin to deal with our loss			0
’ mrs @entity184 , a nursery nurse , later described the family as being ‘ numb ’ with grief			2
@entity12 's grandmother @entity131 and grandfather @entity30 @entity189 , a @entity15 breeder from @entity190 , said the breed could become possessive of toys , family members or other pets in their environment			1
‘ they may happily live with a cat , but go after other cats in the neighbourhood , the same with children , ’ she said			0
police and ambulance crews were called to the scene of the tragedy just after 8am on tuesday			2
@entity12 was taken to @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity26 , but was pronounced dead shortly after being admitted			2
a post-mortem examination to establish the exact cause of death will take place today			1
detective chief inspector @entity211 , of @entity175 , said : ‘ our investigation is ongoing but it appears that the baby died as a result of a dog bite			2
’ victim : in april , five - year - old @entity218 was attacked by a @entity15 after reaching down to stroke the pet in a neighbour 's garden in @entity223 , @entity224 by @entity225 although small , @entity15 terriers are known for their feisty , tough nature			2
principally bred to hunt foxes , rabbits and rats , the breed is among the most popular in the @entity232 and is known for being ‘ a big dog in a small dog ’s body ’			2
dr @entity236 , an animal behaviourist and expert on dangerous dogs , said : ‘ if @entity241 were scaled up to labrador size they would be on the dangerous dogs list			0
they are very tough dogs			0
they can be very sweet , very lively and very playful , but they are also strong and powerful for their size			0
‘ they are bred to catch rabbits and rodents so they are reactive , terribly impulsive and incredibly fast			0
like any dogs @entity241 can form strong attachments , be quite possessive of their owners and jealous when a new baby is introduced			0
‘ however , an incident like this is very rare			0
the attachment a dog has to the mother of the child usually extends to the baby and , generally , dogs are very good caretakers and are protective of babies			1
something like this is very out of character			0
‘ most dog attacks on children also occur on toddlers because they interact with the dog			0
in this case an eight - day - old baby was obviously passive and , even if he was crying , should not have posed a threat to the dog			0
we do n’t know the circumstances of this tragedy , but if the parents were present there is a chance the dog lunged and moved so fast they could do nothing about it			0
no dog of any breed should be left around children unsupervised			0
’ brutal : three - month - old @entity290 was attacked by a @entity292 bull terrier and a @entity15 after his parents left him with his grandmother in @entity295 currently , police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people in public places			1
they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs under the @entity302 1991			0
these include the pit bull terrier and the @entity306 @entity305			0
some critics want the law to be extended so owners can be prosecuted when an attack occurs on their property			0
but dr @entity236 said this is a step too far			0
‘ you can not legislate for an event like this , it ’s just an awful tragic accident , ’ he said			1
in april , five - year - old @entity218 was bitten by a @entity15 after reaching down to stroke the pet in a neighbour ’s garden in @entity223 , @entity224			0
the dog tore a gaping wound in the little girl ’s cheek			0
