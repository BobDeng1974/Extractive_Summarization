by @entity0 last updated at 11:21 am on 12th december 2011 several @entity2 militants are on the loose today after tunneling their way out of a @entity5 prison in the second spectacular jailbreak this year			2
up to 15 convicts in the jail in @entity9 , southern @entity10 , escaped early on monday , according to a prison officer			1
a security official said 15 militants fled in the prison break , including 12 convicted for the killing of security officials and a bank heist			1
jailbreak : the latest reports of prisoners escaping jail in @entity9 , @entity10 is the fourth reported jailbreak in the country in the past eight years , and the second in six months			1
the discrepancy in the number of escaped prisoners could not be immediately reconciled			2
both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media			0
@entity10 , the @entity32 world 's poorest nation , has been wrecked by months of political turmoil and unrest			1
a popular uprising against longtime president @entity36 's rule - inspired by other @entity38 revolts that toppled autocratic rulers in @entity40 and @entity41 - has been met by a fierce government crackdown			0
the crackdown triggered widespread defections earlier this year by soldiers and officers who joined the protest movement			0
powerful tribes and their armed fighters also turned against @entity36 and waged battles against his forces			0
nearly a year of protests demanding the ousting of @entity5 president @entity36 , punctuated by bouts of fighting between his forces and tribesmen and military units who oppose him , have seen @entity62 gain power in the south			0
deteriorating security in the area , where parts of the @entity69 province are under control of @entity72 fighters , have fanned fears in @entity74 and @entity75 - which long backed @entity36 in its campaign against @entity2 - that the @entity5 branch of the group may gain a foothold near key oil shipping routes			0
gearing up to sign the deal : @entity5 president @entity36 ( right ) in a meeting in his @entity84 in @entity10 last month as he agreed to step @entity86 members , including one convicted in a 2002 attack on the @entity89 - flagged oil tanker @entity90 off @entity10 , escaped from a jail in the capital @entity93 in 2006 , helping to revive the group after @entity74 security forces weakened it in that country			1
@entity36 's foes have accused him of deliberately letting islamists in the south grow stronger to reinforce his argument that his rule alone can prevent the country sliding into chaos that would empower @entity2 , whose @entity5 wing has planned abortive attacks on @entity108 and other targets			0
@entity10 is also home to @entity109 , which the @entity108 considers the terrorist network 's most active and dangerous offshoot			1
islamic militants with links to the group have taken advantage of the country 's turmoil to seize control of several towns in southern @entity10			1
@entity10 has seen spectacular jailbreaks before			2
in 2003 , 11 @entity2 militants convicted for the 2000 bombing of the @entity123 , which killed 17 @entity108 sailors and injured 39 others , escaped from the @entity9 prison			1
in 2006 , 23 @entity2 militants broke out of a detention facility in @entity93 , including @entity129 , who went on to become the leader of @entity2 's @entity5 offshoot			0
and in june , nearly 60 suspected @entity2 militants tunneled their way out of a prison in the southern @entity136 city			0
investigations into these breakouts and subsequent trials showed that some prison security officers were involved in helping the convicts flee and several officers have been jailed .			2

@entity10 prison break in six months
among those who escaped were two convicted of killing security officials
