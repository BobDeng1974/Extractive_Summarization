when @entity1 was a talented midfielder of just 17 , he had to make a choice that would define his entire life			0
making the @entity5 first team that at the time boasted the likes of @entity8 and @entity9 or follow his family 's wish and train to be a pe teacher			2
@entity13 being @entity13 , he decided to do both			2
enrolling at the @entity15 to attain his coaching qualifications , he simultaneously trained with @entity5 - and he looked every inch the pe teacher when putting his @entity19 squad through their paces in @entity21			1
the @entity50 scored @entity19 's third goal in their 3 - 1 win over @entity53 on saturday strongman : @entity55 takes his turn to lift the weights as pre-season training continues apace barking the orders : @entity13 watches on as his assistant @entity60 issues instructions hard work , lads ? the players certainly looked as if they 'd been put through a hard session the @entity66 in @entity40 resembled a ' @entity67 ' as the players were put through a gruelling session of circuit training			1
a stopwatch and a whistle round his neck , @entity1 wore an unrelenting critical glare as his players sprinted and slalomed through cones , lifted weights and medicine balls , and took part in resistance training with an elasticated band around their waists			0
nobody was allowed to slacken off for a second			0
if they did , he would issue a stern rebuke or send assistant @entity88 to do it for him			0
when the players were granted a pause in the sticky @entity93 evening they looked knackered			0
@entity94 demands a lot - @entity95 ambitious : a young @entity1 ( circled ) lines up for amateur side @entity97			0
he harboured dreams of playing for @entity5 but also continued with his studies to become a pe teacher from the age of 17 good start : @entity19 have won all four matches under @entity1 's stewardship so far , against the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity53 stung : new signing @entity109 was publicly criticised by @entity1 for not being fit enough best foot forward : goalkeeper @entity112 at the end of a rope held by @entity115 hold on : keepers @entity112 ( left ) , @entity116 ( middle ) and @entity118 take part in the resistance training part of the circuit roll with it : the players also used medicine balls and barbells during the circuit weighed down : @entity47 smiles as he carries a weight @entity94 happy with squad it has become clear on @entity19 's @entity21 tour that @entity1 is not only trying to instil a new tactical awareness in his players but also make them the fittest and strongest in the @entity135			1
he had no problem with publicly embarrassing new signing @entity109 by saying he was n't fit enough and made him train on his own to catch up			0
it does n't matter if you 're the new Â£ 31m signing			0
even striker @entity140 , the ' teacher 's pet ' , has been told to prove his fitness before being allowed anywhere near the team			1
instructions are short and sharp , delivered in an authoritative tone			0
he 's not looking for a discussion , this is what 's going to happen			0
his biographer @entity152 captures this ' schoolmasterly ' approach well in his recent book			0
slalom : @entity112 steps through the cones as @entity115 waits for his turn behind quick step : @entity115 , who set up @entity47 's goal against @entity53 , gets his feet moving jog on : @entity55 and @entity162 take part in the warm - up return : @entity95 is enjoying his first pre-season in two years following struggles with illness get moving : the players size up the circuit as training gets underway in @entity40 in form : @entity172 has scored four times on the @entity21 tour as he bids for a first team spot thoughtful : assistant manager @entity176 watches on as the squad train ' the experience of daily interacting with often unmotivated or emotionally troubled youths at school has given these trainers a cutting edge , ' he writes			1
' this skills can be recognised in the way they deal with their adult charges - pro players - who can be just as testy and demanding as high school boys , and who intermittently require patient understanding and tough discipline			0
' @entity13 's critics are perturbed by what they consider the coach 's schoolmasterly style and tone			1
' in their view he is still the high school teacher : ever the smart - aleck , autocratic , comfortably convinced of the superiority of his own opinions , and no one should dare to criticise master @entity1 's methodology			2
' @entity13 has always refuted these @entity204 teacher comparisons but , watching him stood , hands planted on hips with an unchanging , unimpressed expression , as his @entity19 players are sent round the circuit , it 's hard to believe him			1
language - twelve different nationalities are represented in @entity13 's squad , but they have been told to speak @entity213 to each other			1
@entity13 himself is fluent in @entity213 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity37			1
@entity218 - @entity13 sees meal times as a good time for squad bonding , so he has replaced rectangular tables with circular ones to encourage interaction			2
meetings - each night at 10:30pm , @entity13 sits down with his coaches and senior staff to discuss player progress and plans for the following day			2
cameras - high - definition cameras have been installed at @entity19 's training ground and they have also been evident on the pre-season tour of @entity21 to track the players in training			1
new pitches - @entity236 training pitches have been laid at @entity237 and new trees have been planted to protect them from wind - a problem raised by @entity13 in his first interview as @entity19 manager .			1

the @entity19 squad were put through circuit training at @entity40 's @entity66 as they prepare to play @entity35 in @entity34
@entity13 *scrutinised* every player 's fitness as they passed
@entity37 worked as a @entity204 teacher before his managerial career
@entity19 have won every match on pre-season tour of the @entity21
