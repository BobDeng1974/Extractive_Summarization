its enigmatic circle of giant stones are always thought to have stood in splendid isolation on the edge of @entity5			2
but archaeologists now believe that @entity7 was at the centre of a vast network of religious monuments			1
the latest radar scanning technology has allowed experts to unearth a large but hidden complex of shrines , burial mounds and buildings used in gruesome rituals involving the dead			1
scientists from @entity35 spent four years mapping an area of five square miles in minute detail as part of the largest geophysical survey ever undertaken			1
unveiling their findings yesterday at the @entity41 in @entity42 , they described how advanced radar scanners were developed especially for the project to build up a digital map ten feet underground			0
among the discoveries is a 100ft - long wooden building , or long barrow , around two miles from @entity7 , built in @entity49			2
experts think it was the site of complex rituals , including the removal of flesh and limbs from dead bodies			1
the building is thought to have been used for seven generations by a single family before it was buried in chalk and forgotten for thousands of years			1
what lies beneath : archaeologists now believe that @entity7 was at the centre of a vast network of religious monuments			1
among the discoveries is a 100ft - long wooden building , or long barrow also unearthed were massive prehistoric pits , some of which appear to form astronomical and solar links with @entity7 – confirming the belief that it was positioned to reflect the @entity75 ’s movement			2
and the @entity81 ‘ super-henge ’ three miles away was revealed to have once been flanked by as many as 60 posts or stones up to ten feet high – suggesting a very similar structure to @entity7 itself			0
project leader professor @entity82 said archaeologists had previously thought most of the site was just ‘ green grass ’			1
he added : ‘ what we ’re seeing is this unconscious elaboration of the @entity7 landscape			0
' @entity90 ' : the technology was able to produce a 3d reconstruction and visualisation of the timber uprights that formed the mortuary building of the long barrow experts think it was the site of complex rituals , including the removal of flesh and limbs from dead bodies			1
‘ you ’ve got @entity7 which is clearly a very large ritual structure which is attracting people from large parts of the country			0
but around it people are creating their own shrines and temples			2
we can see the whole landscape is being used in very complex ways			0
’ the way @entity7 and its surroundings were laid out was a ‘ highly theatrical arrangement , ’ he said			0
as people approached the monument via an ancient procession route , it gradually emerged from the landscape			0
the structures can not be accurately dated until they are excavated – and any decision over digging lies with @entity126			0
a two - part @entity128 series – @entity129 : @entity130 – starts tomorrow at 8pm .			0
