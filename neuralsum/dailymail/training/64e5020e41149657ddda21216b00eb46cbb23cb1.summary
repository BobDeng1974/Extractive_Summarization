that , says @entity17 who published the july 31 picture , is a result of the fierce fighting that is blighting the north - western city			1
other images show the build - up of @entity26 troops and their rebel enemies inside the city itself , while further ones detail trucks on fire and cars in line for rapidly - running out fuel			2

@entity26 president @entity53 could seek to establish an enclave for his @entity87 sect as a ' plan b ' if he can not keep control of the whole of the war - torn country , @entity82 of @entity83 has said			1
this , he said , could prompt decades of further problems for the region			0
he said : ' i have a feeling that if he ca n't rule greater @entity5 then maybe an @entity87 enclave is plan @entity100 ' that would be , i think for us , the worst case scenario because that means then the break up of greater @entity5			0
' and that means that everybody starts land grabbing , which makes no sense to me			0
' if @entity5 then implodes on itself that would create problems that would take us decades to come back from			0
