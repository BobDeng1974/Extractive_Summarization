treasured by soldiers facing the horrors of the front line , and by their loved ones back home , these century - old postcards offer a fascinating glimpse into the personal side of one of the deadliest wars in history			1
as @entity11 raged across @entity12 , and long before the days of rolling news and email , families and soldiers kept in touch by sending postcards to and from the front line			1
now a previously unseen collection of pristine postcards sent to and from @entity22 families and soldiers during the @entity11 has been unearthed in @entity24			1
these postcards were exchanged between soldiers ( and nurses ) and their loved ones during the @entity11 the lord provost of @entity24 , @entity28 , right , found the cards among his late aunt 's belongings the cards and photographs give a poignant glimpse into the heartbreak felt by families during the horrors of the war that left more than 16million soldiers and civilians dead			1
some brought bad news , such as the card informing its recipient that their loved one had shell gas poisoning and was wounded and in hospital			1
others brought messages of comfort			2
' i have been thinking about you all today ' , says one			0
' i thought i would send a thought for you			0
' all of them give an insight into the pain and worry endured by millions at home and away during what turned out to be one of history 's bloodiest conflicts			1
the postcards were collected by @entity65 , the late aunt of @entity24 's lord provost , @entity28			1
mr @entity28 , who discovered the collection neatly packed away amongst her belongings after her death , does n't know how his aunt managed to compile such a wide - ranging collection , with cards signed by dozens of different soldiers and their families			1
postcards were often sent to the front line by worried families at home , offering succour ahead of hard times glimpse of history : the collection of century - old postcards is on show in @entity24 until wednesday all have been stored so carefully , their bright colours remain untarnished , although many of the handwritten messages on the reverse - particularly those written in pencil - have faded to near illegibility			1
the postcards have now gone on display at the @entity95 in @entity24 , where they can be seen until this thursday			2
mr @entity28 said : ' they were all very well stored in plastic bags and tied with bands			1
my aunt kept them all those years			2
' they span the whole war and there are many different names and addresses			2
' it 's possible that they each knew lots of different families , and they were encouraged to write to people at the front			2
' one postcard contained worrying news			2
mr @entity28 said : ' it is addressed to my aunt as miss @entity121 , as she was then , and says " got word this morning that @entity123 has shell gas poisoning and is wounded and is at present in hospital in @entity126			2
we will let you know later how he is			0
hoping to hear from you , love , @entity130 "			0
soldiers were discouraged from writing home because of censorship but plenty of them did , nevertheless @entity24 's lord provost , pictured with his wife , @entity136 , said : ' some would have been written in the trenches ' ' it 's quite a poignant message			1
imagine how terrible it would be to have to write that message			0
' another one is addressed to one of her sisters , and mentions someone called @entity149 who has not been very well and adds " poor chap , he is away back to the noise and the din " , which is one way of describing the front line			0
' and there 's a brilliant one with a nurse and " on service " written on the bottom			0
' on the back it says : " i have been thinking so much about you all today			0
i thought i would send a thought for you			0
this says ' on service ' , but we are all on service here , on a very noble calling , on service for our king , kindest regards , @entity169 "			0
' the front of the card is a drawing of a nurse in uniform , gazing into the distance			0
mr @entity28 said some of the cards were obviously friends or relations of his aunt 's family , while others bore no obvious link			1
some of the cards came from soldiers keen to reassure worried families , left , while others were sent to them he added : ' it is very difficult to pinpoint who these people were , but you get a real feeling from the postcards of how the war was affecting them			1
' these were all they had to communicate with , no phones and no modern communication , just a postcard and a pencil			0
some are quite difficult to read , some may well have been written in the trenches			0
' millions of postcards were dispatched to and from various front lines during the @entity11 , but letters from enlisted men were discouraged by military authorities as they had to be censored			0
the postcards are currently on display at @entity24 's @entity95 to mark the outbreak of @entity11 .			1
