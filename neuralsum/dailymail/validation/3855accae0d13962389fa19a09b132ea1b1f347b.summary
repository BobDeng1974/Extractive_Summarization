the @entity1 @entity0 was nothing short of disastrous for @entity3 , despite the fact the team spirit was clearly high before the first race of the season			1
pictures of preparations behind the scenes in @entity11 show replacement driver @entity12 playing a clever practical joke on his team - mate , @entity14			1
as @entity14 stood on the scales to take his weight ahead of the @entity18 curtain - raiser , @entity12 sneakily put his foot on the scale to add an extra few pounds on to @entity14 's weight			2
@entity14 finished 11th in the @entity1 @entity0 and was the only driver not to take a point in the race @entity12 had engine failure on the formation lap as he deputised for @entity27 but the images show that @entity12 was caught in the act , as @entity14 turned around to see his team - mate 's foot hanging in the air			1
@entity12 was standing in for @entity27 in the first race of the @entity18 season , after @entity27 was ruled out of the opener with concussion sustained in a crash in pre-season			0
the 22 - year - old @entity12 was left frustrated by his car at the race , though , as he suffered engine failure on the formation lap. @entity27 was absent from the first race of the season as he continues to recover from concussion @entity27 is scheduled to compete in the next race of the season in @entity46 on march 29 and @entity14 did not have too much more luck			2
he was the only man to finish the race and not take a point in 11th			0
@entity3 will be hoping for better fortune providing @entity27 returns as planned from his concussion for the @entity46 @entity0 on march 29			0
@entity52 cruises to victory in @entity1 gp			0

@entity3 did not take a point in the @entity1 @entity0 in @entity11
@entity14 finished 11th and team - mate @entity12 withdrew
but pictures before the race show the drivers were in good spirits
