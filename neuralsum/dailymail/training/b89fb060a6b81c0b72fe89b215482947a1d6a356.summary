speaking in front of a line of military vehicles at @entity15 , @entity0 declared : ‘ one year ago from a base here in @entity5 , our troops launched the operation that killed @entity4			1
' the goal that i set to defeat @entity20 and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach			0
' the president also used his speech to indicate that there would be a @entity28 presence in the country until 2024			2
his previous public position has always been that troops would be out of the country by a 2014			0

’ the @entity56 campaign , which had been angered by an @entity0 campaign ad featuring @entity84 and questioning whether @entity56 would have given the order to kill @entity4 , was cautious about taking @entity0 to task for the @entity5 trip because of the tradition of refraining from political attacks when a president is abroad			1
@entity93 aides said that the visit was to sign a strategic partnership agreement with @entity5 meant to mark the beginning of the end of a war that has lasted for more than a decade			2

before @entity0 landed , republicans had heaped criticism on @entity0			0
@entity146 , attorney general under @entity138 , slammed @entity0 for his “ plans during the coming campaign to exploit the bragging rights to the achievement ” in an article in the @entity152			0
@entity146 quoted a declassified memorandum by @entity154 , the @entity155 chief , that he argued included a “ responsibility - escape clause ” that meant if the operation had failed then blame could have been placed on then vice admiral @entity158 , head of @entity159 ( @entity160 ) at the time			0
@entity5 president @entity113 ( r ) and @entity28 president @entity0 arrive to sign a strategic partnership agreement on may 1 , 2012 at the @entity163 in @entity6 a done deal : @entity0 and @entity113 shake hands after signing the agreement , which outlines how the @entity28 will be involved with security , economics and governance @entity28 president @entity0 ( @entity171 ) and @entity5 president @entity113 speak before signing the @entity172 at the @entity163 in @entity6 , may 2 , 2012 the memo said : ‘ the timing , operational decision making and control are in admiral @entity158 's hands			1

’ @entity146 highlghted ‘ the way [ @entity0 ] emphasised his own role in the hazardous mission accomplished by @entity189 ’ and contrasted with @entity138 ’s praise of @entity28 troops when @entity192 was captured in 2003			1
@entity193 , @entity138 's @entity155 chief from 2001 to 2006 , said via twitter that the professionalism of the seals over the @entity4 raid was in contrast to @entity0 's approach : ' the special operators who have every right to " spike the football " are too professional to do so			1
the @entity93 might follow their lead			0
' @entity205 : @entity4 , pictured in his compound in @entity207 , was killed a year ago @entity208 , a former head of the @entity210 ’s @entity209 , wrote in the ‘ @entity211 ’ that @entity0 had made the right decision to order the killing of @entity4			0
‘ but his administration never would have had the opportunity to do the right thing had it not been for some extraordinary work during the @entity138 administration			0
much of that work has been denigrated by @entity0 as unproductive and contrary to @entity28 principles			0
’ mission : senior figures , including @entity222 , gathered to watch @entity52 invade the compound he said that although some were ‘ trying to turn @entity4 ’s death into a campaign talking point for @entity0 ’s reelection ” it should be remembered ‘ that the trail to @entity4 started in a @entity210 black site - all of which @entity0 ordered closed ’ and ‘ stemmed from information obtained from hardened terrorists ’ partly by harsh interrogation methods @entity0 had since banned .			1
