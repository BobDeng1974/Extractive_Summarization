the message upon entering the village proudly declares : ' @entity2 welcomes you , not litter '			1
but it appears the rather modest sign , planted in a bed of daffodils , is not having the desired effect			2
in recent weeks , one resident has become increasingly frustrated at having to pick up a deluge of rubbish outside her home , including condoms and pornographic videos			2
rubbish row : @entity18 has been causing a stink in her village with her anti-litter signs , which she felt compelled to put up after having to collect piles of detritus outside her home garish : mrs @entity18 's signs have been causing offence in some quarters due to the use of the word ' tosser ' and their ' ghastly ' yellow colour so when @entity18 decided to take a more obviously proactive approach , she could be forgiven for thinking she would have the backing of her fellow villagers			1
instead , the 49 - year - old has found herself at the centre of a storm after her bright - yellow signs bearing the slogan ' do n't be a tosser - take your rubbish home ' were branded ' offensive and garish '			1
she put up the placards after claiming to have collected 27 bags of rubbish along the roadside on her land in the @entity49 , near @entity2 , @entity50 in recent weeks			2
most were thrown from passing cars			2
the @entity52 * - listed @entity49 has been home to the @entity18 family for generations			1
mrs @entity18 has lived on the estate for 24 years with husband @entity57 , managing director of an agricultural company , and they have three children @entity61 , 25 , @entity62 , 21 , and @entity63 , 18			1
idyllic : the villagers of @entity2 in @entity50 , where mrs @entity18 lives , is clearly keen to keep their community tidy , but many have objected to the 49 - year - old landowner 's tactics ' shocking and shameful ' : mrs @entity18 with some of the rubbish she has been collecting along the roadside on her land on the @entity49 , including condoms and pornographic videos but her signs have caused offence to some villagers and two have been ripped down			1
@entity79 , chairman of @entity80 , who has lived in the village for 30 years , said : ' they are ghastly notices , an eyesore and they ’re rude			1
it ’s garish and defacing the countryside			1
i ’ve had about six or seven complaints from residents			2
i hope they will be removed			2
' mrs @entity18 , 49 , said : ' i ca n’t walk three paces around the estate without coming across litter			1
i have picked up condoms , needles and pornographic videos along with all the bottles , cans , plastic and paper			2
it ’s shocking and shameful			0
it ’s been getting worse in recent years			0
' i was inspired by a trip to @entity105			0
i was walking along @entity107 beach and the signs were along it			1
they said : ‘ do n’t be a bloody tosser - take your rubbish home			0
' controversial : mrs @entity114 says she sought legal advice and spoke to the @entity116 before putting up the signs she claims she had no idea what ' tosser ' meant until a friend commented on how brave she was using the word			1
' i had to look it up on @entity124			0
it was a bit of an " oops " moment , ' she said			0
' i was brought up with the @entity128 ’s @entity127			0
but before i put the signs up , i consulted legal experts and i made sure they were only on my land			1
i also sought advice from the @entity116 and there was no problem			0
' she added : ' i ’m sorry if the signs cause offence and i know there have been some complaints			1
i ’m a law - abiding citizen and if i have broken the law , i will take them down			0
' parents of children at nearby @entity145 were divided on the issue			0
@entity147 , 40 , who has a daughter @entity148 , five , said : ' i think they ’re terrible			0
there was something in the village newsletter about it			1
' it is a bit awkward to have to explain to a five - year - old what the word means			0
' @entity148 is just learning to read and when she saw the sign she asked what the word meant			0
' i think it is inappropriate and i do n’t even think it will work			0
' @entity163 , 42 , a full - time mother from @entity164 , @entity50 , said : ' i thought it was funny and puts the point across , but i can see some people might be offended			0

@entity18 *ruffles* *feathers* in village after sticking up ' garish ' yellow signs
