it took @entity1 a little bit of time , but eventually he subdued the player known as ‘ @entity5 ’ on thursday afternoon to make the third round of the @entity7			1
the @entity9 champion gradually asserted his authority to win 6 - 3 6 - 1 6 - 3 against @entity11 on the court known as the ‘ @entity13 ’ at @entity7			1
it took @entity1 one hour and 56 minutes to progress with a canny display that drew the errors from the powerful @entity17 , playing his first match in a @entity21 second round at the age of 28			2
@entity23 : @entity1 eased into the third round of the @entity7 at @entity7 @entity24 : the @entity25 will face @entity27 @entity26 in the third round in @entity29 easy : @entity1 claimed a 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 win over his @entity17 opponent on @entity32 the 27 year - old @entity33 will now face @entity27 ’s ultra-solid @entity26 , the world number 24 , who overcame @entity36 in straight sets			1
that is likely to be considerably tougher as the @entity27 gives little away			0
@entity1 served better than he had done in the first round against @entity40 , and it was an encouraging sign that he managed to often pull out an ace or service winner on those occasions early in the match when the @entity17 got him into trouble			2
playing someone he gets on well with , the @entity33 ’s mindset was a little scatty in the first set and there was plenty of chuntering at his bench			0
flying start : @entity1 broke early in all three sets and never looked back having gained his advantage pleasant : @entity1 was on court 1 in @entity7 , which is known as the @entity13 @entity58 : @entity59 and the @entity9 champion 's back - room staff watch the action the biggest alarm was when @entity11 forced three break points to pull him back to 4 - 4 in the first set , but he lacked the composure			1
the only time @entity11 , who when serving continually found his second serves to the backhand drilled past him , broke was when he first served for the match at 5 - 2 in the third			0
this was not a match that will linger long in the memory but he will have been pleased to get through the opening two rounds for the loss of one set			0
a fine balance between attack and defence will be required when he tackles the @entity27 on saturday .			0

@entity1 broke twice to *clinch* the first set 6 - 3
@entity88 no 1 raced through second set in *34* minutes with another two breaks of serve
another early break of serve set @entity1 on his way to winning the third set
@entity25 will play @entity26 in third round
