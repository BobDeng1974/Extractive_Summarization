authorities there give motorists unlucky enough to hit a moose -- and lucky enough to survive the impact -- first dibs on the very large and , to some , very delicious carcass			2
@entity70 of the @entity71 told boston.com in october : ' when a car hits a game animal , the person that hits the animal gets first dibs , ' some people do nâ€™t have stomach for wild game , so a lot of police departments keep a list of people who would like to pick up the animal			2
' if the driver refuses the road kill , police use the list to attempt to contact someone willing to come get the animal			2
' blood from the animal can clearly be made out in the front passenger seat			0
per @entity1 state law , @entity5 will have first dibs on the animal 's carcass -- if he refuses , state police have a list of people they know will be interested			1
