by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 2 april 2012 it ’s widely believed that global warming began in the 1970s , but new ocean temperature readings show that the @entity4 has in fact been warming for far longer			1
a study by the @entity7 in @entity8 traced ocean warming to the late 19th century , which implies , say researchers , that the @entity4 ’s climate as a whole has been heating up since then			2
the report is the first global comparison of temperature between the historic voyage of @entity18 between 1872 and 1876 and modern data obtained by ocean - probing robots now continuously reporting temperatures via the global @entity24 program			1
@entity25 is on : the oceans have been warming since the 1870s , according to new research the research , led by oceanographer @entity30 , shows a @entity31 ( @entity32 ) average increase in the upper portions of the ocean to 700 metres ( 2,300 feet ) depth			1
the increase was largest at the ocean surface , @entity39 ( @entity38 ) , decreasing to @entity40 ) at 900 metres ( 2,950 feet ) depth			1
scientists have previously determined that nearly 90 per cent of the excess heat added to @entity4 's climate system since the 1960s has been stored in the oceans			2
the new study , published in the april 1 advance online edition of @entity49 and co-authored by @entity50 of the @entity52 - based @entity51 and @entity53 of @entity7 , pushes the ocean warming trend back much earlier			0
‘ the significance of the study is not only that we see a temperature difference that indicates warming on a global scale , but that the magnitude of the temperature change since the 1870s is twice that observed over the past 50 years , ’ said @entity30 , co-chairman of the @entity55			1
‘ this implies that the time scale for the warming of the ocean is not just the last 50 years but at least the last 100 years			0
’ although the @entity18 data set covers only some 300 temperature soundings ( measurements from the sea surface down to the deep ocean ) around the world , the information sets a baseline for temperature change in the world 's oceans , which are now sampled continuously through @entity24 's unprecedented global coverage			1
nearly 3,500 free - drifting profiling @entity24 floats each collect a temperature profile every 10 days			2
making a splash : @entity18 travelled nearly 70,000 miles for its research mission @entity30 believes the new findings , a piece of a larger puzzle of understanding the earth 's climate , help scientists to understand the longer record of sea - level rise , because the expansion of seawater due to warming is a significant contributor to rising sea level			0
what ’s more , the 100 - year timescale of ocean warming implies that the @entity4 's climate system as a whole has been gaining heat for at least that long			0
@entity18 was a former battleship modified to carry out @entity106 collected sealife and sediment samples and measured ocean temperatures on a marathon 68,890 mile voyage			0
the steam - assisted ship carried a crew of 243 officers and scientists who worked in on - board laboratories .			0

@entity119 surface temperature has risen @entity39 ( @entity38 ) since the 1870s
