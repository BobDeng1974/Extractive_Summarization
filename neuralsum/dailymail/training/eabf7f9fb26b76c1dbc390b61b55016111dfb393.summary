they could be the ultimate gadget for the post @entity3 lull - glasses than can tell when you 're about to nod off			0
@entity7 firm @entity6 says its meme smart spectacles are able to determine levels of mental and physical tiredness by monitoring eye movements			1
they can also keep an eye on health , and even improve posture as sensors check you the wearer is sitting			1
the glasses use bio-sensing technology to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety , wellness and health			1
the sensors sit on the nose and near the ears of the user , measuring the electrical potential in eye movements			1
the voltage differences between the cornea and retina can be translated into data for parameters such as alertness , the firm says			2
the glasses use bio-sensing technology to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety , wellness and health			1
three electrooculography electrodes installed where the frame touches the face and six - axis sensors along the earpiece constantly capture information about the wearer			2
the sensors sit on the nose and near the ears of the user , measuring the electrical potential in eye movements			1
the voltage differences between the cornea and retina can be translated into data for parameters such as alertness , the firm says			2
' recovery rates from tiredness in humans drop dramatically once a certain threshold is crossed			2
@entity73 can detect and alert you to those levels before reaching that point , providing a new kind of management tool for preventing tiredness from accumulating and for improving work efficiency , ' the firm says			1
in plans to launch the glasses for the first time in the @entity84 at the @entity85 in @entity86 from january 6 - 9			0
' developed following nearly five years of research with leading academics and doctors in @entity7 , sensors in @entity73 capture information from your body to encourage better health , safety and wellness actions via the companion @entity73 app for @entity99 and @entity100			1
an app analyses data from the sensors to work out exactly how we are standing , sitting and how alert or tired the wearer is			1
the firm is working with doctors and researchers to explore additional features , such as measuring interest levels , providing biofeedback for focus - training exercises and possible diagnostic applications for cognitive and neurodegenerative diseases			2
' since launching @entity73 in 2001 , we have encouraged people to change the way they view the world , to enrich their lives and unlock new experiences through eyewear , ' said said ceo @entity122			0
' with @entity73 , we are changing the game for digital eyewear with a focus on both function and fashion			0

' @entity73 measures how our eyes and body move , ' said dr. @entity142 , professor of @entity144 's @entity143 , who has worked closely with @entity73 in the development of the glasses			0
' from these movements , we can gather a huge amount of biological information			0
and we 're just starting to see the possibilities			0
we 're excited to explore other different uses and applications for @entity73			0

@entity7 firm say specs can monitor mental and physical tiredness
sensors in the arms and nose bridge to detect tiny changes
can also track where you look , and how often you blink
can analyse these eye and body movements in accompanying app
