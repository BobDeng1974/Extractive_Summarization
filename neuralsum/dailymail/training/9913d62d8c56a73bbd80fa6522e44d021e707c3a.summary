tens of thousands of young families caught crossing the border illegally earlier this year subsequently failed to meet with federal immigration agents , as they were instructed , the @entity0 has acknowledged privately			2
an official with @entity6 revealed that about 70 percent of immigrant families the @entity9 administration had released into the @entity10 never showed up weeks later for follow - up appointments			1
the @entity6 official made the disclosure in a confidential meeting at its @entity16 headquarters with immigration advocates participating in a federal working group on detention and enforcement policies			1
the @entity21 obtained an audio recording of wednesday 's meeting and separately interviewed participants			0
the @entity0 has privately acknowledged that roughly 70 percent of young families caught crossing the border illegally this year subsequently failed to meet with federal immigration agents , as they were instructed , and now roam free in the @entity10 on the recording obtained by the @entity21 , the government did not specify the total number of families released into the @entity10 since october			1
since only a few hundred families have already been returned to their home countries and limited @entity10 detention facilities can house only about 1,200 family members , the 70 percent figure suggests the government released roughly 41,000 members of immigrant families who subsequently failed to appear at federal immigration offices			1
the official , who was not identified by name on the recording obtained by the @entity21 , also said final deportation had been ordered for at least 860 people traveling as families caught at the border since may but only 14 people had reported as ordered			2
in a statement , @entity6 spokeswoman @entity47 did not respond to questions from the @entity21 about the newly disclosed figures			0
instead , she said the agency was committed to increasing its capacity to detain and quickly deport families who crossed the border illegally			0
the @entity21 reported in june that the administration would not say publicly how many immigrant families from @entity57 caught crossing into the @entity10 it had released in recent months or how many of those subsequently reported back to the government after 15 days as directed			1
the @entity21 noted that senior @entity10 officials directly familiar with the issue , including at the @entity0 and @entity63 , had dodged the answer on at least seven occasions over two weeks , alternately saying that they did not know the figure or did n't have it immediately at hand			0
the @entity0 's public affairs office during the same period did not answer roughly a dozen requests for the figures			0
data suggests the government released and promptly lost track of roughly 41,000 members of immigrant families last year more than 66,000 immigrants traveling as families , mostly mothers and young children , have been apprehended at the border since the start of the budget year in october			1
nearly 60,000 of those immigrants are from @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 and can not be immediately repatriated , so the government has been releasing them into the @entity10 and telling them to report within 15 days to the nearest @entity6 offices			2
at the meeting , the @entity6 official acknowledged the no - show figures while explaining the administration 's decision in june to open a temporary detention center for families in @entity97 , @entity98			1
a second immigration jail in @entity100 was later converted for families and can house about 530 people			0
a third such detention center will open in @entity100 later this year			0
before the new facility in @entity97 , the government had room for fewer than 100 people at its only family detention center in @entity109			0
immigration advocates have complained that the new detention centers were punishing immigrants who ultimately may win lawful asylum claims to remain in the @entity10 in the meeting , they also questioned whether immigration officials had clearly and properly instructed immigrants to meet with federal agents within 15 days			2
the @entity6 official said it was necessary to detain families to ensure they did n't vanish into the @entity10 he encouraged advocacy groups to help find ways to ensure that immigrants reported to federal agents as ordered so the government could begin processing their cases , including any requests to remain in the @entity10 legally .			1
