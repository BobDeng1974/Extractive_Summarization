by @entity0 last updated at 5:12 pm on 28th february 2012 @entity1 was accused of ' working against ' his @entity3 partners last night after he demanded yet more changes to the government 's troubled @entity6 reforms			2
the deputy prime minister has got @entity10 's agreement to a string of amendments after first signing off the legislation when it was originally introduced and then obtaining a series of changes last spring			2
mr @entity1 said that if the latest changes , which will limit competition and the role of the private sector , are approved by @entity21 the reforms should be ' allowed to proceed '			1
@entity6 treatment transformation ? @entity1 ( right ) is trying to placate his party for supporting the controversial @entity24 the concessions agreed by the prime minister will help the @entity28 leader survive his party 's spring conference next month which is likely to be dominated by angry demands from anti-privatisation activists			1
but mr @entity1 's behaviour was called ' outrageous ' by @entity36 backbenchers who said he should be bound by collective cabinet responsibility			2
the changes were announced in a letter from mr @entity1 and @entity28 peer @entity40			1
it was sent to all @entity28 peers and mps as the @entity45 reconvened to debate the @entity46			1
the controversial legislation will give @entity48 control of most of the @entity6 budget and open up the @entity51 to greater competition from the private and voluntary sector			1
mr @entity1 and @entity40 said competition in the @entity6 must be in the ' interests of patients and not profits ' , adding : ' given how precious the @entity6 is , we want to rule out beyond doubt any threat of a @entity61 - style market in the @entity6			2
prime minister @entity10 speaks , as mr @entity62 looks on , during a round table discussion on the proposed @entity6 reorganisation at @entity65 last week ' that is why we want to see changes made to this @entity68 that have been put forward by our @entity28 team in the @entity45 to make sure that the @entity6 can never be treated like the gas , electricity and water industry			1
' mr @entity1 said the five changes he wants are his party 's ' final ' demands			0
they will reduce the remit of the @entity78 , require foundation trusts to put patients ' interests first and get permission from their governors before carrying out extra private work , and force members of clinical commissioning groups to declare all financial interests			1
deputy pm evokes @entity88 in his drive for @entity45 shake up another amendment is designed to insulate the @entity6 from the full force of @entity93 competition law to prevent private takeovers of hospitals			1
mr @entity1 's language in the letter is in stark contrast to the way he talked about the health reforms at the start of the @entity3			0
increasing competition in the health service brings benefits for patients and boosts productivity , according to a new report			1
the centre - right think - tank reform published 10 case studies from around the world showing how a ' radical change in the delivery of healthcare can result in improved quality and productivity '			0
it said competition allows new organisations to run services better , more efficiently and often at a lower cost			2
and it argued the government must defend competition clauses in the @entity46 as it passes through @entity21			2
in examples from the @entity61 , the study says competition can cut hospital admissions and costs			2
' in @entity130 , a private company , @entity132 , has created an integrated care pathway for mental healthcare services , which were previously highly fragmented , ' it said			2
' in one year the cost of mental healthcare hospitalisations for children was cut by 20 per cent			0
' in summer 2010 he signed the foreword to the @entity140 outlining the original reforms			0
and when the @entity68 was introduced to @entity21 he described them as a ' fusion ' of the best of @entity28 and @entity36 principles			1
but when @entity28 activists rebelled at their spring conference last march he changed his tune , demanding a ' pause ' in the progress of the @entity68 and a ' listening exercise ' with @entity6 staff			1
this led to a raft of changes , after which @entity152 and other @entity28 declared themselves satisfied			1
however , rumblings from party activists and peers in advance of this year 's spring conference appear to have forced mr @entity1 to demand more concessions			0
a @entity165 source said health secretary @entity62 was happy with the changes			0
it has yet to be decided whether @entity36 peers will be pressured to vote for the new amendments			0
it appears mr @entity1 's letter came as a surprise to many of his @entity3 partners			0
some observers say , however , it was a stage - managed enterprise to put him in a better light with his grassroots			0
in the morning , the prime minister 's spokesman said they did not see the need for any ' significant changes ' to the @entity68 , while at lunchtime @entity36 health minister @entity183 insisted the whole government backed the @entity68 ' as amended now '			0
but in the afternoon , mr @entity10 's spokesman revealed he had agreed to the changes the @entity28 wanted			1
@entity36 backbencher @entity187 said : ' it is outrageous that @entity1 is being allowed to do this			0
he is a member of the @entity190 and he should be signed up to collective responsibility			0
' he should be putting the case to his @entity28 colleagues as to why we need this @entity68			1
he should not be actively working against the government			0
it is not good enough that @entity10 is going along with this			0

@entity28 dems are opposed to both increasing competition and giving ' *favours* ' to the private sector
