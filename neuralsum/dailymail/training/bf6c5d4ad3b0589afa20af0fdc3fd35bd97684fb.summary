the hoarder , who was sewing under a tree in her front garden , seemed completely oblivious to the negative attention she was drawing about her neglected and trashed dwelling			0
the two cars parked on the front yard are barely visible as the vehicles are surrounded by tonnes of boxes and plastic bags full of even more junk			2
a trailer is also parked in the driveway jammed packed and overflowing with gallons of rubbish			0
the three rubbish bins provided by the council look as they were filled to the brim quite some time ago with rubbish also sitting on top of the closed lids			2
