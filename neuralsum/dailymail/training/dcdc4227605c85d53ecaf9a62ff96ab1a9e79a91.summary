by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 7 july 2012 updated : 08:39 est , 8 july 2012 a huge turnout of voters was reported all over @entity3 yesterday in the country ’s first free national elections for more than 40 years			1
jubilant crowds in the capital @entity8 formed long queues at polling stations , with many voters dressed in the green , black and red of @entity3			1
some carried flags and balloons , while others were in tears as they spoke of the bloody price the country had paid to achieve liberation			1
‘ this is the best moment of my life , ’ said student @entity21 , 18			1
‘ but my brothers died to get us to this day			2
now it is our duty to start building @entity3 into the greatest country in the world			2
’ change : women queue to cast their vote in @entity8 yesterday old men in their sunday best talked of the historic meaning of a day when they could choose their next government			1
one candidate standing as an independent , dr @entity36 , said : ‘ this is unbelievable , just to stand here and be able to cast a vote for the people we want to run our country			1
i do n’t even care if i win a place or not			2
’ an impressive 80 per cent of those eligible to vote had registered – 2.8 million out of @entity3 ’s 6.5 million population			1
but the orderliness of @entity8 ’s 30 polling stations and an eerie calm in the city as it sweltered in 38c heat , gave the lie to chaos elsewhere in the country			1
fears of threats from illegal militias and calls for an election boycott marred the process by which a 200 - seat @entity60 will elect a prime minister and cabinet and form a body to draft a new constitution			1
in the restive east of @entity3 , a growing number of armed militias have set up fortified compounds where they operate outside of the law , several of them declaring themselves martyrs and followers of religious fundamentalists			2
hope : a young @entity76 boy wears the red , black and green of @entity3 in the event of election results displeasing them , they are capable of destabilising the region			2
yesterday , gunshots were reported in city streets			2
fundamentalists have been blamed for several recent attacks on foreign targets			0
@entity89 ambassador @entity88 ’s convoy of vehicles was ambushed by a rocket attack near the @entity93 ’s office in @entity76 four weeks ago and the offices of the @entity95 were another target			0
deeply held suspicions that the east will continue to be marginalised in government fund allocation has led to the formation of the @entity101 by tribal leaders and former rebel commanders who demand semi-autonomy			0
they blockaded the main coastal highway last week in protest at the elections , while other factions took over oil installations in @entity111 and @entity112 , and saboteurs burned down election offices in @entity115			0
turning point : an impressive 80 per cent of those eligible to vote had registered - 2.8 ¿ million out of @entity3 ¿ s 6.5 ¿ million population in the south , election observers were unable to reach the tribal areas around @entity121 due to infighting between the @entity124 and @entity125 people , while militia clashes in the @entity127 killed dozens			1
fears are also being expressed for the resolution of the east - west divide dating back to @entity133 ’s rule , and the power struggle between secularists and @entity136			0
four main parties have emerged as frontrunners , with the fundamentalist @entity139 expected to make huge gains as they have recently done in neighbouring @entity141 and @entity142			0
the @entity143 , @entity144 , is backed by @entity146 cleric @entity145 with controversial former @entity133 prisoner and @entity148 as its best - known candidate			0
the @entity150 , a coalition of 58 political parties headed by @entity152 , prime minister in the aftermath of @entity3 ’s revolution last year , is seen as being the most liberal of the frontrunners			0
the @entity157 is putting up 45 candidates , and is popular for its consistent campaign against @entity133			0
