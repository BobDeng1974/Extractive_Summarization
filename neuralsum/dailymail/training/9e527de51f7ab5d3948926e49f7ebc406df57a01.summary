by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 18 september 2012 this surprising video shows that gorillas are just as amazed as us at the wonders of nature			2
the unusual footage suggests this group of primates from @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , would be just as delighted as us to sit down and watch one of @entity15 's shows			1
at first , it looks as though the hulking gorillas , who are around 100,000 times heavier than the caterpillar they are ogling , may be about to eat it			1
but in fact , the gorillas seem to be simply intently watching the movements of the furry little thing - following their progress with their huge black eyes just inches from the insect			1
the anthropomorphic primates seem to communicate as they huddle around the caterpillar to take a look			2
one gorilla even bats his companion 's head away from the animal - whether to get a better look or fend off greedy advances , it is not clear			0
hands off ! one gorilla bats the other away to give him room to look at the caterpillar wonders of nature : a third primate turns up , eager to get a look at the furry insect - just as we would stare at gorillas in a zoo the little creature does not seem particularly intimidated as it scurries busily along the metal wires of the gorilla enclosure			1
the @entity76 video has had more than 25,000 views , with many describing the clip released by the zoo as ' funny ' and ' entertaining '			0
others , however , express sympathy for the ' bored ' gorillas - who certainly wo n't have the option of watching an action film in there			0
there could even be a more disturbing lesson in what seems to be an innocently entertaining video			0
' we are entertained by the gorillas being entertained by a caterpiller , one step up on the evolutionary chain ï»¿ ... ' wrote one @entity96 added : ' i wonder whats watching us ? ' video : watch the curious gorillas here ... !			0
