@entity0 take on @entity1 at the @entity2 on wednesday night , knowing they have their best chance for years to reach the @entity5 quarter - finals			1
but in their way are a team in form , with a strong defence and some dangerous players - and old foes - going forward			0
@entity13 's @entity12 tells you all you need to know about the @entity16 club ... the @entity1 players share a laugh while training on the @entity2 pitch ahead of the @entity5 tie who 's the boss ? @entity24 manager @entity23 is n’t the best known manager left in the competition , but that wo n’t faze him			1
despite being only 40 , the @entity1 boss already has 13 years of coaching experience behind him , joining @entity30 as assistant manager in 2001 before moving into the top job two years later			1
spells at @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 led to a move to @entity39 side @entity38 before he returned to @entity40 to take charge of @entity42 in 2013			0
he took over at @entity1 last summer			2
at 40 years old @entity23 is still young for a manager , but has plenty of experience in football @entity47 is @entity1 's crucial playmaker and will try to dictate the game from the middle of the park who are the dangermen ? 4 @entity1 scored just four goals on their way to finishing top of @entity56 , accumulating 11 points			1
2 + @entity0 have scored at least two goals in their last five @entity5 matches			2
5 @entity1 have kept five clean sheets in their previous six matches in the @entity5			2
@entity47 will pull the strings in central midfield and @entity0 ’s ball - winner @entity63 will have to harry the @entity40 international			2
@entity0 must also stop @entity1 ’s box - to - box midfielder @entity67			1
the @entity68 should know about the @entity16 international , having scouted him extensively in recent seasons			0
@entity71 has added pace and trickery to @entity1 ’s attack from the flanks			0
and then , of course , there ’s @entity78 ... any familiar faces ? having spent eight years gracing the @entity81 with his poise , skill and swagger , all eyes will be on @entity78			0
@entity78 will present a familiar threat as he seeks to prove he is still a top - level player @entity47 and @entity67 , who @entity0 have previously scouted , are the players to watch the former @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 man will want to prove he can still cut the mustard against @entity94 ’s elite			1
likewise , @entity47 is a name that ’s become well known in @entity94 football in recent years — particularly during transfer windows			0
the @entity24 was constantly linked with @entity89 during the @entity99 era .			0

@entity1 are fourth in @entity101 , but could cause @entity0 problems
manager @entity23 is only 40 , but has been around a while
former @entity91 and @entity89 striker @entity78 could start
