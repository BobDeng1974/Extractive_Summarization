by @entity0 published : 18:36 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 23 january 2013 @entity2 engineers are leading pioneering research to see if train carriages can be ' bomb - proofed ' to reduce the carnage caused by terrorist attacks such as the 7/7 bombings			1
the @entity9 project was set up to examine ways to make tube systems more resistant to the kinds of bomb blasts which caused devastation in @entity15 and @entity16			0
after three years of research , experts at the @entity18 can now offer the rail industry advice on how to better protect passengers			1
@entity35 , from @entity37 's @entity36 , is leading the @entity39 - funded project which aims to make sure that if any such atrocities are to occur in the future , their impact is minimised			1
the research has involved looking at the evidence from previous attacks and carrying out controlled explosions on a decommissioned tube carriage			1
high speed cameras were used to slow down the blast , allowing its impact on the vehicle 's structure and interior to be analysed in detail			0
a similar test was later carried out on a prototype carriage specially built to reduce the devastating damage caused by a bomb detonating inside it			1
their findings have pointed to a number of measures which they believe rail companies could introduce immediately to reduce the damage caused by bomb blasts and flying debris			2
the pioneering research will allow experts to advise rail companies how to better protect their passengers project leader @entity74 believes tethering panels such as these could prevent dangerous shrapnel from injuring those further from a blast part of the aim of the research is to reduce casualties caused by debris - but not just in the initial blast			1
following the inquests into the deaths of the @entity15 7/7 bombings , it was revealed that medical emergency teams were hindered by debris strewn across train carriages			0
and , had the @entity94 bombers detonated their explosives while the trains were at the platform , rather than while travelling through tunnels , the death toll would have been much higher , as debris flew outwards like shrapnel			0
it is this that prompted research into energy - absorbing materials being fitted , as well as plastic coating for windows , preventing metal or glass debris from shattering outwards			1
tethering down heavy components such as ceiling panels would also reduce the amount of obstacles between rescue teams and the wounded			1
@entity35 said : ' preventing flying objects is the key			0
' tethering ceiling panels reduced the risk of fatalities and injury from flying shrapnel and also meant the gangways were kept relatively clear of debris , allowing emergency staff quick access to the injured			2
' the window coating we developed was also incredibly effective			0
without it the windows are blown outwards - putting anyone outside , such as those standing on a platform , at risk from flying glass			2
' with the plastic coating you see a clear rippling effect as the blast moves through the train but every window remains intact apart from the safety windows which are designed to be easily knocked out			2
' the @entity2 - led project aims to find ways to reduce carnage such as this from the 7/7 bombings in @entity15 engineer @entity74 said tethering ceiling panels in tube trains would reduce the risk of fatalities from flying shrapnel @entity152 workers remove debris from the wreckage of a bombed public train in @entity16 in 2004 the engineers also investigated dividing carriages with materials that soak up energy and reduce the impact of a blast wave - though in the case of the 7/7 bombing , the deceased were all travelling in the same carriage as one of the bombers			1
' the @entity16 bombings in 2004 and the 7/7 attack in @entity15 the year after highlighted how vulnerable our trains are to attack - particularly busy metro and commuter trains , ' said mr @entity35			0
' at the same time we have to be realistic			0
completely replacing existing vehicles just is n't an option			0
instead , we have developed and incorporated new technology and materials into existing carriages to improve performance			0
' what we 've shown is that companies could make some relatively cost - effective and simple modifications that would significantly improve the outcome of an attack			2
' the team is now in a position to advise rail industry chiefs on the best design approach , he said			0
he added : ' a bomb on a train is always going to be devastating but what we are trying to do is find a way in which the vehicle itself can help to mitigate the impact of an attack			2
' these are all low - cost , simple solutions that can be put on existing trains which could not only save lives but also reduce the attractiveness of our railways for potential terrorist attacks			1

experts say tethering panels , plastic windows and energy - absorbing *buffers* between carriages would reduce impact of a bomb
