@entity0 is threatening to seize property , land and businesses belonging to @entity4 if @entity5 does not agree to compensate it for the @entity8 occupation of the @entity9			1
prime minister @entity10 has demanded @entity4 pay more than £ 112billion in reparations			1
he said previous payments did not cover demands for destroyed infrastructure , compensation for war crimes and the return of a forced loan to the @entity19			0
@entity0 prime minister @entity10 , who says that @entity4 owes his country compensation worth hundreds of billions of euros due to the @entity8 occupation during the @entity9 in an emotive address to his parliament he spoke of his government pursuing its ‘ duty to history ’ and the people who ‘ fought and gave their lives to defeat @entity32 ’			1
@entity4 angrily dismissed the demands yesterday , saying it had paid reparations to @entity0			1
a spokesman for @entity4 chancellor @entity36 said the issue had been ‘ legally and politically resolved ’ at that time and during the talks which led to @entity4 reunification in 1990			2
but @entity0 politicians upped the ante with justice minister @entity42 saying he was ready to back a @entity44 ruling from 2000 allowing @entity45 to seize @entity4 - owned property to compensate the victims of a @entity8 massacre of 218 @entity0 civilians in the village of @entity51			1
the ruling about @entity4 assets can only be backed by a justice minister and his predecessors have always baulked at doing so			0
it relates to a specific atrocity in the village in which @entity8 forces went on a two - hour rampage butchering men , women and children in what they said was retaliation for an attack on them by resistance forces			0
meanwhile in @entity4 there were claims of a wider ranging plan to take @entity4 assets			0
@entity73 magazine yesterday reported that it had learned of a plan to seize @entity4 property and assets if the reparations demand was dismissed			2
however , a spokesman for @entity4 chancellor @entity36 , pictured , has said there is no reason to hold talks with @entity0 on the issue it claimed this would involve the seizure of the @entity86 , @entity4 ’s flagship cultural organisation abroad , as well as businesses and assets of @entity4 firms			2
resentment about the four - year @entity8 occupation of @entity0 in which some 250,000 people were killed , is long - standing			0
but it has been revived by the painful austerity measures imposed by the @entity95 since 2010 under the terms of the £ 175billion international rescue package			0
@entity0 media have depicted mrs @entity36 and her finance ministers in @entity8 uniforms			2
and the first act of new prime minister mr @entity10 was to lay a wreath at the site where 200 @entity0 communists were shot by the @entity19			1
mr @entity10 told parliament – during a debate on tuesday about the creation of a reparations committee – that he would not abandon @entity0 ’s ‘ irrevocable demands ’ for compensation , and that his government would ‘ work so that all of the unfulfilled obligations to @entity0 and the @entity0 people are met ’			1
@entity117 , the most left - wing government ever to be elected in @entity119 , ran for office on a platform of rejecting the austerity measures and spending their way out of crisis			0
but it has since had to back down on a number of its pledges after being forced to agree further reforms in return for extending the bailout until june			0
the @entity4 finance ministry said there would be no negotiation over the war - time debts			0
the demand comes amid a standoff between @entity45 and the @entity138 over renegotiating @entity0 debt because of the euro crisis			1

@entity0 has threatened @entity4 saying it will seize its property and land
comes as @entity45 and @entity138 reach a stand - off over negotiations on debt crisis
@entity0 prime minister says @entity4 owes his country war compensation
@entity10 adds @entity36 owes his country up to *332* billion euros
but @entity4 has dismissed the demands saying reparations have already been solved
