the amniotic sac is a bag of clear , pale fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows			1
the fluid helps to cushion the baby from bumps and injury , as well as providing it with fluids it can breathe and swallow			2
it also maintains a constant temperature for the baby			2
typically the amniotic sac breaks on its own during birth , which is commonly referred to as a mother 's ' water breaking '			1
or during a c - section , the surgeon cuts through it to deliver the baby			1
doctors say the chance of the amniotic sac remaining completely intact after birth is ' ultra rare '			1
it was a moment that mesmerised dr @entity56 , who delivered @entity2			2
' even though it sounds cliched , we caught our breath , ' he said			0
' it really felt like a moment of awe ... and one that will stick in my moment for some time			0
until the bag was broken , @entity2 was still getting oxygen through the placenta			2
doctors who delivered say the moment ' caught our breath ' ' he was seconds old and still in the water bag , with the placenta and umbilical cord tucked inside			2
' after taking a few seconds to snap the incredible sight in front of him , dr @entity56 set to work removing @entity2 out of his amniotic sac and getting him breathing			1
@entity79 's daughter @entity78 was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011 however @entity2 's mother did n't realise the excitement her son had caused until her mother showed her dr @entity56 's photo			1
' it was definitely like a clear film where you could definitely make out his head and his hair , ' she told @entity91			0
' he was kind of in a foetal position and you could see like his arms and his legs curled up			0
' it was actually really cool to see			0
and when i heard that was actually really rare i was like " oh my gosh you 're a special little baby "			2
' despite being born at just 26 weeks , @entity2 is doing so well that doctors hope he will go home within the next month			1
actress @entity79 has spoken out about her daughter @entity78 who was born inside the amniotic sac in 2011			1
she said at the time : ' the doctor had never seen anything like it before			0
he grabbed the nurse and said : ' look at this ! '			0
' i was in the middle of pushing and he told me to hold on a minute and not to push			0
' he was wearing basketball shorts and a t - shirt and said : ' oh i have to get my scrubs on for this ! ' the sac burst on its own after she came out			2
' in fact @entity79 's experience inspired @entity78 's name			0
she explained : ' when i was in recovery we still had n't chosen her name			0
[ her father @entity126 ] picked her up and said she came into the world in her ' safe haven ' and [ her name ] clicked right then for both of us			0
' the amniotic sac starts to form and fill with fluid within days of a woman conceiving			1
amniotic fluid is mainly water , but from about week 10 onwards , the baby passes small amounts of urine into the fluid			2
the amount of amniotic fluid increases gradually during pregnancy until about week 38 , when it reduces slightly until the baby is born			1
the amniotic sac is a bag of clear , pale fluid inside the womb where the unborn baby develops and grows			1
the fluid helps to cushion the baby from injury , and provides it with fluids so it can breathe and swallow being born ' en caul ' is the term used when the child is born within an intact amniotic sac , which occurred in the story above			1
it is also known as a ' veiled birth '			0
most en caul births occur in premature babies			0
statistics relating to such births are sparse , but deliveries involving any form of caul are thought to occur in roughly one in 80,000 births			1
being born ' with the caul ' , as it is known , occurs when a child is delivered with a portion of amniotic membrane on their face			2
' @entity174 ' literally means ' helmeted head ' or ' veil '			0
a baby with the caul is called the ' caulbearer '			0
being born with the caul in medieval times was interpreted as a sign of good luck and that the child was destined for greatness			0
saving the caul was considered an important tradition of childbirth			0
the midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby 's head and face , pressing the material of the caul onto the paper			0
it would then be presented to the mother , to be kept as an heirloom			0
other traditions have linked the caul to fertility and some say it protects a person from the forces of evil , such as witches and sorcerers .			0

*warning* : @entity205
@entity2 was born three months prematurely by caesarean section
doctors performing surgery astonished to see he was still in amniotic sac
this is a bag of clear , pale fluid inside womb where unborn baby develops
usually breaks when a woman goes into labour , hence ' waters breaking '
being born with sac intact is ' *extremely* rare ' - around one in 80,000 births
