by @entity1 reporter @entity3 police have used dna evidence to link two crimes carried out eight years apart and the person responsible for both offenses could still be at large			1
both crimes are more than 10 years old			0
the older of the two crimes took place in 1992 , when an 11 - year - old girl was raped and murdered			2
@entity11 was babysitting two younger children in @entity13 , @entity14 , when she was murdered			1
@entity15 , pictured left and then in his late teens , was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the murder of @entity11 , right , in 1992 the crime was very high profile at the time and the man found guilty , @entity15 , then in his late teens , was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the crime			1
despite a lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime scene , @entity15 was convicted on the strengthen of his confession which police said included details that only the killer would have known			2
@entity15 continued to maintain his innocence and despite being found guilty of the crime three times and spending nearly 20 years in prison he finally had his conviction overturned in 2012			1
one of the critical factors in his successful appeal was the 2005 dna testing that proved his semen was not the sperm found in @entity11 ’s body , reports the @entity41			2
@entity15 was released from prison in 2012 on the basis of the dna evidence , while lawyers for @entity46 have argued that he deserves a retrial based on the new evidence the two murders occurred eight years apart , but in the same area of @entity14 since his release , @entity15 has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against authorities involved in his case			1
cops have now linked dna from the semen found in @entity58 with dna obtained from a two - by - four used to brutally beat a man , @entity59 , eight years later in 2000			1
lawyers for @entity15 have said that the failure to identify and arrest @entity11 ’s real killer allowed that individual to take part in @entity59 ’s murder			1
' while mr. @entity15 fought to clear his name and officials fought to keep him in prison , the man who really committed the crime was free to commit this additional crime , ' @entity66 , one of @entity15 ’s attorneys , told the @entity41			0

according to his attorney , @entity93 , the dna match to @entity11 ’s killer adds strength to his client 's innocence claim			2
at a hearing on tuesday , @entity99 argued that @entity46 deserves a new trial based on the new evidence			2
the judge has scheduled another hearing for next week			0
despite the @entity56 matches , the identity of the potential suspect in both murders remains unknown			1
