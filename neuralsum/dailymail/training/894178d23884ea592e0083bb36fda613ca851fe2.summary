by @entity0 published : 14:20 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 14:20 est , 26 june 2013 the genome of a prehistoric horse that roamed the plains of @entity4 almost 800,000 years ago has been unveiled			1
it is about 10 times older than any dna ever recovered and comes from a fragment of the ancient animal ’s foot that had been so remarkably preserved in permafrost scientists were able to extract blood proteins			1
dating up to 780,000 years ago , the bone sheds fresh light on equine evolution and dramatically extends the known limit of dna survival			1
scientists extracted the dna from two pieces of 700,000 - year - old horse bone found in the frozen @entity20 professor @entity21 , of @entity22 , and colleagues mapped the animal ’s genes and compared them to another ancient horse from around 43,000 years ago as well as five contemporary breeds , the only surviving wild horse called a @entity29 and a donkey			1
@entity32 dna analysis techniques allowed them to sequence 73 proteins , including some found in the blood			1
the study , published in @entity37 , showed the equus lineage that gave rise to all modern - day horses , donkeys and zebras originated around four million years ago - twice the conventionally accepted time			0
the genome - or complete dna - is almost 10 times older than the previous record which was for an early human called a @entity46 that lived about 80,000 years ago			1
it shows horse populations have fluctuated multiple times over the past two million years particularly during times of severe climatic change			1
there is also evidence for continuous change in horses ’ immune system and sense of smell throughout evolution			0
and the findings support evidence @entity29 ’s horses represent the last living wild horse population and reveal genes that were probably selected during domestication			0
the piece of bone was discovered in the frozen @entity20 in @entity4 ( pictured ) the findings support evidence przewalski horses ( pictured ) are the last living wild horse population the study suggests a significant fraction of @entity6 fragments could survive for over a million years in the geosphere			1
the piece of bone was dug up a decade ago at a fossil site known as @entity78 in the @entity20			1
researchers from @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity4 , the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 all collaborated to sequence the genome			1
dna molecules can survive in fossils well after an organism dies			2
they do not survive as whole chromosomes but as short pieces that could be assembled back together , like a puzzle , the @entity97			0
the university said occasionally enough molecules survive so that the full genome sequence of an extinct species can be resurrected , such as was done with the horse			2
over the past few years , the full genome sequence of a few ancient humans , including the @entity46 genome , have been characterized.in march , scientists completed the first complete neanderthal genome sequence			1
they used only a toe bone and a tiny fragment of finger to map out the entire genetic code of @entity113 man			2
evidence suggests that the @entity113 , a little - known ancient cousin of modern humans who lived in @entity117 around 50,000 years ago , had dark skin , brown hair and brown eyes			2
prof @entity121 said : ' we first got excited when we detected the signature of amino - acids that suggested proteins had survived			0
' we got more excited when we proved able to directly sequence collagen peptides			0
' when we detected blood proteins , it really started looking promising because those are barely preserved			0
' at that stage , it could well be that ancient dna could also be preserved			1
' our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far			2
' we also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past two million years , particularly during periods of severe climatic changes			2
' we estimate the @entity29 ’s and domestic horse populations diverged 38 to 72 thousand years before present and find no evidence of recent mixture between the domestic horse breeds and the @entity29 ’s horse investigated			0
' this supports the contention @entity29 ’s horses represent the last surviving wild horse population			0
' named after a @entity150 explorer , @entity29 ’s horses are native to @entity151 and once freely roamed the steppe along the @entity81 border			0
they have since been kept and bred in captivity and have recently been reintroduced in @entity151			0
dr @entity156 , of the @entity157 , and prof @entity158 , of @entity159 in @entity160 , reviewed the study for the journal and said its implications go ' well beyond the evolution of horses			0
' dr @entity156 said : ' until this study , many experts would have thought it was impossible to recover a genome from a sample of this age because of the rapid degradation of @entity6 into ever shorter fragments that occurs following the death of an organism			2
' the decay is driven initially by the body ’s own enzymes , and the actions of enzymes from microorganisms soon follow - death shuts down the normal defences that protect an organism against such fates			0

the dna is 10 times older than any that has been previously recovered
genome dramatically extends the known limit of dna survival
