a revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year			1
laboratory tests suggest that the drug is likely to be effective in melanoma patients who no longer respond to existing treatments			2
known as a @entity8 inhibitor , the drug may also help people with a strain of cancer that can not be treated with standard drugs			1
@entity13 , or malignant skin cancer , affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the @entity17 each year			1
scientists say it is likely to be effective in patients no longer responding to existing treatments in the @entity25 , the @entity24 estimated that it killed 9,710 people in 2014			0
the cancer is triggered by short , sharp bursts of sunlight and those who have been burnt at least five times are at double the risk of the disease			0
surgery is always the first treatment option			0
but in more advanced cases patients are given drugs that suppress faulty versions of a protein called @entity41 , which fuels the growth of about half of all melanomas			1
while @entity41 inhibitors are initially very effective , the cancers generally become resistant to them within a year			2
the new drugs , which target a wider range of biological pathways in order to kill cancer cells , have been shown to halt the growth of resistant tumours			1
they also appear to work against the 20 per cent to 25 per cent of melanomas driven by a different defective protein , @entity58			0
professor @entity59 , from the @entity60 in @entity61 , who co-led a study , said : ' melanomas often respond initially to the current generation of treatments , but they inevitably acquire resistance to them , and there is a desperate need for more effective options			0
' our new inhibitors are the first in a new family of drugs that attack cancers without allowing them the get - out clause of drug resistance , by blocking multiple cancer proteins at once			1
' we are very hopeful that clinical trials from this series of new inhibitors will begin very soon - and that they will ultimately become new first or second - line options for patients who , at the moment , exhaust all the available treatments and end up with fatal disease			1
' @entity13 , or malignant skin cancer , affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the @entity17 each year			1
in the @entity25 , it killed approximately 9,710 people in 2014 her colleague , professor @entity95 , director of the @entity97 , based at the @entity98 , added : ' our laboratory study showed that these new drugs deliver multiple blows to cancer by hitting several cell survival routes at once			1
' it 's a step on from the drugs that are currently available which ca n't multitask in this way			0
' the next step is testing this family of drugs in clinical trials to establish that they are both safe and effective in cancer patients , potentially providing urgently - needed new treatments for patients who have run out of options			1
' the trial is likely to involve a small number of patients and focus mainly on safety and dosage , although it might also produce some data about the drug 's effectiveness			1
if you are unhappy with your looks , there is a greater risk of skin cancer , scientists have warned			1
a study found that people who believe they are unattractive are more likely to ‘ gamble with their skin ’s health ’ by basking in the sun. they are also less likely to use sunscreen			0
the @entity17 and @entity25 researchers say that those with low body confidence may crave a tan in the belief that the golden glow makes them look better			0
alternatively , they may simply care less about their health			0
the finding could be used to improve advertising campaigns about the danger posed by skin cancer			2
assuming the results are positive , further larger trials will look more closely at how well the drug performs			2
few details of the trial are available at this stage and the number of patients due to take part is yet to be determined			0
but professor @entity156 said funding had been agreed and an application made for ethical approval			0
she added : ' we 're all very excited and very hopeful , because it 's very important to have different therapies to offer patients who have become resistant to existing treatments			2
' patients will be given one specific drug which was chosen from hundreds of candidates after rigorous testing			2
in the laboratory study , two drugs code - named @entity172 and @entity173 were tested			2
both suppressed drug - resistant tumours from patients grown in mice without significant side - effects			1
dr @entity179 , of @entity180 , which co-funded the research together with @entity182 , said : ' malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the @entity17 , with more than 13,000 people diagnosed in 2011			0
' doctors already have frontline drugs to treat melanoma , but many patients gradually develop resistance to them and are left with few other treatment options			0
' this research , which discovered how two newly developed compounds could treat drug - resistant skin cancer , may give hope to the thousands who find themselves in this situation			1
' the study was published in the journal @entity200 .			0

drug called a @entity8 inhibitor could help advanced skin cancer patients
skin cancer patients can become resistant to standard drugs within a year
the new drugs hit several cancer cell survival routes at once
they suppress tumours without any significant side - effects
clinical trials focusing on safety and dosage will begin next year
