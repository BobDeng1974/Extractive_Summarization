patients are being denied minor treatments because they smoke , @entity0 has found			2
in one case a healthy middle - aged man was told he could not have a ten - minute operation to cut a small benign growth off the side of his head , because of his habit			1
@entity10 thought it would be no problem to get the inch - long fatty lump , called a lipoma , removed			1
patients in need of minor operations are being refused procedures by the @entity19 unless they promise to give up smoking ( library image ) it was getting caught when he put on ear defenders and hygienic headgear for his job inspecting catering equipment			0
as a result , the lump was becoming painful			0
but when he attended @entity32 in @entity33 , his gp said he could not have the minor operation – which doctors often do under local anaesthetic in their own consulting rooms			1
should @entity19 patients have to promise to quit smoking before being treated by @entity39 ? should @entity19 patients have to promise to quit smoking before being treated by @entity39 ? now share your opinion mr @entity10 , 46 , said : ‘ i was told , in no uncertain terms , that unless i gave up smoking or signed up to a quitting clinic they would refuse to treat me			1
’ he claims the doctor told him : ‘ these directions are not mine			1
it ’s not me refusing this treatment , it ’s the @entity19 trust			0
’ mr @entity10 , who smokes ten roll - ups a day , said : ‘ it makes me livid			1
i can count how many times i have needed to rely on the @entity19 in the past ten years on one hand			1
i pay into the system and it ’s my right to be able to use it when i need it			0
’ an increasing number of local health authorities are refusing smokers hip and knee replacements , unless they go on courses to quit smoking			2
@entity10 who was refused minor surgery to remove a growth , pictured , from his head because he is a smoker and obese people are also being told they must lose weight before costly joint replacement surgery , to increase the chances of success			1
in some areas , such as @entity76 and @entity77 , smokers can no longer get @entity78 on the @entity19 unless they stop			0
but this is the first time it has emerged that smokers are being turned down for minor treatments , where there is less evidence that smoking affects the outcome			0
@entity87 , of the pro-smoking campaign group @entity88 , said smokers were being targeted to cut costs			0
he added : ‘ smokers pay a huge amount of money to the state through taxation – more than £ 10 billion a year			0
that far outweighs the cost of treating smoking - related diseases , and even of treating cases such as this , which have nothing whatsoever to do with smoking			2
‘ the @entity19 should treat people equally , regardless of whether they smoke			0
if not , they run the risk of expensive court cases			0
’ yesterday , @entity105 and @entity106 appeared to climb down over mr @entity10 ’s case			1
chief executive @entity108 claimed he had not been refused surgery			0
she said the risks of smoking and surgery would be explained to him ‘ so informed consent can be obtained ’ – but that he would still receive the procedure if it was safe to do so , even if he carried on smoking			2
but mr @entity10 said : ‘ that was n’t what the doctor said to me			1
they ’ve back - pedalled big - time			2

@entity10 , 46 , needed to have a growth from the side of his removed
was told at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity123 , he could not have the procedure because he smoked ten roll - ups a day
' it *'s* my right to be able to use it when i need it , ’ mr @entity10 says
@entity105 and @entity106 climbed down over the case and said mr @entity10 will get the operation
