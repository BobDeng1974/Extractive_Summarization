she can hardly be blamed for keeping quiet since filing for divorce from @entity3 earlier this year			1
but what is perhaps surprising is how @entity5 has chosen to break her silence – by blaming the feminist revolution for giving women a ‘ sense of dread in the kitchen ’			2
the unexpected outburst was made as the food writer , 53 , gave an interview to a sunday newspaper			2
outburst : @entity5 ( pictured in a publicity photograph for her 2012 @entity18 tv show @entity19 ) has blamed the feminist revolution for giving women a ' sense of dread in the kitchen ' she said she was ‘ baffled ’ to be asked if she considers herself a feminist , adding that it should be ‘ self - evident ’ that she is			1
and despite forging a successful career based around being a ‘ domestic goddess ’ she said she recognised a reluctance among women to be ‘ tied to the stove ’			1
miss @entity5 said : ‘ feeling comfortable in the kitchen is essential for everyone , male or female			0
at the time it seemed so many people were fearful of cooking , and that meant home was never more than a stop - off from work			0
‘ women of my generation were keen - rightly - not to be tied to the stove , but the ramifications of this were that they felt a sense of dread in the kitchen			1
how can this be good for anyone ? ‘ i also feel that to denigrate any activity because it has traditionally been associated with the female sphere is in itself anti-feminist			0
’ miss @entity5 , who is filming a @entity54 version of her @entity56 cookery programme @entity57 , made her name as the author of several best - selling cookbooks , including how to be a domestic goddess , published in 2000			1
in the past she has defended the book against critics , saying it should be seen as a ‘ feminist tract ’ that celebrates women			2
ex-couple : miss @entity5 had been keeping quiet since filing for divorce from @entity3 earlier this year and as she spoke to @entity69 ’s @entity68 , in an edition to mark the nominees of its chef of the @entity73 , she addressed the issue once more			1
she said : ‘ when i wrote how to be a @entity5 , many felt i was saying that women ’s place was in the kitchen , but the ironic pictures on the end papers ( showing a @entity81 housewife ) surely undermined that , except for those people who consciously chose to misread my intent			2
’ ' women of my generation were keen - rightly - not to be tied to the stove , but the ramifications of this were that they felt a sense of dread in the kitchen			1
how can this be good for anyone ? ' @entity5 miss @entity5 ’s comments come after she returned to @entity94 from @entity95 , where she was filming for the taste			0
she is said to be looking for a property in @entity94 , after moving out of the marital home she shared with mr @entity3			1
miss @entity5 , who began her career as a journalist , also said she thinks readers can relate to her because she does n’t label herself a chef			0
she said : ‘ i am not a chef ; i am not even a trained cook			0
so yes , i do think the fact that i am a bit of a kitchen klutz , and fit cooking into an already busy life ( and i started writing food books when i was a non-food columnist with young children ) means that i cook in much the same way as my readers , or viewers			0
‘ real cooking , the sort that goes on in homes , does not have to be tricky or difficult and i felt it was important to demonstrate that			0
