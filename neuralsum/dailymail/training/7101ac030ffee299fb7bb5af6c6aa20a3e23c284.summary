@entity0 said the conservative party must ' rediscover the virtues of low taxation ' the @entity6 must ‘ rediscover the virtues of low taxation ’ and offer bigger and faster tax breaks for millions of middle - class taxpayers , a former cabinet minister says today			1
@entity0 , sacked by @entity9 in this summer ’s government reshuffle , said the threshold for the 40p higher income tax rate would now stand at more than £ 75,000 if it had risen in line with wages			1
he praised the prime minister ’s commitment last month to increase the threshold , currently £ 41,865 , to £ 50,000 by 2020 if the @entity17 win next year ’s general election , and @entity20 ’s big cuts in corporation tax			1
but in an interview with the @entity23 , he said the party should go ‘ further and faster ’ on the 40p rate , and also promise reductions in stamp duty , inheritance tax and capital gains tax			1
in a shot across the chancellor ’s bows , mr @entity0 warned that it was ‘ irresponsible and immoral ’ for @entity34 to keep borrowing at current rates – saying that despite the ‘ best efforts ’ of the @entity39 , public spending was still far too high			1
‘ the brutal fact is that over the last 40 years , no @entity34 government has ever managed to raise more than 39 per cent of national income in tax in a single year , ’ he said			1
‘ everything above that has to be borrowed			0
we inherited a big mess – in @entity49 ’s final year , borrowing stood at £ 300,000 a minute			1
' but we ’re still borrowing £ 200,000 a minute because the coalition government will be spending over £ 100billion more than it raised in this final year in office			1
‘ it ’s both irresponsible and immoral to keep borrowing at the current rate and to expect our children to pay the interest			1
we need to cut spending further and reduce borrowing			2
' the job is not even half done			0
‘ we ’re going in the right direction			0
but clearly , on tax if we want to really reward people and grow the economy we should also want to go further			2
’ mr @entity0 continued : ‘ it ’s high time we conservatives rediscovered the virtues of low taxation			2
low taxes encourage effort , initiative and enterprise			0
' people in the middle need more incentives because they are the ones who produce the wealth			0
mr @entity0 said the government should consider low taxation more seriously , adding the current rate at which @entity34 is borrowing is both ' irresponsible and immoral ' ‘ the 40p tax rate only applied to one in 20 in the late 1980s – now it ’s nearly one in six			1
had it been indexed in line with wage growth , it would cut in at over £ 75,000 a year			2
’ as well as faster action on the 40p tax rate , the former environment secretary , whose rancorous dismissal in july angered the @entity92 , also called for cuts to inheritance tax , stamp duty and capital gains tax to feature in the @entity17 election manifesto			0
stamp duty used to be levied at 1 per cent and only on the most expensive properties			0
but by 2018 , four - fifths of homes will be hit by it			0
mr @entity0 said it had been a ‘ nonsense ’ for the @entity39 to increase capital gains tax to 28 per cent – a decision which had caused a ‘ sharp reduction in the amount of income coming in ’			1
he suggested mr @entity9 should revive his commitment at the last election – scuppered by the @entity110 – to exempt everyone but millionaires from inheritance tax			0
‘ it ’s double taxation – people have already paid tax once on their earnings , ’ the mp said			0
mr @entity0 was speaking ahead of today ’s launch of his new centre - right think - tank , @entity122 , which he said would promote ‘ common - sense , small ‘ c ’ conservative ’ solutions to @entity34 ’s problems			1
he set out further proposals for cutting spending – saying there were ‘ too many chairs ’ at the @entity130 table			0
the number of government departments had only been maintained by mr @entity9 to give @entity110 ministers jobs , mr @entity0 claimed			1
‘ we should n’t shy away from getting rid of departments , ’ he said			0
‘ can we really afford the @entity137 , the @entity138 , @entity139 or @entity140 as independent departments with all the associated costs ? ’ mr @entity0 praised @entity144 ’s work to reform the welfare system			2
but he insisted more work was needed given that welfare spending is still ‘ soaking up £ 120billion a year ’			2
if pay and pensions in the public sector were brought down to the average in the private sector it would save £ 50billion a year			0
fraud in the public sector , estimated to cost as much as £ 20 billion a year , should also be reined in .			0

@entity0 said the government should promise more tax reductions
said it was ' irresponsible and immoral ' for @entity34 to borrow at current rates
country borrows ' £ 200,000 - a - minute ' by spending more than what is raised
