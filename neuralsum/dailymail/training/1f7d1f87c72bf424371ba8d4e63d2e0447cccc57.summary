by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:06 pm on 19th october 2011 revelations : @entity3 , mp for @entity4 , discovered foreign nationals who are treated medically in the @entity6 but do not pay their @entity8 bills have cost the service more than £ 40 million foreign nationals who are treated medically in the @entity6 but do not pay their @entity8 bills have cost the service more than £ 40 million , a @entity10 mp claimed today			1
@entity3 discovered 118 trusts had written off a staggering £ 42 million - and believes the total figure could be more than £ 50 million as he is still due responses from another 66 trusts			1
the mp for @entity4 , @entity18 , made the revelation in the commons as senior @entity22 mp @entity21 , chairman of the @entity23 , said all foreign nationals should sign an agreement when entering the country not to claim free treatment on the @entity8			1
health minister @entity28 said the government was aware of the problem and was looking at banning foreign nationals from re-entering the @entity6 if they had an unpaid bill for treatment on the @entity8			2
according to figures collated by mr @entity3 's office , @entity34 's and @entity36 's @entity35 in @entity37 is the worst offender			1
it has written off £ 6.2 million since 2004 and has another £ 1.8 million of outstanding debt it is still hoping to collect			1
@entity43 has written off £ 1.6 million but elsewhere in the country the figures are much lower			1
speaking outside the @entity20 , mr @entity3 said : ' in terms of the @entity8 , services are going to be stretched over the next few years and it is worth looking at who is using those services			2
' it 's a worrying trend that has increased over the last couple of years and it is one that my constituents get very angry about			1
it 's unnecessary and should n't happen			1
' mr @entity3 said a scheme in @entity57 , where foreign nationals not entitled to free health care are offered the minimum amount of treatment they need following an accident before being asked to leave hospital , should be rolled out elsewhere in the country			2
worst : @entity34 's and @entity36 's @entity35 in @entity37 has written off £ 6.2 million since 2004 and has another £ 1.8 million of outstanding debt it is still hoping to collect he added : ' this would not be a big saving but it 's the principle of knowing who is using the @entity8			1
' if you are not paying @entity6 taxes and you are not a @entity6 citizen , then there is no reason why you should have free health services			2
' it 's a national health service , not an international one			1
' under current rules , foreign nationals residing in the @entity6 and paying taxes are entitled to free treatment on the @entity8 while the bill for @entity84 citizens is sent to their home country			2
but visitors from outside the @entity84 are expected to either have health insurance or they are sent the bill			0
many leave the @entity6 after receiving treatment without paying it			0
mr @entity21 said the problem could be easily solved			0
he told the @entity20 : ' there is a relatively painless way of dealing with this			0
at the time the visa is applied for , the person coming should sign an undertaking that they will pay the costs of their treatment			0
' mr @entity28 said the government was already looking at solving the problem of foreign nationals not paying for the @entity8 for treatment they receive			0
he said the practice was an ' important issue ' for the @entity8 and the government was looking at a ' whole range of options '			0
mr @entity28 told the @entity20 : ' we have updated and simplified regulations and guidance on identifying and charging visitors who must pay			0
immigration rules which are now before parliament will allow the @entity6 @entity119 to refuse entry to visitors with an unpaid debt to the @entity8			0
' we are now reviewing this area more fundamentally to identify further improvements			0
' mr @entity3 made his discovery after submitting freedom of information requests to primary care trusts ( @entity127 ) and foundation trusts up and down the country .			0
