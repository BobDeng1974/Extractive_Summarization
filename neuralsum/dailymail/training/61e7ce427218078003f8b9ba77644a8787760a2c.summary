@entity1 clubs are edging towards a deal that would sell their tv rights collectively in a bid to end the financial dominance of @entity6 and @entity7			1
at present , @entity9 clubs sell their rights individually			1
but this has lead to a complete lack of competition with @entity7 and @entity6 each receiving around £ 120million a season			1
their nearest rivals , @entity15 , receive less than half that amount			1
but , as revealed today in @entity19 , that financial dominance is set to end as the clubs look to copy the @entity21 and sells their right together			2
@entity7 's president , @entity27 , said : ' @entity7 and @entity6 sell individually and we negotiate with a lot of success			1
' that helps us to have as many of the best players in the world as possible			0
but we know the problem : the @entity21 is very competitive			0
' you never know who will win			0
in @entity9 , between 2004 and 2014 it has been just @entity7 and @entity6 , mainly @entity7			2
transfer : selling tv rights individually has allowed @entity6 and @entity7 to pay huge fees for players poached : with so much more money , @entity7 and @entity6 have been able to poach opposition palyers initially it seems a counter-intuitive move for @entity9 's big two , but an increasingly competitive league will eventually mean more money for them			1
and , in the mean time , they will not lose any money			0
@entity27 said : ' we are leading the attempt to find a consensus			0
it has been our objective for a long time to convince all the clubs in @entity1 to sell the rights as a competition			2
' not all of them have been helpful			0
we will make the same , but the ( revenue ) increase will go to the other clubs			0
' achievement : considering the financial disparity , @entity15 's title victory deserves enormous credit @entity76 ' we can win every game ' @entity79 boss claims			2

@entity1 clubs have been selling tv rights individually
@entity7 and @entity6 each receive around £ 120m per season
@entity15 earn less than half that
new deal would see the rights sold collectively , like the @entity21
@entity90 , @entity7 's president , has been a main advocate
