@entity1 playmaker @entity0 believes @entity3 's development would be best served if he stayed in @entity4 , where he could have a team built around him			1
and the ageless @entity6 says @entity3 could even win the @entity7 if he stays in @entity4			2
aged 21 , @entity3 has no shortage of suitors , and the @entity10 international is only going to get better			0
the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have all expressed an interest in signing the @entity10 , undeterred by @entity1 's £ 80 million asking price			1
@entity3 is regarded as one of world football 's best young talents and is wanted by a host of elite clubs however , @entity1 team - mate @entity0 ( right ) insists @entity3 should resist any offers to leave @entity25 @entity0 says that @entity3 is the ' future of @entity1 ' and could win the @entity7 if he remains in @entity4 ' that prize ( the @entity7 ) will always go to a player who scores , one who makes the difference , ' @entity0 told @entity32			1
' @entity33 ( 2007 ) did that in his day , the way that @entity35 ( @entity35 ) and ( @entity36 ) @entity36 are doing it now			0
' @entity3 could be the future of @entity1			2
he has it all : physique , technique and an eye for the goal			0
he can mark an era			0
' @entity0 has compared @entity3 's influence on the @entity1 team to that of 2007 @entity7 winner @entity33 's at @entity47 @entity3 has scored seven goals and made three assists in 26 games for @entity1 so far this season @entity3 joined @entity1 from @entity16 in 2012 on a free transfer after failing to agree a new contract at @entity53			1
after failing to replace @entity55 , both @entity56 and former boss @entity57 have both lamented @entity16 's lack of a ' complete ' midfielder			0
and if @entity16 were to re-sign @entity3 for £ 80m after letting him leave for nothing , it would open up the club to ridicule			1
but given the player 's growing talent , a deal could be on the cards			0
@entity3 is in a position to pick whichever club he likes , but leaving a @entity1 side that is dominating @entity25 and is committed to making him their star man would be no easy task			2
@entity3 left @entity16 in 2012 after failing to agree a new contract with the club @entity16 manager @entity56 has made no secret of his desire to sign a ' complete ' midfielder			1

@entity3 is one of the most *sought* after talents in world football
the midfielder has been in *superb* form for @entity1 this season
@entity0 says @entity3 can *achieve* any *ambitions* he has in @entity4
@entity3 signed for @entity1 from @entity16 in 2012
