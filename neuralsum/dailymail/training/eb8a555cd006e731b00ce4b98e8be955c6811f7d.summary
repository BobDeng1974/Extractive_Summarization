by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor two members of @entity3 got into a shouting match thursday over whether the error - plagued @entity5 @entity1 give up their privacy rights when they apply for health insurance through the federal government			1
rep. @entity9 of @entity10 unleashed a round of verbal @entity12 during a @entity14 hearing after @entity15			2
@entity16 of @entity17 and @entity18 of @entity19 accused software contractors of violating the @entity21 , known as @entity21 , by collecting @entity1 ' personal information from @entity23			1
and one company official testified to the @entity25 that 2,000 employees have access to the information @entity1 give the @entity5 website when they apply for insurance			1
' that 's not in play here today			2
no health information is required in the application process			2
and why is that ? because pre-existing conditions do n't matter			0
' ' so once again here we have my @entity51 colleagues trying to scare everybody			0
' ' will the gentleman yield ? ' rep. @entity16 interrupted			0
' no , i will not yield to this monkey court or whatever this thing is ! ' @entity9 yelled			0
' this is not a monkey court , ' @entity16 countered			0
' do whatever you want ! ' @entity9 added			0
' i am not yielding			0
' @entity9 acknowledged that @entity5 applicants are ' asked about your address , your date of birth , ' but insisted that no one is asked to share ' health information			1
' and according to the @entity69 , sharing even those kinds of data can violate @entity21 if it 's within the context of a medical insurance transaction			1
witnesses in thursday 's hearing included ( @entity76 ) senior vp of @entity79 @entity78 , group executive vice president for @entity80 , corporate counsel for @entity82 , and program director for @entity85 @entity84 rep. @entity18 dug into privacy issues , forcing one corporate official to concede that 2,000 of his employees have access to private consumer data @entity21 , passed in 1996 , forbids doctors , hospitals , health care clearinghouses and health insurers – and their ' business associates ' – from disclosing ' individually identifiable health information ' related to anyone 's medical records			1
@entity100 rep. @entity99 mocked the companies behind the crash - prone @entity5 website for blaming an unexpected traffic volume for their problems : ' @entity107 and @entity108 do n't crash the week before @entity109			1
and @entity110 does n't crash on @entity111 ' information covered under the law , according to the @entity1 @entity69 , ' includes many common identifiers ( e.g. , name , address , birth date , @entity118 )			1
' @entity84 , a program director at @entity85 – a company that helps the federal government determine if @entity5 applicants meet eligibility requirements – testified that ' 2,000 people ' in his company have access to their applications , and that the information was retained for 30 days			1
' you know , ' countered rep. @entity129 , ' under @entity21 regs , no one 's supposed to have access to that database			2
' @entity82 attorney @entity134 , whose company has been contracted to verify the income levels of @entity5 applicants who claim subsidies to pay for their insurance , described the kind of information that is changing hands			1
' we are provided only with limited information : @entity118 numbers , names and date of birth , which we use to match against our system , ' she said			1
@entity16 first raised the privacy issue with a visual aid showing part of the @entity23 ' source code , ' the computer language that generates the web page consumers see			2
' you have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system , ' the text reads			2
' at any time , and for any lawful @entity165 purpose , the government may monitor , intercept , and search and seize any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system			1
any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system may be disclosed or used for any lawful @entity165 purpose			1
' @entity85 program director @entity84 ( r ) testified that 2,000 of his company 's employees have access to consumers ' information collected by the @entity5 website democrats on the panel claimed that since the text was buried in a part of the website 's code that consumers ca n't see , it was meaningless			1
but @entity78 , senior vice president of @entity79 , the main contractor for @entity23 , testified that ' yes , ' she was aware it was part of the website , and that the @entity191 , @entity191 , made the decision to keep it hidden			2
senior vice president of @entity79 @entity78 came under fire as the chief developer behind @entity23 ' you were aware , ' @entity16 continued			0
' okay , do you think that 's @entity21 compliant ? how can that be ? you know it 's not @entity21 compliant ! admit it – you 're under oath ! ' ' that is @entity191 's decision to make , ' @entity78 shot back , ' what is public or not			2
' @entity78 also accused @entity191 of botching the @entity5 website 's pre-launch testing , saying that the government agency was solely responsible for testing @entity23 once all the various contractors delivered their individual pieces of the project ' @entity191 did the end - to - end testing , ' she said , while acknowledging that the final result has produced unacceptable results			1
@entity216 rep. @entity99 was n't impressed			0
' this is the 21st century			0
' there are thousands of websites that handle concurrent volumes far larger than what @entity23 was faced with			0
' @entity99 represents @entity100 's @entity225 region			0
' you keep speaking about unexpected volumes , ms. @entity78 , and that really sticks in my craw			0
... i think that 's really kind of a lame excuse			0
@entity107 and @entity108 do n't crash the week before @entity109			0
and @entity110 does n't crash on @entity111			0

verbal *sparring* *erupted* over whether @entity5 website *vendors* violated medical privacy laws by collecting personal information from applicants
one @entity240 on the panel insisted that since no medical *histories* were required to apply , there was no violation of the ' @entity21 ' law
the @entity248 's own website *declares* that every @entity1 's ' name , address , birth date , @entity118 ' must be *protected*
a company chief testified that 2,000 of his employees have access to such information submitted with @entity5 insurance applications
hidden text in the ' source code ' of the @entity5 website says users are *waiving* their privacy rights , and that their personal data ' may be disclosed or used for any lawful @entity165 purpose '
