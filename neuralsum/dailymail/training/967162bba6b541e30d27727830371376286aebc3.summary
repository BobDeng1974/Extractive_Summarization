by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has been hit with a five - place grid penalty after @entity4 were forced to change his gearbox			1
it means the world champion will start 15th for tomorrow 's @entity8 after losing drive at the start of the final qualifying session , forcing him to pull his ailing @entity4 over to the side of turn three at @entity14 's @entity14			1
it was another kick in the teeth for the reigning four - times world champion after missing virtually all of friday 's practice sessions due to his car incurring a wiring loom fault			2
blow : @entity2 has been hit with a five - place penalty after @entity4 were forced to change his gearbox asked whether this weekend was a test of his mettle as a driver , @entity2 replied : ' well , i have n't been tested on the track much so far because i have n't driven much			1
' it is tough because you would obviously love to get more info about the car , get into a rhythm			2
' after missing near enough both practice sessions , i caught up a little in final practice , but then qualifying was tricky			2
' in q3 i left the pits , tried to go up to second ( gear ) , but lost drive			0
' i tried third , had third , so i decided to keep going because it is possible to do a lap around here even without second gear			0
off track : @entity2 stopped on track for the second successive day with a gearbox issue ' but by turn one i was stuck in fifth gear and could n't go up or down , i had lost all drive , so had to stop			1
' these things happen , but now i just have to do the best i can from the position i am in			0
' @entity2 added : ' with all these reliability issues it 's a bit disappointing , and now a bit boring			1
we 've had all sorts of problems this year			0
' in practice , unfortunately a very small cable got caught in the wrong place which was impossible to see in putting the car together , but obviously now we know where it belongs			0
' up to that stage you could say we 've been lucky because we 've never been caught			0
' as for today i do n't know yet what was the cause			0
i hope there was no damage to the gearbox otherwise that would mean another penalty for tomorrow			1
