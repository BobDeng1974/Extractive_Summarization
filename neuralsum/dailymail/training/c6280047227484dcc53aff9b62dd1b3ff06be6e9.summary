@entity1 lose in @entity2 on tuesday night - only to discover @entity3 have beaten @entity4			1
would @entity5 regret only bringing 11 first - teamers to @entity7 with him then ? that , of course , is the worst case scenario facing the @entity12 manager as he prepares his side for their final @entity15 group clash against @entity16			1
@entity17 and @entity5 speak to the press after arriving in @entity2 on monday @entity5 gives out instructions to his players during a training session at @entity22 on monday morning there is logic behind the @entity26 's decision - but you wonder if the decision will come back to haunt him			1
it 's true to say finishing top of @entity32 looks a far - fetched dream , but it looks a dream that @entity5 has totally given up on			1
which is strange given @entity5 , a man who know his stats , understands the perils of finishing second in a @entity15 group			2
over the last 10 years under 29 per cent of teams that finished in the runners - up spot in their respective pool went on to progress to the next round of the knockout phase			0
that stat will sound awfully familiar to @entity5 and his side			2
having finished second in their group last season , they crashed out in the first knockout round against @entity54			0
twelve months earlier , they fell at the same hurdle , again to the @entity58 giants			0
@entity1 manager @entity5 answers questions at a pre-match press conference in @entity2 on monday history repeated itself in 2011 when - having finished second in a group that included @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 - they lost to @entity67 in the last 16			1
@entity5 , with that in mind , will be keeping his fingers crossed his side avoid one of @entity74 's superpowers in the next round of the tournament			2
the @entity26 has gone with the odds			0
to a point , it 's understandable			0
but imagine how he 'd feel if the unthinkable happens and @entity4 do suffer a shock defeat against @entity3			2
@entity1 players as they were knocked out of the @entity15 last 16 by @entity54 last season more importantly , imagine how the supporters will feel			2
@entity5 will have a bench full of unproven youngsters to turn to should it emerge finishing top is on			1
' being top would be nice , ' admitted @entity17			0
' @entity91 is is not fully in our hands			0
we are here to win the game and that is what we will be trying to do			0
' first of all , they ( the youngsters who have travelled ) are all boys who play for @entity1 , which warrants definite respect straight away			0
@entity17 ( left ) runs as @entity1 hold a training session at @entity22 on monday morning @entity102 ( left ) and @entity103 ( right ) sit in a buggy steered by @entity1 physio @entity105 ' for all young players , you have to start somewhere , and you have to be challenged at some point , the young lads who are in the squad if they have the chance that is their chance to prove their point and prove they are capable , ' from what i have seen of them , they all have good quality , they are all good lads , up for it and prove to boss that they are good players			1
' the boys that have been here before , the more experienced players in the team , it is their responsibility to help the young ones get through the game and cope with it			0
' there will definitely be nerves , but the lads that have played for a long time still get nervous , that is normal for them to feel nervous			0
' they have just got to go out there if they do play and do what they do week in week out that has got them to this position			0
' the vibes towards @entity5 from a section of the club 's supporters are n't great at the moment - the uncomfortable scenes at @entity148 train station on saturday , when the @entity26 was abused and heckled by his own fans , are testament to that			2
@entity5 is heckled as he catches a train at @entity148 on saturday after the @entity153 defeat @entity1 players show their frustrations after conceding a third goal to @entity157 at the @entity158 should the unthinkable happen on tuesday night then it could turn nasty again			1
@entity5 knows the consequences should things turn out for the worse			0
he 'll be labelled a fool if @entity3 defeat @entity4 only for @entity1 not to keep their end of the bargain			1
however , what would @entity5 be labelled as if @entity3 did n't win and @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 or @entity170 - the four players who are n't carrying injuries but were told to stay in @entity22 - were to pick up an injury ? foolish , right ? particularly when your chances of finishing top of the group were minor			1
@entity179 posted this picture on @entity181 of he and @entity103 on the flight to @entity2 on monday @entity168 ( centre ) and @entity169 ( right ) take part in training on monday but did not travel to @entity7 @entity5 , in that sense , is between a rock and a hard place			1
does he go for broke - or risk adding to his already lengthy injury list with the busy festive period upon us ? in reality , the team @entity5 will play on tuesday ( @entity194 ; @entity195 , @entity103 , @entity196 , @entity197 ; @entity198 , @entity17 , @entity102 ; @entity199 , @entity179 ; @entity200 ) is more than capable of winning at @entity16			1
their true crime was letting that three - goal lead slip against @entity3			2
so let 's reserve judgement on @entity5 's latest call until after tuesday 's clash			1
