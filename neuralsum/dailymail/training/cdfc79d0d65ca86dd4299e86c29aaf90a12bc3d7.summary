it is an iconic sight , a steam bus that shuttles more than 50,000 tourists a year through the steep , narrow streets of @entity4			1
and now you can own a slice of history by bidding for the @entity8 the @entity9 on @entity10			2
the 11 - tonne bus is on sale for £ 185,000 and has long been a familiar sight in the picturesque @entity15 seaside town , trundling along at a maximum speed of 25mph			1
iconic seaside attraction , @entity8 the @entity9 , is now up for sale on @entity10 for £ 185,000 but now owners @entity19 and @entity21 have decided to reluctantly part with the unique steam bus , after a row with the local council			1
despite being labelled a heritage attraction and a national treasure , @entity8 , the only working steam bus in the world , receives no money from the public purse			2
for nine years the couple have operated @entity8 , a six - wheel , 30 - seater bus , and a sister vehicle , a soft top charabanc , called @entity36 , which was built in 1929			2
but with the owners decision to part company , locals fear that the attraction could be sold overseas and leave the town forever			0
@entity19 and @entity21 decided to put it up for sale following a dispute with the local council the bus is a local institution , shuttling over 50,000 holidaymakers every year at a maximum speed of 25mph owner @entity21 reluctantly announced the sale of the ' heritage attraction ' on @entity52 announcing the sale on @entity52 the couple said : ' we are a heritage attraction , but unlike most others we get nothing from the public purse , in spite of being labelled a national treasure			1
' we have reached the stage where in spite of all the good you and other people do by taking a ride , the ever growing costs of keeping our old ladies going are getting beyond us			0
' the couple had a dispute earlier in the year over the ' obstructive ' attitude of the council over the refilling of @entity8 's 300 gallon water @entity76 steam bus must be refilled once each day , a process that takes five minutes			1
the refilling usually took place at @entity82 's ground , but the bus can not be accommodated on the 12 days a year when a match was being held			0
the couple also shared that they get ' nothing from the public purse ' to help with maintenance of the vehicle for the lucky bidder , a 10 % non-refundable deposit must be paid within 24 hours of the end of the auction @entity21 claimed he contacted the council to ask whether this could take place at a car park near the town 's harbour - but said the council refused permission , saying the vehicle must fit inside a designated parking space			2
mr @entity21 said : ' there are a variety of reasons for selling @entity8 but the council 's behaviour is a catalyst			0
' we think it 's time the council wakes up the level of public support , instead of being what we perceive as obstructive			0
' the decision to sell came after the pair contacted the council about concerns refilling the vehicle 's water tank @entity19 and @entity21 had hoped to refill the vehicle 12 days per year in a local harbour - side car park a spokeswoman for @entity126 has said : ' like many others , we are very sad to hear of the decision taken by the owners of @entity8 to stop operating in @entity4			1
' as one of the town 's unique and much loved attractions we fully appreciate the strength of feelings expressed by her supporters			0
' however , we strongly refute the claims that we are somehow to blame for the owner 's decision			0
however , the council refused their request , which @entity141 identifies as his ' catalyst ' to opt to sell locals are hopeful that the attraction will remain in the town and not be sold to an individual overseas ' welcome to @entity15 has worked closely with @entity8 's owners for a number of years to try and assist them , which included helping to fund @entity8 's participation in two lord mayor 's parades in @entity152			1
' in conclusion , we feel that the willingness of the council and welcome to @entity15 in recent years to support the steam bus has unfortunately not been met with realistic co-operation from its owners			1
' @entity8 will continue carry passengers this year before making her final journey on november 2 .			0
