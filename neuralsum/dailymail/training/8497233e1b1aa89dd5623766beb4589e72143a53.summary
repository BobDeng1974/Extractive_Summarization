by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:47 am on 25th july 2011 with the space shuttle now history , @entity3 's next great mission is so audacious , the agency 's best minds are wrestling with how to pull it off			1
they have presidential orders to to send astronauts to an asteroid in less than 15 years			2
the challenges are innumerable , but many @entity3 brains are thrilled to have such an improbable assignment - and believe civilisation may even depend on it			1
the asteroid @entity19 , as photographed by the orbiting @entity20 on july 17			0
@entity3 now aims to place astronauts on an asteroid within 15 years an asteroid is a giant space rock that orbits the sun , like @entity26			1
and someday one might threaten the planet			0
but sending people to one wo n't be easy			0
you ca n't land on an asteroid because you 'd bounce off - it has virtually no gravity			0
astronauts could n't even walk on it because they 'd float away			0
reaching it might require a @entity3 spacecraft to harpoon it			1
@entity3 is thinking about jetpacks , tethers , bungees , nets and spiderwebs to allow explorers to float just above the surface of it while attached to a smaller mini-spaceship			2
such a ship - something like a @entity48 shuttle craft melded with a deep sea explorer with pincer - like arms - is needed just to get within working distance of the rock			0
that craft would have to be big enough for astronauts to live in for a week or two			0
they 'd still need a larger habitat for the long term			0
@entity3 has also announced details of plans to determine if @entity60 has or ever had the ingredients for life			1
a robotic science laboratory , being prepared for a november 25 launch , will land in august 2012 near a mountain in a crater on the planet most like @entity26 in the solar system			1
touchdown point : @entity3 's rover will land at @entity60 ' @entity72 crater in august 2012 the announcement came after the final curtain fell on @entity3 's 30 - year - old space shuttle programme with thursday 's landing of @entity77 at the @entity78			1
a detailed blueprint of @entity3 's follow - on space exploration strategy is still pending and many @entity81 fear the demise of the shuttle program means the @entity81 is relinquishing its leadership in space			1
but president @entity86 has said the objective is to build new spaceships that can travel beyond the shuttle 's near - @entity26 orbit and eventually send astronauts to asteroids , @entity60 and other destinations in deep space			1
at a @entity97 briefing on wednesday , @entity3 officials will discuss preparations for the agency 's upcoming @entity100 mission to @entity102			1
the unmanned spacecraft , set for launch in august , is expected to reach @entity102 's orbit in july 2016 and should further understanding of the solar system 's beginnings by revealing the origin and evolution of its largest planet			1
among the most sophisticated probes in the offing , the plutonium - powered roving @entity113 , nicknamed @entity115 , is being prepared for launch in november			0
twice as long and five times heavier than previous @entity60 rovers , @entity115 packs ten science instruments , including two for on - site chemical analysis of pulverized rock			1
with it , scientists hope to learn if @entity60 has or ever had the organics necessary for life - at least life as it appears on @entity26			1
scientists spent five years mulling 60 possible landing sites before narrowing the list to four : @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and - the winner - @entity72 , which sports a stunning three mile - high mountain of rocks rising from the crater floor			0
that 's about twice the height of the stack of rocks exposed in the @entity142			0
analysis from @entity60 - orbiting spacecraft shows the base of @entity72 's mountain includes both clays and sulphate salts , the only site among the four finalists with both types of materials available			1
scientists do not know how the mountain formed , but it may be the eroded remnant of sediment that once completely filled the crater			0
though @entity115 's mission is scheduled to last two years , scientists hope the rover will live past its warranty			1
one of a pair of @entity60 rovers that arrived for concurrent three - month surveys in january 2004 is still working			2
its twin succumbed to the harsh @entity60 environment only last year			2
they returned evidence that @entity60 was once far wetter and warmer than the dry , cold desert that exists today			2
it would take half a year to reach an asteroid , based on current possible targets			2
the deep space propulsion system to fly such a distance is n't perfected yet			0
football field - sized solar panels would help , meaning the entire mothership complex would be fairly large			0
it would have to protect the space travellers from killer solar and cosmic ray bursts			0
and , they would need a crew capsule , maybe two , for travelling between the asteroid complex and @entity26			1
and all those parts - mini-spaceship , habitat / living area , crew capsule , solar arrays and propulsion system - would have to be linked together in the middle of space , assembled in a way like the @entity196 but on a smaller scale			0
beyond all those obstacles , @entity3 does n't even know which asteroid would be the best place to visit			1
all this has to be ready to launch by 2025 by presidential order			0
@entity202 , chief architect of the human exploration team at @entity204 , said : ' this is the big step this is out into the universe , away from @entity26 's gravity completely ... this is really where you are doing the @entity48 kind of thing			1
' it has the dreamers of @entity3 both excited and anxious			2
@entity212 , @entity3 chief technology officer , said : ' this is a risky mission			1
it 's a challenging mission			2
it 's the kind of mission that engineers will eat up			2
' this is a matter of sending ' humans farther than ever before ' , said @entity3 deputy administrator @entity220			2
it is all a stepping stone to the dream of flying astronauts to @entity60 in the mid- 2030s			1
' i think it is the mission @entity3 should embrace , ' said @entity227 aerospace professor @entity226			1
' to be successful at this mission , you 've got to embrace all of the technologies that you need for @entity60			1
' critics , including former @entity233 astronauts and flight directors , have blasted president @entity86 for cancelling @entity236 's plan to return astronauts to the moon			2
they dismiss talk of asteroid visits			0
but that 's because @entity3 has not done a good job of outlining the fascinating details and explaining why it is important , said astronomer and former astronaut @entity245			1
' @entity3 does n't have a story right now , ' said mr @entity245 , deputy director at the @entity248			2
' exploration is nothing if not the articulation of a great story			0
' the story begins with why @entity3 would want to go to an asteroid			1
the agency has sent small spacecraft off to study asteroids over the years and even landed on one in 2001			0
just last week , a space probe began orbiting a huge asteroid called @entity19 , which lies beyond @entity60			1
scientifically , an asteroid is a remnant from the birth of the solar system , offering clues about how our planetary system began			0
logistically , @entity3 wants to go to @entity60 , but that is distant and more difficult			1
so the argument is that going to an asteroid is a better testing ground than returning to the moon			0
the reason @entity3 administrator @entity272 and others give is that this mission could save civilisation			1
every 100million years or so an asteroid six - miles wide - the type that killed off the dinosaurs - smacks @entity26 , said @entity279 program manager @entity278			1
if @entity3 can get astronauts to an asteroid , they can figure out a way of changing a potential killer 's orbit			1
they 'll experiment with the safe one they land on , mr @entity212 said			0
getting to an asteroid will be tough - huge powerful rockets are needed to launch spacecraft and parts out of @entity26 orbit			1
@entity3 promises to announce its design idea for these rockets by the end of the summer and @entity296 has ordered that they be built by 2016			2
it will take two or three or maybe even more launches of these unnamed rockets to get all the needed parts into space			0
an anaglyph image of the south polar region of @entity19 put together from two clear filter images taken on july 9 by the framing camera instrument aboard @entity20			0
@entity3 officials have yet to decide which asteroid to land on the crew capsule is the farthest along - with $ 5billion already spent - because @entity3 is using the @entity309 crew ship it was already designing for the now dead moon mission and repurposing it for deep space			1
once in space , the ship needs a propulsion system to get it to the asteroid			2
one way is to use traditional chemical propulsion , but that would require carrying lots of hard - to - store fuel and creation of a new storage system , mr @entity202 said			0
another way is to use ion propulsion , which is efficient and requires less fuel , but it is enormously slow to rev up and gain speed			0
it would also require an electrical ignition source , thus the giant solar power wings			0
if @entity3 goes to ion propulsion , the best bet would be to start the bulk of the ship on a trip to and around the moon without astronauts			1
that would take a while , but if no one is on it , it does n't matter , mr @entity202 said			0
distant journey : an artist 's impression of the ion - drive propelled space probe @entity20 arriving in the asteroid belt then when that ship is far from @entity26 , astronauts aboard @entity309 would dock and join the rest of the trip			1
by this time , the ship would have picked up sufficient speed and keep on accelerating			0
@entity309 is n't big enough for four astronauts to live on for a year			0
they would need a larger space habitat , a place where they can exercise to keep from losing bone strength in zero gravity			0
they would need a place to store food , sleep and most importantly a storm shelter to protect them from potentially deadly and radiation - loaded solar flares			0
much of the habitat could be inflatable , launched in a lightweight form , and inflated in space			2
on friday , @entity3 announced a competition among four universities to design potential exploration habitats			2
meanwhile @entity3 is pursuing its concept for a mini-spaceship exploration vehicle , about the size of a minivan			0
and it 's planning an underwater lab for training , an effort to mimic an asteroid mission 's challenges			1
end of an era : @entity77 and her crew were welcomed back as heroes on thursday after landing at @entity78 and bringing @entity3 's shuttle programme to a close			2

it will take a spacecraft six months to reach an asteroid
@entity3 yet to decide which space rock would be the best to visit
scientists believe civilisation on @entity26 may depend on mission 's success
mission is a stepping stone to the dream of flying astronauts to @entity60
