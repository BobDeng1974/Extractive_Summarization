a tiny village is believed to be home to @entity3 ’s oldest tree - a yew that first took took root more than 5,000 years ago			1
the majestic yew that lives in in a @entity8 churchyard was 3,000 years old when @entity9 was born , according to tree ageing experts			1
experts have run tests on the tree in the @entity15 ’s churchyard at @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity18 , including dna and ring - dating			1
@entity21 - inspiring : the ancient yew ( pictured ) in a @entity8 churchyard has standing since more than 3,000 years before @entity9 according to tree ageing experts the process of ageing a tree is called dendrochronology			1
there are now many different methods used - from physically measuring the circumference of a a tree 's trunk , to tree - ring measuring to dna testing			1
trees rings are a result of new growth during the year , so the number of rings directly corresponds with the number of years a tree has been alive			2
however , different species of tree have different growth rates			2
there are hundreds of ancient yew trees dating back at least 600 years across @entity3 , but the 60 - foot - wide giant at @entity15 ’s is believed to be the most ancient			1
tree ageing expert @entity49 , 64 , who has studied yews for more than 40 years , said : ' i ’m convinced this is the oldest tree in @entity54			2
' it was planted on the north side of the ancient burial mound which is now the churchyard , probably in honour of a neolithic chieftain			2
' it is so old that it has split into two halves - one 40ft ( 12 metres ) wide and the other 20 ft ( 6 metres ) wide			0
' its dna has been tested by the @entity65 and its ring count is 120 per inch which makes it [ more than ] 5,000 years old			1
' there are hundreds of ancient yew trees across @entity3 , but the 60 - foot - wide giant ( pictured with church vicar @entity71 ) at @entity15 's is believed to be the most ancient of them all the yew tree is a poisonous species of conifer native to @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity54 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
the trees usually live between 400 and 600 years , although some live a great deal longer - such as in the case of the recently analysed @entity8 yew			1
one reason for the plant 's longevity is that it is able to split under the weight of very old growth without falling victim to disease in the fracture , as most other trees do			2
another reason is its ability to give grow new shoots , even in old age			0
all across the @entity102 world , the yew tree had incredible cultural significance			2
many pagan religions believed the trees were sacred because they were evergreen - symbolising eternal life - and fallen branches could easily regenerate and take root in nearby soil			0
a number of pagan cultures across @entity54 believed that the yew tree could help ancient priests or druids summon spirits and connect with the @entity116			1
the trees were also thought to posses magical powers because , on hot days , they release a gas called taxine that has the ability to cause hallucinations			0
trees and plants were incredibly important in ancient pagan cultures			0
here an illustration depicts druids performing a ritual with mistletoe , a plant which was thought to possess protective qualities yews were potent symbols of death too - particularly in ancient @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 - because of their toxic leaves and red berries			1
the yew is found in churchyards across @entity54 because the early @entity142 often took over existing religious buildings as it converted and took over pagan regions			0
but the tree has since become a strong @entity147 symbol - its long life and evergreen leaves now represent @entity9 's transcendence of death in his resurrection			1
the yew 's leaves also bear a resemblance to palm leaves and were commonly used on @entity157 for @entity159 rituals			2
indeed some ancient @entity3 folklore has even hinted that @entity9 was crucified on a yew tree - lyrics such as another , less magical reason for their existence in churchyards is that poisonous yews were actively planted by the local parish to discourage farmers from letting their cattle graze on burial grounds			1
source : various the tree previously thought to be @entity54 ’s oldest yew is in a cemetary in the village of @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178			1
modern expert estimates have put its age at up to 5,000 years old			0
@entity142 property services chief @entity182 said : ' @entity184 trees have survived in @entity142 better than anywhere else because of our wet climate and lower light levels			0
' it is believed that the yew ( recording - breaking specimen pictured ) is found in churchyards across @entity54 because the early @entity142 took over existing religious buildings as it converted and took over pagan regions the @entity142 has now launched a campaign to protect the yew trees in their churchyards			0
it is sending out certificates to parishes and communities which have some of the oldest yews - giving information on where to get the best advice for managing and making the most of them			0
mr @entity182 said : ' it is time we celebrated these amazing trees and the communities that have cared for them down the centuries			0
' the world 's oldest tree lives on a mountain in central @entity215 – and it is still growing			2
the 9,500 - year - old @entity216 ( pictured , right ) was discovered by scientists at @entity218 during a 2004 tree census in @entity220 in @entity215			0
the age of the tree was established using carbon - 14 dating at a laboratory in @entity225 , @entity226 after an investigation by the university			0
it has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation , which means it is able to effectively clone itself			0
while the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new , its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years .			0

the ancient yew lives in a @entity8 churchyard and is thought to have been standing more than 3,000 years before @entity9 was born
experts have run tests on the tree in the @entity15 ’s churchyard at @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity18 , including dna and ring dating
the species is common across @entity251 churchyards because its evergreen leaves and longevity is a symbol of @entity9 's transcendence of death
