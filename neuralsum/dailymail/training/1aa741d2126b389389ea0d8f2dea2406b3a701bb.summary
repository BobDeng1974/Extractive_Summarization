@entity0 held on to beat @entity2 champions @entity1 in a thrilling contest at @entity4 on saturday afternoon			1
the @entity0 are unlikely occupiers of a top - four place in the @entity2 , and further strengthened their position with a hard - fought 2 - 1 victory over @entity9 's side			1
@entity10 and @entity11 put the home side two goals to the good before @entity14 set up a frantic finale with a superb finish into the corner			1
here , @entity19 's @entity18 gives his verdict on how the players performed			0
@entity0 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity22 - 7 what a save to deny @entity24 in the second half after the striker had wriggled free and another in the opening period when the ball ricocheted off the @entity1 man and he reacted quickly			1
@entity22 making one of his many saves , which helped @entity0 hold on for an invaluable three points @entity34 - 6.5 got forward regularly down the right flank and was composed at the back			1
an all - round solid performance			2
@entity38 - 7 sensational block to keep out @entity24 's follow - up effort in the second half			2
a potentially very difficult afternoon well dealt with			0
@entity42 - 6.5 solid at the back , but not always on top of @entity24 and @entity14 , who broke through in patches , particularly in the second half			1
@entity47 - 7.5 another consummate display from the full - back , who is taking to life at @entity0 well			1
great cross to set up the second			0
@entity54 impressed for @entity0 , and was their star man against @entity1 @entity54 , with @entity38 ( right ) , take the applause of the @entity0 faithful after the match @entity54 - 8 yet another commanding display from the centre of the park			1
his through ball to play in @entity63 to set up @entity0 's first could not have been better weighted			1
@entity64 - 7 tireless running and tackling all game			2
he just does not stop haring around the pitch			0
a real asset to his team			0
@entity10 - 7 left with a tap - in for @entity0 's opener and made life difficult for @entity1 's defence with his runs from midfield			1
@entity10 scored to put @entity0 1 - 0 up at @entity4 on saturday afternoon @entity10 scored his second goal of the season - his first was against @entity80 at @entity4 @entity81 - 5.5 sent a free header over the bar in the first half which would 've put them two goals ahead			1
@entity63 - 7 his run to set up the first was immense – such a burst of pace it took him flying into the home fans			2
@entity11 - 7.5 strong and powerful up front , he ran @entity1 's back line ragged all afternoon – winning headers and holding up the ball			1
manager : @entity98 - 8.5 @entity11 scored to double @entity0 's lead with 15 minutes to go in the match @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity101 - 7 had a busier afternoon than he was possibly expecting			1
the save from @entity104 at point - blank range was brave and crucial – and required treatment when he took a knock afterwards			2
@entity109 - 5 tried his best on @entity1 's right flank to get forward and support the attack , but it occasionally left them vulnerable on the break			0
@entity114 - 4.5 struggled to deal with the pace and power of @entity104 and @entity11 , but his afternoon was made more difficult alongside @entity117			1
@entity117 - 3 shocking performance from the £ 32million man			0
mis - hit clearances , being tackled by opposition forwards and always looking vulnerable			0
@entity117 ( left ) struggled to deal with @entity0 's forwards - he is pictured losing out to @entity123 @entity124 - 5 not a glistening performance , by any stretch of the imagination , and looked tired on the left			2
@entity129 his best performance in a @entity1 shirt			0
usually threatens opposition players with his speed but never got going			0
@entity135 - 5 drove city forward at times and had his work cut - out with @entity140 putting in another less - than - convincing effort			0
@entity140 - 5.5 two glorious chances to score , both in the second half			0
the first , @entity22 somehow kept out with a diving save , the second he curled on to the bar			0
@entity14 - 7 combined well with @entity24 for @entity1 's most dangerous attacks			2
sensational solo goal to shimmy past two and bend in an effort			0
@entity14 scored to reduce @entity0 's lead , but @entity1 could not find an equaliser @entity24 was disappointing and should have been sent off in the first half replays of @entity24 's tackle shows that he should have been sent off for a two - footed lunge on @entity64 @entity24 - 5.5 @entity156 and looked sharp on the ball , getting away a few long - range efforts , but @entity0 did well to nullify his threat			1
still should 've scored on three occasions			0
@entity161 - 5 a very quiet afternoon for the striker , who needs to start scoring to warrant a place in @entity1 's starting line - up			2
manager : @entity9 - 5			0

@entity10 opened the scoring for @entity0 at @entity4
on - form @entity11 doubled the lead with 15 minutes to play
