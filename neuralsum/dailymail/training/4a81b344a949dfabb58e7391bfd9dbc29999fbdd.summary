@entity0 , who turns 36 in november , was allowed to leave @entity5 at the end of last season after 12 successful years at @entity8			1
the defender was a free agent while he worked as a television pundit at the @entity11 in @entity12 and although several offers came from @entity14 and abroad , he was preparing to hang up his boots before @entity16 came in			1
' i would have done tv , maybe coaching			0
i enjoyed the tv work in the summer so i would have done more of that			0
' he continued : ' my representatives spoke to a few teams out in @entity40 , the @entity41 and @entity42 as well but the main thing was getting back to @entity28 and when @entity3 gave me the call , all bets were off			1
' @entity0 is reported to have taken a significant wage cut to join @entity3 's side and the 35 - year - old insists he has a special affection for @entity4 , having played at the club as a boy			1
' i could have earned a lot more money elsewhere but the money has never been an issue for me , ' @entity0 said			1
' people sometimes forget that when you are a kid , you play football because you love playing football			0
' this was not about money , it was about playing in a competitive league , in @entity28 , for a team i have an affinity with from years ago			1
' this was the first club i ever went to as a kid			0
' considered answers : @entity0 addressed some issues about his time at @entity5 during the conference @entity0 left @entity16 as a teenager for @entity73 after being spotted playing for the district team by @entity76 senior , who was on the @entity73 ' coaching staff at the time			1
@entity3 took over as manager at @entity80 not long after and he handed @entity0 his first - team debut in may 1996 , bringing the centre half on as a substitute in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity85 on the final day of the season			1
' any player will tell you , if a manager gives you your first chance in football , they will always hold a place in your heart , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity3 was always supporting me , singing my praises , telling me off when i needed to be told off			2
' @entity0 continued : ' we 've stayed in contact ever since			2
we would sometimes go six months without speaking but when i 've seen him it 's like it was back in the day			0
' there has always been a connection			0
he has not changed much , he has not even got any grey hairs			0
' the former @entity5 man is likely to be paired in central defence alongside @entity106 , who has been brought in from @entity107 and is 13 years @entity0 's junior			1
despite being let go by @entity5 , records showed @entity0 was the fourth highest in the @entity111 squad last season when it came to being fit and available for match selection			2
' some people question my fitness but over the last two years i have been one of the most ever - present in terms of training and games , ' @entity0 said			1

' @entity0 won six @entity122 titles , an @entity147 and a @entity149 trophy during his stay at @entity8 and has been capped 81 times for @entity14			2
a potential relegation battle at @entity132 will pose a different challenge to what he has been used to previously but @entity0 insists survival with @entity4 would be another achievement to add to his list			1
' all i play for is winning trophies - i am not silly enough to think we are going to win the title but hopefully we can have a good cup run , ' @entity0 said			1
' i will not be feeling that buzz here but staying up will be an unbelievable achievement			0
