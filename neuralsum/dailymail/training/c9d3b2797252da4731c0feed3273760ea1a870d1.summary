by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 04:34 est , 17 october 2013 pupils at one of @entity4 's top pre-prep schools have been banned from having nuts for breakfast at home in cases it triggers a reaction in fellow classmates			1
@entity12 in @entity4 , which has tuition fees of £ 13,320 - a - year , sent a letter to parents saying children must not have peanut butter or cereals with nuts during the week			1
the strict policy has been put in place because the school claims some pupils have ' extreme allergies ' where even the smell could trigger a severe reaction			1
rules : @entity12 in @entity4 has told parents not to let their children eat anything containing nuts for breakfast because the smell could trigger an allergic reaction the private school , which takes boys between the ages of four and eight , has also asked children not to bring in sandwiches or yoghurt for their break because they could be ' messy ' in the classroom			1
@entity43 miss @entity42 said in her welcome letter at the start of the year : ' owing to some extreme allergies , please do not give your son anything like peanut butter or cereals containing nuts for breakfast during the week as this can have an effect on boys with allergies			1
' many schools in the @entity57 have already prohibited children from bringing products containing nuts into schools , but @entity12 has gone one step further , extending the ban to morning meals at home			2
a charity which supports people with severe allergies is against such bans in schools because it threatens to give children a ' false sense of security '			2
guidelines : a copy of @entity43 miss @entity42 ' welcome letter which outlines the rules the @entity77 said : ' there is a strong case for arguing that food - allergic children will gain a better awareeness of their allergies , and learn avoidance strategies , if they move in an environment where allergies may turn up unexpectedly ' miss @entity42 said she had received no complaints from parents since the stringent policy was introduced			1
she told @entity90 : ' we 've had boys with allergies so severe that , even if they 're sitting next to someone who has eaten something like nuts or dairy , that can cause a reaction			2
' facts : around one in 100 people in the @entity57 suffer from a nut allergy , with most being children peanuts are among the most common allergy - causing foods and affect around one in every 100 people in the @entity57			2
although a small amount of peanut protein can set off a severe reaction , it is rare for a reaction to be triggered just from breathing in small particles of nuts or peanuts			0
most foods containing peanuts do not allow enough protein to escape into the air to cause a reaction and , according to website @entity122 , just the smell of foods containing peanuts wo n't produce a reaction because the scent does not contain the protein			0
the allergy to peanut and tree nuts is the most common found in adults and children			0
however , since most children start eating other foods first , allergies to other foods such as egg and cows ' milk protein typically present before nut allergies			0
while children often grow out of other allergies , only around 20 % of children with nut allergies resolve			0
this means that 4 out of 5 children with nut allergies will continue to have these allergies as an adult			0
in some people , the allergy may become less severe with age , but in 20 % , it can become worse with time .			0
