when @entity1 , a blonde divorcee from @entity2 , met her future husband @entity3 , she was instantly smitten - but was shocked when he revealed that he felt the same way			1
for at 70 , @entity1 was almost 50 years older than the @entity6 waiter who had caught her eye during an all - girls holiday			1
after a whirlwind romance , the couple married in 2007 and , to begin with , were blissfully happy together			1
in love : @entity1 , now 77 , was smitten with @entity6 waiter @entity3 , now 28 , and the couple married in 2007 whirlwind romance : the couple wed less than a year after meeting when @entity3 was just 21 but after @entity3 was refused a @entity17 visa , things began to fall apart and the couple are now divorced , while @entity3 , now 28 , has relocated to @entity19			1
despite her heartbreak , @entity1 says she has many happy memories of @entity3 and would do it all again if she got the chance			1
' i went to @entity6 with my sister and her friends , ' says @entity1 of her fateful first meeting with @entity3 in 2006			1
' i 'd never been very far in my life and it was very exciting			2
there were five of us , all single ladies having a really nice time			2
' while relaxing by the pool , @entity1 's sister and friends began chatting to one of the waiters and while she found him attractive , she had no idea that the feeling might be mutual			1
' i did n't know all these young men chased @entity44 women , ' she remembers			2
' i had no idea ! there was an instant attraction between me and this waiter but i never did anything , i never said anything			2
' then he sent me this little note : " would i like to go for a coffee ? " @entity54			2
and i said to my sister : " is he crackers ? what does he want with an old biddy like me when there 's all these young birds around ? " ' despite her misgivings , @entity1 decided to go and meet him anyway - and was soon smitten			1
' i knew there was a relationship brewing , ' she says			0
' he 'd planted it in my head and i knew			0
' things swiftly became serious and eventually , @entity3 invited her to meet his family , who lived in @entity72 , a tiny town in the far south of @entity6			1
' they lived out in the desert , ' she remembers			0
' all his family lived there , everybody			0
@entity78 , his grandmother , the lot			0
' they came in droves to come and say hello to me because they 'd never seen an @entity44 lady with blonde hair and blue eyes before			0
' culture shock : @entity3 's home in the desert town of @entity72 near @entity90 was unlike anything @entity1 knew misgivings : despite her concerns , the couple married and @entity3 applied for a @entity17 visa but was denied but despite the warm welcome , cultural differences swiftly became apparent			1
' his mum had made a room for us with a mattress on the floor and no door on , ' she laughs			0
' i did n't know how i was going to sleep there with him and i was shocked because they 're @entity108 and i did n't think they 'd do anything like that			0
' we only stayed there two days , ' she adds			0
' i could n't live like that			0
there was no bath , no shower and the toilet was horrendous			0
it was a hole in the floor and you had to stand over it straddle - legged			0
' despite the discomforts , @entity1 was falling more and more in love with @entity3 and found herself liking his family , despite their constant questions about whether or not the two would marry			1
' when we were at his mum 's , they kept saying : " will you marry @entity3 ? " and i said : " goodness me , no ! no , no , no ! i 've got no intention of getting married			1
" ' i 'd already been divorced 40 - odd years from my first husband , who is now dead			1
they kept saying , " you must think about it @entity1 "			1
' deeply in love , she decided to take the plunge and the couple married in a ceremony held at a registry office in nearby @entity90			1
although 21 - year - old @entity3 's mother and aunt were there to see it , none of @entity1 's friends or family came to the wedding			1
popular : @entity17 women are in demand with @entity6 men , although not always for the right reasons instead , an overjoyed @entity1 sent text messages to her relations following the ceremony and settled down to enjoy the wonderful weeks that followed			1
' age was n't a big issue at all , ' she adds			0
' well , it was , it was in the beginning , because he loves kids but we talked about adopting as well			0
' but while the age gap may not have mattered , their living arrangements did and disaster struck when @entity3 was denied a @entity17 visa			1
' he did want to come to @entity44 but everybody does , ' says @entity1			1
' these @entity108 countries are n't in the @entity171 so they ca n't come here			0
' weeks after applying for a @entity17 visa in @entity173 , @entity3 phoned @entity1 to tell her that his application had been turned down			1
' he rang me to tell me he 'd been refused entry , ' she remembers			2
' he was very upset			0
i was upset too so i applied again in @entity44 and they turned me down again			0
' the reason ? the judge was n't convinced the relationship would last			0
' he said : " if we allow him into @entity44 , there is no evidence that you will stay together			2
" new life : @entity3 has now moved to @entity19 and the couple have divorced - much to @entity1 's distress ' and i said : " well , there 's no evidence that any marriage will stay together			1
it does n't matter whether he 's @entity6 or where he comes from "			2
' despite her protests , the judge remained unmoved and a furious @entity3 gave @entity1 an ultimatum : if he could n't come to the @entity17 , then she would have to move to @entity6			1
' i did n't like that idea , ' she admits			0
with the couple 's relationship floundering and @entity3 unable to get a job in his native country , he began looking abroad , to @entity19 , for work			1
when , after months of searching , he did indeed find work in the @entity206 kingdom , the writing was on the wall for @entity1 and @entity3 's marriage			1
' he said we had to divorce , ' says @entity1 , sadly			2
' he said he could n't go to @entity19 to work with a wife in the background			2
' so i said : " you will have to do it because i have no intention of divorcing you "			0
and apparently , he did but i do n't know [ for certain ] because i have no paper work			0
' when you love somebody and you 've finished , it just does n't go away , ' she adds			0
' the hurt does n't go away , it 's still there			0
i 've cried buckets over this , i have , really			2
' despite her heartbreak , @entity1 has no regrets and admits that she could see herself doing the same thing for a second time			2
' i have lots of happy memories , ' she smiles			2
' he was very romantic			0
i had a fabulous time and i could definitely do it all again			0
