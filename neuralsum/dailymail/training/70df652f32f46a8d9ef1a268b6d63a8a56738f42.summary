@entity0 bounced back from his opening day doom at the @entity2 as he fired a two - under - par 70 on friday			1
the 38 - year - old is making his comeback this week after four months out through injury and had a nightmare first round as he sunk to the bottom of the leaderboard after an opening 77			1
that round will almost certainly have ended any chance the 14 - time major winner had of winning the tournament he annually hosts which benefits his foundation , but only a double - bogey on the last stopped him from dipping into the 60s on friday			1
@entity0 disposes of his driver after a wayward shot off the tee during his second round in @entity22 woods opened with a birdie but gave that shot back on eight before an eagle on the par - five 13th brought his round to life			1
a birdie followed on 14 and another on 16 had @entity23 four under for the day but a rain delay of around 90 minutes after he came off 17 halted his momentum and a flat finish on the last meant he was three - over for the tournament			2
despite taking seven shots less than he did in his opening round , @entity0 did not feel that his play was markedly better on friday			1
' it was n't a whole lot different , ' he told @entity38 4			0
' i maybe hit two less worse shots than i did yesterday , but it really was n't that much different			0
' @entity0 keeps an eye out for his errant tee shot on the seventh hole , as the @entity45 continued to struggle the 14 - time @entity46 winner looked despondent after another off target shot during his comeback tournament @entity0 has spent a lot of time away from the game in recent years and admits it is not always easy to get back into his rhythm			1
' sometimes it takes me a few holes , sometimes it can only take me a shot to feel like i 'm back into tournament mode , ' he added			0
' it all depends on my preparation , but also it depends on my feels			0
' @entity0 was still propping up the leaderboard , but at the other end @entity64 had opened up a two - shot lead over @entity67			1
@entity64 surged into the lead with a five under par second round before play resumes on saturday the weather delay meant that the later starters were playing in almost total darkness and @entity64 was five under for his round and 11 under for the tournament when he picked up his ball on 18 and he will return to finish on saturday morning			1
the 21 - year - old reached the turn level after two birdies and a double bogey but he picked up shots on 10 , 12,13 , 14 and 16 to overhaul @entity67			2
' if i did it over again , i may have stopped playing on 17 , ' he said			0
' but i thought we may be able to get it in here			0
' with a tricky lie down there into the green it 's just a good idea to hit that pitch tomorrow			0
' woods , searching for his ball after a wayward tee shot on the seventh , managed to recover on the back nine @entity67 finished with a 68 and would have been alongside @entity64 were it not for bogeys on 15 and 16 which dropped him into second after six birdies in his first 13 holes			2
@entity100 was a further shot back after registering the low round of the day with a 63 and he admitted that , after reaching the turn in 29 , his mind wandered to going sub- 60			0
' after i birdied 10 it kind of got in my mind , but i thought it for about hole 11 and 12 and after that i was like , ' you just need to get back and play golf '			0
' @entity112 was also on eight under courtesy of a 64 which saw him birdie nine of his last 13 holes after dropping over par for the day with a double bogey on five			2
@entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 were a further shot back with @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 all on six under			0
@entity128 was the only other player alongside @entity64 who did not finish their round and he will return to the 18th green on saturday morning			2
woods and @entity100 , right , cover themselves on the 18th tee as an afternoon rainstorm stops play the 38 - year - old chips from off the green during his second round at the @entity2 in @entity22 @entity0 fails to contain his anguish during a frustrating end to his round , with a double bogey on the 18th			1

@entity0 hit made an opening birdie and one bogey on the front nine
the @entity45 fired in an eagle on the 13th but hit double - bogey on 18
