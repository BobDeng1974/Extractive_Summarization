a mentally ill woman who is 23 weeks pregnant has the right to decide for herself if she wants an abortion , a judge ruled yesterday			1
the 37 - year - old married woman , who suffers from bipolar disorder , wanted a termination but doctors responsible for her care said she was not capable of making such a decision because of her illness			1
but yesterday mr @entity11 defied the opinions of psychiatrists and the wishes of her mother and husband and said it would be a ‘ total affront ’ to say she did not have the capacity to make the decision for herself			1
doctors have lost their case against a woman with a ' severe mental disorder ' who they wanted to stop having an abortion the woman - who said she was not mentally ill but had suffered a ' nervous breakdown ' - told the judge that she wanted to divorce her husband and that he was ' completely indifferent ' when told of her pregnancy			1
she said about two months ago she had started to think , ' i do n't really want the baby '			0
' i have no real support from my husband , ' she said			1
' it would never work			0
i do n't really see a future in terms of my relationship with ( him )			0
' mr @entity11 said he accepted that she was ' mentally unwell ' but he said the question was whether she was ' incapable of making a decision ' she said medication had turned her into a ' zombie ' and she was very worried about her ability to care for the child			2
' i have no money			0
i would not be able to work			0
i would be starting in a council flat on my own , ' she said			0
' the situation i am in , the idea of me having a baby			0
i think it is just crazy			0
' the woman added : ' i would not regret that i got rid of it			2
' she said she would try to commit suicide if she was unable to terminate the pregnancy			0
' i would seek to kill myself and the baby , ' she said			0
' i have pretty much had enough of the whole situation			0
the only way they could force me to have the pregnancy is by tying me down and locking me up			0
' mr @entity11 heard evidence from the woman , a consultant psychiatrist involved in her care , from a lawyer representing her husband and from her mother			1
the psychiatrist said he was ' 100 per cent certain ' that the woman lacked the capacity to make a decision about termination			1
a lawyer representing her husband , who was at the hearing , said he agreed with the psychiatrist 's evaluation			2
in january this year , a pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties was told she would not be forced to have an abortion after the @entity85 ruled she had the mental capacity to decide if she wanted the baby			1
doctors applied for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy claiming the child was endangering her life			0
but the judge ruled the mother must still have the right to decide despite having a ' significant learning impairment '			0
the woman , who was not named for legal reasons , was described as being in the ' bottom one per cent of the @entity101 population ' in terms of cognitive ability			1
mr @entity104 said even if the pregnant woman did not have the capacity to care for the baby , society does			1
her mother also agreed with the psychiatrist and said she feared that her daughter might later regret seeking a termination			0
mr @entity11 said in most cases in the @entity113 , which is part of the @entity85 and analyses issues involving sick and vulnerable people , the views of psychiatrists on mental capacity issues were ' determinative '			1
but he said that after hearing evidence from the woman he had reached a different view in this case			2
the judge said he accepted that she was ' mentally unwell ' but he said the question was whether she was ' incapable of making a decision '			2
' there is no doubt she has the capacity to make a decision , ' said mr @entity11			1
' it would be a total affront to the autonomy of this lady to conclude that she lacks capacity to the level required to make this decision			1
' he said even if some thoughts and views on her husband were ' skewed ' or ' paranoid or delusional ' she had given many other reasons for her desire to terminate the pregnancy			2
the judge said the woman had said she was unhappy in detention and asked him to imagine being ' unhappy and pregnant '			2
' it seems to me to be a perfectly understandable position for detained pregnant mother to take , ' he added			2
' it has not been established that she lacks capacity to make decisions about terminating the pregnancy			1

the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , is 23 weeks pregnant
medics argued she lacks mental capacity to make the decision herself
she told the @entity113 she has ' no real support ' from her husband
