by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity0 wears a purple patterned dress , £ 55 , from @entity3			1
she said : ' fitted perfectly			2
bit too sensible for me , but many women will love this frock ' there are endless advantages to being tall			1
it does n't matter where i sit in the cinema or theatre , i can always see ( i do n’t worry about the poor souls who have to sit behind me ! )			2
and all my vital statistics are spaced a bit further apart , so i can easily pass for a dress size smaller than my usual size 14 ( or 16 if i ’ve been eating a lot of carbs and loafing about )			2
however , there are downsides			0
finding clothes that fit is really difficult , especially if you 're out of your 20s			0
the young and super-slender can get away with really short clothes from regular ranges on the @entity28 , ( relying on opaque tights to save their modesty )			1
but once you get older and want stuff that 's fashionable and not mumsy , the problems begin			0
and do n't even get me started on finding decent shoes - women who are 6ft tall like me generally have size 8 feet , and most shops just go up to size 7			1
once , only models were tall , but now it 's the norm			1
my generation got free school milk and turned out to be giants , and in the subsequent decades girls have just got taller			0
but clothing manufacturers seem reluctant to cater for this growing market			0
one mail reader , @entity46 , emailed me to protest about this			0
' i do n't understand why tall clothing is being taken out of @entity28 stores like @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
all the places that tall women relied on to dress them for work , for parties or just casualwear			1
' these stores think it 's ok to stock the odd " long " pair of trousers , most of which are so awful they 've been left on the rail for a month			0
and yet , the " petite " range is still going strong in most stores , fully stocked with the latest trends			0
' @entity46 makes the point that many tall ranges are now available solely online , and that when you buy on the internet , you ca n't try things on , you have to pay a delivery charge , and finding tall ranges online can be confusing			1
she asks : ' would stores get rid of disabled access because it was n't being used enough ? of course not			0
so why treat tall women as if they do n't matter ? ' my sentiments entirely			1
why are tall women treated like fashion pariahs ? why should we have to spend twice as long as everyone else shopping for clothes ? even if we are prepared to spend a lot of money on designer clothes , it 's difficult to get something which fits			1
i 've noticed that coats have become shorter than ever			0
on me they now just about cover my backside , and are basically long jackets			0
tall women can never buy any clothing with a waist - even if they are lucky enough to have a waist - because it will be situated just under their bust in normal clothing ranges			1
slim pickings : @entity0 says there are n't enough @entity28 stores stocking clothes for tall women all fitted clothing in standard ranges is cut to suit regular proportions , but tall girls need more length in the body			1
as a stock size 14 , tops are not really a problem - as long as i do n't want sleeves that actually reach my wrist			0
jackets fit , but if they are waisted , it will be about three inches too far north			0
sleeves that are supposed to end just below the elbow - three - quarter length - look horrific , bunching up around the fattest bit of our arms			0
sweaters are about the only thing a tall girl can buy easily			1
dresses , even by top designers , either just cover the knee , which is ok , because that will still be a decent length - or are cut so short that they look like tunics			1
when you buy clothes online , they rarely provide the length of the skirt or dress , so you can never be sure if they 'll be decent enough of course , we can go to specialist shops like @entity3 , but why should our choice be so pitifully small ? designers routinely showcase their collections on super-tall catwalk models , but then manufacture them for very short people			1
the reason is probably to keep costs down , because fabric costs money and skirts the length of a pelmet are cheaper to manufacture than something more practical for women over 5ft 4in			2
i used to regularly shop for trousers at @entity160 and @entity51 , but their ranges have definitely got smaller			2
upmarket brands like @entity164 really score well - they cut dresses so cleverly a size large fits me perfectly and is sufficiently long			0
i ca n't recommend them enough - but if you do n't live in @entity169 , you can only shop online , with less choice			2
some of the edition ranges at @entity172 are great , too			2
but when you buy clothes online , they rarely provide the length of the skirt or dress , so you can never be sure if they 'll be decent enough for travel on public transport , and you have to pay delivery charges			2
i 'm lucky enough to have a stylist who scours the @entity28 to find me clothes to wear on @entity185 's @entity184 ( and posts the details on its website )			0
but most tall women rightly feel very fed up			1
why do retailers hate us so much when we look so good in clothes ? you 'd think they ’d be fighting to dress us			0
sadly , the reverse is true			0
@entity52 : this red lace dress , £ 60 , would be lovelyon someone no larger than a size 10 , as the flared skirt emphasises the hips @entity164 : this spray pattern dress , £ 89 , hangsbeautifully - and , best of all , the length is perfect fortaller women @entity160 : tall range jeans , £ 36 to £ 42			1
i have bought them and while they are n't great quality , they are cheap and always come in the latest colours @entity209 : these £ 35 treggings in long fitted well , better than wider trousers which tend to make tall girls look like traffic wardens if not tailored properly to flatter our backsides			2

many ranges for tall women are now only available online
