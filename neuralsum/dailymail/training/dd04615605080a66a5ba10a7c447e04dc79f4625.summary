by @entity0 @entity2 's adopted son has opened up to @entity3 about his convicted pedophile father 's bedtime ' ritual '			1
@entity7 , one of the six children adopted by the @entity10 coach and his wife , previously revealed he was sexually abused by his father for seven years , starting when he was just eight			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity3 , which will air in full on @entity15 at 9pm on thursday night , he revealed that the @entity2 home was a very happy place to be - until that bedtime ritual			1
' the overnight visits were ... they were good , ' @entity7 said in a preview clip for the interview			1
' i mean , except for that one part : bedtime			2
@entity25 was the bad part			0
you 'd look at that family and you would say , " wow			2
i wish that i had brothers and sisters that cared about me			0
i wish that i had a mother who cooked dinner every night for the whole family			0
i wish that i had all of these things			0
' but then at bedtime , his ritual began			0
' the interview will be his first television since his father was convicted in 2012			1
ahead of its airing , @entity15 explained that @entity7 would be sharing ' a deeply personal account of the grooming , methodical control and manipulation he faced as a child '			1
it adds that @entity7 will respond ' to the accusations his adoptive mother , @entity61 , made on national television accusing him of lying and stealing from the family '			1
@entity7 , who retired in june 30 , 1999 as @entity10 's defensive coordinator , was convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years , some in the football team 's showers on campus			1
pedophile : @entity2 , pictured in january 2013 , was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for his crimes the 70 - year - old is now serving a 30 - to 60 - year state prison sentence			1
@entity7 had met @entity7 when he attended his charity summer camp for underprivileged children and he often stayed the night with the family			1
he began living with the family full - time when he was 16			2
he had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until the trial , when he told investigators that he also had been abused			0
his story first became public when a secret tape of a 29 - minute interview he did with police during the middle of his father 's trial was leaked to @entity89			2
in the tape , @entity90 said his father would enter his bedroom at night and ' blow raspberries ' on his stomach , then move his hand down his body , rubbing up against his genitals			0
he said he would sometimes cower ' in a fetal position ' in his bed trying to avoid his father			0
in total , he said he suffered seven years of molestation , between the ages of eight and 15 , at the hands of his adoptive father			0
he initially denied there had been any abuse before speaking out			0
in an interview for a documentary at the @entity109 in january , he said that he felt ' betrayed ' by the entire @entity7 family after he took the decision to speak out against his father			1
hurtful : @entity7 said he felt betrayed by his adopted mother @entity112 , right in 2011 , after they failed to support him when he came forward with allegations about his father 's abuse but he said that he refused to be a ' coward ' and risked everything to turn against those who had adopted him from a deprived upbringing and brought him up in an affluent household			2
last year he reached a settlement with @entity10 and petitioned to legally change his name , and that of his wife and four children			0
the interview comes a few weeks after @entity129 's attorney general released a review of the prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by then governor @entity134			0
the report , however , did reveal three years of ' inexplicable delays ' to prosecute the former @entity10 football coach on child abuse charges			0
the pedophile 's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year , from march 2009 until march 2010 , for the office to recommend charging @entity7 when ' @entity144 ' came forward			1
it took more 18 months before @entity7 was arrested because the prosecutor 's supervisors believed the testimony of one victim would be ' insufficient against a community icon like @entity7 '			2

@entity7 will speak out *tonight* in his first tv interview since @entity2 was convicted and sentenced to 30 - 60 years in 2012
@entity7 , who started staying with the family after meeting @entity7 at his summer camp for underprivileged children , was abused from age 8
in a preview clip for the interview , he explains that the @entity7 home was a happy place to be - until bedtime
