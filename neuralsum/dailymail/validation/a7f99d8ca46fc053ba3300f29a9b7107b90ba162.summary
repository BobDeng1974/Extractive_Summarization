robots will use humans as pets once they achieve a subset of artificial intelligence known as ' superintelligence '			1
this is according to @entity7 - founder @entity6 who claims that when computers become smarter than people , they will treat them like ' pet labradors '			1
his comments were made in a recent interview with scientist @entity14 , who added that computers could choose to breed docile humans and eradicate the violent ones			1
@entity14 : ' a pet lab ' musk : ' i have a pet @entity27 by the way			1
' @entity14 : ' we 'll be their pets			2
' musk : ' it 's like the friendliest creature			0
' @entity14 : ' no , they 'll domesticate us			2
' musk : ' yes ! exactly ' @entity14 : ' so we 'll be lab pets to them			2
' musk : ' yes			0
or something strange is going to happen			0
' @entity14 : ' they 'll keep the docile humans and get rid of the violent ones			1
' @entity14 : ' and then breed the docile humans			1
' listen to the full interview here			2
@entity6 has already likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			2
but in his latest interview , @entity6 said his fears revolve around something known as superintelligence			1
this , according to author @entity57 , is ' any intellect that greatly exceed the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest			2
' ' i mean , we wo n't be like a pet @entity27 if we 're lucky , ' @entity6 told @entity14 , adding that we may become lab pets to them			1
@entity14 theorised that robots will ' get rid of the violent ones ... and then breed the docile humans '			1
@entity6 also said humanity needs to be careful about what it programs superintelligent robots to do			1
he uses the example of asking them to find out what makes people happy			0
' it may conclude that all unhappy humans should be terminated , ' @entity6 said			1
' or that we should all be captured with dopamine and serotonin directly injected into our brains to maximise happiness because it 's concluded that dopamine and serotonin are what cause happiness , therefore maximise it			0
' @entity93 co-founder , @entity92 , this week made similar comments during an interview with @entity96 at @entity97			1
the 64 - year - old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human - like computers could be a dangerous reality			1
@entity93 co-founder , @entity92 , this week made similar comments			1
the 64 - year - old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human - like computers could be a dangerous reality			1
he asked : ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? ' he quipped : ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? ' ' computers are going to take over from humans , no question , ' he added			0
' if we build these devices to take care of everything for us , eventually they 'll think faster than us and they 'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently			0
he also directly referenced warnings issued by both @entity6 and @entity121 about the threat @entity123 has on humanity			1
they are part of a group of experts , known collectively as the @entity129 , who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
' computers are going to take over from humans , no question , ' said @entity92			1
' if we build these devices to take care of everything for us , eventually they 'll think faster than us and they 'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently			0
@entity144 's human - like robot is pictured the authors said there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity123 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			2
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity123 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			2
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity123 may put millions of people out of work			2
earlier this month @entity163 boss mr @entity6 said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots			1
the entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply ' too dangerous ' behind the wheel			2
the ' @entity172 ' has a cub - like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair ( pictured ) or a floor - level bed to a bath , for example a recent report by management consulting firm @entity181 predicted by 2025 the number of ' automatable ' tasks will rise to 25 per cent			0
this will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in @entity188			0
earlier this week @entity190 - @entity189 in @entity191 , @entity188 unveiled its latest @entity172			0
the ' @entity172 ' has a cub - like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor - level bed to a bath			0
it weighs 309lb ( 140kg ) with extending legs that stop the ' bear ' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms			0
and at the start of the month , @entity203 said it will begin employing a humanoid called @entity206 in its branches from april , on a trial basis			0
and if the trial is successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the @entity188 bank by 2020			0
elsewhere , in @entity214 there is a hotel manned entirely by robots			0
from reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters , the @entity217 in @entity218 , @entity214 , has built , rather than hired , new employees			0
start - up costs and robot maintenance aside , staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night 's stay costs just Â£ 6.80 per night .			0
