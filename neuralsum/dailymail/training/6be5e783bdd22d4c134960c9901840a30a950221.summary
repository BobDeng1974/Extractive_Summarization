by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:32 am on 14th december 2011 @entity2 is threatening to close off the world 's most important oil shipping lane as tensions between it and the west mount following the capture of an unmanned @entity10 spy plane			1
@entity11 , a member of the @entity2 parliament 's @entity12 , said his country was preparing to close off the crucial @entity15 as part of a military exercise			1
around a third of all shipped oil passes through the four mile - wide @entity15 between @entity20 and @entity2 and @entity10 warships patrol the area to ensure safe passage			1
threat : an @entity2 politician claims the country 's military is preparing to close off the @entity15 - the most important oil transport channel in the world most of the crude exported from @entity32 , @entity2 , the @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 - together with nearly all the liquefied natural gas from lead exporter @entity37 is transported through the channel			1
mr @entity11 told the @entity2 student news agency @entity40 : ' soon we will hold a military manoeuvre on how to close the @entity15			2
if the world wants to make the region insecure , we will make the world insecure			0
' @entity11 , a member of the @entity2 parliament 's @entity12 , said @entity2 was preparing to close off the @entity15 as part of an exercise after a news agency mistakenly reported the straight had already been closed , crude oil prices leapt by almost $ 2 to $ 100.45/per barrel , but they later stabilised			1
last month , @entity2 's energy minister told @entity55 that @entity56 could use oil as a political tool in the event of any future conflict over its nuclear program			1
tensions over the program have increased since the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) reported on november 8 that @entity56 appears to have worked on designing a nuclear bomb and may still be pursuing research to that end			0
@entity2 strongly denies this and says it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes			2
@entity2 has warned it will respond to any attack by hitting @entity72 and @entity10 interests in the @entity74 and analysts say one way to retaliate would be to close the @entity15			2
yesterday former @entity10 vice-president @entity77 said president @entity78 should have ordered an airstrike over @entity2 after their refusal to hand back the unmanned spyplane that crashed last week			1
during a @entity84 news conference with @entity35 prime minister @entity85 , mr @entity78 said : ' we have asked for it back			0
we 'll see how the @entity2 respond			2
' but mr @entity77 told @entity88 : ' the right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it			2
important : around a third of the world 's shipped oil passes through the @entity15 ' you can do that from the air and , in effect , make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone , but [ @entity78 ] asked nicely for them to return it , and they are n't going to			1
' @entity2 president @entity104 said he had not intention of returning the @entity107 high - altitude reconnaissance drone			1
mr @entity77 added that the @entity2 will likely send the drone back ' in pieces after they ’ve gotten all the intelligence they can out of it			1
' interviewed on @entity113 television last night , president @entity104 said : ' there are people here who have been able to control this spy plane , who can surely analyse this plane 's system also			1
former @entity10 vice-president @entity77 said president @entity78 should have ordered an airstrike over @entity2 after their refusal to hand back the unmanned spy plane that crashed last week ' the @entity10 have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane			1
we now have control of this plane			0
' mr @entity78 refused to comment on what the @entity2 might learn from studying the drone			2
@entity10 officials say @entity2 had nothing to do with the drone crashing to earth and claim it simply malfunctioned			2
general @entity134 , deputy head of @entity2 's elite @entity135 , said on state television that the violation of @entity2 's airspace by the @entity10 drone was a ' hostile act ' and warned of a ' bigger ' response			1
officials in @entity2 even believe they can ' mass produce ' the captured bat - winged stealthy @entity107 and build a ' superior ' version following its crash on december 4			1
@entity146 , the head of @entity2 's parliamentary national security committee , said today : ' our next action will be to reverse - engineer the aircraft			1
' in the near future , we will be able to mass produce it ... @entity2 engineers will soon build an aircraft superior to the @entity10 using reverse engineering			2
' it also emerged today that @entity2 has lodged a complaint with @entity159 following calls made during @entity10 congressional hearings to assassinate members of @entity56 ’s security agency			1
former @entity10 army vice chief of staff gen. @entity164 and former @entity166 operative @entity165 , now a senior fellow for the @entity168 , told the subcommittee hearing on ' @entity2 @entity170 , ' that they were in favour of carrying out covert operations against members of @entity174 , a special unit of @entity2 's @entity135			1
in his speech , @entity164 suggested sanctions against @entity56 were not sufficient and suggested cyberattacks , covert actions and assassination would be more effective			0
he told the hearing : ' why are we permitting the @entity184 leaders , who have been organizing this killing of us for 30 years , to go around , still walking around ? ' why do n’t we kill them ? we kill other people who are running terrorist organizations against the @entity10			0
these guys have killed almost a thousand of us			0
why do n’t we kill them ? ' and @entity165 said : ' @entity2 would not look like the country it is today if they were concerned about the bottom line			0
@entity192 : officials in @entity2 claim they can ' mass produce ' the captured @entity107 drone and build a ' superior ' version following its crash on december 4 ' so i do n’t think that you ’re going to really intimidate these people , get their attention , unless you shoot somebody – it ’s pretty blunt , but i do n’t think you get to get around it			0
' @entity2 ’s national prosecutor general , @entity205 told @entity2 television that a case had been opened and that the judiciary was ' providing more documents to the @entity159 , so that the two @entity10 , who have threatened the @entity2 commander with assassination , would be prosecuted			0
' the hearing , which took place on october 26 , was held in response to an alleged plot by @entity174 to assassinate of the @entity32 ambassador in @entity218 and carry out a string of terrorist attacks on @entity10 soil			0
@entity174 ' commander general @entity222 has been accused of numerous covert terrorist activities , including helping @entity225 militias carry out attacks on @entity10 and @entity228 troops in @entity35			0
@entity165 told the hearing : ' @entity222 travels a lot , he ’s all over the place			0
either try to capture him , or kill him			0
i think you have to send a pretty powerful message to those who have undertaken this , or i think down the road you ’re asking for it			0
they will read this not as a response of someone who ’s strong , but as a response of someone who ’s weak			0
' @entity2 defense minister @entity245 claims the remarks were part of a ' devilish triangle of terrorism , human rights violation and use of @entity252 ' by the @entity10			0
' the @entity2 have also highlighted a letter to president @entity78 from @entity255 chairman rep. @entity254 and two subcommittee chairs urging ' significant covert action against the @entity2 regime , including against facilities and personnel responsible for killing our troops in @entity263 and @entity35			0
