his bold , ambitious words befitted the city in which they were delivered			2
on the @entity5 leg of @entity7 ’s summer tour , @entity3 was asked his main aim for the year			1
‘ i want a trophy this year , ’ @entity3 replied without hesitation			1
‘ i want the club to win big trophies again			2
the expectancy this season is continual improvement			0
to be successful is winning trophies			0
’ that statement was given on august 1 , when hopes were high and confidence was soaring			0
fast forward to december 17 and the picture is dramatically different			0
there has been no continual improvement , just a litany of disappointment and frustration			0
@entity3 arrives at @entity7 's training ground ahead of the @entity29 tie at @entity30 @entity31 - showing off his new shaved haircut - arrives at @entity33 for training @entity35 drives his car into the car park at @entity33 as @entity7 prepare for @entity30 still , though , @entity3 ’ dream is alive			1
though the two biggest prizes — the @entity40 and @entity41 — have disappeared , the @entity29 could yet be the competition that turns the tide for @entity7 ’s embattled manager			1
this , after all , is a trophy that has spent more time being polished at @entity48 than anywhere else			0
@entity7 have won the @entity29 a record - breaking eight times , most recently in 2012			1
they have also contested the most finals ( 11 ) and semi-finals ( 14 )			0
history , however , is no help to @entity3 in these trying moments			1
to stand a chance of stopping the rot that has set in , @entity7 will need to quarry into their reserves of resilience and find a way of negotiating another night that is littered with pitfalls			1
@entity30 , leaders of the @entity64 , versus struggling @entity7 under floodlights in a tight stadium has ‘ upset ’ written all over it			1
if that were to happen , if another ray of light were snuffed out , the damage it would cause to a campaign would be huge			0
@entity35 is enduring a nightmare start to his career at @entity7 following a £ 16m move the @entity76 striker fluffed his lines in front of goal yet again in the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity81 on sunday ‘ we want to win this competition , ’ @entity3 said			1
‘ it is the first trophy ( of the season ) you can win , so it is a priority			0
if we can get the victory and get through , hopefully that will give us the impetus to go on			0
it ’s going to be really tough but it is a challenge we are up for			2
’ @entity3 set the right tone at @entity33			1
from the moment he walked into the media room , dressed in club tracksuit , there was no sense he was stewing on the results that have torpedoed his side ’s ambitions			2
but words are meaningless unless they are backed up with performances and @entity3 , who admitted at @entity101 that @entity7 had lost their ‘ team ethos ’ , will need no reminding that critics will be studying every move of his players , looking for cracks			1
@entity109 captain @entity108 looked dejected after his side 's 3 - 0 loss at @entity101 on sunday ‘ it ’s not a distraction , ’ said @entity3 , batting away the perception of problems in the dressing room ‘ i know the players i have			1
they are a wonderful group , honest			0
some are still adapting to being at @entity7 , which is very difficult			2
‘ the spirit is strong , you saw ( against @entity81 ) at the weekend the work the players put in			2
it is not rocket science , for people to look and analyse why we ’re not what we were last season			0
‘ we have world - class players missing from our group			2
we ’ve been inconsistent and we have got many more games this season			0
we are adapting to the challenges this year and learning			0
as the season goes on , we will get stronger and stronger			0
’ @entity135 will miss the clash with @entity30 after pulling up against in the loss to @entity81 @entity31 struggling in his new role leading @entity7 's attack at @entity101 @entity31 failed to convert three one - on - one chances against @entity142 during his side 's 3 - 0 loss @entity145 ' @entity7 taking all the cups seriously ' - @entity3 that may be so but , at present , it seems like he does not know his best team			1
@entity35 — whose @entity151 hearing into a misconduct charge will be held on thursday — misses the @entity30 game with a groin problem and @entity155 is sidelined after pulling up on sunday , so @entity3 will change his starting line - up for the 27th game in a row			1
‘ the reality is we have n’t scored enough goals or been enough of a creative threat , ’ @entity3 acknowledged			2
‘ i ’m not going to persevere with a system that has not been creative for us			0
’ @entity31 will be trusted to convert @entity7 ’s chances at @entity30			1
unnecessary scrutiny on his contract has been created — @entity168 are the latest side he has been linked with — but @entity3 is calm , and said : ‘ i do n’t think there ’s anything affecting him			1
he leaves his representatives to work with the club to hopefully organise a deal .			0

the @entity40 and @entity41 are no *longer* targets for @entity3 ' side
the @entity29 could yet be the competition that turns the tide for @entity7 ’s embattled manager
@entity7 have won the @entity29 a record - breaking eight times
their most recent triumph was in 2012
@entity30 are currently leading the @entity64
@entity155 is sidelined after pulling up against @entity81
@entity3 has had to change his starting line - up for the 27th game in a row
@entity31 will again be *deployed* as a *makeshift* striker
