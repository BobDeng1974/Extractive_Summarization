but she was cleared by magistrates and now intends to sue @entity2 by @entity3 published : 17:06 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 23:01 est , 2 august 2013 humiliated : mother of two @entity5 was forced to wear a ' spit hood ' when @entity5 was threatened by a couple after complaining about their rowdy children , she called police in the hope they would protect her			1
instead , the 57 - year - old librarian was arrested by two women officers who hooded her , taped her legs together and bundled her into a van in front of a crowd of onlookers			1
miss @entity5 , who says she was made to feel ‘ totally humiliated ’ , ended up in court charged with using threatening behaviour and assaulting one of the officers			1
but the mother of two was cleared by magistrates and now intends to sue @entity2 and complain about her ordeal to the police watchdog , particularly over the use of the special hood , designed to prevent prisoners spitting at officers			1
she was kept in the hood , which looks like a plastic bag but is made of mesh , for about 15 minutes and released from it only when she began hyperventilating			1
‘ i have never been in trouble before yet i was treated like a criminal for taking a stand on unacceptable behaviour in a public place , ’ she said yesterday			0
‘ i had no idea @entity43 police could use this type of hood , which would not have looked out of place in @entity47			2
i felt i was being paraded in stocks , like in medieval times			0
‘ i was upset because i was being accused of something i did n’t do and my voice may have been raised			0
‘ i had a slight sore throat and it is possible that as i spoke to police , some tiny globules of spit hit an officer ’s face			2
but it was not deliberate and certainly did n’t merit a hood being placed over my head			0
’ miss @entity5 ’s ordeal began in december when , while out shopping in @entity63 , @entity64 , where she lives , she remonstrated with a father whose young children were constantly sounding a car horn			1
she walked away when his manner frightened her and went to the chemist			0
while she was inside the pharmacy , the children ’s mother shouted at her , ‘ wait until you come out here , you do n’t know what i ’m going to do to you ’ , @entity71 magistrates heard			2
the court was told that as miss @entity5 dialled 999 , the mother – who has convictions for assault on police , affray , disorderly behaviour , robbery and dishonesty – flagged down a passing police car containing pcs @entity88 , 33 , and @entity90 , 35			1
they arrested miss @entity5 for using threatening behaviour , kicking @entity93 and another assault – barging into an elderly woman in the shop who was never identified and did not make a complaint			1
miss @entity5 wept as she told the court how she was hooded in front of a crowd			2
‘ i was absolutely terrified , totally degraded , humiliated , ’ she said			2
she denied she had been out of control , impolite or threatening			0
‘ i was upset at being accused of assaulting an old lady			0
i would expect a police officer to be fair and to listen to both sides and i do n’t think she [ @entity93 ] did , ’ miss @entity5 said			1
a spit hood similar to the one used on @entity106 who claimed it made her feel like she was being ' paraded in stocks ' @entity93 told the court she used her spit hood because of the behaviour of @entity106 , who had refused to identify herself and was ‘ tensing ’ to prevent herself being handcuffed			1
the officer claimed that spit was landing on her face and fleece so she handcuffed miss @entity106 after hooding her			0
defence barrister @entity117 said that under @entity2 regulations the hoods should be used only if an individual ‘ represent a significant risk to the safety of officers ’			1
@entity93 admitted she did not know ‘ fully ’ what the criteria were , adding : ‘ at the time i believed it was the correct thing to do			0
’ @entity127 admitted she did not know the criteria for when to use a spit hood ‘ without looking it up ’ and said she did not see the kick her colleague alleged miss @entity5 had landed on her			1
@entity133 , magistrates said they were ‘ concerned ’ that two frontline officers were unfamiliar with force protocols for use of the hoods			2
@entity139 is believed to be one of only two @entity142 forces using them			0
outside court , miss @entity5 said : ‘ i hope this will result in tighter control and better training for the police , so that this treatment is not meted out so lightly in future			1
hooding is listed amongst tortures by the @entity152 on torture			0
‘ i am lucky that i am articulate and have a good support network – others may not , for them such treatment could be devastating			0
’ a spokesman for @entity2 said : ‘ we did receive a formal complaint about this incident before the court hearing and now the criminal prosecution has finished we will be in touch with the complainant in order to fully look into the matter			2
‘ spit hoods , which were introduced in @entity2 in 2009 , have been used 1,291 times			1
they form part of the personal protective equipment available to operational officers			0
‘ spitting has potentially serious health risks for officers and the public and the hoods provide valuable protection			0
‘ officers receive training and guidance in the use of spit hoods			0
