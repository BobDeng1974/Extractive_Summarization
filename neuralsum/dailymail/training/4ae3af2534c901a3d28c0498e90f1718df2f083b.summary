@entity0 last night threw its weight behind the @entity3 ’s campaign for an automatic block on online porn			1
an ‘ opt - in ’ system , under which access is blocked unless adults specifically say they want to see sexual content , would be a ‘ sensible ’ way forward , the shadow ministers for media and justice declared			1
they say the measure is necessary to prevent children falling victim to a ‘ modern - day form of pollution ’			1
porn fears : just 30 % of parents of porn - watching children knew they had accessed adult material the argument for an opt - in system is underlined by a large study demonstrating that most parents have no idea what their children are looking at on the internet			1
among parents of children who had admitted to researchers that they had looked at adult content , more than two thirds were certain their child had not , or said they did not know			1
in addition , more than a quarter of children admitted ignoring warnings their parents gave them about harmful material on the internet			1
the government is resisting the call for an ‘ opt - in ’ system , preferring a less stringent ‘ opt - out ’ system , whereby users are asked when they set up their internet access whether they wish to have a filter applied			1
but this might apply only to new subscribers to internet service providers ( @entity53 ) , and would rely on parents being responsible and proactive enough to ask for access to be blocked			1
it could also allow children to answer the one - off question themselves if they see it on the computer first			1
in their article , above , shadow media minister @entity61 and shadow justice minister @entity62 say this plan does not go nearly far enough			0
and they say that @entity67 ’s closeness to internet giant @entity68 means that the @entity69 is too ‘ weak ’ to act , concluding : ‘ the prime minister should not put his cronies before the children of this country ’			1
an all - party group of mps , led by the conservative @entity76 , launched the campaign for an opt - in system last week , saying increasing numbers of teenagers were growing up addicted to porn			1
the @entity3 wants the government to unveil a consultation on an opt - in system , and in the meantime to speed up the roll - out of ‘ opt - out ’ filtering systems to internet users			1
miss @entity61 and mrs @entity62 say action is urgently needed because ‘ children are regularly seeing pornography and sometimes being groomed for sex ’			2
they attack culture secretary @entity95 ’s proposal , which involves asking the four major @entity53 to offer new customers the chance to opt out of access to pornography			1
they argue it would be 2017 before the proportion of households included reached 90 per cent			0
they deny claims that an opt - in system would be an attack on civil liberties			1
a @entity110 study has found that of children who told the researchers that they had seen sexual images , 40 per cent of their parents said they were certain their child had not , and 29 per cent said they did not know			1
just 30 per cent knew that their child had seen porn online			1
and 26 per cent of children said they ignored their parents ’ warnings on internet safety			1
opt - in : @entity0 threw its weight behind the @entity3 's campaign for an automatic block on online porn the study added that middle - class children were more likely to access porn online than those from poorer backgrounds , because they are more likely to have computers in their own rooms			1
study leader @entity133 said : ‘ i think that parents can be quite embarrassed to ask about anything sexual that children encounter on the internet			1
‘ what they should do is find a way to have a conversation with their children so it seems like sharing , not snooping			2
’ she found that 22 per cent of boys aged 13 to 16 and 13 per cent of girls had seen sexual images online			0
and 2 per cent of 11 - to 16 - year - olds said they had seen violent sexual images			2
a spokesman for @entity68 said : ‘ laws alone ca n’t teach kids to cross the road			2
the same is true of learning to be safe online			0
we work with government and child safety organisations to promote sensible legislation , and have developed technology , including @entity160 and the @entity161 , that parents can use to protect their children online			1
we all have a role to play			0
’ by @entity62 and @entity61 @entity164 was 17 when she was lured to her death by 32 - year - old convicted rapist @entity164			2
although a registered sex offender , he was able to use @entity167 to persuade @entity164 to meet him , and went on to rape and murder her			0
@entity62 pretended to be a teenage boy and told @entity164 his father would pick her up in his car			0
his grooming took place over several weeks			0
lured to death : @entity164 , 32 , raped and murdered @entity164 , 17 , right , after grooming her online this is one of many stories that demonstrates that currently we do n’t have the right safety precautions online for our children			2
the police , parents , schools , internet and website providers and young people themselves all need to take their share of responsibility			2
in government @entity0 said we would give the industry another chance to tackle the problems on a voluntary basis			1
but we warned that if this did n’t produce significant improvements we would step in			0
more than two years on , as last week ’s all - party report shows , things have got worse			2
children are regularly seeing pornography and sometimes being groomed for sex			2
@entity95 is trying to persuade us that his ‘ @entity203 ’ policy is enough			0
under this , four major internet service providers ( @entity53 ) offer new customers the opportunity to opt out of access to pornography			2
the problem is that this scheme will not reach many customers straight away , and wo n’t even hit the 90 per cent mark until 2017			0
in the meantime sales of tvs with internet access are rising and expected to overtake conventional @entity215 next year			2
then even more children will be one click from the strongest material			2
this is why the @entity222 ’s recommendation that the @entity53 are required to move to an opt - in system for adults to see pornography is sensible			1
we know this is possible : it is the technology schools use and the way @entity231 will operate its wifi during the @entity233			0
currently , most of the @entity53 require customers who want to put filters on to their computers to download the software themselves			0
backing online porn opt in : @entity240 @entity62 , shadow minister for justice , and @entity61 , @entity242 but most of us are not geeks – and when one of us tried , all that happened was that the computer was disabled for 24 hours ! the problem @entity164 faced was that the anonymity of the web gave cover to a sex offender			2
at no point was he asked to register his ip or email address with police			0
he was never asked to disclose his online identity and his use of the net was completely unchecked			0
it ’s not just our law enforcers who need to monitor the online activities of sex offenders , @entity167 refuses to act too			2
they have resisted calls to install a panic button for users who become suspicious of the true identities or behaviour of other users			0
social networking sites need to step up and become full partners in the battle to keep our children safe online			0
righting these wrongs is not an attack on civil liberties			1
adults will still have the choice to access material they want to see			0
but in a civilised society we must also protect our children			0
what we want to see is the same balance of rights and responsibilities as we have in the real world			0
undoubtedly , doing this would cost the industry some money – and not just putting in place new filters			0
the search engines such as @entity68 sell advertising on the back of the number of hits any website gets , so the more hits ( and porn sites get plenty ) the more they can charge for advertising spots			1
of course it is the government ’s job to encourage business , but this is not the same as ignoring the needs and wants of ordinary people			0
some 80 per cent of people ( and 93 per cent of women ) think this is a problem			0
children accessing porn on the net is a modern - day form of pollution			1
in 1959 the @entity322 introduced the @entity323 to cut harmful pollution from old smoke stack industries			0
are they now too weak to act and hold the ring between powerful vested interests and ordinary people ? we saw on tuesday at the @entity331 how @entity95 was prepared to do @entity333 ’s bidding and we fear the government has got into the same weak position with @entity68 and the @entity53			1
mr @entity67 employed @entity336 , whose wife is a top executive at @entity68			1
but he has failed to answer the questions we have put to him about mr @entity336 ’s conflict of interest and influence on policy			0
the prime minister should not put his cronies before the children of this country			0
@entity62 is mp for @entity348 and shadow minister for justice			0
@entity61 is mp for @entity350 and @entity242 .			0

@entity0 say @entity67 's closeness to internet giant @entity68 mans the government are too ' weak ' to act
@entity357 group calling for an ' opt in ' to porn system - and deny it would be an attack on civil liberties
just 30 % of parents of porn - watching children knew they had accessed adult material
