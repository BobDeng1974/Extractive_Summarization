@entity0 delivered a devastating critique of @entity3 ’s domestic failings by accusing players of lacking fight and ‘ hiding ’ during yesterday ’s historic home defeat to @entity7			1
@entity7 returned to the top of the table after their first competitive win at @entity11 since 1938 , with scrutiny of @entity13 set to intensify after his team were booed for failing to respond to @entity16 ’s strike early in the second half			1
@entity3 , who fell to sixth after their first home loss in the league since november 2012 , are now six points off the pace – albeit with a game in hand			1
but while @entity13 insisted he was far from worried by league form , skipper @entity0 spared no - one in his post-match appraisal , declaring : ‘ people were just hiding and it was disappointing to see and play in			1
i ’m not laying the blame at everybody else because we ’re all in this together as a team			1
‘ we missed a few chances but at the end we did n’t deserve anything , to be perfectly honest			2
we did n’t play as well as we should have			2
we did n’t have enough movement and there were n’t enough people wanting the ball			2
’ asked if he ’d seen players ‘ hiding ’ before , @entity0 insisted : ‘ not as bad as today			2
we tried to play but @entity7 pressed us high up the pitch and teams do n’t do that at @entity11			1
we should be pressing teams high up the park - that ’s what should be happening and it has n’t happened			1
‘ i definitely understand the frustrations of the fans			2
it ’s not just the fans - those are my own frustrations as well			1
everyone in that dressing room should be devastated with that result			2
@entity16 ( r ) scored the winner to take newly promoted @entity7 top of the @entity69 ‘ it ’s been almost two years since we lost a league game at home and we wanted to keep that run going - but we did n’t do ourselves justice at all			1
‘ i do n’t know how we never got going			2
i would love to tell you because i would be a great manager if i knew that			0
at the end of the day , we were n’t good enough			0
‘ it looked like we had given up fighting , we were second to balls , we did n’t have enough upfront and it just was n’t good to watch			0
’ @entity16 celebrates after his goal gave @entity7 a first win at @entity11 for 78 years manager @entity13 ( @entity83 ) speaks to @entity0 as he continues to struggle during his debut season a clearly angry @entity0 added : ‘ i am devastated			1
i do n’t do getting beat			0
i came to @entity3 to win games and we ’re not winning games and performing just now - and i do n’t know why that is			1
‘ we ’re just not doing it as a team and as individuals			0
we ’re just waiting for somebody like @entity92 ( commons ) to score a wonder goal from 30 yards and then we ’ re all happy - but that does n’t happen every week			1
we have to play and work hard			0
’ asked if new manager @entity13 was getting the message across to players , many of whom are new arrivals at the club , the @entity97 midfielder said : ‘ he is getting there slowly			0
@entity7 manager @entity107 ( @entity108 ) compared the victory to ' @entity110 ' ‘ it ’s not about the manager			1
it ’s also about the players			0
we need to deliver and , if we do that , then it gives the manager time as well			0
i know myself that when i first came here i did n’t realise how big a club it is			0
now the players have to realise this is a huge club			0
' you look at the fans and i can understand why they were booing			0
we do n’t want that			0
we should be entertaining them and we are n’t doing that just now			0
