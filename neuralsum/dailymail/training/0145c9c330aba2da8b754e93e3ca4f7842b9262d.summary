they are more commonly seen as a cause of global warming - releasing clouds of methane as they digest their food			0
but new research suggests that cows may also provide a way of helping to relieve climate change in the future			0
biologists have found that by tweaking the way in which cattle graze in fields it is possible to cut the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by trapping it in the soil			1
rotating herds through many fields prevents the grass from being cropped too short like in the image above the researchers used a technique called adaptive multi-paddock grazing management , which involves using small - sized fields that are grazed for only short periods of time			1
cows and other livestock account for roughly 20 per cent of the world 's methane emissions			0
methane is a potent greenhouse gas that warms the atmosphere many times more rapidly than carbon dioxide , although is far shorter lived			1
ruminants like cows produce large amounts of methane due to the way they use bacteria in their stomachs to digest plants			0
they give off the gas in belches and wind			0
a government funded study has shown that changing the diet of cows could help to reduce their flatulence and so help tackle global warming			2
giving rapeseed to cows reduces the methane content of their belches and wind by up to 20 per cent - while sheep fed on oats generate a third less gas			0
the fields are then given a long period to recover before they are grazed again , allowing plants to grow longer roots and store carbon dioxide from the air in their tissues			1
as they die , the carbon stored in the plants then becomes trapped in the soil			2
the method mimics the natural migration of wild herd animals such as elk , bison and deer			1
@entity86 , a professor of practice at @entity89 's school of sustainability and filmmaker , said some ranchers already use the practice to rejuvenate their land			0
he said : ' what they did not know is that they were helping capture a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the air			1
' current methods used to capture and store carbon are industrial in nature and expensive			0
adaptive grazing is a natural technology			2
' ranchers who use the technique are earning more , becoming financially healthy			0
' professor @entity86 , who directed the documentary @entity109 in 2011 , will lead a team of researchers to study and compare 36 ranches in four areas around the @entity114 and southern @entity115			2
gas from livestock like the cows above account for 20 per cent of the world 's annual methane emissions there have been a number of trials to combat the methane gas produced by cows , including this one by the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 that aims to collect their emissions they will build on work by dr @entity134 at @entity135 that found that adaptive multi-paddock grazing could sequester an additional 30 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare over 10 years compared to conventional grazing			1
with multi-paddock grazing , fields become dominated with taller and more productive grasses than those where grazing is done continuously			1
dr @entity134 found that the soil is more fertile , holds more water and contains more carbon from dead organic matter on ranches that use multiple fields for each herd			1
the technique involves allowing a herd to graze a pasture lightly for up to three days before allowing it to recover by between 30 to 90 days			1
however , the technique does require large areas of land and will not be ideally suited to all parts of the world			0
in the trials , some of the ranches rotated their herds through 48 different paddocks			2
dr @entity134 said : ' the use of multiple paddocks per herd on commercial ranches spreads grazing over the entire landscape in the numerous smaller paddocks , rather than allowing a concentration of grazing pressure on preferred areas in the landscape			0

@entity114 *scientists* are to conduct *widespread* trials of a new farming technique
it is called adaptive multi-paddock grazing and moves herds every 3 days
the method mimics the migratory grazing patterns of wild bison and deer
grass and *shrubs* in the fields are given up to 90 days to recover and grow
this helps to trap carbon dioxide from the air in the plant and in the soil
tests have shown it can remove an extra 30 tons of *co2* for every hectare
