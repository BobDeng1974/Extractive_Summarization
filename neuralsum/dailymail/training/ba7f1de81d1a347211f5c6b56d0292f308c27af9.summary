by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 16:00 est , 18 july 2012 car owners could be traced and fined for litter seen thrown from their vehicles under new plans the sight of cigarette butts , crisp packets and other kinds of litter being thrown out of car windows is a sadly familiar one			1
but under tough new plans to clampdown on litterbugs , car owners could be traced and fined up to £ 80 for any rubbish thrown from their vehicle - whether they were driving at the time or not			1
bringing those responsible for littering from cars to justice is currently a tall order for councils who often struggle to prove who the perpetrator was			0
if introduced , the new proposals - tabled in the @entity26 - will enable them to pursue vehicle owners who can then be handed a penalty or required to name the person responsible			2
they will be liable even if they have no idea who threw the rubbish			2
@entity36 currently has some of the most rubbish - strewn roads in @entity38 , which councils in @entity39 alone spend more than £ 860 million a year to clear up			1
last year , nine million drivers threw litter from their cars			2
lord @entity43 has introduced a @entity44 to get the law changed so that councils can try to recoup some of the cash they spend cleaning up litter by issuing fines directly to car owners			1
he also wants councils to report to the public each year on how much they have spent on contracts for clearing rubbish and which streets they clean in order to make the process more accountable			1
@entity36 's streets are currently some of the dirtiest in @entity38 the public would then be able to complain direct to councils and contractors if their streets were still dirty			1
the plans have been backed by environment secretary @entity66			0
@entity68 cameras could be used by councils to enforce the new law , while fines would also be issued by @entity72			0
@entity73 it : car owners could be traced and fined if litter is seen being thrown from their vehicle councils in @entity78 already issue £ 100 for littering from cars but this could be extended to the rest of @entity39			1
littering is a criminal offence which can lead to a fine of £ 2,500 if taken to court			0
councils also hand out fixed penalty notices of up to £ 80 to those caught dropping rubbish in the street			2
' nothing degrades a road more than litter , ' @entity43 told the @entity94			0
' the roads in @entity39 are some of the dirtiest in @entity38			1
and it can so easily be dealt with			0
' @entity98 author @entity97 , a former president of the @entity99 , last month described the country 's roads as ' an informal linear tip. ' the @entity103 has also welcomed the bill which @entity43 hopes will be adopted and brought into law as quickly as possible			0
he told the @entity94 , ' i want action , not words			0

car owners would be liable even if they do *n't* know who dropped the litter
@entity36 's streets are among dirtiest in @entity38
@entity117 's spend £ 860 million clearing up rubbish
