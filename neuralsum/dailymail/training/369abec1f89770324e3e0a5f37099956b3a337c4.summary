by @entity0 last updated at 2:35 pm on 18th october 2011 two @entity1 are being questioned by an anti-terror unit in @entity3 today after they were arrested near the border with @entity5			1
the pair are believed to be from @entity7 and are @entity1 citizens , although police said one is of @entity5 descent and the other @entity12			1
@entity13 , deputy spokesman for the @entity3 police , said : ' they were arrested crossing into @entity5			1
they are under investigation by the anti-terrorism unit of the @entity3 police			1
' two @entity1 are being questioned by an anti-terror unit in @entity3 today after they were arrested near the border with @entity5			1
@entity3 troops , meanwhile , are pushing towards the strategic @entity5 town of @entity22 ( file picture ) @entity24 have been in contact with officers in @entity3 to try to obtain more information about why the pair were detained			1
a statement from the force said : ' officers are currently in liaison with the @entity3 authorities in respect of two @entity1 nationals who have been detained near to the border with @entity5			1
' the identities of these persons have yet to be formally confirmed , both are believed to be from the @entity7 area ... the force is liaising with local law enforcement to establish the circumstances of their detention			0
a @entity46 spokesman said : ' we are aware of reports of two @entity1 nationals detained in @entity3 on october 16 and we are seeking normal consular access			2
' the arrests come after six weeks during which @entity5 gunmen have kidnapped four @entity53 and killed a fifth inside @entity3			2
this led @entity3 forces to move into @entity5 en masse over the weekend			1
the push by @entity3 ground forces towards the strategic @entity5 town of @entity22 has been slowed by heavy rain , a military spokesman said today			1
warning : @entity63 spokesperson @entity62 yesterday threatened @entity3 during a news conference in @entity65 as @entity3 's defence and foreign ministers arrived in @entity65 for talks , @entity3 troops and @entity71 government forces are heading towards the town just north of the port city of @entity74 , where the militant group @entity63 is entrenched			2
major @entity75 said @entity3 forces were at the @entity5 town of @entity78 , about 50miles from @entity22			1
residents of @entity22 yesterday reported that @entity63 fighters were leaving as the troops approached , although @entity82 said progress has been slowed by rain			0
@entity85 , a commander with the pro-government @entity87 militia , said : ' our troops are heading to @entity22 now , and we expect to capture it either today or tomorrow			0
' in @entity65 , @entity3 's ministers of defence and foreign affairs were to meet with the leaders of @entity5 's @entity95 , said government spokesman @entity96			2
@entity3 forces moved en masse into @entity5 over the weekend , following a declaration on saturday by @entity3 leaders that the country had the right to defend itself			1
mr @entity96 said previously that @entity3 troops were not needed in @entity5 's south			2
@entity63 fighters display weapons as they conduct military exercises in northern @entity65 , @entity5 , recently @entity63 yesterday denied involvement in the abductions , and warned @entity3 of terrorist attacks on its soil unless its forces retreat			1
the group threatened to bring down @entity112 skyscrapers and referenced the july 2010 bomb attacks they masterminded in @entity114 , @entity115 , that killed 76 people			0
@entity63 said the attacks were retaliation for @entity115 's troops contributions to the @entity121 peacekeeping force in @entity65			0
' remember what happened in @entity115 's capital , ' sheik @entity62 , an @entity63 spokesman , said			0
although @entity3 said the kidnapping attacks were the catalyst for the invasion , there are indications the push into @entity5 has been in the works for some time			1
military analysts say it is highly unlikely @entity3 could organise such a complex military operation so quickly in response to the kidnappings			0
the @entity3 invasion comes at a time when @entity63 has been weakened by famine in its strongholds , has been pushed from the capital of @entity65 by @entity121 troops and finds itself increasingly challenged by clan militias			0
@entity3 moved two battalions of about 800 troops each across the border in two locations , a @entity112 - based official said			0
tanks , helicopters and artillery have also been deployed			0
the invasion is the most significant foreign deployment of the @entity3 military since independence from @entity1 in 1963			2
@entity3 's final objective remains unclear			0
it has spent the last two years pushing for a buffer zone between it and troubled @entity5			0
@entity3 forces trained and equipped the so - called @entity159 militia of more than 2,000 @entity5 and have frequently said they want to take @entity74 , a port city whose customs revenues are the insurgency 's biggest cash cow			2
@entity63 's key line of defense for @entity74 is in front of the @entity167			0
there are only three bridges across it strong enough to take the movement of vehicles .			0

the pair are believed to be from @entity7
@entity3 police said they are @entity1 although one is of @entity5 descent and the other @entity12
@entity3 and @entity5 forces both push towards strategic @entity5 town of @entity181
