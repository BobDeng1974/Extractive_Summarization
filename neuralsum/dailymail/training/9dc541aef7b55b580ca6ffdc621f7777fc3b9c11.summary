thirty - eight years ago a sixth - grade class in @entity1 , @entity2 , buried a time capsule in front of their elementary school 's science room , expecting to find it again one day			1
but their hopes of digging up old memories decades later proved difficult to realize - when none of them could find the capsule again			1
the group of classmates came back to @entity17 last weekend , armed with shovels and determined to find what the buried			1
a little to the left ? the former classmates at @entity17 , @entity22 , @entity2 , could n't find their old capsule but despite digging a huge pit outside of the school buildings they remember so well , the 1976 capsule was nowhere to be found , @entity24 reported			1
enthusiastic diggers milling around the schoolyard were heard saying ' we know it 's here somewhere ' , while digging up an ever - wider section of the grass			2
they were keen to discover what the capsule holds , as none of them can remember			2
they were encouraged to stash away their memories of the ' 70s by their old science teacher , mr @entity42 , who died this year			0
' i 'm sure it 's around here somewhere ' : one classmate speaks to a news crew about their ill - fated attempt but eventually the class , now aged around 50 , gave up on their search			1
one digger , @entity53 , told @entity54 : ' we 've really circled it			0
we really thought we 'd find it within a few minutes			0
' another added : ' we do know it 's here though - because that 's the science room and ... it 's just out here			0
' a third suggested it may have sunk deeper into the earth			0
the group reportedly plans to make another attempt soon .			0

*ex-classmates* , now 50 , *returned* to @entity1 , @entity2 , to dig up capsule from 1976
@entity70 was nowhere to be found on the grounds of @entity17
after digging a much *bigger* hole than expected , they gave up searching
