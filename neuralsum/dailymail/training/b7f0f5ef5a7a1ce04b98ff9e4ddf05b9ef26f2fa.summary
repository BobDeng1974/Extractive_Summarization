while many people might enjoy looking out at a storm while huddled up inside their house , farmer @entity0 is not one of them			1
that 's because the 40 - year - old has a herd of 340 cattle to protect , and worries that they could be killed if they are hit by lightning			1
so when she checked on the animals after a recent storm and found them all safe and well , she celebrated the occasion by taking a selfie with one of her favourites			2
farmer @entity0 , 40 , took this selfie with one of her cows while checking on the herd after a storm and realising they had all survived the 18 month - old @entity25 heifer nuzzled up to @entity0 ’s shoulder as she took the snap at her farm in @entity29 , @entity30			1
she said : ' this little heifer is my baby princess , we love to have a natter in the mornings			0
this photo was extra special as i was so worried about all our cattle out in the lightning			2
' they tend to bunch together when frightened under trees and it has been known that if tree gets struck it will kill most of them and she is in a bunch of 40 others			0
' i ca n’t ever get around to check them quick enough after a storm as they are my babies and i would be broken if i found them hurt , dead or dying			0
' all were fine thank goodness so i am very happy			0
' ms @entity0 said cows often shelter in large groups underneath trees while frightened , and so are vulnerable to lightning jumping from the tree and into their bodies			1

@entity0 - @entity0 , 40 , was checking on 340 - strong herd after storm
she was worried that some cows could have been hit by lightning and killed
but when she *discovered* animals were *unhurt* she took a selfie to celebrate
