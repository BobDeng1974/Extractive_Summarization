taking aspirin for 10 years could more than double the risk of sight loss , according to a new study			1
scientists say taking aspirin could increase the chance of developing wet age - related macular degeneration ( @entity7 ) - an eye disorder that can lead to blindness			1
a team from the @entity11 used data from the @entity13 on age - related eye diseases			2
the volunteers , aged 43 to 86 , were then asked if they had regularly used aspirin at least twice a week for more than three months			2
the average duration of follow - up was 14.8 years			0
for the study , the researchers measured the incidences of different types of @entity7			2
@entity7 makes up just 10 per cent of cases but causes severe vision loss , while dry @entity7 is more common and milder - although it can develop into wet @entity7 at any time			1
results showed there were 512 cases of dry @entity7 and 117 cases of wet @entity7 over the course of the study for journal @entity46			1
an eye affected by wet @entity7			1
it causes rapid central vision loss , which can not be restored treatment : @entity7 can be treated with radiation beam that burn abnormal blood vessels behind the retina of eyes the researchers found those who took aspirin for 10 years had a 1.4 per cent risk of developing wet @entity7 compared to just 0.6 per cent of non-users			1
there was no association found between taking aspirin and developing dry @entity7			1
dr @entity62 said : ' aspirin use in the @entity64 is widespread , with an estimated 19.3 percent of adults reporting regular consumption , and reported use increases with age			0
' the results of cross-sectional studies of aspirin use and its relation to age - related macular degeneration ( @entity7 ) have been inconsistent			2
dr @entity62 said there was a small but statistically signficiant association between aspirin use and wet @entity7 ' @entity7 is a potentially blinding condition for which prevalence and incidence are increasing with the increased survival of the population , and regular use of aspirin is common and becoming more widespread in persons in the age range at highest risk for this disease			1
' therefore , it is imperative to further examine this potential association			0
' our findings are consistent with a small but statistically significant association between regular aspirin use and incidence of neovascular @entity7 ( wet @entity7 )			1
' the most common cause of blindness in the elderly , age - related macular degeneration affects a quarter of over- 60s in the @entity24 and more than half of over- 75s			0
the team said further research would be needed to confirm the findings			0
if true it could help develop ways to prevent wet @entity7			1
aspirin is often referred to as a wonder drug			0
besides acting as a painkiller aspirin acts as an anti-inflammatory agent			0
the pill thins the blood and a low daily dose of 75mg has been found to reduce the risk of clots forming in the blood			0
research suggests the benefits of taking a daily aspirin outweigh the small risk of side - effects in patients with heart disease , although a doctor should always be consulted			2
a series of studies involving 200,000 patients found the pill also cut the risk of dying of cancer by 37 per cent if taken for five years			0
however , haemophiliacs and those with ulcers should not take it			0
nor should children under 16 as it has been linked to an often fatal condition called @entity139 's syndrome .			0

scientists say taking aspirin for a decade could increase the chance of developing wet @entity7
the condition causes *swelling* and *bleeding* *underneath* the macular , at the back of the eye
this can cause *permanent* vision loss
