by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 23 july 2013 we all know skin can burn in the hot sun - yet few people realise their eyes are also vulnerable			2
sometimes they will actually hurt immediately after sun exposure , but more often damage accumulates over the years , leading to sight problems			2
the ultraviolet rays from the sun - in particular uvb , the same spectrum of ultraviolet that causes the skin to burn - are most damaging to the eyes			2
staying cool : @entity0 tries out the @entity18 shades ' the uvb can damage the lens ( which helps focus light ) inside the eye , ' says @entity23 , a senior optometrist at @entity24 in @entity25			1
' the lens is made up of proteins all in a straight line - that is why the lens is clear			2
' uvb causes those proteins to unravel and tangle so the lens becomes cloudy in places - this is a cataract and can develop after years or decades of sun exposure			2
' other long - term damage includes pinguecula , harmless but unsightly yellow fatty deposits in the white of the eye thought to be caused by @entity41 damage to the collagen in the conjunctiva ( the clear coating on the white of the eye )			2
skin cancer of the eyelid is also a risk			2
' a type of skin cancer , basal cell carcinoma , can look like a spot or a sore on the eyelid , and can also occur after sun exposure , ' says mr @entity23			2
' although this wo n't spread to other places it can grow deep into the eyelid and removing a small one can leave a significant mark			2
' a shorter - term problem is photo keratitis - also known as snow blindness - when intense sun kills off the outer layers of the cornea ( the clear part of the eye at the front of the eyeball )			2
' it can happen within a day of intense sun exposure and feels as if there is something burning in your eye , ' says mr @entity23			2
' it can be caused by being alongside water , because the water reflects the rays so you get a more intense dose of @entity41			2
' total protection : @entity0 covers up this will clear within a few days , leaving no long - term damage			1
sunglasses will block @entity41 - if you choose carefully			0
light is measured in nanometeres , with @entity91 rays measuring 320 - 390 nanometres			0
if sunglasses carry a ce mark ( a @entity96 standard of uv protection ) that means they should allow no more than 5 per cent of uv rays below 380 nanometres to get through			1
' the other thing you may see on your glasses is a uv 400 sign - which just means that the glasses should not allow in uv rays below 400 nanometres , ' explains mr @entity23			1
' technically , this means they offer more protection than those with just a ce mark but the difference is minimal and the ultraviolet between 380 and 400 ( which is the @entity41 light ) is not as damaging as the ultraviolet at the lower end of the scale			1
' some glasses are also graded by the darkness of the tint , with four being the darkest and one the lightest , but this is cosmetic and gives no uv protection , says @entity120 optometrist @entity119			1
' we make sunglasses that have @entity41 protection - done by a dip - dyeing process - yet are completely clear			1
' dark tints can be misleading if you do n't check the uv rating			0
' if you have a dark tint your pupil will dilate to let more light in , providing a bigger window to allow uv in than if you had no sunglasses on , ' he says			0
often people assume paying more means sunglasses are better - but do you really need to splash out to protect your eyes ? we asked mr @entity119 to assess a selection of cheap sunglasses to find out			0
the real risk is sunglasses which claim to offer uv protection but do n't - while all the glasses tested had a ce mark , mr @entity143 used a specialist machine to check the amount of uv protection the sunglasses offered			1
we then rated them out of ten			0
@entity18 £ 3 good coverage : @entity18 sunglasses @entity41 protection : 100 per cent against uv rays below 400 nanometres expert comment : uv light can also get to your eye from the sides and the gap between you face and sunglasses - so they should be a good fit			1
they need to sit far back on the bridge of the nose but without being so close they are up against your eyes			0
these provide good broad coverage across the eyes and delicate skin area around the eyes			0
they do n't seem to let too much stray light in at the sides - although how they fit will depend on the shape of someone 's face so try before you buy			1
10/10 @entity183 £ 4.99 decent : new look @entity41 protection : 100 per cent expert comment : these have a big gap around the face where stray light could get in , and a brown - red tint which makes no difference in terms of protection			1
they do have individual pads on each side where they sit on the bridge of the nose and these are often adjustable , so an optician might be able to fit them properly			0
8/10 @entity204 £ 1 @entity204 kids shades : worse than wearing no sunglasses @entity41 protection : 47 per cent left eye , 94 per cent right eye expert comment : this is worrying			1
these glasses have a ce mark yet neither eye of the lenses on these sunglasses block out the recommended minimum of @entity41			1
why there is the variation between the two eyes is hard to say - but probably means one side was dipped less thoroughly than the other			0
these are for kids , who spend more time outside than adults and their pupils tend to be more dilated			0
the tint on these means they would dilate further and allow more uv light in than normal			0
so in a way wearing these is worse than no glasses			1
it 's a shame , because the wraparound shape is good and means little light can stray into the sides			1
another pair of adult sunglasses in the same range had 100 per cent protection , so maybe this pair was not dipped for long enough in the uv coating , but this should have been picked up			1
1/10 so - so : top shop glasses @entity245 £ 14 @entity41 protection : 100 per cent expert comment : the lens offers protection but the shape is not so good			1
there are big gaping holes at the side where stray light could get in , but they do feel quite sturdy			0
7/10 summer living 99p from 99p store @entity257 sunglasses : a good shape , @entity259 - style @entity41 protection : 100 per cent expert comment : these offer good uv protection and are a good shape , a big @entity265 - style that covers a big area of the eye , with only minimal stray light coming in at the sides			1
for the price they are hard to fault			0
10/10 @entity273 £ 19.99 from @entity274 and boots @entity41 protection : 100 per cent expert comment : these @entity279 360 glasses ( this pair are for 18 months to three years ) are great for young children			1
great : @entity283 kids lenses they are flexible - even the front section ca n't bend - so wo n't snap			1
they also have curved arms that fit around the child 's head so they will stay on			2
do n't put children in sunglasses all the time			0
their pupils are naturally a little wider than adults and if they then wear sunglasses this makes the pupils dilate to allow more light in			0
and if you put children in sunglasses a lot - not just when it is a bright sunny day - their pupils will gradually lose tone and wo n't be able to become smaller ( which reduces the amount of light coming in to the eye ) as they should , so as adults they wo n't tolerate bright light well			0
10/10 nice snug fit : boots ' offering boots £ 5 @entity41 protection : 100 per cent expert comment : these are a small design - so do n't protect a big area around the eye unlike some of the others			1
but they are a nice snug fit , going right back on the bridge of the nose and letting little light in at the sides			0
they also feel quite sturdy			0
9/10 @entity327 £ 15 surprisingly effective : @entity327 shades @entity41 protection : 100 per cent expert comment : i am pleasantly surprised by these			1
these have a ce mark and a mark saying they offer uv 400 protection			1
but they feel a little flimsy and are n't a particularly good fit - a lot of stray light can get in around the sides			0
8/10 @entity342 £ 15 @entity41 protection : 100 per cent good deal : @entity342 sunglasses expert comment : these are a good fit , offering good protection around the eye			1
they are mirrored so may reflect some light but they wo n't block more uv			0
they have a dark tint - four - which , as the label warns , means they are so dark they should not be used for driving as they could make it hard to see			0
however , they could be good for a bright day on the beach			0
9/10 so how do cheapies measure up ? ' i 've been pleasantly surprised , ' says mr @entity366			0
' it seems in the vast majority of cases the ce marks can be trusted and manufacturers are taking greater care about the type of sunglass they sell - even at the budget end of the market			0

@entity18 's £ 3 shades offer great protection , and so does @entity380 ' £ 20 glasses
but wearing @entity204 's would be worse than wearing none at all !
