the chancellor was snapped with his finger just visible below his belt while he sniffed a bottle of freshly - pressed cider in @entity5 yesterday there is still 100 days to go before the election – but @entity8 is unlikely to be caught in a more embarrassing pose all campaign			1

mr @entity8 started the day by setting sail on a fishing boat in @entity18 where he posed holding crabs			2
he smiled gleefully as he held up two spider crabs , before tweeting a picture with the caption : ‘ started day in @entity23 with @entity18 fisherman @entity24 who 's been crab fishing here for 40 years			2
’ the chancellor , however , appeared not to have noticed the boat was perhaps unfortunately named ‘ @entity29 ’			0
he then joined the prime minister for a carpentry class in @entity5 , before they both helped make cider			1
mr @entity8 , who has developed a reputation for his regular photo opportunities wearing a hi - viz jacket , joined the prime minister making cider in front of the cameras dressed in a fleece jumper			1
as he took the lead picking up a crate of apples to pour into a machine , mr @entity40 appeared not to want to be left out and hastily asked ‘ do you want a hand ? ’ before taking some of the weight with his hands			0
when someone appeared to question whether it was safe , mr @entity40 quickly replied : ‘ health and safety ? we ’ll be alright ’ , before saying to mr @entity8 : ‘ come on then ’ and tipping the apples into the press			0
after pouring a couple of crates of apples into the machine , the pair tried their hand at bottling the drink			0
mr @entity40 lifted a bottle to his nose remarking ‘ oh that smells very good ’ , before adding ‘ i ’ll try some in a minute ’			0
during the whistle - stop tour of marginal @entity15 constituencies , which is a key battleground with the @entity69 , mr @entity8 said the region had never received the same ‘ political attention ’ lavished on regenerating the north of @entity73			1
mr @entity8 , who has developed a reputation for his regular photo opportunities wearing a hi - viz jacket , joined the prime minister making cider in front of the cameras dressed in a fleece jumper he pledged that the @entity81 would create more than 150,000 jobs and boost the region ’s economy by £ 6.4 billion , adding : ‘ the future is bright in the @entity15			1
’ ‘ our long term plan for the @entity15 is about recognising the value of both its natural beauty and the economic strengths nurtured by the people who live here , ’ he said			2
the chancellor refused to say if he was considering reducing the tax on cider , as he has on beer			2
mr @entity8 told reporters : ‘ i wo n’t give a budget here in @entity5 , but we did freeze cider last time , ’ adding that @entity102 would ensure that the industry is not ‘ clobbered ’			1
the chancellor joined @entity40 emptying apples into a machine that presses them for cider making at @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity5 earlier mr @entity8 helped with an engineering project in a mechanical workshop class during their visit to @entity115 , @entity116 mr @entity8 reiterated that the @entity15 could be the equivalent of the thriving west coast of the @entity119 as he launched the ‘ long - term ’ economic plan			1
mr @entity8 went on to draw comparisons between the @entity15 and the @entity119 west coast : ‘ the west coast has the landscape , the sea , the unique characteristics that makes it a great place to live and visit			2
‘ but it has also built a formidable , world - class reputation in science , technology and universities			0
and the military bases and defence industry have helped to create powerful clusters from @entity137 to southern @entity138			0
’ the chancellor followed in a long line of ministers and political leaders who have seen their careers tarnished by an unfortunate photograph after posing with his finger pointing out from his crotch			1
@entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 have all been caught in bizarre poses			0
mr @entity148 's brother @entity152 saw his leadership ambitions badly damaged after being snapped waving a a banana in 2008			0
this is the unfortunate moment a grinning @entity148 was caught posing with three students making a hand gesture more common with builders @entity40 has also suffered his fair share of embarrassing pictures - including images of him without a shirt , wrapped in a @entity165 towel			2
his credentials as a fit and athletic political leader also took a hit after pictures emerged of him drenched in sweat on a jog near @entity110			0
@entity172 leader @entity148 was widely mocked after being snapped awkwardly eating a bacon sandwich in @entity174 last year conservative leader @entity149 pictured with a pair of horns seeming to come from his head @entity40 was pictured out for a run in out of the back of @entity110 in february last year the then prime minister @entity150 unfortunately placed in front of a sign reading ' @entity183 ' even slick pr operators like @entity185 have been caught in pictures which they wished they had n't			0
