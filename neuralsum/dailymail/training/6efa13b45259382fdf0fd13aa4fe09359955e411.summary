by @entity0 published : 20:12 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 06:05 est , 3 march 2014 pupils should be encouraged by state schools to join a cadet force to improve their character strengths , @entity2 said last night			1
the education secretary wants head teachers to boost children ’s so - called soft skills , such as showing respect , being self - motivated and coping under pressure			1
mr @entity2 said employers demanded these traits , as well as resourcefulness and tenacity			1
mr @entity2 said those in such programmes learn valuable skills it was not enough for teachers to simply concentrate on academic progress – they must help create a workforce with ‘ attractive personal qualities ’ , he added , which could be achieved by promoting more school cadet force units			1
in a speech today to highlight the need for schools to do more to build children ’s character , he was expected to say : ‘ business – quite rightly – points out that it needs workers who possess not just impressive academic qualifications but attractive personal qualities			0
‘ employees need to be self - disciplined , capable of subordinating their own instincts and interests to the needs of the team , responsive and respectful towards others , resourceful under pressure , tenacious and self - motivating			2
the education secretary wants children 's soft skills to be developed to make them more employable ‘ increasingly , they also need to be creative in the face of adversity , quick - thinking when presented with unexpected challenges			2
‘ a central element of our long - term plan for schools is the cultivation of those virtues – character strengths – through activities such as team sports , cadet forces , debating , dance , music and drama			0
it ’s why we ’re expanding the number of cadet forces in state schools			1
’ of the 256 school combined cadet force units in @entity72 , 196 are based at independent schools , with just 60 in the state sector			1
the units can include cadets from the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
the @entity81 provides uniforms , training expertise , equipment and access to military training areas , camps and courses			0
prime minister @entity89 , who was a cadet at @entity90 , has pledged to add 100 state school cadet units by the end of next year			1
mr @entity2 ’s comments come after the @entity94 on @entity95 and the @entity97 think - tank said last month that the development of children ’s ‘ character and resilience ’ was so crucial that teachers should be made to organise after - school clubs			2
in a report , they called for teenagers to receive a school leaving certificate detailing their extra-curricular activities and employability skills			0
the ‘ character and resilience manifesto ’ report said the certificates could show that pupils had gained skills such as the ability to bounce back from setbacks			2
meanwhile , the @entity46 will today also call on all firms to offer apprenticeships for young people , saying concerns that it involved too much red tape had been addressed			0
speaking at the @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126 , he is expected to throw down the gauntlet to businesses and say : ‘ there is no reason why every company in the country should not be offering apprenticeships			0
‘ we set ourselves the challenge of simplifying the apprenticeship programme and making it more responsive to employers ’ needs , so no employer could have any excuse for standing aloof			0
