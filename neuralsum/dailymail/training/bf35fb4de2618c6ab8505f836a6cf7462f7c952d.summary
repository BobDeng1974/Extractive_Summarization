dust devils on @entity1 can grow to the size of terrestrial tornadoes , with a funnel more than 330ft above the surface			1
their smaller counterparts on @entity8 form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air above			1
now , a new study has found that it 's not just their size that sets @entity1 dust devils apart ; they also require a stronger updraft create a similar vortex than on @entity8			1
spinning a dust devil in the thin air of @entity1 requires a stronger updraft than is needed to create a similar vortex on @entity8 , researchers claim			1
pictured is a dust devil reaching above the plain of @entity1 ' @entity29 the discovery could help scientists analyse how dust affects the @entity1 weather system - a piece of information that will impact deep space missions to the red planet			1
' to start a dust devil on @entity1 you need convection , a strong updraft , ' said @entity42 , an atmospheric science graduate student at the @entity43 in @entity44 ( @entity45 )			0
' we looked at the ratio between convection and surface turbulence to find the sweet spot where there is enough updraft to overcome the low level wind and turbulence			0
' and on @entity1 , where we think the process that creates a vortex is more easily disrupted by frictional dissipation – turbulence and wind at the surface – you need twice as much convective updraft as you do on @entity8			2
' dust devils on @entity1 can grow to the size of terrestrial tornadoes , with a funnel more than 330ft ( 100 metres ) wide stretching as much as 12 miles ( 19km ) above the surface ( left )			1
their smaller counterparts on @entity8 form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air ( right ) dust devils and tornadoes are common on @entity1			1
here they have lifted the thin bright dust on the surface of the @entity80 , exposing darker material underneath the team looked for the dust devil sweet spot by combining data from a study of @entity87 dust devils with meteorological observations collected during the @entity90 mission			1
they are now looking at the effects dust devils have on lifting dust into the @entity1 atmosphere , and changing the planet 's climate			1
' the @entity1 air is so thin , dust has a greater effect on energy transfers in the atmosphere and on the surface than it does in @entity8 's thick atmosphere , ' said professor @entity105			1
dust in the @entity1 air cools the surface during the day and emits long - wave radiation that warms the surface at night			2
@entity111 scientists in @entity112 have revealed evidence that suggests there is life on @entity1 based on readings taken by the @entity117 ( shown )			0
they said methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria			0
and at the moment there is no alternative explanation for the spikes in the past few months , conclusive evidence has been found that @entity1 once had water on its surface , but one greater question remains : was there , or is there still , life on @entity1 as well ? scientists may be on the brink of answering that question with an equally conclusive ' yes ' , as convincing evidence has been detected by @entity111 's @entity117			2
an instrument on the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface - and it could be the first alien life ever detected			0
' this temporary increase in methane - sharply up and then back down - tells us there must be some relatively @entity146 source , ' said @entity147 of the @entity148 , @entity149 , and @entity117 science team			0
' there are many possible sources , biological or non-biological , such as interaction of water and rock			0
' previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet			0
but none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden ' venting ' measured at @entity163 , where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago			0
while spotting dust devil tracks is relatively common , catching these whirling dervishes on the @entity1 surface can be tough			2
earlier this year , observations from the @entity171 ( @entity171 ) camera on board @entity111 's @entity172 caught three dust devils in action			2
despite their reputation , they can actually help solar panelled robots on the @entity1 surface			0
for instance , the @entity178 underwent a ' cleaning event ' this year , when a dust devil blew off material stuck to its surface			0
earlier this year , observations from the @entity171 ( @entity171 ) camera on board @entity111 's @entity172 caught three dust devils in action			2

on @entity1 , dust devils can stretch up to 12 miles ( 19km ) above the surface
they form when heating of the ground causes a warm layer of air rising through the more dense layers of air above
scientists used meteorological data with information from @entity90 lander
they found that *due* to the @entity1 atmosphere , twice as much wind is needed to create the dust devils
this could help scientists analyse how dust affects @entity1 ' weather system
