if using your age , gender and marital status was n't enough for companies to show you highly targeted ads , @entity0 has filed plans to use your emotions , too			1
the patent , filed by the firm earlier this month , proposes a system that uses ' mood - associated characteristics ' to determine how a user is feeling and show the most appropriate adverts			1
this includes analysing which apps they ’re using , websites they 've visited , whether it 's a national holiday or not , as well as heart rate and facial expressions			1
an @entity0 patent has proposed a system that uses ' mood - associated characteristics ' to determine whether a user is happy , pictured , sad , angry and so			1
they can then show the most appropriate adverts			0
this includes analysing which apps they 're using , websites they 've visited , heart rate and facial expressions if a user , for example , has been playing game apps and watching funny videos on @entity37 , @entity0 could infer that they are happy , or in a positive frame of mind			1
the adverts shown could not only be personalised , based on the type of video or game , they could also be light - hearted and have a ' positive tone			0
' similarly , the system could take into account external factors to determine the mood			2
on national holidays , or the user 's birthday , the inferred mood of the adverts could be lifted , while following a tragedy , or if the user has been planning a funeral , for example , the mood could be ' downgraded			1
' it could also be downgraded if the user listens to love songs , ballads or emo music , as an example			0
@entity0 could even record how much pressure is applied to a device 's screen , in a bid to gauge anger or stress levels			0
the patent is called ' inferring user mood based on user and group characteristic data '			2
@entity0 's system would work on the current principle used in personalised and targeted advertising on websites			2
currently , if users allow cookies to track them around the web , companies can show related adverts on other webpages , because they know what kind of products the user is interested in			0
for example , if a user is searching for a holiday , the adverts will promote holidays , flights and other related travel products or services			0
yet @entity0 's system would take this a step further , by using a person 's mood to personalise the adverts			1
if a user , for example , has been playing game apps and watching funny videos on @entity37 , @entity0 could infer that they are happy , or in a positive frame of mind			2
the adverts shown could not only be personalised , based on the type of video or game , they could also be light - hearted and have a ' positive tone			0
' similarly , the system could take into account external factors that may determine the mood			0
on national holidays , or the user 's birthday , the inferred mood of the adverts could be lifted , while following a tragedy , or if the user has been planning a funeral , for example , the mood could be ' downgraded			2
' the patent also states other physical characteristics could be used to establish a person 's mood , such as blood pressure , perspiration rate , body temperature and movement			1
this suggests the technology could be used in any wearable technology the firm releases , including its rumoured @entity135 , concept pictured it could also be downgraded if the user listens to love songs , ballads or emo music , as an example			0
this patent image shows the proposed process of gathering clues to the user 's mood , and serving appropriate adverts elsewhere , the patent states physical characteristics could be used to establish a person 's mood , such as ' heart rate ; blood pressure ; adrenaline level ; perspiration rate ; body temperature ; vocal expression , movement characteristics and facial expressions			1
' this means the technology could be used in @entity0 's phones and tablets , as well as any wearable technology the firm releases in the future , such as its rumoured @entity135			0
the facial expressions , in particular , could be recorded using a phone 's camera			2
@entity0 's system could even record how much pressure is applied to a device 's screen , in a bid to gauge anger or stress levels			0
according to the patent , discovered by @entity179 : ' ‘ mood - associated characteristics can define characteristics indicative of a user 's mood at a point in time			1
' mood - associated behavioral characteristics can include sequence of content consumed , e.g. sequence of applications launched , rate at which the user changed applications ; social networking activities , pressure applied to a touch screen , and / or emotional response to previously served targeted content			1
' mood - associated spatial - temporal characteristics can include location , date , day , time , and / or day part			2
' the patent proposes creating a ' baseline mood profile ' that will help to create profiles for each emotion			0
a ' confidence score ' will then be used to estimate the mood			0
@entity0 does explain that the system would be opt - in , and opt - out , and the patent has only been filed - it has not been awarded .			1

patent describes @entity0 ’s plans to serve content based on a person ’s mood
system would use ‘ mood - associated characteristics ’ to establish emotions
this includes which apps *people* use , websites they ’ve visited as well as heart rate and facial expressions
the system could also take into account national holidays , for example
patent continues that users would be able to opt out of the proposed system
