this astonishing collection of photographs was discovered in a rusty metal box by @entity3 , 71 , in the home of his late grandfather , @entity5 , who was a sapper in the @entity8 between 1914 and 1919			1
he captured the rare images while he was stationed in northern @entity10			1
he worked with the @entity11 who were tasked with supplying communication lines towards @entity14 and upgrading trenches			2
@entity5 's pictures provide a unique glimpse into life on the @entity19 in the final 18 months of the @entity20			2
he captured the aftermath of @entity23 offensives , including the @entity24 , and took photos of the devastation and desolation of villages which were razed in the path of armies from both sides during the conflict			1
@entity3 , who lives in @entity33 , spent four years trying to get the images developed			2
after painstaking work , 40 of the 50 pictures were salvaged along with @entity5 ’s diary			0
destruction : the previously unseen images paint a unique portrait of life on the @entity19 in the final months of the @entity20 , portraying the damage that was inflicted on buildings in the north of @entity10 , near to the border with @entity14 ruins : the photographs , which were taken by @entity8 sapper @entity48 , showed how villages were left devastated by shelling with churches and houses being being left in ruins by both the @entity23 and the @entity55 forces desolation : a staircase which was once encased inside in a building is left standing after the surrounding walls were destroyed during fighting in the @entity61 region of northern @entity10			1
this area saw huge amounts of fighting and was the first battlefield experienced by @entity23 troops when they travelled across to mainland @entity67 remembering the fallen : @entity68 also took photos of memorials which were constructed in the aftermath of offensives or incursions			0
here , @entity75 troops are remembered underneath a crucifix engraved into the ground with the letters rip written above incursion : the ruins of a building in the city of @entity83 , the location of one @entity23 's most important offences in 1917			0
when the battle officially ended on 16 may , @entity87 troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough escaping the carnage : pictures show thousands of villagers whose homes had been destroyed along the @entity19 carrying their possessions on their backs			0
they left the region searching for a different place to stay while the heavy fighting continued many of the images were taken in the aftermath of the @entity24 in 1917			1
it was was a @entity23 offensive where @entity23 , @entity75 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 troops attacked @entity55 defences near the @entity113 city of @entity83 on the @entity19 boulders : a picture of artillery equipment used surrounded by rubble in the aftermath @entity24			2
mr @entity5 was a was as a ' @entity118 ' ( combat engineer ) in the @entity8 and had 14 military years of experience behind him			1
he was tasked with trench design and the establishment of communications and supply routes , he also had to transport ammo , food and bodies portrait : an image of four soldiers from the @entity130 taken in 1918			0
unlike most @entity8 units , troops in these groups placed a great reliance on the leadership and skills of the non-commissioned officers off the tracks : two soldiers from the @entity140 pose next to a derailed train near the city of @entity83 foreign troops : some of pictures include extremely rare shots of members of the @entity147 who were recruited by @entity23 to help with the war effort			0
around 150,000 @entity150 men and boys , some as young as 14 , were recruited from the provinces and shipped to the front line from 1915 to provide a labour force for the @entity155 model : mr @entity158 's probable camera was a @entity160 no 2 @entity159			0
the first model produced in 1900 was made out of a cardboard box with a simple meniscus lens that took 2¼ - inch square pictures on 117 rollfilm			0
the photos were then developed by @entity158 , @entity5 's great - grandson , who spent five years putting together the collection at his home in much @entity169 , @entity33 road into @entity10 : a typical tree - lined , cobbled road in @entity61 which was the first sight to greet @entity23 troops as they made their way across the channel to join in the war effort			1
many had never left the @entity23 and thousands would not return links : a group of soldiers stand in front of a van in @entity61			0
many of the servicemen who mr @entity158 spent his time with were employed to set up lines of communication and upgrade trenches across @entity10 and @entity14 heads up : a solider pokes his head from about a train on a railway in northern @entity10			1
mr @entity5 spent his time in @entity61 , @entity14 and @entity83 in @entity10 travelling along the railways until he returned to @entity23 in 1919 under attack : the city of @entity83 is located in @entity10 on the banks of @entity194			1
@entity195 ( or underground tunnels ) below the city were used throughout @entity20 to hide residents during attacks sending in the cavalry : it has been estimated that many millions of horses were employed by both sides in the conflict and between six and eight million died throughout the duration of the @entity20			0

black and white *negatives* were found by @entity3 , 71 , in the attic of his late grandfather 's home
@entity5 took the photos while he was a combat engineer in the @entity8 between 1914 and 1917
he was stationed in northern @entity10 and spent the *majority* of his time with the @entity11 *companies*
images capture the aftermath of the @entity24 and the destruction caused by both sides in the @entity61 region
they provide a rare insight into the destruction inflicted on villages near the @entity14 border during the conflict
