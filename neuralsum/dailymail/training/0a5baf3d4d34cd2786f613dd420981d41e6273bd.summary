are you someone who posts a status or photo on @entity4 , then checks the site every minute to see how many likes and comments you have ? if so , chances are you 're insecure in your relationships - and you require attention from others to feel better			1
that 's according to a study that found people who had a fear of rejection typically spent more time ' feedback seeking ' on the social network			1
a study by @entity21 in @entity22 found anxious and insecure people spend more time ' feedback seeking ' on @entity4 ( stock image shown )			1
they are more likely to post statuses and check for likes and comments			1
this is done in the hope of getting attention due to a fear of rejection the study was carried out by researchers at @entity21 in @entity37 , @entity22 and published in the journal @entity39			1
it suggests that people who are generally insecure in their relationships are more actively engaged on the social media site - frequently posting on walls , commenting , updating their status or ' liking ' something - in the hope of getting attention			2
selfies and self - indulgent @entity4 statuses suggest we are more narcissistic than ever			0
but researchers have found we actually started to become increasingly self - centred more than 100 years ago			0
by studying unique baby names , birth and divorce rates and the use of words like ' i ' and ' me ' in books , the experts said individualism began rising at the turn of the 20th century			0
and this rise is blamed on a shift from manual labour to office jobs as people became wealthier and better educated			0
individualism is the belief that personal needs are more important than the needs of society as a whole			0
it is said to have first developed among @entity75 , born after @entity76			0
the study covered a 150 - year period and was carried out by researchers from the @entity80 at the @entity81 and @entity82			0
in two surveys of almost 600 people aged 18 to 83 , the researchers at @entity21 asked participants about their tendencies in close relationships , and their @entity4 habits			2
the results suggest there are at least two kinds of active @entity4 users			0
these are people who are higher in attachment anxiety , and people who are higher in extraversion			2
people who were higher in attachment anxiety worry that other people do n't love them as much as they want to be loved , according to the researchers , and are chronically concerned about rejection and abandonment			1
they reported greater amounts of what the study refers to as ' feedback seeking ' on @entity4			1
because these people need a lot of reassurance they are loved , and are very sensitive to other people 's opinions about them , they turn to @entity4 for feedback			2
' compared to more secure people , those higher in attachment anxiety are more feedback sensitive , ' said dr @entity118 , associate professor of psychology and the lead author of the study			1
' they report feeling much better about themselves when they get a lot of comments , likes and other feedback on their posts and worse about themselves when their @entity4 activity generates little attention			2
' do you find yourself checking the site every few minutes ? in the study , anxious and insecure people reported feeling much better when others commented or liked on their @entity4 activity			1
' compared to more secure people , those higher in attachment anxiety are more feedback sensitive , ' said lead author dr @entity118 anxiously attached individuals ' level of feedback sensitivity correlates with how active they are on @entity4 , dr @entity118 said , ' and it appears that this strategy may work : they report receiving more attention than people lower in attachment anxiety			1
' dr @entity118 's co-authors were dr @entity150 , professor of psychology at @entity21 , and former students @entity153 and @entity155			2
previous research on the relation between personality and styles of engagement with social media is limited and has generated mixed results			0
the current study is one of the first to examine the reasons people turn to @entity4 and the kind of engagement they exhibit as a function of their personality style			0
' these studies are consistent with many people 's intuitions that some individuals use @entity4 to fulfill emotional and relationship needs that are unmet in the " real " world , ' dr @entity118 said			1
' there is a robust debate playing out in psychological science and pop culture as to whether @entity4 represents a healthy or unhealthy outlet for such needs			0
' i think the jury 's still out on that , but this research suggests that personality is an important factor to consider when investigating the causes and consequences of people 's engagement with social media			0
