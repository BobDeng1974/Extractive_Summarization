a @entity1 freshman who finished five years of active service in the @entity3 this summer is appealing an @entity5 rule preventing him from playing this season because he played in a recreational league in the military			1
according to @entity9 , the rule essentially says student - athletes who do not enroll in college within a year of graduating high school will be charged one year of collegiate eligibility for every academic year they participate in organized competition			1
by @entity5 standards , @entity16 ' play at the @entity3 base counted as " organized competition " because there were game officials , team uniforms and the score was kept			1
fighting his corner : @entity3 and @entity25 walk - on freshman @entity16 hopes to be granted immediate eligibility by the @entity5 to play this season sitting on the sidelines : @entity16 is not able to play college football this year because he competed in a recreational league during his tenure as a @entity3 but the 6 - foot - 3 , 240 - pound @entity3 sergeant said the recreational league was nothing close to organized			1
' man , it was like intramurals for us , ' said the 24 - year - old			0
' there were guys out there anywhere from 18 to 40 - something years old			0
the games were spread out			0
we once went six weeks between games			0
' the rule first took shape in 1980 , when ' participation in organized competition during times spent in the armed services , on official church missions or with recognized foreign aid services of the @entity56 government ' were exempt from limiting eligibility			2
but through several revisions and branches of the rule , the clause allowing competition during military service was lost and not carried over into the current bylaws			0
@entity5 rule : despite his age , military service and complete lack of college football experience , @entity16 must take a mandatory redshirt and not play for @entity25 this season frustrating decision : @entity16 has been told he will have to sit out this season and forfeit two years of eligibility because his recreational league season spanned two academic years @entity74 , @entity25 's assistant athletic director / compliance , said he does n't believe the @entity5 ever intended to penalize military service members			1
' all this is strictly because of how the bylaw is worded , ' he said			0
' in my opinion , there is no intent of anyone to not allow protection to our @entity56 service members			0
' @entity16 is not able to play college football this year because he competed in a recreational league during his tenure as a @entity90 playing football -- which he will not be able to do this season for @entity25			1
@entity1 won a partial appeal to the @entity5 last week recouping two years of eligibility for @entity16 with his recreational league spanning two academic years			1
but @entity16 still is appealing to play this season practicing both at tight end and defensive end			2
@entity25 spokesman @entity98 told @entity99 on sunday that the school hopes to hear from the @entity5 within the next month			2
the @entity101 open the season aug. 29 hosting @entity103 .			0

@entity1 walk - on @entity16 bid to get on field so far *foiled* by @entity5 rule
hang - up is his participation last year in military - only recreational league in @entity114
school has won appeal to *restore* two years of eligibility but battle to play right away *remains*
