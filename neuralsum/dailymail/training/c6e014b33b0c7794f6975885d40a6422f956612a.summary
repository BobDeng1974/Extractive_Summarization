by @entity0 a woman made four increasingly desperate 999 calls after her husband became ill with chest pains , eventually telling the operator : ‘ it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			1
’ @entity9 , 74 , died of heart failure while waiting almost an hour for an ambulance after paramedics initially refused to attend because they were due a break , an inquest heard yesterday			1
in a string of harrowing calls the retired gardener ’s wife @entity14 , 63 , had begged the emergency service for help for her husband			1
@entity9 , 74 , pictured with wife @entity14 , died at his home , near @entity21 , after the ambulance turned up late by the time paramedics arrived more than 50 minutes after the first call it was too late			1
delays in @entity27 meant paramedics had had to wait up to 99 minutes to hand over patients to hospital staff , and there were no ambulances available			1
when a crew was found they refused to attend because they were due a break			0
only when mrs @entity35 rang to say her husband had died and her 999 call was flagged at the most serious level did they agree to go to her aid			1
@entity39 , coroner for @entity40 , heard that the ambulance service was ‘ extremely busy ’ on the night mr @entity9 died and their response was almost 45 minutes slower than the target time of eight minutes for life - threatening cases			1
mrs @entity35 first called 999 just before 1.10am on march 21 last year after her husband ( pictured ) complained of chest pains at their home the inquest was told by mr @entity9 ’s cardiologist , @entity49 , that he might have survived if paramedics had arrived soon after the first call , but by the time of the second it was unlikely he would have lived			1
mrs @entity35 , a retired civil servant , first called 999 just before 1.10am on march 21 last year after her husband , who suffered from several serious conditions including heart failure , complained of chest pains at their home in @entity58 , near @entity21			1
the operator reassured mrs @entity35 that an ambulance was on the way			1
nine minutes later – at 1.19am – mr @entity9 ’s condition worsened and his wife called 999 again			1
mr @entity9 could be heard groaning as his wife told the operator : ‘ he ’s in very severe pain , he ’s having trouble breathing			1
i just want someone to help			0
’ mrs @entity35 told the hearing : ‘ i could see the panic in his face , the fear in his eyes			0
he kept saying : ‘ ‘ tell them to hurry up ’ ’			0
’ in the third call , 19 minutes later at 1.38am , mrs @entity35 told the operator : ‘ i ca n’t make it any more urgent … i keep phoning back but nothing changes			0
’ soon afterwards her husband stopped breathing and died , mrs @entity35 told the hearing			2
‘ at 1.45am he said he could n’t take any more , ’ she said			0
‘ he said : ‘ ‘ i ’m going ’ ’ and slumped back on the pillow , stopped breathing and just passed away			0
’ she called 999 for the final time , at 1.51am , telling the operator : ‘ this is the fourth time i ’ve rung for an ambulance , it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			1
’ mrs @entity35 told the inquest at @entity89 , @entity90 , that the female operator in the final call showed a ‘ considerable ’ lack of compassion			0
ten minutes after the call three ambulances , two from the @entity96 and one from the @entity98 , arrived at the couple ’s home			1
in a string of harrowing calls mrs @entity35 , 63 , had begged the emergency service for help for her husband in a statement @entity105 , one of the first paramedics to arrive , said they had experienced ‘ considerable delays ’ at the @entity27 department of @entity109 on a previous call when they had waited 99 minutes to hand over a patient to staff			1
they left the hospital at 1.32am and received a ‘ red two ’ call – the second most serious – but had been on shift for six hours without a break , so ‘ politely declined ’ to help			0
paramedics are supposed to receive a 30 minute break every three hours			2
a short time later mr @entity105 and a colleague got a ‘ red one ’ call , the most serious and agreed to forgo their break			2
a statement released last night by mrs @entity35 ’s solicitor said she was ‘ haunted ’ by the 999 calls and was unable to listen to them in court , but she believes her husband was let down by a systemic failure and does not seek to blame any individual			1
@entity35 ( pictured ) begged the emergency services for help for her husband , @entity137 mrs @entity35 : ‘ it ’s my fourth call , i think my husband has just died			1
’ operator asks for her full address mrs @entity35 : ‘ this is the fourth time i ’ve rung for an ambulance , it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			1
’ operator : ‘ are you with him now			0
’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ there ’s not much point now , he ’s dead			2
’ operator : ‘ how old is he ? ’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ he was 74			2
’ operator : ‘ is he awake ? ’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ no ’ operator : ‘ is he breathing ? ’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ no. ’ operator : ‘ alright , what happened ? ’ mrs @entity35 ; ‘ he just could n’t take the pain anymore and could n’t breathe anymore			0
’ operator : ‘ okay , i ’m organising help for you now			0
’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ there ’s nothing i can do now for him , he ’s just lying on the bed			2
’ operator urges mrs @entity35 to help her husband by laying him flat on his back on the floor			0
mrs @entity35 : ‘ i ca n’t do that , there ’s nobody here , he ’s died			1
’ operator : ‘ are there any neighbours that can help you ? ’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ no , there ’s nothing i can do , he ’s dead			2
’ operator : ‘ i can tell you how to help him			0
’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ you ’re too late , i ’m sorry			0
’ operator : ‘ are you wanting to help your husband ? mrs @entity35 : ‘ just let him go			0
he was in pain , i do not want him to suffer			0
it ’s not that i do not want to help him , he ’s gone			2
’ operator : ‘ let ’s help him together			2
’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ i ca n’t he ’s gone			2
do n’t you understand ? i do n’t want to get him back to suffer more			0
’ operator : ‘ when did he stop breathing ? ' mrs @entity35 : ‘ two minutes ago			0
’ operator : ‘ just follow my instructions , you do n’t have to do anything you do n’t want to do			0
’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ i just want someone to come and take him , it ’s nearly an hour … what are your target times ? ’ operator : ‘ what do you mean … we try to get to patients as quickly as possible			1
’ mrs @entity35 : ‘ well , you have n’t succeeded this time			0
