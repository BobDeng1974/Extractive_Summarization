by @entity0 published : 21:55 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 05:50 est , 8 october 2013 @entity1 said on tuesday its military would be put on high alert and be ready to launch operations , stepping up tension after weeks of rhetoric directed against the @entity7 and @entity8 , who it accuses of instigating hostility			1
reclusive @entity1 has often issued threats to attack the @entity8 and the @entity7 but has rarely turned them into action			1
such hostile rhetoric is widely seen as a means to perpetuate its domestic and international political agenda			2
in the latest outburst , a spokesman for the @entity1 's military warned the @entity7 of " disastrous consequences " for moving a group of ships , including an aircraft carrier , into a @entity8 port			1
@entity26 rhetoric : @entity1 leader @entity28 waves during a recent military parade ' in this connection , the units of all services and army corps level of the @entity35 received an emergency order from its supreme command to reexamine the operation plans already ratified by it and keep themselves fully ready to promptly launch operations any time , ' the spokesman said , referring to the @entity35 ( @entity35 )			0
' the @entity7 will be wholly accountable for the unexpected horrible disaster to be met by its imperialist aggression forces ' nuclear strike means , ' the spokesman said in a statement carried by the official @entity46 news agency			1
in march , the @entity1 declared it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended fighting in the 1950 - 53 @entity49 signed with the @entity7 and @entity50 , threatening to use nuclear weapons to attack @entity7 and @entity8 territories			1
on alert : @entity1 's army has been placed on alert after @entity1 's leadership made threats against the @entity7 the @entity57 has defied international warnings not to build nuclear and long - range missiles and is believed to have enough fissile material to build up to 10 nuclear bombs			2
most intelligence analysis says it has yet to master the technology to deploy such weapons			0
the @entity7 , which has 28,500 troops stationed in the @entity8 , regularly engages in drills with its ally , and has said the aircraft carrier @entity70 was leading a group of ships to visit @entity8 in a routine port call			2
not capable : though @entity1 has launched test missiles in the past , it is not believed the country has the technology to fire warheads very far @entity8 's @entity79 said on monday the ships were taking part in a routine maritime search and rescue exercise and said any criticism by @entity1 was ' wrong			0
' the impoverished @entity1 's large but ageing conventional military is considered unfit to fight an extended modern battle but it staged surprise attacks against the @entity8 in 2010 that killed 50 people in aggression unprecedented since the war			0
an attempt at dialogue in august led to the reopening of a jointly run factory park that was shut amid high tensions in april			0
however , talks have since hit a stalemate .			0

the rhetoric is seen more as *bluster* than *foreshadowing*
most analysts doubt the reclusive nation has the technology to threaten @entity7 *interests*
