@entity0 asked hospital staff to call her an ambulance when she was suffering a heart attack - but they told her to call her own a grandmother who had a heart attack outside a hospital walk - in centre was forced to call her own ambulance - because staff were not allowed to , it has been claimed			1
@entity0 , 58 , from @entity9 , went to the town 's @entity10 to get help after she began to feel unwell and matched the symptoms to a previous heart attack			1
but despite begging receptionists to call someone she was refused help and instead told to ring the emergency services herself			1
the grandmother - of - three was then forced to frantically search her bag for her mobile phone before calling ambulance crews for help			1
she was admitted to hospital where she has stayed for the past week in a critical condition after suffering her second heart attack in just six months			1
yesterday ms @entity0 ' furious family hit out at the medical centre , claiming she could have died if she had not had her phone with her			1
@entity30 , her sister , said : ' the whole family is devastated			0
i could have lost my sister			0
would making a free phone call really have harmed them ? ' a medical centre is meant to be the place you can turn to			2
but she had to get help on her own			0
she is full of life and would do anything for anyone			0
she did n't deserve this			2
' she also suffered a serious heart attack in january			1
she was outside the walk - in centre and went to get help			2
she asked a receptionist if they could ring an ambulance as she was having a heart attack			1
' but she said she could n't do that and she would have to ring herself			2
she does n't always have her mobile phone with her			0
if she had n't had it , she would have died			0
' @entity0 had been visiting her sister for coffee at around 8.30am when she began to feel hot			1
she decided to head to the bank before going home when all of a sudden she felt a problem ' building up and up '			0
ms @entity0 immediately recognised the symptoms as the same as those she experienced in january and rushed to @entity9 's @entity10 for help			1
@entity30 , her sister , said : ' the whole family is devastated			0
i could have lost my sister			0
would making a free phone call really have harmed them ? ' the walk - in centre is run by @entity70 and based at @entity10 when ambulance crews finally arrived she was taken to the @entity73 , in @entity74 , where she remains			2
@entity30 added : ' she says she will never forget the face of the woman who said she could n't call her an ambulance			2
i want those responsible to be named and shamed			0
' her grandchildren are all devastated as well			0
' a spokesman for @entity83 doctors @entity70 , which runs the walk - in centre , said : ' our organisational procedures dictate that when any patient presents to the reception , the receptionist will undertake a brief visual assessment of the patient 's presenting condition			1
' they will refer to our organisational urgency criteria which clearly identifies the symptoms associated with patients presenting with emergency , urgent or non-urgent conditions , and the actions to be taken accordingly			1
' therefore , when a patient presents to a receptionist requesting an ambulance , the receptionist will briefly identify the physical presenting condition of the patient and seek immediate clinical advice from one of our gps ; while , if necessary , calling 999			0
' @entity108 , director of operations at @entity110 @entity109 , said : ' we commission urgent care services in @entity112			2
' while we can not comment on individual cases , all our providers are expected to deliver good services and where appropriate , services should signpost and direct patients onwards to other relevant services , and seek appropriate assistance where necessary			0

@entity0 realised she was in *danger* and went to *community* hospital
she begged receptionists to help but they told her to call 999 herself
@entity110 claims ms @entity0 did n't meet ' urgency criteria ' after ' visual assessment '
the grandmother - of - three is still in hospital after suffering a heart attack
