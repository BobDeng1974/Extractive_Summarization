with their glossy locks , unlined skin and youthful good looks , the @entity2 panel putting the contestants through their paces on this year 's show look better than ever			1
but according to one top surgeon , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 may owe their good looks to more than just good genes and expensive skincare			1
although @entity7 's penchant for @entity16 is an open secret as is @entity19 's hair transplant , @entity21 - @entity20 , the non-surgical director at @entity22 , claims that all four have had more than they admit to			1
' looking at the most recent picture , her skin appears very taut , tight and mannequin - like			0
' these are all classic tell tale signs of recent and long term use of injectable treatments			0
' like @entity9 , @entity38 , 31 , who has previously denied having @entity16 , may also have had cosmetic injections and , according to miss @entity20 , has also had some dental work done			1
' her forehead is line free , and her eyebrows are slightly more arched in the recent picture , both of which indicate that she is possibly having injectable treatments , ' explains miss @entity20			0
video courtesy of @entity47 fresh - faced : at 39 , @entity9 looks just as good as she did at 20 - thanks in part to a series of cosmetic jabs ' what strikes me most are @entity8 ’s teeth			1
it seems that she has had veneers and her teeth are far more aligned and brighter now than in older pictures			0
' although it 's widely reported that @entity8 wore @entity63 braces in the past , her current look is possibly the result of extra work , something that the @entity22 director describes as a good investment			1
' [ her teeth ] have most certainly been her best investment and have significantly altered her overall look			0
' but adds miss @entity20 , @entity38 - @entity72 's good looks are n't entirely the work of surgeons			1
' @entity8 has always had great skin , ' she explains			1
' fantastic care and , possibly , minimal use of injectables has resulted in a polished and refined look			0
@entity8 looks her age and fantastic for it			2
' @entity7 , 54 , is also singled out for his enduringly good skin			2
' @entity7 looks great for his age and what a head of hair he has , ' says miss @entity20			2
pretty in her 30s : @entity8 looks her age and fantastic for it says surgeon @entity86 poised : along with better teeth , @entity8 has become more polished and sophisticated over the years ' looking at these pictures , it seems that he ’s also been indulging in some non-surgical treatments of late			1
@entity7 works in a very image based industry - non-surgical treatments are standard for anyone who works in tv and has their picture taken regularly			2
' you ’d expect anyone with this type of work to have a good skincare regime and although it ’s worked for @entity7 , we would always advise people not to overdo it – in particular when it ’s injectables			1
' surprisingly though , it 's the seemingly low - maintenance @entity10 , 62 , who appears to have had the most invasive treatments , with miss @entity20 arguing that his fresh - faced looks are the result of an eye lift			0
@entity19 , who in 2011 admitted to having a £ 30,000 hair transplant , has previously declared himself ' open ' to the idea of having surgery and has said @entity7 has encouraged him to have his eye bags sorted out			2
no change : @entity7 looks great for his age and has n't changed much since this 2002 photo ( right ) improvements : @entity19 has had a hair transplant and possibly eye bag lift so looks great for his age according to miss @entity20 , the @entity127 judge now appears to have taken @entity7 's advice			1
' the more recent pictures also seem to show signs of him having had a blepharoplasty ( an eye lift ) , which is a surgical procedure to remove and tighten the loose skin from the eye area			0
' popular with men of his age , it results in a more youthful and fresher appearance			0
i would expect him to indulge in non-surgical treatments such as @entity16 too , as his forehead is looking smooth and line free			2
' @entity19 , although happy to admit to his hair transplant , has always denied having @entity16 , saying he would ' never stick poison in his face ' and instead putting his youthful looks down to good genes - something that miss @entity20 agrees with			0
' he looks great for his age , ' she added			0
' his overall look is more polished and brighter , which translates well on camera , giving him a much fresher appearance .			0

according to a top surgeon , all four @entity2 judges have had work done
@entity7 's liking for @entity16 is well known and he has also had *fillers*
@entity8 looks like she has had @entity16 and dental work
