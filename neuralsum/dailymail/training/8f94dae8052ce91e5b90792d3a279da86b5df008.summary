' my mum was not in so much pain that she was reeling about on the bed needing morphine , ' said @entity0			0
' she may have been quite ill when she was admitted , but she drastically improved and there was no need to put her on a pathway			2
' she added : ' we should not be allowing hospitals to put people on a pathway if they are not critically ill. by the time my mum was discharged she could walk around and was eating fine			2
