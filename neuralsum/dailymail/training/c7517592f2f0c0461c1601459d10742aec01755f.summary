threat : unite union general secretary @entity1 found to continue using ' leverage ' tactics against employers @entity6 boss @entity1 defied @entity7 yesterday by vowing to continue with ‘ bully - boy ’ tactics against employers after one militant campaigner was caught on tape joking about being branded an ‘ industrial terrorist ’			1
mr @entity1 , the leader of @entity14 , which is @entity16 ’s biggest funder , vowed to continue with controversial protests at the homes of company executives , insisting they told ‘ bad bosses that they have nowhere to hide ’			1
he insisted that so - called ‘ leverage ’ tactics had been demonstrated to work , winning victories for his union in a series of disputes			1
@entity29 , a member of @entity14 ’s campaign team , also defended his part in the bullying tactics employed during the @entity34 dispute , following claims that bosses of the petrochemicals plant in @entity38 were targeted by trade union activists for protests at their homes			1
in a recording of remarks made at meeting of a new union think tank , mr @entity29 said : ‘ i do n’t see anything wrong with it , i wo n’t apologise for it , and i ’ll do it again when i ’m asked to do it			1
‘ i ’m an organiser and this week an industrial terrorist , apparently			2
’ @entity53 has announced that the government is considering tightening the law to prevent cases of industrial intimidation			0
the prime minister told mps he was shocked by allegations that children of executives had had ‘ wanted ’ posters put through their letterboxes , while their neighbours had been told they were ‘ evil ’			1
following the @entity67 ’s revelations about @entity14 ’s activities , mr @entity7 also said : ' i condemn intimidatory tactics			1
it is not how industrial disputes should be conducted			0
’ but yesterday mr @entity1 , whose union has given @entity16 more than £ 8 million under mr @entity7 ’s leadership , vowed not to retreat in the face of what he said were ‘ unscrupulous smears ’ directed at his union			1
he told a @entity14 conference in @entity80 : ‘ every day we read statements and press articles about @entity14 which do not come within hailing distance of the truth			0
‘ this shows one thing above all : @entity14 is making a difference			0
we have served notice on the establishment that fighting trade unionism is back - and the elite do n't like it			0
‘ of course , there is another agenda behind these attacks too			0
we are a proxy for smearing the @entity16 and @entity7 , since the same elite is now worried that a @entity16 government which may itself not play by the old rules is a possibility			0
’ bullying : the @entity67 revealed how @entity14 thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the @entity34 petrochemical plant , pictured , in @entity38 during strike action last month the unite general secretary challenged the prime minister to make recent remarks against the union , outside @entity112 without the cover of parliamentary privilege			1
the protests which had been highlighted in recent weeks were ‘ as old as democracy - free speech and the right to peacefully demonstrate ’ , he added			0
‘ for that , our members have been described as “ thugs ”			0
we will see what the law makes of that phrase			0
‘ it is , at any event , a lie			0
these protests were peaceful , mostly silent , and of course had nothing to do with intimidating families , children , or anyone			1
in more than two years , we have not had a single complaint about our members ' conduct on such protests , nor a single police charge			0
‘ this union is not retreating from leverage , or from the right to peaceful protest			1
‘ the most important thing to say about @entity14 ’s leverage strategy is this : @entity145 has worked			2
leverage has won … ‘ that is why it is now being attacked - because it is working			1
leverage is about telling the bad bosses that they have nowhere to hide , challenging their conduct with shareholders , with clients and customers			2
’ campaign of intimidation : unite militants with their giant inflatable rat outside @entity160 , one of @entity163 's business interests in the @entity164 , during the bitter @entity34 dispute raising the ' levels of hostility ' : the union activists protested at @entity170 sailing club mr @entity29 , a @entity14 organiser in @entity172 and member of the ‘ leverage ’ team that ‘ assisted ’ with the @entity34 dispute , shrugged off criticism of the union ’s tactics by describing it as a ‘ badge of honour ’			1
tactics employed included a reported 25 protestors blocking a family ’s driveway with an inflatable giant rat			2
‘ by the @entity67 printing that we ’re all thugs we ’re all terrorists , we ’re all @entity191 knows what they said about us , it ’s easy for me to brush off … me and my colleagues and comrades just thought “ that ’s a badge of honour pretty much ” , ’ mr @entity29 was recorded saying			0
conservative mp @entity199 , a member of @entity201 ’s policy board , said : ‘ nobody should have to live in fear of union bully boys demonstrating outside their family home – to hear them talking about it with such pride is chilling			2

if he is too weak to stand up to the unions his is too weak to stand up for hardworking people			0
