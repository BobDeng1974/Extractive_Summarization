tiny robots built to mimic human movements are now so advanced they can - in theory - fly light aircraft			1
a replica robotic human , no more than five inches tall , has been filmed at the controls of a flight simulator , from which it can control a small airplane			2
the device - a diminutive model called the @entity10 - is able to taxi the stationary plane , complete a take - off , finish a short flight and bring the plane in to approach the runway			1
landing the plane - the final and most complicated step - still requires human assistance , but it is hoped this too will be mastered soon			0
in footage from the event , the @entity10 is seen flicking switches on a pilots ' console , then clamping down on a joystick to steer the plane as it soars through the sky			1
part of the feat is achieved by the robot being pre-programmed to know where the buttons are and how to press them			0
data feeds from the simulator also influence parts of steering , such as the pitch , roll and yaw of the craft			0
but the some of the steering is achieved by the machine 's webcam seeing the simulation of the ground and sky - and reacting accordingly			0
during the entire simulation , the robot receives no external inputs and makes all the decisions itself			0
working it out : a combination of processes and data feed into the robot to help it make decisions about flight the details of the technology were laid out in a research paper called a @entity72 for full - functionality automation using a humanoid , by @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , scientists from the @entity79			1
while the footage from the event reveals some abrupt twists and turns from the robot pilot , the movements are technically viable , if jerky			2
indeed the inventors behind the modified @entity10 are so confident in its flying abilities that they think it could meet @entity92 guidelines for flying real airplanes			1
one said : ' pibot can satisfy the various requirements specified in the flying handbook by the @entity96			0

small device called a @entity10 shown working *miniature* plane controls
robotics event in @entity23 saw tiny robot taking off and steering *mid-air*
researchers say the bot is advanced enough to meet @entity96 rules
