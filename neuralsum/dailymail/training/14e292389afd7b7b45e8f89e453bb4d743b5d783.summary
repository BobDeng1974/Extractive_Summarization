by @entity0 last updated at 7:46 pm on 17th november 2011 a convicted sex offender who snatched a seven - year - old girl before raping and strangling her begged for forgiveness minutes before he was put to death			2
@entity5 , 46 , was sentenced to lethal injection for the brutal killing in @entity8 , @entity9 of @entity10 , who was murdered just after finishing the first grade in 1999			1
the child killer was administered with lethal drugs in @entity9 last night , but not before he had pleaded for forgiveness from @entity10 's family			2
executed : @entity5 begged for forgiveness minutes before he was given a lethal injection after being convicted of the murder of seven - year - old @entity10 relatives of the seven - year - old , including her mother @entity22 , watched through a window as @entity5 was strapped to a gurney in the death chamber with needles in his arms			1
seconds before he was injected , the killer told @entity10 's family : ' i hope you will find peace in your heart			0
' my sympathy goes out to you			0
i hope you find it in your heart to forgive me			0
i do n't know why all of this happened			0
' minutes earlier the girl 's mother had entered the death chamber , seen @entity5 on the gurney with needles in his arms and said , ' he 's going to get what he deserves			1
' as the drugs took effect , @entity5 appeared to go to sleep , taking several breaths before all movement stopped			1
he was pronounced dead at 6:21 p.m. @entity50 â€” 11 minutes after the drugs were administered			0
grieving mother : @entity22 holds a photograph of her seven - year - old daughter @entity53 , who became @entity5 's victim in 1999 appeals were exhausted and no late legal maneuvers were made to keep @entity5 from becoming the 13th @entity9 inmate to be put to death by the state this year			1
@entity10 's battered body was found in weeds behind a convenience store near her home hours after she was reported missing in june 1999			1
a baby sitter who discovered her gone identified @entity5 as having visited the residence earlier that night			1
@entity22 , the girl 's mother , told authorities at the time that she met @entity5 at a bar and he 'd been calling her even though she 'd given him the brushoff			1
police went to @entity5 's apartment about two miles away and found some blood - spotted clothing of his in a trash bin			1
@entity78 on the slain girl 's body was linked to him through dna testing , and @entity5 was charged with capital murder			1
' he tried to blame it on somebody else , ' @entity81 , one of his trial lawyers , said			0
' he was not a very repentant individual ... just a constant denial that it was n't him , the facts to the contrary			0
' a judge who authorized a review of @entity79 in the case was told last week the findings were consistent with the evidence during @entity5 's 2001 trial , where his attorneys had challenged the validity of the results			1
his victim : @entity53 ( pictured ) was raped and strangled to death , this is the shrine her mother created in her living room as a memory earlier this year , the @entity106 @entity105 refused to review claims he was mentally impaired and ineligible for execution			0
last month , the @entity109 rejected an attempt to renew that claim and others questioning whether he had effective legal help at his trial			0
investigators determined that blood on @entity5 's clothing retrieved from the trash was his and not the slain girl 's			1
but a @entity122 inmate testified @entity5 told him he got rid of the clothing because he did n't want detectives to think the blood came from the child			2
put to death : the family of @entity10 had watched through a window as @entity5 was given a lethal injection at the @entity131 ( file picture ) the @entity109 , in a 2003 ruling upholding his conviction and death sentence , said the discarded clothing provided some evidence of his awareness of guilt and the timing of his action showed knowledge of the crime			2
@entity5 , against the advice of his lawyers , twice took the stand at his five - day murder trial , defiantly responding to prosecutors ' questions and accusing them of coaching witnesses			2
' he had a very inflated opinion of his abilities to con people , ' @entity81 said			0
@entity5 had been convicted in the past for assault , sexual assault and cocaine possession			2
his execution is likely the last one this year in @entity9 , the nation 's most active capital punishment state			0
the 13 executions this year are the lowest number the state has seen in 15 years			0
but the state already has at least five prisoners scheduled for lethal injection early next year .			0
