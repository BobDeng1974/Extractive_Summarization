by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 5 october 2012 a nephew who was branded an ' ostentatious spendthrift ' by his uncle will inherit his £ 800,000 @entity5 home - despite the elderly relative leaving a will to the contrary			1
before he died , aged 90 , retired art historian , @entity9 ' @entity8 , said his nephew @entity10 was ' the last person ' he wanted to have @entity11 , his grade - ii listed long house in @entity13			1
the widower was adamant that his nephew would ' blow all the money ' if he got his hands on it and that he wanted to leave £ 650,000 to charity - but now his wishes have finally been thwarted by an @entity21 ruling			1
dispute : @entity10 won his legal battle to get the £ 800,000 home , despite his uncle 's wishes to the fury of other members of the family and charities that would otherwise have benefited , the court held mr @entity10 to a ' bargain ' he made before he died and declared his nephew and his partner , @entity34 , the rightful owners of @entity11			1
it was the disappearance of mr @entity10 ’s beloved @entity38 lawn mower from an outhouse after his wife ’s death that made him realise he should not be alone and he invited his nephew , @entity42 and their two children to move down from their @entity46 home to live with him			2
the couple set up home in the farmhouse ’s east wing , while mr @entity10 stayed in the west wing , but by the time mr @entity10 died in 2010 they were dragging each other through the courts			2
the picturesque property has been the focus of a legal battle and family feud the nephew and his family were adamant that mr @entity10 had promised to leave them his home in return for uprooting themselves from their home in @entity46 and moving south to care for him			1
however , the pensioner insisted the only deal he ever struck with the couple was that they could live in the house rent - free if they contributed towards the bills			0
to the day he died , he insisted he would be entirely within his rights to throw them out			0
in august last year , a year after mr @entity10 died , judge @entity77 accepted the couple ’s plea that an agreement had been struck by the uncle and awarded them the whole of @entity11 , subject to inheritance tax			2
dejected : @entity87 and @entity88 ( left ) , his niece and her husband , lost out after the @entity21 ruled in favour of @entity10 over ownership of the @entity92 - listed house			1
@entity34 ( right ) , @entity10 's partner , claims they never would have left @entity46 if they had not been promised the house @entity97 : a self portrait by the late @entity99			1
he claims his nephew was ' the last person ' he wanted to have his home that was despite a witness statement signed by mr @entity10 the month before he died in which he insisted : ' @entity10 would be the last person that i would leave the house to			1
there was never any intention of leaving my house to him , or anyone else			0
' the house made up the vast bulk of mr @entity10 ’s estate - valued at over £ 1m - and the judge ’s ruling meant that charities , his great - granddaughter , @entity115 , and his niece and her husband all lost out			2
@entity118 ’ ruling came under fire at the @entity120 where the executors of mr @entity10 ’s estate , including his niece @entity123 and her husband @entity124 , argued that he got it wrong and was far too generous to @entity10 and @entity42			0
@entity127 , for the executors , said the relationship between @entity129 and his nephew was ' not easy ' even before the widower decided to share his home			0
mr @entity10 had ' bankrupted ' his nephew over an unpaid loan in the 1960s and the evidence was that he regarded the younger man as ' a spendthrift , ostentatious and a risky proposition '			1
the court heard trouble brewed in 2009 when the couple discovered mr @entity10 had no intention of leaving them the house			0
they went to court , claiming the old man had promised it to them , although he ' vehemently denied ' ever having done anything of the sort			0
the elder mr @entity10 even sought an injunction against the couple , seeking access for himself and his carers to guest rooms and the house ’s laundry room			0
in his ruling , judge @entity77 accepted @entity34 ’s account that she had only reluctantly agreed to abandon @entity46 for @entity5 and would never have done so had mr @entity10 not assured her that she and her husband would inherit the house			0
the couple had helped the old man empty his bins , get his car in and out of his garage and put his laundry into the washing machine and , although that ' did not amount to a great deal ' , the judge said it sealed the ' bargain ' they had reached with mr @entity10			2
in his final will , signed in 2009 , mr @entity10 tried to leave £ 650,000 - more than half his estate - to charity			2
he directed that the rest of his his estate be split into 100 equal parts , with 55 of them going to his great granddaughter , ms @entity115 , 15 of them to @entity10 and mrs @entity123 and the remaining 30 to @entity10 and @entity42 - but only on condition that they moved out of the house within six months of his death			0
however , the pensioner ’s plans were defeated by @entity118 ’ ruling , with the asset that made up almost 80 % of his estate going to the couple with whom he was engaged in a bitter legal dispute until he died			1
had mr @entity10 ’s will been observed , there would have been no inheritance tax liability on his estate but the court heard @entity118 ’ ruling saddled the estate with a tax bill for almost £ 160,000 .			0

@entity10 wins fight to get grade ii - listed property , despite uncle 's ' vehement ' *objection*
