it may at first seem a highly illogical picture - but fear not , you can klingon to the knowledge it really did come from the surface of @entity6			0
@entity7 today revealed this amazing v - shaped dune field on @entity6 - which looks uncannily like the @entity10 logo from the hit tv show @entity12			1
it was spotted by @entity7 's @entity14			1
this image was acquired by the @entity30 camera aboard the orbiter on dec. 30 , 2013			0
' in this image of a dune field in a large crater near @entity20 , some of the dunes appear to be in formation , ' @entity7 said			1
it likened the formation to flying birds			0
' migratory birds and military aircraft — like during @entity44 — often fly in a v - shaped formation , ' it said			0
' the ' v ' formation greatly boosts the efficiency and range of flying birds , because all except the first fly in the upward motion of air -- called upwash -- from the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead			2
' the odd shapes were formed by a combination of whather and terrain , it said			0
' for dune fields , the spacing of individual dunes is a function of sand supply , wind speed , and topography			1
; the dune field has dozens of the strange shapes on it			1
the find is n't @entity12 's first brush wiht the @entity7 's red planet projects			1
earlier this year actor @entity74 joined growing calls for @entity7 to investigate the bizarre ' jelly doughnut ' shaped rock on the @entity6 surface			1
@entity74 asked @entity7 about the strange @entity6 rock found by @entity80 via @entity81 during a press conference on the opportunity rovers latest discoveries - asking mission controllers if they had ruled out ' @entity6 rock throwers '			1
mission controllers responding by saying @entity74 's theory was ' unlikely '			2
' we 've got another question from @entity81 , this one from @entity74 , ' @entity7 spokesman @entity89 said , according to @entity92			2
a starfleet flag from the show recently auctioned at @entity95 @entity96 recently took to @entity81 to question @entity7 about its finding on the red planet ' he 'd like to know if you 've ruled out the @entity6 rock throwers in the case of the jelly doughnut			2
' @entity7 later said it had solved the mystery of a ' jelly doughnut ' rock that appeared on the @entity106 - and says it was just a rolling stone			2
the white - rimmed , red - centered rock caused a stir last month when it appeared in an image the rover took on january 8th			0
more recent images show the original piece of rock struck by the rover 's wheel , slightly uphill from where @entity117 , the name @entity7 gave the rock , came to rest			1
' once we moved @entity80 a short distance , after inspecting @entity117 , we could see directly uphill an overturned rock that has the same unusual appearance , ' said opportunity deputy principal investigator @entity125 of @entity126 in @entity127			0
' we drove over it			0
' we can see the track			0
' that 's where @entity117 came from			0
