president @entity0 fired a double - barreled volley at @entity2 on wednesday , saying that the @entity2 is ' hating ' him by pursuing a federal lawsuit over changes to the @entity6 health insurance law			1
the lawsuit received a go - ahead hours later by a 225 - 201 vote , passing the @entity9 along largely party lines with five @entity2 voting ' no. ' every @entity11 opposed the legislation authorizing the lawsuit			1
' there ’s a bunch of stuff that needs to get done , ' @entity0 told a cheering , partisan audience in @entity19 , @entity20 just hours earlier			1
' unfortunately , i think the main vote ... that they ’ve scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job			1
' ' and , by the way , ' he added , ' i ’ve told them – i said , i ’d be happy to do it with you			0
so the only reason i ’m doing it on my own is because you do n’t do anything			0
' in an off - the - cuff speech filled with rabble - rousing language , @entity0 blamed @entity2 in the @entity9 for blocking his agenda on make - work infrastructure jobs , illegal immigration and a minimum wage hike			1
but he reserved his biggest applause lines for an attack on the idea of facing a federal judge over questions of executive overreach			2
' stop just hating ' : @entity0 singled out congressional republicans for scorn on wednesday in @entity19 , mocking efforts to sue him for overextending his authority with changes to the @entity6 law campaign - style love fest : president @entity0 ( bottom , white shirt ) greeted a partisan crowd after speaking about the economy ' some of the things we ’re doing without @entity62 are making a difference , but we could do so much more if @entity62 would just come on and help out a little bit , ' he said to applause			1
come on and help out a little bit			0
stop being mad all the time			0
stop just hating all the time			0
let ’s get some work done together			0
' the lawsuit that faces the @entity0 administration is focused on unilateral changes the @entity72 made to the @entity6 , a sweeping health insurance overhaul passed by @entity73 without any @entity2 votes			1
on july 11 house speaker @entity75 announced that his lawsuit would go ahead			1
@entity0 , he said , ' changed the health care law without a vote of @entity62 ' in 2013 , ' effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it			1
' the president , he carped , ' believes he has the power to make his own laws			0
' the @entity0 administration has taken several actions that @entity2 say twisted the plain meaning of the @entity6 law 's black - letter text , ignoring dates that the law set in stone – for both practical and political reasons			1
' the administration has twice pushed back the law 's requirement that large employers provide health insurance to their workers , even though the law reads that it ' shall apply to months beginning after december 31 , 2013			2
' companies with between 50 and 99 employees now can flout the law until 2016 without paying tax penalties			0
larger employers have until 2015			0
in a twist of irony , @entity2 themselves sought similar delays in 2013 when @entity111 's two major political parties came to loggerheads during a budget battle , forcing a temporary , partial government shutdown			2
@entity0 's changes , however , came without consulting @entity62 : by the time the @entity116 put them in place , the @entity9 was in @entity2 hands and no longer in the mood to tinker with @entity111 's gargantuan medical insurance market			1
on wednesday , the president was in full combat mode again			2
@entity125 chairman rep. @entity124 carried the ball for republicans on wednesday in a hearing to finalize the terms of a lawsuit against the @entity0 administration ' look , we ’ve got just today and tomorrow until @entity62 leaves town for a month , ' he said , ' and we ’ve still got some serious work to do			1
' ' i mean , everybody recognizes this is a political stunt , ' he said of the lawsuit , ' but it ’s worse than that , because every vote they ’re taking like that means a vote they ’re not taking to actually help you			2
... and , by the way , you know who is paying for this suit they ’re going to file ? you			0
' speaker of the house @entity75 has insisted that his lawsuit wo n't be a prelude to impeachment , but only an action to force the president to uphold his duties under the @entity160 @entity0 also claimed that if @entity75 's legal action were to go to trial , ' i would have already left office ' by the time it was resolved			1
' so it ’s not a productive thing to do			0
' on monday @entity75 penned an op - ed in @entity168 , arguing that suing the president is ' not about me vs. president @entity0			1
this is about future congresses and future presidents			0
' ' there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government			1
it is the judiciary branch ’s role to help resolve it			1
i believe this path is the right one to defend our institution and preserve the @entity160			0
' on july 24 the @entity125 green - lighted suing the president in a preliminary vote that fell along partisan lines			2
as the committee met wednesday to finalize the language and move for a debaet on the @entity9 floor , warring sides heard from constitutional lawyers and picked fights with each other over whether @entity0 has abused his power			1
' this is not a political issue			0
this is not an issue that should pit republicans against @entity73 , ' said @entity204 @entity2 rep. @entity124 , who chairs the committee			0
' any person interested in our @entity160 and our brilliant system of separation of powers should be worried about what is currently happening in our country			0
' @entity214 @entity11 @entity213 disagreed , calling the lawsuit ' frivolous on steroids			0
it 's absolutely insane what you all are doing			0
' ' this is a partisan political stunt timed to peak in the @entity9 in november , right as the midterm elections are happening , ' added @entity223 @entity73 rep. @entity222			2
' the @entity9 majority is suing the president simply for doing his job			1
' @entity213 was a federal judge until 1989 , when he was impeached and removed from office , one of only eight federal officials in @entity111 history to wear that professional stain			2
in that case , both houses of @entity62 were controlled by @entity73			2
his impeachment was carried out on charges of bribery and perjury			0
the @entity9 , to which he now belongs , condemned him by a vote of 413 - 3			2
hypocrite : @entity223 @entity73 rep. @entity241 opposed the lawsuit on wednesday but once joined in a similar legal action against president @entity244 @entity214 @entity73 rep. @entity213 slammed the planned lawsuit as a partisan witch - hunt formulated for political advantage in november 's midterm elections ; he has been on the receiving end of ethics proceedings before , as the only member of @entity62 to have been impeached and removed from the bench as a federal judge @entity222 joined in a 2006 lawsuit against president @entity244 over that year 's federal budget bill			1
@entity257 law professor @entity256 told the @entity125 that ' it is not a political question when this body goes to court and says the president has exceeded his authority			2
' if @entity62 fails to hold the @entity72 to its constitutional responsibilities , he said , ' i think this system is going to change in a very significant and in my view a dangerous way			1
' attorney @entity270 , a former @entity271 administration official , said in his testimony that asking a federal judge to settle disputes when the president does n't administer a law the way the @entity9 wants ' would be an unprecedented aggrandizement of the political power of the judiciary			1
' ' such a radical liberalization of the role of unelected judges in matters previously entrusted to the elected branches of government should be rejected , ' he said			2
the @entity111 @entity160 requires the president to ' take care that the laws be faithfully executed			0
' @entity290 law professor @entity289 told the panel on wednesday that @entity2 have ' an excellent chance ' of winning a lawsuit if it focuses on the meaning of that line in @entity111 's founding document			1
in a sparsely attended press conference following the vote to sue the president , @entity9 minority leader @entity297 blamed @entity2 for frittering away money on a lawsuit that ' should not be a priority			1
' ' we do n't have money to have early childhood education for children , they have rejected the president 's universal pre-k , but they do have money to sue the president , ' @entity297 said			1
' how much money is that ? nobody knows			0
' she also insisted the @entity62 ' lacks standing ' to sue			2
' they certainly do not have standing to sue the @entity319			0
' ' this is about the road to impeachment , ' she claimed , although @entity75 said this week that impeachment is off the table			0
@entity9 minority whip @entity326 accused @entity2 of wasting time and @entity111 ' money in search of ' partisan political confrontations			0
' ' this lawsuit will go nowhere , ' he predicted .			0

@entity9 vote wednesday *afternoon* *confirmed* that @entity62 will sue @entity0
president told @entity19 audience that he has taken more than *40* executive actions this year because @entity62 is n't doing its job
house speaker @entity75 *spearheaded* the federal lawsuit over unilateral changes the @entity72 made to the @entity6 law
@entity62 was n't consulted about the changes , which made it more politically *palatable* by pushing back *specific* *deadlines* written into the law
if @entity75 's lawsuit were to go to trial and see a *verdict* , @entity0 said , ' i would have already left office '
@entity75 wrote on monday that ' there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government . it is the judiciary branch ’s role to help resolve it '
