by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 08:07 est , 24 october 2012 watchdogs have ruled that a tv ad featuring a naked man strolling through the countryside wearing nothing but a cap was not offensive			0
the commercial for @entity9 ham was supposed to be a light - hearted attempt to present the product as natural and wholesome			0
however , it drew 370 complaints to the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) from shocked viewers with many arguing it was both offensive and unsuitable to be seen by children			1
natural look : the nude picknickers in the advertisment that prompted 370 complaints the tv ad showed the man standing in a field admiring a sandwich before strolling past a group of naked people who were eating a picnic			1
as he walked , the man sang : ‘ oh @entity9 ham , as nature intended , you 've nothing to hide @entity9 ham , to me you taste blooming splendid			0
’ a voice - over then added : ‘ new @entity9 ham			2
@entity34 's only ham made with 100 per cent natural ingredients			2
’ the company said the ad demonstrated a ‘ well - adjusted , comfortable , and completely non-sexual attitude to the human body ’ , while surveys with mums had received a positive response			1
' as nature intended ' : the @entity14 did not have a problem with the naked man in the ham advert the company said the advert demonstrated a ' well adjusted , comfortable and completely non-sexual attitude to the human body ' the @entity14 accepted that defence and said customers would understand the ' light - hearted reference ' misleading : the @entity14 took issue with the fact that the ham was made in @entity57 and not @entity34 that defence has been accepted by the @entity14 in a ruling published today			1
the watchdog said : ‘ consumers would understand that it was a light - hearted reference to the product being ' as nature intended '			0
‘ whilst we understood the ad may not appeal to everyone , we considered that it was not sexual in tone and we concluded that it was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence			0
’ but , while the @entity14 was happy with the nudity , it has decided to ban the commercial on the basis it gave a misleading impression about where the ham was made			1
for while the advertisement described it has ‘ @entity34 ’s only ham made with 100 per cent natural ingredients ’ , the product is actually made in @entity57 by @entity82			1
the @entity14 said : ‘ whilst we accepted the ad did not refer directly to the provenance of the product , we considered that describing the product as @entity34 's only ham was likely to be interpreted by consumers as meaning the product was @entity34 in origin , when in fact that was not the case			2
‘ we therefore concluded that the claim was misleading			0

advert drew 370 complaints to the @entity14 ( @entity14 )
the company said the advert demonstrated a ‘ well - adjusted , comfortable , and completely non-sexual attitude to the human body ’
@entity14 was fine with the nudity but said ad gave misleading *information* about where the ham was made
