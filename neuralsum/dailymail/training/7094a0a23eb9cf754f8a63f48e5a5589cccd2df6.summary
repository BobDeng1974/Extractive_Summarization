the @entity1 manager reckons @entity2 should have had three men sent off , too ! click here to read what @entity5 had to say three @entity2 players and one @entity1 man could all have seen red but their managers could not have complained after their own embarrassing spat			2
two senior managers with vast experience should not get involved in such antics			0
@entity14 appeared to be the aggressor but there is seldom smoke without fire with @entity18			0
a warning was correct for both			0
the incident which sparked the confrontation was a poor @entity24 challenge on @entity25 ; at full speed a yellow will have appeared correct to @entity29 , replays show that red would have been appropriate			1
@entity48 could have gone for giving the penalty away , while @entity51 ’s lunge at @entity52 was very dangerous			1
@entity1 's @entity53 is fouled by @entity2 's @entity48 in the box during the @entity56 match meanwhile , seeing @entity1 goalkeeper @entity57 trying to carry on despite what appeared to be concussion showed football must act before a player is seriously injured			1
@entity62 has stopped players continuing to play when concussed — now football must do the same			0
@entity57 suffered a blow when he came out to challenge @entity25 but he played on afterwards @entity25 immediately showed concern for @entity57 as the @entity1 goalkeeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch @entity57 is escorted up the tunnel and the no 1 @entity1 goalkeeper was immediately treated by paramedics			2

@entity1 's @entity24 should have been sent off for his challenge on @entity2 forward @entity25 , says @entity74 's @entity36
@entity2 's @entity44 could have had a second yellow card for a body check on @entity47 , and @entity48 's penalty looked last man
@entity2 's @entity51 ’s lunge at @entity52 was very dangerous
