third highest life expectancy : @entity1 men born in 2012 are expected to live until the age of 80.5 years , placing them just below @entity20 and @entity21 on the rankings the figures , which show increased life expectancy across the world , are for children born in 2012			1
@entity20 tops the table at 81.2 years for men , while @entity30 women are expected to live the longest at 87 years			2
