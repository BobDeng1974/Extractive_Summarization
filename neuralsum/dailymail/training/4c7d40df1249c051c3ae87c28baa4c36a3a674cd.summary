by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 4 february 2013 the identities of 80 dead children were stolen by the police and used to create fake passports , it has been revealed			2
the names and dates of birth were taken without the knowledge of the children ’s parents and used by officers infiltrating protest groups			1
for 30 years , detectives from @entity15 trawled through national birth and death records looking for suitable identities			1
they used the birth certificates to apply for a variety of identity documents to make their aliases appear genuine			2
@entity24 , an undercover police sergeant , as he apeared in the early 1980s when he posed as @entity25 , a protester against capitalism in some cases officers spent up to ten years in the same guise			1
one , @entity24 , adopted the identity of an eight - year - old boy called @entity25 , who died in 1968 from leukaemia			1
another officer said he felt he was ‘ stomping on the grave ’ of the four - year - old boy whose identity he used while working undercover in anti-racist groups			1
and a third detective spent years living under the identity of a child who died in a car crash			2
under cover officers using assumed identities also formed sexual relationships with targets in groups they had infiltrated in the 1980s , which included environmental and anti-racist groups			1
lord @entity48 , former @entity49 , has condemned the practice and called for a public inquiry - warning that unacceptable practices might still be in use today			1
he said it was ' really worrying ' that police chiefs appeared not to have entirely ruled out a repeat of recently - exposed cases of officers entering sexual relationships with targets			1
speaking on the @entity60 radio 4 today programme , he said : ' how are you supposed to maintain a level of fair and objective evidence - gathering if you are having sex with the person you are targeting , fathering a baby and then abandoning it , using a dead child 's identity ? ' ' these are all examples of areas in which the police have completely lost their moral compass and have completely failed to understand the boundaries			2
' we do n't know quite how these units were operating in days gone by			2
it looks as though they 've effectively gone rogue			0
i am not at all clear how high up in @entity15 these sorts of operations were being organised			1
he added : ' what we really need is a public inquiry into undercover policing which takes evidence , takes advice , sets out some guidelines , sets out some mechanisms so we can be confident these sorts of procedures are not being followed today			1
' we need to know how we got there , where we are now and we need to be reassured that this sort of behaviour wo n't occur in the future and i think an inquiry is really the only way to achieve that			1
' i do think the government will think seriously about this because these sorts of stories seem to be endless			0
' it is drip , drip , drip , it is corrosive , it is seedy and i think we really need to find ourselves in a position where we can reassure the public that this sort of behaviour is not going to carry on			1
' after initial protestations that undercover officers getting sexually involved with targets could no longer happen , there appeared to have been a ' subtle shift in which it is being suggested that it could be appropriate in some circumstances '			1
' this is a deeply ethical issue which the police have to grapple with , ' he said			0
police were inspired by the film , @entity125 @entity126 , a former under cover detective for the @entity124 , said : ' in the undercover unit of which i was a director , we were completely dedicated to combatting serious and organised crime			1
' we had nothing to do with protest groups or environmental campaigns			1
' the state gave us a fake identities we required ; passports , driving licences , or credit cards			0
' we would never dream of using a dead child 's identity , i can not comprehend why anyone would want to adopt an identity rather than create one			0
' these people were largely staffed with people who did n't have detective experience , clearly the management was lacking in experience and authority			0
' in our unit we always had clear end games , to take the drugs , stolen commodities or to prevent murder			0
it seems these units had no clear goals or end games			0
it 's a recipe for disaster			0
' the technique of using dead children as aliases was borrowed from @entity165 ’s novel , @entity125			1
@entity166 mp , the chairman of the home affairs select committee , said he was shocked by the ‘ gruesome ’ practice			1
‘ it will only cause enormous distress to families who will discover what has happened concerning the identities of their dead children , ’ he said			0
‘ this is absolutely shocking			0
my disbelief at some of the tactics used has become shock as a result of these latest revelations			0
‘ it is clear that inappropriate action has been taken by undercover police in the past			0
but this has taken it to a new level			0
’ the practice was introduced 40 years ago by police to lend credibility to the back stories of covert operatives spying on protesters			2
it also guarded against the possibility that campaigners would discover their true identities			0
since then dozens of officers , including those who posed as anti-capitalists , animal rights activists and violent far - right campaigners , have used the identities of dead children			2
one document appeared to suggest around 80 officers from a secret unit called the @entity206 used such identities between 1968 and 1994			1
the total number could be higher			0
an officer who adopted the identity of four - year - old @entity211 compared the methods used by @entity15 to those of the @entity214 – the secret police in the @entity216			1
‘ a part of me was thinking about how i would feel if someone was taking the names and details of my dead son , ’ he said			2
‘ i used to get this really odd feeling			0
’ the officer said he always felt guilty when celebrating the birthday of the four - year - old whose identity he took			0
he was particularly aware that somewhere the parents of the boy would be ‘ thinking about their son and missing him ’			0
to fully immerse himself in the adopted identity and appear convincing when speaking about his upbringing , mr @entity211 visited the child ’s home town to familiarise himself with the surroundings			0
@entity211 , who was under cover in the 1990s , said @entity206 officers visited the house they were supposed to have been born in so they would have a memory of the building			2
‘ it ’s those little details that really matter – the weird smell coming out of the drain that ’s been broken for years , the location of the post office , the number of the bus , ’ he told the @entity243 newspaper			2
fifteen separate inquiries have already been launched since 2011 , when @entity252 was unmasked as a police spy who had slept with several women , including one who was his girlfriend for six years , during his time under cover			0
@entity15 said the practice was not currently authorised , but announced an investigation into ‘ past arrangements for undercover identities used by @entity206 officers ’ .			1

details were taken so officers could infiltrate protest groups
officers formed sexual relationships with their targets
they modelled the process on the film , @entity125
@entity15 says practice no longer employed but launches investigation
former @entity49 called for a public inquiry
