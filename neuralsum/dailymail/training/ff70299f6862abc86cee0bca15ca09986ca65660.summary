by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:24 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:27 est , 29 december 2013 a fascinating map has been released online that demonstrates the staggering advances technology has made to commuters embarking on one day of travel from @entity7			2
less than a quarter of a century after the @entity10 , @entity9 was still more than 24 - hours away from the nation 's largest city , but over the course of 134 - years , @entity8 was reachable in the same amount of time			1
the map reveals the transition of horse carriage to train as technology opened up the continent - eventually giving way to the airline boom of the 1930s , which meant that nowhere on the 48 - contiguous states was more than one day away			1
one day of travel : this is a representation of the map that @entity26 published as the monumental @entity27 which has been published online by the @entity28 at the @entity29 the map is in fact compiled from the legendary @entity27 , which was first published by @entity26 in 1932 and contained over 700 examples of every aspect of the nation 's expansion from @entity36 colony to continental power			1
in addition to the opening up of the nation by rail and air , the maps documented population explosions , presidential elections and even shipping times from @entity7 to @entity47			0
thirty years time : in 1800 it was impossible to get to @entity9 from @entity7 and @entity49 was a month away by stagecoach - while by 1830 these times had essentially been halved as the railroads across the @entity52 began to become established the golden spike : the transcontinental railroad across the @entity52 opened up travel from @entity56 to @entity57 - and put most of the @entity58 and @entity59 within 2 days of @entity7 - but @entity60 and the @entity61 were still up to a month away @entity9 , where the @entity62 's wrote and signed the @entity63 , opened up as a day - trip to @entity7 's around 1830			1
however , the nation 's captial at @entity67 was still over one days travel from the cultural and financial center of the fledgling @entity52			0
as the nation 's railroads were established , travel times were essentially halved , but by 1930 , it was still just possible to reach @entity74 by train			0
obviously , destinations reachable within one day spectacularly shortened and by 1930 a plane journey put @entity78 within reach of all travelers			0
advances : after more than 70 years of transcontinental rail travel - commuters and travelers were able to traverse the 48 - contiguous states with three days - a staggering shortening in times in 1934 , @entity87 made the @entity89 divide less than a day , when they pioneered a three - stop airline service between @entity7 and @entity8 that took a total of 18 - hours to complete			1
@entity26 's incredibly detailed maps were turned into modern interactive , motion - picture maps by the @entity29 's @entity28 - ready to be poured over by the @entity95 generation			1
fliers : however , while the railroads were now offering to put the nation 's largest cities in reach of one another - air travel finally put @entity8 within one day 's travel - all by the third decade of the 20th century the one - day time estimates themselves were made by @entity26 and his team and in one revealing snippet from the original text , he states that in 1800 stagecoach runs from @entity7 would fail to leave the @entity58 while a trip to @entity111 , @entity109 would take a staggering 10 days of sailing			2
@entity26 's maps were viewed as visionary when they were released - as their demonstrations of time changes and technological changes revealed the growth of the nation			2
thirty years time : in 1800 it was impossible to get to @entity9 from @entity7 and @entity49 was a month away by stagecoach - while by 1830 these times had essentially been halved as the railroads across the @entity52 began to become established presidential victor : this map shows how each county voted in the 1892 general election won by @entity129 @entity128 against @entity130 and @entity132 candidate @entity131 given fresh new life by their digital re-haul , the maps of travel times act as a testament to infrastructure changes and technological advancements			1
the ' golden spike ' that was driven into the ground to mark the completion of the @entity144 's transcontinental railway was hit in 1869 and of course automobiles became mass produced in 1908 with the @entity147			0
' it ’s so far ahead of its time , ' @entity148 , the founder of the @entity28 and a senior consultant on the project said to the @entity154			0
' it suggests how people experienced geography			0
you could ask , ‘ what would it mean for a family to move to @entity162 ? ’			0

@entity29 's @entity28 releases the legendary @entity27 of the @entity164 in digital form
