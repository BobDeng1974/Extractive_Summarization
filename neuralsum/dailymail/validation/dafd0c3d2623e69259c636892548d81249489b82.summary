@entity0 claimed his 100th clean sheet in the @entity2 on saturday when @entity3 beat @entity4 3 - 0 at the @entity5			1
he became the 14th goalkeeper to pass the milestone but has some way to go before he can claim the crown , currently held by @entity10 with 169			1
yet at the age of 27 , @entity0 has plenty of time left to make his way through the list that includes @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity0 kept his 100th clean sheet against @entity4 on saturday @entity0 's clean sheet could have gone when @entity21 had this chance but the striker hit the crossbar @entity10 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) lead the list of the most @entity2 clean sheets @entity10 , current player - manager for @entity29 club @entity28 , got his 169 from a career that saw him play for @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity3 and @entity34			1
@entity35 's @entity25 would most likely have passed that total , had he not lost his place as first - choice goalkeeper to 22 - year - old @entity38 under @entity39			0
third - placed @entity40 left @entity35 for @entity41 on a free transfer in january as cover for the injured @entity44 , whose dad @entity45 sits ninth in the list			0
yet @entity40 is running out of time to close in on @entity25 with the 42 - year - old - the oldest player to feature in the @entity2 this season - set to be relegated as @entity41 sit bottom			2
@entity54 goalkeeper @entity53 , having conceded five against @entity50 during their @entity52 exit on thursday , will look to move up the list before the 36 - year - old retires			0
as for @entity0 , the man that thwarted @entity58 's @entity57 in the @entity59 last week , he will now chase @entity60 and @entity61 on 107 and 108 respectively			0
he will next be able to do so against @entity62 on april 6 after the international break with @entity64			0
@entity57 tries to score past goalkeeper @entity0 during @entity58 's @entity59 win over @entity3 @entity0 kept @entity57 , currently the world 's best player , out during @entity3 's visit to the @entity70 in @entity58			1
