by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 16 september 2013 with divorce fast becoming the norm it seems true love is harder and harder to find these days			1
but as these letters reveal , one smitten couple found a love so strong it was able to endure even while they were separated during @entity10 not only that , it lasted for a total of 70 years of marriage until they both died in 2011 , he aged 96 and she aged 92 , within just three days of one another			1
how time passes : @entity20 and @entity21 wed on @entity22 1941 while @entity20 was on 48 - hour leave from the @entity24 and stayed married for the next 70 years but , as remarkable as their relationship had seemed in life , in death it was about to give up its biggest and most heartwarming surprise			1
after @entity20 and @entity21 had passed relatives discovered they had kept 250 love letters , telegrams , notes and @entity37 's cards from each other			1
their grandson , dr @entity39 , has taken them along to the @entity41 tv program			0
in one extract read on tonight 's show , @entity20 writes : ' you are the most wonderful , marvellous , precious , beloved , lovable , adoring , adorable , charming , divine and loving sweetheart wife that has ever lived			1
' @entity47 , come a little closer and let me whisper in your darling ears , all these loving words , because they are meant for you , my sweetheart			0
' the pair wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one another throughout @entity10 the amazing collection of 250 letters , telegrams , notes and @entity37 's cards was stored in a tea chest the couple , who shared the same birthday , kept the memories stashed away inside a tea chest in their home in @entity66 , @entity67			1
speaking about the letters , @entity68 , the show 's host , said : ' @entity71 was a real love story			2
what struck me about the letters was the sheer outpouring of emotion across their pages			2
' they reveal two people who had fallen headlong in love - and that love burned even more brightly while they were forced apart by war			2
' @entity20 and @entity21 wed on @entity22 in 1941 while he was on 48 - hour leave from the @entity24			1
he had volunteered for the @entity85 in 1936 despite having been selected as a professional footballer by @entity87 and served in @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			0

during their long lives the besotted pair built up a large family of two daughters , four grandchildren , and four great - grandchildren and it was grandson who discovered the letters perhaps the most heart - wrenching messages were written when @entity121 's leave was cancelled			1
he says : ' i 'm very sorry my beloved , i ca n't get home			0
that 's all i live for , home and you			0
in another passage he adds : ' we both feel the same when i have to return from leave			0
i have to take a firm hold of myself or i would never come back			0
' i hate to see the back of you as my bus or train pulls out because i know it will be weeks before i set eyes on you again			0
it 's terrible when we have to part - too awful for words			0
' showing a touch of humour , @entity20 writes again to compliment his wife 's skill in the kitchen : ' @entity47 , no matter what you think , i still say that you are a good cook - so let 's not have a small row			2
you know i wish that today i could have sat down to one of your dinners			0
' @entity21 's communication is more limited , as she was kept in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a secret			2
in the letters she did write she talks about the home front , rationing , and hiding under the kitchen table while bombs fell on the main road near their house			0
only a small selection of letter were taken to @entity41 for filming and the family are keeping the rest secret while they decide what to do with them while the letters reveal a lot about the couple 's marriage , the war and their incredible devotion to one another , only a small selection were taken along to the show 's filming in @entity182			1
the rest are being kept a secret while the family , made up of the couple 's two daughters , four grandchildren and four great - grandchildren , decide what to do with them			0
