while your innocent sandwich may seem like a convenient option , experts claim that many seemingly nutritious lunchtime snack choices are laden with unhealthy ingredients			0
research has revealed that the average @entity4 's lunch could harbour more calories and fat than the rest of their daily meals put together			1

that said , we need between 400 - 600 calories for lunch to sustain us through a hectic working day so how do you fuel your day the healthy way ? a raw food company says they have the answer as they are offering sandwiches packed with vegetables to revitalise lunchtimes			1
@entity44 - based company @entity43 , which was established after one of the founders cured their asthma via a raw food diet , has created healthy sandwich alternatives to classic favourites			1
every £ 5.99 sandwich is dehydrated ( mimicking sun drying ) and takes over 30 hours to make			1
' you ca n't rush nature , ' said founder @entity55			0
they decided to use coconut for bacon , walnuts and mushrooms for beef , sunflower seeds for chicken and cashew nuts for cheese and for the " bread " they use sunflower seed , flax , onion and olive oil bread			2
one of their most popular is a wholesome spin on the traditional @entity75 sandwich - a raw @entity76			1
instead of bread , they use nuts and seeds to create something akin to flaxseed and then cram it full of vegetables and smother it with coconut bacon - a mixture of coconut chips and smoked paprika			1
they also offer a sandwich filled with sunflower goujons and a falafel sandwich with @entity95 nut hummus			0
healthy alternative ? @entity43 is a @entity44 company offering more virtuous sandwiches			1
instead of bread , they use nuts and seeds to create something akin to flaxseed and then cram it full of vegetables instead of a beefburger , the duo offer a portobello mushroom coated in ' cheese ' - a cashew sauce			1
speaking to @entity109 , the @entity55 brothers said : ' loving sandwiches and living on this lifestyle we noticed a gap in the market where we could offer healthy alternatives to typical sandwiches and snacks			1
our idea was to develop a range of ready - to - eat , on the go , raw , vegan , fresh and organic food			1
nothing like this in the world seemed to exist			0
this is where the idea of @entity43 spawned from			2
' we really wanted to start a @entity128			0
our thinking behind the range was to turn " junk food " into health food , no easy task			0
we also wanted to make our food look like the traditional sandwiches that we all know but to ensure that they tasted even better			2
' we went to work and spent hours on end trying to perfect our ideas and unique recipes			0
after much trial and error we managed to find the perfect blend of ingredients to create the sandwiches we currently sell today			2
' @entity43 is a family fun business run by two brothers , @entity148 and @entity149 , @entity150			2
their mother does the admin , their father helps make the sandwiches , and their aunty is the delivery driver			2
speaking about the future of the business , they said : ' we have been running for a little under a year and so far the business has trebled			0
we have lots of other healthy and exciting ideas that we are working on and some are already in development			2
regarding the existing range , we are looking to spread the word far and wide			0
ideally we would like to see our food in every health food store in @entity44 and eventually the @entity75			0
' wholesome ingredients : instead of a beefburger , the duo offer a portobello mushroom coated in ' cheese ' - a cashew sauce - and healthy coleslaw so are the raw snacks as good as they sound ? @entity175 , nutritionist at @entity176 , thinks so			1
she said : ' this is an excellent alternative to fast food or a standard sandwich			0
the " bread " is made from nuts , seeds and coconut , which provide healthy fats and more protein compared to standard bread , and more vitamins and minerals – especially when compared to white bread			2
' this also means that it will have a lower glycaemic index than bread , so it has less of an effect on your blood sugar , and should fill you up for longer			0
it ’s also great alternative for those who are avoiding gluten ( or grains in general ) because of a food intolerance			0
the filling includes lots of vegetables , again providing vitamins , minerals and antioxidants			0
' and the vegan alternative to bacon sounds good too – the coconut will provide more fibre and healthier fats than bacon , but is just as filling			0
the one possible drawback is that all the nuts , seeds and coconut could be difficult to digest for some people , especially those who are not used to eating lots of raw food			0
' the healthy snacks may be welcome news after research revealed that 3.5m @entity224 have n’t eaten a vegetable in the last week			1
the ‘ @entity228 - nation ’ study commissioned by @entity227 revealed that over half the nation ( 53 per cent ) eat two or fewer portions of vegetables each day , with nearly one in ten @entity224 ( seven per cent ) eating fewer veg now than they did as a child			1
one in seven ( 14 per cent ) said that one reason they do n’t eat enough vegetables is because they struggle to find exciting ways to prepare them while a quarter ( 27 per cent ) avoid vegetables because they do n't know how to cook them properly			2
almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) said they avoid buying vegetables because they have such a short shelf life and go rotten too quickly			0
meanwhile , more than one in ten @entity224 ( 11 per cent ) are put off eating vegetables because of childhood traumas and bad memories of school dinners			1
worryingly , four per cent of @entity224 believe that pasta and cornflakes make up one of your ‘ five - a - day ’ and a disillusioned two per cent admitted they thought cottage cheese and croissants constitute one of their ‘ five a day ’			1
@entity252 , @entity253 at @entity254 , added : ' there has been such a notable movement towards consumers eating clean and taking responsibility for their health			0
encouraging a healthy lifestyle is something we have always been very passionate about at @entity254 , we have always believed in educating our customers on ingredients so that they can make informed decisions on what to feed their bodies with			2
