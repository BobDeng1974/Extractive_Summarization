the two country 's governments agreed to set up a working group of officials to discuss the case , but @entity35 officials said there was no sign of an end to the deadlock			2
diplomats said @entity4 will not step back from its position that @entity2 should be granted free passage to @entity43			1
this is unacceptable to @entity7 because the law dictates he must be sent to @entity47 to answer rape charges			1
one senior source said officials were frustrated that @entity4 will not budge from what the @entity7 sees as an unjustifiable position			1
he said : ' @entity2 is saying that he is prepared to stay for five years			1
' but the statute of limitations for an extradition request is ten years , so they will be stuck with him in their embassy for nine more years			0
' we had a routine exchange of views			0
they did n't bring anything new to the table			0
@entity4 has not changed its position one bit since the day @entity2 fled to them			1

a recent visitor said : ' he looks very thin and gaunt			0
it looks like he burns the candle at both ends			0
his skin almost appears bleached , almost transparent			0
' it is obvious he has not seen any sunlight for a long time			0
if you ask him why he is still there , he will just mumble something back at you about “ freedom ” and his “ principles ”			0
' support : a crowd gathered outside the embassy in @entity77 as the @entity4 foreign minister visited mr @entity2 nearly a year after he first went into hiding in the building security : the police operation to guard the embassy and prevent mr @entity2 from escaping has already cost more than £ 3million wanted : mr @entity2 faces questioning in @entity47 over alleged sex offences but fears he will be extradited from there to the @entity74 over @entity8 asylum : mr @entity2 is currently being protected within the @entity13 in @entity77 but will be arrested and deported if he steps outside last night the @entity109 , who is thought to have a personal fortune of £ 1million , was pictured smiling as he shook hands with mr @entity3 before their meeting			1

' mr @entity3 added : ' i have just finished meeting with @entity2 who is in good spirits despite the limitations of his accommodation			2
' i was able to say face to face to him , for the first time , that the government of @entity4 remains firmly committed to protecting his human rights and that we continue to seek cast iron assurances to avoid any onward extradition to a third state			2
' good spirits ' : mr @entity3 said mr @entity2 was doing well , as supporters marked the first anniversary of his stay at the embassy with balloons ' during the meeting we were able to speak about the increasing threats against the freedom of people to communicate and to know the truth , threats which come from certain states that have put all of humanity under suspicion			1
' it is believed at least three @entity163 officers are on guard at the embassy , which is on the second floor of a building near @entity168 in @entity169 , 24 hours a day			0
usually one officer stands on the steps outside , while one waits by the lifts in the communal foyer in case mr @entity2 attempts to access the roof and escape by helicopter			1
another stands on an exterior staircase from where they can see the single bed where he sleeps			0
it is believed there are always other officers on standby near the embassy in case of any escape attempt .			0
