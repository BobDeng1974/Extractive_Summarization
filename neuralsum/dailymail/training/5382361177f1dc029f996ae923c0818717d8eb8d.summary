for years , the @entity1 check was a mark of wealth and good taste , with the beige scarf considered a useful experience that would make any outfit			1
retailing at Â£ 315 , it was a wardrobe item that was rarely seen on people without a few zeros in their bank account			0
but in the late 1990 's , the scarf was adopted by the @entity14 clan , worn by the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 and soon became a status stamp for the cool youth			0
@entity22 ( left ) is one of the @entity24 celebrities helping the @entity1 check to make a comeback , she was pictured wearing the distinctive pattern on a scarf while leaving an @entity29 gig in @entity30 last week			1

the plan worked and slowly the distinctively patterned scarf has started to re-emerge as a popular accessory among @entity24 celebrities			0
only a week again , @entity22 was pictured leaving an @entity76 gig in @entity30 wearing a modern - version of the scarf			1
a few months ago , style icon @entity79 was snapped wearing the original nineties version , while @entity82 went even further in a checked raincoat			2
