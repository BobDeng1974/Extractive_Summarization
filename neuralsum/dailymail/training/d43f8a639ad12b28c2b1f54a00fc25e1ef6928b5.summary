a @entity1 retail outlet has been forced to defend criticism about an incredibly thin mannequin displayed in one of its stores			1
the thinly - shaped female model photographed by a @entity9 student , @entity8 , has sparked intense discussion about female body issues and how women should be represented			0
ms @entity13 , 25 , tweeted the image she photographed inside @entity15 accompanied by the caption : ' purging is in this season ! ' and has been the subject of intense criticism by health experts despite the company 's boss deeming the model ' healthy			1
' the mannequin displayed in the @entity15 shop which was posted to @entity28 's twitter page ms @entity8 , a former actress on @entity1 show @entity29 , tweeted the mannequin has the potential to make women feel inadequate and that was a form of ' control			1
' but the company 's boss , @entity35 , told @entity37 that science determines what a healthy weight is and defended the woman wearing the two piece bikini as ' healthy			1
' he said the mannequin 's proportions meant it would have a ' healthy ' body - mass index ( @entity48 ) of 18.8 , just above what would be classed as underweight at 18.4			2
many , including @entity1 radio presenter @entity50 were a little taken a back by the female mannequin he also said that because of the way the mannequin is positioned - its arm raised and slightly inverted - people are led to believe that it is thinner than it really is			2
he said a female in a similar position would have an enhanced rib cage			2
he also said the position of the lights in the store , relative to the body , accentuates the woman 's rib cage			1
' the key is that due to the position of the mannequin with the arm elevated and slightly twisted , the rib cage is naturally enhanced as it would be in real life , ' @entity35 said			1
but ms @entity8 said the debate should not be based around a classification of what is deemed healthy , but making women feel more adequate about their body image			1
' it 's not the mannequin would have a healthy @entity48 , it 's we need a wider range of representations for women 's bodies , ' she tweeted			1
a @entity1 women 's health action director @entity88 said the mannequin undoubtedly ' full on			2
' a budget @entity91 clothing store @entity90 removed a line of models it used which attracted widespread criticism			0
the thin looking females also had protruding ribs and removing it from their stores			0
a range of thin looking female mannequins used by a budget @entity91 clothing store were removed after being criticised the retail stores should bare the responsibility for the image they put out to customers , she said , and respect different shapes and sizes in women			0
women through accurate mannequins of a range of shapes and sizes			0
a 2011 @entity119 and @entity120 survey showed the average @entity48 for a @entity122 woman was 27.6 - classified as ' overweight '			0
@entity125 lecturer in health education @entity123 said the ' incredibly thin ' mannequin was ' disturbing '			0
' when i look at that image with all her ribs showing , the message it 's sending is that that 's desirable and that 's the way you 're supposed to look as a young woman			0
' ' what 's the message they 're hoping to give by using a mannequin like that - that if you wear our clothes you 'll look this so - called ' good ' ? ' she said developing girls between 10 and 12 would be exposed to the image and perpetuate the myth that you had to be thin to be healthy			0
' let 's ask @entity15 to have a diverse range of women 's shapes and sizes that portray much more everyday @entity1 women			2
