@entity0 is backing @entity1 to prove he is still one of @entity3 ’s best defenders and show he is an improved player for his experience at the @entity5			1
there are question marks over @entity1 ’s long - term prospects in the @entity3 squad , given he was criticised for his role in the defeats against @entity12 and @entity13 that condemned @entity15 ’s squad to an early exit			1
@entity0 , though , has no such worries about his captain heading into the new @entity20 campaign and believes the 31 - year - old has recovered sufficiently from a draining experience to show why he can still lead his club and country ’s defence			1
leader : @entity27 manager @entity0 has backed captain @entity1 ahead of the new season heads up : @entity0 is keen for @entity1 to prove he his still one of the country 's best central defenders ‘ when you have been in a tournament like the @entity5 , the days after it can be very raw and you have emotions , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you need a proper break and , by that , i mean time to get a proper perspective on things , time with your family and four weeks away from football			2
‘ the mind - set changes then and the experience of playing in a @entity5 then gives you a head start on players who have never been there			2
that is the way i have seen the players come back from the @entity5 - @entity1 , @entity49 , @entity50			1
‘ they all had different experiences and have come back feeling they are better players for the experience they had i think his experience will make him more determined and a better player , he will be able to anticipate things and reach another level			2
’ beneficial : @entity0 believes having played in the @entity5 will stand his players in good stead for the season @entity1 himself feels he has recovered but says it will only be after @entity27 have got through their opening three tussles – after @entity69 they face @entity70 and @entity71 – will know how much , if any , scarring remains			1
‘ it was difficult watching the @entity5 at home , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ we went away with @entity76 with the family and there was not much tv on			0
you try to forget about it , get run ragged by the kids , get thrown in the pool			0
it is the best medicine to be perfectly honest			0
‘ i did n’t want to be in @entity76 that early in the summer			0
@entity86 would probably be an under - statement			0
it is frustrating not to have been able to stay out longer			0
i would have preferred for us to have played worse , got more points and snuck through			0
it was n’t meant to be			0
