the dress size of the average @entity2 woman has grown from 12 to 16 in just over a decade fashion stores are being urged to show their clothes on larger sized shop mannequins to reflect the true shapes of modern women			1
leading a government drive to promote body confidence among women , equalities minister @entity8 has called on high street stores to feature a wider range of dummies on their shop floor			1
the dress size of the average @entity2 woman has grown from 12 to 16 in just over a decade , but stores are still displaying the latest trends on size 10 dummies			1
the reason for this , according to healty eating campaigners , is the skinny ' waif ' culture , which has dominated the fashion industry for over two decades and been linked to eating disorders among women			1
however , @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , is preparing to display a range of size 16 mannequins in its flagship store - its summer catalogue featured an amputee while three models were aged 40 - plus and one was almost 70			2
@entity8 told the @entity39 : ' i would really like to see more retailers doing the same			2
many customers want to see more realistic images in magazines , tv and on the high street , and having mannequins that reflect and celebrate our diverse society is a really positive way of helping to achieve this			0
' the images we see in the world of fashion are all pretty much the same - it 's as if there 's only one way of being beautiful '			2
the move has also been welcomed by healthy eating campaigners , who say the small sized mannequins can cause low self - esteem in women with fuller figures because they feel guilty that the clothes do not look as good on them as on the models			0

' but not all fashion stores and chains are eager to promote the plus size			1
the @entity80 , which includes @entity81 , criticised for using a painfully thin size - zero model in its website , said its mannequins reflected the profiles of its customers			0
it was for @entity81 that supermodel and original ' waif ' @entity87 designed her own clothes range from 2007 which became bestsellers here and in the @entity94			0
@entity96 mannequins are also mainly size 10 while the @entity98 and @entity99 fashion brands show mainly size 10 - 12 and @entity101 size 16			1
original ' waif ' @entity87 pictured wearing skinny jeans and top from the fashion collection she designed for @entity81 body image and confidence have been debated vigorously among those working in the fashion industry since the ' waif ' look emerged			0
in 1997 @entity94 president @entity112 fired a broadside at the fashion industry for glamorising heroin use by using skinny girls with pale skin and limp arms to promote a ' heroin chic ' look			0
but @entity2 industry insiders claim retailers are already working hard to promote body confidence by ensuring items are available in a wide range of sizes and offering advice on figure - flattering clothes both in - store and online .			0
