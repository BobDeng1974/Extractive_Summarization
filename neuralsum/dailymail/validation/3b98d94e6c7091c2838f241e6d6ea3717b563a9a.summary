these captivating black and white portraits may appear centuries old but a closer inspection will reveal rather modern - looking models			2
the images have been taken using a @entity6 photography technique and are part of a project to resurrect the earliest form of the art. instead of the instant results of @entity13 and other digital apps , each picture takes 20 minutes to develop and requires a number of chemicals			1
the method was invented in 1850 and , although initially used for formal studio portraits , it became enormously popular and photographers started offering casual portraiture at events such as fairs and amusement parks			1
the process works by coating a metal with a chemical called collodion before placing it into a silver nitrate solution , which makes it light sensitive			1
the plate is then loaded into the camera and the picture is taken			1
the exposure time can be anything from a second to a couple of minutes , depending on the light conditions			2
the plate then has to be developed in a solution of iron sulphate and finished with a fixer , which makes the image fully appear			2
in @entity6 times this would have been the deadly poison potassium cyanide , but mr @entity19 opts for a less risky sodium thiosulphate			1
modern models : among his 500 portraits is a photo of musician @entity63 ( left ) from @entity65 rock band @entity64 resurrecting early art - form : he is currently working on a project using the technique and hopes it will encourage others to have a go the whole process has to be done in a dark room under a red light			1
mr @entity19 's project started when he was given a worse - for - wear @entity6 camera by a friend			1
it had been sat abandoned in an attic for at least 70 years - the stand had been destroyed by woodworm and the bellows were in tatters			2
after repairing it he spent a day with @entity85 , a tintype expert who had honed his skills at @entity90 re-enactments , learning the technique			0
he has now taken pictures of about 500 people , using about 1,000 plates and hopes to exhibition them and possibly even make a book			0
among the photos featured is @entity63 from @entity65 rock band @entity64 and @entity99 hero @entity100 , who took part in the d - day landings and was injured by an exploding mine on july 22 1944			0
mr @entity19 , from @entity105 , said : ' it all started about five years ago when i got this camera from a friend whose uncle was having a clear out of his lock - up			1
' i got in touch with this guy in @entity114 who was one of the first to resurrect the process in the @entity116 back in the 1990s and asked if he would mind showing me the process			2
' i went down to @entity114 and spent the day talking about how it works , shot a few plates and he sent me on my way with a lot of 1850s reading material			0
mr @entity19 's project started when he was given a worse - for - wear @entity6 camera which had been rotting in an attic for at least 70 years also among the photographer 's models was @entity99 hero @entity100 ( left ) , who took part in the d - day landings ' it 's sort of trial and error though , i would say i 'm still learning now			1
' people think old fashioned photography you have to wait ages for your pictures to be developed and sent back but actually this was quite instant			0
' you could create an image in 15 to 20 minutes , it was the first instant photography really			0
' like a shot of film , it 's all got to be done in a dark room under red light			1
if it was n't it would just ruin the plate			0
' it would also be ruined if the collodion dried before you got a chance to develop it			0
it 's a short window of about 20 minutes			0
' my grandfather made a toolbox during the @entity99 and i 've inherited it			0
' it 's basically a suitcase but it folds out and it 's got this hood that covers the top half of your body and you have all your chemicals inside the box and i can work from that box inside the van anywhere			2
' although it 's a bit tricky from @entity172 , the highest point in the city			0
it was probably the windiest day i 've experienced and i had to get my friend to hold down the dark room while i worked			1
' i think we 're a bit overwhelmed with digital images and camera phones now and this technique involves people going out of their way to do something a little bit more interesting			2
' anyone can take a photo and whack an @entity13 filter on it , and i do it too			0
but with this you have to really think about composition and exposure			0
' technical : the tintype method , demonstrated by this picture of toy robots , has to be done in a dark room under a red light @entity19 , of @entity105 , stands next to the @entity6 bellows camera which he restored to working order to produce stunning images the photographer , pictures in his studio , said : ' i think we 're a bit overwhelmed with digital images and camera phones now ' pictured , the @entity210 's @entity209 , which forms part of @entity19 's @entity6 album the camera had been lying in an attic for at least 70 years - the stand had been destroyed by woodworm and the bellows were in tatters the photographer has created a portable dark room in the back of his van , pictured above on the banks on the @entity224			1

@entity19 , of @entity105 , uses @entity6 bellows camera in method called tintype photography - popular in 1850s
process is all done in a dark room under a red light and uses a metal plate coated in chemicals to produce the effect
mr @entity19 is trying to resurrect 150 - year - old art form and says it 's far more interesting than using a camera phone
