by @entity0 many women around the world dream of being able to eat whatever they want and have any weight they gain go straight to their cleavage			0
but with the stereotypical perfect female body being both very slender yet with large breasts most women fight a constant battle between avoiding the snack aisle and bemoaning their shrinking assets			0
however one confectionery maker in @entity16 aims to bring women the best of both worlds , creating ' @entity21 ' cookies that claim to enhance breast size			2
each cookie contains 50mg of @entity24 , plant extract found in plant found in northern and north eastern @entity26 the makers say that eating just two a day will create a noticeable difference in breast size , and they have spread in popularity not only through @entity16 but other parts of @entity31			1
subtly named ‘ f cup cookies ’ the biscuits contain 50mg of @entity24 ( a plant extract found in plant in northern and north eastern @entity26 ) extract per cookie			0
the plant @entity24 contains a molecule similar to oestrogen known as @entity39 which mimics the biological activities of the hormone			1
human oestrogen plays an important role in breast development and determining their size , and the @entity21 cup cookies claim that the @entity39 in the biscuits will act in the same way on the body when eaten			2
most women fight a constant battle between avoiding the snack aisle and bemoaning their shrinking assets while eating boob - boosting cookies might sound great , there is no scientific evidence at all that @entity39 has a similar effect to oestrogen on humans when eaten however , while the idea of the only consequence of indulging in sweet treats being a larger cup size might sound appealing , there is no scientific evidence at all that @entity39 has a similar effect to oestrogen on humans when eaten			1
it also has been claimed – though in a similarly unproven manner – that @entity24 extract can be taken to increase appetite , which , if true may well increase a person ’s breast size through increased fat but is unlikely to be noticed as the weight gain will occur on the entire body			1
nutrition expert @entity78 says : ' phytoestrogens are in numerous foods and to date there is no research to show that ingestion changes breast size			0
‘ even concentrated doses have n't been shown to do anything , although eating several biscuits can lead to weight gain with all that goes with it			0

cookies sold in @entity16 *promise* to have noticeable effect on cup size
contain extract of plant @entity24 which contains @entity39
@entity39 acts similarly to the hormone oestrogen
however , while oestrogen does effect breast size , no evidence eating @entity24 has any impact
