many feared outside influences were at play as @entity13 , who lives in an nursing home in @entity15 , @entity16 , had said for decades she wanted to kill a @entity2 to be her only published novel			1
earlier @entity16 's @entity32 had sent an investigator to speak with her , and said that she answered their questions well enough to convince them she made her own decision , and knew what was happening with her book			2
the @entity29 investigation remained open for a time , but spokesman @entity40 has confirmed that they are now also satisfied that nothing is amiss			0
earlier suspicions had in part been fired by the fact that @entity13 's attorneys had announced the release , due in july , and that publishing house @entity48 had not had any direct contact with her			1

go set a @entity27 , a 304 - page novel , is a sequel to to kill a mockingbird , although @entity13 actually wrote it in the mid- 1950s , before @entity2			1
@entity78 and new : go set a watchman is a sequel to to kill a mockingbird - though @entity13 actually wrote it before the best - selling novel which secured her reputation the new novel will feature @entity85 , @entity87 's protagonist , as an adult woman returning to @entity2 , @entity16 from @entity89 20 years after the events of to kill a mockingbird			1

' it features the character known as @entity85 as an adult woman , and i thought it a pretty decent effort			0
my editor , who was taken by the flashbacks to @entity85 's childhood , persuaded me to write a novel ( what became ' @entity2 ' ) from the point of view of the young scout			2
' i was a first - time writer , so i did as i was told			0
i had n't realized it ( the original book ) had survived , so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer @entity53 discovered it			0
not happy to see him : reporter @entity120 received this blunt , handwritten ' go away ! ' from @entity0 when he asked her repeatedly for an interview ' after much thought and hesitation , i shared it with a handful of people i trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication			0
i am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years			0
' according to publisher @entity0 , @entity130 came upon the manuscript at a ' secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of to kill a mockingbird			0
' @entity13 has refused to comment further on the novel , helping fire suspicions about her mental state			0
