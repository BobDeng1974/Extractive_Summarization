former @entity1 presenter @entity0 has provoked outrage by suggesting ‘ rape is n’t always rape ’ when the victim is drunk , with a boyfriend , or has gone ‘ too far ’ in leading a man on			1
in a new book , @entity0 adds that it has become ‘ sacrilege to suggest there can be any gradation : rape is rape			1
’ ‘ yet the real experts , the victims , know otherwise			2
@entity0 wrote in his new book that ' not all rape is rape ' and said that some situations are more complicated ‘ half of all women who have had penetrative sex unwillingly do not think they were raped and this proportion rises strongly when the assault involves a boyfriend , or if the woman is drunk or high on drugs : they led him on , they went too far , it was n’t forcible , they did n’t make themselves clear			1
‘ for them , rape is n’t always rape and , however upsetting , they feel it is a long way removed from being systematically violated or snatched off the street			2
’ although he insists he is not blaming victims and criticises the ‘ booze culture ’ , mr @entity0 ’s remarks were yesterday condemned as outdated , misogynistic and immensely damaging by anti-rape campaigners			1
@entity30 , a trustee of @entity31 , said : ‘ i feel absolute fury			0
i really thought we had moved on from such outdated and ridiculous viewpoints			0
the comments have sparked fury with feminist groups speaking out against them ‘ i feel sad for the thousands of women who will read these views and believe that finally they have the validation that they must have been to blame – because @entity0 says so			1
‘ such comments do immense damage to victims of sexual violence			0
they prevent them from coming forward for the help they need			0
these comments are ill - advised , uneducated and quite simply wrong			0
’ and @entity50 , with which mr @entity0 has worked as a ‘ media partner ’ , said mr @entity0 ’s views were his own and it did not share them			1
in an extract from his new book @entity56 , published in today ’s @entity57 , mr @entity0 suggests victims who do not report the crime to the police might sometimes be right not to do so , adding : ‘ what if she feels partly responsible for what happened ? ’ he also draws parallels between some rape victims and ‘ foolish ’ people who have their laptops stolen because they leave them on the back seat of their cars			1
@entity0 cited ' booze culture ' as one of the reasons that the situation is more complicated			1
he added that our forebears would have been shocked with how women behave these days mr @entity0 , best known for co-hosting @entity78 ’s @entity1 with the late @entity79 , adds : ‘ rape victims were once treated appallingly , as though it was all their fault			1
but have we gone too far the other way ? many victims seem to think we have			0
’ he continues : ‘ we would laugh at a bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door			2
we would be aghast if an airport badly skimped on its security			0
‘ our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement			0
‘ not even in the licentious days of the @entity94 in the 17th @entity95 was it acceptable for women to dress as provocatively as they have done in @entity99 culture since the 1960s			0
‘ equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted , stay out late , often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss , grope or go to bed with one - night stands			2
‘ no amount of temptation can excuse rape , or any other crime			2
yet for some it is heresy to suggest that victims should ever be held responsible at all			0
’ the former journalist , who is now involved in the academic study of crime , relies on academic research for the claim that many women who have been subject to non-compliant sex do not regard themselves as having been raped			0
@entity0 is famous for presenting @entity1 with the late presenter @entity79 one research paper , published in the @entity121 in september 2003 , said it had confirmed a number of earlier studies that had found that fewer than half of victims categorised their experience as rape			2
the research , which questioned 89 victims , also found that women were more likely to believe they were raped if their attacker was not their boyfriend , if they experienced a more forceful assault or if the experience was particularly upsetting			0
mr @entity0 challenges those who say all cases should be reported to the police : ‘ the assumption is that any woman who chooses not to pursue a claim is being let down by the @entity140 or is acting irrationally			1
‘ but could it be that she is right ? what if she feels partly responsible for what happened ? what if she realises there is no evidence other than her word against his ? what if her life is bound up with that of her assailant ? what if she feels humiliated as well as violated ? should she be expected to disclose all this in public and put her life on hold for the greater good ? ’ in separate comments to @entity57 , mr @entity0 said the ‘ last thing ’ he wanted to do was to blame women for their misfortune			1
but he added : ‘ if it was a one - night stand and things got out of hand and she was drunk and he was drunk , it would be absurd to say she did not contribute			0
’ but critics last night insisted mr @entity0 was suggesting some women were at least partly to blame if they were raped			1
@entity170 , a spokesman for the @entity171 , said : ‘ @entity0 sticks with very tired and deeply misogynistic prejudices about “ provocative dress ”			1
this is an appalling misrepresentation of what actually happens			0
’ and @entity176 , chief executive officer of the @entity177 , said : ‘ does @entity0 think all women and girls should lock themselves away or wear a chastity belt because men and boys are not expected to monitor and control their behaviour ? ’			2

@entity0 has provoked outrage by suggesting ‘ rape is n’t always rape ’
he said that it is more complicated if the woman is with her boyfriend
also said that if woman is drunk or has led a man on are reasons for doubt
feminist groups accuse him of being ' deeply misogynistic ' in a *furious* *backlash*
