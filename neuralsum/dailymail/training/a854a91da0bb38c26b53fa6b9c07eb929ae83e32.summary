tough federal legislation is the only way to deal with what he called a ' national epidemic , ' he said at a distracted - driving summit in @entity16 , @entity17 , that drew doctors , advocates and government officials on thursday			1
@entity2 said it is important for the police to have ' the opportunity to write tickets when people are foolishly thinking they can drive safely or use a cell phone and text and drive			0
' national epidemic : @entity3 transportation secretary @entity2 , pictured in 1998 , called for a federal law to ban talking on a cell phone or texting while driving @entity2 has previously criticized behind - the - wheel use of cell phones and other devices , but calling for a federal law prohibiting the practice takes his effort to a new level			1
the @entity38 estimates that 3,000 fatal traffic accidents nationwide last year were the result of distracted driving			1
using a cell phone while driving delays reaction time the same amount as having a blood alcohol concentration of .08 , the legal limit , the highway agency said			1
but @entity49 , president of the @entity50 , said laws banning specific actions like talking on a phone or texting are not necessary because those actions are already covered by existing distracted - driving laws			1
it would be more productive , he said , to invest resources in campaigns that discourage inattentive driving in general			2
' it should n't matter if the driver is distracted by a conversation with another vehicle passenger , tuning the radio , eating a snack , or talking on a cell phone , ' @entity49 said in a statement			2
' existing laws cover all those distractions and more			0
' dangerous : the @entity38 estimates that 3,000 fatal traffic accidents nationwide last year were the result of distracted driving @entity2 said , however , he was not as concerned about people who eat , apply makeup , or perform other distracting activities in cars because ' not everyone does that			1
' ' but everyone has a cell phone and too many of us think it is ok to talk on our phones while we are driving , ' he said at the summit , sponsored by insurance company @entity86 , the @entity87 and @entity88			2

such accidents are ' 100 per cent preventable , ' he said			0
he compared the situation facing the @entity3 today with the problem of drunk driving 20 to 30 years ago			1
' it used to be that if an officer pulled you over for drunk driving , he would pat you on the back , maybe call you a cab or take you home , but he would n't arrest you , ' @entity2 said			2
' now that has changed , and the same enforcement can work for people who talk on cell phones while driving			0
' thirty - eight states have laws restricting or outlawing the use of electronic devices while driving , @entity2 said			0
@entity2 said his department was researching the effect that hands - free devices and new systems like @entity118 's @entity117 have on distracting drivers			0
