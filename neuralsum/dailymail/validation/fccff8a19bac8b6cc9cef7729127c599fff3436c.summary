the city had been celebrating their new team all weekend ahead of the match ; a festival atmosphere enveloping the place the day before and starting again with barbecues outside the @entity94 well before the game			2
football is a team game , but this was very much about one man : @entity1			2
two teams were making their @entity24 debuts in front of a sold out 63,000 - strong crowd , but the @entity3 , considered the greatest player on the planet in 2007 , was playing the lead role			2
he did not let down his adoring fans			0
his mere presence on the pitch whipped the striking purple crowd into a frenzy , from the moment he led the side out ahead of kick off for the very first time , introducing city to their new team			0
it took only two minutes for him to make his mark			0
just placing a ball for a free kick drew pandemonium around the @entity121 , but he delivered a ball into the box which @entity40 , on loan from @entity125 , headed inches wide of the left post			2
the home side dominated , and @entity1 was the catalyst for everything			2
he nudged the ball with his thigh , 12 minutes in , travelling outside the area with its momentum and hitting a left - foot shot just wide			0

his $ 7,167,500 salary is mammoth , but so is the responsibility on his shoulders to carry the team			0
he showed yet another example of what he will bring for that in the 23rd minute , picking the ball up 10 yards outside the area and turning quickly to change the direction of play to pass to @entity41 free on the left , who shot narrowly over			0
two minutes later , the crowd were raising from their seats , straining to get a better look , as he drove forward with the ball on the left , tried to get in between two defenders then eventually got a shot away			0
when @entity41 , formerly of @entity150 , @entity182 and @entity183 , produced a 360 spin to beat an opponent , there was clearly a touch of @entity187 to his thinking			0
this was not to forget that former @entity29 forward @entity28 , another of the league ’s newest stars , was making his debut for @entity6 where he will be teaming up with @entity193 when the @entity195 midfielder joins in the summer			1
but while @entity1 took to the league straight away , @entity32 had a frustrating evening			1
@entity5 fans clad in purple get behind their team in sunday 's inaugural match this fan had fully entered into the spirit of the occasion , wearing a purple face mask @entity5 line up for their first - ever competitive fixtures against @entity6 ew @entity144 goalkeeper @entity57 ( left ) clears the ball with a brave punch @entity1 ( right ) @entity144 's @entity65 clears the ball under pressure from @entity43 ( left ) @entity144 's @entity68 ( right ) moves the ball past @entity38 of @entity5 @entity144 's @entity61 ( left ) clears the ball while keeper @entity57 makes a save ( right ) the @entity121 was filled to its 62,500 capacity as @entity24 arrived in @entity5 supporters get behind the new team with colourful purple streamers and banners at the @entity121 the match was played beneath blues skies at the @entity121 as @entity5 welcomed the @entity24 he was involved , however , when @entity6 almost took a surprise lead on the break after 67 minutes			1
for all @entity5 ’s domination , their opponents broke from inside their own half and worked the ball quickly to @entity32 who passed into substitute @entity229			2
he shot hard a low across goal but just wide			0
but they did go in front , in the 76th minute			0
@entity32 was involved again , passing to @entity12 who took a touch and before curling an effort into the right of goal			1
when @entity240 was sent off late on for a two - footed lunge on @entity32 , it looked like for all @entity1 ’s efforts he would end his first game in @entity245 goalless and in defeat			1
but , like all great players , he produced when it mattered most .			0

@entity6 began their @entity24 history with a 1 - 1 draw with @entity5
