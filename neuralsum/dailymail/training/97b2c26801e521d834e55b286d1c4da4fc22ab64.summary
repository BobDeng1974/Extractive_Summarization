her wardrobe boasts rack upon rack of designer dresses and her jewellery collection includes £ 800 diamond earrings and a £ 2,800 @entity8 watch			2
she surely would n’t dream of venturing out without her £ 150 @entity10 handbag , and on chilly days , wrapping up in one of her four £ 190 cashmere and fox fur capes is a must			1
the only dilemma @entity16 might face is which pair of shoes to select from the neat rows of sparkly £ 70 designer numbers that line her boudoir			1
not that it particularly matters – because @entity16 is just five months old , and of course , she ca n’t yet walk			2
@entity16 's wardrobe boasts rack upon rack of designer dresses and her jewellery collection includes £ 800 diamond earrings and a £ 2,800 @entity8 watch			1
she is pictured with her 20 - year - old mother , @entity29 , who lives near @entity30 with her parents @entity16 is pictured above left wearing a £ 190 fox fur cape , and , right , wearing her @entity8			1
‘ i want her to have it all , and to have the money to do whatever she wants to			0
when @entity16 is in one of her big dresses she is so happy and smiley because she gets so much attention , ' said single mother @entity29 , who runs a beauty parlour her vast array of flouncy dresses , frou - frou bonnets and frilly tutu skirts – not forgetting her £ 10 crystal and diamante - encrusted dummy – comes courtesy of her 20 - year - old mother @entity50 and a set of doting grandparents who have spent a fortune blinging up baby			1
her mother confesses her ‘ ultimate dream is for @entity16 to be the new @entity57 ’ – a reference to the popular @entity60 reality series featuring child beauty pageant contestant @entity57			1
it attracted up to 3million viewers , but also received complaints that it exploited children , with one @entity60 critic calling it ‘ a horror story posing as a reality television programme ’			2
but for the moment , all of that is of little concern to @entity16			2
as befitting a star in the making , she travels in style thanks to a fleet of nine £ 1,450 prams , selected on the day to match her outfit			1
if she ever gets a tv or movie audition it would be almost unthinkable that her fine , downy hair would not have been blow - dried and set with her pink @entity86 rollers			0
afterwards , she could relax in her £ 400 pastel - pink bathtub , before dozing off in a 200 - year - old crib , recently restored and valued at a hiccup - inducing £ 2,000			2
and if that was n’t enough , for @entity90 she ’ll be getting a £ 3,000 handmade princess bed and a £ 500 ride - on toy @entity93			0
grotesque over-indulgence ? or simply an enterprising young mother trying to make sure her precious daughter has all she needs for a path to stardom ? ‘ everything i do is for @entity16 and to make things easier for her when she grows up , ’ says miss @entity16 , a single mother who runs a beauty parlour and lives near @entity30 with her parents @entity100 , 39 , and 52 - year - old @entity101 , a blacksmith with a successful wrought iron business			1

‘ if the time comes when she does n’t want to be dressed up , then i will throw away all the big dresses and buy her the outfits she does want to wear			0
' i ’ll be disappointed , but it will be entirely up to her			0
’ so far @entity16 – a perfectly adorable , contented baby – has enjoyed remarkable success in beauty pageants and fashion shows and has had various offers from model agencies			1
she even has her own @entity129 page to keep friends and followers updated on her photoshoots and burgeoning career – but perhaps inevitably , it has drawn occasional cruel comments			0
‘ when we are out , ’ miss @entity16 says , ‘ people will say nice things , stuff like “ look at that baby with her @entity10 bag ! ”			2
‘ but online , people have said some negative stuff			0
' that ’s just their opinion			0
they are of course entitled to it , but i think they are probably just jealous			0
