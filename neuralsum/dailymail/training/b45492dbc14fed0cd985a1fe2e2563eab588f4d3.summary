some vulnerable elderly people are sent a different carer every week to look after their most personal needs , a think - tank claimed yesterday			1
in some cases , it said , frail pensioners must allow 50 people a year into their homes to help them with vital everyday care such as dressing and washing			1
the problem has resulted from a high turnover of care workers , according to an inquiry commission headed by former care minister @entity16			1
‘ some care recipients have reported having 50 different care workers in their home over a year , ’ it said			1
some pensioners being looked after in their own homes are seeing up to 50 different workers a year ( file picture ) the claim follows deepening concern at the 15 - minute visit system that many care workers funded by local councils have to work under			1
these strict time - tables leave them no more than a quarter of an hour with each elderly person they are helping			2
vulnerable residents can be given different carers each week in areas where the firms that supply care services are unable to recruit enough staff , said the commission			1
it examined a diary kept by an anonymous care worker in the @entity44 , saying : ‘ although she is familiar with most of the people she sees and can provide continuity of care , some of her time is spent covering areas where the company she works for is short - staffed			1
‘ this means that she is unlikely to have seen these people before and may never see them again			2
‘ she becomes part of the parade of unfamiliar workers who may come into someone ’s bedroom and bathroom and take care of their intimate personal care needs			2
’ staff turnover at care provider firms is running at 20 per cent a year , twice the average for firms in all sectors of the economy , said the inquiry led by the former @entity72 minister			1
one reason for discontent , it said , is that 220,000 out of 685,000 carers are paid only for the time they spend inside people ’s homes			1
travel from one home to another is not included			0
‘ this means that where there is significant travel time between appointments , particularly in relation to the amount of paid - for contact time , care workers ’ effective wage can be less than the minimum wage , ’ said the commission			0
former care and support minister @entity16 's damning report says that the service – designed to free up beds by keeping people out of hospital – is ‘ not working ’ ‘ this is illegal			1
to make matters worse , it is also common practice for compassionate care workers to give a little extra time to their clients when care slots seem inadequate			0
‘ while this is the kind of person we would want to look after an aged parent , this puts their effective hourly wage further at risk			0
’ pay is depressed further as zero - hours contracts are used for six in ten care workers , the report said			2
it called for councils to pay more so staff receive the ‘ living wage ’ of £ 9.15 an hour in @entity125 and £ 7.85 outside			0
this means local authorities would have to pay £ 21.33 an hour to firms employing carers in the capital and £ 18.59 elsewhere , said the report			2
thousands of dementia patients living in their own homes are not getting enough help from carers or their gp , another report has warned			1
almost half do not feel they are supported by their family doctor – or offered regular check - ups			0
a fifth are not given enough help with basic tasks at home such as cooking and washing and the same proportion feel they have no control over their lives			0
@entity154 – an umbrella group of charities behind the report – is calling for an overhaul of dementia care			2
issued by the @entity160 think - tank , it added that care workers should be better trained and their jobs held in higher regard			0
it also called for them to be given ‘ key worker ’ status to help them find housing			0
the @entity169 , which represents councils , said : ‘ we rely on care workers to keep our social care system running and support people who can often have complex needs			1
‘ it is important they are paid a fair wage and have the best possible training and local authorities understand and take account of the cost of providing this			0
‘ the backdrop of 40 per cent cuts to local government funding during the current @entity186 and increasing pressure from @entity188 to drive down the costs of care have forced councils to ask providers to run services on tighter margins			0
’ the call for care workers to be paid the living wage comes at a time when even employers sympathetic to higher pay are finding difficulties putting this into practice			0
last year , the @entity203 admitted that it employed 70 workers on less than the living wage in its sheltered housing scheme for retired clergy .			0
