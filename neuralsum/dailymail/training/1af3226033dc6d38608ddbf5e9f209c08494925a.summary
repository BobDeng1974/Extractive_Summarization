another day another diver ! referees are struggling to accurately identify what is simulation and what is n’t in the @entity5			1
there is an inconsistent approach to this major issue and makes you consider the subjectivity of a lot of the incidents			0
however , the three others should have been booked too			0
@entity35 ( centre ) brandishes a yellow card to @entity38 , wrongly , after believing he dived during the match @entity35 ( right ) booked @entity27 's @entity23 for diving against @entity28 at @entity25 on saturday @entity23 ( left ) goes down under a challenge from @entity42 , who tried to pull away from it @entity44 ( obscured , centre ) goes down theatrically in the box for @entity27 against @entity28 @entity48 's @entity47 ( left ) was rightly booked for simulation against @entity50 @entity52 's @entity51 ( bottom ) goes down in the penalty area but no decision was given either way previous weekend : the weekend before similar issues were highlighted in the @entity5 : then , of course , the most startling caution for simulation this season came on november 30 when @entity62 decided that @entity64 's @entity63 had dived and cautioned him after he was clearly wiped out by @entity65 against @entity66 at @entity67			1
@entity68 ( right ) was wrongly booked for diving after being brought down by @entity70 @entity71 ( left ) appeared to go down theatrically in the box against @entity73 the difficulty in detecting what is clear is that the select group of referees in the @entity5 are unable to consistently detect and punish the guilty parties whilst protecting those who are fouled			1
this is partly down to the ability of the referees themselves but mostly due to the players and their approach			0
there is a tendency now for players to do two things which fuel the fire of inconsistency and they were in evidence this weekend			2
exaggerating contact : @entity52 ’s @entity51 appeared to feel slight contact on his boot from behind as he was running into the penalty area			1
he stubbed his toe into the turf - which only he can know if that was deliberate - and went sprawling down			0
he certainly looked for a penalty and was clearly annoyed when @entity99 failed to award one			0
had he been heading straight towards goal with a good chance to score then i am sure he would have stayed on his feet and tried to get a second for @entity52			2
@entity51 ( left ) appeared to feel slight contract from behind and then stubbed his toe into the turf anticipating contact : @entity27 ’s @entity38 saw @entity110 dangle a leg out in front of him and felt that , had he continued his normal run , he would have been knocked to the ground and perhaps injured			1
therefore , to avoid contact with @entity110 ’s leg , he went over it			0
i would argue that the @entity28 player 's action impeded his progress and so it was a foul			2
however , when @entity38 ’s team - mate @entity44 thought that two @entity28 defenders were going to impede him , he jumped through the middle of them			1
they had withdrawn from their act and therefore @entity44 had dived			2
@entity38 ( right ) was booked for simulation after a challenge on him from @entity110 the possible solutions replays : these decisions are fine margins and subtle differences which are so hard to get right at full speed in the intensity of major football matches			1
slow - motion replays help massively and as they are available it seems incongruous that the resource is not used			0
however , there appears to be no prospect of this being introduced in the foreseeable future			0
@entity27 centre back @entity44 ( left ) was left in shock by @entity35 's decision not to award him a penalty extra officials : the widely - respected @entity150 is in favour of additional match officials helping out in all aspects of the game and this includes simulation			1
i have seen no evidence to suggest this helps and the higher the number of different people who look at subjective situations , the less consistent the action tends to be			0
@entity35 did not buy the dive and rightly booked @entity23 for simulation against @entity28 retrospective action : a few ex-players have mooted the idea of a panel sitting after match days to adjudicate on incidents of simulation			1
i think this is an excellent option ; if just two people are allowed to sit together , perhaps an ex-player and a former referee , there will be greater consistency			0
they should sit and adjudicate on incidents on a monday and have the power to impose an immediate retrospective one - game ban for those found guilty who have already escaped the attention of the match - day referee			2
but referees should still be encouraged to detect and punish at the time and given additional training to ensure they think in harmony with the panel , of who only two should sit at any one time			0
what is clear is that some action is required - and quickly - before this spirals into an even bigger issue that affects every game			2
retrospective action should be introduced for incidents such as @entity44 's dive against @entity28			1

there were lots of *contentious* decisions in @entity5 this weekend
simulation is returning to the game and it needs to be *eradicated*
here , @entity14 's @entity13 talks through how to resolve this *problem*
@entity27 ’s @entity23 and @entity38 cautioned for simulation while @entity44 was not during the @entity215 ' 2 - 0 victory over @entity28 .
@entity217 awarded a penalty for @entity219 for what appeared to be a dive against @entity222 . the @entity219 scored the penalty and the match finished 1 - 1 .
@entity48 ’s @entity47 cautioned for simulation during the 1 - 0 victory against @entity50 .
@entity52 ’s @entity51 neither cautioned nor awarded a free - kick when going to ground at @entity229 . spurs won the match 2 - 1 .
the caution of @entity68 when he was fouled by @entity70 during @entity64 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity235 .
the *unpunished* dive by @entity71 for @entity219 in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity73 .
