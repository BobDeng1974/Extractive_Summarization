by @entity1 reporter published : 00:46 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 07:41 est , 31 may 2013 a @entity3 mother of seven who was jailed in @entity5 on drug smuggling charges walked free last night after a surveillance video cleared her of transporting marijuana			1
@entity9 , 42 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , was greeted by well - wishers as she left the lockup on the outskirts of @entity15 and hugged her husband , @entity16 , as officials closed the jail doors behind her			1
' i 'm home ! finally ! ' @entity20 screamed as she crossed the border back into @entity11			1
@entity20 was arrested by the @entity5 military last week after they found nearly 12 pounds ( 5.4 kilograms ) of pot under her seat on the commercial bus traveling from @entity5 to @entity11			1
the case prompted outrage in the @entity43 among politicians and pitted the conservative @entity3 family against a judicial system that has long struggled with corruption			1
her release came hours after court officials reviewed security footage that showed her and her husband boarding a bus in @entity5 with only blankets , bottles of water and her purse in hand			1
the judge determined that she was no longer a suspect and all allegations against her were dropped , according to @entity40			0
she spoke briefly to reporters clustered outside the jail , saying : ' many thanks to everyone , especially my @entity64 who let me go free , my family , my children , who with their help , i was able to survive this test			2
' with that she and her husband walked hand in hand to a waiting car , departing for the @entity43 border several miles away			1
once in @entity15 , @entity11 , she spoke again about her ordeal			0
decision : the judge determined that she was no longer a suspect and all allegations against her were dropped , according to @entity40 relieved : @entity9 and her husband embraced for a considerable duration as she walked of jail release : @entity9 is seen leaving the complex hand - in - hand with her husband @entity16 on thursday night ' i love @entity5 , ' said @entity20 , who was born there			1
' my family is still there			0
so @entity5 ... it 's not @entity5 's fault			1
it 's a few people who you know did this to me			0
' but speaking to @entity11 's 12 news , she added : ' i 'm not coming back to @entity5			1
it 's a slap in the face @entity5 has given me after i 've defended them when i hear people talk bad about them			2
' a judge had until late friday to decide whether to free her or send her to another prison in @entity5 while state officials continued to build their case			2
@entity20 said earlier on thursday he was confident that the video would exonerate his wife , and suggested a man sitting behind them who fled the scene could have been responsible for the drugs			1
mr @entity20 was originally arrested after the pot was found under his wife 's bus seat on a commercial bus traveling from @entity5 to @entity111 as they returned from her aunt 's funeral			1
separated : @entity9 was with her husband @entity16 , both pictured , when they were stopped in @entity5 and accused of smuggling drugs			1
mr @entity20 remains in a @entity5 prison family : the couple , who have seven children between them after @entity9 begged the soldiers to allow her to come along to serve as translator , the military officials decided to release him and arrest her instead , he said			1
@entity40 , who had also predicted to reporters that the video would lead to her freedom , noted that it was a fairly sophisticated smuggling effort that included packets of drugs attached to the seat bottoms with metal hooks - a task that would have been impossible for a passenger like @entity20			1
' all the evidence they have is the drug under the seat , ' he said			0
the @entity140 were traveling home to the @entity111 suburb of @entity10 after attending her aunt 's funeral in the city of @entity146 when they were arrested			0
the couple took the bus because they thought it would be safer than driving			0
they had taken a similar bus during a separate trip in @entity5			2
@entity20 said authorities originally demanded $ 5,000 for her release , but the bribe fell through			2
shocked : mrs @entity9 said she never saw the drugs she is accused of smuggling - not even after she was arrested when the couple tried to defend themselves , military officials told them the court would sort it out , @entity20 said			1
' we never thought this would ever happen , ' said @entity20 , who does n't speak @entity167 and could n't understand the court proceedings involving his wife			2
@entity20 said a man sitting behind them on the bus fled during the inspection			1
he believes the man might have been the true owner of the drugs			1
' we think she is being framed , ' he said			0
' the bus was already [ en route ] from @entity179 ' when they boarded			0
@entity9 said she does not think she was necessarily targeted			2
' someone smuggled those in there , and i probably sat in the wrong seat , ' she said			0
@entity5 officials provided local media with photos that they said were of the packages @entity20 is accused of smuggling			1
each was about 5 inches high and 20 inches wide , roughly the width of a bus seat			0
the marijuana was packed into plastic bags and wrapped in tan packing tape			0
@entity9 said she has been relying on her faith and the support of her family to keep her spirits up as she fights for her freedom			2
evidence ? @entity5 officials claim these are the marijuana bundles that were found under @entity9 's bus seat ' i 've been reading the scriptures , reading the @entity206 , praying , fasting , ' @entity20 told @entity208 before her release			1
' and all the support that i 've been getting from my family , my husband , my children , and everybody out there reaching out to help			0
' in the tearful interview - which @entity20 gave from what appears to be an office in @entity15 , @entity5 , federal prison - the devout @entity3 mother said she was shocked when the drugs were found			1
' i was at the checkpoint			0
they asked us to get off bus			0
and they were checking for drugs or i do n't know what else , ' she said			0
' and they say they found something under my seat			2
but i never saw anything			0
they did n't show me anything			0
it was just amazing all that , what they did			0
' in the interview , @entity20 said she is a religious family woman who was innocent of the charges leveled against her			2
' i 'm a good mom			0
and we work hard to have what we have			0
you know , we 're not rich , but we 're very honest and we always do our best to help other people , ' she said			0
@entity20 's family has accused the army officers of framing her in an effort to extort a bribe			2
drug traffickers have increasingly been using passenger buses to move @entity43 - bound drugs through @entity5			1
in a notorious case , federal police in 2011 found half a ton of marijuana hidden under the seats of a bus headed to @entity263 , across the border from @entity265 , @entity266			1
they arrested the driver and two other people			0
federal agents and soldiers have set up checkpoints throughout @entity5 's main highways and have routinely seized cocaine , marijuana , heroin and other illegal drugs from buses			1
when drug suspects are arrested in @entity5 , they face a murky situation			2
@entity5 's justice system is carried out largely in secret , with proceedings done almost entirely in writing			2
' innocent ' : the @entity140 , who are @entity3 , said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs ' bribes ' : the couple were told they could pay off the judge because ' that 's how things work here ' four years ago , @entity5 decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana , cocaine and heroin , but it still has stiff penalties for drug trafficking			1
@entity5 law does n't specify a minimum or maximum sentence in drug crimes and leaves it up to the judge to decide how long the sentence should be , said @entity303 , a spokesman for federal prosecutors in @entity5			2
earlier this week , @entity40 presented testimony from @entity9 and from two relatives who accompanied the couple to the @entity146 bus station , and two fellow passengers on the bus			1
all four testified that she had not been carrying any drugs			0
he described her as depressed while in jail , but she had not been abused or mistreated			0

' she is sad because of the situation , in which she 's being accused of a crime she did n't commit			0
' on wednesday , an army lieutenant , a private and another sergeant were supposed to appear in court but they did not show up			0
the army did not explain why , @entity40 said			0
@entity9 is a naturalized @entity43 citizen who was born in @entity5 , her family said			1
she and @entity20 were married one year ago , and they celebrated their anniversary while she was jailed			2
@entity332 , a @entity333 spokeswoman , said @entity43 consulate officials in @entity5 had closely monitored the case			1
@entity333 officials visited her friday			0
' private citizens who travel abroad are expected to , of course , abide by the law in the country where they are visiting , and the consular office is in touch when cases like this arise to be helpful in advising , ' @entity332 said in a press briefing in @entity346 on wednesday ahead of the release .			0
