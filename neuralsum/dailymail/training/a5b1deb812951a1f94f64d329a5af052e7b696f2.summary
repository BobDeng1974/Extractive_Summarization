the @entity1 @entity0 was completely all over the place with so many things happening			2
we had a hybrid failure which was huge			1
the team thought that a problem of this kind would not allow us to finish the race because it affected both my brakes and the fuel			1
while the fuel turned out to be ok – but only just because we managed to save some under the safety car – looking after the brakes was a mission			1
during the race , we have to take care of the brakes anyway ; even if the hybrid had n't failed , it was still very critical			1
so , with the hybrid failing it became a huge issue , an almost impossible task from the point of view of the team , but we had to manage it			1
i had to reduce the amount i was using the rear brakes , so that meant braking much more with the front brakes , and i also lost in excess of 100 horsepower with the loss of hybrid power from the engine			1
so to finish second was a really good result when you take all of that into consideration			1
to be honest , i was surprised i managed to keep everybody behind me for as long as i did			1
i was banging in qualifying laps , really going for it , and the gap remained identical to the guys behind			2
i knew that if one of them passed me the whole train would get me			2
so i had to stay ahead of them			2
looking back , it 's funny because i did not know what position i was in			1
i was so slow , and i had a @entity73 , in @entity74 , behind me			2
i had also asked my engineer @entity75 to reduce communication because i wanted to focus			0
i knew the job i had to do whatever position i was in			0
i had to keep the guy who was behind me , behind me			0
i only realised i finished second after the race , and i was pretty happy with that because i thought it was a lot worse ! our aspirations are of course to win and dominate , but in hindsight i am pleased with the result			1
it was good damage limitation and what happened in @entity34 shows we are not bulletproof when it comes to reliability			0
the team has put a lot of energy into resolving that however , and i am very confident that the team can sort out anything , and i am sure they will find a solution to what happened			1
i 'll drink to that : @entity28 was pleased to have finished 2nd in @entity1 after a race plagued with reliability issues i am now 22 points clear of @entity105 in the championship			1
i feel the momentum has swung back a bit in my favour , and that is what i had to do , so i just need to keep it going now			1
the lead of the title race is certainly a good place to be in , but it is still early days and there is a long way to go			1
the psychological impact of beating @entity105 to pole in @entity1 was n't something i considered that much			1
@entity34 is a track like any other , and on any other circuit if i do a good job then i believe i will be quickest			0
i did not approach it in a different way , or consider it to be a " special " track , or " @entity105 's " track , because he has won there three times before			1
battle : @entity132 ( left ) and @entity28 went toe - to - toe in @entity1 for the race win before the former retired we will be bringing some updates on our braking system to the @entity137 @entity0 and that is great because it is a region where i still need to work on because i am not 100 per cent confident in that area			1
we have something new to try - we took an update to @entity34 and it did n't work - so i am looking forward to testing it out in @entity137 because i always look forward to something that has the potential to improve our car			1
other than that , i think the track will suit us , but at this moment in time any circuit suits us			0
we are just quick everywhere			0
but we must keep pushing because the opposition is also pushing			0
in @entity34 the gap was not quite as big as we expected , particularly in qualifying			0
@entity154 : the @entity156 columnist entertains the @entity137 crowd at the @entity158 on thursday cheer we go : @entity28 watches @entity159 in their opening @entity161 game against @entity162 i am a massive @entity159 fan , so i 've been loving the @entity161			0
the first game against @entity162 - where we won 4 - 0 - was just so cool			1
it is so emotional to follow them and watch them play and they are the favourites now after that performance			0
i visited them in their training camp before they left for @entity174 and you could see they were working well together and were enjoying a great atmosphere			0
externally , there had been some negative press towards them , but internally they were very , very strong and it was a privilege to visit them ahead of the @entity161			0
we fear the @entity185 , but @entity186 are one of the surprises of the @entity161			0
away from @entity174 , i went to @entity190 for a training camp			0
i also took the engineers out to a track day in @entity194 earlier this week			0
it was great for them to get a racing insight , and they all got to drive a proper single - seater car on their own so they could feel for the first time what it 's like to be a @entity206 driver			1
maybe now they will show a little bit more empathy towards me ! they had an instructor next to them for all the different experiences except for when they drove the single - seater car , so they really appreciated how difficult it is to listen whilst driving			2
that is a good thing , because now they will understand to keep the communication over the radio to me to a minimum during the races ! we also took part in a big @entity227 commercial at @entity228 on wednesday			0
they are using the @entity206 team to promote their road car technologies			2
we were filming with the race car out on track and did some funny things with the road car , too			2
@entity236 and @entity28 test their football skills ! team bonding : @entity28 enjoyed a track day with his @entity227 engineers at @entity241 earlier this week the news about @entity243 earlier this week was great and was so nice to hear			2
it is such a big , positive step because he has been in a coma for such a long time			2
i wish his family and friends a lot of strength and i wish him as good a recovery as possible			0
if someone can do that , then it is @entity243 because he was always such a fighter during his brilliant career			0
encouraging news : @entity256 is out of a coma following his skiing accident in @entity259 last december video fans react to @entity256 news @entity28 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity264 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity206 mechanics and their families , putting @entity206 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			0
you can follow @entity28 on @entity276 @ nico_rosberg and @entity277 @ @entity278			0

my team did n't think i *'d* make it to the end of the race after a hybrid failure
but we managed the problem and almost won - i was surprised i managed to keep everybody behind me for as long as i did !
the result leaves me 22 points clear of @entity132 in the championship
and i feel the momentum has swung back in my favour in battle for the title
