by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 17:08 est , 8 march 2014 fraternities are more powerful than the colleges and universities that host them , according to a new expose into their relationships with schools			1
the influence on campuses of fraternities is immense , from masses of off - site student housing to donations , fraternities control many aspects of life , according to an article in the @entity16 this month			1
the @entity16 also uncovered surprising numbers about crimes committed in fraternity homes – violence is the biggest problem , followed by sexual assaults and intoxication			1
fraternities soldier on through numerous hazing scandals because one out of every eight @entity46 college students lives off - campus in a fraternity house			1
off - campus housing relieves schools of costs involved with maintenance and insurance , and allows them to shift resources elsewhere			1
‘ getting rid of all that housing would be a huge problem for the colleges , ’ @entity32 told @entity55			2
the risk , though , of having all those students off - campus is that schools do n’t supervise students as they do in dormitories			1
no rules : many fraternities post rules of conduct , but members rarely follow them - excessive drinking and drug use often occurs this has led to dramatically higher incidents of assault and battery and sexual assault , the @entity16 ’s year - long investigation revealed			1
‘ these kids get liquored up and they get in horrible fights , ’ @entity32 continued			0
‘ there 's a kid in a coma in @entity83 … somebody punched him , roundhouse punch			0
he hit the cement , and he 's in a coma			0
’ that student was pummeled trying to break up a fight			0
the second-most committed crime is sexual assault , but @entity32 revealed fraternities are fairly transparent about the number of sexual assaults and more often than not deal with them appropriately			2
hazing is also surprisingly not nearly the problem many perceive it to be			0
‘ i had assumed before i wrote the piece that hazing was the number one problem … [ but ] hazing is the least common problem , it 's only seven per cent , ’ she said			0
not surprisingly though , many of the issues facing fraternities can easily be traced back to binge drinking - even non-violent or hazing - related deaths			2
perception flying in the face of actual reality has forced one fraternity to ban pledging beginning this sunday , @entity55 reported			0
the off - campus institutions are able to continue on despite all these issues because colleges do n’t want to shoulder the cost of housing the influx of on - campus students that would result from such a move , but also because they are worried about funding			1
another familiar sight : police tape blocking the front entrance an off - campus fraternity house , this one in @entity127 , @entity128 , near @entity129 fraternity members often give to both their school and their @entity37 organization			1
removing @entity34 from schools would result in alums of both limiting donations			2
‘ if a college president does something to the fraternity chapter that the fraternity men do n't like , they 'll cut the money off instantly , ’ @entity32 said			0
many successful people , including ceo ’s , cfo ’s , senators , governors and even a few presidents pledged fraternities during their college years , the article notes			0
‘ college presidents are n't as powerful against fraternities as people often think			0
’ the schools also face the dilemma of not realistically being able to limit students ’ off campus behaviors			1
‘ the university ca n't come and say , ' you ca n't belong to a private club that exists on a private land , ’ @entity32 explained			0
‘ it 's sort of like saying , ' you ca n't go to 7 - 11 off - campus , ' she continued			1
‘ you can go to 7 - 11 , you can go to the @entity163 , you can join the fraternity			2
’ and students do by the thousands each semester , something that will likely not change any time soon .			0

a new expose on @entity37 life aims to prove that fraternities wield more power than colleges or universities
the high numbers of students living in off - campus fraternity houses allow schools to shift resources to other areas
donations from alumni *cripple* the ability to *sanction* the highly - private organizations for *misconduct*
