by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 5 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:06 est , 5 february 2014 motorists could pay almost £ 200 a year more for petrol when a new green fuel is introduced in line with @entity9 rules , experts have warned			1
their tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient , increase @entity15 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles			1
it is set to be introduced because of an @entity9 directive saying that major suppliers must add environmentally friendly alternatives to petrol			1
new green fuel : tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient , increase @entity15 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles ( file picture ) many oil companies have decided to use bio-ethanol , made from corn , sugar cane and rapeseed			1
the new eco-fuel , @entity34 , contains 10 per cent bio-ethanol , compared with up to 5 per cent in the @entity37 unleaded blend currently on sale			1
the @entity39 requires 5 per cent of road transport energy to be from renewable sources this year , and 10 per cent by 2020 , in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming			2
but while ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol , it supplies around 30 per cent less energy			1
this means cars will use more of the new fuel , costing drivers more			1
tests by motoring magazine what car ? found that big , powerful cars coped better , while the small - engined models often bought by families on a budget were the worst affected			0
its tests showed cars ’ fuel economy fell by as much as 11.3 per cent , and by 8.4 per cent on average , with @entity34 compared to pure unleaded petrol			1
view : transport minister @entity65 said it was up to fuel sellers to decide how to meet @entity9 targets that is the equivalent of two extra full tanks a year , or £ 170 assuming both fuels cost the same , it said			0
the report added : ‘ apply this to all compatible cars and you ’re looking at a national annual fuel bill hike of £ 3.4billion			0
’ when the new fuel was compared with @entity37 , it said , ‘ the effect would be smaller but still significant ’			2
tests in the @entity83 – where car engines tend to be far bigger – showed falls in fuel economy of only 3 to 4 per cent			0
not every car can use @entity34 , which can melt , corrode and wreck some components in older engines			0
the @entity90 said 92 per cent of @entity92 cars are compatible with @entity34 , but that leaves around 1.5million vehicles , mostly those built before 2002 , potentially at risk			2
what car ? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump , hose filter and injector blockages			0
it is also corrosive to some seals , plastics and metals ‘ and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure ’			0
the fuel leads to increased @entity15 emissions from car exhaust pipes			0
however , green groups such as the @entity113 say this would be offset since crops used to make it absorb co2 as they grow			0
what car ? editor @entity119 called on the government to carry out its own tests			0
he said : ‘ to lead consumers into @entity34 without fully communicating the significant impact on fuel economy , particularly for drivers least able to absorb extra costs , is irresponsible			2
’ ' to lead consumers into @entity34 without fully communicating the significant impact on fuel economy , particularly for drivers least able to absorb extra costs , is irresponsible ' @entity119 , @entity129 ? editor transport minister @entity65 said it was up to fuel sellers to decide how to meet @entity9 targets			2
she said : ‘ any decision to supply @entity34 is very much a commercial decision for fuel suppliers and current regulations certainly do not require them to do this			2
’ @entity139 spokesman @entity138 said : ‘ i ’d prefer to see it delayed			0
’ @entity141 selling three million litres of fuel or more a year will have to offer both @entity37 and @entity34 until 2017 , though many smaller sites will have to choose which to provide			1
pumps dispensing fuel with more than 5 per cent ethanol , such as @entity34 , must be clearly labelled that it is not suitable for all vehicles .			1

major suppliers ' must add environmentally friendly alternatives to petrol '

@entity34 contains 10 ***%*** bio-ethanol , compared with 5 ***%*** in @entity37 unleaded blend
ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol but supplies 30 ***%*** less energy
this means cars will use more of the new fuel , costing drivers more
