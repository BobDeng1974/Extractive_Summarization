they are yet more proof of the red planet 's wet past			0
the @entity4 today released an astonishing series of pictures showing the remnants of a huge river than once ran across @entity9			1
taken by the @entity4 ’s @entity11 , they show @entity12 , the ' river - like structure ' is believed to have formed when running water flowed in the distant martian past			1
this computer - generated image of a river - like feature in the @entity12 region of @entity9 was created using data from the @entity11 spacecraft the images were taken from data collected in the @entity12 region of @entity9 , shown here it cut a steep - sided channel through the @entity26 before running on towards the floor of the vast @entity28			1
this astonishing structure , which stretches for almost 900 mile ( 1500 km ) across the martian landscape , is flanked by numerous tributaries , one of which can be clearly seen cutting in to the main valley towards the upper ( north ) side			2
experts say the images show a ' striking resemblance to the morphology found in regions on @entity41 affected by glaciation '			1
' for example , we can see circular step - like structures on the inner walls of the sediment - filled crater in the foreground of the second perspective view , ' @entity4 said			2
planetary scientists think that these may represent former high water or glacial levels , before ice and water sublimated or evaporated away in stages at various times			0
the new @entity11 image below shows a region of @entity12 at a point where the channel is almost 4 miles ( 7km ) wide and 1,000 feet ( 300m ) deep			1
the sides of @entity12 are particularly sharp and steep in these images , @entity4 said , with parallel longitudinal features covering the floor of the channel itself			0
the river - like channel is 7 km wide , and a depth of around 300m			1
it is believed to have been formed by flowing water , which cut through highland terrain and formed smooth plains			0
this colour - coded overhead view reveals the depth of the craters and river beds these structures are believed to be caused by the passage of loose debris and ice during the ‘ @entity84 ’ period ( which continues to this day ) due to glacial flow along the channel			2
the structures were formed long after it was originally carved by liquid water during the @entity91 period , which is believed to have ended between 3.5 billion and 1.8 billion years ago			0
similar lineated structures , believed to be rich in ice , can also be found in many of the surrounding craters			0
the @entity11 craft was also able to produce this 3d image of the area thanks to its twin cameras the right ( northern ) part of the main image is dominated by the @entity26 with their high and soft - rounded mountains shown in these images , rising around 2500 m above the surrounding flat plains			1
' the morphology of @entity12 suggests it has experienced a diverse and complex history , with analogies seen in glacial activity on @entity41			2
' these analogies are giving planetary geologists tantalising glimpses of a past on the @entity9 not too dissimilar to events on our own world today			0

experts say the images show a ' striking resemblance ' to areas of @entity41 affected by glaciation
