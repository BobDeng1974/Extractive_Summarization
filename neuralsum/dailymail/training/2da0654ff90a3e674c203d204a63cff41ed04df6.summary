following a week of speculation , and closer inspection , experts are still no closer to identifying exactly what the mystery crocodile - style object is buried in a @entity7 river			1
@entity8 supposedly bumped into the head of the ' rock ' last week , and it was apparently confirmed by scientists to be an ancient lizard or even a dinosaur			1
now a video has emerged which takes a closer look at the ' remains ' and several professors have told @entity18 ' it looks too good to be true and may be a hoax '			1
they supposedly found the crocodile - like head while on a fishing trip			1
and when they sent photos to experts they were told it was likely a lizard or dinosaur from 150 million years ago the discovery was made by fisherman from the @entity37 were travelling by boat down the @entity39 in the @entity40 of northern @entity41			1
their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder , but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance			2
several theories have been put forward for what this crocodile - like rock might be			1
so far experts have suggested the rock is about 150 million years old			1
the fisherman originally said that @entity57 scientists informed them it was a mesosaur , but if the age is correct that would be impossible , as mesosaurs lived from 299 to 270 million years ago			1
according to @entity64 it may have been a marine reptile called dakosaurus - maximus , which lived 161 to 100 million years ago , although more proof will be needed			1
other experts speaking to @entity64 agreed that it was likely a sea lizard rather than a dinosaur			1
however , speaking to @entity18 several professors and experts in paleontology have expressed their skepticism that the find is genuine , and say it might be a hoax			1
dr @entity76 , curator of natural sciences at @entity78 said : ' in this case it does look suspicious , especially in the way it ’s poking out of the river bed			0
' it ’s strange that it ’s so much larger than the surrounding cobbles , which would suggest that it has n’t been transported by the river			0
' if it is in its original position , then it should have been eroded away to a greater extent by the cobbles			0
it is also hard to judge the size of it			0
it does look rather as if somebody has planted it there			0
' although there is an overall impression of a skull with distinct tooth sockets , some of which have teeth in them , there would seem to be too many tooth positions for it to be @entity109 , but that is assuming it is real , and at the moment that is far from certain			2
' @entity37 chairman @entity113 said at the time : ‘ it was hard to miss , because the boat driven by my colleague @entity117 had bumped against it			0
when he looked to see what it was he found this huge head			2
’ following the recent inspection , professor @entity123 , head of @entity124 at @entity125 , told the @entity127 : ' we plan to go on an expedition to the river next year with scientists from the @entity40 to prove to the world that it is not a river stone but the remains of an ancient animal			1
' but @entity137 , a senior researcher from the @entity138 in @entity139 , was more sceptical			0
she said it looks like a big boulder , and there are no eye sockets nor any sign of a skull			0
but added ' it is just so bizarre looking			0
' following the find , club chairman @entity113 said the fishermen photographed it and when they got back they emailed the picture to the @entity151 in the city of @entity153 , @entity41			2
their scientists came back to them to say that they believed it was the fossilised remains of a lizard that had lived about 150 million years ago , reports @entity158			1
@entity160 's head @entity159 said that it was not the first report of fossil discoveries in the region but it was the first photographic evidence that the rumours were ' true '			2
he said all the indications were that there is possibly a wealth of similar fossils in the area			0
‘ we have dispatched an expedition there to investigate the remains and secure them for future study , ’ he said			2
‘ at this stage though it 's difficult to be precise about exactly what the find shows			2
’ the institute is confident that the remains have significant scientific value and they are hoping to recover them before the spring thaw washes them away			2
however , speaking to @entity18 other experts expressed their scepticism that the find was real			1
‘ if it looks too good to be true , it almost certainly is n’t , ’ dr @entity189 of the @entity190 told @entity18			1
the mystery object is circled in this image			0
professor @entity123 , head of @entity124 at @entity125 , believes it to be one of the first reptiles ‘ if it looks too good to be true , it almost certainly is n’t , ’ dr @entity189 of the @entity190 told @entity18			1
‘ if it was genuine , old and reworked then it would n’t be in the apparently good condition that the picture tries to suggest ‘ if it was genuine , old and reworked then it would n’t be in the apparently good condition that the picture tries to suggest			0
especially in the pebbly and erosive bed of a river			0
‘ my personal opinion is that someone has buried a stuffed crocodile - or even a large model - in a river bed in order to make some sort of mischief			1
’ and dr @entity217 , @entity218 in @entity219 at @entity220 , agrees : ‘ finding a fossil skull in the bid of a river is entirely feasible , but it would be a very lucky find to uncover a specimen as intact as illustrated , ’ he says			2
the discovery was made by fisherman from the @entity37 were travelling by boat down the @entity39 in the @entity40 peninsula of northern @entity41 ( shown )			2
their boat struck something that they initially thought was a boulder , but on closer examination had a somewhat more familiar appearance if true the find may have been a marine reptile called @entity109 ( illustration shown )			1
however speaking to @entity18 several professors expressed scepticism that the find was real and say it may be a hoax , with one saying it was ' too good to be true ' dr @entity243 of the @entity244 , @entity245 and environmental sciences at @entity220 says : ' without seeing an image of the specimen when it is not almost entirely covered with water it is impossible for me to determine if it is indeed a fossil - it may well turn out simply to be an odd shaped rock			1
' what look very superficially like teeth could easily be plants growing on the rock for example ! ' at this stage i don¹t think we can say anything about this and its potential scientific significance			0
i am skeptical as to whether it is even be a fossil			0
' scientists are trying to figure out if it is a ' @entity109 ' dating from the @entity271 and @entity272 periods , as @entity7 naturalist @entity273 argues , or a freak of nature , a rock appearing to have sharp teeth the discovery was made by fisherman from the @entity37 were travelling by boat down the @entity39 in the @entity40 of northern @entity41 and professor of vertebrate palaeontology @entity280 from @entity282 was particularly skeptical of the veracity of the find			1
' well , what can i say			0
it ’s a fake , ' he claims			0
' it looks a bit like the snout of a crocodile , maybe stuffed , maybe carved in wood , maybe fossil , set up in the pebbles on the bottom of the river and photographed as a student - style prank			2
' meanwhile professor @entity299 , a reader in @entity219 from the @entity300 and environmental sciences at the @entity302 says : ' the picture of the skull is unclear because of the water running over it , but first impressions suggest it is something with a long snout and pointed teeth			0
it could be a bear			0
' however , there is the possibility that it is is a much older fossil			0
' @entity7 is rich in @entity272 strata which might contain any number of fossils reptiles from marine mosasaurs [ a type of extinct marine reptile ] to terrestrial dinosaurs			1
but he adds : ' why on earth the guys did n't haul it out of the water to get a better view is beyond me			0
perhaps it is a hoax			0

fisherman in @entity7 claim to have found remarkably intact remains of an ancient lizard
they supposedly found the crocodile - like head while on a fishing trip
and when they sent photos to experts they were told it was likely a lizard or dinosaur from 150 million years ago
if true this may have been a marine reptile called @entity109 - maximus
a video has now emerged showing experts inspecting the find closer
however speaking to @entity18 several professors expressed skepticism that the find was real and say it may be a hoax
