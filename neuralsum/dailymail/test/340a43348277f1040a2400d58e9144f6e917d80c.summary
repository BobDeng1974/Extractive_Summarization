ahead of the 79th edition of the masters , @entity0 counts down the 20 greatest shots ever seen at @entity4			1
here are @entity5 10 - 1			2
click here for the first part of our countdown , featuring videos of shots from the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 and the late , great @entity15 ... 10 @entity16 , 1960 the @entity17 was truly crowned after becoming the first man to birdie both the final two holes at @entity4 to win the masters			1
@entity16 had already sunk a 35 - footer on the 17th to tie @entity22 at the top of the leaderboard , but knew a birdie on the last would win him the title			1
his approach to the 18th green was magnificent , finishing six feet away , sending ‘ @entity29 ’ wild			2
he holed out for his second of four green jackets			2
9 @entity32 , 1988 needing a birdie to beat @entity34 , @entity32 sent his 1 - iron tee shot into the bunker guarding the left side of the fairway			2
but the @entity40 ’s strike from the sand was so pure that he was able to send his ball into the heart of the green , and watched as it caught that famous downslope and rolled to within eight feet of the pin			2
the birdie putt was never in doubt , and the jig that followed is just as memorable as that remarkable bunker shot			2
@entity32 ( right ) is presented with his green jacket by @entity54 in 1988 8 @entity55 , 2010 you could fill this top 20 entirely with shots from @entity58 if you so wished , but this one probably tops his personal highlights reel			2
having pulled his tee shot on the par - five 13th right and into trees , @entity55 was left with a gap of just a couple of feet through which to thread his ball			0
but ignoring the pleas of his caddie @entity68 to lay up , @entity58 took his six - iron and blasted the ball from off the straw , through the eye of the pines needle , over @entity74 and to five feet of the pin			0
the eagle putt did n’t drop , but the marker was set			0
@entity78 was brilliant that year , but no - one was going to beat @entity55 on this form			0
7 @entity81 , 1957 trailing @entity82 by three strokes after three rounds , @entity81 stood over his approach to the 18th on sunday with a one - shot lead after a brilliant back nine , but fired his 7 - iron into a bunker			0
worse than that , the ball plugged in the sand , leaving @entity82 probably needing a par to force a play - off or birdie to win the title			0
but @entity81 blasted his ball out of the trap and straight into the cup for an incredible birdie			0
it sealed his second major title and only @entity102 win , but his name will now forever be associated with that greenside bunker on 18			1
@entity105 ( left ) leaps into the air after holing his magnificent putt on the 16th green in 1975 6 @entity105 , 1975 as the @entity105 reached his ball on the 16th green , he heard the roars from the 15th as @entity110 holed for a one - stroke lead			1
worse , his ball was over 40 feet from the pin after a poor tee shot			0
a two - putt from that position would have been a good result , but @entity105 had other ideas and stroked the ball round the contours of the green and straight into the cup			1
@entity110 three - putted the same green , @entity105 won by a single shot , and the defeated giant later described @entity105 ’ shot as the best putt he had ever seen			1
click here to watch the shot 5 @entity54 , 1987 @entity4 probably held little hope for this local lad when he entered a play - off with the legendary @entity15 and the @entity129 , @entity130 , for the green jacket in 1987			1
although the @entity132 dropped out after a bogey on the first play - off hole , @entity130 was in pole position after finding the fringe at the 11th , while @entity54 missed the green way to the right			0
but there ’s just something about this hole , and @entity54 sent his 100 - foot chip up onto the green and leapt nearly as high into the air after it hit the flagstick and dropped into the hole			0
@entity130 missed his putt and will forever be remembered as @entity4 ’s bridesmaid			1
4 @entity150 , 1935 who knows what @entity102 might have become without this shot ? at the time it was n’t considered a major and was struggling to gain recognition , but in one stroke @entity150 ’s ‘ shot heard round the world ’ put @entity4 on the map			1
the @entity160 was trailing @entity161 by two on the par - five 15th , but smashed a 235 - yard four wood over water and into the cup for an albatross ( or double eagle , as they like to say over the pond )			0
@entity150 ’s remarkable shot helped him tie @entity161 and go on to beat him in an 18 - hole play - off the next day			0
more importantly , it was the first of many legends born at @entity102			1
3 @entity171 , 2012 having hooked his drive deep into the trees on the 10th , the second hole of his play - off with @entity14 , @entity171 looked dead and buried			1
but @entity171 used all his magical shotmaking skills to spot a gap in the trees and then somehow hook a 160 - yard wedge nearly 90 degrees and onto the putting surface			1
not only that , but his ball stopped 15 feet from the pin and piled the pressure onto @entity14 , who could only bogey			0
tears flowed and ‘ @entity187 ’ @entity171 sealed his place in @entity4 folklore			1
click here to watch the video @entity171 hit a shot no - one thought was possible by hooking his ball round trees onto the 10th green 2 @entity105 , 1986 aged 46 and having not won a major for six years , many thought the @entity105 had lost his teeth , but his back nine at @entity4 was nothing short of the best golf of his career			1
@entity105 covered his final 10 holes in seven under par and made a host of brilliant shots , but none better than his tee shot at 16 , which finished four feet from the cup to set up an easy birdie			1
watch as @entity105 bends down to pick up his tee with the ball in mid-air			1
as everyone around held their breath , he knew from the moment it left the clubface exactly where it was going			0
it does n’t get much cooler than that			0
apart , maybe , from winning a sixth masters , and 18th major title			0
@entity105 ( right ) won a record sixth green jacket with his unforgettable back nine in 1986 1 @entity224 , 2005 it could n’t be anything else , surely ? @entity224 ’ legend was well and truly sealed with this jaw - dropping , gravity - defying chip - in , despite the fact he bogeyed his next two holes and was forced to beat @entity231 in a play - off for his fourth green jacket			1
@entity224 was left in a near - hopeless position down in a hollow after missing the 16th green long , but chipped up onto a slope way left of the hole			2
his ball came to a virtual standstill , before trickling downhill towards the pin , and stopped rolling right on the edge of the cup just long enough to reveal his sponsor ’s logo before dropping in			0
cue bedlam and what will surely go down as the most famous shot in all of golf			0
@entity224 celebrates with his caddie @entity250 after holing his chip from off the 16th green			2
