however , this is in fact the birthplace of the internet - and where the first message was sent from			2
on october 29 , 1969 at 10:30pm , @entity15 and his team sent a message to @entity18 using what we know know as the internet - only to find in crash after two letters			1
the research was spotted by the @entity41 's @entity40 ( @entity40 — later named @entity40 ) , which wanted to use it to distribute academic papers			0
it wanted to test a network , and a contract was awarded to a team of computer engineers at @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , who built the @entity25 , which was similar to the routers still used today			0
the first node was placed at @entity5			2
that two - node transmission marked the birth of the internet - and thankfully it has become a little more reliable since			0
the first message was supposed to be ' log in ' , but their first success also spelled their first failure – the system crashed after the @entity61 were transmitted			1
about an hour later , having recovered from the crash , the @entity63 computer sent a full ' login '			0
the first permanent @entity67 link was then established on november 21 , 1969 , between the @entity25 ( interface message processor ) at @entity5 and the @entity25 at the @entity69			2
by december of 1969 , four nodes were permanently installed at @entity5 , @entity69 , @entity71 , and @entity72 at @entity73			2
by 1975 there were 57 @entity75			0
by 1981 there were 213 , and it has continued to explode inpopularity ever since			0
a detailed view of @entity5 's @entity25 ( @entity25 ) is pictured in a storage closet , where it had been stored for over 20 years , at 3420 @entity82 in @entity5 a detailed view of @entity5 's @entity25 ( @entity25 ) is seen in a storage closet , where it had been stored for over 20 years , at 3420 @entity82 in @entity5 ' how many revolutions can you think about where you can see — within a few feet ! — where it began ? this machine is where the internet breathed to life , spoke its first words , ' @entity15 , the computer scientist for whom the @entity90 is named , told @entity96			1
however , @entity15 admits the machines were almost lost			0
there are currently only two @entity75 still in existence			0
@entity5 's @entity25 was replaced by new technology in 1982 and moved to a staff break room			1
the tiny mention of the project in the @entity18 paper was the only mention of it at the time he also managed to save a @entity63 computer , the refrigerator - sized machine that was used to host that first message			1
the restored room was first opened in 2011 , after being converted to a computer lab for current students , and was restored by the original team - who even matched the paint for photographs			2
' we did n't know what we were doing , ' says @entity15			0
' we did n't even take a photo			0
' the only mention of the world - changing experiment was a small item in the school paper			0
@entity5 's @entity25 ( @entity25 ) is pictured in the birthplace of the @entity26 , at 3420 @entity4 , the original location of the first @entity67 node at @entity5 in @entity127			1
professor @entity15 , distinguished professor of @entity128 at @entity5 is shown next to @entity5 's @entity25 ( @entity25 ) a plaque placed by the @entity130 is pictured at the birthplace of the internet a visitor compares modern - day 3420 @entity4 , the birthplace of the @entity26 , with an archival photograph during the grand opening of the @entity136 at @entity5 in @entity127 , @entity137 october 29 , 2011			1
the first message to pass over the @entity67 was sent from 3420 @entity4 on october 29 , 1969 led by @entity5 professor @entity15 and his team			1
the @entity67 evolved into the internet we use today			0
@entity144 / @entity143 ( united states - tags : @entity145 ) - @entity146 a visitor attends the grand opening of the @entity149 and @entity150 in 3420 @entity82 , the birthplace of the internet at @entity5 in @entity127 , @entity137 october 29 , 2011			1
the first message to pass over the @entity67 was sent from 3420 @entity4 on october 29 , 1969 led by @entity5 professor @entity15 and his team			1
the recreated lab features a replica of the @entity155 computer ( @entity61 ) , a teletype ( c ) similar to one used to communicate with the @entity158 computer , which was connected to @entity5 's @entity25 ( r )			1
the @entity67 evolved into the internet we use today			0
this is the power distribution unit on the @entity25 , taken at the grand re-opening of the original @entity164 lab at @entity5 , the birthplace of the internet			2

room 3420 at @entity5 's @entity4 was where first message was sent
staff communicated with a team at @entity18 - but sent just two letters before system crashed
message was sent using large teletype machine
