@entity1 bosses have launched an official investigation into whether the closure of two @entity4 triggered long waits at nearby hospitals – just days after @entity7 highlighted the problem			1
dr @entity9 , the gp in charge of the huge hospital reorganisation in @entity13 , said he was ordering the inquiry because he was ‘ not happy ’ with @entity16 performance at @entity17 and @entity19 hospitals , following the closure of two other @entity13 units in september			1
the surprise decision comes after repeated denials by @entity1 managers that closing a&es around the country has a ‘ domino effect ’ on other emergency departments			2
@entity1 bosses have launched an official investigation into whether the closure of two @entity4 triggered long waits at nearby hospitals – just days after @entity7 highlighted the problem ( file picture ) the probe will look at whether the controversial closures of @entity4 at @entity36 and @entity37 hospitals caused lengthy delays at nearby casualties – and led to a spike in death rates			1
this paper has discovered numerous instances of @entity16 closures having a knock - on impact elsewhere – leading to longer waits for emergency care , wards bursting at the seams , and more operations being cancelled			1
last sunday , we told how patients at @entity17 and @entity19 have faced the longest @entity16 waits in @entity54 this autumn , following the double closure ten weeks ago			1
since then , a quarter of @entity16 patients at these two hospitals have had to wait more than four hours for treatment			1
that is more than double the comparable figure from the same period last autumn			2
last week a spokesman for @entity63 , which runs @entity17 in @entity64 , and @entity19 hospitals , told us the increase in @entity16 activity there was ‘ certainly not unique ’			1
last sunday , we told how patients at @entity17 ( pictured ) and @entity19 have faced the longest @entity16 waits in @entity54 this autumn , following the double closure ten weeks ago and in september chief executive @entity70 said he did not expect the closures to have a ‘ large impact ’ on @entity17			1
but now dr @entity9 has said an official investigation will look at the issue			1
he said local doctors were ‘ not happy ’ with the recent performance of the @entity4 , adding : ‘ a lot of this is unexplained			1
we need to look at that			0
’ he continued to believe that the increase in patients waiting more than four hours was not due to the closures , but admitted they could have played a part			0
he said : ‘ if we are wrong , we will find out how we got it wrong and not do it again			0
’ waiting so long for treatment was ‘ not good care ’ , he said			2
‘ if your relative was stuck on a trolley for four hours you would be cheesed off			0
’ the investigation will look at death rates at the hospitals , although he thought it would be ‘ hard to say ’ if the closures had affected mortality rates			2
@entity100 , a @entity64 councillor , believed the care of elderly patients had been affected			0
he said : ‘ a month ago i had to go to @entity103 one evening			0
i was there for six hours			0
i met a friend who ’d brought his mother in , in her 90s			0
i went in for a scan at 10am the next day and she was still in casualty – 12 hours later			0
’ the graphic shows the official @entity16 figures for @entity17 and @entity19 before and after closure of @entity36 and @entity37 , with more patients waiting longer @entity115 , @entity116 mp for @entity117 , said : ‘ well done to @entity7			1
i am glad to see some action being taken			0
the investigation needs to be independent and be willing to talk not just to medical experts , but people like councillors and mps who get feedback from patients who use @entity16			1
’ for two years , this paper has highlighted problems hospitals have faced following nearby @entity16 closures – including at @entity130 in @entity131 ; @entity132 in @entity133 , and @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity13			1
people have also been waiting longer for ambulances in @entity138 , @entity139 , which lost its @entity16 in april 2011			1
those in charge of the ‘ reconfiguration exercises ’ , as they call them , argue centralising emergency services in larger hospitals drives up standards			2
they enable the remaining @entity4 to be properly staffed at nights and weekends , they say as @entity150 has a chronic shortage of @entity16 doctors			1
but campaigners claim closures are made to save money , not improve care			0
tens of thousands of patients are resorting to @entity16 for dental treatment because they find dentists too expensive , official figures suggest			2
since 2010 , the number citing cost as the reason they do not go to an @entity1 dentist has risen by 50 per cent , to just under a million			0
at the same time the number receiving treatment at @entity4 in @entity54 for dental problems has leapt fourfold , to 14,500			2
the true number going to @entity16 for dental help is likely to be far higher , because almost half of those who attend casualty receive no actual treatment – only advice			2
tens of thousands of patients are resorting to @entity16 for dental treatment because they find dentists too expensive , official figures suggest ( file picture ) dr @entity182 , president of the @entity183 , said as many as one in 20 visiting a&es at the weekends or bank holidays was now seeking dental help			1
but he cautioned : ‘ we do n’t have any dental equipment or dental skills , so beyond giving them painkillers or antibiotics , there ’s nothing we can do			0
’ @entity1 dental charges have increased 12 per cent since 2010 – roughly in line with inflation			0
the cost of a check - up has risen to £ 18.50 , a filling to £ 50.50 and work such as a crown to £ 219			0
the @entity204 suggested a key factor behind the rise in @entity16 attendances – revealed in figures unearthed by shadow health secretary @entity209 – was the dismantling of @entity211 , which used to employ dental nurses to give advice			2
the @entity214 said most people could afford a dentist			0
a spokesman said dental care was free for all children and a third of adults .			0
