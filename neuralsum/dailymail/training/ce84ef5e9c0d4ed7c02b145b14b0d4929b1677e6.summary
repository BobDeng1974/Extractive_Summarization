@entity1 bosses were accused of a ‘ cop out ’ last night when , hours after attacking the campaign to get @entity4 ! the witch is dead to number one , they decided to play it anyway			1
the corporation confirmed it would play a ‘ brief excerpt ’ of the song during tomorrow ’s chart show , prompting claims the broadcaster is being ‘ manipulated by anarchists ’			2
the decision means that , less than a week after the death of @entity18 , @entity19 ’s greatest peacetime prime minister , the words ‘ the witch is dead ’ may be broadcast on @entity20			1
@entity46 mps branded the decision to play ‘ up to five seconds ’ of the song a ‘ cop out ’ by the new @entity1 director general @entity50 and @entity1 executives			1
@entity4 ! @entity4 reached number three in the official chart yesterday and last night required only 5,000 more sales to take second place			0
it was already number one in the @entity58 chart			2
after hours of private talks , the @entity1 said the radio 1 chart show would contain a ‘ news item ’ explaining why the song was in the charts and that a short clip of the song would be played			1
facing the first crisis of his leadership , @entity50 issued a statement saying he did not believe the song should be banned			1
he said : ‘ i understand the concerns about this campaign			0
i personally believe it is distasteful and inappropriate			0
the @entity1 will nplay the 1939 tune during @entity20 's top 40 countdown , hosted by @entity75 , left			1
it is still some distance behind the week ’s biggest selling single , @entity78 ( 100 % ) by @entity79 , right , ft a * m * e place in the charts : the song is the shortest top 10 single ever , with the most popular version running to 51 seconds ‘ however i do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity			1
’ @entity50 held a series of conversations with radio 1 controller @entity93 and director of radio @entity95 about how to deal with the growing storm			1
but mr @entity93 told @entity98 ’s @entity100 programme that it had been his decision to air the clip , not @entity50 ’s			2
the power of a @entity34 campaign should not be underestimated			0
in 2009 a @entity34 campaign was designed to prevent another @entity107 number one			0
as a consequence rock band @entity108 won the most competitive battle in years for the @entity111 number one			0
the band 's single , @entity112 , sold 500,000 downloads beating @entity107 winner @entity116 's the climb by 50,000 copies to clinch the top spot			2
in a blog posted on the @entity1 ’s website , mr @entity93 wrote : ‘ i find the campaign to promote the song in response to the death of @entity18 as distasteful as anyone			1
’ he acknowledged there was ‘ understandable anger ’ from people who were ‘ appalled by this campaign ’			0
but he said the chart show could not ‘ ignore a high new entry which clearly reflects the views of a big enough portion of the record - buying public to propel it up the charts ’			2
mr @entity93 added : ‘ to ban the record from our airwaves completely would risk giving the campaign the oxygen of further publicity and might inflame an already delicate situation			2
’ the @entity1 would not confirm exactly what part of the song would be aired tomorrow , but most of the lyrics contain the offensive phrase			2
mr @entity93 said the station was ‘ still making a decision ’ on whether to include the actual words in the clip it chooses			0
but the @entity1 ’s explanation did not satisfy many @entity46 mps			0
@entity156 former defence minister sir @entity155 told the @entity157 : ‘ a lot of people will feel this decision is a cop - out			0
the @entity1 used to have a charter requiring it to observe taste and decency			0
the director general himself has said this song is tasteless			1
do they not now believe in taste and decency ? ‘ it is utterly disrespectful to play this song when @entity18 put her life on the line for her country and came within inches of death at @entity177 in 1984			1
‘ playing this song , even a part of it , will play into the hands of the politically - inspired campaign by trots and the @entity183 who have never forgiven @entity18 for destroying socialism			1
’ new director general @entity50 defended playing the clip , saying : ' i do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle and a ban would only give it more publicity ' @entity46 mp @entity194 added : ‘ we have broadcasting rules which prevent the playing of songs which project hatred			1
‘ this song is being used to project hatred at a time of national mourning – it ’s the same thing			0
’ @entity204 , a @entity46 member of the @entity206 select committee , had argued for the whole song to be played			0
but he contrasted the ‘ typical @entity1 fudge ’ with @entity18 ’s leadership style			1
‘ it ’s definitely true that @entity18 would never have fudged a decision in the way the @entity1 has , which is probably why she did n’t have a great deal of time for the @entity1			1
’ @entity46 mp @entity215 said : ‘ i am surprised they are prepared to be manipulated so readily by the agenda of anarchists and the hard left			0
’ but even before the decision on the chart show was reached yesterday , @entity220 had already broadcast a 15 - second clip of the song during a discussion on the @entity226 , presented by @entity227			0
a spokesman for @entity220 said : ‘ in order to fully illustrate the subject for listeners a short clip of the song was played as part of a reasoned debate around the topic			0
’ but former radio 1 dj @entity237 , an admirer of @entity18 , said the @entity1 should play the song – because the former prime minister was ‘ tough enough ’ not to have cared			1
@entity242 media campaigner backing the song 's rise up the charts defends his project			2

@entity248 has now sold *20,000* copies since @entity18 's death on *monday*
it has been pushed up the charts *due* to an *internet* campaign
@entity1 confirms it will play it on @entity20 this *sunday* - but a shorter version
director general @entity50 : ' i do believe it would be wrong to ban the song outright as free speech is an important principle '
the track , which costs *79p* online , is currently @entity269 on @entity58
