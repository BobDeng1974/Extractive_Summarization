it could be the most hi - tech road trip ever attempted			0
@entity1 is set to attempt what it bills as the ' longest automated drive ever attempted in @entity4 ' the 3,500 - mile coast - to - coast excursion will take place in a specially rigged @entity8 that will mostly drive itself			1
the @entity1 drive will kick off march 22 near @entity13 's @entity12 , with plans to wind up in @entity15 just before the annual auto show opens there on april 3			1
during the coast - to - coast journey in the @entity8 , at least two @entity1 engineers will be aboard , including one behind the wheel			1
@entity1 , one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems , is using the long journey in the @entity8 crossover to acquire real - world data from a sophisticated array of cameras , radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology - as well as wireless connected - vehicle technology			1
the firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems , which are being developed with such suppliers as @entity36 , an @entity38 maker of computer vision and collision avoidance systems , and software provider @entity41 , a spinout from @entity44 's self - driving car program			2
@entity1 's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self - driving cars , some of which could be production - ready by 2020			2
the @entity1 drive will kick off march 22 near @entity13 's @entity12 , with plans to wind up in @entity15 just before the annual auto show opens there on april 3			1
@entity53 , @entity1 's chief technology officer , sees the automated driver assistance systems in the @entity8 as building blocks on the road to fully self - driving cars in the next decade			1
during the coast - to - coast journey in the @entity8 , at least two @entity1 engineers will be aboard , including one behind the wheel			1
@entity1 , a former @entity58 unit domiciled in the @entity59 , will test such functions as traffic jam assist , automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet			0
all of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years			0
although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years , @entity68 said , ' our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time ' in case of emergency situations that self - driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle			0

fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $ 5,000 to the cost of a car , estimates @entity87 , vice president of advanced and product engineering for @entity1 's electronics and safety division			2
@entity1 is providing some of the components and technology , including vehicle - to - vehicle connectivity , for @entity58 's @entity95 automated driving system , which will debut in 2016 on the new @entity97 sedan			2
during the cross-country trek , the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. ' @entity1 had great success testing its car in @entity109 and on the streets of @entity111 , ' said @entity68			0
' now it 's time to put our vehicle to the ultimate test by broadening the range of driving conditions			0
' this drive will help us collect invaluable data in our quest to deliver the best automotive grade technologies on the market			0

drive will start march 22 near @entity13 's @entity12
plans to wind up in @entity15 before the auto show opens on april 3
drive will use a specially *adapted* @entity8
