expat pensioners living in the hottest parts of @entity3 like the @entity4 are finally going to lose taxpayer - funded help with their heating bills , it can be revealed			1
@entity7 is spending £ 22million - a - year on winter fuel allowances for people living elsewhere in @entity3 , despite more than a third living in sunnier climes			2
work and pensions secretary @entity12 today condemns the ' absurd ' handouts and vows to change the rules which have cost the @entity7 taxpayer £ 130million in a decade			1
people living in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 will lose out , but the taxpayer still faces a bill for pensioners in 25 countries including @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
official guidance says it is supposed ' to help pay your heating bills ' and is designed as a flat sum for all pensioners to put towards the costs of keeping warm during the icy winter months			1
but @entity44 rules mean it can be paid to expats if they can show they have a ' genuine link with the @entity7 ' , and the money does not necessarily have to be spent on energy bills			2
as a result thousands of people living in warm @entity3 countries are able to receive the money , and spend it how they like			1
in 2002 - 03 , just 8,000 people in 16 countries claimed at a total cost of £ 1million			0
but huge growth in take - up and @entity44 expansion means that in 2013 - 14 a total of 135,285 people in 30 countries received £ 133million			0
it includes 50,000 people in @entity17 , 30,000 in @entity23 , 3,300 in @entity20 , 8,000 in @entity19 and 2,000 in @entity18			1
now ministers plan to introduce a new ' temperature test ' to stop payments being made to countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the @entity7 – the @entity70 at @entity71 ( 42f )			0
people in @entity20 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity23 , @entity21 and @entity19 will all lose the right to claim from september 2015			1
the @entity74 today confirmed pensioners in @entity22 will also miss out			0
but the handouts will still be available to people in 25 countries : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity28 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity29 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity27 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
the cost of paying winter fuel allowances to pensioners living outside the @entity7 has rocketed from £ 1million in 2002 - 03 to £ 133million in 2013 - 14 , official figures show if the rules had been in place last winter it would have cut the bill from £ 23million to just £ 7million			1
mr @entity12 told @entity108 : ' winter fuel payments exist to help @entity7 's pensioners keep themselves warm			2
' it 's absurd and offensive that taxpayers are funding these payments for people who have retired to the @entity116 and enjoy warmer weather			2
' legislation to introduce the temperature test has now been laid in @entity120 and will come into force for next winter , 2015 - 16			0
mr @entity12 added : ' the @entity44 has frustrated our attempts to address this issue in the past , but with our new temperature - based eligibility criteria we 're able to satisfy @entity44 rules as well as prevent this obscene waste of taxpayers ' money			2
' work and pensions secretary @entity12 said the new temperature test would ' prevent this obscene waste of taxpayers ' money ' the average temperature in @entity17 in december and january is @entity134 , almost double the average in the @entity70			1
@entity136 vowed at the last election to protect the winter fuel allowance from cuts , despite complaints that the payments were not needed by wealthy pensioners			0
however , both the @entity143 and @entity144 have said it is wrong to pay the money to rich pensioners who do not need it			0
labour leader @entity149 used a speech earlier this month to set out his plan for ' common sense spending reductions , not slash and burn '			0
he said : ' we have already set out ways in which we can save money [ including ] an end to the winter fuel allowance for the wealthiest pensioners			0
' @entity143 deputy pm @entity159 has also warned the system is unfair			0
he said last year : ' the fact that we 're asking people on low incomes to pay through their taxes to basically pay the fuel bills of people who do n't need to heat their homes because they live in sunny parts of @entity3 and maybe did n't even work here before they retired , i think that lifts the lid on a wider problem in our welfare system			0

*exclusive* : new rules *curbing* handouts to start from september
pensioners living in @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity23 will lose cash
but people in 25 countries will still be eligible for help with heating bills
@entity12 condemns ' absurd and offensive ' use of *public* money
