by @entity1 reporter published : 10:26 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 14:05 est , 30 september 2013 @entity2 has a new law scaling back the period for early voting and imposing stringent voter identification requirements			1
it is among at least five @entity9 states adopting stricter voter id and other election laws			1
the @entity12 on aug. 22 sued @entity13 over the state 's voter id law and is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit over redistricting laws in @entity13 that minority groups consider to be discriminatory			1
@entity20 lawmakers in southern states insist the new measures are needed to prevent voter fraud , though such crimes are infrequent			2
democrats and civil rights groups argue the tough new laws are intended to make voting more difficult for minorities and students , voting groups that lean toward @entity25 , in states with legacies of poll taxes and literacy tests			0
attorney general @entity35 holds a news conference at the @entity12 in @entity37 , thursday , sept. 26 , 2013 attorney general @entity35 is expected to announce the lawsuit against @entity2 at a news conference monday , according to a person who has been briefed on the department 's plans but is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke only on condition of anonymity			2
@entity35 will be joined at the news conference by the acting assistant attorney general for the @entity12 's civil rights division , @entity50 , and the three @entity52 attorneys from @entity2 , the person said			2
in the @entity2 lawsuit , the person said , the government will challenge requirements in state law that eliminate the first seven days of early voting opportunities and eliminate same - day voter registration during the early voting period			1
same - day registration allows voters to cast a ballot immediately after presenting elections officials with proof of their name and home address			0
the @entity12 challenge also is aimed at a provision eliminating the counting of certain types of provisional ballots by voters who cast ballots in their home counties but do not vote in the correct precincts			0
newly emboldened by a @entity77 decision that struck down the heart of the @entity79 , a growing number of @entity20 - led states are moving aggressively to tighten voting rules finally , the federal government will challenge a provision in the new law that requires voters to present government - issued identification at the polls in order to cast ballots			1
in @entity2 , a recent state board of elections survey found that hundreds of thousands of registered voters did not have a state - issued @entity92			0
many of those voters are young , black , poor or elderly			0
in remarks sept. 20 to the @entity95 , @entity35 said the @entity12 will not allow the @entity77 's action to be interpreted as ' open season ' for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights			1
the @entity12 will ask a federal judge to place the four provisions in @entity2 's new law under federal scrutiny for an indeterminate period â€” a process known as pre-clearance			1
however , the provision of the @entity79 that the @entity12 is invoking may be a difficult tool for the @entity110 administration to use			1
a handful of jurisdictions have been subjected to pre-clearance , or advance approval , of election changes through the @entity117 provision it is relying on , but a court first must find that a state or local government engaged in intentional discrimination under the @entity124 's 14th or 15th amendments , or the jurisdiction has to admit to discrimination			0
unlike other parts of the voting law , the discriminatory effect of an action is not enough to trigger court review			0
nowhere is the debate over voting rights is more heated than in @entity134 , where the chaotic recount in the disputed 2000 presidential race took place			0
@entity134 election officials are set to resume an effort to remove noncitizens from the state 's voting rolls			2
a purge last year ended in embarrassment after hundreds of @entity52 citizens , most of whom were black or @entity148 , were asked to prove their citizenship or risk losing their right to vote .			0
