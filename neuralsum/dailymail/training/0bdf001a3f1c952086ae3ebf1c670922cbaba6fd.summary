@entity0 could have been undone by the type of rapid climate change that many of today ’s policymakers fear			1
this is according to tree ring samples found in an ancient @entity8 coffin which reveal the civilisation came to its knees following changes to its food resources and infrastructure			0
the find adds to the debate about what led to the collapse of the civilisation more than 3,000 years ago , with theories ranging from wars to famine and disease			0
@entity0 could have been undone by the type of rapid climate change that many of today ’s policymakers fear			2
this is according to tree ring samples found in an ancient @entity8 coffin ( pictured ) which reveal this ancient world came to its knees following changes to its food resources the latest study looked at samples taken from the @entity30 - ha - ishutef @entity8 coffin alongside wood from funeral boats buried near the pyramid of @entity34 ‘ the tree rings show the kind of rapid climate change that we and policymakers fear , ’ said professor @entity35 from @entity36			1
‘ this record shows that climate change does n’t have to be as catastrophic as an @entity42 to wreak havoc '			1
researchers at @entity36 in @entity45 used a technique called ‘ dendro radiocarbon wiggle matching , ’ to precisely date the items – plus or minus around 10 years			1
the coffin of @entity30 - ha - ishutef showing details of the decorations on the walls			0
this is the coffin from which the tree ring samples were taken			0
the samples showed a small , unusual anomaly following the year 2200 b.c. @entity58 research has suggested a major short - term arid event about this time from the building of vast pyramids to religious life and burial practices , life in ancient @entity0 was very different to our own			1
but modern vegetarians may have more in common than they thought with the ancient @entity8 , because it is thought that they also ate a diet composed largely of vegetables , fruit , wheat and barley			0
archaeologists have thought for a while that most settled ancient populations survived on a vegetarian diet and now carbon isotope analysis has given experts a better idea than ever before of what the ancient @entity8 ate			0
a team of researchers from the @entity83 studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies of people that lived in @entity0 between @entity88 and @entity89			0
they found that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period			0
the finding also echoes many paintings in @entity8 tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat to make loaves of bread , which are often offered to god of the afterlife , @entity105			0
the technique calibrates radiocarbon isotopes found in the sample tree rings with patterns known from other places in the world that have already identified chronologies			2
the samples showed a small , unusual anomaly following the year 2200 b.c. @entity58 research has suggested a possible short - term drought event about this time			1
‘ this radiocarbon anomaly would be explained by a change in growing season , that is , climate , dating to exactly this arid period of time , ’ said professor @entity35 from			1
‘ we ’re showing that radiocarbon and these archaeological objects can confirm and in some ways better date a key climate episode			2
’ that climate episode , said professor @entity35 , had major political implications			1
there was just enough change in the climate to upset food resources and other infrastructure , which is likely what led to the collapse of the @entity137 and affected the @entity138 and a number of other civilisations			2
‘ we ’re in exactly the same situation as the @entity137 : if something suddenly undid the standard food production model in large areas of the @entity147 it would be a disaster , ’ he said			2
tree rings from the coffin were analysed alongside wooden boats buried near the pyramid of @entity34 climate change , said professor @entity35 , had major political implications			1

rings were dated with boats buried near @entity34 pyramid
technique called ‘ dendro radiocarbon wiggle matching ’ used to date items
@entity169 showed a small , unusual anomaly following the year 2200 *bc*
climate research has suggested a major drought event about this time
