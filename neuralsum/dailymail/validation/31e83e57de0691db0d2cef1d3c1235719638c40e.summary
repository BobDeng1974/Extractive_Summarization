it seemed like a great idea at the time			0
but when actor @entity3 took to @entity4 for a @entity5 # @entity6 last night , polite questions were the last thing on fans ' minds			1
instead , the 31 - year - old @entity11 actor was deluged with queries that ranged from the bizarre to the thoroughly indecent			1
marriage proposals also proved popular with @entity15 fans taking part in the @entity17 , which took place immediately after the fourth episode of the drama aired , as did requests for an uptick in shirtless scenes			2
' how do you ever stop looking in the mirror ? ' asked a @entity4 user called @entity39			1
' like most women ( and quite a few men ) i cant think of anything sensible to # @entity30 once @entity3 takes his shirt off			2
sorry , ' wrote one hyperventilating fan			0
another , named @entity47 , asked : ' # @entity30 why was i never offered the position of painting semi nude actors when i had my careers talk at school ? ! ' @entity3 , although slow to respond to marriage proposals , gamely attempted to answer many of the more sensible questions offered up by fans , including one about his new - found fame			1
swooning : a fan named @entity59 spoke for many when she shared her appreciation of shirtless scenes compliments : many of the questions offered up by fans focused on @entity3 's looks nice work ! another wished that her careers ' advice had included tips on becoming a make - up artist asked whether he knew that a @entity4 account dedicated to his hair existed , the @entity75 answered : ' i am aware , yeah ! it â€™s pretty hilarious ! ' not everyone was happy with his answers , however , with one fan complaining that @entity3 took longer to answer than his character did to find copper - a reference to the ongoing plot line about @entity15 's mining activities			1
' did he answer any of the questions or has he been removed to some sort of high security location for his own protection ? # @entity30 ' , wrote another fan named @entity93 afterwards			0
most , however , contented themselves with firing questions on everything from gardening to the pedestrianisation of @entity98 at the actor			0
gardening : another popular topic with fans was gardening - in particular the scything of lawns left field : others offered up some more unusual questions about the election and @entity98 city centre too slow : others complained about the actor 's slowness to answer questions among the more amusing was a question from a @entity4 user named @entity115 who asked the actor whether he might be interested in a spot of gardening			1
' my mower has packed up , ' she wrote			0
' would you come round and scythe my lawn please ? # @entity30 ' another , @entity126 , offered up a tongue - in - cheek query that read : ' @entity30 thinking of ditching the wife , running off with a red - haired wench and opening a copper mine			0
any tips or pilchard recipes ? ' most entertaining of all was a fan who quizzed @entity3 on his plans for life @entity136			2
' would you consider presenting @entity139 ? ' asked @entity140			0
@entity3 chose not to answer that one			0
pin up : another asked how @entity3 's new - found pin - up status was working out for him @entity145 's replacement ? one hopeful fan asked @entity3 to consider a presenting career popular : the @entity149 drama has proved one of the @entity5 's most successful dramas of 2015 so far			1

@entity3 took to @entity4 last night for a @entity5 q&a with fans
but things took a turn for the racy with @entity3 deluged with proposals
others asked him to come to their homes to scythe their lawns
@entity3 , 31 , did respond to some of the more sensible questions
