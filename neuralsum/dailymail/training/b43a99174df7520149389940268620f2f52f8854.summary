by @entity0 and @entity1 with his @entity3 moustache and dishevelled wartime appearance , he may look like any other prisoner of war			2
@entity7 's story , however , is much more remarkable , as the @entity9 flight lieutenant was the real prisoner upon which @entity11 's character is based in @entity13			1
while the iconic scene from the 1963 film shows @entity11 's @entity17 attempting to cross the @entity19 border on a motorbike , the reality saw @entity9 officer bull imprisoned by the @entity22 and murdered on @entity24 's orders			1
great escapee : in a picture taken by @entity27 , @entity7 , the @entity9 flight lieutenant on which @entity11 's character was based , is photographed 24 hours before his death in the @entity33 war film @entity13 , @entity11 's character attempts to jump a barbed wire fence at the @entity19 border before his capture and return to a @entity37 pow camp in @entity38			1
the details for the film 's inspiration emerged yesterday as a memorial for flight lieutenant @entity43 and the three fellow escapers who were killed alongside him was unveiled in the @entity48 town of most			1
unpublished images have since been found by an historian of @entity51 , along with his other three failed escapees squadron leader @entity53 , @entity55 flight officer @entity54 and @entity57 flight lieutenant @entity56			1
movie interpretation : the @entity11 filmed showed his character attempt to escape the camp on a motorbike , though this was added for artistic license inspiration : just like in the 1963 film ( pictured ) lt @entity43 and fellow escapees pulled on a rope outside the camp to alert other pows about the nearby patrolling guard in the pictures taken shortly after their capture , the four men all stare defiantly at the camera			1
just 24 hours later they had all been executed			2
their plight does have a certain resemblance with the events of the @entity13 , however			2
research has shown that , just like in the @entity33 film , @entity43 sneaks out of the tunnel near the @entity13 , trailing a rope so he can signal to men behind him when the patrolling guard is at a safe distance			2
@entity86 , an historian writing a book about the @entity13 , found the pictures in a war crimes file at the @entity90 at @entity91			0
executed : @entity57 flight lieutenant @entity56 , squadron leader @entity92 , and @entity55 flight officer @entity54 were also captured and killed along with bull by the @entity22 memorial : the details for the film 's inspiration emerged yesterday as a memorial for flight lieutenant @entity43 and the three fellow escapers who were killed alongside him was unveiled in the @entity48 town of most he said : ' the photos show them as terrified men			1
' within 24 hours of these photos being taken they were lying with bullet holes in their heads			0
' sombre : soldiers flank a memorial gravestone @entity111 airmen including @entity43 executed in cold blood after ' @entity13 ' breakout will be honoured on saturday at the place in @entity115			0
a @entity48 @entity116 fly past is to mark the unveiling of a permanent memorial in the northern @entity121 city of most on the 68th anniversary of the daring escape by @entity55 men			0
relatives of these four men will then follow in their footsteps , retracing their famous escape from @entity13 to the @entity130 border , where they were intercepted and then secretly murdered on @entity24 's orders			0
the memorial — which brings the four men ’s families together for the first time — is the initiative of a @entity48 commercial pilot , @entity137 , who says the men should have been recognized ' many years ago			0
' ' this was deliberate , calculated murder , not death on a battlefield in war , ' he said			0
after the war , tribunals in @entity146 and @entity147 sentenced 20 former @entity22 officers to death for the murders and jailed many more			1
however , no one was ever located or brought to justice for the execution of the four pilots near @entity115 .			0
