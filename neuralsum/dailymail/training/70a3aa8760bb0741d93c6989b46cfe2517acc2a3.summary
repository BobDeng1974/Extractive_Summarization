by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 07:08 est , 18 july 2013 valued : @entity1 , the maritime time - keeping device , used by captain @entity3 on board the bounty dragged from his cabin , bewildered and wearing only a nightdress , captain @entity3 of the @entity5 was facing a nightmarish scenario			1
half of his ship 's crew , emboldened by the rallying cries of traitorous first mate @entity14 , were in mutiny			1
about to be cast off by his own men , his thoughts must have been panicked - stranded more than 1,300 west of @entity22 , his prospects of survival appeared bleak			0
and yet , in the midst of one of the most notorious incidents in @entity27 naval history , @entity3 did not plead for his life			0
instead , he demanded the mutineers hand over the ship 's chronometer			1
alongside his clerk @entity32 , @entity3 pleaded with the mutineers to let him take @entity1 , a timekeeping device that allowed the crew to determine their longitude			1
documents held by the @entity38 reveal for the first time how @entity3 interrupted the chaotic mutiny in 1789 to try and save the valued timepiece			2
in his account of events he wrote : ' mr @entity32 attempted to save the time - keeper but he was hurried away by the mutineers with : " damn your eyes : you are well off to get what you have "			0
' why was @entity3 , facing such unprecedented catastrophe , so desperate to leave with the chronometer ? admission : captain @entity3 's letter to the @entity54 explaining that the chronometer was ' pirated from my command ' @entity58 : an illustration of the 1789 @entity60 when half captain 's @entity3 's crew rose up against him and cast him off the ship was it a symbolic gesture , did he simply wish to cling on to something which helped maintain a sense of order ? the answer may in fact have been much less romantic			1
the chronometer was worth a serious amount of money			0
@entity3 had made a promise to the @entity54 that he would look after @entity1 which had cost £ 200 ( around £ 11,000 in today 's money )			1
at loggerheads : @entity3 , left , was dragged from his cabin in the middle of the night by first mate @entity14 , right , and his band of mutineers he wrote to the @entity82 on october 18 , 1787 , acknowledging receipt of the device ' which i promise to return to ( the maker ) on their order or demand			2
' and @entity1 's value was more than just monetary , in 18th century seafaring it was a key tool of survival			2
@entity99 up with @entity3 's floggings and hungry to return to the kind of idyllic life they had enjoyed in @entity22 , @entity97 and his mutineers lowered the deposed captain and his loyalists into a rowing boat and left them for dead			1
they then used @entity1 to navigate their way to @entity106 which they believed would be the perfect place to hide out			1
@entity109 , professor of history at @entity38 , told @entity111 that the watch enabled the crew to work out that @entity106 was inaccurately marked on the @entity54 's maps			1
they then set fire to the @entity5 to cover their tracks			0
land ahoy : after having been cast adrift , @entity3 and his crew were hospitably received by the governor of @entity121 meanwhile , despite having lost the crucial piece of technology , @entity3 was able to complete a remarkable 47 - day voyage to @entity121 in the @entity125			1
on october 27 , 1790 , he wrote to the @entity54 admitting that @entity1 was no longer in his possession			2
' i am to inform you the the @entity129 , which was given to my charge on board @entity132 , was left in the said ship when pirate from my command on the 28th april , 1789			0
' the crimes of the mutineers caught up with them two years later when , after news reached @entity27 , a ship was dispatched to arrest them			0
after rounding up 14 out of 23 of the mutineers , they were imprisoned in a makeshift cell on the deck of @entity147			0
@entity148 died along with 31 crewmen when the ship ran aground on the @entity150 , but the remaining ten prisoners were returned to @entity27 to face court martial in @entity153			0
@entity1 's journey of high drama was far from over			2
it remained on @entity106 with the mutineers until 1808 when it was bought by an @entity159 whaler named @entity160 who bought it and travelled on to @entity163 , @entity164			2
when @entity160 ended up in prison the chronometer was confiscated by the governor before it passed through the hands of a @entity170 mule trader and a @entity172 captain			0
eventually it ended up with the @entity174 which allowed it to return to the @entity175 in the 1960s where it remains today .			0

captain @entity3 was kicked off the @entity60 by mutinous crew in 1789
during revolt , he pleaded to keep hold of @entity1 , the ship 's chronometer
but mutineers *refused* to hand it over and used it to flee to @entity106
new letter reveals how @entity3 had to admit to the @entity54 it had been lost
