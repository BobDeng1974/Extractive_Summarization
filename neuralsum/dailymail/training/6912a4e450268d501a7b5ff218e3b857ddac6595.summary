the car shuffled to a halt as the flames , somewhat reduced after the initial explosion , continued to burn			0
with the race temporarily suspended , the video shows a tense moment where it is unclear whether the car will go up again or the worst of the flames is over			2
bystanders can be seen coughing as the flaming car flies by with a cloud of smoke in its wake			0
as the explosion occurred , pieces of the car went flying , narrowly missing spectators at a track in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31			0
despite the dramatic scene , nobody was injured			0
