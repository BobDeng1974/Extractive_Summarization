police and security services have thwarted 40 terrorists plots in @entity4 since the july 7 attacks nine years ago , @entity0 revealed today			1
the foiled atrocities including ' marauding ' ' @entity9 - style ' gun attacks streets , an attempt to blow up the @entity11 and airplanes , and murder troops and a @entity4 ambassador			1
unveiling a raft of new counter-terror measures , the home secretary warned the threat to @entity4 is ' greater than it ever has been ' and stressed the terrorists ' only have to be lucky once '			1
mrs may said it would help to prevent radicalisation , strengthen the @entity34 regime for controlling the movements of terror suspects and give greater powers to ' disrupt and control the movements of people who go abroad to fight '			1
@entity4 companies will be banned from funding ransom payments and it will be made easier to track extremists on the internet			1
mrs may stressed the new laws are not a ' knee - jerk response to a sudden perceived threat '			2
instead she stressed that since taking office she has been briefed on hundreds of terror suspects ' intent on attacking @entity4 , the @entity4 people and our interests overseas '			1
the @entity53 believe that since the 7/7 attacks in 2005 â€“ in which 52 people were killed by four bombers on @entity58 - around 40 terrorist plots have been disrupted , she said			2
mrs may added : ' there have been attempts to conduct marauding ' @entity9 - style ' gun attacks on our streets , blow up the @entity11 , bring down airliners , assassinate a @entity4 ambassador and murder serving members of our armed forces			1
' almost all of these attacks have been prevented by the first - class men and women of our security and intelligence services , the police , and our allies overseas			2
' but as the @entity80 once boasted , the terrorists ' only have to be lucky once			2
' in a speech to @entity83 in central @entity84 , mrs may announced the new counter-terrorism and @entity28 will be rushed in the @entity30 on wednesday key measures announced by home secretary @entity0 include : last year , drummer @entity87 was murdered in broad daylight by @entity90 extremists in @entity84 , while @entity91 , an 82 - year old @entity92 from @entity93 , was murdered by a @entity95 far right extremist who then tried to bomb mosques in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , mrs may added			1
' the terrorists who committed these cowardly acts are now where they belong , behind bars serving life sentences			0
' but since the attacks they carried out , the threat we face from terrorism has grown more serious			1
' yesterday , @entity113 commissioner sir @entity112 disclosed that ' four or five ' plots have been foiled this year			0
up and down the country , officers will be briefing more than 6,000 people at 80 venues including schools , universities , airports , shopping centres , cinemas and farms in a bid to engage the public and businesses in preventing attacks			2
the terror threat level in the @entity4 was raised from substantial to severe a few months ago against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring @entity4 jihadis travelling to @entity133 and @entity134 to learn terrorist ' tradecraft '			1
since april 2010 , 753 people have been arrested for terrorism - related offences , 212 have been charged and 148 have been successfully prosecuted , she said			0
a total of 138 people are behind bars serving sentences for terrorism - related offences , mrs may added , while 13 people , including hook - handed radical cleric @entity145 , have been extradited			0
the @entity147 has removed 65,000 items from the internet that ' encouraged or glorified acts of terrorism ' , the home secretary said			1
since the july 7 attacks in 2005 , around 40 terror plots have been disrupted , mrs may revealed @entity155 gunman @entity154 brought terror to @entity9 in 2008 as part of a group of almost 30 attackers which rampaged through the streets of @entity162 's financial capital for three days , killing 166 people @entity113 's assistant commissioner @entity164 warned the terror threat will last for years the extremist threat to @entity4 will continue even if the violence in @entity134 and @entity133 subsides , according to a senior police chief			1
@entity113 's assistant commissioner @entity164 stressed that the terror threat comes from many parts of the world			1
asked if the current terror climate would continue for at least five years , mr @entity164 said : ' we have seen a step change that will sustain for many years			2
' even if the awfulness that 's happening in @entity134 and @entity133 was miraculously to get sorted in the next year or so - and that looks a very optimistic ' if ' - there are other countries across parts of @entity180 and elsewhere in the world which are in parlous states and the potential for this type of terrorism to reach back into @entity186 to continue in other theatres is equally great			0
' whether it continues in that theatre or whether it moves into other places i think there 's a high prospect of it continuing in this nature for several years			0
' mrs may conceded that it is not possible to ' entirely eliminate the threat from terrorism ' , but it was necessary to act to ' reduce the risk presented by our enemies '			2
she went on : ' we are engaged in a struggle that is fought on many fronts and in many forms			0
it is a struggle that will go on for many years			0
' and the threat we face right now is perhaps greater than it ever has been and we must have the powers we need to defend ourselves			1
' under the new laws , schools , prisons and councils are to be required by law to put in place measures to stop would - be extremists from being drawn into terrorism			0
a statutory duty will be placed on named organisations - such as colleges , universities , the police and probation providers - to help deter radicalisation and , where organisations fail , ministers will be able to issue court - enforced directions to them			0
over the weekend it emerged that police are to be handed powers in the new bill to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists and paedophiles			1
the @entity236 will oblige internet service providers ( @entity238 ) to retain information linking @entity240 ( ip ) addresses to individual users			0
@entity243 , director of human rights group @entity244 , said : ' yet again politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism			0
' so youngsters will have their passports seized at borders and others will be prevented coming home			2
' even our universities must read from ministers ' scripts on radicalisation			0
another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote			0
' labour leader @entity266 said his party would work with the government to ensure the security services and police had the necessary powers			2
speaking on a visit to the @entity274 construction site in central @entity84 , mr @entity266 said : ' we share the government 's desire and ambition to make sure we keep people safe and deal with people returning from @entity134 or going to @entity134			0
' that 's why we are going to be scrutinising @entity0 's proposals			1
we want to work with the government and we will be looking closely at them			0
' he added : ' i think we should always be looking at what more needs to be done to protect the security of our citizens			0
' we have said , for example , in relation to @entity34 - the control order the government has put in place - that we should have a relocation power because that was important , that was part of the previous control order regime			1
' we want to do everything we can to keep our citizens safe			0
