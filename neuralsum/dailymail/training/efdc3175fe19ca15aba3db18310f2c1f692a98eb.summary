by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 08:11 est , 20 january 2014 the family of @entity3 allege that dropping the @entity5 man at a @entity6 was part of a ' perverse joke ' about his heritage the family of a drunk @entity5 father who was run over and killed after police dropped him off at a @entity6 instead of arresting him are suing the force for racial discrimination			1
@entity15 , 22 , was hit and killed while walking along a four - lane highway on june 28 2012 near @entity17 , shortly after @entity19 state police found him sitting in his truck while clearly intoxicated			1
but instead of arresting him , the officers took him five miles away to the nearest @entity6 before leaving him there , an act which the family claims is part of a ' perverse joke ' about his heritage			1
the family has now launched legal action for unspecified damages against the @entity32 in @entity19 , several of the agency 's deputies and an officer with the @entity36			2
according to @entity39 , the complaint reads : ' violating all of their own rules of conduct and safety , defendants ridiculed mr. @entity43 as a @entity5 , ultimately leaving him disoriented and intoxicated in a dangerous area where he was predictably killed by a passing motorist			0
' the defendants mocked and ridiculed mr. @entity43 based on his @entity48 or @entity5 national origin			0
defendant trooper @entity49 failed to stop the discriminatory behavior of the deputies			0
' @entity52 then advised defendant trooper @entity49 that they were going to transport mr. @entity43 to a nearby @entity6			1
' police said at the time that they dropped @entity56 off at the @entity6 expecting him to call for a ride			1
however the lawsuit alleges the officers received numerous calls about him from the store manager and drivers along the highway during the 50 - minute period after they dropped him off , and failed to take proper action @entity56 was hit and killed near to @entity67 on @entity68 36 ( pictured )			1
his wife , two children and parents are now suing the police for racial discrimination @entity43 , who was working in the @entity68 at the time and sending money back to his wife , two children and parents in @entity5 , was hit on @entity68 36 just north of @entity17 , @entity19 , and died of severe head , neck and chest injuries			1
an attorney for the patrolman said the discrimination allegations are ludicrous and that the officers gave @entity86 ' a major break ' by letting him go , especially considering that his legal status in the country was in question			2
@entity91 , the attorney representing the @entity19 state patrolman named in the lawsuit , said that @entity43 's death was a tragedy but that authorities were not discriminating against him			0
' there 's no discrimination here , ' he said			2
' if you ask me , it could just as easily be said that deputies were giving him a major break by not taking him to jail , maybe in order to not have discriminatory actions taken against him , vis - a - vis deportation			0
' as an observer trying to be independent , i would suggest that 's way more plausible than that they were discriminating against him because he 's @entity48			0
' two deputies , @entity115 and @entity116 , were fired over the matter			0
patrolman @entity49 also was fired but won an appeal of that decision and was reinstated .			0
