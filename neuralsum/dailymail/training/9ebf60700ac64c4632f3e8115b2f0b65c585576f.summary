by @entity0 we learn lots of bad habits from celebrities but the absolute worst in my eyes is breaking the speed limit when it comes to relationships			1
blink and you miss the courtship with people like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
they ’ve met , married and practically had babies in the time most normal people have gone on a few dates			1
celebrities such as @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 , aka @entity16 , often meet , date and marry quickly @entity15 and her , now ex , husband @entity29 , who proposed to her after they had been dating only a few weeks when we ’re deep in the infatuation stage , all of us want to click our heels three times and whisk ourselves forward to the nice , safe , really committed bit			1
we ’re all guilty of wanting to believe this new person will be by our side forever and the temptation is to race toward the finish line			1
my advice is do n’t – for three good reasons			1
first : you ’ll miss out on all the gorgeous niceties newness provides ( you do n’t quite know if they feel the same way about you and when they confess they do and you both smile stupidly at each other , life ’s wonderful )			2
second : it ’s ridiculous to commit for life when you ’ve only known them for a second of yours			2
third : if you push for intimacy before they ’re ready , they may well run away			1
sometimes it ’s both of you speeding ahead			2
you meet at a party on saturday night , stay up talking till dawn , end up sharing breakfast , then watch the sunday night movie snuggled in each other ’s arms			2
the only thing that stops the marathon date , is having to go to work on monday morning			2
@entity0 says that too much intimacy too fast can be a bad thing it just has to be the start of something wonderful , right ? not necessarily			1
therapists say long - lasting first dates send our expectations soaring ridicu ­ lously high – and few relation ­ ships live up to them			2
when the ‘ magic ’ wears off and real life creeps in , the affair fizzles out faster and leaves you feeling even more disillusioned than normal			0
women are often the ones who push for intimacy too quickly , probably because we ’re so comfortable with it			1
some women go out with their victim ( yep , victim ) once , then call him three times the next day , drag him around to meet mum three dates in , book next year ’s @entity101 dinner on the fourth date and then wonder why the guy ran away so fast he left burn marks on the hallway carpet			0
here ’s why : he figures if you ’re this full - on in the beginning , you ’ll strangle him with intimacy within a few months			1
an astute guy also realizes wanting to be instantly committed is n’t a compliment			0
some women want a relationship and do n’t really care who it ’s with			0
you ’ve also removed the mystery			0
he does n’t have to lie in bed wondering if he ’s really worthy of a girl like you because you ’ve practically proposed already			0
there are many studies that show the longer the courtship , the more likely it is a couple who marry will stay together			0
in one study of couples who lived together before marriage , those who were now divorced had dated for around seven and a half months and lived together for 14 months before marrying			0
the couples who were still married had dated for 20 months then lived together for 16 months before marrying			0
so let ’s all calm down , take a few deep breaths and think logically			0
if you ’re planning on spending the rest of your life with this person , you ’ve got the rest of your life to move in , get married and / or have babies			0
