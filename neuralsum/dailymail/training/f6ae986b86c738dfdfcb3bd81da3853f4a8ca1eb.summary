for many , it was a period of financial turmoil as banks failed , stock markets tumbled and millions lost their jobs			2
however , billionaire @entity5 kept on doing what he does best and began investing in a handful of blue - chip companies during the financial crisis			1
five years on and the value of those deals are clear for all to see , @entity13 ’s second richest man earning another $ 10 billion thanks to his choice investments			1
shrewd : billionaire @entity5 tossed lifelines to a handful of blue - chip companies during the financial crisis and i made this much ! five years later , the payoff on those deals is becoming clear : $ 10 billion and counting buffet 's boost : @entity27 's investments are paying off			1
from an investment of $ 25bn dollars , almost $ 10bn in profits have been realized although it proves that the rich are getting richer , it also confirms that wisdom of one of mr @entity5 's favorite investing maxims : ‘ be fearful when others are greedy , and be greedy when others are fearful			1
’ the fall of 2008 , when the market was shaky and confidence was low , a number of stocks of companies that had decent reputations , were at record lows including @entity44 and @entity45 ‘ you make your best buys when people are overwhelmingly fearful , ’ mr @entity25 said			1
‘ in terms of simple profitability , an average investor could have done just as well investing in the stock market if they bought during the panic period , ’ mr. @entity5 said in an interview to the @entity50 , but few investors , if any , were able to navigate the choppy financial waters quite as expertly			1
sweet smell of success : @entity25 decided to invest in a few major companies and is now seeing a profit of $ 10 billion and counting by comparison , the @entity13 government invested about $ 420 billion through its @entity64			1
the government also demanded beneficial terms and collected sizable dividend payments for a return of about $ 50 billion , or 12 % , thus far , according to the @entity70 's website			0
the latest windfall for the @entity72 , @entity74 billionaire and his conglomerate , @entity27 , came when candy maker @entity76 repaid $ 4.4 billion that its subsidiary , @entity77 , borrowed in 2008			2
that payment alone is expected to net @entity27 a profit of at least $ 680 million			0
mr. @entity5 said he hopes to use the cash to make other big investments soon that will bring equally attractive returns			1
@entity27 will continue to buy stocks to add to its portfolio of over $ 100 billion , because ‘ it 's still better to have equities than cash , ’ he said			2
it all began with @entity76 in april of 2008 , when credit markets began to tighten their belts , however , what meant even more to companies that were craving much - needed capital was mr @entity25			1
however in addition to much - needed capital , the companies acquired something equally valuable : mr. @entity5 's implicit endorsement of their long - term prospects			1
call the midas touch if you will - shares of these companies generally went up after they revealed @entity27 's involvement			2
in six major deals , @entity27 invested a total of about $ 26 billion			2
mr. @entity5 used @entity27 's gigantic cash hoard to move swiftly and exact lucrative terms that created a stream of payments from the borrowers			1
mr. @entity5 's deal - making started in the early days of the crisis and continued deep into the recovery			1
the last of the deals was a 2011 loan to @entity116 for $ 5 billion			2
besides @entity76 and @entity116 , @entity27 made investments in @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121 several deals are continuing to pay hefty dividends			2
cool head : when most panicked during the financial crisis , @entity5 invested as the economy has recovered , and with credit available at more attractive rates , some of the companies have opted to redeem securities owned by @entity27 or adjust the terms in ways favorable to mr. @entity5			1
for example , @entity27 became one of @entity118 ’s largest shareholders with a $ 2.1 billion stake after the close of a five - year deal in which @entity27 injected $ 5 billion into the bank			0
the deal required the bank to pay $ 500 million in annual dividends			0
when @entity118 redeemed the shares in march 2011 , it paid @entity27 an extra $ 500 million as a premium			0
@entity27 helped @entity76 finance its $ 23 billion purchase of @entity77			0
@entity27 contributed $ 6.5 billion , including $ 2.1 billion for preferred stock in @entity77 that pays an annual dividend			0
@entity27 also bought an additional $ 1 billion of @entity77 debt later			0
tthe investment is expected to net @entity27 nearly $ 4 billion , including annual dividends and a prepayment premium since the bonds were due in 2018			0
in another display of mr @entity5 's ingenuity , @entity27 invested $ 5 billion in @entity116 which adds about $ 300 million in annual pretax income			1
the deal allowed @entity25 to purchase another 700 million shares for an additional $ 5 billion at $ 7.14 a share			0
given the bank 's current stock price at about $ 14 , it would create a further profit of $ 5 billion			0
when it comes to affairs of government mr @entity5 does n’t believe holding congress to ransom is the way to pass legislation			2
‘ it makes absolutely no sense for politicians to use the debt ceiling as a threat to get their way on other legislation			0
it ought to be banned as a weapon			0
it should be like nuclear bombs , basically too horrible to use , ’ he said in an interview with @entity170			0
if @entity181 does n’t increase the country 's borrowing power by october 17 , the government wo n’t have enough money to pay its bills , according to treasury secretary @entity186			0
defaulting on the nation 's debt could trigger a global financial meltdown			0
‘ we will go right up to the point of extreme idiocy , but we wo n’t cross it , ’ the @entity5 said last week .			1

@entity5 invested in well known companies at record lows in 2008
investments acted as ' lifelines ' to firms
his endorsement and confidence saw their stock prices rise
sometimes special deals were created with *buyback* options making @entity5 even richer
@entity5 : ' be fearful when others are greedy , and be greedy when others are fearful ’
