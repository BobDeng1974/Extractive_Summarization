conflict : @entity2 @entity1 was a @entity3 activist for 15 years but when she was finally elected , she saw the party 's flaw i grew up thinking that it would impossible for me to have a career in politics			1
i was a transsexual who lived on a council estate and attended a school where a teacher once gleefully led the laughter in class after i said i wanted to become an mp			2
i never thought i would prove them wrong			2
much of my early life was dominated by uneasiness with my body			2
i eventually received treatment in my early 20s and became the woman i had always known i was			2
i refused to discuss this in public			2
was i afraid of ridicule , or that my political views might not subsequently be taken seriously ? perhaps			2
i also did not want ‘ @entity2 ’ to be the default start to every headline			2
i had taken much inspiration from @entity30			2
to me , her message was clear : personal responsibility , hard work , conviction and the ability to achieve regardless of background			2
i met her in 2008 , a year before my election as an mep and told her that i was going to get my country back from the @entity39			2
she said : ‘ never give up ! however long it takes			2
’ i was elected to @entity41 in june 2009 for @entity3 , a party i had been a leading activist with for 15 years			1
it had been a long journey from foot soldier up through the ranks to the national executive committee , party secretary , political adviser and finally @entity2			2
once elected , i could fight the @entity39 from within			2
but i soon discovered why @entity3 has far more former members than current members – @entity51			1
@entity51 and i were always at opposite ends of an eternally feuding party			1
he was a key player in all @entity3 ’s civil wars			1
it was his way of dividing and conquering , and shedding his political opponents			0
today he is on non-speaking terms with four out of the previous six @entity3 leaders			1
in addition , more than 75 @entity60 members have resigned over @entity3 ’s 20 - year history , and nearly all cite @entity51 as the reason			1
last week , miss @entity1 accused @entity51 of employing his wife and his ' mistress ' @entity67 ( right ) @entity51 struggles to get on with anyone			1
people would often face the wrath of his henchmen			0
he would make late - night phone calls to manipulate @entity60 members to vote in a certain way			1
during meetings he would throw tantrums and threaten to resign if he did n’t get his own way			2
‘ i just want to give up , ’ he would shout			0
‘ this f * * * * * * party – i do n’t know why i bother			0
’ the threats would work : party rules were frequently rewritten at @entity51 ’s behest			1
i once remarked that i thought @entity51 had only ever read one novel and that was @entity86 ’s @entity85 – an allegory about @entity88			1
i quipped that he took it as an instruction manual in how to run @entity3			1
trying to organise @entity3 is not l ike organising a political party			1
it is more about organising the events that surround one man ’s ego			0
the @entity96 once ran a piece on him accompanied by the soundtrack to @entity101 ’s @entity100			0
it should be @entity3 ’s anthem			1
i once remarked that @entity51 had only ever read one novel : @entity86 's @entity85 - an allegory about @entity88 - and took it as an instruction manual in how to run @entity3 i first came across his spin doctor @entity67 when she volunteered at @entity3 ’s headquarters in @entity109 in may 2004			1
i had been tipped off that she was potentially a troublemaker , so i gave her mundane office tasks			0
i soon learned what her personality was like – definitely a devoted @entity114 , but , i would argue , highly eccentric and lacking in political acumen			0
@entity51 was not comfortable with me			1
i once remember a group of @entity117 going out for a meal in @entity41 and then ending up in a bar on @entity120			0
a @entity3 mep was making a fool of himself by coming on to a much younger female assistant			1
@entity51 must have seen the disapproval on my face as he came over and said : ‘ what happens over here stays over here			1
’ it was a typical @entity51 warning			1
a more direct threat was made when i objected to @entity3 ’s inclusion in a new @entity131 grouping which included some very right - wing politicians , some of whom had convictions for violence			1
@entity51 needed me to sign up in order for the group to get extra money from the @entity39 for communications – without me it would be one short of 30 meps required to get higher levels of funding			1
he told everyone that i would cost the party £ 500,000 by not signing up			2
to my utter shame i signed the next morning			0
this was not the first time – nor would it be the last – that i feel that i was bullied by @entity51			1
' @entity51 shamed me into signing a bill to save @entity3 money			1
he said i would cost the party £ 500,000 if i did n't ' as @entity117 , we held informal meetings , chaired by @entity51 as party leader			1
one meeting will always stick in my mind			0
we were discussing finances , and this led to a wider discussion as to how @entity39 funding should be spent			0
but i had a few detailed questions about @entity3 ’s money – each of our 13 @entity117 received € 76,000 a year from the @entity39 ’s communications budget , or £ 63,000 ( that ’s € 5 million over a parliamentary term )			1
i challenged him as to whether we would see accounts , and where the money was going			0
his answers were dismissive but i continued to push			0
his fist suddenly hammered down on to the table in front of me			0
i felt the rush of air past my face and jerked backwards			0
‘ stop it ! ’ he screeched			0
‘ you are interrupting the meeting , you are interrupting me , and if you do n’t stop i ’ll ask you to leave			0
’ he shamed me into a voting for something i was against			0
he told everyone i would cost the party £ 500,000 if i did n't sign by the end of 2009 , after more of @entity51 ’s abusive , insulting behaviour towards me , i said i wished to resign from the group			1
once again he tried to use intimidation to prevent me leaving			0
after my resignation in january 2010 he went straight to the @entity96 and began criticising me			0
the party removed the ‘ whip ’ and i became an independent mep			2
soon after @entity194 became prime minister in may 2010 , he said he ‘ did n’t want to bang on about @entity196 ’			0
i noticed a section in the @entity199 agreement that said if a 100,000 - signature petition was submitted it may be considered for debate in the @entity202			0
so i set up a campaign calling for a referendum on @entity206 ’s membership of the @entity39 that collected much more than the required number of signatures			0
we duly forced a debate in 2011 during which 81 @entity211 defied a three - line whip by supporting calls for a referendum			0
neither @entity3 nor @entity51 supported the campaign			1
yet on the day of the debate , he sought to claim the credit			0
i later challenged him , pointing out that he was not one of the signatories			0
he belatedly scribbled his name on the petition			0
all of a sudden the party was interested in taking me back			0
chief executive @entity222 invited me to a meeting with @entity51 at the @entity224 in @entity225			1
' now , he is accusing me of smearing because i revealed he had been employing his wife and @entity228 ' i was offered a place on @entity3 ’s list for this year ’s @entity196 elections in exchange for the petition ’s database			1
this would have breached data protection laws and negotiations broke down			0
@entity51 is a hypocrite and a bully			1
he talks a good game , but in 15 years as an mep he – unlike me – can not point to one tangible achievement that has moved an ‘ in / out ’ referendum closer			1
he has no time for intelligent women			0
he is fine with adoring , submissive females , but not those who stand up to him			0
there is no woman in a senior position in @entity3 now who was in that post five years ago			1
when i was the only woman on the @entity60 , the committee would hold meetings in the bars of gentlemen ’s clubs – i was not permitted to join them			0
my intervention in the @entity131 last week – where i asked @entity51 about the claim that he employs his wife @entity260 and ‘ former mistress ’ using taxpayers ’ money – wrongfooted a normally savvy and quick - thinking politician			1
he failed to use his parliamentary right of reply to instantly dismiss the allegations , or offer an explanation			2
instead , @entity51 left it to his spin doctors in an attempt to deflect the question			1
@entity3 members are fantastic people			1
unfortunately , they are lions led by a preening show pony yes , i have been on bail since 2012 over allegations of fraud			2
i strenuously deny the claims			2
i have audited accounts that show that i have ploughed more than £ 100,000 of my own post-tax salary since 2009 back into my work as an mep			2
there have been smears aplenty from @entity51 ’s office , including that i am a coward for using parliamentary privilege to make claims about @entity51 , his wife and @entity228			1
they forget that @entity51 used this same privilege in 2004 when making accusations against @entity196 commissioner @entity293			1
others claim i ’m an embittered @entity295			0
i ’m hardly alone there ! i did not become an mep to make history			1
i sought election to stand up for the silent majority , those whose voices are ignored by the arrogant political class			0
@entity3 does not do this			1
@entity3 members are fantastic people			1
unfortunately , they are lions led by a preening show pony			0
it is a shame that a party set up on principles has allowed itself to become one man ’s ego trip			0
the future of our country is more important than that			0
representing the @entity316 , i am hopeful of re-election			0
it is my list of political achievements , not my personal struggles , for which i hope to be recognised and remembered .			0

@entity1 was a @entity3 activist for 15 years before becoming an mep
@entity324 is the reason there are more former members than current
claims he pressured her into signing votes against her judgement and will
last week claimed he employed mistress and wife at taxpayers ' *expense*
the fee for this *article* is being *donated* to the @entity344 and the @entity345 .
last week , **mr** @entity51 and ms @entity67 denied the claims of an affair . speaking last night , **mr** @entity51 , in response to ms @entity1 's allegations , said : ' one or two of those things she said make me very angry . the idea that i would threaten her in any way is wholly untrue . as for the rest of the stuff ? i do n't see why i should answer to her . she can say what she likes .
