scroll down to see the million pound invention ... father and son : @entity11 and @entity12 on @entity39 did what many before them had not - turned down the panels ' offer but it was ' the right call , ' @entity12 said @entity46 giant @entity45 has placed an order of 5,000 units , @entity44 is also listing the product and there has been significant interest from companies as far away as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
endorsed by professional gardener and broadcaster @entity59 , the product costs £ 12.99			2
rejected : ' @entity7 ' @entity14 ( pictured ) and @entity16 offered £ 50,000 for 50 per cent of the @entity27 ' company but the pair have gone on to accept orders from @entity45 and is listed on @entity44 selling out : @entity63 demonstrates invention @entity64 which the panel on tv show the @entity39 offered just £ 50,000 for			1
they now expect to net £ 1.3m in sales next year alone when the father and son went on @entity7 ’ @entity1 in march , which aired last month , they were offered £ 50,000 for half their gardening company @entity73 but the ‘ dragons ’ were left reeling when @entity11 , 54 , bluntly refused , telling them he would give away no more than 11.5 per cent of the company			1
@entity12 , 32 , said : ‘ i guess it could be seen as a mistake on our part but then again it may turn out to be the best thing we have done			2
‘ not many people turn down the dragons , but we made the right call			0
‘ we had been in front of the dragons for two hours and i think my dad had just had enough of it			0
selling 100,000 units a year : the @entity18 is a canvas product which increases the capacity of a wheelbarrow by 300 per cent ‘ he only agreed to go on the show after i asked him , he thought sir @entity98 was on it ! ‘ for the projections we gave them , we only needed to have sold 25,000 units for them to get their money back			1
’ after starting off with 1,000 in stock which quickly sold out , @entity11 and @entity12 , based in @entity108 , are getting orders faster than they can produce them			1
@entity12 said : ‘ we have self - financed it so far but will need outside investment when we take it to more and more countries			2
stuck to his guns : @entity63 ( right ) was lectured by the panel including @entity118 ( left ) for their attitude towards the offer ' undervalued ' : the pair demonstrating their invention on the @entity39 believed they only needed to sell 25,000 units for the ' dragons ' to get their money 's worth ‘ we ca n't keep up with demand , to a point			1
this week i had enquiries about how much we would charge for 25,000 , then how much for 50,000			0
’ the @entity7 ’ @entity1 features entrepreneurs who pitch their business ideas to a panel of venture capitalists or ‘ dragons ’ to secure investment finance			0
the panel then judge how much money , if any , to invest in the invention in return for a percentage of the inventor ’s company			0
but the ‘ dragons ’ do not always get their judgement right			0
endorsement : the product ( left ) which costs £ 12.99 per unit , has been endorsed by professional gardener and broadcaster @entity59 @entity155 , who appeared on the show in 2009 pitched his @entity158 idea which was branded a ‘ ridiculous idea ’ by ‘ dragon ’ @entity159			0
the invention which stops tables wobbling went on to become a success and mr @entity155 has just signed a deal to distribute the @entity158 in @entity55			0
a buoyancy aid for children , shaped like a shark ’s fin was laughed off the show in 2006 , deemed ‘ dangerous ’ and ‘ silly ’ but inventor @entity170 ignored their advice and registered worldwide patents and started @entity173 from his home garage			0
in its first year of trading , @entity173 sales reached £ 70,000 across nearly 50 countries and were popular particularly in @entity53 where it was exhibited at the @entity180 .			2
