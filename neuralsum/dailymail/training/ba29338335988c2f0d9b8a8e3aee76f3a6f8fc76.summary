by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 qualified fastest for monday 's men ’s 100 metres semi-finals and said he is capable of breaking the 10 - second barrier for the first time to win a medal here in @entity8			1
in a world - class field boasting the likes of @entity12 and @entity13 , both of whom have run comfortably under 10 seconds this year , it was the 20 - year - old @entity16 who recorded the fastest time			1
we should , of course , not get too carried away with two races for @entity20 still to navigate before he could step up onto the podium at @entity23 , but there is a growing confidence about the former world junior champion			1
flying : @entity1 coasted through to the semi-finals of the 100m with a time of 10.15secs confident : @entity1 believes he can break the 10 - second barrier in @entity8 over the next week he may still refuse to conform to tired sprinting stereotypes by smiling rather than growling at the start of his races , but @entity1 now believes he not only belongs along such elite athletes , but that he is capable of beating them			1
‘ i do n’t see why i ca n’t realistically make the final and hopefully be pushing for a medal			2
i think i ’m going to have to break 10 seconds to get a gold medal , but i feel i have been fit enough to do it for a while , weather - permitting , ’ he said			2
‘ you do have to believe in yourself in sprinting			0
as much as people say “ there are big egos ” you do have to have a big confidence in yourself that you can do it and execute it with the world ’s best			0
it is just how you prepare yourself on the day			0
’ but @entity53 , the world 400m record - holder , criticised the 20 - year - old ’s performance on the @entity58 , advising @entity20 to stop looking like he is simply enjoying the occasion			1
‘ i was n’t that excited by @entity1 ’s performance , ’ said @entity53			2
‘ what has impressed me so much over the last couple of years is his technique , and he looked a little tight there			0
‘ he has n’t run in a while and he ’s been through a coaching change , so that may have something to do with it			0
when he runs well , i ’d like to see him look a little more like he expects that , not like : “ @entity70 , that was really great			0
” ’ while it was true @entity1 did not coast through his heat like @entity13 or @entity12 , who only qualified as a fastest loser after coming third in 10.33secs , the @entity16 ’s refusal to take himself too seriously has been a key to his success			1
he is a former @entity79 and @entity80 full back who only burst onto the scene two years ago			0
impressed : @entity1 praised the ' unbelievable ' crowd that cheered him on at @entity23 while it was true @entity1 did not coast through his heat like @entity13 or @entity12 , who only qualified as a fastest loser after coming third in 10.33secs , the @entity16 ’s refusal to take himself too seriously has been a key to his success			1
he is a former @entity79 and @entity80 full back who only burst onto the scene two years ago			0
@entity20 still combines full - time training with @entity93 ’s fastest active sprinter , @entity92 , under coach @entity94 in @entity95 — after switching from @entity97 - based @entity96 — with studying for a degree in sports and exercise science at the @entity101			1
maintaining such a grounded sense of perspective in what could be a dizzying world is no bad thing , surely			0
fellow englishmen @entity107 and @entity109 also progressed to today ’s semi-finals , running 10.33secs and 10.34secs respectively			1
but @entity114 ’s four - time @entity113 champion @entity112 , who is legally blind , missed out on a place in the semi-finals after clocking 10.66secs			2
afterwards @entity109 , the 60m world indoor champion , dedicated his @entity119 campaign and season to his close friend @entity120 , who drowned after swimming in the @entity121 on monday			2
through : @entity109 , left , and @entity107 will both join @entity20 in the semi-finals @entity109 said the 20 - year - old ’s death was ‘ absolutely devastating ’ and added : ‘ @entity120 was the most loving guy you will ever meet			1
this games and the whole of my 2014 season will be dedicated to him			0
’ @entity16 ’s three female 100m sprinters — @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 — all progressed to the semi-finals , with @entity129 the pick of the three in running 11.37secs to finish second in her heat			1
@entity138 ’s @entity137 qualified quickest overall in 11.20secs , with the dangerous @entity142 trio of @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 also impressive			0
but @entity146 and @entity148 's @entity147 , the second quickest woman in the world this year and one of the favourites for the title , suffered her first 100m defeat for 10 races			2
the 22 - year - old was clearly hampered by her heavily strapped left hamstring as she recorded only 11.52secs , and later withdrew from the @entity125			1
pushing herself : @entity16 's @entity129 , right , qualified from her 100m heat on sunday semi-finals await : @entity130 , left , and @entity131 , right , are also through to the 100m semi-finals @entity125 - day 4 review if the 44,000 - strong @entity23 crowd were disappointed at the absence of double world and @entity168 champion @entity167 from the men ’s 5,000m final on sunday night they did not show it ; cheering every throw , jump and track performance with equal gusto			1
disqualifications , false starts , dead heats and yet another rendition of the @entity180 ’ ‘ i ’m @entity181 ) ’ — spare us please , @entity8 — even seemed to go down well			2
yet had @entity185 , 31 , felt he was in good enough shape to take his place on the start line , his battle against 5,000m gold medallist @entity183 would have been interesting			0
the @entity189 has an impressive kick and ran 13mins 12.07secs — significantly quicker than @entity185 managed in his only track outing this season — to win the title			0
@entity183 is only 21 : a battle between him and @entity185 can wait for another day .			0

@entity20 won his heat in 10.15secs , but *insisted* there was more to come
he sealed a spot in the sem - finals as the fastest qualifier in the heats
the 20 - year - old 's @entity16 team - mates @entity109 and @entity107 also advanced to the next round
@entity1 praised the ' unbelievable ' support from the @entity23 crowd
