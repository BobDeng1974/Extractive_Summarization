by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 10:54 est , 21 september 2012 he was @entity2 's most celebrated pilot of the @entity3 , who lost both legs in a plane crash , yet went on to help the @entity7 beat the @entity8 in the air			1
but a new documentary , while confirming his aerial brilliance , has trashed sir @entity14 's ' @entity13 ' tactics that used up to 60 @entity16 planes to smash through the enemy in a cluster			1
veterans who served with him say this was a sluggish way to attack and put many other pilots at risk			1
hero : sir @entity14 , pictured during the war , was a celebrated pilot but his tactics have been criticised in a new documentary critic : wing commander @entity30 , pictured , said that @entity13 's success was overrated , adding it was slow and dangerous wing commander @entity30 , 93 , who received the @entity33 and @entity34 and who had 15 confirmed kills in the war has taken part in the @entity40 programme			1
' they always arrived after the action , ' he told the @entity43			0
' we would be arriving home with our tongues hanging out and we 'd see these 60 aircraft in close formation coming overhead , going , " where is all the enemy ? " well , they 'd all gone home			1
' they were claiming 20 , 25 , 30 aircraft shot down but as far as we were concerned no aircraft were shot down			1
the claims by @entity13 always seemed exaggerated			1
' another pilot said simply : ' @entity13 was absolute nonsense , ' @entity14 's story is an infamous one that later made it to the big screen			1
in the 1930s he lost both his legs in an air crash , but rather than being a disability he used it to his advantage and returned to flying			0
many airmen passed out because of the g - forces , which caused blood to rush from their heads to their legs very quickly			1
but because of @entity14 's 1931 accident he had no such problems and could push himself , his body and his aircraft to the absolute limit			2
incredible : fighter pilot @entity14 lost both his legs in a flying accident in 1931 but overcame his disability , rejoined the @entity16 in 1939 , and commanded the @entity84 during the @entity85 celebrated : sir @entity14 's exploits in the war made him a hero in @entity2 and was even recognised by the @entity8 despite his various attempts to escape captivity legend : in august 1941 he was shot down over @entity93 and he was captured by @entity8 forces - pictured here - and used for propaganda purposes from the moment sir @entity14 's plane crashed in 1931 , it appeared he would be lucky to live , let alone fly again			1
while trying low - flying aerobatics his aircraft crashed when the tip of the left wing touched the ground and both his legs were amputated â€“ one above and one below the knee			1
but he would n't be deterred and managed to rejoin the @entity16 in 1939 when war broke out and within two years he was a squadron leader			0
in 1941 he was shot down and captured in @entity106			0
@entity8 forces treated @entity14 with great respect			0
he lost his prosthetic leg when he bailed out and the @entity8 allowed a new one to be dropped in by the @entity2			0
from then came his series of escapes			0
he tried so many the @entity8 threatened to take away his legs			0
@entity14 escaped from a hospital by tying together a number of sheets but was betrayed by a hospital worker			0
after the war , the @entity106 authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison			0
in 1942 he escaped with three others from @entity122 only to be found a few days later - the @entity8 were so concerned by his attempts they produced a poster describing him and how he walked so the public could spot him if he fled again			2
finally he was sent to @entity126 staying there until the end of the war - but he had tried his best to get out before then			2
he became even more celebrated after he bailed out over @entity106 in the summer of 1941 , falling into @entity8 hands			2
for the remainder of the war he was a constant thorn in the enemy 's side , successfully escaping with other @entity2 from various camps they put him in			0
he managed to evade the @entity8 for days at a time during various thrilling escapes - almost making it back to @entity2 on more than on occasion			2
finally he was put in @entity126 , but despite further attempts to get out , he failed , staying there until the end of the war			0
heroes of the @entity40 started last night on @entity144 , and is formed of six , one - hour documentaries			2
' big wing ' was @entity14 's brainchild and he managed to convince @entity149 sir @entity148 , who led the defence of the @entity151 , that it worked and it should be used			2
but distinguished air vice-marshal @entity152 , whose area was @entity154 and the south east , disagreed as he wanted smaller and faster teams to attack the @entity8			0
however , he was replaced by @entity148 , who decided to use @entity13 more widely			1
and the tactic continues to be popular with other veterans , who defended @entity13			1
sir @entity159 , 95 , who was @entity14 's wingman and had at least 20 confirmed kills in battle said : ' it was very logical and very @entity164 was a marvellous leader , a brilliant pilot , a dead shot and everything you relished			0
in a final tribute to his friend , who died in 1982 , ' he did n't just save my life , he saved a hell of a lot of lives , ' sir @entity159 said			0
tactic : this modern reenactment over @entity179 shows planes using @entity13 , which used up to 60 planes to fly at the enemy			1

his ' @entity13 ' theory - *previously* celebrated - has been *slammed* by veterans in a new *tv* film
wing commander @entity30 , 93 is one who said it was slow and dangerous
' we would be arriving home with our tongues hanging out and we 'd see these 60 aircraft in close formation coming overhead , he said
