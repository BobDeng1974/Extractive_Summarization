in my career , i never spat at anybody			2
it ’s such a disgusting act and is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to another human being			2
in some cultures , people do spit on the floor when they ’re angry , but i ca n’t understand why people would spit at all			2
@entity12 certainly is n’t part of one of those cultures			1
i do n’t understand why people do it , but i did think there was some provocation on wednesday night			1
@entity20 defender @entity12 ( left ) and @entity21 have been charged with spitting during the game @entity12 and @entity21 were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on wednesday night @entity21 has accepted a possible seven - game ban while @entity12 has until 6pm on friday , february 6 to respond it looked like @entity21 ran his studs down @entity12 ’s achilles and also made a straight - legged challenge on him			1
that ’s why we saw a transformation in the seemingly mild - mannered @entity12			1
he says he was unaware of any spitting incident , but i find that hard to believe			1
i was once spat at during a game in @entity38 while i was playing for @entity39			1
it was supposed to be a pre-season friendly but it was anything but			2
our bus was even stoned by local fans			2
when i was spat at , it was right into my face			0
but it was n’t a case of being so angry i wanted to hit him , i was mostly just shocked			0
it was an abusive act and it is unacceptable			0
@entity54 ( top left ) was caught biting @entity56 during a @entity58 clash in april 2013 the @entity60 defender appeals to the referee , with @entity54 later receiving an eight - game ban for biting as for punishment , you could argue it is as bad as , if not worse , than biting — and @entity54 , then of @entity66 , received an eight - match ban for biting @entity56			1
biting causes physical pain , but that is almost a childish , instinctive reaction			1
to spit in someone ’s face is more deliberate and insulting			0
for me , spitting is worse			1
but i do n’t think spitting merits more than a three - match ban			1
yes , there has to be a suspension , but it ’s more important to educate players as to how badly incidents such as these come across to those watching the game , particularly youngsters			2
‘ having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night ’s match			0
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity21			1
‘ i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor			2
' during the game @entity21 and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting			1
‘ it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do			0
it is certainly not something that i did last night			0
’ the games he @entity110 : @entity111 ( h ) , monday ; @entity113 ( h ) , march 15 ; @entity66 ( a ) , march 22 ; @entity115 ( h ) , april 4 ; @entity117 ( h ) april 12 ; @entity60 ( a ) april 18			0
‘ i have apologies to make to a lot of people today			0
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to @entity12 , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and @entity12			1
‘ i reacted to something i found very unpleasant			0
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment			0
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down			0
‘ i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry			0
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it			0
’ the games he ’ll miss for @entity146 : @entity39 ( a ) , march 15 ; @entity111 ( h ) , march 21 ; @entity148 ( a ) , april 5 ; @entity66 ( a ) , april 13 ; @entity113 ( h ) , april 19 ; @entity150 ( h ) , april 25 ; @entity152 ( a ) , may 2 .			1
