@entity1 playmaker @entity0 failed to live up to his £ 60million price - tag once again on wednesday night with his main flaw surrounding his inability to pick out a red shirt			1
@entity6 , who looked incredibly disappointed after being hauled off in the 59th minute , was @entity1 's worst passer with a passing accuracy percentage of 63.6 per cent			1
@entity9 's decision to replace the @entity11 's record signing with @entity12 comes just days after @entity6 was hooked off at the interval against @entity14 following another below - par performance against @entity17 's side			0

the likes of @entity32 ( 90.7 per cent ) , @entity35 ( 90.3 per cent ) and late substitute @entity36 ( 100 per cent ) all impressed on the ball during their side 's slender 1 - 0 win over @entity53			2
