it was the match billed by @entity1 as the ' @entity2 versus the @entity3 '			1
and there were times at @entity6 when both back lines showed as much defensive acumen as a bunch of hungover , overweight blokes chasing around cluelessly on a muddy park pitch			2
in the end , however , it was @entity14 who were made to look the more amateurish as @entity16 took their chances to record a resounding win over their old rivals			1
@entity22 , at the heart of @entity16 's defence , deals with the threat of @entity14 's @entity24 @entity25 , on the right side of @entity16 's defence , goes shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity28 early on @entity29 reflects on an incredibly disappointing afternoon for @entity14 against their old rivals on another afternoon , @entity24 might have succeeded in his personal duel with @entity31 and claimed a hat - trick			1
frankly , @entity33 might have done likewise in the second - half but for the @entity37 goalkeeper 's defiant , dominant performance			2
it could have been 3 - 3 , even 5 - 3 to @entity14			1
but somehow , through a combination of @entity31 's brilliance , some defensive improvisation and , most importantly , clinical finishing , @entity16 emerged victorious			1
it was most definitely a case of square pegs into round holes with the team selections			0
@entity47 once again reverted to the back three that has made @entity16 look so vulnerable this season			2
nobody looks entirely comfortable - still - but the @entity52 coach hoped the inclusion of @entity22 in the centre would act as a lightning rod for the nervousness this system usually generates			0
either side of him was @entity60 , barely back from his injury lay - off but needed after @entity62 picked up another injury in training on saturday , and @entity25			0
@entity14 favoured a back three as well , with @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity29 matching @entity16 's approach			1
@entity68 was on hand to track back if required			0
@entity24 gets in behind @entity25 but is denied at the near post by @entity31 @entity25 earned himself a booking for this foul on @entity73 close to the halfway line @entity14 defender @entity29 competes for the ball with @entity76 at @entity6 it was bold , especially for a team entering the game off the back of a deflating week that had seen them crash out of the @entity83 , but @entity14 started very positively			1
the chaos that is @entity16 's back line this season was evident immediately as @entity73 whipped in a second - minute corner and @entity16 needed several swings of the boot to clear the danger			1
@entity91 's tendency to look for a backwards pass rather than an adventurous one heaped unnecessary pressure on @entity25 and @entity22 early on and @entity16 certainly did n't look like a side entering the fixture off the back of five consecutive wins			2
the @entity16 back line was carved open for the first time on 11 minutes , caught gawping as @entity28 's through pass set @entity24 one - on - one with @entity31 , the @entity37 goalkeeper standing tall to block in what would become a running theme of the afternoon			1
25 seconds later , @entity14 had been punished for the miss in ruthless fashion			0
@entity68 and @entity104 were confused by @entity105 , who nutmegged the latter and crossed for @entity107 to sweep the ball home			0
goalkeeper @entity110 , in for the woeful @entity111 , did n't exactly cover himself in glory by diving early and completely the wrong way			0
@entity107 's opener resulted from @entity105 getting past @entity104 on the right wing @entity25 slides in to try and dispossess the dangerous @entity24 @entity68 slides in on @entity25 - one of many meaty challenges during the first half perhaps former @entity16 defender @entity119 put it best , tweeting : ' the way @entity122 just stood up them 3 lfc defenders & @entity125 breezed was nuts			1
' the way @entity107 was allowed to steam in unchecked by any @entity14 defender was as alarming for @entity127			2
while @entity22 was having the intended effect at centre - half , a model of consistency in his passing and reading of the play , @entity25 was finding @entity24 a handful			2
he was again rescued by @entity31 on 23 minutes , when his @entity137 colleague turned him with ease			0
@entity25 was senselessly anticipating a cut - back , @entity24 left him looking like a statue			2
some of the challenges were seismic , as you might expect from this fixture			0
@entity25 and @entity60 went into the book for tripping @entity73 during the first - half , walking a tightrope			0
@entity91 was booked too , to nobody 's surprise			0
@entity65 was n't injured by one of these thunderous challenges but felt something in his groin and limped off , to be replaced by @entity153			0
@entity154 doubled @entity16 's lead from an offside position five minutes before half - time but it showed something of @entity14 's lack of confidence that only one of their defenders bothered appealing			1
@entity22 's heat map shows his influence in @entity16 's defence @entity66 gets the better of @entity16 striker @entity166 during an aerial battle @entity65 walks off after suffering a first - half injury during the match at @entity6 five minutes into the second - half and @entity16 's defensive gremlins surfaced again			1
@entity60 played a slack back pass , allowing @entity24 to run through one - on - one with @entity31			1
again , the goalkeeper prevailed , @entity6 breathing a sigh of relief			0
@entity14 continued to push , the game was not up in their eyes			0
@entity33 , introduced at half - time , was thwarted initially by a superb @entity25 slide tackle , before @entity31 pushed his resultant snapshot against the crossbar			1
where @entity16 would be without the young keeper is unthinkable			0
certainly not in third place , probably not even in the top half			0
far more than being a much - needed last line of defence , he 's been a match - winner in at least half - a - dozen games this season already			2
@entity14 's greatest defensive shambles of the afternoon allowed @entity16 to wrap it up 20 minutes from the end			1
@entity29 's clearance of @entity107 's low ball was atrocious , falling straight to @entity154 who wisely shifted the ball wide to the unmarked @entity199			1
with @entity25 again diving too soon , the @entity52 swept the ball into an empty net			0
the @entity2 would be proud			0
@entity14 's defence were caught hopelessly out of position for @entity199 's third @entity31 denies @entity24 after the @entity14 man had got beyond @entity25 @entity31 celebrates after @entity76 scores @entity16 's third goal with 20 minutes left			1

@entity16 beat @entity14 3 - 0 at @entity6
@entity208 pundit @entity1 had billed it as a @entity211 *pub* game , such is the poor quality of both defences
@entity31 rescued @entity16 's back line on several **occasion*s* as @entity24 and @entity33 saw chances saved
but @entity14 's defence were carved open on *occasion* , especially for @entity107 's first goal and @entity76 's third
