they are the epitome of survival against the odds , enduring some of the most hostile weather conditions on the planet on a continent that is almost completely barren			0
now scientists have gained a valuable insight into how penguins are able to cope with the extreme cold , high winds and months of darkness they experience in @entity13			1
genetic analysis of the genomes of two species of penguin - emperor penguins , the largest of the family , and their smaller cousins @entity14 penguins - has revealed some of their secrets to survival			1
adélie penguins have eight genes for metabolising fat , which may allow them to adapt quickly to warmer conditions but could leave them struggling in colder weather when food sources are more scarce researchers found that the penguins have a vast number of genes responsible for creating the raw material needed for feathers - proteins known as beta - keratins			1
they carry more genes for a particular type of beta keratin than any other bird and it is thought this is what allows them develop their thick plumage of short , stiff feathers that keep them warm			1
in a story of enduring love and epic journeys , scientists have identified one of the most faithful couples in the animal kingdom - a pair of @entity57 penguins			2
while most of these penguins usually have short romances as their pairings are cut short by the death of one of the penguins during their long sea journeys or a failure to successfully produce chicks , biologists from the @entity59 of @entity60 discovered one pair whose relationship has spanned more than 16 years			0
despite spending long periods apart , each taking solo trips totalling 200,000 miles , the pair have remained a couple for most of their breeding life , returning each year to the same nest and each other to produce a new brood of chicks			0
dr @entity82 , a researcher at the @entity59 of @entity60 and president of the @entity84 , has followed the couple through their relationship			0
his work has shown that tragically , most @entity89 penguins are precariously balanced			0
if a couple ever fails to successfully hatch their chicks then they will “ divorce ” , leaving each other to find new partners			0
the longest relationships between penguins previously seen by researchers have been between five and ten years before tragedy strikes and they fail to breed successfully			0
yet the long lasting relationship of one couple on the @entity102 coastline of southern @entity60 has shown that it is possible to beat the odds			0
the densely packed and barbed feathers also trap air to keep them buoyant and remain waterproof while they are swimming , allowing them to reach speeds of up to 22 mph in some species			0
the scientists also discovered that penguins have a gene called @entity114 , which in humans is known to be involved in a dermatological disease characterised by thick skin on the palms and feet			1
it believe these genes may help the penguins develop a uniquely thick skin compared to other birds			1
the dna analysis also revealed that these two species of penguin have very different mechanisms for storing fat , which helps insulate them from the cold and survive long periods without eating			1
male emperor penguins can survive for up to four months without food while incubating their eggs from the @entity13 storms as the females forage out at sea for fish			1
the researchers found three key genes that they believe may help them to store fat			2
however , @entity14 penguins have eight genes involved in metabolising fat , which may explain why they have been able to adapt more quickly to changes in climate			1
professor @entity146 , associate director of the @entity147 in @entity148 , who oversaw the study , said : ' @entity151 show distinct evolution relative to other bird species			0
' they ca n't fly , have specialized skin and feathers , degenerated wings , and live in a cold environment in which most other birds could not survive			1
' comparative genomics is a powerful tool for providing answers on the molecular basis of these evolutionary changes and how organisms deal with the conditions they are exposed to			0
' our study has revealed several of these secrets for the two penguins			0
' the expansion of keratinocyte β - keratin genes and the positive selection on @entity175 and @entity114 may have contributed to generating the unique skin and feathers in penguins			1
' researchers took blood samples from @entity14 ( pictured ) on @entity181 in @entity13 emperor penguins endure some of the coldest conditions on @entity184 as they incubate their eggs through the @entity13 winter , but they have unique genes for storing fat and growing dense plumage to keep warm the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity193 , analysed the dna of a male emperor penguin found on @entity196 , near @entity197 in east @entity13 and a male @entity14 from @entity181 in the @entity198 of @entity13			1
they were conducting their study as part of the @entity201 , which is aimed at unraveling the avian tree of life			0
the genetic research showed that penguins first appeared on @entity184 around 60 million years ago			0
@entity206 and @entity14 penguins evolved from a common ancestor around 23 million years ago			1
the study also showed that the @entity14 penguin population increased rapidly about 150,000 years ago when the climate became warmer , but later declined by 40 % about 60,000 years ago , when the weather became colder and drier			2
in contrast , the emperor penguin population remained stable , suggesting that they were better adapted to glacial conditions			0
the study has also helped to shed light on the evolution of penguins ' short wings which they use to ' fly ' through the water rather than the air like their avian cousins			2
the scientists found 17 genes in the penguin genomes taht had unique changes , with one in particular , called @entity229 , showing a large number of genetic changes compared to other birds			1
mutations in @entity234 in humans are known to cause @entity237 syndrom , which causes sufferers to have short - limb dwarfism and short ribs			0
it is possible that changes in this gene is what caused the stubby wings in penguins			0
emperor penguins can go without food for upto four months while waiting for their chicks to hatch , which requires them to have specially adapted metabolisms for storing and using fat through in the cold winter adélie and emperor penguins have adapted to the low light conditions they endure during the @entity13 winter @entity151 aquatic lifestyle and the long periods of darkness during the @entity13 winter have also taken their toll on the penguins eyesight			1
the scientists compared the penguin genome to 48 other bird species			2
they found that while most birds had four classes of genes for photosensitive proteins in their cone cells of their eyes , @entity14 and emperor penguins had just three			1
it is possible the penguins lost the need for these proteins in their eyes due to the poor light quality they experience			2
however , emperor penguins , which breed in the winter , had extra genes that are thought to improve the activity of their rod cells - the retinal cells that detect low levels of light - while @entity14 , which breed in the spring and summer , did not have these			1
professor @entity146 added : ' @entity290 changes in the epidermis and forelimbs are critical for underwater flight in penguins , so the candidate genes that we discovered in this study are highly valuable for future functional studies			2
' the genes involved in light transduction and lipid metabolism exhibit signals of positive selection or pseudogenization in penguins , suggesting their evolutionary responses to the extreme conditions of light and temperature in @entity13			2
' the genetic studies will help scientists understand how penguins will adapt to future changes in the climate however , the findings could also help scientists predict how the penguins will be able to adapt to changing climate conditions in the future			2
dr @entity318 , team lead at the @entity320 in @entity148 , @entity321 , said : ' these different patterns in historical population change also suggest that future climate change may have impacts on the two penguin species			0
' for example , the fact that emperor penguins did n't experience the same population boom as @entity14 penguins in warm climates means that they could suffer more from global warming , and this needs to be considered in conservation efforts in @entity13			1
' professor @entity337 , an evolutionary biologist who also took part in the study at @entity340 , @entity341 , added : ' although @entity14 and emperor penguins both breed on the @entity13 continent , they do so in very different ways			1
' by sequencing the genomes of two penguin species we have been able to compare many of the genes that are responsible for these different abilities to do the same thing - namely to survive and breed in @entity13			0
' this study is particularly important because it now provides us with the opportunity to conduct large scale evolutionary studies of both species			0

penguins have 13 genes for protein that helps form their dense plumage
their eyes have fewer genes compared to other birds but emperor penguins carry more genes for seeing in low light than @entity14 penguins
they also carry several genes linked to thick skin *disorders* in humans
their fat metabolisms help them survive the cold winters but may also leave them *vulnerable* to changes in climate , the scientists warn
