clearly inspired by @entity3 ' words ' do unto others as you would have them do unto you ' , a pair of @entity1 mixed martial artists knock each other out with simultaneous blows to their privates			2
filmed for the now released ' @entity13 ' documentary , the two fighters are part of the burgeoning @entity1 mixed martial arts movement that espouses the mantra , ' @entity3 never quit , he never tapped out			1
' indeed , the documentary , which was funded by $ 30,000 raised through crowd sourcing , attempts to answer the hard questions raised by combining religion and extreme physical violence , such as , ' can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can ? ' scroll down for @entity27 moment of impact : this is the sickening double knee to the privates from each fighter which leaves them both sprawled on the canvas pain : the two fighters are contorted in pain on the canvas after striking each other at the same time during a fight introducing themselves before the fight , one of the two men who knock each other expresses his desire to get closer to @entity45 during the brutal battle			1
' the hope is that through the fight i can create a relationship with person i am fighting and @entity52 too , ' says the fighter			1
' if i win the fight its because @entity45 gave me that fight , it 's not anything i have done			1
' ' its already been decided who won			2
it 's just you wait to find our what happens ' after the unfortunate result , the fighter sits in the dressing room with a bag of ice cooling over his now battered privates			0
you 'll be okay : one of the @entity71 fighter 's is left to struggle with his injury in the aftermath of the fight his pastor and leading light in the evangelical mixed martial arts world , @entity78 , blesses him			1
' @entity45 thank you for the win			1
thank you for making ( the fighter ) him ok and still walking , ' says @entity78			2
' i pray there is no damage , nothing swells up badly here ( his testicles ) and @entity45 i just thank you for the safety out there			1
' focusing on senior pastor @entity78 and his @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and its offshoot @entity71 school , @entity91 , ' @entity13 ' explores the contradictions inherent in fighting and organised @entity1			1
senior pastor @entity78 at his @entity90 in @entity88 , @entity89 , is an avid proponent of @entity71 and evangelical christianity theology student and @entity71 expert @entity96 ( left ) prays while @entity78 preaches to his flock ' in life there are times when you take shots cause its a battle out there and the enemy is trying to seek and destroy us , ' explained @entity78 to his congregation in a scene from ' @entity13 '			1
' he wants to destroy your families , he wants to destroy you personally			0
' that 's where the bible gives you your training			0
' directed by @entity119 winning short film - maker , @entity121 , ' @entity13 ' travels the country to interview religious @entity71 figures			1
' people may say , mixed martial arts is wrong , @entity3 told everybody to turn the other cheek , ' says ' @entity129 ' @entity128 to the camera			0
' i would be really quick to say , ' this is probably not the church for you ! ' the greatest example is in scripture where @entity3 was a fighter			0
' that is the type of @entity3 that i want to serve			0
' two evangelical christians pummel each other in a caged ring at a @entity71 fight encouraged by church goers mixing violent language with religious talk , the pastors in the documentary are unequivocal in their beliefs			1
' there are definitely a lot of people who think there is a contradiction between fighting and @entity1 , ' explains @entity96 , who studies theology and owns a @entity71 gym in @entity154 , @entity155			2
' this is two participants entering into a ring or a cage saying , we 're gon na test each other today and the best man 's gon na win			0
' mixed @entity161 in illegal in @entity89 and the film explores the conflict between @entity78 and the state legislature in @entity165			2
' personally i would prefer to have a full @entity71 competition here at the church , but that is not legal in the state of @entity89 , ' explains @entity78 the congregation is offered @entity71 , boxing and self defence lessons in tandem with their religious classes @entity78 encourages his flock from the stands as the audience made up of his congregation cheers another fight on appalled at his lobbbying for @entity71 licenses at his church , a state official articulates his opposition			1
' it befuddles me why somebody , especially a minister would try to take this to the next level of violence , ' says the official			0
in an indication that ' @entity13 ' intends to pull no punches , children are seen involving themselves in the fighting			1
' i ' am gon na go in there and rip this kids head off , ' says one particularly enthusiastic @entity71 child fighter			0
mixed @entity161 is the fastest growing sport in the @entity201 sadly though , one of the brave children comes off worst in a @entity71 fight with a smaller kid and ca n't help but cry			1
for the filmakers , the mixing of violence and religion is fascinating			0
' on the surface , many find the two as incongruent , ' said @entity121 to @entity212			0
' and i think it ’s very topical and a popular subject matter as we live in an overtly @entity1 nation and @entity71 ( @entity71 ) is the fastest rising sport			0
' the overlap between those makes a really interesting subculture to observe			0
controversially , children are encouraged to fight each other as part of evangelical martial arts programs overcome by the pain of losing , one little boy begins to cry after his physically draining fight ' there are many in the film giving interpretations of the @entity233			1
' but one thing you can say emphatically and without question , is that , nowhere does it outlaw @entity71			0
' therefore religion is such that everyone has their own interpretation ; sometimes a very passionate interpretation of whether or not it encompasses their lifestyle			0
' the people who inhabit this lifestyle , fight and are devout @entity245 believe that they are no contradictions there			2
for the fighters themselves , the competition is religious in itself			0
' the hope is that through the fight i can create a relationship with the person i 'm fighting and extend @entity52 to him , ' says one dedicated fighter .			2

painful *incident* filmed during making of ' @entity13 ' documentary
we ’ll just be a couple of @entity45 - *fearing* men punching each other in the face , ' one of the pastors explains
' fight churches ' featured in the film allow children to fight
