militants fighting for @entity1 in @entity2 have released a chilling new propaganda video in which a young @entity5 jihadi describes life fighting on the frontline			1
the unnamed man , who speaks with a southern @entity10 accent , is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside @entity15			1
wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle , the @entity1 militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a ' martyr ' , acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden and he must avoid being hit by the sniper rounds heard popping and cracking in the background			1
he is not thought to be fighting for the islamic state terror group , also known as @entity56			2
described as ' a short reminder from the blessed land of @entity60 ' , the propaganda footage is clearly designed to advertise the sacrifices @entity1 members are making in the name of their religion			2
the clip begins with a short burst of religious chanting before cutting to hd - footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the @entity1 - affiliated militants and soldiers fighting on behalf of the @entity2 regime			1
' it 's a foggy , cold day			0
the enemy is quite close and you can hear their shots coming - heavy machine gun fire , ' the jihadi says , as the crack and pop of @entity85 rounds ring out in the background			0
' that is fitnah of the head , ' he adds , using an @entity92 word meaning distress or mentally challenging			0
he adds that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and ' having to go natural ' due to the lack of toilet facilities , he considers it ' an honour to defend the @entity43 blood '			2
conflict : the clip begins with hd - footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the @entity1 militants and soldiers of the @entity2 regime heavily armed : wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle , the @entity1 militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a ' martyr ' , acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden professional : titled ' a moment in @entity45 : standing guard in the way of @entity48 ' , the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group , but it is understood the militant is a fighter for @entity53 the video is the first to be uploaded to a @entity126 account titled ' @entity127 in @entity128 ' , which suggests it may well be part of a series of @entity1 propaganda releases featuring the fighter			1
the use of high - definition cameras and the use of a @entity5 fighter apes the professionally shot and edited video releases by the @entity140 terror group - which have included the sickening filmed beheadings of several @entity144 hostages , including two @entity5			2
in the @entity1 release , the militant is seen standing up in the trench , saying ' from time to time you have to keep peering up			1
the only problem is if you stick your head up for too long , a sniper can take your head out '			0
' of course we all want shahada [ martyrdom ] but we ca n't be reckless about these things			0
if it comes it comes but the priority of the mujahideen is to protect his life and stand guard , ' he adds			2
the militant goes on to add that ' while villages and towns in that direction live their ordinary lives , we are here on the frontline , the @entity171 [ thanks be to @entity173 ] '			2
one of at least four airmen captured by @entity1 militants after their @entity2 @entity176 helicopter crash - landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric			1
the pilot , who was captured near @entity182 in @entity184 province , is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi @entity188 rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle			0
@entity192 , who has long been affiliated with @entity1 - linked groups in @entity2 , suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the @entity2 regime releases notorious jihadi @entity197 as - @entity198 , who is wanted in @entity199 for suspected links to the 1985 @entity201 and 2004 @entity203 bombings			1
fear : the captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi @entity188 rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle the video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of @entity1 's @entity2 affiliate @entity53 behind him			1
clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash , the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head			0
the footage is decidedly amateur , is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick , professionally edited videos put out by @entity229 's rival jihadi group @entity140			0
nevertheless , the sight of @entity192 standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any @entity56 release			0
' technical malfunction ' : people gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to @entity2 regime forces that crashed in @entity182 yesterday @entity192 's primary demand is that the @entity2 regime release @entity197 as - @entity198 - a notorious @entity1 linked militant who was arrested in @entity240 in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland			1
@entity244 - born as - @entity198 - who holds @entity199 citizenship remains a wanted man in @entity199 on suspicion of taking part in the @entity249 's 1985 bombing at @entity203 's @entity201 restaurant , which left 18 dead			0
he is also wanted as a possible witness to the @entity1 - inspired coordinated bombings on the @entity203 's train system , which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in march 2004 .			0
