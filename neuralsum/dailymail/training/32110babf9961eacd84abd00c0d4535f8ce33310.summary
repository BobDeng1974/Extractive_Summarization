by @entity1 reporter published : 08:35 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 28 august 2013 the plane in which seven @entity5 died en route to @entity7 may have crashed because it hit a bird just after take - off , when it was already struggling due to being overloaded , a report into the crash has concluded			1
the twin - engine propeller plane crashed shortly after take - off near @entity12 's capital , @entity13 , last september			1
among the seven @entity5 victims were @entity15 , 58 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , 57 , from @entity18 , and brothers @entity19 and @entity21 , aged 50 and 45 , from @entity22 , near @entity23			1
overloaded ? : the picture of rucksacks and personal belongings found at the wreckage site in @entity12 victims : @entity30 , pictured left with his wife @entity32 , and @entity33 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity34 , were both killed in the plane crash that killed 19 people fireball : firefighters battle to douse the burning wreckage of a plane which crashed on the edge of the @entity12 capital , killing 19 people including seven @entity5 the plane lost power and slowed down at a crucial point during take - off but investigators were unable to find why this happened			1
it meant the plane was not high enough to recover when it went off course			2
the report also records that while preparing for take - off , the pilot twice noticed a bird and as the plane accelerated , he said ' watch out for the bird '			2
the first officer reported being clear of it as he accelerated but the crew later reported a bird strike			2
however , no evidence of it was found in the engine			0
investigators said : ' it is possible that the bird momentarily disturbed the air flow into the engine before it was struck by the propeller , causing a surge and the suspected flame seen in the @entity73 footage , but the engine manufacturer considered this unlikely			0
' if the flame seen in the @entity73 and accompanying " bang " heard on the @entity77 were evidence of an engine surge , then another possible cause is a fuel flow problem			0
' as the plane turned , it lost power and began to descend , before suddenly hitting the ground just 420 metres from the runway			2
the report says one engine failed and the other suffered a power loss			0
tragic deaths : @entity5 @entity15 , left , and @entity17 , right , were both killed in the crash destroyed : the fire quickly spread to the rear of the plane , but the tail was still in one piece at the scene near the @entity98 on the south - west edge of @entity13 the engine was also operating at low power			1
it said : ' there was no evidence to suggest that the flight crew recognised that a power loss had occurred on the ground , possibly because it occurred gradually and progressively rather than instantaneously			0
this would account for why the takeoff was continued			0
' they concluded there was no evidence of a bird in the engine , both engines were low on power and when speed fell , there was no power to accelerate			0
it added : ' the investigation was unable to determine the cause of the thrust reduction			0
' five @entity124 also died , as well as three passengers and four crew members from @entity12			1
the tragedy had been blamed simply on the plane striking a bird of prey at a height of 50ft as it took off from @entity132 in the @entity12 capital heading for @entity134 near @entity7			1
but experts doubted whether that alone would have prevented the pilot from bringing the @entity138 back around for an emergency landing at the airport			0
@entity142 government aviation minister @entity141 said that the combined weight of passengers and luggage carried by the plane would play a key part in the inquiry , which @entity5 investigators from the @entity150 assisted with			1

’ and @entity166 , an experienced pilot with the @entity167 said : ‘ a bird hitting the plane should not be considered in isolation during the investigation			0
traveller : @entity173 , 51 , from @entity174 in @entity175 , died in the crash ‘ several factors , such as technical maintenance , load , pressure on airline operators and many more , lead to an air crash			2
’ all those on board – including 12 people from @entity12 and @entity124 – died in the inferno when the twin - prop aircraft ploughed into a riverbank minutes after take off			1
