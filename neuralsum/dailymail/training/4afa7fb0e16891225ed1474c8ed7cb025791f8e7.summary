by @entity0 what we were told last year was happening to @entity3 may be happening now			1
we were informed that he was maturing before our eyes , when , in fact , he was plastering himself in tattoos and ostentatiously taking his dog for a walk along the paddock			0
it was partly a fabrication of the @entity13 pr machine to portray him in this way			1
for one thing , @entity13 could not accurately estimate whether he was maturing or not			1
he had just joined the team			0
improved : @entity3 has won the last three races and is well primed for a proper title challenge so while they solemnly told us that he was more contented , more rounded , more relaxed than ever , some of us thought he was on a voyage of discovery			1
he was finding his way , having been set free from the confines of his father ’s instruction and @entity13 ’ guiding control			1
in order to give him the space , @entity13 were laissez - faire			1
it may well have been a prudent approach to show him love and then , that fundamental bond being established , exercise some hold over him			2
that is what they have done in stopping him travelling around the world with his dogs , @entity47 and @entity48			1
it was evidently absurd for a serious sportsman to parade his bulldogs at work			0
it was a distraction for him , it was bad for their ears and a pain for those who wiped up after them ( a job that should , surely , have been carried out by the owner or staff specifically engaged by him for the purpose )			0
it is said that @entity68 , the @entity13 boss , is behind the move to confine @entity3 ’s pets to home – or kennels , or whatever millionaires do with dogs they leave behind			1
rooting for @entity3 : @entity75 looks on during @entity77 testing in @entity78 in april @entity68 ’s view is in accordance with every serious commentator in the sport			1
take @entity84 ’s words to @entity85			2
he said : ‘ i have the utmost respect and admiration for @entity3 , but the @entity77 paddock is no place for a dog			2
' think of the safety reasons			0
think , too , of how a dog ’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human ’s – and my hearing has been destroyed by @entity77 cars			2
' i am utterly amazed he ’s allowed to take the dog in			2
whoever said that was ok should be drummed out of the @entity102			0
i ca n’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about			0
' @entity108 has prevailed in the end			0
@entity110 : @entity3 brought his dog @entity47 into the paddock regularly last season where was dr @entity115 , the renowned psychiatrist , as @entity116 crumpled from 3 - 0 up to draw 3 - 3 at @entity117 on monday night ? in @entity119 ’s @entity118 watching another of his charges , @entity122 , lose the world championship snooker final to the more mentally robust @entity124			1
the backside was somewhat falling out of the mind - bending business , it seemed			0
this impression was reinforced by @entity3 ’s welcome comments that he perceives no advantage in engaging such services			1
mind games : @entity3 says he sees no advantage in using a psychiatrist such as dr @entity115 ( right ) ‘ never , ' he said when asked if such as dr @entity136 , a psychologist engaged by his @entity13 team in @entity138 three weeks ago , would be working with him			1
‘ @entity139 needed one and will never have one			0
so we ’ll never speak of it again unless i start going crazy			0
’ my feeling based on conversations with some of the leading sportsmen of the age is that @entity3 speaks for the majority of them			1
they see no need for some ‘ shrink ’ to improve their well - tuned , ultra-competitive minds			0
i do not decry those who have turned to @entity115 and his ilk			0
@entity156 and @entity157 , for two , swear by him			0
i am just saying – indeed , @entity3 is hinting at the fact – that for most sportsmen their advice is unnecessary			2
@entity164 , the @entity165 test driver , aka the world ’s fastest woman , appears not to be doing her status as an equal - opportunities employee much good in her casting at the football match played annually before the @entity171 @entity170			1
to see what i mean case your eyes a long way down the list ... tag : @entity164 may not be doing her status as an equal - opportunities employee too much good			2

*mercedes* have exercised some hold over @entity3 ... by stopping him travelling around the world with his dogs
@entity3 has won his last three races , and looks good for a title challenge
it is thought @entity68 , the @entity13 boss , is behind the move to confine @entity3 ’s pets to home
@entity3 also said he would never use a psychologist , and you get the feeling his thoughts are echoed in sport
