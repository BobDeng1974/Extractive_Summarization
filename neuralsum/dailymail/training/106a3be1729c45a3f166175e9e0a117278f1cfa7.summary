by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor senate minority leader @entity2 may suddenly be looking past his state 's @entity4 primary , after a tea party - linked conservative challenger was caught speaking at a pro-cockfighting rally on saturday			1
@entity9 is challenging @entity10 from the right , but his half - hour speech at the beginning of the rally has increased his statewide name - recognition in a way no politicians wants			1
cockfighting is an intensely controversial blood sport in which roosters ' claws are sharpened and fitted with razor - sharp ' spurs ' – and fight to the death while spectators bet on them			1
' @entity9 has no credibility left whatsoever , ' @entity10 's press secretary @entity26 told @entity28			1
' at this point nothing surprises us with this guy			0
' it was not a cockfighting rally , it was a states ' rights rally , ' @entity9 spokeswoman @entity55 told the @entity59			1
the pro-cockfighting group advertised its saturday event on its @entity63 page , however , as a bid to organize ' a grassroots movement to legally protect gamefowl enthusiasts			2
' on thursday the conservative businessman appeared on the @entity69 radio show in @entity70 , seemingly abandoning the @entity72 - did n't - know defense			0
' it 's interesting , ' he said			0
' when you look at cockfighting and dogfighting as well , this is n't something new			2
it was n't invented in @entity38 , for example			2
' ' i mean , the @entity81 were all – many of them – very actively involved in this and always have been			0
' broadcast media have had a field day with @entity9			0
' cockfighting is illegal in all 50 states , and is illegal in 41 , ' a shocked @entity87 said thursday on @entity92 's ' @entity91 ' program			1
' it 's also really sick			0
' @entity10 will have an easier time in the @entity4 primary against an opponent who is now linked to the illegal practice			0
but in november he will need every vote he can muster against @entity38 attorney general @entity99 , a @entity100 with whom he 's running neck - and - neck			2
the scenario of a razor - thin margin in the general election could make even cockfighters ' votes critical			0
@entity108 , president of the @entity109 , told the @entity110 in february that his group could swing as many as 60,000 voters toward @entity10 – or tell them to stay home on @entity114			0
@entity10 ( c ) leads @entity9 , his tea party challenger , but will face a tougher fight in the general election , making every vote -- even those of cockfighters -- critical ; the lobby is furious with the senator for approving a @entity123 that mad it a federal crime to attend an animal fight vicious : before a cockfight , birds ' claws are sharpened and ' spurs ' -- pointed puncture - weapons -- are attached to their legs in order to make their attacks more lethal in the ring tradition ? the @entity136 still proudly cheers on sports teams whose mascot is the ' @entity141 ' cockfighting is illegal in all 50 states , but @entity38 is one of nine states where it 's not a felony			1
penalties there for participating can include one year in jail after a @entity152 misdemeanor conviction			0
spectators can expect only modest fines			0
but the 2014 federal farm bill , which @entity10 supported , added time behind bars for merely attending a cockfight anywhere in the @entity1 animal fight spectators can now land in federal prison for up to one year			1
' knowingly ' bringing a child under 16 to any such event is now a federal felony that carries a penalty of up to three years			1
' this will destroy @entity2 in @entity38 , ' @entity108 said in february after president @entity165 signed the bill into law			1
the lobbying arm of the @entity169 , the nation 's wealthiest animal rights group , is calling for @entity9 to abandon his campaign			1
he ' showed appalling judgment in associating himself with this band of lawbreakers and perpetrators of unspeakable animal cruelty , ' @entity173 president @entity172 wrote on his blog			0
' he ’s brought discredit upon the state of @entity38 , and he should withdraw from the @entity34 race			0
' fighting roosters are kept in dozens of states for underground matches , even though the practice is illegal in every state ; @entity38 is one of just nine states that have not made participating in a cockfight a felony @entity38 has a thriving community of cockfighting enthusiasts who insist that their hobby should be legal , and gather often -- in open meetings like this one in @entity196 , @entity38 -- to show strength in numbers and pressure legislators @entity201 president @entity108 said in february that sen. @entity2 's vote in favor of a @entity123 that turned attending a cockfight into a federal crime will ' destroy ' him in @entity38 @entity172 is himself a controversial figure			1
in 2009 a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the ringling brothers circus , saying among other things that @entity172 's group – then called the fund for animals – paid thousands of dollars to the star witness in the case			2
the judge ultimately ruled that the witness was ' a paid plaintiff			0
' the @entity169 has an image problem in @entity38 as well , since it raises tens of millions of dollars every year with ads suggesting it 's related to local ' humane society ' shelters , but spends much of that money advocating for vegetarianism and other positions that make livestock farmers bristle			2
@entity55 , @entity9 's spokeswoman , did not respond to a message requesting comment			2
@entity10 has hammered his tea party opponent in ads focusing on his 2008 defense of the federal government 's unpopular $ 700 billion @entity235 bailouts of @entity238 investment firms			1
' @entity9 will say whatever he thinks people want to hear in the moment to try and make a quick sale , ' @entity26 , the @entity10 spokeswoman , told @entity28			0
he ' claims to be a conservative business man but takes taxpayer funded bailouts for his uninsured business and supported @entity235 , ' she said , ' claimed to have an mba from @entity248 when he never even attended the school , and now he claims he did n't know he was giving a speech to cockfighters at a cockfighting rally			1

cockfighting is illegal in all 50 states , a felony in 41 , and a class a misdemeanor in @entity38
the federal farm bill includes a *provision* making attending a cockfight and bringing a child to one a federal crime involving a prison term
@entity38 's organization supporting the blood sport wants senate minority leader @entity2 to oppose the legislation
@entity9 , his tea party challenger , spoke at the group 's rally on saturday
he *initially* claimed he did n't know what kind of event it was , but later defended himself by claiming @entity1 's founding fathers were cockfighters
