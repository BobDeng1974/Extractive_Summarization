by @entity0 a man who swallowed a live goldfish in @entity4 's as part of a sick drinking game has been banned from keeping animals			1
@entity7 , 20 , was filmed buying a goldfish , taking it to the fast food outlet in @entity11 , @entity12 , dropping it into a pint of beer and downing the drink			1
after finishing the beer he proclaimed ' i 'm an animal '			1
the video was later uploaded to @entity20 as part of the @entity23 craze , in which people challenge one another to down bizarre , and in some cases lethal , alcoholic concoctions on camera			2
the pair both admitted cruelty charges at @entity41 yesterday			1
at the start of the cruel prank , @entity7 and @entity37 visit a @entity44 and buy the fish while boasting to a shop assistant about their plan			1
@entity7 said : ' i 'm going to call him @entity50			2
i want a nice big one , we are going to eat it			0
i 'll buy some chips with it			0
' the two then head to @entity4 's and drop the fish into a plastic cup of beer			1
@entity7 announces : ' thanks for the @entity60 , this is a goldfish in beer			1
' he adds : ' that trick usually works better when i 've got my rabbit			0
' after swallowing the fish he says : ' i 'm an animal '			2
' @entity65 ' : @entity7 , left , and @entity37 , right , were both criticised by the judge , who said they ' still find ' the video funny the pair was prosecuted by the @entity36 , which received reports of the cruel video from concerned viewers who saw it on @entity20 in february this year			1
@entity7 admitted the charge of inflicting unnecessary harm to a protected animal , while @entity37 , admitted the aiding and abetting of cruelty			1
in court yesterday the pair was given a three - year ban on keeping animals , and hit with more than £ 1,500 in fines , as the judge branded the dare ' simply sick humour '			1
prosecutor @entity88 , for the @entity36 , told the court : ' the video speaks for itself			1
' describing the @entity23 craze to the judge , mr @entity88 added : ' this type of challenge is well - known			0
it 's a dare filmed and broadcasted for other people 's entertainment			1
' the craze took off in february this year , but quickly turned dark after three men died shortly after filming themselves drinking especially potent concoctions consisting of up to a pint of spirits such as gin and vodka			2
defence lawyer @entity105 told the court his clients had n't known they were committing an offence when they made the video			2
pleased with himself : @entity7 can be seen giggling before starting the dare juvenile : the @entity23 craze began this year , spawning bizarre and sometimes dangerous online videos plan : @entity7 said he made the video because he knew it would be popular			1
he was prosecuted by the @entity36 after online viewers reported the abuse sentencing them , district judge @entity119 told the pair : ' you might say this fish only met the sort of death it would have in the wild			1
you might say : " well it 's only a goldfish "			2
' both of those notions miss the point			0
apart from anything else , the more defenceless an animal is , the more culpable the abuse is of it			0
' it may not be obvious that fish have the same feelings that a dog or cat has , but that does not mean that they are incapable of experiencing pain and it 's certainly no justification for treating them like that			2
' that creature died a deeply painful and wholly unpleasant death			0
' the judge added : ' this was plainly planned to some degree and clearly deliberate			0
you filmed what happened and put it on a social media site			0
the further aggravating feature is that you both found it so funny , and still find it funny now			0
that is quite simply sick humour			0
' @entity7 and @entity37 were ordered to serve 40 hours of unpaid work and pay a £ 723 fine each , alongside a victim surcharge of £ 60			1
speaking outside court , @entity37 said : ' i was shocked when i got the call from the @entity36			1
i did n't think it was a big issue with it being a small animal			0
i 'm an animal lover myself and i did n't know i was committing an offence			0
' i have thousands of followers on social media , and i posted the video because i knew it would go viral			0
some people thought it was funny but there were a few who thought it was cruel			0
i did later decide to delete the video			0
' @entity36 spokeswoman @entity178 said : ' it 's a horrible thing to do to a living animal , and i 'm pleased that the courts have taken the same view			1
' i hope that the sentence that 's been handed down to the defendants acts as a deterrent and prevents this from happening again in future			0
the district judge was absolutely right			0
' they showed a blatant disregard for that animal 's life and welfare			2

@entity7 , 20 , bought fish from *pet* store then downed it with beer
filmed by friend @entity37 , 19 , at @entity202 in @entity11 , @entity12
