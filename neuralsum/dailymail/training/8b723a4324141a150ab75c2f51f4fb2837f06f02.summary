@entity0 , 25 , dropped from 20st to 13st after gastric surgery the mother took action as she was so large so could n't do activities with her son , aged seven , or even give him a cuddle by @entity7 published : 06:02 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 13:34 est , 7 september 2012 a mother who could n’t cuddle her son because she was so overweight has dropped six dress sizes after undergoing gastric surgery			1
@entity0 , 25 , tipped the scales at 20st and was so large her young son , @entity12 , was unable to wrap his arms around her for a hug			1
her size also affected the time she spent with @entity12 as she felt unable to join him doing activities like swimming and going to the fun - fair			2
as she was : @entity0 , 25 , weighed 20 stone and was so big her son @entity12 could n't put his arms around her for a hug she said : ' @entity12 loves swimming but the idea of putting a swimming costume on was too daunting so we never went			1
i spent my days on the sofa , reading magazines and eating instead			0
' i wanted to be the best mum i could be , but i could n’t even take him to the fun - fair because i was scared i would n’t fit on the rides			0
' @entity0 , from @entity34 in @entity35 , started to gain weight after splitting from @entity12 ’s father not long after giving birth to her son , now seven			1
she started comfort eating , tucking into a large bowl of cereal and two slices of buttered toast every day for breakfast			2
slimmed down : @entity0 is now a dress size 14 after losing 7st following gastric surgery			1
she loves her new shape and how she can now fit into pretty dresses lunch was two @entity51 pasties with crisps or a large @entity54 ’s meal , all washed down with a large fizzy drink			2
while at dinnertime she would order a large chicken curry with chips , spring rolls and prawn crackers from her local @entity62 takeaway			2
indulging her sweet tooth , @entity0 would often snack on crisps and chocolate between meals			1
as the weight crept on , @entity0 ’s self - confidence ebbed away			1
' i used to burst into tears in changing rooms because everything looked terrible on me , ' she said			0
@entity75 risk : the mother knew she had to do something about her weight after she developed diabetes and it was n't just finding clothes to fit her dress size 26 that was a problem			1
at nearly 20st , her health deteriorated and she was diagnosed with diabetes			0
' i started to worry that i would lose limbs because of my diabetes , or that i would contract heart disease			0
i did n’t want to jeapordise my health , i wanted to be able to run around after my little boy , ' she said			0
so in march this year @entity0 went under the knife and had gastric surgery , which reduced the size of her stomach by three - quarters and limited how much she can eat			1
just six months after the surgery she slimmed down from a size 26 to a size 14 and dropped more than a third of her body weight - losing seven stone			2
comfort eater : @entity0 used to binge on takeaways and pasties but knew she had to change her lifestyle so she could be a more active and healthy mum to her son she now weighs 12st 7lbs and said she has never felt better			1
she said : ' i ’ve got so much more confidence and self esteem			0
i ’ve got a million times more energy and can be the mum i ’ve always wanted to be			0
' i now take him swimming and we go on bike rides and for walks on the beach			0
best of all i can have proper cuddles with my son now , because he can finally wrap his little arms around me			0
it ’s the best feeling in the world			0
