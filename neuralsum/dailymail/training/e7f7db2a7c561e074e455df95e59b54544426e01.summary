by @entity0 last updated at 11:05 pm on 28th december 2011 for most of us , the only recycling this @entity1 involved large piles of wrapping paper			2
but the @entity6 took things to a whole new level by re-using many of its biggest @entity1 shows days – and in some cases , hours – after they first aired			2
viewers were shocked to see shows such as @entity14 and @entity15 , which aired on christmas day , reappear on @entity16 on @entity17			1
repeat : the @entity18 , pictured , was aired on both @entity19 and @entity17 the festive episode of @entity22 was not far behind as viewers were hit with it for a second time , just two days after it premiered on december 25			1
the @entity27 episode of @entity28 was on again on @entity17 and another hotly anticipated @entity19 show , absolutely fabulous , will be screened tonight			1
even one of the biggest films was being given a second outing – @entity33 : @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 , which aired on @entity16 on @entity27 , is on @entity37 tomorrow night			2
was this the worst @entity1 ever on the @entity6 ? @entity38 gave shows such as @entity40 : @entity41 and the @entity42 more than one showing , and the @entity19 special of @entity45 will be screened again on @entity46			1
but viewers singled out the @entity6 for recycling so much of their new output over the festive period			0
as well as its big @entity19 shows , the corporation also aired cookery shows the @entity53 ’ @entity19 , @entity54 ’s @entity1 and @entity56 ’s @entity55 only 15 hours after their first slot			2
viewers have also complained that this year ’s festive line - up was one of the worst in recent memory			0
shows such as the return of @entity64 did not live up to many people ’s expectations and the new sir @entity68 comedy was another disappointment			0
as well , the @entity45 special on @entity19 did not get the huge ratings many were expecting			1
one viewer wrote on the @entity6 ’s message board : ‘ what ’s with all the repeats ? on @entity17 you repeated @entity14 from christmas day , @entity28 from @entity27 , not to mention the numerous repeats of the @entity78			1
‘ there is no need to repeat programmes now as most people have access to a digital recorder … ca n’t you spend the licence fee on some new programmes instead			0
’ a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ we never repeat prime - time shows in the same slot			0
‘ this @entity1 has seen brand new shows in drama , factual , entertainment and religion			0
‘ over 91 per cent of programming on peak - time on @entity16 is brand new and has never been shown before			0

@entity14 and @entity15 aired on both @entity19 and @entity17
@entity38 follows suit as christmas day special of @entity45 will be screened again on @entity46
