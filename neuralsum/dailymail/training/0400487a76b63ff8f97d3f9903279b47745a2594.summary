by @entity0 @entity2 's new breakfast show @entity3 fronted by @entity4 could face the chop after just one month on air following a ratings slump			1
since it launched to a grand fanfare at the end of april , ratings have plummeted as viewers continue to tune in to @entity14 's former show @entity15			1
for the past fortnight the programme has failed to reach the 15 per cent of the audience share bosses reportedly said it needed to survive , and the show is being watched by fewer people than flop @entity21 - which it was brought in to replace			1
during @entity3 's launch week , the @entity2 show had an average of about 690,000 viewers , while @entity15 maintained a steady 1.5million			2
however , last monday just 270,000 viewers watched the show , according to @entity45 , and despite it being a @entity48 , 1.17 million people still tuned into the @entity15 rival - which had a 34.7 percent of the audience share , compared with @entity3 's 9.5 percent			1
a senior source at @entity2 admitted that the programme would be unable to continue , unless viewers returned			2
replacement : @entity3 's high profile launch came after its predecessor @entity21 , presented in its final months by @entity57 and @entity58 , was dropped for low audience figures rival : @entity4 left @entity15 , here presented by @entity61 and @entity62 , earlier this year			1
the @entity15 show regularly pulls in average viewing figures of more than one million ' no - one is expecting to beat the @entity15 and no - one is expecting to get over a million viewers , ' the source told @entity45 's @entity69			1
' but we do want it to get above 15 percent - or it is toast			0
' @entity3 's high profile launch came after its predecessor @entity21 was dropped for low audience figures			0
between its debut to may 28 @entity3 attracted an average audience of 584,200 , 15.2 percent of the audience share , compared with @entity21 's average of 673,800 , or 16.6 percent , during the same period last year			1
in the months before it was axed @entity21 was attracting an average of around 600,000 viewers			0
launch : during @entity3 's launch week , the @entity2 show had an average of about 690,000 viewers , while @entity15 maintained a steady 1.5million the source suggested that @entity3 , introduced by @entity2 's director of television @entity87 , could continue for the next six months to avoid embarrassment for bosses at the channel			2
however , following @entity21 the broadcaster could be tempted to do away with a breakfast show completely , and return to showing children 's programmes every morning			0
an @entity2 spokesman told @entity97 that there are ' absolutely no plans to axe @entity3 ' , and programme makers are in for ' the long game '			1
@entity3 ( 28 april – 28 may 2014 ) average number of viewers : 584,200 audience share : 15.2 percent @entity21 ( 28 april – 28 may 2013 ) average number of viewers : 673,800 audience share : 16.6 percent @entity15 ( 28 april – 28 may 2014 ) average number of viewers : 1.49million audience share : 36.78 percent @entity15 ( 28 april – 28 may 2013 ) average number of viewers : 1.49m audience share : 34.75 percent @entity14 , whose profile increased hugely late last year in the wake of her appearances on last year ’s @entity114 , is joined on the weekday show by @entity27 - a familiar face for @entity2 breakfast viewers from his @entity118 days , as well as @entity28 and @entity26 - who were both poached from @entity119			1
the four presenters appear on screen at the same time			0
for viewers , one of the biggest changes to predecessor @entity21 - along with the presenting team - was the introduction of a glass desk at which the hosts were seated for much of the show , although they moved to sofas later			2
many observers have interpreted the discussions around the desk as more of a @entity135 - style approach , taking its cue from @entity139 ’s popular @entity138			0
but viewers were divided on the show , with some lamenting the passing of its predecessor while others praised its fast pace and gloss			0
ms @entity4 ’s @entity2 debut initially drew mixed reactions , with criticism that the show looked too similar to its @entity135 counterpart and that ms @entity4 ’s figure were obscured by a desk			2
as the show began viewers took to @entity157 to complain that the legs of the 43 - year - old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £ 400,000 and as much as £ 1million a year - were hidden from view			0
one viewer commented : ' why has @entity2 paid so much for @ susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk ? its like buying a @entity166 and keeping it in the garage # gmb			0
' another wrote : ' you do n't hire @entity4 and then stick her behind a desk # getyourpinsout # @entity171			0

for the past fortnight the show has failed to reach audience share of 15 *%*
