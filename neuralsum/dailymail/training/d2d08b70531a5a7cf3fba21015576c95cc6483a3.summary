the federal government is using a legal process called ' civil forfeiture ' to seize massive amounts of money from unsuspecting @entity5 – without alleging that they 've committed any crimes			1
laws put on the books to help the government track drug trafficking proceeds and terrorists ' cash reserves are regularly contorted , according to a civil rights group , by prosecutors who see easy access to piles of cash that ultimately pays their salaries			1
the financial seizures leave some honest small businessmen and women out of luck when their life savings disappear and their family trades teeter on the edge of insolvency			1
in one case , the @entity27 took $ 446,000 from a mostly cash - only small business that distributes candy , snacks and cigarettes to convenience stores			1
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 lost that money two years ago when the federal government raided their bank account			1
in another , the government grabbed $ 33,000 from @entity43 restaurateur @entity42 , who deals only in cash			1
no criminal charges have been brought in either case			0
' i was unable to pay my bills for the first time in my life			2
i had to borrow money , use my credit cards and beg vendors to extend me credit			2
this nightmare has left me broke , frightened and exhausted			0
' the @entity77 , a nonprofit legal organization , is representing hinders and the @entity36 family			1
the @entity80 interviewed @entity81 , a former federal prosecutor who is now a forfeiture expert			2
' they 're going after people who are really not criminals , ' @entity81 said			2
' they 're middle - class citizens who have never had any trouble with the law			1
' @entity77 attorney @entity89 told @entity90 that ' civil forfeiture is a nationwide scandal			2
... it 's one of the most significant threats to private property in the country			0
' ' the bottom line is that these harsh civil forfeiture laws were aimed at serious criminals			2
nobody expected them to be used against people for depositing their own money in their own bank accounts			1
' equally troubling , he said , is that the laundry list of federal agencies that take @entity5 ' property on a regular basis can keep it – pocketing cash and selling other assets – in order to pay salaries and grow their budgets for the next round of seizures			1
while they ultimately refer criminal cases to the @entity5 @entity120 for prosecution , forfeited assets stay with the investigating agencies			0
@entity89 would n't comment on the personalities involved , but said the conflict of interest made his job harder			0
' prying this power away from government agencies is always met with resistance , ' he said			0
' they are benefiting directly financially from these forfeitures and that 's a major part of the problem			0
' after the @entity80 inquired with the @entity27 , the agency said it would soon pare back its efforts at targeting money belonging to law - abiding citizens			1
its investigators will instead focus on funds they believe were ill - gotten or fall into unspecified ' exceptional circumstances			0
' but past seizures will not be resolved any differently			0
@entity144 chief @entity143 said in a statement to the @entity80 that the ' policy update ' will help his unit ' focus our limited investigative resources on identifying and investigating violations within our jurisdiction that closely align with @entity154 's mission and key priorities			0
' ' i did not do anything wrong , but they took my money , ' hinders said			0
' this nightmare has left me broke , frightened and exhausted ' court papers : hinders had the rare courtesy of a court order for her cash , but she has n't been granted a hearing and wo n't see a judge until june 2015 – two years after her money was snatched @entity171 , the @entity173 ' 27 - year - old business , regularly makes large cash bank deposits			1
so does mrs. @entity176 's @entity175 , the lunch spot that @entity49 operates			0
but it 's the amounts of those deposits that caught the @entity27 's attention			1
banks are required to report cash transactions of $ 10,000 or more , so a common practice among drug traffickers and other criminals is to keep deposits in the four - figure range			1
the feds sometimes flag a repeated pattern of deposits near but less than $ 10,000 as ' structured ' payments – and there 's a federal law against it			1
but no one has accused either business of violating it , or any other law			2
neither forfeiture was preceded by a warning of any kind			0
@entity143 insists that depositing amounts less than $ 10,000 in order to evade reporting laws is still a crime , even if the funds were earned legally			1
some taxpayers , an @entity27 official told mailonline monday , use series of small cash deposits to avoid income tax reporting			1
' the government is not going to lessen its attention on tax evasion , ' the official said , ' so scrutinizing cash depositors is always going to be part of our approach			0
' in the @entity222 ' case , the government never formally applied to a court for permission to take their cash			0
that 's a clear violation of the @entity227 , the @entity77 says			2
@entity228 passed that law in 2000 to curb abuses by prosecutors under forfeiture laws			2
' prosecutors in some offices spent years trying to undermine those reforms , ' said @entity89 , the @entity77 attorney			2
' this case would set an important precedent that greater due process is required in forfeiture cases than many prosecutors seem to believe			0
' ' besides , these people have a right to defend themselves			0
the government should n't take property under these laws from people who did nothing wrong and did n't even know that they were potentially breaking some obscure banking law			1
' hinders runs mrs. @entity176 's @entity175 in @entity251 , @entity43 , and accepts only cash and checks cash inventory : @entity255 , one of three brothers who own @entity171 on @entity257 is still out $ 446,000 as the government sits on the company 's cash and wo n't explain why @entity89 told @entity90 that the government typically drags its feet when challenged – or has to be dragged into court to explain itself			1
' civil forfeiture laws do not provide for any prompt hearing in front of a judge			0
they violate the basic notion of due process , ' he said			0
' the government can take this money and just sit on it , and try to force you into a settlement			2
which is what they 've done in this case and in others			0
' in the @entity43 case , the @entity80 reported monday that @entity49 got a knock on her door last year from two federal agents who told her that her checking account had been seized			1
' how can this happen ? ' she asked the @entity80			0
' who takes your money before they prove that you 've done anything wrong with it ? ' hinders wo n't see a judge until at least may 2015 , since she 's not entitled to a preliminary hearing where a judge might conclude the @entity27 had no justification to take her earnings			1
' we 're just saying the government should have to show it has probable cause to hold that money , ' @entity89 said			0
' why not give a prompt post-seizure hearing to make sure the government does n't have the facts wrong ? ' is the government trying to use civil forfeiture to take your cash , car or home even though you have n't broken any laws ? the @entity77 is collecting horror stories and planning legal responses			1

agencies that seize the cash can keep it to pay salaries and grow their budgets
feds seized $ 446,000 from @entity328 candy and cigarette distributor that deals mostly in cash ; @entity43 grandma lost $ 33,000 from her restaurant business
@entity334 can take money if it thinks people are evading financial reporting laws by depositing money in specific amounts
deposits of $ 10,000 or more *trigger* bank reporting requirements , so drug *kingpins* , terrorists and *racketeers* often limit their deposits to $ *9,900*
law - abiding people can have their money seized ; @entity27 can sit on the cash and try to pressure ordinary businessmen and women into settlements
@entity77 , a nonprofit law firm , is pushing back and demanding hearings before federal judges
