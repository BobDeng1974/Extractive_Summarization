@entity9 police chief @entity12 told the website no one has yet come forward saying they witnessed an abduction			0
a suspicious vehicle , however , was described by one witness			2
' the witness was not aware of @entity5 ’s abduction until officers began their initial investigation , therefore , had no reason to believe the van was involved in a crime or to take additional actions , like call 911			2
' @entity12 also said that investigators believe the silver @entity40 mini-van spotted may still be involved			0
' based on the fact the driver has not been identified and the van ’s departure from the @entity8 store is within the timeline of @entity5 ’s disappearance , investigators still believe it may be involved , ' he said			1
the driver is reportedly a 6 - foot - tall white man , who may be between 30 and 40 years old			1
he has a medium to heavy build with broad shoulders and light brown or blond wavy hair with a center part , the website reports			2

@entity5 is also unlikely to have faked an abduction , @entity12 said -- since her blood was found at the scene as well as hundreds of dollars			1
' based on evidence obtained at the scene , including @entity5 ’s blood from the pavement outside of the store , the fact that hundreds of dollars in cash [ both @entity5 ’s and the store ’s ] was left behind and based on behavioral information we have developed during the investigation , it is highly unlikely that she is intentionally missing , ' @entity12 told @entity11			1

' former members of a task force that was formed to pursue the case after @entity5 vanished continue to work together , @entity12 said			0
