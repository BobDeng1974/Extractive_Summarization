more than a thousand years ago , a huge volcano straddling the border between @entity2 and @entity3 was the site of one of the biggest eruptions in human history , blanketing eastern @entity8 in its ash			1
but unlike other major volcanoes around the world , the remote and politically sensitive @entity10 remained almost a complete mystery to foreign scientists because they 've been barred from on - site studies - until now			1
two @entity17 scientists were given permission to study the mountain in an unprecedented joint project with @entity2 and now say they may soon be able to reveal some secrets of the volcano , including its likelihood of erupting again			1
for the crater good : clouds float over the peak of @entity28			0
@entity10 in @entity2 's @entity30 - it 's a volcano that @entity17 scientists have been granted permission to study to work out when it might erupt again feeling peaky : a @entity2 woman walks on the peak of @entity28			1
@entity10 they 're collecting seismic data and studying rocks ejected in @entity10 's ' millennium eruption ' sometime in the 10th century			2
' it 's one of the biggest eruptions in the last few thousands of years and we do n't have yet a historical date for it , ' @entity38 , a professor of volcanology at @entity40 , told @entity46 after returning to @entity47 last week from an eight - day trip to the volcano			1
' the rocks are a bit like the black box of a flight recording			0
there 's so much that we can read from the field site itself			0
' for volcano researchers , studying @entity10 is a golden opportunity to break new ground because so much about it remains a puzzle			2
@entity38 said it is not located along any of the tectonic locations that often explain volcanic activity , so just figuring out why it exists at all is one question that needs to be answered			0
little or no historical chronicles of the millennium eruption exist , so scientists are also interested in piecing together what exactly happened , what the volcano and the ecosystem around it were like before the eruption and how life returned afterward			2
@entity10 is considered sacred ground in both @entity3 and in @entity2 , where it is seen as a symbol of the ruling @entity79 family and of the revolution that led to the founding of the country , officially known as the @entity2			1
the fog clears : a @entity2 television station camera crew records the scenery from the peak of @entity28			0
@entity10 on the @entity2 side , the area around the mountain is dotted with ' revolutionary historical sites ' and secret camps from which @entity92 , @entity2 's first president , is said to have led guerrilla attacks against the @entity94 , who held the @entity96 as a colony until their 1945 surrender ended @entity99 tens of thousands of @entity2 visit the mountain for political indoctrination tours each year during the summer months , when the snows have melted enough for it to be accessible			1
@entity2 is also hoping to develop the volcano , which has a crystal blue crater lake , for foreign tourism			1
fears that the 2,800 - meter - tall ( 9,200 - foot ) volcano might be unstable began to grow in 2002 , when increased seismic activity and ground swelling suggested the magma below the volcano was shifting			0
that activity subsided in 2006			0
though not seen as a serious possibility by most experts , concerns were raised in @entity119 and @entity94 that nuclear tests in the @entity2 — conducted at a site which is less than 100 kilometers away — might trigger an eruption			0
' that activity sparked a lot of interest both in @entity3 and the @entity2 , but also in @entity94 and @entity119 and internationally , ' said @entity38 's colleague @entity125 , a seismologist at @entity126 in @entity127			2
he added that fears of another major eruption soon are probably unfounded			0
' it 's certainly very tranquil at the moment			0
' even so , @entity125 said the activity prompted the @entity2 government to reach out to the international scientific community for help in understanding @entity10 's inner workings			1
until the 2002 activity , little scientific research on the volcano had been conducted in @entity3 or @entity2			2
analysis : @entity125 , right , a seismologist at @entity126 in @entity127 , collects data from a seismometer on @entity10 the project got underway in 2011 at the request of a @entity146 , the @entity147			0
with funding from the @entity149 , a philanthropic organization based in @entity150 , that supports the sciences , @entity38 and @entity125 became the first westerners to visit the @entity2 's six field stations on the volcano			1
@entity125 said that although he was intrigued by the opportunity , the project was a logistical challenge , and not just because of language differences and @entity2 's unfamiliarity in dealing with foreign researchers			1
international sanctions on the @entity2 over its nuclear weapons program made it difficult for the scientists to bring in some of the equipment they wanted because of concerns they could have dual use applications that might benefit the @entity2 's military			1
' if we want to understand what the volcano is like today , we need to park instruments on the ground , ' @entity125 said			0
' building the models of what happened previously allows us to address what might happen in the future			0
' politically sensitive : @entity10 is considered sacred ground in both @entity3 and in @entity2 , where it is seen as a symbol of the ruling @entity79 family and of the revolution that led to the founding of the country			1
pictured is the current ruler - @entity186 friendly : @entity125 said that the @entity2 had been professional and co-operative he said that the @entity2 side has been cooperative and highly professional			2
@entity125 said that with their first year of data now complete , the scientists are hoping to begin the next stage of studying the data and samples in the laboratory and publishing papers on their findings with their @entity2 colleagues early next year			2
in september last year , @entity125 installed six broadband seismometers to record activity on the volcano , while @entity2 's @entity202 built protective huts for the equipment			1
he also collected samples of pumice that could provide insight into the scale of the millennium eruption , which is believed to have occurred between 930 and 940 a.d. @entity125 said their next trip is scheduled for next year and he hopes the project will continue beyond that			0

@entity17 scientists are the first westerners to study @entity10 in @entity2
it 's a volcano that last erupted around one thousand years ago
however , it 's been a complete mystery to foreign scientists - until now
a @entity17 team has been granted access to @entity10 to *unravel* its secrets
