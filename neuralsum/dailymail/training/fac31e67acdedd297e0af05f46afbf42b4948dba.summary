@entity1 's @entity0 delivers his verdict on the weekend 's @entity4 action			0
@entity5 was back to his best in @entity8 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity9 and made a few critics eat their words			1
elsewhere , @entity13 earned their first win of the season , @entity12 stormed to their fourth straight win as a @entity18 hat - trick saw them beat @entity19 4 - 2 at @entity20 and @entity21 were beaten by @entity22 at @entity23			1
@entity5 's back it was great to see @entity5 back to his best against @entity9			1
he did well against @entity27 , played ok for @entity28 , but on saturday he reminded us all what he can do			2
he played with a smile on his face , took the game by the scruff of the neck and was so composed for his goal			0
@entity37 wants to use him in a holding role but why waste his attacking talents ? he was at his best in the opposition half , as his heat map shows ( right )			0
he can play that deep role but it would be better for @entity28 if he played there every week			0
i was more than happy , too , for @entity5 to have a pop back at me after i criticised him recently			1
i did it as a player so know what it ’s like			0
but i ’m paid to give my opinions and he ’s paid to ram them down my throat			0
that ’s just what he did against @entity9			1
@entity5 celebrates his goal for @entity8 in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity9 at the @entity59 @entity5 chipped @entity60 to bring @entity8 level against @entity9 on saturday could @entity18 be the new @entity62 ? @entity18 has hit seven goals in four games , quicker than any @entity12 striker in recent times			1
@entity12 spent an awful lot of time and money trying to replace @entity62			1
it looks like they have finally found their man			0
what more can you say about @entity18 ? he has arrived in the @entity4 and is probably thinking : ‘ everyone is scared of me and i ’ve got @entity76 to supply the bullets			1
’ he must be absolutely loving it			0
he has seven goals in four games — it took @entity62 18 games to match that — and @entity18 is the complete package , scoring with both feet and his head			1
he is the real deal			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity22 's tactical masterclass @entity88 must love going to @entity23			1
the @entity22 boss has never lost a @entity4 game there as a manager , drawing once with @entity93 and now winning twice and drawing once with @entity22			1
the latest win was thoroughly deserved			2
they let the two centre backs have the ball , but as soon as @entity98 , @entity99 or @entity100 got it , @entity22 stopped them playing			1
it was the first time since december 2012 that @entity21 did n’t have @entity103 or @entity104 and it showed — they lacked a cutting edge up front			2
@entity22 were aggressive , @entity108 bullied @entity109 and the result showed what an astute tactician @entity88 is			2
@entity18 scored a hat - trick against @entity19 to help @entity12 to their fourth straight victory @entity18 has hit the ground running since moving to @entity12 , scoring seven goals in four games @entity118 scored the only goal as @entity22 stunned @entity21 at @entity23 next up for @entity120 : are diamonds forever ? it was an impressive attacking show from @entity13 at @entity123			1
that ’s only to be expected now with the embarrassment of riches they have in their squad			0
@entity13 went back to four in defence with a midfield diamond and looked much better for it			1
but will @entity132 stick with it ? @entity134 celebrates after scoring his first goal for @entity13 against @entity136 @entity132 finally earned his first win as @entity13 manager as they smashed @entity136 4 - 0 @entity140 happy to get goals on the board 1992 - @entity136 have not kept a clean sheet against @entity13 since 1992 — their first ever @entity4 meeting			1
i was in the @entity147 studio on sunday with @entity148 , who knows @entity140 better than anybody , and he is convinced @entity13 will end up with a back three			1
even with a four , @entity136 still created chances , and @entity13 will have tougher tests to come when they face the likes of @entity9 and @entity12			1
the system they did use looked good and @entity134 was exceptional , but i enjoyed watching @entity155			2
he was always involved , looked sharp and comfortable on the ball and used it well			0
he proved he ’s got an eye for goal , too , and provided plenty of sparkle in @entity13 ’s midfield diamond			2
stones can be a rock at the back injury might have ruled out @entity167 for @entity169 ’s 2 - 0 win at @entity170 , but he could find it hard to get himself back in the team			1
@entity173 and @entity174 have been stalwarts for @entity169 , but the team had conceded 10 goals in three games			1
with @entity180 coming in at centre back , they kept a clean sheet			1
the young man can play right back at a pinch but his long - term future is in the middle			2
he is comfortable in possession , has great recovery speed and now has a big season ahead of him			0
it could be time for a changing of the guard			0
young defender @entity180 gave another impressive performance for @entity169 at @entity170 @entity194 has @entity195 marching on when the likes of @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 left @entity195 for @entity23 , fans were worried about battling relegation			1
but it ’s been business as usual on the south coast and , though there ’s a long way to go , i ’m sure the @entity195 fans will be enjoying seeing their side above @entity21 in the table			2
@entity88 left but @entity194 has come in and already looks settled			0
he ’s played all over the place but he has good technique for a tall man and is linking up well with @entity214			0
you could n’t really call it a deliberate one - two for @entity194 ’s second , but they are forming a good partnership			2
@entity195 looked ready to implode at the start of the season but results have helped calm things down			0
i ’m sure there ’s a few more gems in the academy too — that place is a production line			0
@entity194 scored twice as @entity195 thrashed @entity229 4 - 0 at @entity230 's 34 - @entity231 have scored in 34 of their last 35 league games			1
the only fixture where they failed to find the net was @entity12 at @entity20 last month			2
@entity236 looking lively for @entity231 what a result for @entity231 and what a good start to his @entity4 career by @entity236			0
he cost big money from @entity242 , even at the age of 28 , but he has already impressed me			0
he looked a composed player against @entity8 and he was in such good form he probably did n’t want the international break to come round			0
but he picked up where he left off against @entity249 with the winner			0
he took it well , too , because the cross was slightly behind him so he had to adjust his feet quickly and finish from an awkward spot			0
there is good pace in @entity258 ’s team , and @entity259 will add some much - needed top - level experience			2
but so far this season , @entity236 has been their star performer			0
@entity236 scored the winner for @entity231 as they beat @entity249 1 - 0 at the @entity263 @entity0 's @entity4 number crunching 7 - it was not his best game in an @entity8 shirt , but @entity268 still produced the goods against @entity9			1
his pass set up @entity5 and @entity268 has been directly involved in seven @entity8 goals in his last eight league games , scoring four and assisting three			1
and , since the start of last season , no @entity8 player has provided more assists than the all - action midfielder — he has nine			2
2 - @entity22 did a fine job of making sure @entity21 were kept quiet			1
there were just two shots on target in the whole match at @entity23 , and the second of those came in the 11th minute			0
4 - @entity214 has kept up his creative form from last season			2
he has four assists in his last six league games for @entity288 and @entity195			2
5/36 - things do not look good for @entity290 and @entity229			0
of the last 36 league points on offer , his side have won just five			0
they have won one , drawn two and lost nine of their last 12 matches			0
@entity290 saw his @entity229 side thrashed 4 - 0 by @entity195 at @entity230 's on saturday @entity229 fans hold ' @entity302 ' banners as they make their feelings clear on the current manager 3 - despite angling for a move away , @entity305 is enjoying himself at @entity195			1
he already has three goals this season , one more than in the whole of last campaign			0
100th - it 's not one @entity311 will be proud of , but his own goal against @entity313 was the 100th @entity4 goal of the season			0
1 - @entity170 must sort out their home form if they want to stay in the @entity4			1
another home defeat , this time by @entity169 , means @entity318 ’s men have won just one of their last 11 home league games , drawing seven and losing three .			1

@entity18 has scored seven goals in just for games for @entity12
@entity5 was back to his best against @entity9
@entity22 deserved their 1 - 0 victory against @entity21 on saturday
@entity132 changed system against @entity136 and it worked well for @entity13
@entity180 could keep @entity167 out of the @entity169 team
