a growing school has relieved classroom pressure by turning a double - decker bus into a fully functioning teaching space			1
when headteacher @entity5 found there was no room in his primary school for extra lessons , he bought the bus on @entity11 , ripped out the old seats and replaced them with desks and a plasma tv screen			1
children at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , are now studying in the double - decker which accommodates around 15 pupils and took two months to renovate			1

the top level ( pictured ) can accommodate a dozen people the bus cost £ 5,000 to buy and another £ 3,000 to be refurbished into a suitable learning environment although the bus cost £ 5,000 and the transformation a further £ 3,000 , it has still worked out much cheaper than building an extension and mr @entity5 said his pupils love studying in the vehicle			1
mr @entity5 said : ' with the pupil premium we get from the government we can employ the staff but we did n't have any quiet areas to hold extra lessons			2
' we had literally turned toilets and cupboards into working spaces , and we started to look at the alternatives			0
' there are a number of tv programmes out there which have been really innovative with their use of space			0
' i have quite a lot of creative people around me and we thought , well you get double your money with a double - decker bus			1
' @entity60 , 6 , added : ' i was a bit nervous when i first got on the bus now i love it			0
we do lots of fun activities here			0
' mr @entity5 had looked into constructing a new build or renting porta cabins but said the cost of this ran into the hundreds of thousands			2
pupils boarding the bus in anticipation of a lesson aboard the unconventional classroom the bus was driven up from @entity75 earlier this year and was previously used to ferry festival goers around the @entity77 so earlier this year he came up with the novel idea of buying the bus and transforming it into a state of the art working space			1
the bus is a fully functioning classroom throughout the whole school day with lessons of up to 12 being held on the top deck and smaller groups of two or three downstairs			2
mr @entity5 said : ' some of the teachers were a bit unsure to begin with , but they have now completely come around to the idea			0
' the children absolutely love it			0
it is a novelty for them to come and take their lessons in the bus			0
' the bus was driven up from @entity75 earlier this year after it was bought by the school , which consists of around 550 pupils , and had previously been used to ferry around festival goers on the @entity77			1
the engine has now been decommissioned and it looks as though the vehicle , which dates back to the 1980s , is set to stay for good .			0
