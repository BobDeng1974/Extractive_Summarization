one woman told her husband she had been attacked with a knife , not divulging that she had also been raped , so great was her shame and distress			2
' it has been 22 long months since the incident happened to me ... i now suspect every male customer ... any small sudden motion by them will trigger me to think they are getting up to attack me			0

write caption here ' heroic ' : letters from victims of the former @entity2 lawyer @entity6 are read aloud during his sentencing , prompting the judge to comment that ' their strength is as formidable as their innocence is unsullied ' the woman said that she did not want to appear in court because in @entity149 culture , it would cause herself and her family more shame and embarrassment			1

in one instance , @entity6 followed a masseuse back to her car after receiving a massage and ordered her into the the vehicle before driving somewhere secluded and raping her in the back seat			2
in another , he returned to a business where he had previously tried to rape a masseuse and forced his way in when he was denied entry before raping the masseuse			0

' i read articles in the news and some reader 's comments that said these were " just @entity62 prostitutes			0
" then the defense lawyer said this was consensual sex and prostitution			0
it made me sick to my stomach ... [ to become a professional therapist ] i did everything that @entity187 requires here			0
i spent a lot of time and i worked very hard to complete school ... i am a good , moral woman and i strictly respect my career as a massage therapist and skin care professional , ' she wrote			1
the husband of one victim also wrote a statement , describing coming home to find his wife on the floor in the fetal position in the aftermath of the attack			0
lasting trauma : @entity6 targeted the women because he believed their language barrier and awe at his stature as well as shame and embarrassment would prevent them coming forward he was finally caught after raping a masseuse at knife - point at a @entity213 spa when the owner and others arrived as he was leaving			1
a struggle ensued and police found him two blocks away from the parlor			0
a victim wrote that she weeps in the middle of the night and can not bring herself to use a small knife in the kitchen because it looks similar to the knife @entity6 threatened her with			2

' ' although , the truth about what i did is dramatically different from what was alleged , i do not minimize my real wrongs and my apology for those particular wrongs is genuine and heartfelt , ' he said			0
