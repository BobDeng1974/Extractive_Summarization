@entity6 , 56 , had to be escorted off the 70mph @entity7 in @entity8 by police when worried motorists saw him crawling along the inside lane earlier this week			1
but the former soldier , who suffers from multiple sclerosis , said he has used the road before to travel from his home in @entity16 to @entity17 and was doing nothing illegal			1
' i was surprised when the young copper who seemed a bit baffled started checking it			0
' he checked the tyres and pointed out i did n’t have a speedometer but i do have tortoise and rabbit speed buttons			0
' he then took my number plates because he said they were actually for a @entity37 sports car			0
' i do have my wing mirror and i know it is not illegal for me to drive along the @entity7 in my scooter			1
it is only illegal on motorways - i have checked			1
' the father - of - two said when he was stopped by police while heading to @entity17 to take some photos because it was a nice day			2
raring to go : @entity6 says he is entitled to use his scooter on dual carriageways by law not backing down : former soldier mr @entity6 says he often travels along the @entity7 to get to @entity17 he added : ' i ’ve done it once before , and i was doing just fine until i saw all these flashing lights behind me - and that ’s when the trouble started			1
' there ’s no hard shoulder on that part of the @entity7 , so i was right on the white line and thought that would be ok			2
' i think the police caused more of a hold - up because they surrounded me with two vehicles to escort me off			0
' @entity8 police said mr @entity6 was given ' strong words of advice ' about the dangers of driving his mobility scooter along that particularly road			1
a spokesman said : ' the advice is not to use a mobility scooter on a dual carriageway if the speed limit is over 50mph			0
' a class 3 vehicle may be driven on a dual carriageway , but the advice is that they must have a flashing amber light			0
' the vehicle must also have front and rear lights and reflectors , direction indicators which are able to operate as a hazard warning signal and a rear view mirror			0
