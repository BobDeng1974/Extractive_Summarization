by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:44 pm on 11th january 2012 it may come across as an extreme case of nuptial nostalgia : a now - divorced man saying a photography studio should pay to recreate his wedding to make up for what he considers flawed pictures and video			1
never mind that the @entity12 's ex-wife has moved to her native @entity13 and has so far proved uncontactable			1

he claims the pictures and video were botched his comments released today are his first public response to a flurry of mocking commentary on the case he said it was about holding a business to a pledge , not holding onto a broken marriage			1
it was his first public response to a flurry of acidic commentary on the case in recent months			0
' it was their failure to deliver after a promise and a handshake ' agreement to retouch the photos , @entity14 said in a statement			2
' how could a business treat a customer this way ? ' while lawsuits over wedding photographs are n't unusual , what set @entity14 ' case apart is his mention of wanting to reconstitute the ceremony and celebration of a bygone union			2

the split was final in 2010 , and he said he believed his ex-wife had moved back to her native @entity13			1
nonetheless , ' i need to have the wedding recreated exactly as it was so that the remaining 15 per cent of the wedding that was not shot can be shot ' and the album and video completed ' so we have memories of the wedding , ' he said during his deposition			2
' so we would need to recreate everything to complete that			0

in a blunt statement , studio co-founder @entity96 wrote a letter to the court stating : ' the divorce renders the further demands for photos , etc. , ridiculous			1
' after @entity14 's remarks about recreating the wedding appeared in a story in the @entity108 in november , @entity104 ' quest became a punchline in quarters ranging from the legal blogosphere to the city 's tabloids			2
the @entity114 gave him a ' @entity115 ' ; @entity117 's @entity116 included @entity14 on his ' @entity118 '			2
he began sueing @entity119 in 2009 , saying the venerable suburban @entity12 studio had done a shoddy job of shooting his and @entity19 's december 2003 wedding at a century - old hotel overlooking the @entity124			1
@entity14 , 44 , who has worked as a stock analyst , says the photographer ignored the couple 's request not to shoot in front of a mirror that ended up reflecting photographers ' lights , and the photographer and videographer left 45 minutes before the end of the reception , missing the last dance and the bouquet toss			1
broken marriage : the couple married in front of 40 guests at @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 , but separated in 2008 stunning : the @entity146 where @entity14 married			0
he wants his 2003 wedding re-staged at the upmarket venue and that the photographers from the day to foot the bill			0
@entity152 , who is in her early 30s , had come to @entity12 in june 2002 from the @entity153 to study how to teach @entity154 to foreign - language speakers , according to a piece that september in a @entity158 newspaper			1
the couple had paid a $ 3,500 advance toward a $ 4,100 total price for the photos , part of a wedding he said cost $ 48,000 in all , including guests ' travel			1
still , @entity14 and his bride ' were newly married and in love ' and not looking for a fight with photographers , his statement says			0
@entity174 co-owner @entity173 says he stands by the quality of the two hours of video and the hundreds of color and black - and - white photos , which were shot on film			1
photo company founder @entity180 , who sold his half of the business to his son @entity183 , right , says mr @entity14 does n't even know where his wife lives now ' i think the photography is lovely , ' said @entity173			0
but he said he offered in 2004 to adjust the photos and upgrade the wedding album , telling @entity104 the two needed first to pick out which pictures they wanted			0
' obviously , i could n't turn back the clock , ' @entity173 said			0

no contact information could be found for @entity152			0
the idea of a wedding - photos dispute that outlasted the marriage has been met with raised eyebrows by @entity82 state @entity80 @entity79 , who invoked lyrics from the @entity84 hit ' @entity85 ' in a ruling last year that threw out some legal claims but let others go forward			1
' this is a case in which it appears that the " misty watercolor memories " and the " scattered pictures of the smiles ... left behind " at the wedding were more important than the real thing , ' she wrote			0
