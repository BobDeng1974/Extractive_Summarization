@entity1 chiefs are investigating after two babies died within weeks of each other at a struggling hospital			1
the deaths of both stillborn infants have been classified as ‘ serious incidents ’ at the unit which has previously been criticised for its patient care and deteriorating finances			1
@entity11 and @entity12 was one of 11 @entity1 trusts placed in special measures in july 2013 amid concerns over its above average death rates			1
@entity18 in @entity19 is investigating the deaths of two stillborn babies in september last year it was then given a clean bill of health in june last year , following a ‘ good ’ rating from the @entity26			1
its maternity unit was also the first in the country to receive an ‘ outstanding ’ grade			0
however a regular assessment report has revealed that two babies died within weeks of each other in september , and the hospital has now launched a probe into the matter			1
one of the mothers was induced at @entity18 in @entity19 despite staff not checking her full clinical details first			1
the woman was suffering from high blood pressure , or hypertension , which meant she was categorised as ‘ high risk ’ – though this has not been confirmed as the direct cause of the baby ’s death			1
the other death is ‘ still unexplained ’ pending a post-mortem examination			2
families involved in the deaths have not been named			2
staff have since been instructed to carry out blood pressure tests on women with hypertension as their labour progresses , as the report concluded that there had been ‘ no room for complacency ’ in the monitoring of the first mother or her baby			0
midwives have also been reminded to seek the opinion of medical staff on how to manage women where there is ‘ any deviation from the normal ’			2
the review looked into 37 ‘ serious incidents ’ at the hospital in recent months – 19 of which had ‘ moderate to catastrophic ’ impact on patients			2
@entity76 , mp for @entity77 , said he hoped there would not be a repeat of any mistakes			1
mp @entity76 says the hospital is more open and transparent after previous investigations he said : ' every complex organisation faces a number of challenges but i have complete confidence in the team			2
' the @entity26 has said the trust is moving the right way			0
it does not mean they can be complacent but we need to work with and support them			0
' if the hospital is now reporting more incidents it is because there is now a more open and transparent culture which is willing to accept and investigate mistakes and make sure they do not happen again			2
' however @entity102 , of campaign group @entity1 , said promises of further investigation were ‘ not good enough ’			0
he said : ‘ it is a shame to see the same problems with @entity77 hospital recurring at a time when the @entity26 has deemed this hospital safe enough to be brought out of special measures			1
‘ the hospital ’s normal comment with these sorts of incidents is that they will learn from them but when similar incidents recur year after year it just is not good enough			0
’ a review last year found deaths among weekend admissions contributed to the hospital 's death rate being 11 per cent higher than the average @entity1 hospital			1
in the two years to october 2012 , there were 544 more deaths than expected			0
the trust was removed from special measures last june after the quality of services improved			1
but it emerged last month that health service @entity130 had launched an fresh investigation into the finances of the hospital			1
monitor is concerned about a predicted deficit of £ 14.2m because it is larger than previously expected			0
monitor was told about the loss when a revised deficit plan was submitted in november and will now seek to find out why finances have deteriorated and what can be done to fix them			0
a @entity11 and @entity145 spokesman said : ' it is unclear at this stage whether any of the patients died as a direct result of the serious incident as they are still being investigated			0
' @entity18 is committed to providing all its patients with safe , high - quality treatment and care			0
crucial to that is learning when things go wrong			0
