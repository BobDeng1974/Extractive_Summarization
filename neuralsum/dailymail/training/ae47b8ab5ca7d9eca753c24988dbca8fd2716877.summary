by @entity0 when @entity3 bid £ 12,000 for a racehorse with an unproven track record at an auction his wife called him ' an idiot '			1
but @entity8 was forced to eat her words when the horse , bought after a boozy dinner without knowing anything of its history , won the @entity15 in january this year and saw its value rocket to £ 200,000			1
and today , when the horse took to the starting line for the 3.20pm @entity19 , @entity3 may have allowed himself to believe victory could be his once more			1
but sadly , disappointment reigned as @entity22 failed to finish			0
the 11 - 4 favourite @entity24 was placed first , with @entity25 in second and @entity26 in third			1
@entity22 pulled up before the end			2
@entity28 : @entity3 admitted losing almost bet he placed this week - and would certainly have lost one more when @entity22 failed to finish in the @entity29 this afternoon			1
right : @entity8 looked stylish in grey at the event today also ran : despite showing early promise when it won the @entity15 today , @entity3 's horse failed to impress at @entity35 today @entity8 , dressed in fur - collared taupe coat and a feather - trimmed hat , joined her husband , smart in a three - piece suit , to watch the race			1
@entity41 , who at noon today had odds on @entity44 of 50 - 1 , is co-owned by @entity3 , fellow rugby players @entity45 and @entity47 and @entity48 – son of champion jockey @entity50			1
following the surprise win at the @entity15 along with a win at @entity55 in november last year , the dude 's value soared			1
optimistic : @entity8 and @entity3 at the @entity57 race course yesterday the former @entity59 rugby star explained of his spontaneous buy : ‘ i like to bid at auctions without meaning to actually win things			1
i only went for a bite to eat and a night out			0
no horse had gone for less than £ 28,000 so i thought my first bid of £ 10,000 was pretty safe , likewise when i upped it to £ 12,000			2
‘ i knew nothing about the horse , had n't checked the brochure and could n’t even see the @entity22 , as i was sitting with my back to the sale ring			1
' fortunately @entity48 , @entity74 and @entity47 agreed to share the burden of the cost - and even with today 's loss to contend with , they will no doubt still be pleased that they did , as pundits say we have n't yet seen the best that the dude has to offer			2
surprise success : @entity22 clearing the last to win the @entity55 at @entity35 race course in november last year place your bets : the odds for the @entity19 , showing @entity22 at 50 - 1 as of noon today elsewhere at cheltenham ... ... @entity86 keeps an eye on the race and a tight grip on her betting slip - and lets her composure slip for moment picked a winner ? from @entity86 's expression it looks like today could have been her lucky day thoughts of many at the @entity97 were with leading amateur jockey @entity98 , who remains in hospital in a coma after suffering a serious neck injury when his horse fell			1
the @entity103 , 37 , fell at the first fence while riding @entity105 for trainer @entity106 in the @entity107 yesterday afternoon			0
@entity98 could undergo surgery today			0
medical staff were quickly on hand to treat him after the fall , and he was airlifted to @entity112 in @entity113 by air ambulance from the @entity57 course			0
@entity116 : @entity117 stood out on the grey day in cerise coat and sculptural hat , while @entity121 accessorised her green coat with a gold horse brooch @entity98 's uncle , the trainer @entity124 , said : " i 've been told that @entity125 is in an induced coma at the moment			0
" dr @entity128 , chief medical officer for the @entity129 , reports there to be no change in @entity98 's condition but confirmed the rider has damaged two vertebrae			0
" there has been no change overnight			0
he 's still in the induced coma , " said dr @entity128			0
" it is a fracture of the @entity141 and @entity142 vertebrae			0
he will probably be going for surgery this morning but we will know more later in the day			0
" more than 200,000 people are expected to attend the four - day race meeting , which is one of the highlights of the national hunt season			2
gate receipts are estimated to reach £ 7 million and bookmakers are anticipating a record - breaking year with industry turnover tipped to surpass the £ 600 million barrier			0
racing fan : princess @entity121 attends for the second time this week - and this time will be cheering on her son - in - law 's horse first race of the day : runners in the @entity162 approach the second flight during @entity164 romping home : @entity166 , ridden by @entity167 ( left ) jumps the last to win the @entity169 race , ahead of @entity170 and jockey @entity171			2

@entity22 pulls up before end of @entity19
race won by @entity24 with *sir* @entity175 in 2nd ; @entity26 3rd
@entity3 bought @entity22 on a whim at auction after boozy dinner
said he ' knew nothing ' about the horse . ' i was sitting with my back to the dude and had n't checked the brochure '
@entity8 *dubbed* @entity3 ' an idiot ' - but ate words when @entity41 won @entity15 in january
dude 's value rocketed from £ 12,000 to £ 200,000 after @entity15 win
