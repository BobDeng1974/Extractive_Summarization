@entity0 has suggested that racism might solve lengthy queues at @entity3 @entity0 sparked controversy by suggesting that long queues at airport control could be solved by ' a bit of racism '			1
the @entity11 @entity10 presenter said that delays were caused because immigration officials could no longer use their discretion to wave certain passengers through			1
' nobody is waved through any more			1
immigration officials are not allowed to use their discretion , ' he said			1
' common sense has been erased from the system			2
and the result is plain for all to see			2
there 's a two - hour wait			2
and come the @entity23 they 're saying that time frame will double			2
' net result : immigration officials have to assume that the nice family of four coming back from their holiday in @entity29 is going to cheat the social out of millions then blow up during the 100 metres final			1
' @entity0 then went on to say there is a possible solution to the problem			2
' nobody likes a racist			2
it has no place at work , at play or on the terraces of a football stadium			0
it has no place at school , or in government			0
' but at @entity3 ? hmmm			0
' however , a spokesman for the @entity49 , which represents @entity51 workers , said : ' @entity0 is an idiot			0
' meanwhile , some @entity54 users took to the social networking site to express their views			0
@entity57 , editor of a tangled web , said : ' @entity0 does not " risk outrage "			0

but some said they agreed with his views			0
a woman known only as @entity69 said : ' @entity0 ( sic ) has summed up what will go wrong this summer			0
go jeremy ! he is brilliant			0
' @entity0 used his weekly column in @entity75 to highlight the problem of long waits for those coming through border control at @entity3			0
he said that since security checks were tightened by home secretary @entity82 , officials have been prevented from only targeting those deemed ' high risk '			1
@entity0 , who is no stranger to controversy and has become known for his provocative comments , hit the headlines in december after he suggested that striking public sector workers should be shot in front of their families			0
the gaffe came when he appeared on the @entity11 's @entity91 during @entity93 's biggest public sector strike for the past 30 years			1
for years border officials feebly admitted thousands of people with tenuous claims to be refugees @entity0 has said that immigration officials are not allowed to use common sense at airports the @entity11 was also forced to apologise about an item on @entity102 's @entity10 which led to the @entity104 ambassador complaining about the ' outrageous , vulgar and inexcusable insults ' made about @entity104 by @entity0 and his co-hosts @entity106 and @entity108			1
in february 2009 @entity0 famously insulted then - prime minister @entity109 by calling him a ' one - eyed @entity111 idiot ' - a reference to the fact he is blind in one eye			0
