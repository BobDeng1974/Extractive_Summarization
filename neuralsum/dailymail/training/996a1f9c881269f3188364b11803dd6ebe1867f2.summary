mr @entity2 has made liberalising trade a key aim of the @entity5 's presidency of the @entity34 group of developed economies - pushing for @entity37 deals with both the @entity38 and @entity39 in the absence of @entity13 progress			1
' trade is a vital part of our long - term economic plan and was one of my @entity34 priorities this year , ' he said			0

' this deal will help boost our exports , meaning that @entity5 companies can grow and employ more people			1
' if just 100,000 small businesses either start exporting or spread to new markets over the next five years , this would generate an extra £ 30 billion for the @entity5 economy and create 100,000 new jobs			1
' by slashing barriers to trade , this deal will also provide a lifeline to the world 's poorest people			1
' helping developing countries to grow is not only the right thing to do , but it also increases potential markets for us all			0

for the first time in our history , the @entity13 has truly delivered			2
' important : @entity37 trade commissioner @entity80 described the deal as a ' stepping stone ' a temporary dispensation for developing nations helped see off @entity20 's fears over grain subsidies , and late objections from @entity21 over removing a reference to the @entity38 trade embargo on it were also overcome			2
@entity37 trade commissioner @entity80 said : ' i believe it 's a very important deal			0
it is the first one since the inception of the @entity13 two decades ago			0
' i would argue that what we did today is a quarter of the @entity29 agenda			0
on top of that it 's a stepping stone			0
delighted : trade minister @entity100 described the deal as ' a great day for the global trading system ' ' it will add a lot to the trading capacity of the least - developed countries and developing countries , " he told the @entity104 4 today programme			0
' if they have more trading capacity it will also result in more investment in logistics and infrastructure ... in all kinds of procedures that are part of the trading process , thereby creating new opportunities			0
" @entity121 director - general @entity120 said : ' with many @entity5 businesses looking further afield at new export markets , this deal is good news			1
new business : business secretary @entity127 said : ' cutting red tape and breaking down barriers at borders will create new opportunities , especially for small businesses to export ' ' the new binding commitments to streamline customs procedures and cut red tape will help @entity5 exporters of all sizes to move their products more efficiently around the world			1
' now we need to see ambitious bilateral trade and investment agreements with the @entity38 and @entity142 to provide an additional boost to @entity5 export performance over the long term			2
" trade minister @entity100 , a vice-chair of the @entity14 conference representing developed nations , said : ' this is a great day for the global trading system			0
' we 've demonstrated that the @entity13 can deliver significant multilateral trade deals			2

' it will bring real benefits to businesses in every country , in particular to small firms which are hardest hit by the costs of trading across inefficient borders			0
' business secretary @entity127 said : ' cutting red tape and breaking down barriers at borders will create new opportunities , especially for small businesses to export			0
