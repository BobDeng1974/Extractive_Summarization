@entity0 showed that he is quite prepared to think outside the box by appointing @entity2 , and now he has done it again by appointing @entity4			1
the move , the likelihood of which was revealed eleven days ago in @entity8 , is a groundbreaking one which will make his campaign to defend his @entity13 title all the more fascinating			0
although initially denied , there always seemed to be something in it when she turned up to watch the whole of his first match at the @entity22 and reputable sources suggested that contact had been made between them			0
appointment : @entity0 , training today at @entity27 , has appointed @entity4 as his new coach top job : the two - time @entity31 winner will take over in time for @entity27 's @entity0 knew that he could not replicate the presence of @entity2 – who had little coaching experience before their famously successful partnership , but what he is looking for is someone who can add that little extra input which , at the rarefied level he plays at , can be the difference between winning and losing			1
the appointment is initially for the grasscourt season spanning @entity27 ’s and @entity13 , but it has very much been made with the longer term in mind			2
' i ’m excited by the possibilities of the new partnership and @entity4 is someone i have always looked up to and admired , ' said @entity0 of the appointment			1
' excited ' : @entity0 said @entity4 was someone he ' always looked up to and admired ' @entity49 : @entity4 won @entity13 in 2006 and the @entity50 in the same year ' she ’s faced adversity plenty of times in her career , but was an amazing player and won major titles , including @entity13			1
' i have a very strong coaching team already in place , but i think @entity4 brings with her experience and tactical expertise and will push us all to improve			1
everyone i know talks very highly of @entity4 , as a person and coach , and i ’m convinced that her joining the team will help us push on - i want to win more grand slams			1
' as @entity0 said in response to @entity8 ’s story that @entity4 was in the frame , the presence of a woman can tame the egos that sometimes prevail when you have an all - male team			1
and she is someone he can respect as she is a proven winner like he is , rather than purely a professional coach who can work as a technician on his game , which is unlikely to radically change anyway at this point of his career			2
previous : @entity4 already has experience of coaching man , having worked with @entity86 exit : @entity0 lost to @entity88 in the semi-finals of the @entity22 in @entity90 @entity4 was an athletic all court player who won both the @entity50 and @entity13 , and she herself is an innovative thinker like him who will relish the challenge of taking on such a fascinating individual who always has the capacity to surprise			1
this and the pure fact that he is now stepping out on his beloved grass should be a tonic after the thumping he received from @entity88 in @entity90 on friday			0
@entity4 also has experience of coaching a man , having worked with @entity105 @entity86 over the grass court season of 2010 when he won the @entity108 event			1
she was also in the team of @entity110 when she won @entity13 last year , so she is well qualified on all sides to understand the unique pressures of lasting the whole fortnight at the @entity114			0
tonic : @entity0 will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of @entity88 ' i ’m really excited to be able to work with @entity0 , ' said @entity4 , who won @entity13 and the @entity50 in 2006			1
' he ’s an amazingly talented tennis player and i feel i have plenty to offer both him and the team around him			0
i ’m looking forward to getting down to work and helping him win more @entity31			2
a little like @entity2 , she may also serve to deflect some of those pressures just by being there on his bench alongside his trusted assistant coach @entity127			1
she added : ' @entity0 contacted me a few weeks ago and we started to talk about this possibility to work , to be working together			1
it 's not really something that i was thinking doing when i stopped being a tennis player			2
' then we talked again a little bit more about how to do the things maybe about his game , about different things			0
' we came up with the will from both sides to , yeah , to give it a shot			0
contact : @entity4 said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks long term : @entity4 suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis ' we all know his mother was a big part of his tennis career			1
i think he 's maybe looking for something different , about emotions and sensitive things			2
it 's not really interesting for me , this part of the story , to be honest			2
all i 'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals			0
the rest is the story for you to write , i guess			0
' but , yeah , for me it 's a challenge			0
i want to take it			0
' she clearly suggested that both were looking long term and when asked about how much time they would spend together said : ' not the whole year , not as full time , but , yes , a significant amount of weeks that we have agreed on and should be good for everyone			0
' women coaching men in professional tennis is not unknown at present but it is highly unusual			0
@entity180 ’s @entity179 is coached by his mother , while another top 100 player , @entity183 ’s @entity182 , is coached by his wife @entity184			0
@entity0 has already drawn praise from many figures in the women ’s game such as @entity189 for contemplating having a woman in charge , and now he has followed through on that			2
@entity8 's tennis correspondent @entity193 first revealed the possibility of @entity4 taking over as @entity0 's coach on may 27 .			1

@entity197 has appointed two - time @entity31 champion
@entity105 is also a former @entity200 1
@entity0 has been without a coach since splitting with @entity2
@entity4 will take up her new role in time for @entity27 's this week
he said : ' @entity4 brings with ere experience and tactical expertise '
@entity4 added she is ' really excited ' to be working with the @entity210
