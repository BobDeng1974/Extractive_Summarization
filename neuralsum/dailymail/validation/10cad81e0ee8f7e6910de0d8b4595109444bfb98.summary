his three opponents will all be in favour			0
@entity11 has yet to respond to the @entity19 - @entity20 letter but it is unlikely he ’ll agree to such public exposure the official photo of the @entity14 summit shows @entity0 seated between , of all people , @entity11 and @entity64 ’s @entity63 , whose presence at @entity15 ’s @entity66 as a representative of the @entity68 was bizarre in the extreme			1
makudi has an acrimonious history with the @entity1 and is under investigation by @entity5 ’s ethics committee for breaching @entity75 bid rules			2
it ’s understood @entity63 played no part in the rules debate			0

the three other countries believe the agreement was nullified by a new statute that has all @entity93 associations involved in the vote at the @entity95 later this month			0
but @entity97 president @entity96 says he has a signed contract in his possession that declares no change can be made in the rotation pledge unless there is unanimous agreement			0

@entity132 's @entity131 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity134 during their @entity75 match @entity20 on @entity136 @entity138 ’s live text reporting of @entity140 ’s @entity75 victory over @entity132 seems to have relied heavily on rival website @entity142			1
@entity134 ’s dismissal , bowled by @entity131 , was described in the following way on @entity142 : ‘ @entity134 made it look an even better delivery than it actually was , because he had moved inside the line and was trying to push that inside - out through cover			2
