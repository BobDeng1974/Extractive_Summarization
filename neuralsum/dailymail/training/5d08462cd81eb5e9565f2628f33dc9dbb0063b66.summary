for this poor chap , known as @entity8 , fooling his brain into thinking he was on a roller coaster almost made him vomit			2
wearing a visor so all he can see is the virtual ride and listening to the sound of the clunking tracks , it only takes the first ' climb ' on the ride before he begins to look uncomfortable			1
as we see the virtual ride approaches its first ' drop ' , the man tenses up in anticipation , and a friend comes in close behind in case he falls			1
he then screams , clearly in absolute terror			2
his friend , who is filming the whole experience , laughs uncontrollably as the virtual roller coaster ride sends his friend stumbling backwards			1
at one point his knees appear to go and he almost falls to the floor , but is caught by someone stood behind him			1
he then falls backwards screaming and is fortunately caught by a friend clearly in absolute terror by the whole experience he yells and holds his head , while stumbling ' no , no , no ! ' he shouts			2
notes and comments on the hilarious clip , posted on @entity53 , reveal the boys are from @entity55 , @entity56 , and were trying out a demo made by a forum member on @entity59			1
the publisher , ' ibarakiprefecture ' , says : ' this is not a fake reaction			0
' he went on : ' he was drunk , and he always acts crazy like this			0
we were at a fighting game tournament and he was drunk and hype			0
i recorded a bunch of people that day			0
' i did this for fun , because it 's interesting to watch different people 's reactions ' at one point his knees buckle beneath him and he collapses to the ground , clasping his hand over his mouth viewers can watch what @entity8 's brain thinks he is experiencing on the computer screen			1
the publisher goes on to explain that not everyone has reacted in the same way ; the most extreme reactions are from those who suffer from motion sickness			0
the virtual roller coaster experience is less than two minutes long , but @entity8 could n't wait to tear the visor and ear phones off him			2
after screaming and collapsing to the floor , he yells : ' get this off me , get this off me , get this off me , ' and appears to be retching			0
he storms out of the area , saying : ' i 'm done '			0
unable to stand up , he shouts for help , yelling , ' get this off me ! ' traumatised @entity8 sits on the floor trying to gain some composure and balance , before storming out			0
