by @entity1 reporter sleep boosts the production of brain support cells , new research has revealed			1
scientists found sleep increases the reproduction of cells that form the insulating material known as myelin , which is essential for the brain to function properly			2
the findings could one day lead scientists to new insights about sleep â€™s role in brain repair and growth and a new understanding about multiple sclerosis , a disease that damages myelin			1
sleep boosts the production of brain cells necessary for it to function properly , new study finds researchers have known for years that many genes are turned on during sleep and off during periods of wakefulness			1
however , it was unclear how sleep affects specific cells types , such as oligodendrocytes , which make myelin in the healthy brain and in response to injury			2
much like the insulation around an electrical wire , myelin allows electrical impulses to move rapidly from one cell to the next			1
doctor @entity44 and colleagues at the @entity46 in the @entity47 measured gene activity in oligodendrocytes from mice that slept or were forced to stay awake			2
they found that genes promoting myelin formation were turned on during sleep			0
in contrast , the genes implicated in cell death and the cellular stress response were turned on when the animals stayed awake			0
dr @entity44 speculated the findings , published in the @entity61 , suggest that extreme and / or chronic sleep loss could possibly aggravate some symptoms of multiple sclerosis ( @entity65 )			1
@entity46 research showed sleeping helps growth of myelin which allows electrical impulses to move rapidly from one cell to the next she said that future experiments may examine whether or not an association between sleep patterns and severity of @entity65 symptoms exists			1
additional analysis revealed that the reproduction of oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( @entity79 ) - cells that become oligodendrocytes - doubles during sleep , particularly during rapid eye movement ( @entity84 ) , which is associated with dreaming			0
dr @entity44 said : ' for a long time , sleep researchers focused on how the activity of nerve cells differs when animals are awake versus when they are asleep			0
' now it is clear that the way other supporting cells in the nervous system operate also changes significantly depending on whether the animal is asleep or awake			0
' doctor @entity94 , who studies sleep at the @entity96 in @entity97 but was not involved in the study , said : ' these findings hint at how sleep or lack of sleep might repair or damage the brain			0

research by @entity46 showed sleep boosts myelin
@entity109 allows electrical impulses to move rapidly from one cell to the next
scientists say findings could give new understanding about multiple sclerosis , a disease that damages myelin
suggest extreme or chronic sleep loss could aggravate some @entity65 symptoms
