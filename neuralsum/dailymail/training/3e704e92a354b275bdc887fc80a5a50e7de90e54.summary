by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 18 april 2013 @entity2 @entity1 said : ' after the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy , there is a great calm ¿ at @entity10 's funeral the @entity2 paid tribute to @entity10 yesterday by saying that ‘ after the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy , there is a great calm ’			1
he added : ‘ lying here , she is one of us , subject to the common destiny of all			2
’ the funeral address by the right reverend @entity1 was the centrepiece of a simple service ; at @entity10 ’s own request there were no eulogies			1
his words delighted the former prime minister ’s allies and prompted tears and laughter as he applauded her strength of character and methodist faith			0
he also debunked controversy over the most provocative quote of @entity10 ’s career – that there is ‘ no such thing as society ’			1
in an address deemed perfectly pitched by her closest friends in politics , the bishop hailed her as a ‘ mythological figure ’ and went out of his way to draw a line under the comment that has been a millstone around @entity52 necks since she delivered it in 1987 – setting it in its proper context			1
he said the former premier had referred to the @entity60 doctrine , ‘ that we are all members one of another , expressed in the concept of the @entity64 on earth as the body of @entity67 ’			0
‘ from this we learn our interdependence and the great truth that we do not achieve happiness or salvation in isolation from each other but as members of society , ’ he quoted her saying			2
‘ her later remark about there being no such thing as “ society ” has been misunderstood , and refers to some impersonal entity to which we are tempted to surrender our independence , ’ he explained			1
‘ she was very aware there are prior dispositions which are needed to make market economics and democratic institutions function well : the habits of truth - telling , mutual sympathy , and the capacity to co-operate			0
these dispositions are incubated and given power by our relationships			0
‘ in her words , “ the basic ties of the family are at the heart of our society and are the very nursery of civic virtue ”			2
’ the @entity2 @entity1 paid tribute to @entity10 's ¿ courtesy and personal kindness ' at her funeral on wednesday @entity2 @entity1 ( left ) stood with the @entity105 and the @entity106 and the archbishop of @entity108 , @entity109 ( right ) , behind @entity10 's children @entity111 , right , and @entity112 , left conservative mp @entity113 , an aide to minister without portfolio @entity114 , said : ‘ @entity116 chose to dispel one of the @entity119 ’s many smears that mrs @entity10 did n’t believe in society			1
it is a long overdue correction			0
’ the bishop paid tribute to @entity10 ’s ‘ courtesy and personal kindness which she showed to those who worked for her , as well as her capacity to reach out to the young , and often also to those who were not , in the world ’s eyes , “ important ”			1
’ he added that it was important to debate @entity10 ’s policies and legacy and to assess the impact of political decisions on the everyday lives of individuals and communities			2
but he insisted : ‘ @entity142 held a frank debate last week – but here and today is neither the time nor the place			0
this , at @entity10 ’s personal request , is a funeral service , not a memorial service with the customary eulogies			1
at @entity10 's request the service did not include eulogies and instead featured an address from the @entity2 , @entity1 , left , pictured with the @entity105 and the @entity106 and the archbishop of canterbury @entity109 ‘ at such a time , the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician ; instead this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling			1
‘ it is also the place for the simple truths which transcend political debate			0
above all it is the place for hope			0
’ he said she described her religious upbringing in a lecture she gave in the nearby church of @entity172 : ‘ her upbringing , of course , was in @entity176 to which this country owes a huge debt			0
when it was time to challenge the political and economic status quo in 19th century @entity182 , it was so often the @entity183 who took the lead			0
’ the @entity2 pointed out it was the @entity176 tradition that inspired the @entity187 , who , in protest at wage cuts , formed the first trade union .			2

@entity2 *praised* @entity10 's courtesy and personal kindness
funeral had no eulogies , only @entity2 's address at @entity10 's request
@entity2 said her ' no such thing as society ' comment was misunderstood
