we ’ve got @entity1 hosting the @entity2 next year and @entity3 launching his own @entity5 tournament in his hometown of @entity7 in july			2
@entity8 is the man behind an event in @entity10			2
now , i can reveal , the leading @entity13 players are ready to play their part as well			2
beginning in october next year , the @entity16 masters will be held for the first time since 2008 , with @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 taking it in turns to play the role of host			1
the rotation will begin with @entity18 welcoming the great and good to the course in @entity13 with which he has long been associated — @entity29			1
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) will both take it in turns to host the @entity16 masters @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) will also be handed the opportunity of hosting the @entity16 masters ‘ i ca n’t wait , ’ @entity18 told @entity33			1
‘ it has been far too long since @entity29 hosted a tour event			2
‘ when you think of the history there , with wins for the likes of @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , ( @entity45 ) @entity44 and @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , it deserves to have a @entity49 event again			0
‘ it has been in fantastic condition for the last few years			0
it will be a great week and obviously a very proud one for me			0
’ @entity19 was equally enthusiastic			0
‘ we ’ve been going on about @entity13 having another event for long enough and it ’s great that it looks like it is finally going to happen , ’ he said			0
‘ let ’s hope we can find the right date in the calendar			0
we ’ve all seen how the @entity58 at @entity59 has grown over the years			0
it ’s now one of the best events we play and i ’m sure the fans would flock to a good tournament in october			2
it seems like a perfect fit			0
’ ‘ what an incredible 2014			0
i see @entity69 in @entity70			0
’ @entity72 @entity71 salutes @entity1 on the eve of the @entity75 ’s final appearance of his amazing season — the defence of his @entity79 title in @entity80 this week			0
he also predicts that @entity1 will complete the career @entity82 at the masters next april at the age of just 25			2
is there a particular course where @entity19 would like to play host ? ‘ i think i ’ll have to get back to the @entity16 and play a few of the courses like @entity92 and @entity29 and see which one would suit me , ’ said the @entity89 - based 36 - year - old , smiling			1
the @entity16 masters did n’t feature on the 2015 @entity49 schedule which was released on sunday , but tour officials are confident it will take place in the currently vacant week of october 8 - 11			1
‘ there ’s a couple of @entity101 and @entity102 to dot and cross but we do n’t foresee any problems , ’ said a tour official			0
‘ i ’m sure it will happen			0
’ the event would follow the @entity107 and take place a fortnight before the start of the four - event @entity111 in @entity113			0
the @entity114 was last played at @entity29 in 2002 , when @entity115 prevailed following a thrilling duel against @entity18			1
in the years since , @entity115 has become a major champion , @entity18 a @entity119 legend and @entity20 and @entity19 have reached no 1 in the world			1
now comes the revival of an iconic tournament , and a fitting way to recognise their achievements			0
who is @entity128 ' mysterious new coach ? from @entity129 to @entity72 to the @entity130 , the same question on various tours around the world was being asked on saturday night : who the heck is @entity136 ? such was the clamour to find out something about @entity128 ’ new mystery swing coach , @entity141 ’s website crashed only minutes after the news was released and his @entity144 account gained several thousand more followers overnight			1
turns out @entity136 is a 37 - year - old @entity146 who has worked with the likes of @entity149 @entity148 and @entity72 @entity150 and has a healthy interest in golfing biomechanics — in other words , helping players swing the club in a manner that avoids injury			1
@entity128 last played at the @entity158 and has appointed @entity136 as a new swing coach given @entity128 ’s problems , if the new man comes up with something that keeps @entity162 fit and playing for the next decade he ’ll become as famous as @entity164			1
woods was introduced to the fourth swing coach of his 20 - year career by his long - time friend from his university days , @entity168 , whose own career was curtailed by a back injury			1
‘ subsequently , @entity136 and i had several good conversations about the golf swing , ’ said @entity128			1
‘ i ’ve worked with him for about a month since i started practising again , and @entity136 will consult and work with me during the year			1
’ the first fruits of their collaboration will be seen when @entity128 returns to the game in the tournament he hosts , the @entity179 , in @entity180 next week			1
with this news following his criticism of a much commented - upon article in @entity184 , which he called a ‘ grudge - fuelled piece of character assassination ’ , @entity128 is certainly doing his bit to drum up publicity .			2

the @entity16 masters will be held for first time since 2008 in october 2015
@entity18 has revealed he ' ca *n't* wait ' to host @entity16 masters
@entity128 ' new coach @entity136 is an expert in helping players swing the club in a manner that avoids injury
