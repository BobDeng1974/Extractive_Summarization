by @entity0 for @entity1 a description of @entity4 by @entity5 as an ‘ uncircumcised old geezer ’ is further evidence of @entity9 involvement in the militant organisation , a terrorism expert has said			1
the comment about the @entity12 secretary of state came in an audio recording by @entity5 spokesman @entity14			1
he said : ' the uncircumcised old geezer , suddenly became an @entity16 jurist , issuing a verdict to the people that the @entity19 was distorting @entity16 , that what it was doing was against @entity16 teachings , and that the @entity19 was an enemy of @entity16			0
' connection : the use of the word ' geezer ' in the translation of @entity14 's description of @entity4 is yet more evidence of strong ties between @entity9 and @entity5 , according to an expert professor @entity33 , head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the @entity37 , said the use of @entity9 slang was hugely significant			1
he told @entity1 : ‘ i 'd say the use of the word " geezer " is a massively important further giveaway about the identity of some of these @entity5 thugs			1
it 's a term most usually heard in @entity47			2
' so @entity5 have drawn us , i 'd suspect intentionally , back towards reflecting on the fact that brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers , taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and our position in the world			2
' his comments came as experts revealed that the terrorist group is using its control of oil fields to fund its brutal operations			1
@entity9 's link to @entity19 became known around the world after shocking videos showed a @entity9 man known as ' @entity69 ' executing @entity12 journalists @entity70 , 40 , and @entity72 , 31 , as well as @entity9 aid worker @entity73 , 44			1
some sources believe that @entity69 comes from a @entity47 suburb about 10 miles from @entity76			1
professor @entity33 added : ' it 's my understanding that @entity79 and the counter-terrorism police do know the identity of " @entity69 " but that like the @entity9 government more generally they do n't see any advantage at this stage in telling the rest of us , not so much out of consideration to " @entity69 's " family but to the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here , and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before we take it			1
' low blow : the group called @entity4 an ' uncircumcised old geezer ' after his comments that the terrorist organization ' did not represent @entity16 ' in front of the @entity101 it was made as a fuller picture emerged of @entity5 's vast wealth - estimated to be around $ 1.5billion - and slick operation			1
one @entity106 told the @entity107 that he had a job interview with @entity5 to work in its media centre in @entity111 , @entity106 's capital , and that he was amazed at the salary he was offered and the equipment he would have at his disposal			2
the man , who turned the job down , said : ' they offered me $ 1,500 a month [ five times the average @entity106 salary ] , plus a car , a house and all the cameras i needed			0
i remembered looking around the office			0
it was amazing the equipment they had in there			0
' the @entity12 is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group 's money is coming from			0
@entity131 and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week 's annual @entity134			0
and a new @entity12 - based research group called the @entity136 is poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of information about militants and their supporters			2
it 's convinced that @entity5 is generating a great deal of wealth from shady deals with morally compromised companies			2
risk management group @entity148 believes that @entity5 controls half a dozen oil fields in @entity106 and four in @entity151 , with many officials convinced it 's making millions from smuggling barrels to @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity151			1
the group is also known to make money from kidnappings , extortion and robbery			0
more airstrikes are expected this week against the group , and @entity12 ambassador to the @entity134 @entity164 said on @entity165 sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the @entity12 in these strikes , though she would not say what countries			0
these strikes have already begun in @entity151 , and been authorized to begin in @entity106 by @entity131			0
