remote : @entity3 is home to a caravan park , is surrounded by bushland and is often the subject of day trips for families at this time of year ' we saw all this splashing around in front of us ... you could tell by the way the tail was moving – dolphins ' tails go up and down and sharks go side to side			0
it was also very big ; well over two metres long and it looked a bit menacing , ' mrs @entity0 said of her shark sighting ' we visit every so often but i would n't have had a clue who to report it to , ' she said			2
' we 've seen dolphins and whales there before and my husband saw wobbegong sharks when he was younger – bit closer to the actual beach , but i 've never seen anything close to a shark in the water there before , so when we saw it we were all thinking it was amazing without thinking anything about it			2
' having the tragedy happen has made us all kind of think , well maybe we should have reported it			0
' ' they [ mr @entity6 's family ] are from a small town close to @entity18 where we do our shopping – we know the shop that his family owned and i work at a school and know kids who know him			0
