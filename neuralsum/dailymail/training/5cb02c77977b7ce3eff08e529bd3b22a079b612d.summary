by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 01:22 est , 11 june 2013 the draw of @entity3 as a magnet for migrants from across @entity6 gathered strength last year , official figures showed yesterday			2
numbers of @entity10 citizens coming to take jobs in this country went up – even though @entity13 and other major economies opened their doors for the first time to workers from @entity18 and @entity6			1
and nearly one in four of all the international migrants who found work in @entity6 countries came to take jobs here , nearly double the numbers of immigrants who went to work in @entity13 , the analysis found			0
it is estimated that more than 700,000 people from @entity30 could try to find work and settle in @entity3 the count carried out by the @entity10 statistics arm @entity34 is powerful evidence of @entity3 ’s continuing status as the preferred destination for workers from elsewhere in @entity6 and from around the world			1
it adds further weight to the argument that @entity30 and @entity44 workers will put @entity3 top of their list of potential destinations when labour market restrictions that prevent them taking jobs here are lifted at the beginning of next year			1
at the weekend the @entity30 think - tank @entity52 projected that a quarter of the country ’s population of young workers aged between 18 and 35 would pick a job in this country when the barriers are removed			0
the estimate means that more than 700,000 people from the country could try to find work and settle in @entity3			0
the wave of migration from @entity18 and seven other @entity6 countries which joined the @entity10 in 2004 has brought more than a million of their citizens to @entity3			1
according to the new count from @entity72 - based @entity34 , which is based on national labour force surveys , slightly over 216,000 @entity10 citizens working in @entity3 in 2012 said they had arrived over the previous two years , an increase of over 10 per cent on 2010 levels			1
around half of these workers are likely to have come from @entity6			0
their numbers now look certain to have been greater than numbers of @entity6 citizens who took the opportunity to work in @entity13 after @entity84 opened its labour market to people from @entity18 and the other eastern @entity6 @entity10 members in may 2011			1
numbers of @entity10 workers moving into @entity13 doubled to 166,500 over the two years prior to 2012 , going up from 80,500 recorded in a similar count in 2010			2
the figures suggested that the end of restrictions on @entity6 labour brought in around 80,000 new workers			0
sir @entity96 of the @entity97 think tank said : ‘ what these figures say is that over the past two years nearly twice as many foreign workers came to @entity3 than to @entity13			0
‘ this is despite @entity13 ’s opening of its labour market to @entity6 in may 2011 and despite the lower growth in the @entity3 economy			0
this is a further pointer towards a significant inflow of @entity30 and @entity44 workers into @entity3 next year			1
’ the increase in numbers of @entity6 workers in @entity3 came at a time when @entity113 immigration curbs were first beginning to take effect			2
this meant the numbers of workers who said they had come to this country from outside @entity6 , and who do not benefit from @entity10 freedom of movement rules , fell slightly , from 184,000 to 183,000			2
@entity10 countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis , such as @entity124 and @entity125 , showed major falls in numbers of immigrant workers			0
the @entity34 figures also showed that workers from other @entity10 countries are less likely to be unemployed in @entity3 than native @entity3 workers .			1

numbers of @entity10 citizens taking jobs in @entity3 went up from last year
it adds further weight to the argument that @entity30 and @entity44 workers want to come to @entity3 to work
