by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 3 may 2012 it has been many years since @entity2 was the jewel of @entity5 seaside resorts			1
but its fading image has taken another battering , as its beaches have today been named and shamed , once again , among @entity5 ’s worst			1
experts warned that ‘ no - swimming ’ signs may soon be erected in @entity2 and elsewhere along the @entity12 coastline unless the water quality is urgently improved			1
iconic : a child having a donkey ride on @entity2 beach in 2015 stringent @entity18 rules will see the warning signs put up if a beach consistently fails an inspection			1
the latest failure for @entity2 was issued by the @entity23 in its @entity24 and will undoubtedly alarm tourism chiefs in the area			1
of the 25 beaches the campaign group failed , six were on the @entity12 coastline , including two in @entity2			1
@entity30 , pollution programme manager for the campaign group , said : ‘ this problem goes back for as long as i can remember and i ’ve been coming here for 20 - odd years			2
‘ this is a lesson @entity2 is just not learning or a message they are not heeding			2
i keep explaining what the problems are and how they need to be addressed and we are just not progressing			0
‘ by 2015 the standards for water quality are being tightened			0
if they are failing now they wo n’t stand a chance of passing by then			0
wet weekend in @entity2 : the outlook for the town has n't improved since the damp @entity47 bank holiday ‘ and if they fail the bathing water quality inspection over five consecutive years they will be forced to erect signs warning tourists not to go into the water			1
‘ they might as well flush the millions they have spent regenerating the area down the sewer			2
’ mr @entity30 said the local council had failed to accept the ‘ magnitude ’ of the problem and together with the environment agency and local water companies had become embroiled in ‘ a circle of blame ’			0
‘ this has been dragging on for a very long time and it ’s the entire @entity12 coast that urgently needs attention , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s consistently the worst - performing part of the @entity5 – not just @entity71 , but the whole of the @entity5			1
‘ we have isolated resorts elsewhere that fail every so often but we are consistently failing an entire coastline			0
’ overall , however , more than two - thirds of @entity5 beaches surveyed last summer – 516 out of 754 – were recommended for ‘ excellent ’ water quality			1
this is an 8 per cent rise on the previous year ’s figures , and the best set of results in 25 years of the guide			0
but the @entity23 warned that the heavy rainfall of the past week could see raw sewage from overflow pipes enter bathing areas			0
the @entity88 was the best - performing region , with 53 out of 64 beaches recommended for excellent water quality			2
the @entity90 was worst with only eight out of 37 beaches recommended			0
in the @entity93 94 out of 126 beaches were recommended while 154 out of 193 in the @entity94 were praised .			0

@entity18 rules will see the warning signs put up if a beach consistently fails inspections
@entity2 *'s* latest failure will alarm tourism chiefs in the area
in rest of country more than two - thirds of @entity5 beaches surveyed last summer were ' excellent ’
