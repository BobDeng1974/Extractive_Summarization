by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 24 december 2012 @entity4 's recent rocket launch shows it has likely developed the technology to fire a warhead more than 6,200 miles - putting @entity7 , and the @entity8 in range , @entity2 officials said yesterday			1
the secretive state claimed the december 12 launch put a weather satellite in orbit but critics say it was aimed at nurturing the kind of technology needed to mount a nuclear warhead on a long - range missile			1
@entity2 retrieved and analysed parts of the first - stage rocket after debris fell into the waters off its west coast			1
the @entity51 condemned the launch earlier this month			0
@entity4 's previous missile tests ended in failure			0
the country , which regularly denounces the @entity56 as a warmonger , has spent decades trying to develop technology capable of striking long range targets			0
it is also working to build a nuclear arsenal			0
the @entity62 released this picture of the inside of the @entity4 rocket the rocket wreckage was fished out of the sea by @entity2			1
a minesweeper equipped with the sonar system detected three parts of the rocket in waters but experts believe the @entity4 is still years away from mastering the technology needed to miniaturise a nuclear bomb to mount on a missile			2
@entity2 defence officials also said there was no confirmation whether the @entity4 had the re-entry technology needed for a payload to survive the heat and vibration without disintegrating			2
despite international condemnation , the launch this month was seen as a major boost domestically to the credibility of the @entity4 's young leader @entity88 , who took over power from his father who died last year			1
he has called for the development of more powerful rockets after the successful satellite launch			0
he told the project 's backers at a banquet held in their honour that he wanted ' a variety of more working satellites ' and ' carrier rockets of bigger capacity '			2
the speech on friday marks the first time he is explicitly calling for the advancement of his country 's long - range rocket programme .			0

debris from the rocket was found off the @entity2 coast
@entity4 said december 12 launch was to put a satellite in space
critics argue technology could be a *precursor* to nuclear missiles
new leader @entity88 wants bigger capacity rockets to be built
