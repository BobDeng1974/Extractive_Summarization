online shopping has grown to such an extent that for the first time it now accounts for almost one third of household purchases , apart from groceries			2
one in three home appliances , items of clothing and furniture are bought using the internet , according to research by the @entity13			2
overall , more than £ 1 in every £ 5 of all non-food spending is now being done online			1
the astonishing demand left many websites unable to cope , with the result that shoppers suffered ‘ screen freeze ’ and some retailers are still struggling to make deliveries			2
customers at @entity33 face a wait of ten days to get their purchases , while @entity36 has suffered delays in its click - and - collect service , and the online fashion chain @entity40 has suspended a large part of its next day delivery system			1
further pressure was put on delivery services yesterday with websites expecting a further shopping binge on what is known in the industry as ‘ @entity49 ’			2
the deals offered online by specialist web stores such as @entity52 as well as high street giants including @entity36 , @entity54 , @entity33 , @entity55 , @entity56 and the big department stores have triggered an unprecedented spending splurge			2
all types of fruit and vegetables , fresh , frozen , canned , dried , or pure juices ( fruit , vegetable or smoothie ) , including those within composite foods , count towards the five or more daily portions			1
a portion is generally taken to be 80g ( or equivalent if dried or a concentrated puree ) or 150ml of 100 per cent pure fruit juice			1
certain criteria that apply to the logo scheme do not necessarily apply to the five - a - day health promotion message			1
although a particular food would not necessarily be able to carry a 5 a day logo , if it contains a sufficient amount of fruit or vegetables it would count towards an individual 's intake as consumed			1
for example , currently a vegetarian chilli ready meal would not be able to apply for a 5 a day logo as it is a composite food			1
however , an individual consuming this would be able to count the vegetable content as contributing to their own five - a - day			1
the £ 810million figure for internet sales on @entity24 was almost 50 per cent higher than expected by the industry			2
the @entity13 director general , @entity94 , said : ‘ this month brings fantastic news for retailers who have worked hard on their online presence , as the online penetration rate of non-food sales is at an all - time record			0
‘ every £ 1 in £ 5 of non-food purchases is spent online			1
online sales are also contributing a larger proportion of growth to non-food sales compared to in - store			0
‘ @entity24 was the retail event of the month and retailers offered consumers impressive discounts both online and in - store			0
the high volume traffic to websites meant that consumers also bought a large amount of full priced items and not just those on sale			0
‘ online sales growth was good for the month but there may have been a distortion caused by @entity24 with consumers delaying purchases until the end of the month in the hope of grabbing some bargains			0
’ the @entity13 ranks retail sectors in terms of their annual growth			0
health and beauty products saw the biggest increase in sales , ahead of household appliances , particularly flat screen tvs			0
the @entity13 said : ‘ there were widespread discounts for @entity24 , with particularly aggressive deals among fashion retailers , who used the opportunity to lower their stocks after the unseasonably warm autumn quarter we ’ve just seen			0
a panel of experts from @entity20 ( @entity20 ) has discussed the idea of expanding the logo to include ' composite ' foods , which contain at least one portion of fruit and vegetables ‘ household appliances – for its first appearance in the monitor – moved straight to second position and finished the month on a very strong note , thanks to @entity24			1
’ based on 300g cheese and tomato pizza thick crust - 836 calories 8.5g of sugar total fat - 31.5g saturated fat - 15.5g salt - 3.3g @entity162 , the head of retail at @entity164 , said : ‘ online orders reached record breaking penetration levels this november , as shoppers snapped up a bargain in the @entity24 sales			1
‘ however , retailers ’ online systems have been tested and some have been found wanting			0
‘ the sheer weight of consumer demand caused some websites to buckle under the pressure and these retailers need to sort this capacity issue out and quickly or face losing sales to competitors with more robust systems			0
‘ online sales will help to drive growth for retailers this @entity184 and are a crucial element of their overall strategy			0
’ he added : ‘ after years of slow growth this @entity184 could be a cracker for the retail sector , with sales surpassing last year ’s levels			0
online sales will be launched as early as @entity184 and shoppers will be able to pick up a bargain while tucking into their turkey			1

@entity20 considering extending government 's 5 a day logo
at present , logo launched in 2003 is limited to plain fruit and vegetables
but could soon include foods which have at least one portion of fruit or veg
this would mean *ham* and *pineapple* pizza and ready meals would *qualify*
