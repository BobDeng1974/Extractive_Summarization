if @entity1 are going to exceed expectations and challenge for the @entity3 they will need @entity4 to stay fit and firing as he did in the demolition of @entity6			1
@entity7 grabbed the plaudits in the nine - wicket victory at the @entity10 , but @entity4 set the tone for what came close to the perfect team bowling performance			1
he was not fit enough to return against @entity14 in @entity15 after missing the one - day tour to @entity17 with a knee problem but was at his best in @entity19 , taking four for 18 as @entity6 were skittled for 153			1
‘ i felt good and the wickets were a bonus , ’ said @entity4			2
@entity4 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity23 during the tri-series win @entity4 is congratulated by @entity26 after dismissing @entity6 's @entity27 in tuesday 's match ‘ i ’ve been bowling well since i went to @entity29 before @entity30 — it ’s just been trying to get my fitness right			1
’ @entity7 also shone , taking five wickets a year on from being sent home from @entity14 , and @entity4 can relate to what he has gone through			1
‘ i ’ve spoken to him here and i was texting him when he was in @entity17 , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s lots of similarities between his path and mine so i try to help him			0
he deserved to put in a performance after all the work he ’s put in and his return is huge because he bowls wicket - taking balls			0
’ @entity1 have now gone south to @entity46 to take on @entity14 at the @entity47 on thursday			2
@entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 are missing and @entity1 know a win will take them into the tri-series final			1
@entity4 ended the match with four wickets for just 18 runs as @entity1 cruised to victory @entity7 took all the plaudits , however , as he took five wickets the suspicion remains that their attack lacks the variety to go all the way in the @entity3 , but @entity4 insisted : ‘ we ’re all very different bowlers			1
we may not be blessed with a left - armer but we ’ve got a good enough attack to bowl teams out			0
’ @entity49 ’s absence is , @entity14 insist , down to a sore hamstring rather than any disciplinary measure , though players ’ behaviour has been in focus after his clash with @entity6 ’s @entity76			2
yet @entity4 is adamant that the sport does not have an attitude problem			0
‘ i do n’t think there are more verbals than at any time in the history of cricket , ’ he said			0
‘ there is just more of a spotlight on it with stump mics and more cameras			0
it has happened for more than a hundred years so it is n’t just going to disappear			0
