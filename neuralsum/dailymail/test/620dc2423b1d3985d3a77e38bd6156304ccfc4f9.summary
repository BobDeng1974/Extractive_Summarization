@entity1 manager @entity0 insists he is better than many of the @entity4 's big - name managers but has no immediate plans to leave @entity6 for a table - topping side			1
@entity1 have won six out of 10 league games since @entity0 succeeded @entity9 at the start of the year to all but guarantee their place in the @entity4 next season			2
the @entity1 were in the bottom three when @entity0 took over and their climb up the table has succeeded in easing relegation fears and subsequently boosting the profile of a manager who has yet to take charge of a club constantly vying for honours			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes he has the ability to manage one of @entity24 's top sides @entity0 , pictured with @entity25 , feels he could do a better job than some of his rival managers @entity0 harbours no thoughts of leaving @entity1 in the near future , but maintains he would acquit himself better than some of the managers currently employed by the @entity4 's trophy - chasing sides			1
' i look at the top teams and feel i could do that job better than i 'm seeing it being done , ' @entity0 told @entity39 's @entity38 programme			0
' but i 'm quite happy where i am and if i work in this part of the league for the rest of my career i will be extremely happy			0
' i 'm really happy here - i do n't really want another job , ' he added			0
' in a way the ( @entity1 ) board have been lucky because even if i have great success here i wo n't be looking to jump away			0
' the @entity1 manager , pictured with @entity50 , has said he is not looking to jump ship @entity52 will provide a stern test of @entity0 's managerial ability when they visit @entity6 on monday and @entity0 hopes his side 's teamwork can overcome the considerable technical ability of @entity59 's star - studded line - up			1
' mr @entity59 's options on the bench will be significantly stronger than my own to try and get a result in the game with 15 minutes to go			0
' but it does n't always work out like that , ( as ) @entity66 proved to @entity52 it is about sometimes the team being stronger than the individual and on monday night we hope that 's the case for @entity1			1

@entity0 claims he has the ability to manage the league 's top sides
however @entity0 insists he is *content* with life at @entity6
the @entity1 host @entity4 *holders* @entity52 on monday night
