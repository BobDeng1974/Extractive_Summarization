this weekend sees the return of one of @entity2 ’s finest – @entity4 super-bantamweight world champion @entity3			1
i ’m a fight fan and one of the bouts i would love to watch is @entity3 against @entity8			1
like other fight fans , i also want to drive the politics out of this sport and make it happen because after this weekend ’s test , when @entity3 faces a tough defence against @entity14 , i want to make a huge fight for him			1
we are already in discussions with the likes of @entity20 , the @entity22 world champion , and @entity23 , the @entity24 champion , because @entity3 will move on to a great fight , whether it involves @entity8 or not			1
for fight fans : @entity3 ( right ) and @entity8 ( left ) is a bout boxing 's faithful deserve to see happen in defence : @entity14 ( right ) is on a four - fight winning run and is a possible banana ski for @entity3 i am doing what i can behind the scenes			1
after increasing my substantial offer to @entity8 at the end of last year , we are still no closer			1
that is because of the politics of boxing and they have a habit of cropping up			0
do n’t get me wrong , i ’m blessed to be in a job like this but it does have a tendency to kick you in the nuts			0
the rollercoaster of matchmaking meant that @entity3 ’s original opponent for this next fight , @entity54 ’s @entity53 , pulled out			1
he had visa issues which required a trip to his embassy and a submission of fingerprints , which he failed to do			0
we looked at various options within the @entity4 rankings and @entity14 looked a good , credible fight			1
he was already in the country because he has been sparring with @entity66			0
he has looked devastating on his other fights here , including stopping @entity68 twice for the @entity70 bantamweight title and he also stopped @entity71			2
he has also won an @entity73 world title and is on a four - fight winning streak			1
he is dangerous and awkward , a complete style change to @entity53			0
that is a massive test for @entity3 , challenging his intelligence and his training to see if he can adapt accordingly			1
it is a potential banana skin			0
this is a sterner test than @entity53			2
in terms of what will happen if @entity3 comes through this , i am considering the options			1
i understand that @entity8 ’s agreement with another broadcaster restricts him from fighting on @entity89			2
that ’s the politics we talk about in this sport			0
i will do what i can to make it happen			0
@entity8 has talked about options we would request - not true			2
as a voluntary challenger , i would be willing to have just a rematch clause and , if @entity8 beat @entity3 , we would do the rematch in @entity101			1
so , what is the problem ? it ’s a chance for both fighters to make huge money and a fight that the @entity2 public want to see			1
alternatives : @entity110 's @entity23 - along with @entity20 - are other possible @entity3 opponents i do n’t think for one minute that @entity8 is afraid – both these guys are warriors			1
i just want to get it done			0
this is a chance for both to make a huge amount of money in a division where there are not many big - money fights			2
@entity8 has his eyes on @entity121 , who has just had his mandatory defence			1
i do n’t believe @entity121 will fight him next , or even this year			2
as it happens , we are talking with @entity121 ourselves about a fight and i think it ’s more likely he will have a unification bout with @entity3 than a fight with @entity8			1
where does that leave @entity8 ? i think there will come a point where @entity135 need to look at what is out there and , if they want it , there is a shot at @entity3 ’s title waiting for them			1
i am sick of these great fights not happening so i am on a mission to make this one go ahead			0
a fair bit has happened since my last column – we signed @entity148			2
just a few years ago his profile was huge , but i think he has fallen off the radar since he lost that tight decision against @entity152			2
he is what i call a buzz fighter – he is someone who needs his mojo to be firing and needs a crowd to perform			0
i think fighting in front of small crowds just was n’t giving him that buzz			0
let ’s see how he likes 80,000 at @entity161			2
@entity148 has a real tough test in @entity163 and , if he comes through that , he will fight the winner of @entity166 and @entity152			1
motivation wo n’t be a problem for him			0
bring back the buzz : @entity148 will have no problems finding motivation when he fights at @entity161 mojo sapper : @entity148 ( right ) may not have fully found his potential since that close points loss to @entity152 ( right ) we ’ve had some good news			1
i can confirm we have an extra 20,000 tickets for @entity179 and i will announce next week how you can buy them			1
it will be one of the most spectacular events in boxing history			0
great expectations : an extra 20,000 tickets will be released to see @entity166 and @entity152 at @entity161 rematch : @entity152 lands a left on @entity166 's chin in his controversial loss in @entity191 in november last year @entity192 fights @entity193 in @entity191 on saturday on the undercard of @entity195			1
it is a city divided – crolla from the red side and @entity193 from the blue side			0
@entity192 is on a great run and is almost ready for a world title fight and @entity193 is on his way back			2
what has @entity193 got left ? he looks in better shape than ever			0
and i believe @entity192 is hugely under - rated on the world stage – he may look like a male model and be one of the nicest guys in the sport , but i think you will see a spiteful edge from @entity192 in this one			0
manchester derby : the undercard for @entity217 features locals @entity192 and @entity193 these two used to work each other ’s corner but i am starting to notice a bit of needle			0
this could be a special fight and i ca n’t call it either way			2
i like the idea of @entity227 eventually fighting the winner			0
speaking of @entity227 , i am looking at getting him back out on june 27 in @entity229			0
i am looking at the @entity22 route and ultimately a shot at their champion , @entity232			2
we will pick an opponent who will put us in position for him			0
@entity238 is a fight i am looking at – we have made them an offer and @entity243 fans can expect a great card – with another big domestic clash made yesterday			1
next challenge : @entity227 could face the winner of @entity192 and @entity193 , but @entity232 is the ultimate aim four hours and 10 minutes for the marathon			0
i ’m in bits .			0

@entity3 and @entity8 is a fight i and fight fans want to see
@entity4 super-bantamweight champion @entity3 is one of @entity2 's finest
@entity257 is a chance for both fighters to enjoy a big *payday*
@entity14 will be a tough title defence for @entity3 on saturday
@entity148 will relish @entity161 and has a real test in @entity163
20,000 more tickets will become available for epic @entity166 and @entity152 fight
