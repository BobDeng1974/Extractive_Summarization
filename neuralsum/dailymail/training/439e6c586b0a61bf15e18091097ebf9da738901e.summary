@entity48 's simplest idea was to reuse the whole mat by turning it into a lining for a drawer			2
making a coaster is also an easy option according to @entity19 , who says they are ' perfect for absorbing the perspiration of an ice - cold glass of water - cut to a size that works for your glasses and you 're done '			2

' we recommend using paper bags to create a templates , ' she advises			0
' trace onto the yoga mat using a coloured pencil , and cut ! ' if you want to attach , punch a hole on each side and use string , shoelaces , or ribbon			0
