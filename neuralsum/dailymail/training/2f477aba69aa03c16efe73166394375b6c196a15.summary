by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 14 january 2013 a mother has lost 12 stone in nine months after her children begged her to take control of her weight			1
@entity6 , 46 , shrunk from a size 32 to a size 14 after her son @entity9 came home upset that she did n't look like other mothers			1
her daughter @entity12 , 25 , was also concerned her mother 's weight would restrict @entity9 's upbringing , and he too would be bullied as she had been as a child			1
at her peak , @entity6 , from @entity17 , weighed 25st 10lb			1
she says she was so big that people did n't realise she was pregnant with @entity9			1
@entity6 was nearly 26 stone when her children begged her to lose weight			1
she has since lost more than 12 stone and now runs regularly she told @entity23 : ' i have never been skinny , but over the years , because i was happy and " comfortable " , i just piled on the pounds			2
' chocolate was my biggest downfall – i got through a few big bars of @entity28 a day			2
any junk food i opened , i had to finish			2
‘ i was basically in total denial – it was the story of my life			1
i became a hermit of my own making , never seeing what other people saw			2
' maybe that was because i never looked below my neckline in the mirror			2
as stupid as that sounds , it ’s true			0
@entity6 , who now weighs 13 stone , with daughter @entity12 and son @entity9			1
she says chocolate was her biggest downfall			0
' i got through a few big bars of @entity28 a day			0
any junk food i opened , i had to finish ' ‘ i ’d tried loads of diets , but even if i lost weight , i would always put it back on – and some			2
' over the years , @entity6 's family had voiced their concerns about her weight and her health - she was often breathless and suffered from sore knees			1
' i refused to go to social events that would put me in situations where my weight would be the topic on everyone ’s lips			2
' and instead of listening to my husband @entity62 when he was trying to help me , i would just bite his head off by saying : “ if you do n’t like it , you know where the door is ! ” ' he was just worried about me , but i always had to retaliate			0
i think the amount of weight i had to lose just seemed so much that it was a mountain i did n't think i could face climbing			1
the turning point came when @entity6 ’s daughter @entity12 sat her down to voice her fears about her mother ’s health			1
@entity6 's daughter @entity12 says she was bullied at school for having the ' fat mum ' and did n't want her brother @entity9 to suffer a similar fate @entity6 says she often felt breathless and had sore knees due to her weight ‘ she said she did n’t want @entity9 to feel the same way she had growing up – not being able to join in with normal activities a child should do			1
‘ growing up she was the one in the class that could never go to swimming parties as i would never go in the pool with her			0
she was also bullied at school for having the " fat " mum			1
' we could n't do the simplest of activities such as going to the park due to me being short of breath or as the mother - daughter shopping trips that she watched all my friends doing			1
' to add to her guilt , the next day @entity9 came home from school and dropped his own bombshell			1
' he came in and said : " @entity107 , why ca n’t you look like other mummies ? ” @entity6 and @entity12 now exercise together regularly and say they have a much closer relationship ‘ it quite honestly broke my heart			1
i was in pieces and something inside me just switched and i thought “ this really needs to happen ”			0
at this point , @entity6 had been a member of her local @entity118 gym for a year , having been bought a membership the year before by her mother			1
@entity6 says : ' i would go , but make any excuse to do as little as i could			1
i would also convince myself i had " exercised " – and that gave me a right to eat what i wanted - even if i 'd just done five minutes of walking			0
‘ my confidence was also so low that i had the constant fear of everyone staring at the fat lady on the treadmill			0
‘ now i know that most people do n’t give two hoots about other people in the gym – we ’re all there for the same reason			0
' but on 1st august 2011 , @entity6 took the bull by the horns and began her exercise programme			1
' i decided to get a personal trainer to kick me a kick start , ' she says			0
' he asked me " what do you want to achieve " , and i said “ i just want to look normal ” – the last time i had looked normal was when i was a teenager			0
’ her initial sessions with @entity150 , her personal trainer , were ‘ very hard work ’ , involving a combination of walking and the bike			0
she then went on to have three sessions a week			2
‘ he never put me on a diet – he just gave me tips on how to eat healthily			0
there was no crash dieting as i just knew that would n’t be sustainable in the long term			0
‘ i lost two stone straight away because i was so big , then around one stone a month			0
’ @entity6 with her mother - who initially bought her the gym membership			1
for the first year , she admits she was in denial and would go for just five minutes each time @entity6 now weighs 13 stone and due to exercising three times a week , had also managed to keep the weight off			1
' that has actually been much harder than losing the weight , ' she says			2
now i see @entity150 just once a week and the rest i do myself			2
' but i must stress you have to be in the right place when you start something like this - the reason i think i was so successful is because i really wanted it			0
' over the past year and a half i have seen the gym in a new light - i never believed walking through that door would change my life like it has			0
but thanks to @entity150 i am now half the woman i was			0
last year i went to a party and some of my old school friends did n’t recognise me			2
' @entity6 says she now feels terrible guilt for what she put her family through			1
her daughter @entity12 , who encouraged @entity6 by going to the gym with her , said : ‘ my mum has been a “ big ” woman for as long as i can remember			1
‘ she is such a loving , caring and giving human being but when i was growing up her large frame altered my ' normal ' upbringing			0
‘ i was never deprived of anything that i needed but what she gave in love she lacked in other areas			0
@entity6 says she is ' truly a new person			1
not only by the way i look but also my confidence is sky high , from the woman who always looked at the floor , i now hold my head high ' ‘ the final straw was one year ago when my brother came home from school and said : “ mummy , why do n’t you look like the other mummy ’s ? " i could no longer stand the thought of my mum making my brother suffer the same fate that i did			1
' i sat her down and told her my worries about her health and what my brother will miss out on should she not do anything about her weight			2
' since that day she has never looked back and watching her go from a size 32 to a 14 has been amazing			1
‘ she has lost more than my total weight and my brother ’s height in inches			1
as a result we are a lot closer ; we now workout together , we go shopping any chance we get and to top it all off my brother has never missed one swimming party			0
i ’m one very proud daughter			2
’ @entity6 agrees her weight loss has boosted her relationship , with @entity9 , too			1
' we now go to the park , swimming and race along the road together			0
last year i did a 5k run in 40 minutes – there ’s no way i could have done that before			0
‘ i can truly say i am a new person , not only by the way i look but also my confidence is sky high , from the woman who always looked at the floor , i now hold my head high			0
‘ the other day i caught sight of myself in the gym and did n’t recognise myself – there was someone normal staring back at me			0
i ’ve basically lost a whole person in weight			2
' my only regret is i never did this earlier			0
i am ashamed of myself before and feel i was very selfish towards my family			0
for that , i truly apologise to my loved ones			0
