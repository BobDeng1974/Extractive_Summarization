a 15 - year - old boy accused of helping the alleged killer of two female police officers claims he 's innocent			1
the boy was held on suspicion of assisting @entity4 after officers swooped on his school on friday			1
he was interviewed for six hours before being bailed and is due to be questioned again next week			0
the boy was arrested at 2.30pm as he sat in a class at his school , in @entity35			2
he was handcuffed in the corridor in front of stunned classmates before being taken away by three plain - clothes officers			1
the boy told the @entity41 that he could n't understand why he 'd been arrested			1
@entity4 will spend the weekend at @entity43 ’s infamous @entity42 ( above )			1
his police van sped him to the jail only a mile away from the magistrates court in central @entity43 that he appeared before this morning			1
the judge told him he would be remanded in custody and will appear at the crown court on monday , where he could ask for bail			1
its famous design has a central snowflake shaped building , with two blocks and ten wings of cells running from it with a famous giant watchtower rising upwards			0
it has housed various infamous killers who have appeared at @entity63 and were remanded in custody there to await trial			2
@entity67 , the @entity67 was held there as was ‘ dr death ’ @entity71			0
@entity42 has more than 1,200 prisoners and was originally built in 1868			0
it was also one of the first in @entity11 to have permanent gallows , used to hang more than 100 people up until 1964			0
many were buried in the grounds of the prison in unmarked graves			0
much of the prison was damaged or destroyed during riots by inmates there in 1990 ( above ) between april 1 and april 25 almost 150 and 47 prisoners were injured - including one death among the prisoners			2
it needed £ 80m of @entity89 cash to rebuild it and @entity42 was then renamed @entity91 , @entity43			2
he added : ' i was scared			0
i did n't know what was going to happen to me and i still do n't know why they 'd want to arrest me			0
' the boy 's father added that he wanted to ' get to the bottom ' of why he 'd been arrested			1
assistant chief constable @entity98 , of @entity99 , said : ' we have arrested a 15 - year - old on suspicion of assisting an offender			1
' this remains a complex and sensitive investigation and we continue to ask the public to search their conscience and urge anyone who has any information to contact us			0
' in court on friday , there were only a few paces between the door to the cells and his place in the dock , but @entity4 still managed to walk them with a swagger			1
five policemen stood so close to him they were almost touching , and four more carrying sub-machine guns watched him constantly from the well of the crowded court			2
this was the one - eyed murder suspect ’s first appearance before a judge after being arrested over the savage deaths of two policewomen			1
he marked it with a yawn			2
it happened just before the first mention of pcs @entity31 and @entity31 in the charges that were being read to him			1
he glanced around the room with his one good eye			0
every police officer stared back			2
in one of the biggest security operations ever mounted for a magistrates ’ court appearance , the man whose face had appeared on wanted posters and billboards around @entity43 was finally seen in public			1
he had a full beard now and looked considerably thinner than in that now - familiar photograph			2
the false eye was the same – an onyx one in his left eye socket , giving him a pronounced squint			0
in a tight - fitting , dark blue sweatshirt and tracksuit trousers , he had the appearance of a bodybuilder – but compared to the burly officers who surrounded him behind half inch - thick glass in the dock , he looked tiny			1
there was a seat in the dock and he went straight towards it and sat down			2
instantly , the judge told him to stand			0
he spoke only once to confirm his name and date of birth and stood mostly with his unshackled hands folded in front of him			0
two minutes later , it was all over			0
the comparatively low - key performance of the man accused of two murders that horrified the nation was in dramatic contrast to the operation deemed necessary to bring him to @entity183 magistrates			2
the two policewomen were mown down in a gun and grenade attack on tuesday , and police had already said they could not rule out the possibility that more grenades were in criminal hands in the city			0
so on a dark , miserably wet morning , roadblocks were set up around the court building and officers carrying @entity196 carbines took up positions inside and out			0
a heavily - armed convoy brought him to court in a van more than two hours before he was due to appear			1
meanwhile in a tiny courtroom on the fourth floor , every seat was taken			0
among those in the public gallery was a young man wearing a grey jacket bearing printed portraits of @entity211 , another of @entity4 ’s alleged victims , above the words ‘ @entity214 ’			1
driven : police officers stand guard as @entity4 arrives in an armed convoy to face charges of murder and attempted murder visitor : @entity222 , widow of @entity223 and mother of @entity211 , was in court while another family member wore a hoodie with a tribute to @entity214 on it sitting alongside him was @entity222 , widow of @entity214 ’s father @entity223 , who is also alleged to have been killed by @entity4			1
neither of the pcs ’ families attended , according to court staff , and if any of @entity4 ’s relatives or friends were in court , none was identified			1
downstairs , two officers with sub-machine guns , flak jackets and black armoured outfits monitored everyone coming through the security search			0
even inside , they wore their jet black protective glasses			0
in a scene rarely witnessed in @entity11 , four officers brought their weapons into the courtroom and stood guard			0
whatever unseen arrangements were made to get the defendant securely into the dock , it took more than five minutes to put them into operation after district judge @entity260 ordered him to be brought			0
proud : father @entity262 hugs pc @entity31 - who was murdered last tuesday in a gun and grenade attack victim : @entity31 , left , with partner @entity267			1
the couple were planning their civil partnership ceremony convoy : @entity4 , held in the police van with the blue roof , was swept quickly out of court after his hearing with huge police protection custody : @entity4 was driven to the nearby @entity42 , where the gates were already open , allowing the van to speed straight into its huge complex where he will be held until monday @entity4 was charged with four counts of murder and four of attempted murder			1
apart from the killing of the two pcs , he is accused of killing @entity211 at the @entity287 in @entity288 , @entity289 , on may 25 and his father @entity290 in an attack at his home in @entity293 , @entity43 , on august 10			1
he is further accused of attempting to murder @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 , who were in the pub at the time ; and @entity298 on august 10			2
the judge ordered him to be remanded in custody and to appear at @entity301 on monday			1
a police convoy duly took him to the city ’s @entity42 jail to await the next stage of what is likely to be a lengthy legal process			0
ten miles away on the @entity35 estate where @entity31 , 32 , and @entity31 , 23 , fell , forensic officers were still working at the scene			2
the floral tributes and messages of condolence continued to arrive			0
