it has been another difficult week for @entity1			1
a last - minute equaliser conceded in the @entity4 derby followed by a @entity6 defeat to @entity7 has put the club in the spotlight			1
since losing in @entity11 , players have been questioned and @entity12 has been scrutinised , as have @entity1 ’s dealings in the transfer window just gone			1
amid all that gloom , though , is one shining light : @entity17			1
so on friday morning , when i saw the back page of this newspaper , i was sent into a rage			2
a headline reading ‘ @entity24 fight to keep @entity25 ’ was not what was needed before a game of huge significance for @entity1			1
if @entity1 fail to win again , the international break will be an absolute nightmare and the mood will worsen			1
now , before we go any further , i want to make it clear i have no issue about a journalist unearthing a story			2
nor , on a separate matter , do i have a problem with agents trying to get the best possible deal for their clients			0
in both circumstances , people are just doing their respective jobs			0
the reason for my fury was the timing of this particular story			2
whoever has let it be known that @entity17 is in no rush to commit his future to @entity1 has made a massive mistake			1
no thought has been given to the big picture			0
if anyone around me had put out a story like that about me during my career , never mind the day before a game , our relationship would have been over			1
my agent , certainly , would n’t have done anything like that and i would never have allowed that , even if he had wanted to			0
no matter what your job , we all like to see our wages increased but in the 18 years i played for @entity1 , i never put pressure on them or went asking for a new contract , as the club were renowned for rewarding those who made progress quicker than anticipated			1
they still do it now			0
@entity92 ’s new deal is evidence of that			0
video courtesy : @entity96 / @ @entity97 _ @entity92 has committed to the club with the @entity99 forward penning a new five - year deal @entity92 has endeared himself to @entity1 fans since joining from @entity102 last year i regularly signed four - year deals that were ripped up within 18 months , either by @entity104 — @entity1 ’s fabled former chief executive — or his successor @entity106 , when the club felt my performances had improved			1
that was the way it was done			0
had i found myself central to a story like that , i would have been mortified having to face my manager , so how would @entity17 have felt on friday morning when he walked into @entity113 and saw @entity12 before training ? what particularly frustrates is that it is n’t the first time we ’ve seen stories about @entity17 — who has been linked with @entity120 — and his contract			1
he is one of @entity123 ’s finest young players , a star in the making , but he is old enough to have his own voice and put a stop to things like this happening			1
whoever believes it is a good idea to put pressure on @entity1 has failed to understand the emotion of fans			1
there is never a good time for these stories to appear but when your team is losing , the last thing you want to read about is potential problems for your star player			2
it also creates a perception that a player is more interested in money than football , which in turn creates an image			2
part of an agent ’s duty , after all , is to portray his client in the best light whenever he can			2
@entity12 and @entity17 talk in training this week as @entity1 prepare for a vital fixture with @entity40 @entity25 ( right ) ghosts past @entity157 's @entity156 in trademark fashion during the @entity4 derby they have also not grasped just what @entity1 have done for @entity17 since he signed as a 15 - year - old in 2010			1
he and his family have been looked after ; @entity12 , meanwhile , has protected and nurtured him , providing him with the platform to showcase his talents			0
young players should concentrate on playing games , not get distracted by what is going on off the pitch			0
that is why it was heartening to see another young star across @entity173 sign a new contract in the summer without any fuss , how it should be done			2
@entity176 , who is only 20 , may have been linked with @entity177 recently but he has committed to @entity157 and he should not be giving any thought to leaving @entity179 until after the next @entity180 in 2018			0
that message would also apply to @entity17			2
if , in the future , both players feel they want to try a new adventure , it should be when they are 24 or 25 and a team will be formed around them			0
if they were to leave too early , they would simply become pieces in a jigsaw rather than the main building block			0
alongside @entity17 , @entity176 ( right ) is one of @entity99 's brightest stars for the future @entity176 signed a new four - year deal with @entity157 in july and is recovering from a knee injury @entity17 and @entity176 are the two most exciting young players in @entity99 and now is the time for them to repay the clubs that have given them such fantastic opportunities and will continue to guarantee them regular starts			1
continue as they have been and @entity1 and @entity157 will have no hesitation about paying them what they are worth			2
indeed , @entity12 has said that it is only a matter of time before @entity25 , who has three years remaining on his current deal			0
this , to be clear , is not a criticism of the money these young players are being paid — i was on the receiving end of such comments from old pros when i was starting out — and i appreciate we all maximise what we can earn			0
there are , though , ways and means of doing things			0
the best is behind closed doors			0
this week i 'm looking forward to : watching @entity224 take another test the game of the weekend is at @entity227 and you can be certain that both @entity229 and @entity230 will know they have been in a battle			1
when @entity224 moved to @entity233 from @entity234 on transfer - deadline day , i thought it was a good signing but not necessarily one that would take them to the title			1
it looked more like a buy that was made with the future in mind			2
@entity224 , however , was outstanding in the @entity6 win over @entity245 and the good news for @entity233 supporters is that @entity248 has a track record in nurturing promising young forwards into world - class front men			1
the evidence is provided by @entity253 and @entity254			0
@entity224 became the 11th @entity255 to score a @entity6 hat - trick against @entity245 @entity248 has a history with raw but talented strikers , such as @entity253 ( left ) and @entity254 to look at @entity224 ’s physical attributes , he ticks all the boxes			1
he has power and pace , a relentless work - rate and he is the type of forward who will never give a defender a moment ’s rest			0
he will be at @entity229 and @entity230 from the start			1
what he needs to show now , though , is that he has composure in front of goal			0
wednesday night was a positive step			0
his finishing was impressive but holding your nerve when @entity229 and @entity230 are trying to hunt you down is different			1
another big performance , though , and @entity224 will be moving in the right direction			2
here ’s to game 's marvellous characters it was a treat last week to sit and watch the fittingly named @entity286 drama @entity287 about a man called @entity289			1
he was , among other things , @entity291 ’s kit man under @entity292 and , if you have not had the chance to see it , i would strongly recommend that you try and view it on catch - up tv			0
it provides a reminder to all football fans that there is more to clubs than just the players			0
characters like @entity289 make clubs what they are			1
since i retired , i have been asked numerous times about what i miss most			0
the first answer , of course , is running out every week at @entity311 and winning big games for @entity1			2
the story of @entity291 kitman @entity289 ( right ) , played by @entity314 , is a tremendous tale a close second , though , is not seeing people behind the scenes at @entity113 every day : @entity319 and ‘ @entity320 ’ on the gate , @entity322 who worked on reception , @entity325 , our kit man , and @entity328 the masseur			1
you see these people every day and then , in a flash , it stops			0
every club will have people who work away from the spotlight and get no public credit , but they help create the atmosphere and are worth their weight in gold			0
that ’s why it was enjoyable to see @entity289 get that recognition .			2

@entity17 is one shining light in the gloom surrounding @entity1
i was sent into a rage upon reading the headline ' @entity24 fight to keep @entity17 ' in @entity351 ahead of the showdown with @entity40
this is a game of huge significance for @entity1 - if they fail to win again , the mood will worsen
if anyone around me had put out a story like that about me during my career , never mind the day before a game , our relationship would have been over
i ca *n't* wait to see @entity224 face @entity229 and @entity230
and why football needs characters like @entity289 , star of @entity287
