this is the shocking moment a man suffering from @entity2 was bundled into the back of an ambulance after he caused mass panic at a market in @entity7 when he wandered in looking for food			1
the unidentified man walked into a market in the capital @entity12 - which has been badly hit by the worst ever outbreak of the disease - only to be chased from the area by panicked shoppers			1

the world 's worst - ever @entity2 outbreak has so far killed more than 1,500 people in @entity7 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 - where it is believed to have first developed			1
surrounding countries have closed land borders , many airlines have suspended flights to and from the affected countries and seaports are seeing less traffic , restricting food imports to the hardest - hit countries			0
those countries - @entity64 , @entity7 and @entity62 - all rely on grain from abroad to feed their people , according to the @entity79			2
making off with loaves of bread , the man is then chased down the road by men wearing yellow protection suits taking no chances : the heavily protected health workers eventually catch up with the runaway @entity2 patient in one market in the @entity7 capital of @entity12 , the price of cassava root , a staple in many @entity91 diets , was up 150 %			1
' even prior to the @entity2 outbreak , households in some of the affected areas were spending up to 80 % of their incomes on food , ' said @entity101 , who is co-ordinating the agency 's response to the crisis			1
' now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach			0
' the @entity58 has said 1.3 million people in @entity64 , @entity7 and @entity62 will need help feeding themselves in coming months			2
the situation looks likely worsen , @entity111 said , because restrictions on movement are preventing labourers from accessing farms , and the harvest of rice and corn is set to begin in a few weeks			0
unconvinced : the man seems unwilling to leave the area with the medics and starts trying to escape force : unwilling to leave the market the man is bundled into the back of the back of the ambulance by medics stopped : the health workers eventually manage to get the patient into the back of the vehicle before driving off the @entity132 is asking countries to lift border closures because they are preventing supplies from reaching people in desperate need			1
@entity138 decided last night to keep its borders with @entity64 and @entity7 closed but said it would open a humanitarian corridor to allow supplies in			2

as of august 29 , the @entity132 had confirmed 935 cases of the deadly virus in @entity62 - including 380 deaths - though that number is likely to have since risen			0
no escape : the medics cling on to the back of the vehicle as it pulls away to stop the man climbing back out anger : @entity12 residents chase the vehicle down the road as a warning to the man not to return with the @entity2 death toll continuing to rise in @entity91 , new details emerged of next week 's first human trial for virus vaccine			1
so far the most effective treatment for @entity2 appears to have been the experimental drug @entity174 , but this is designed to treat an existing infection , not prevent one			2
the @entity180 @entity179 at the @entity181 is working with pharmaceutical giant @entity182 to develop the drug , which is said to have ' performed extremely well ' in primate studies			0
