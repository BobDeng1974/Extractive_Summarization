thefts from war memorials have more than doubled since last year , with vandals now targeting them at the rate of one every two days			1
campaigners warn action must be taken to prevent the alarming rise , as scores of monuments across the country are being stripped of metal plaques and statues , before being sold as scrap			1
built to preserve the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country , there are an estimated 100,000 memorials in @entity21			2
disgrace : a bronze statue of a @entity24 soldier stood proudly in the garrison town of @entity26 in @entity27 , left			2
however , heartless thieves stole it last week leaving the plinth looking empty , right but ahead of @entity34 , the @entity31 , which works to conserve the nation ’s monuments , is warning that growing numbers are being targeted by unscrupulous criminals			1
@entity37 , the trust ’s director , described the increase in thefts as ‘ alarming ’ and called for greater vigilance			1
‘ there has been a noticeable increase in the amount of thefts reported to us in recent weeks			1
at the end of last year , we were getting reports of one incident a week			2
but in the past six weeks it has been one every other day , which is a noticeable increase , ’ she said			1
‘ it is always shocking when people steal from a memorial			1
we have now lost the last veterans of the @entity57 , and they have moved from living history to historical touchstones			1
no shame : this grainy @entity62 footage shows the moment when two crooks took 40 minutes to remove the bronze statue of a @entity24 soldier from its plinth in @entity26 , @entity27 ‘ these plaques are often the last personal link with some of the fallen			0
if they are lost , and their names forgotten , then it dilutes everything @entity34 stands for			0
’ the trust believe the recent rise in thefts is being fuelled by the soaring price of scrap metal , and growing awareness of the issue , which has resulted in more people contacting them , but also alerting crooks to an easy source of plunder			1
the contempt for @entity21 ’s heroes was highlighted last week , when a bronze statue of a @entity24 soldier was stolen from the garrison town of @entity26 in @entity27			0

support : the @entity94 is a patron of the @entity31 , which has launched a campaign to protect every memorial before the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity57 the trust , which is supported by the @entity94 , has now launched a campaign - called in @entity101 2014 - to protect every memorial before the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity57			1
a @entity103 spokesperson said : ‘ @entity104 has been @entity105 since 2007 and continues to support the trust ’s important work			0
’ the aim is to mark every one of @entity21 ’s war monuments with @entity110 – an invisible chemical marker which can be seen under uv light - in a bid to deter thefts			1
the trust will also issue hand - held uv lights to all of @entity21 ’s scrap dealers to encourage them to check if metal have been illegally taken from memorials			0
sir @entity120 , chairman of the @entity121 , said : ‘ as the centenary of the @entity57 approaches , in memoriam 2014 encourages communities to reconnect with their local war memorials and remember the sacrifice that so many people made for their country			1
’ the theft of metal is a growing problem across @entity21 , with the cost to the economy estimated at £ 770 million per year			0
soaring prices for metals like copper , which has seen a threefold increase in value since 2009 , has meant railway lines , phone lines , as well as war memorials and statues , have been targeted by metal thieves			2
currently , all scrap metal dealers are obliged to do is register with the local authority			0
there are also growing calls for a tighter laws on the sale of scrap metal to halt the plunder of memorials , and tougher sentences for those who wilfully desecrate them			0
@entity155 , a @entity157 mp and former @entity159 officer , said : ‘ of course it is a disgrace			0
these are national sacred monuments and their destruction goes far beyond a normal crime			0
‘ scrap metal thefts are a big problem			2
ministers should look at further regulation around scrap - metal dealing , but the best possible solution is crime prevention measures and swingeing sentences for those found guilty of these sorts of crime			0
