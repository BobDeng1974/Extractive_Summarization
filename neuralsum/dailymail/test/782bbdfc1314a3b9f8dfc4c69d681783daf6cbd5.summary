@entity1 's season of frustration looks set to continue as he faces a race to be fit to lead @entity5 ’s attack at @entity6			1
the @entity8 striker failed to train again on thursday as @entity9 stepped up preparations for sunday ’s @entity11 semi-final with @entity13 , meaning @entity1 has n’t been involved in any outdoor work since before the quarter - final replay against @entity16			1
@entity5 still have two more sessions before they travel south but @entity1 , who missed monday ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity19 with tightness in his hip , would have to involved in at least one to stand any chance of starting at @entity6			1
@entity1 faces a fight to be fit for @entity5 's @entity11 semi-final against @entity13 on sunday striker @entity1 was left out of the squad against @entity19 on monday after being taken off at @entity16 it would even appear touch and go as whether @entity1 will be fit enough to make @entity9 ’ 18 - man squad , given how tormented he has been with fitness issues this season			1
@entity5 will give @entity1 every chance to prove his fitness but the signs at present are not encouraging			1
the injury is a continuation of the problem he sustained in the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity37 on march 22			0
@entity1 missed @entity8 ’s games against @entity39 and @entity40 with what @entity8 manager @entity41 called ‘ a small tear ’ in his hip			1
@entity1 admitted last week he will not be back at his sharpest until next season and he will be glad to see the back of this campaign , having missed more than five months with a combination of thigh and calf problems			2
@entity52 could return at @entity6 after seeing out the last game of his suspension against @entity19 @entity5 captain @entity52 holds a ' 96 ' balloon at the @entity57 memorial service on wednesday if , as appears likely , the 25 - year - old is forced to play a minor role , it would leave @entity9 a decision to make with regards his starting line - up , as @entity5 captain @entity52 is available having served a three - match suspension			1
@entity52 , whose 35th birthday falls on the same day as this year ’s @entity11 final , missed several games in february and march with a hamstring problem but when he was fit for matches against @entity70 and @entity37 , @entity9 decided to use him from the bench			2
he will be desperate to play at @entity6 and @entity9 , who will be without cup - tied winger @entity73 , must decide whether to keep faith with his current midfield of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 or alter his system to fit @entity52 back in			2
@entity9 will be without @entity73 who is cup - tied having represented @entity81 in the @entity11 this season @entity79 says playing in these type of games is why he joined @entity5 from @entity70 playing at @entity6 will be a new experience for a number of @entity5 ’s squad and @entity79 says a positive result against @entity13 is required to enhance their development			1
@entity5 are favourites to reach the final but the @entity91 international maintains there is no complacency in the group			2
‘ it ’s the reason you join a club like this — the dream of competing for the top prizes and potentially getting some silverware , ’ said @entity79			0
‘ there ’s a huge incentive for every player here			0
@entity13 had a great result on the weekend so they will be raring to go just like we will be			0
‘ that will make for a great game at a historic venue			0
every single player wants to ensure we get ourselves back there for the final			0
everyone is ready to make that leap			0
we are generally a young squad who are gathering experience and getting better all the time			0

@entity5 face @entity13 in @entity11 semi-final at @entity6 on sunday
@entity1 is suffering with a hip injury and is a doubt for the clash
