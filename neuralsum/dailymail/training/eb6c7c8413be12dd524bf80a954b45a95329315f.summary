by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has complained bitterly about the ' very hurtful decision ' to fine @entity4 for his alleged spat with @entity6 during the first @entity7			1
@entity4 was fined 50 per cent of his match fee by the @entity9 , a sum in the region of Â£ 3,000 , over the fracas reported in the @entity14 pavilion stairwell			1
@entity15 fast bowler @entity6 will face a more stringent punishment - up to a four - test ban - if he is found guilty at a hearing on friday of the @entity19 charge of ' abusing and pushing ' @entity4			1
@entity2 acknowledged , unlike the @entity43 in a press release on friday , that no right of appeal is available for the level 1 judgment against @entity4			1
but he was nonetheless highly critical of the process			0
' to me , it is a very hurtful decision , ' he said			2
' i felt a lot of things were neglected in judging the case			1
' @entity2 stopped short of naming @entity6 , but was otherwise very specific as he put evidence in the public domain at his press conference on the eve of the third test in @entity27			1
clash : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity15 's @entity6 ( right ) were involved in an incident at @entity14 incident : @entity4 ( right ) was found guilty of ' conduct contrary to the spirit of the game ' by the @entity9 at his hearing @entity65 : @entity6 and @entity4 have a frank exchange of views out in the middle on day two of the first test ' i would not like to take any other individual name in this , ' he said			1
' but we started walking and there is an individual who used foul language against @entity4 - and i had to step in the middle and by the time we reached the ropes , i thought the thing had defused			2
' by the time we were through the members ' area , i was ahead of @entity4			2
he was a couple of yards behind me and again something happened			0
' @entity2 insists @entity4 was , throughout , an innocent party			1
' something was said to him , and he just turned to the individual - and after that he was pushed , and he barely gained his balance , ' said @entity2			2
' he turned to see what is happening			0
on the basis of that , he is fined			0
the thing that was told is that it was against the spirit of the game - but what we have to say is that we ca n't ignore whatever has happened			2
limbering up : @entity21 will be looking to build on their lord 's victory when the third test begins on sunday lining up : @entity21 captain @entity2 assesses the pitch at the @entity32 on the eve of the third test ' if somebody is saying something to you from behind and you turn and you look , that is not aggressive			1
' @entity21 will resume the series on sunday , with a 1 - 0 lead , harbouring evident grievances over the way @entity4 has been treated			1
@entity2 added : ' the bat was under his armpit throughout , right from lunch ( being called on the pitch ) until he entered the dressing room and not one word was spoken by him			2
' i am not lying when it comes to the factual matter			0
i do n't think there was a bit of aggression ( from @entity4 ) and that is the reason i am very hurt by the wording that has been given			0
i think it is very important			0
' @entity21 are frustrated at their inability to appeal against the decision made by match referee @entity128			1
threat : @entity130 will hope to continue his lord 's form , where he took seven wickets in second innings setting : @entity15 trained earlier in the day at the @entity32 in @entity27 ahead of the third test ' that 's the " beauty " of it ... you ca n't really appeal against it , ' said @entity2			1
' the @entity43 and the leaders are working things out , because we are definitely not at all happy with the wording			0
' if we are going into the lobby and we are walking - and if i ask you ' excuse me ' and you turn around , that can be an act of aggression from your side - especially if you have anything in your hand			0
if i push you , or you face me square on , that 's an even worse act of aggression			0
' definitely to me , if i am here to judge , i do n't think @entity4 committed anything			0
it also becomes slightly difficult - because tomorrow , if i ask any of my players ' do n't say a word , we 'll report it to the match referee ' whatever happens , we will get fined 50 per cent			0
' i am better off abusing the guy or whatever , because 50 per cent of my match money has gone on the other guy abusing me			0
