by @entity0 published : 09:16 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 19:16 est , 14 june 2012 the pale blue coffin was so small the pallbearer carried it into church in his arms			2
a steady stream of mourners , many fighting back tears , followed him , all wishing to pay their respects to the boy with no name who was found dumped by a stream			1
the child – no more than a month old – had lain undiscovered , his body wrapped in a fleece , until a dog walker stumbled across him eight months ago in a remote part of @entity20			1
despite extensive inquiries , his parents have never been found			2
tragic : the coffin was carried into the church by a funeral director whilst floral wreaths and teddy bears were laid at the church paying tribute to the ' llittle angel ' and saying ' be at peace sweet child ' tributes : the boy no more than a month old was born full term but was abandoned on the banks of a stream last october so he will lie in a grave with a headstone carved with the words ‘ baby boy found in @entity42 ’			1
despite never knowing the love of a family , however , his passing did not go unmourned			2
the poignant burial was attended by scores of locals at @entity50 ’s @entity49 , @entity42			1
moved by his story , they clubbed together to raise £ 1,000 to pay for the service			2
grief : all members of the community were invited to the funeral			2
the order of service entitled ' funeral service for a baby boy ' was headed by the words : ' celebrate life ' the coffin was carried into the church by funeral director @entity67 , whilst floral wreaths and teddy bears were laid outside paying tribute to the ‘ @entity71 ’ or ‘ @entity72 ’			1
one card read : ‘ be at peace sweet child			2
’ the order of service , entitled ‘ funeral service for a baby boy ’ was headed with the words ‘ celebrate life			1
’ mourners sang the hymn @entity82 , and listened to readings of @entity84 by three local primary school headteachers and a passage from @entity87 10 by detective inspector @entity88 , one of the officers investigating the case			0
detective chief inspector @entity91 , of @entity92 , who is leading the inquiry , lit a candle during the 30 - minute service and @entity97 ’s @entity96 , which featured an appeal to trace the baby ’s family , sent flowers			1
touching : tributes were left by shocked members of the community - @entity20 police are still desperately searching for the family of the boy the service concluded with a rendition of @entity110 , sung by the church choir			1
‘ some cases get to you , and this is one , ’ @entity112 said			0
‘ we will never give up hope of learning how the little boy came to be placed in this remote area			1
‘ it was so far off the beaten track , it could have only been known to someone familiar with the locality			0
‘ whoever did this will remember it every day of their lives			0
it will be immensely traumatic			0
that ’s why it ’s important they get help too , tell us what happened			0
’ she added : ‘ we do n’t know whether he ever lived after birth			0
we do n’t know the cause of death			0
we do n’t want to speculate			0
someone out there knows what happened			0
it is not too late to talk to us			0
we ’ve still got a team working on this case			0
mystery : even his ethnicity remains unknown , although dna and forensic tests continue ‘ we will not rest and leave no stone unturned until we get to the bottom of exactly what has happened			0
‘ the people of @entity42 have clearly been deeply moved and i would like to thank them for pulling together in the face of this tragedy to raise money and offer their services so that this little boy can be put to rest			1
’ a @entity163 council bin bag was found close to the baby ’s body beside two towels , one green and one with a @entity168 motif			1
officers released an image of the fleece which swaddled him , with the emblem of the @entity175 supermarket on it , in the hope it would be recognised			1
they also posted an advert on @entity179 , which has attracted 1,900 views , and a @entity182 video appeal , which has reached more than 2,500 people , but so far nobody has come forward			1
a man of 35 was arrested on suspicion of murder , claiming he had been involved in the death of the infant , but released without charge after detectives concluded he had nothing to do with the tragedy			0
following the service , the reverend @entity193 , vicar of @entity42 , said it provided the community with a chance to ‘ pause , reflect and consider the precious gift of human life ’			1
‘ this potential was not given to the baby boy and so we mourn his passing , but remind ourselves he is held by @entity205 and enfolded in his love , ’ he said .			2

the boy , around a month old , was abandoned on the banks of a stream last october
his body wrapped in an @entity175 fleece was discovered by a dog walker in a remote *rural* area of @entity42 , @entity20
