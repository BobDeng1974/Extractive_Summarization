@entity1 technical director @entity0 believes @entity2 are again likely to lead the way in @entity4 this weekend			1
fears of another season of domination from @entity2 were blown away by a shock , yet deserved victory for @entity10 last time out in @entity12			1
it was the @entity15 marque 's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion @entity18 and team - mate @entity19 will not have it all their own way			1
@entity10 won the second race of the season with victory in @entity12 last month @entity10 saw off the challenge from @entity2 drivers @entity18 and @entity19 in @entity12 in searing heat and high track temperatures the @entity30 of @entity10 and @entity31 were far kinder on their tyres , stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for @entity18 and @entity19			1
this weekend 's race at the @entity37 , however , should favour @entity2 given the cooler climes than that of @entity40			1
@entity41 is certainly not expecting back - to - back @entity1 wins and said : ' our car has a pretty decent cooling package			2
' that allowed us to operate in the fierce temperatures like we experienced in @entity12 without having to open up the car			2
' the track was also rough and hot , which is hard for tyres , and we 're fortunate the car goes well on its tyres			0
@entity18 celebrates his win in @entity54 ' quite what problems were going on in merc - land i do n't know			2
' but i 'm fairly sure we will have our work cut out in @entity4 to do as impressive a job as we did in @entity12			2
' as to whether @entity1 can stay the course with @entity2 and provide a season - long challenge , for now that is too difficult to determine			1
' i do n't know about that			0
i 'll tell you at the end of the season , ' remarked @entity41 with a smile			0
' in @entity70 ( the season - opening @entity54 @entity69 ) @entity2 were very , very dominant , and we were better than we looked			1
' even in free air we would n't have held a candle to them there			0
' there is a lot of work for us to do before we can head into every race weekend confident we can hunt for the victory from the first session of that weekend			0
' but we do have a fairly exciting development plan , and we 've a lot of performance to bring			0
' it should at least be an interesting season to see if we can close that gap so we are genuine contenders at any weekend			0
' crucially , and what may yet be a determining factor , @entity41 added : ' normally over the course of a season being kind to your tyres is the best thing you can be			0

@entity1 won the second grand prix of the season in @entity12
@entity10 's victory was a shock given @entity2 ' strong start
but @entity1 's technical director believes @entity2 will be strong in @entity4
the cooler climate should suit @entity18 and @entity19
