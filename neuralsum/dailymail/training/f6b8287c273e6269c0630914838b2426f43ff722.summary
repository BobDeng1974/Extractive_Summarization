by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 15:24 est , 19 march 2013 bagged salads have been linked to a food poisoning outbreak that could have infected as many as 3,000 people , it has been revealed today			1
details of the contamination , which was caused by the water born parasite @entity7 , were released by the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
the outbreak happened in may last year , however the details of the investigation and the likely source have only been released now			2
spinach sold by @entity16 have been linked to the @entity7 outbreak by the @entity10 the @entity10 have also linked bags of mixed salad , similar to the one pictured right , sold in some @entity22 stores to the outbreak but the supermarket have strenuously denied the claims significantly , the contamination appears to have occurred in bags of washed mixed salad , which were marked as ready to eat			1
the @entity10 said its investigation suggested a statistically significant link to bags of mixed salad leaves sold by the @entity22 chain in @entity33 and the @entity34 , the @entity35 , the @entity36 and @entity37			1
there was also some evidence pointing towards salad spinach leaves sold by @entity16			1
however , the @entity10 said all the supermarkets tend to get their salad leaves from the same suppliers and other retailers may well have been implicated			1
the investigation concentrated on interviewing people who fell ill and looking for common eating patterns			0
no contaminated bags of salad , which have a short shelf life , were found			2
some 300 people , mainly women aged over 20 , reported falling ill with stomach upsets and diarrhoea to their gps			0
however , the @entity10 believes the total number of cases is likely to be ten times higher , with most people simply putting up with the symptoms			0
@entity7 is most often found in water contaminated with animal faeces , such as sheep dung			0
the @entity10 ’s dr @entity62 , who led the investigation , which also involved the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) , said : ‘ our findings suggest that eating mixed leaf bagged salad was the most likely cause of illness			1
‘ it is however often difficult to identify the source of short lived outbreaks of this type as by the time that the outbreak can be investigated , the affected food and much of the microbiological evidence may no longer be available			1
the @entity10 said that 300 people , mainly women aged over 20 , reported falling ill with stomach upsets and diarrhoea ‘ as this was an isolated and short lived outbreak there is no specific action for the public to take but we hope the investigations between the @entity64 and the food industry will help to prevent further outbreaks of this type from happening again			2
’ director of food safety at the @entity64 , dr @entity90 , said she believed this was an isolated incident and that , generally , consumers can trust labels which describe salads and other products as ready to eat			0
‘ we ’d like to remind everyone of our usual advice to wash all fruits and vegetables , including salad , before you eat them , unless they are labelled " ready - to - eat " , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s also important to wash hands thoroughly as well as clean chopping boards , knives and other utensils between preparing raw and ready - to - eat foods to prevent cross contamination			0
’ @entity22 denied any involvement in the @entity7 outbreak			2
it said the @entity10 ’s investigation had come to the wrong conclusion			0
it said : ‘ @entity22 is not the source of this outbreak			1
we have received no complaints of illness and no @entity22 products have tested positive for @entity120			0
‘ @entity22 shares the same supply chain used for its bagged salads with several other retailers , meaning they would also have been affected by this outbreak			2
‘ the @entity10 appears to be concerned with making an eye catching announcement before being disbanded in two weeks ’ time			0
‘ @entity16 also denied any involvement in the food poisoning , saying : ‘ the @entity10 research is statistically flawed and does not prove that @entity16 is the source of the outbreak			1
‘ product safety is our top priority and if we had any serious concerns we 'd act immediately			0
so far this has n't been necessary			0
