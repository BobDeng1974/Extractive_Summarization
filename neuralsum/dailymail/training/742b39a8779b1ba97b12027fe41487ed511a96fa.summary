they may not be able to talk , but babies as young as seven months are able to subconsciously recognise fear in someone ’s eyes , new research claims			1
infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae - in split seconds			1
and they seem to react more in response to fear , than happiness , according to the study			1

and they seem to react more ( stock image ) in response to fear , than happiness scientists from the @entity24 in @entity25 conducted @entity26 ( electroencephalography ) tests , which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes			1
in the first experiment , 24 babies undergoing the tests were shown images of eyes without any other facial features , either reacting fearfully or showing happiness			1
the activity in the babies ’ brains changed more in response to fear than happiness			2
a pair of fearful or surprised eyes ( stock image ) has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions , such as happiness , when they tend to show the smallest amount of white			1
the study claims that babies read this cue in just 50 milliseconds and react to fear stronger than happiness @entity56 are the whites of human eyes			1
experts believe they evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking , because direction is linked to emotional states			2
women ’s brains have more hardwiring than men ’s to read emotions and one consequence is that women have more white in their eyes than men			2
the study reveals that babies subconsciously recognise fear in someone 's eyes by looking at the sclerae for under 50 milliseconds			1
a pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions , such as happiness , when they tend to show the smallest amount of white			1
we are the only primates to have sclerae			0
for example , apes ' are completely dark			0
apes ' lack of sclerae mean that their prey does n’t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success			0
the same result was seen in a second experiment when 22 babies were shown sclerae when the gaze was direct rather than averted			0
in each experiment , the images were presented for just 50 milliseconds , which is beyond the threshold of conscious perception , according to the study published in the journal @entity109			0
a pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions , such as happiness , when they tend to show the smallest amount of white			1
it is thought that the human eye ’s prominent white sclera is important in social interactions			0
while scientists have previously found evidence for brain mechanisms that allow for the unconscious detection of eye cues in adults , they did n’t know how early in development this ability emerges - until now			0
‘ the current study provides neural evidence for the unconscious detection of emotion and gaze cues from the sclera in seven month - old infants , ’ said dr @entity128 , of the @entity24			2
‘ our findings demonstrate the existence of fast , efficient and reliable social cue detection mechanisms in the human infant brain that likely provide a vital foundation for the development of social interactive skills			0

while apes may miss out on this extra communication tool , their lack of sclerae mean that their prey does n’t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success			0
