in the incredible @entity10 video , 81 - year - old @entity8 looks like she is clinging onto the plane ’s door as if she changed her mind about the jump at the last minute			1
however the thrill seeker has spoken out to say that she was n’t forced out of the plane – as the footage appears to show but that her her knees gave way			0
the tandem diver grasps her tightly as they plummet towards the ground at 125mph daredevil : @entity8 , 81 , has spoken out insisting that she did want to jump out the plane - in the video she appears to have been pushed ' no , i do n’t look at it that way , ' said @entity8 when asked if she was pushed out the aircraft			1
' [ the instructor ] knew how bad i wanted to jump			0
' @entity8 , who admits to seeking out excitement , surprised her family when she announced that she wanted to jump out of a plane to celebrate entering her ninth decade			1
' they thought i was very brave , ' @entity8 , from @entity44 , @entity23 , told @entity46			1
' but , it ’s just something i ’ve wanted to do for a long time			0
' and she fulfilled her wish at the @entity51 last may			0
however the dive itself , which was all caught on camera then posted on @entity10 by @entity8 's sister , did not go as smoothly as expected			1
after her harness came loose @entity8 was left precariously dangling from her instructor as she hurtled towards the ground at 125mph			1
furthermore , the daredevil could not see what was happening as her shirt flew up covering her face			0
' the upper harness came off , you know			2
just slipped down , it was just the lower harness , is all i had			2
' high spirits : @entity8 , 80 , the tandem skydiver , said it was her first ever jump as she is filmed before take - off			1
she said she had been planning the leap for a decade smiling : @entity8 looks at the camera as the plane makes it ascent in preparation for the jump in the dramatic video , which has been seen more than 92,000 times on @entity10 , the woman 's tandem diver can be seen clinging onto her safety harness which had slipped down her legs during the jump in @entity23			1
as they plummet towards the ground , the woman 's top flies up exposing her back to the high - speed winds			1
the cameraman - a separate jumper filming the whole experience - comes over to help as the pair get into difficulties			2
just before the jump happened , the woman appears to yell ' no ! ' - telling her instructor to stop her getting out of the aircraft			2
struggle : after making the ascent , the woman apparently decided she did not want to make the jump which she had been planning for the last decade jump : with the woman appearing to resist , she plunges out of the plane			0
a @entity102 parachute expert said the problems started because they were in the wrong position when they left the aircraft it was her first skydive , which she had been planning for a decade , she says on the video which was published on @entity108			0
' she was very close to slipping out , ' he said			0
' you can see from the video the instructor was trying to get to the harness and cling on to it			2
the person with the video camera was also trying to help			0
' the @entity117 confirmed it is now investigating what went wrong with the dive			0
at the end of the video the woman can be seen on the ground apparently uninjured but is seen being given some careful attention			2
even the instructor is traumatised and has to be consoled by a colleague			0
parachute jump : the woman , 80 , and her tandem diver leap from the plane over @entity23			0
shortly after leaving the aircraft , they would have been travelling at 125mph descent : the separate parachute jumper videoing the jump captures the moment they tumble out of the aircraft descent : they plummet towards the ground - but problems quickly start as the woman 's harness slips difficulties : the instructor clings onto the woman 's harness as they get into trouble freezing : the woman 's back is completely exposed to the elements and rushing wind as her jacket top flies up during the fall difficulties : the tandem skydivers hold on to each other as they fall towards the sun - scorched @entity23 earth topple : rather than being strapped together , the two jumpers ' legs are both pointing in different directions comforting : the instructor , left , and the woman jumper , 80 , right , are helped after they made a successful and safe - landing in @entity23 watch interview here video : the woman leaps two minutes into the footage			1
