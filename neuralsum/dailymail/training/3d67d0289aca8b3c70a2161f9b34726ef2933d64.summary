@entity0 let out a huge sigh of relief before reflecting on one of the most topsy - turvy football matches he has presided over for years			1
two sets of 90 minutes , 30 minutes of stoppage time and even the first 16 penalties could not separate @entity5 and @entity6 in a magical example of @entity9 third - round action			1
then , eventually , finally , dramatically goalkeeper @entity13 stepped up , threw off his gloves and struck the decisive penalty to win it 9 - 8			1
@entity0 gestures furiously on the touchline during the @entity9 third round replay on tuesday goalkeeper @entity13 celebrates after scoring the winning penalty for @entity5 at @entity20 @entity13 is surrounded by his team - mates as @entity5 celebrate a famous victory on penalties ' unbelievable , ' was the first word @entity0 could muster afterwards			1
' it 's a long time since i 've experienced those kinds of highs and lows in one match			2
attractive football from both teams			2
' both teams went out and tried to win it			2
we got what we deserved , no doubt about that			0
it was a fantastic cup tie , absolutely everything you can imagine was in it			0
' passions threatened to spill over in extra time when @entity47 started finger - pointing at his own team - mate @entity48 and the pair had to be separated by @entity50			1
' it was handbags , ' @entity0 reasoned			0
' they 're such big buddies you 'd find it difficult for them but they must 've been passionate about something			0
obviously one opinion was disagreed by the other one			0
' i do n't know what it was but there 's no doubt it will not hang over us after we 've won			0
' @entity5 pair @entity47 ( centre ) and @entity48 argue with each other during extra time @entity47 ( second right ) and @entity48 ( right ) square up to each other as tensions rise on tuesday night centre - back @entity70 was commanding at the back and would 've been man - of - the match had it not been for @entity76 coming from the bench to change the game , scoring the late free kick to level the game , after @entity81 put @entity5 ahead , and setting up @entity82 in extra time for a tap - in			1
that was still not enough when @entity86 came on and forced in an equaliser			0
' @entity70 nearly did n't play , ' @entity0 revealed			0
' he was feeling his calf a little bit and @entity90 was not available with injury			0
' in a recent interview with @entity93 , @entity13 explained why his cool finish to the tie was perhaps not such a surprise to him			1
' i was an outfield player before i was a goalkeeper , ' he said			2
' i played up front until i was 10 and i loved to score goals but when my under 11 team @entity101 lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked : ' who wants to go in goal ? ' i said i did n't mind while we looked for a new keeper â€” 18 years on i 'm still in goal ! ' @entity13 scores the penalty that seals victory for @entity5 in the third round replay @entity6 goalkeeper @entity112 ( right ) can do nothing to stop @entity13 's penalty hitting the back of the net a clearly devastated @entity117 was left frustrated with referee @entity118 for only awarding a free kick when @entity76 appeared to be fouled in the box by @entity48 with his side 2 - 1 ahead			1
' it 's just disappointing that @entity76 was given a free kick outside box and clearly it 's in the box , ' the @entity6 manager said			1
' there is no justification how the referee has not seen it			2
the linesman should 've seen the action in the box			0

goalkeeper @entity13 scored the winning penalty for the @entity5
@entity47 and @entity48 fell out with each other during extra time
