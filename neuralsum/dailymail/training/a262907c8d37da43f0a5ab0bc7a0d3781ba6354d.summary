could your toothpaste be harming your health ? that ’s the very real concern of a growing group of dentists who believe that far from being an essential part of our daily regimes , many commercial toothpastes contain substances detrimental to our health			1
these chemicals have been linked to possible oral and breast cancers , neural and cardiac ailments , as well as mouth irritations , gum damage and environmental pollution			1
mr @entity19 is a specialist in restorative dentistry and a member of the @entity22			1
after more than 35 years in the profession , he believes the products we find on supermarket shelves are often grounded in industrial chemistry rather than medicine			2
there is a very real concern of a growing group of dentists who believe that far from being an essential part of our daily regimes , many commercial toothpastes contain substances detrimental to our health ‘ the public are smart , but they need to see past the marketing and be well - informed about what they are buying , ’ he says			1
‘ some products use a slogan indicating that they are “ the leading products used by dentists ” , but that ’s because they send free products to every dentist in the country			2
’ here are the ingredients that most concern mr @entity19 ... @entity54 causes mouth @entity55 @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , causes mr @entity19 much concern			1
‘ it ’s in 85 per cent of toothpastes and is used as a wetting agent ( something that allows the paste to spread more easily ) that helps the peppermint oil used for flavouring mix with the water contained in the product			1
without @entity56 , these elements would separate in the tube			2
‘ the problem with @entity56 is that it opens up the gaps between the mucosal — skin — cells in the mouth , which allows toxins or carcinogens to get in [ these can come from all manner of sources including tobacco smoke ]			1
‘ oral mucosa is one of the most delicate tissues in our body and @entity56 is effectively a detergent , ’ says mr @entity19			1
this harsh detergent can cause irritation and abrasions or breaches in the skin inside of the mouth , which cause chronic mouth ulcers			1
‘ if i see a patient suffering with recurrent mouth ulcers , one of the first things i do is prescribe the use of a @entity98 toothpaste , ’ he says			1
dr @entity99 ( pictured ) says ‘ you need to know what strength of bleaching gels we are talking about			2
if the concentration is too high , it will cause problems			2
’ @entity108 attack your @entity109 ‘ whitening uses peroxides and hydrogen peroxide to bleach the teeth , ’ says mr @entity19			1
‘ they are known to be toxic and irritant to all soft tissues			0
‘ they damage the mucous membranes in the mouth and can only cause harm to the surface cells of your gums			1
’ and at the levels and concentrations that are available from over-the - counter products , they often can not whiten the teeth effectively			0
the tiny bits of plastic in your toothpaste ‘ @entity133 are tiny pieces of plastic in some toothpastes that are so small you ca n’t see them even with a microscope , ’ says mr @entity19			1
‘ they act as an abrasive to remove stains from your teeth			0
‘ but they also run through our water treatment centres , get into our water systems and are now finding their way into the food chain			0
these beads are found inside oysters , mussels , lobsters and fish in the @entity155 , the @entity156 and the @entity157			0
their effect is similar to that of plastic carrier bags that find their way into the sea and clog up the eco-system			0
’ despite all these potentially hazardous chemicals , mr @entity19 does n’t advocate binning our toothpastes — mostly because the fluoride they contain has transformed the state of our teeth			1
‘ a little addition of fluoride has made significant inroads to improve dental health and help reduce tooth decay , ’ he says			1
and his sentiments are echoed in the advice from the @entity179 ( @entity179 )			0
‘ use a toothpaste you are comfortable with from a reputable brand that contains fluoride , ’ says @entity180 , scientific adviser for the @entity179			0
‘ we know fluoride works well			0
but once you get into the other ingredients contained within the products , you ’re into finer scientific points			0
this lack of transparency makes it difficult for dentists — let alone consumers — to assess toothpastes			1
dr @entity99 , clinical director of @entity194 and official dentist of @entity196 ’s @entity197 , takes issue with dr @entity19 ’s criticism of bleaching agents , saying : ‘ you need to know what strength of bleaching gels we are talking about			1
if the concentration is too high , it will cause problems			0
’ and , while she agrees with his views on triclosan , she has fewer concerns about @entity56			0
‘ there ’s absolutely no credible research so far that shows @entity56 is linked to mouth cancers , but it is known and has been shown to be linked to mouth ulcers in some people , ’ she says			1
