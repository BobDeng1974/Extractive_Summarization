hopes that @entity2 's new democratic regime would agree to re-open the investigation into the @entity5 bombing have been dashed after officials declared that the case was ' over '			1
however , @entity8 tonight insisted that the probe into the terrorist atrocity that killed 270 people in 1988 remains open			1
the @entity12 disclosed that members of the @entity5 investigation team , including officers from @entity16 , had visited the north @entity18 state this week to look into possible leads which could result in further convictions for the attack			2
but @entity2 authorities now say they do not want to ' dig into the past ' amid fears they could be forced to pay out further compensation to the families of the victims			1
atrocity : the remains of @entity5 , brought down over @entity5 , @entity30 , in a 1988 terrorist attack destruction : the scene in the village of @entity5 , where houses were destroyed by the plane in a statement tonight , the @entity12 said that it expected a follow - up to the investigation team ’s visit ' very soon '			1
' the lockerbie investigation team , including @entity16 , were able to visit @entity42 earlier this week , after the government helped to secure visas for them , ' the statement said			2
' they held initial discussions with @entity2 ministers and senior officials on future cooperation on the @entity5 case and we expect to see follow - up on this visit very soon			2
' the investigation into the @entity5 case remains open and the government continues to discuss cooperation on this case with the @entity2 government			1
' the country 's dictator @entity58 had long been suspected of ordering the attack on @entity5 from @entity61 to @entity62 , but @entity2 did not admit responsibility for the killings until 2003			0
that year , @entity58 apologised for the bombing and agreed to pay out $ 2.2billion ( £ 1.4billion ) in compensation in return for the lifting of @entity70 sanctions			2
@entity71 was convicted of involvement with the attack in 2001 , though he was released from prison on compassionate grounds and died last year			0
@entity8 and @entity77 officials have never believed that @entity71 , who always proclaimed his innocence , acted alone and have long been keen to get their hands on the @entity81 intelligence chiefs whom they hold responsible for the bombing			1
culprit : @entity71 , pictured with @entity84 on his return to @entity2 in 2009 , is the only person who has ever been convicted over the bombing the fall of @entity58 's regime in 2011 raised the prospect that the bombers could finally be brought to justice - officers from @entity16 have visited @entity42 to try and investigate the case afresh			2
but senior officials from @entity2 's new democratic government are reluctant to re-open old wounds by looking into the historic atrocity once more , according to the @entity96			1
' the matter was settled with the @entity58 regime , ' justice minister @entity97 said			0
' i am trying to work on the current situation rather than dig into the past			0
' his deputy @entity105 added : ' @entity8 and @entity77 are asking us to reopen this file			1
but this is something of the past			0
we want to move forward to build a new future and not to look back at @entity58 's black history			0
' confession : dictator @entity58 admitted in 2003 that @entity2 was responsible for the attack revolution : a crowd in @entity42 this week celebrating protests which led to @entity58 's downfall it is believed that one reason the government is unwilling to re-open the @entity5 investigation is that it is worried the families of the victims , who were mostly from the @entity8 and @entity77 , might demand further compensation			1
an anonymous official told the @entity96 : ' we know they want more money from @entity2 and that is why we are being very careful			0
' if @entity2 authorities did agree to investigate the case again they could face a backlash from within the country - @entity58 's decision to pay out in 2003 sparked massive street protests			0
@entity8 police are particularly anxious to talk to @entity139 , a former head of @entity2 intelligence who is currently being held in prison in @entity42 , but they are considered unlikely to be granted access to him			1
@entity58 's downfall after 42 years in power was welcomed by @entity148 leaders as a landmark moment in the @entity150 , but @entity2 's transition to democracy has sometimes been troubled			0
a particularly black moment came in september last year , when terrorists over-ran the @entity77 consulate in @entity156 , killing ambassador @entity157 and three other @entity77 .			0

authorities fear new investigation could prompt demand for compensation
