by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:49 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 26 march 2013 @entity4 managers responsible for poor care or guilty of covering it up should be banned from working in a hospital ever again , @entity2 said yesterday			1
the health secretary unveiled a new blacklisting system under which failed hospital directors would be effectively ‘ struck off ’ and prevented from moving to another job in the @entity12			1
he indicated that the barring regime would prevent @entity15 , the chief executive of @entity17 trust at the time when up to 1,200 died needlessly , from ever running an @entity4 trust again			1
health secretary @entity2 ( left ) told @entity20 that managers who fail patients will be struck off and barred from working in the @entity4 again and @entity4 chief executive sir @entity23 ( right ) who has come under fire but , despite conceding that his failings as a manager contributed to the scandal , mr @entity2 yet again rode to the defence of current @entity4 chief executive @entity23			1
mr @entity2 said mr @entity23 , who headed up the local strategic health authority for nine months at the height of the scandal , could not be held solely responsible because he was in charge of too many hospitals at the time			1
and , controversially , he praised the under - fire @entity4 chief executive for having implemented @entity38 ’s drive to slash waiting times so effectively - despite the fact that the target culture has been blamed for the ‘ culture of bullying ’ which undermined care at @entity45			1
the @entity47 inquiry into poor care at the hospital , which reported last month , recommended that poor managers should be blacklisted and barred from further @entity4 work			1
mr @entity2 said yesterday that he would accept this recommendation			2
scroll down to watch the @entity54 speech a series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at @entity60 he said he wanted to introduce a barring system to ensure that ‘ there is a mechanism in place which prevents unsuitable board level executives and non-executives from moving to new senior positions elsewhere in the system ’			1
ministers are considering whether the barring system could be extended to managers below board level , in a bid to end the ‘ revolving door ’ scandal whereby poor adm the changes announced by health secretary @entity2 do not go far enough , a leading campaigner for changes in the @entity4 said today			1
@entity79 , who set up the @entity80 after her mother @entity81 died at @entity60 in 2007 , said the leadership and the " command and control type management " of the organisation had to change			0
she told the @entity85 : ' i really do n't feel the changes go far enough ... this was a failing from ward to @entity92 , we lost hundreds of people here			0
' i sat through every day of that public inquiry , all the bodies failed , all the bodies had to apologise , and i really do n't think that 's been addressed in this statement			0
' how many more reviews do we need to tell us the one thing that needs to change is the culture that needs to change , the very top , the people that rule the @entity4 , the leadership , that 's what needs to change , and it works all the way down to the front line			2
' we need safe staffing levels and the correct skill mix , that 's the start that 's needed , then we need to look at the training			0
' we need a new leader at the top of the @entity4 , we need a leader that galvanises and inspires the workforce			2
' we 've got staff who do n't want to work for the @entity4 , we 've got patients frightened , older people frightened to go into @entity4 hospitals			1
' this has got to change , and it 's not going to change with this style leadership , command and control , we need much more emphasis on the culture and behaviours of the people within the @entity4 , and that starts at the top			2
' inistrators are given pay - offs to leave but then take on new jobs elsewhere in the @entity4			1
last week the @entity135 revealed that up to 2,200 managers had found another job in the @entity4 after having made redundant since the election			2
most got to keep their pay - offs - many of whom were six figures			0
it also emerged that the head of a health trust which had the highest mortality rate in @entity147 received almost a quarter of a million pounds in severance pay			0
@entity149 was paid the sum despite leaving his post at @entity152 in disgrace			0
a police probe has now been launched into up to 16 needless baby deaths as well as the deaths of two mothers at its hospitals			0
asked whether the former chief executive of the @entity163 trust , @entity15 , would be barred under the new regime , the health secretary indicated that he would			1
mr @entity15 was forced to resign after a damning @entity166 study into death rates at his trust			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s a bit difficult to answer speculatively about an individual			2
‘ but let me say this			0
if you ’re asking me : “ should someone who is responsible for the appalling things at @entity45 be prevented from ever running a hospital again ? ” - yes			2
’ however , despite his criticisms of mr @entity15 , the health secretary continued to stand by mr @entity23			1
he said : ‘ i have an honest difference of opinion with a number of people about @entity23 ’s level of personal responsibility for what happened , but i accept that he was a manager of a system that failed to stop this happening and he shares some responsibility for that			0
‘ the key point in there is that he was in charge of 50 hospitals for a nine - month period when some of the awful things at @entity197 were happening , and nothing in the system brought that to the surface ; nothing in the system forced the managers - not just him but all the managers outside the hospital - to do something about it			2
‘ what today is about is creating the structure to make it impossible for those kinds of problems to happen without being seen			0
’ the health secretary went on to praise mr @entity23 , saying : ‘ i have looked at the evidence very carefully , and i think it is important to say that this is somebody who brought down waiting times very significantly , which has a very positive impact on people ’s care , and has led the charge against @entity221 and @entity220 which is now at its lowest level ever since we started taking records			1
’ in the @entity54 , another @entity225 mp called on mr @entity23 to go over his @entity45 failings			0
@entity227 , mp for @entity228 , told mr @entity2 that one thing missing from yesterday ’s announcement was ‘ accountability ’			0
‘ that must include the resignation of sir @entity23 and also apportion responsibility to those former secretaries of state who were not called to give evidence and who bear a heavy responsibility for not having done the right thing at the right time , ’ he said .			0
