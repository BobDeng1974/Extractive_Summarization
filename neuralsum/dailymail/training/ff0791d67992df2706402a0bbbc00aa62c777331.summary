a rogue @entity9 policeman pretended to be injured in the road so they would help him , but then opened fire on the pair			1
@entity41 reacted swiftly and ' appropriately ' by killing the @entity9 police officer			1
it was one of a string of ' blue on green ' incidents where police officers , supposedly loyal to the @entity9 government , have instead turned their guns on @entity51 soldiers			1
@entity41 , who served in @entity52 , 3rd @entity53 , had gone to the funeral of @entity29 on october 26			2
the next day he was found hanged by his mother at the family home in @entity57 , @entity58			1
sergeant @entity15 , left , and private @entity30 , right , who were killed in the ambush by the @entity9 policeman shot dead by @entity7 but the inquest at @entity24 heard his death was ' inexplicable ' as @entity41 had shown little , if any , signs of distress at what had happened in @entity9			1
@entity66 said her son appeared himself and did not talk about the incident when he returned to the @entity51 in october last year , and it ' never entered my head ' that he may take his own life			2
hours before his death he had spoken to an @entity74 colleague via @entity75 to arrange meeting up and had bought some new army boots			0
and there was nothing troubling him financially or in his private life with girlfriends , the hearing was told			0
the inquest heard private @entity7 had been deployed to @entity9 in april and that he ' thrived in his job ' ( file picture ) major @entity86 told the inquest @entity89 , or @entity7 , @entity7 had deployed to @entity9 in april and that he ' thrived in his job ' before giving details of the fatal incident in @entity35			1
he said : ' it was a shooting that took place that he witnessed , of two of our soldiers that subsequently died , and @entity7 reacted by shooting the shooter			1
' maj @entity86 told the court @entity41 went through a process of risk assessment , monitoring and interviewing to assess his response to what he had witnessed and done			0
he had also gone to @entity104 with other soldiers on the way back to the @entity51 for a period of ' unwinding ' and ' decompression ' with a ' day on the beach ' and beers with his colleagues , the @entity87 said			1
' there were no signs , ' he added , ' in fact there were positive signs , he talked about re-deployment			0
' but @entity41 's father , @entity120 , told the inquest of an incident just a month before his son 's death , which suggested some problems			0
he said : ' he showed signs he was stressed , i have never seen that before , since he was a young lad , arms behind his back , shuffling , looking at the floor			0
' mr @entity7 said he asked his son how he was feeling and told him he had to ' be strong ' and ' shake it off '			2
' he put his hands around me and gave me a kiss , ' mr @entity7 added			2
' he was absolutely in my opinion stressed out			0
he hugged me and said , " @entity136			0
" ' mr @entity7 said his son 's mood appeared to improve in the following weeks and agreed he found his death a ' shock and surprise '			1
' there 's just no explanation , ' he added			0
' it is different from a suicide because the decision to end it all is just not capable of being seen from the evidence heard ' - coroner @entity148 @entity148 , coroner for @entity150 and @entity58 , said : ' he was involved in a truly shocking and potentially traumatic incident in @entity9			1
he did his role apparently admirably			0
he did what he should have done and did not crack up under the stress of that truly shocking incident he was involved in			0
' the @entity74 took appropriate measures afterwards			0
' there is certainly no expectation he might self - harm , and yet he did			2
' mr @entity148 said he would record a verdict that @entity41 died as a consequence of his own actions - not a suicide			1
he added : ' he did what he did , but we have no idea why he did it or what his intentions were			0
' i 'm not going to infer intentions , there would have to be a clear note , there 's nothing of that at all			0
it is different from a suicide because the decision to end it all is just not capable of being seen from the evidence heard			2
' he told @entity41 's parents : ' i 'm sorry i ca n't answer what was going through your son 's mind , but nobody will ever know i 'm afraid			0
