by @entity1 reporter published : 19:36 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 20:14 est , 25 july 2013 teens are shunning drink and drugs for a healthier lifestyle , figures suggest			0
over the last decade , there has been a dramatic fall in the number of 11 to 15 - year - olds who drink , take drugs or smoke , according to new data			1
a @entity16 ( @entity16 ) poll of 7,500 children in @entity18 found that in 2012 , only two fifths had ever drunk alcohol , compared to 61 % in 2002			1
put off : fewer 11 to 15 - year - olds drink , take drugs or smoke than 10 years ago , according to new data			1
pictured are children drinking alcopops ( posed by models ) only one in five children said they had tired smoking , compared with two in five a decade ago			1
and 17 % said they had tried drugs , compared with 27 % in 2002			2
researchers found that the proportion of high school pupils who have tried drinking or smoking is highest in the north - east of @entity18			1
but the proportion of youngsters who had tried drugs was highest in southern regions and lower in the north			1
' it ’s encouraging to see fewer young people drinking but overall there remain worrying trends which we need to tackle , ' said @entity45 , policy programme manager at charity @entity46			0
' those children who do drink are drinking more - one in four drinkers consumes over 15 units per week			1
in addition , the frequency of spirit consumption among girls has doubled since 1990 and they ’re now more likely than boys to have been drunk in the last four weeks			0
' to get to grips with these issues we need the government to introduce a minimum unit price , a targeted measure designed to protect the young and which we know saves lives and cuts crime			0
' campaigners @entity67 , of health charity @entity69 , pictured left , says too many children still take up smoking , while @entity73 of the @entity74 , right , says both parents and children should be educated on the mental effects of drink and drugs @entity73 , head of policy at the @entity74 , added : ' drinking , smoking and taking illicit drugs are all risky behaviours that can lead to both physical and mental health problems			1
' it ’s good news that fewer children are taking these risks , but there ’s still a huge job to do			0
we must continue to educate both parents and children about how substance misuse can negatively impact on their mental health			0
' @entity67 , chief executive of health charity @entity69 , said : ' the continued decline in child smoking shows the importance of having a comprehensive tobacco control strategy			0
' much has been achieved in recent years but still around 200,000 children take up smoking each year			2
the failure of the government to bring forward legislation to implement standard packaging was a missed opportunity to significantly reduce the attractiveness of smoking to children			2
' dr @entity111 , chief executive of the @entity112 , said : ' any evidence which suggests that smoking rates are decreasing among children is welcome			2
however , we must n’t fool ourselves into believing that we are doing enough to combat the damage that smoking does to children ’s health			0
' more than 200,000 children start smoking each year and many are still being exposed to second - hand smoke in the confines of a car			1
legislation such as compulsory standardised packaging for tobacco products and a ban on smoking in cars when children are present are needed in order to ensure we continue to protect the health of young people			0
' a @entity135 spokeswoman said : ' we ’re pleased that fewer young people are drinking , smoking and taking drugs			2
' despite clear progress , we know there ’s more that can be done to support healthy behaviours in young people , including our plans to challenge alcohol manufacturers and retailers to increase their efforts through the @entity148 ; remove displays of cigarettes and tobacco to help young people resist the pressure to start smoking ; and continue educating young people about the dangers of drugs through our @entity155 website and education programmes in schools			0
