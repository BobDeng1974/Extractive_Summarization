@entity0 surveyed @entity2 's right - side and described it as a ' graveyard ' after it was torn apart in the first - half by @entity5			1
the problem for @entity7 coach @entity0 and his boss @entity8 , who was at @entity9 , was that this graveyard shift was manned by four englishmen : @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
like @entity17 and @entity18 , also in the @entity2 team , they had been hoping to deliver the type of display which might catch @entity8 's eye for the right reasons after he had changed his plans and hit the north , rather than go to @entity26			1

spurs defended terribly and were killed off by three first - half goals before completing the game in something of a daze as @entity5 coasted home and it damages their hopes of finishing in the top four and reaching the @entity47			1
@entity48 dubbed it the worst performance since he arrived at @entity51 last summer and promised to examine what went wrong before they return to action against @entity55 on saturday			2
@entity56 buries this chance for @entity5 's opener inside the first 10 minutes despite @entity15 's tackle manager @entity48 ( left ) attempted to change @entity2 's fortunes by replacing @entity13 the @entity2 defence were in disarray as @entity63 has the time to head in for @entity5 ' i am not disappointed with the result but i am worried about the performance , ' said @entity48			1

@entity92 celebrates compounding @entity2 's misery , scoring the third goal at @entity9 ' we did n't deliver a good performance			1
we made a lot of mistakes			0
we never found our way to play and allowed @entity5 to play			1
' @entity13 was hauled off after half an hour and replaced by @entity99 as @entity48 tried to get hold of possession as they were being over-run by @entity5 in midfield			1
' it was not because @entity13 was poor , ' he said			0

@entity14 also came off , early in the second half with a ' knock ' while @entity114 returned for his first appearance since january as a late substitute			0
@entity114 was back in the squad because @entity118 hurt his knee in training , on saturday			2
