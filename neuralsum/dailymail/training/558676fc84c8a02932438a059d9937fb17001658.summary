by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:39 est , 5 december 2013 a grandmother who survived the @entity4 has finally spoken about the horrors of @entity6 70 years after promising a girl she would tell the world what she had witnessed			1
@entity10 , 90 , recalls how on the first night she spent at the death camp in july 1944 a frail teenager crawled over to her and begged ' if you live , please tell our story			1
' four years ago mrs knill took a course in theology and it was during one of the group sessions that she finally revealed she was sent to the concentration camp when she was 20			1

she said : ' the girl told me that her and her sister were going to be experimented on			2
she said they were then going to be gassed and therefore exterminated ' she explains in a new documentary that during a session on her course a group at @entity47 , in the city where she now lives , they were discussing whether the @entity4 was a result of evil or sin			1
the tutor said that ' only a person who was there could answer that question '			2
mrs @entity10 responded simply with ' i was there '			2
for mrs @entity10 it was like the floodgates had been opened and , fulfilling her promise to the unknown girl , she decided to write her memoirs			2
remembering her terrible first night at @entity6 , she said : ' the girl told me that her and her sister were going to be experimented on			1
' she said they were then going to be gassed and therefore exterminated			2
she made me promise to tell the story of the camps , if i were to live			1
' of course i said yes , but after the war was over it did n’t seem right to talk about what had happened			2
' horror : @entity10 spent six weeks at @entity6			1
pictured is the famous inscription ' work makes [ you ] free ' war : holocaust survivior @entity27 as a young girl , including with her mother @entity74 , left death camps : @entity10 was at @entity6 , which comprised two separate camps , for six weeks instrument of death : one of the surviving gas chambers at the @entity6 concentration camps the @entity6 death camps played host to some of the most gruesome @entity85 medical experiments , which few survived			1
professor @entity87 oversaw the mass sterilisation of hundreds of @entity90 prisoners by putting chemicals in their fallopian tubes and exposing their genitals to x-rays			0
the procedures were brutal , often causing infections and radiation burns			0
some ‘ patients ’ were used for human medical trials of the drugs @entity100 and @entity101 , reacting with bloody vomiting and painful diarrhoea			0
other experiments had no apparent purpose and were done merely for practice - or pleasure			0
doctors deliberately made the lungs of tuberculosis patients collapse and killed others by injecting lethal phenol into their hearts			0
one of the most infamous doctors , @entity116 ( above right ) infected different races with contagious diseases to see how their survival rates compared			0
source : @entity122 she said : ' there , you were one of a number , and it came down to how long you could survive			0
' after the camps were liberated , she was too traumatised to tell her story but has finally broken her silence			1
mrs @entity10 , who went on to marry @entity132 major @entity131 , was born in @entity133 but escaped to @entity134 in 1942 when the @entity135 began rounding up @entity90			0
two years later , when mrs @entity10 was 20 , @entity134 was occupied and she was transported to @entity6 where she spent six weeks before being transferred to the @entity137 labour camp @entity138 , which was eventually liberated			1
mrs @entity10 later moved to @entity139 where she had two children , @entity141 , a psychiatrist , 65 , and @entity143 , 58 , a teacher			0

he and fellow students @entity151 , 26 , from @entity154 , and @entity155 , 22 , from @entity156 , made the documentary for a final year project after he read her book in just one day			0
mrs @entity10 said : ' @entity149 has done a marvellous job , and i am very happy with the film			0
it goes some way towards fulfilling the promise i made to the twin all those years ago			0
' @entity149 added : ' it was an honour to work with @entity10			0
she is an amazing lady , and we are really pleased we have helped her keep that promise she made so long ago			0
