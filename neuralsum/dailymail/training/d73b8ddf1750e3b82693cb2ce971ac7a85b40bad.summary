an ' invisible hand ' of social convention is behind the mysterious rise and fall in the popularity which names parents pick for their children , according to a new study			2
while some had theorized that celebrity parents , or even the government , influence whether @entity11 or @entity12 is in for a given year , scientists have found evidence that a more subtle phenomenon is at work			0
according to the academics behind the study , the process of subconsciously trying to fit in with everybody else in a social group always leads to clear winners - even though it is impossible to pick who they are			1
after a series of rounds , a set of most popular names emerged shifting tastes : the authors say their study disproves the notion that institutions or celebrities lead trends like baby naming - which instead happen by themselves scientists from the @entity50 and @entity51 , @entity48 asked a group of people to pick names for a series of faces that flashed in front of them in an online game			1
using small amounts of money , the players were rewarded for picking the same name as others in the group , and penalized for choosing a different one			2
each time the results were different , players of the so - called @entity68 were shown what other users picked , helping to inform their next choice			0
after several rounds of chaos , a few clear winners emerged , and a set of most popular names was born			1
@entity77 , one of the authors , explained the process to the @entity80			0
he said : ' in the very first few rounds , it was just utter failure and no one could match ' ' but then you had a small , minor option that all of a sudden became explosively used by strangers - it just caught on like wildfire , and within a few rounds , was universally adopted			0
' snap ! in the above screenshot from the name game , some players chose the same name as each other , winning a reward , while others were penalized larger groups of people required longer for a consensus to emerge - but the overall trend was the same , according to the study , which was published in the @entity103 academic journal			1
the trend appears to play out as explained on a much larger playing field			0
baby names across all of the @entity107 , compiled from birth records by the @entity109 , follow @entity110 , the co-author of the study , described the phenomenon as ' spontaneous emergence '			1
she said : ' spontaneous emergence is like the existence of an invisible hand			0
' everybody is just trying to agree with their social circle , and spontaneously there will be the emergence of a single consensus			0
' though the theory of spontaneous emergence is not new , the study marks the first time scientists have tested it on a large group - in this case around 100 people			2
as well as the narrow field of baby naming , the findings could can be applied to a much wider array of social conventions , such as changes in language or style			1
trends : the study helps explain why baby names change in popularity			1
above are the top 20 baby names in the @entity107 for three different years - 1990 ( left ) , 2000 ( center ) and 2013 ( right )			2
while some names , like @entity145 , feature in all three , many have dropped away after ten or twenty years			0

recent study showed that trends like baby naming happen spontaneously
tendency of social groups to want to fit in leads to herd - like choices
scientists from @entity48 and the @entity107 asked people to name random faces
were rewarded for picking same name as each other , penalized for not
after several rounds of chaos , a set of clear winners always emerged
helps explain why some names become very popular then fade away
