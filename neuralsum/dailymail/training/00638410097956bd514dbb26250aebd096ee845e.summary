@entity1 's superstrike may have come as a surprise to the watching world , but the @entity5 playmaker had been readying himself for such an opportunity this week			1
footage has emerged of the 24 - year - old trying out a similar technique while practicing @entity11 field goals during training with the @entity13			1
and perhaps @entity15 ' keeper @entity14 would have been wise to check out the vine of his long - range effort before the @entity18 friendly to avoid being embarrassed by the @entity20 midfielder			2
his kick was hard and true - much like his goal against @entity15 , and it seemed to prove that practice makes perfect			0
@entity5 boss @entity37 later said : ' @entity1 's goal ? amazing			2
' they 'll watch it the world over			0
his practice with the @entity13 yesterday paid off ... ' dumped out : @entity1 puts @entity15 's @entity44 on the floor during the friendly in @entity47			0

@entity15 ' keeper @entity14 was stunned by @entity1 's strike
he *lobbed* the ' keeper from inside his own half during *pre* *season* friendly
but video shows he has been practicing the technique during training
@entity1 had a go at hitting @entity11 field goals from 50 yards
while it was im*pre*ssive , the goal was *n't* enough for @entity5 as they lost 3 - 2
