instead she was put through to a call centre in @entity12 only to be asked by a call centre advisor : ' what 's @entity18 ? ' then , when the grandmother tried to explain it was the language spoken by herself and around 300,000 other people in @entity13 , the advisor said : ' i ca n't put you through because i do n't know what @entity13 is			1
' the call ended shortly afterwards			0
mrs @entity14 , a retired council worker , said : ' i just find it incredible that i live in @entity13 and want to be put through to a @entity18 speaking service - yet i 'm put thought to someone employed thousands of miles away in @entity12 who 's never even heard of my home country - or the language			1
' i speak fluent @entity18 , i 'm very proud to be @entity18 and i 'm very proud of @entity13 along with many hundreds of thousands of people who speak the language			1

mrs @entity14 said : ' this is n't what i wanted at all			2
i speak @entity18 and want to conduct my life in @entity18			0
@entity8 offer a @entity18 service and i wanted to make use of it			1
' it was so odd			0
i had rung through and asked for a @entity18 speaker but without success			2
i was called back and i asked if the caller was from the @entity18			2
' he then said : " what 's @entity18 ? " and i replied : " it 's the language spoken in @entity13			1
" ' he then said : " where 's @entity13 ? " so i told him it was a proud country in the @entity85 with its own history and culture			2
mrs @entity14 said she is passionate about promoting and preserving the @entity88 , and added ' i speak @entity18 and want to conduct my life in @entity18 ' ' he then told me he could n't put the call through because he did n't know what @entity13 was			1

' the @entity88 service is important in many aspects			0
it provides an important service for the welsh people but if no one uses it , perhaps because they do n't know its there , or if advisors elsewhere do n't know of it , then it would not be unreasonable for @entity8 to conclude it is n't needed and close it down			0
