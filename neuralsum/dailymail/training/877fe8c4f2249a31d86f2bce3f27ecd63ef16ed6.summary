@entity2 , the master thief is back with this announcement trailer for @entity7 - @entity6 's next title : @entity8			1
and unluckily for current - gen owners , it is in development for the new wave of consoles and pc			1
there is still no word on whether it will feature on @entity17 and @entity18			1
now you see him , now you do n't : the thief games have had a huge impact on the ' sneak - em - up ' genre , inspiring games such as @entity27 and the more recent @entity28 there is a rising tide of fear in @entity32			1
hatred saturates every stone and whilst the rich prosper , the less fortunate face misery and repression			0
ravaged with sickness and famine , they wait for something to change			0
similar to last year 's hit , @entity28 , @entity8 is a first - person adventure featuring intelligent design that allows players to take full control			1
expect levels to be ' slightly sandbox ' , giving you the freedom to forge your own path through the game			2
@entity2 is rumoured to have a ' @entity55 ' mode , which enhances his vision and highlights objects of interest			0
it can also slow down time , making pickpocketing easier			0
expect weapons such as the blackjack , compound bow and claw ( for grappling ) to feature heavily in the gameplay , too			2
watch the reveal trailer here : follow us on @entity69 : @ @entity70 and on @entity71 : @entity72 .			0

*confirmed* for next - generation consoles and pc
first - person adventure gives you freedom to *tackle* *missions* how you want
