praise : prime minister @entity20 visits the flagship @entity6 in @entity7 last year the revelation , broadcast in a @entity23 investigation last night , is a major embarrassment for the government and follows a series of controversies about free schools			1
last week , the @entity30 free school in @entity31 was threatened with closure after @entity33 criticised it as ‘ dysfunctional ’			2
free schools can be set up by charities , parents and teachers and are independent of local authority control			2
@entity6 was one of the first free schools to open in september 2011 and was praised by @entity20 on a visit last year			1
an inquiry was launched following allegations raised by a whistleblower about the way the school was being governed			0
concerns raised by accountants hired by the school led to a ‘ forensic ’ investigation by the @entity50			0
last week , the @entity30 free school in @entity31 was threatened with closure after @entity33 criticised it as ' dysfunctional ' its final report published yesterday , found that of a £ 182,933 grant made to the school before it opened , £ 86,335 had not been used for its intended purposes			1
invoices worth £ 59,560 were not supported by any evidence of payments being made			1
this included ‘ fabricated ’ invoices to the sum of £ 10,800 to cover rent for office accommodation			1
a total of £ 26,775 had been overpaid against legitimate payments			2
the report revealed how more than £ 600 was spent on parties or meals , £ 169 went to a teacher to buy new clothes , payments were made to cover staff rent and furniture purchases and the former vice chairman of governors was allowed to travel first class			1
@entity78 , of the @entity79 , described the financial irregularities as a ' disgrace ' the former chairman of governors was paid £ 2,400 for holding three meetings in a way that appeared to be ‘ contrary to the funding agreement ’ of the school			2
the @entity15 yesterday insisted a plan has been put in place to recover funds and the school has been asked to address concerns urgently			0
the school was issued with a warning notice in may and has since implemented a plan to restructure its governing body and appoint an experienced finance director			0
@entity78 , of the @entity79 , said : ‘ it is now apparent that the @entity15 has been sitting on the report detailing financial irregularities at the @entity6 since may and only released it once it became clear that the @entity79 had released to the press its own document outlining financial irregularities at the school			2
‘ the catalogue of irregularities and what frankly points to fraud in the management of the school ’s finances acknowledged in the @entity15 ’s investigation report is a disgrace			0
‘ problems around good governance , financial probity and standards of education are emerging in increasing numbers of free schools			0
the government can not continue to claim that these are isolated cases			0
’ a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ academies and free schools are subject to tougher financial accountability measures than maintained schools			0
‘ unfortunately no system of financial accountability for any school can guarantee it will prevent all wrongdoing			0
‘ however , we take swift action when concerns are raised – academies and free schools can not hide from their financial responsibilities and are held to account for their actions			0
