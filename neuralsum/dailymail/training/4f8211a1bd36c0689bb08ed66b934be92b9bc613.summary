@entity0 scored twice as @entity1 took @entity2 apart in this this fixture last season			1
for @entity1 and @entity7 , however , the goal he scored late at @entity6 on sunday may prove more important			1
@entity0 in some ways epitomises @entity1 ’s defending in that he does n’t always look quite good enough			1
there is no doubting the @entity12 ’s bravery , however			0
he may have been withdrawn had @entity1 had better back - up on their bench after a horrible clash with @entity17 that left him with a stud - shaped hole in the back of his head			1
all wrapped up like a rather sombre @entity24 present , though , @entity0 rampaged on and the crashing header he delivered from a corner at the death has at least given his manager reason to believe that maybe not everything in the football universe is against him right now			1
@entity0 jumps above the @entity2 back line to power home a late leveller with his head and claim a point @entity1 centre back @entity0 celebrates after scoring a dramatic equaliser against @entity2 in injury time as nine minutes of injury time – added on solely because of @entity0 ’s injury – rolled by , @entity1 did appear to be heading to a successive @entity40 defeat in eight days			1
once again , it would have been unjust			0
the figures of @entity1 ’s last two games , against @entity44 and @entity2 , are stacked remarkably in their favour			1
more shots , more passes , but somehow there have been fewer goals			0
this time , at least , @entity7 ’ team managed to emerge with a little of what they deserved			1
@entity1 are getting better , of that there is no doubt			1
the first half they contributed against @entity57 in the @entity58 just two weeks away was dismal			0
they played without tempo , conviction or rhythm			0
at that point – so bad were they as they exited the competition – that it was tempting to worry a little for @entity7 ’ future			1
since then , though , @entity1 ’s manager has summoned up a little anger , a little bit of dog , and his team have responded , at least in the manner of their performances			1
@entity76 is congratulated by his team - mates after opening the scoring during the clash at @entity6 @entity17 expertly puts the ball through the legs of @entity82 to give @entity2 the lead at @entity6 much is still awry			1
@entity1 defended horribly at times once again on sunday and @entity82 hinted once again at what we already know			1
he is not the answer to @entity1 ’s goalkeeping problems			2
meanwhile , they lack ruthlessness in front of goal which is hardly surprising given that they lack a reliable centre forward			0
their football , however , is beginning to resemble that of last season in some areas			0
on sunday , as they did at @entity98 a week ago , they worried @entity2 for long periods with some neat midfield combinations and some much improved running off the ball			1
if their attacking play had a focal point , someone like @entity105 for example , then they may begin to move forwards			0
their best players in the first half were the creative @entity110 @entity76 and 20 - year - old @entity111			1
the young @entity112 was the fall guy against @entity57 as he was sent off but has shown enough in recent days to suggest he may transpire to be a rare success for @entity1 ’s much - talked about transfer committee			1
@entity116 beats @entity1 defender @entity0 to equalise for the @entity117 shortly before half - time @entity7 's side had looked as though they were heading for their second consecutive defeat for the first 40 minutes , @entity1 were the only team in the game but struggled to open @entity2 up			1
perhaps @entity122 knew what he was doing			0
@entity1 are at their best rampaging forward on the counter attack but find things much harder when confronted with teams sitting deep			2
this is how it was on sunday as @entity1 poked and prodded without ever really looking desperately dangerous			2
it was the closing minutes of the half , though , that summed up @entity7 ’ problems at the moment			2
finally they scored only to concede horribly – scruffily – at the other end			0
one step forwards two steps back			0
after that it was not surprising to see the home team fall behind			0
this is how it has been this season			0
one setback often follows another at @entity6			2
@entity7 talks to @entity1 captain @entity143 during the @entity40 clash at @entity6 @entity145 was sent off for @entity1 after receiving two bookings in as many minutes @entity147 strikes late to earn @entity1 draw @entity122 suggested his team had played with ‘ the handbrake on ’ for too long and even floated the idea that his team were still troubled mentally by last february ’s 5 - 1 hiding			1
if that is the case then @entity122 needs to borrow @entity1 ’s psychologist dr @entity154 for a while			2
still @entity2 managed to lead , though			2
their second goal was easy on their eye from their point of view but @entity1 ’s video analysis today will show three red shirts marking dead space as @entity17 was left unattended			2
all of that is familiar to @entity7 , of course			2
@entity1 continue to defend without authority and as long as that continues they will struggle to close the rather large gap between themselves and the top four			0
their manager , though , will at least see other , better , things in his team that he recognises now			0
on friday in his pre-match press conference he lost his composure with the media for the first time in two and a half seasons			0
if it was a show of defiance then it was mirrored , at least in part , by his team on sunday			0
@entity7 said afterwards that his team had been ‘ outstanding ’			0
they were n't , but they were much better			0

@entity1 and @entity2 drew 2 - 2 in their @entity40 clash at @entity6
@entity0 scored a late equaliser , @entity76 scored the opener
@entity1 finished the game with 10 men after @entity145 was sent off
@entity7 ' side have clearly improved in recent weeks
