by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 16:06 est , 22 july 2013 a few months ago i needed emergency pain relief following surgery to repair my knee after i 'd snapped several ligaments			1
it was snowing and as i was staying with friends and was still on crutches , i had to ring the out - of - hours gp to get a prescription sent to the local chemist for my prescription painkiller			1
but the @entity8 refused to do this , and gruffly insisted i go in to see him			1
when i finally shuffled into his surgery , the gp winced with embarrassment and wrote out a prescription immediately			1
worry compounded : @entity18 , a compound painkiller , is highly addictive to women but i should n't have been angry that he refused to prescribe my painkiller - co-codamol - over the phone : as a 37 - year - old female , i am the type of patient commonly addicted to this drug			1
over the past ten years , the number of prescriptions dispensed for co-codamol has almost doubled - from 8.8 million in 2001 to 15 million in 2011 - and some experts are calling for more care when treating patients for long - term pain			1
@entity18 is a compound painkiller , containing two ingredients - paracetemol and the stronger , more powerful codeine , an opiate that belongs to the same family of drugs as morphine and heroin			1
while codeine is an effective pain reliever , like other opioids it creates a feeling of calm and well - being			1
and like the other , stronger opiod drugs , it can be addictive			1
' patients and doctors perceive co-codamol as being the safest of all opiods , but in reality it does n't mean that it is safe , ' says @entity57 - based @entity56			2
studies consistently show that more women than men are addicted to opioids			1
they are also the ones more likely to seek help for it - the @entity65 , a charity which deals with addiction to over-the - counter and prescription drugs , reports that 65 per cent of inquiries to their helpline are from women			1
@entity74 ' co-codamol addiction ' into an internet search and you 'll find websites littered with women discussing this problem			1
@entity81 , writing on the forum @entity79 , says : ' it has recently become apparent to me that i am well and truly hooked on co-codamol , which i take for back pain			2
hooked : signs of addiction include growing tolerance , withdrawal symptoms , and using the drug in larger amounts for longer periods than intended ' i do n't know how to even begin to come off them because every time i go over three hours without any my body aches , i feel sick , get moody and agitated			2
' can anyone offer me some advice ? i am scared to go to the doctor in case they stop them all together			2
' another @entity104 member , @entity103 , replies : ' i am in the same situation , i have been taking co-codamol for about five years , pretty much every day for migraines			2
' at first i would only take them when needed , then somehow i found myself taking them every four to five hours , even when i did n't really have a headache - it was the relaxed warm feeling that they give me i needed a constant supply of			2
' co-codamol is available over the counter in low - dose packs ( 8mg codeine / 500mg paracetamol ) with large warnings not to take the drug for more than three days			1
these warnings followed a 2009 @entity122 report which highlighted the problem of addiction to low - strength co-codamol sold over the counter , and called for more awareness , control and education			2
yet the problem is not over-the - counter co-codamol , but prescription versions			2
these are much stronger ( 30mg codeine / 500mg paracetamol ) and dispensed in much larger packs with no overt addiction warnings			1
there are also few guidelines on how long the drug should be prescribed - the @entity136 advises that ' during long - term opioid treatment , reviews should be conducted at least monthly in the first six months after stable dosing has been achieved			2
' frequency of review there - after can be clinically determined by the complexity of the case , but should be at least biannually			2
' dr @entity56 has become so concerned that he recently wrote in the @entity148 calling for ' urgent research , action and honesty ' so the true scale of the problem can be identified			0
' prescriptions of co-codamol have almost doubled in a decade and that does n't reflect an increase in pain , but a lack of supervision of prescriptions , ' he says , explaining that gps are given no specific guidelines on how often to review prescriptions given to patients on repeat			1
' at first i would only take them when needed , then somehow i found myself taking them every four to five hours , even when i did n't really have a headache - it was the relaxed warm feeling that they give me i needed a constant supply of			0
' ' a few years ago , our practice noticed a large number of painkillers on repeat were being over-ordered , patients were having three times the amount they needed because the system was n't picking up on the orders			1
so we took all painkillers off repeat so patients had to be reviewed by a doctor when they wanted more			0
' signs of addiction include growing tolerance ( needing more to have the same effect ) , withdrawal symptoms ( feeling ill if the drug is not used regularly ) , and using the drug in larger amounts or for longer periods than intended , says @entity196 , emeritus professor of mental health research at @entity198 and a leading authority on substance misuse			0
one mother , 36 - year - old @entity201 , from @entity202 , found herself addicted to co-codamol prescribed for endometriosis - an often painful condition where cells that usually line the womb are found elsewhere in the body			0
' i 've been using opiates for more than ten years			0
@entity211 is the only thing that reduces my pain , ' she says			0
' about five years ago i realised it was n't even touching my pain - i was taking more than i needed as the “ hit ” , that warm , fuzzy feeling of pain relief , became less and less effective			0
' @entity201 had cravings and would search the house for pills , asking friends and relatives for their drugs left over from dental work or other prescriptions			1
the problem : it 's not over-the - counter co-codamol that is the issue , but the prescription versions ' i really felt like an addict , so i went cold turkey and it was like a scene from trainspotting - i was sweaty , awake for days , shivering , fluey			0
i was really worried about taking it again , but it 's the only thing that will help			0
' now , @entity201 limits herself to a minimal dose of co-codamol once a month - taking the low - strength over-the - counter tablets - to break the cycle of dependency			0
as professor @entity196 explains , patients need to monitor themselves , as @entity201 does , to avoid the risk of becoming dependent			0
' it 's not an all - or - nothing situation , where some people are n't dependent and others are total addicts , it 's a gradual process , ' he says			1
if you 're taking the pills for more than two or three weeks , he suggests trying to cut back			0
and if you ca n't , see your gp or local substance misuse service , or try to cut down yourself over a slow and controlled period of time - he advises against going ' cold turkey ' when you completely stop the drug abruptly			0
addiction to co-codamol is not something to be embarrassed about , adds dr @entity56			0
' doctors perhaps have n't made patients aware of the potential for addiction , ' he says			0
he also believes doctors need to acknowledge when there is a problem and help people come off @entity267 as someone who has experienced severe pain , knowing the risks of co-codamol has been a real problem			0
for having recently undergone reconstructive knee surgery , i was so concerned about over-using co-codamol as a result of my research that i did n't give myself adequate pain relief - and was consequently told off by my surgeon , who warned me that he needed me to limit my pain so i could walk around and shorten my healing time			0
happily , i 'm now well on my way to being back to normal .			0

@entity18 is a painkiller containing paracetamol and codeine
over the past decade , the number of prescriptions for it have doubled
