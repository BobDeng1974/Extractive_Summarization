homes have been evacuated and roads closed on the southern-most @entity2 following a government - issued warning about a possible volcanic eruption			2
the southern tip of @entity7 was shaken by a 4.3 - magnitude quake late on saturday as an underwater volcano just off the coast started spewing matter some 60ft into the air			1
the island , which has 500 volcanic cones , has experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the past four months			2
renewed fears of an eruption came as vast quantities of magma - the molten rock from just under the earth 's crust - began bubbling into the sea off the port of @entity24			1
this could force rock to emerge from the sea , creating a new island			1
in 2011 , the southern tip of @entity7 was shaken by a 4.3 - magnitude quake and magma appeared off the coast , pictured @entity35 said that explosive plumes and jets could be seen on the ocean surface from the underwater volcano which began erupting last month			1
some of the material is being ejected as high as 60ft into the air			2
the regional government of the @entity43 @entity2 issued a ' yellow ' volcanic eruption alert - the second on a four - level scale			0
@entity24 's 600 residents were evacuated last week after the volcanic activity began			0
now new evacuations have been called for people living along the southern end of the island			0
authorities have also shut down access to @entity24			0
evacuation : families leave @entity24 town for the second time in a month as activity from the underwater volcano off the coast increases			1
authorities are planning to evacuate other stretches of the coast in october 2011 , @entity7 was shaken by a 4.3 - magnitude quake as an underwater volcano started spewing matter 60ft into the air , pictured			1
the island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake ships have been ordered away from waters around the port and aircraft have been banned from flying over the island 's southern tip. the regional government of the @entity2 says scientists have detected airborne volcanic fragments called pyroclasts rising from the sea off @entity24			1
danger : the dark brown magma off @entity7 , with the town of @entity24 visible on the coast			1
@entity24 has been evacuated and shipping banned from the area			2
right , a closer image of the magma in the water this computer - generated image shows the underground volcano off the southern-most @entity2 , @entity7 the government said it awaited scientific reports on the danger posed by pyroclasts , but a research vessel that was collecting samples there has been ordered to stop			1
fears of an eruption have been going since the end of july , when @entity7 experienced the first of what has become more than 10,000 tremors - collectively known as an earthquake ' swarm '			1
residents were evacuated from some areas at the end of september when volcanic activity increased to more than 150 tremors in 24 hours			0
the army was put on standby for a mass evacuation			0
map showing the location of the volcano off the coast of @entity7 in the @entity2 volcano expert @entity119 said at the time : ' there is a ball of magma rising to the surface producing a series of ruptures which generate seismic activity			1
' we do n't know if that ball of magma will break through the crust and cause an eruption			2
' but he warned an eruption was possible ' in days , weeks or months '			0
the last eruption on @entity7 was in 1793 and lasted for a month			1
the last eruption in the @entity2 as a whole took place on the island of @entity139 in 1971			0

the last volcanic eruption in the @entity2 took place on the island of @entity139 in 1971 eruption : a diagram showing where the epicentres of tremors have been			0
@entity7 was formed when three volcanoes erupted 100 million years ago under the @entity2 lies an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the @entity153 - on which the islands sit - shifts			1
it is to this that the islands owe their very existence			0
most of the islands are still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller , previously undetected fault line also runs through the chain			0
@entity7 - which means ' iron ' in @entity43 - was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high			1
volcanic activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused @entity7 to expand continually			1
the last time it erupted was in 1793			0
some 50,000 years ago , massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a large part of the island to crack off and fall into the @entity176 , according to @entity177			0
that created the @entity180 valley on the island and caused an 300ft - high tsunami that probably reached the @entity184 coast			2
this feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on @entity139 - the most tectonically active of the @entity2 - could trigger a mega-tsunami			0
the theory - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line through the island would cause a major landslide under certain circumstances			0
that landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage all down the @entity176 of the @entity184 , the @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and the east coast of @entity201 .			2
