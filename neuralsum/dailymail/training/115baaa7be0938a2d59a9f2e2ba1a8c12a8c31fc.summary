paint pots and piles of paper scraps carpet the floor			0
the walls , a makeshift palette , are daubed with gashes of colour – shocking red , pale pink , livid blue			0

portrait of @entity3 talking by @entity34 ( pictured ) is due to be auctioned at @entity36 in @entity6 and is expected to fetch a world - record £ 40million @entity3 chose the latter option			1
and so began a near decade - long love affair between the small - time burglar and arguably the greatest @entity42 painter of modern times			1
this week , one of @entity34 ’s many tributes to @entity3 , portrait of @entity47 , is expected to become the most expensive single portrait ever auctioned when it goes on sale at @entity36 in @entity6 on thursday			1
it is thought the 6ft - tall 1966 oil painting – believed to be being sold by @entity54 financier @entity53 – will fetch up to £ 40million			1
it follows the sale of @entity34 ’s triptych of portraits of fellow artist @entity59 , which also set a new world record for an art auction when it fetched £ 89million last november			1
even by the standards of the art world , the latest portrait will set a new reference point – the @entity67 recently paid £ 40million for their seven - bedroom mansion in @entity6 ’s exclusive @entity69			1
portrait of @entity47 is one of the most famous images of @entity34 ’s lover , a man the artist immortalised on canvas but destroyed in real life			1
despite his upbringing on the fringes of the criminal underworld – he was a minor associate of the @entity81 – @entity3 was a fragile young man who was fundamentally ill - equipped to cope with the painter ’s cruel brilliance			1
he committed suicide in @entity85 in 1971 on the eve of @entity34 ’s retrospective at the @entity88 – an honour that had only ever been awarded to one other artist , @entity90			1
the show included the portrait , which last appeared on the open market in 2000 , when it sold for $ 6.6million ( £ 4million ) at @entity36 in @entity94			1
it was then believed to have been acquired by @entity96 in a private sale for $ 12million ( £ 7.3million ) more than five years ago			0
last night , a member of @entity3 ’s family spoke for the first time about the artist who some hold responsible for his lover ’s death			1
the relative , a woman in her 80s , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ @entity3 ’s family thought @entity34 was a degenerate man and wanted nothing to do with him			1
affair : @entity3 ( left ) met @entity34 ( right ) in 1963 while breaking into the artist 's house and they began an affair			1
@entity3 was painted several times by @entity34 and became his greatest muse ' he was not liked by the family because we thought he was an awful man			1
‘ i suppose we had nothing in common with someone like @entity34			2
but the dislike of him was because of the sort of person he was			0
that feeling has never changed			0
even now , i do n’t want to talk about him			0
’ @entity34 , who died in 1992 aged 82 , was an alluring but dangerous figure			1
@entity128 , author of @entity34 , @entity129 , who was a friend of @entity130 , said : ‘ @entity34 was mesmerising , an electrifying presence			2
' he was hugely seductive , intuitive , enormously clever			0
he had this desire to devour people			0
‘ it was an animal thing			0
@entity3 could n’t read and write			2
someone quipped he learnt how to write when @entity34 gave him a cheque book			2
' @entity3 was rather kind , docile even , and that was the problem			2
@entity34 wanted a tough lover who could make him suffer because he was masochistic			2
' @entity3 was more than 20 years younger and he was too gentle , too nice , even though he came from that background			2
’ nevertheless , @entity3 became @entity34 ’s greatest muse			1
he painted him more than any other person			0
through @entity34 , @entity3 became someone but the psychological impact on him was devastating			1
@entity144 ( left ) and @entity145 ( right ) are two other @entity147 sketches of his lover who committed suicide aged just 36 before a gallery opening of @entity34 's work @entity128 said : ‘ someone once said to me , “ i ca n’t think of a worse fate than to be loved by @entity34			1
” because he left you no air to breathe			0
' @entity34 gave @entity3 an existence but he was absorbed by him			1
@entity34 was n’t a monster			2
he was caring but he pushed himself to the limits and so he ’d do that to other people , too			0
’ @entity3 took refuge in drink and he and his relationship with @entity34 began to disintegrate			1
by the time of the @entity85 retrospective , they were no longer together			0
the artist had grown tired of his lover but as he was the inspiration for so many paintings in the exhibition , he felt it was only right he should be there – as long as he remained sober			2
instead , @entity3 began drinking the moment they arrived			2
the day before the exhibition , he was found slumped on the lavatory , with an empty bottle of barbiturates on the floor			0
@entity128 said : ‘ he kept coming back to @entity85 , even booking into the same hotel			0
it was as though he needed to be near the scene of the death , to plumb the depths of his feelings and sensations			0
' he told me , “ there ’s not an hour goes by that i do n’t think about @entity3 and feel profoundly guilty			2
” ’ @entity34 poured his grief into his work , obsessively painting @entity3 for years after his death			1
he had other relationships but no one ever affected him in the way @entity3 had .			0
