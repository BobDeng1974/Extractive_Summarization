by @entity0 published : 00:10 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 8 august 2013 scientists are to create mutant forms of the @entity4 bird flu virus that has emerged in @entity5 so they can work out the risk of a lethal human pandemic			1
highly transmissible and deadly forms of @entity4 will be made in several high security laboratories around the world - but it is vital to prepare for the threat , the scientists say			1
the new bird flu virus , which was unknown in humans until february , has already infected at least 133 people in @entity5 and @entity16 , killing 43 of them , according to the latest @entity18 ( @entity18 ) data			1
members of staff at a chicken slaughter house in the suburb of @entity23 , @entity5 announcing plans to start the controversial experiments , leading virologists @entity24 and @entity26 said @entity4 's pandemic risk would rise ' exponentially ' if it gained the ability to spread easily among people			1
the only way to find out how likely that is , and how many genetic changes would need to take place before it could happen , is to engineer those mutations in laboratory conditions and test the virus 's potential using animal models , they said			2
' it 's clear this @entity4 virus has some hallmarks of pandemic viruses , and it 's also clear it is still missing at least one or two of the hallmarks we 've seen in the pandemic viruses of the last century , ' @entity24 told @entity49			1
the new bird flu virus has already infected at least 133 people in @entity5 ' so the most logical step forward is to put in those ( missing ) mutations first			1
' writing in the journals @entity54 and @entity55 on behalf of 22 scientists who will carry out various aspects of the @entity4 work , @entity24 said because the risk of a pandemic caused by a bird flu virus exists in nature , it was critical for risk - mitigation plans to study the likely mutations that could make that happen			1
this kind of science is known as ' gain of function ' ( @entity72 ) research			0
it aims to identify combinations of genetic mutations that allow an animal virus to jump to humans and spread easily			2
by finding the mutations needed , researchers and health authorities can better assess how likely it is that a new virus could become dangerous and if so , how soon they should begin developing drugs , vaccines and other scientific defenses			2
yet such work is highly controversial			0
it has fuelled an international row in the past two years after it was carried out on another threatening bird flu virus called @entity90			2
infectious particles of the avian @entity4 virus emerging from a cell			1
scientists who sparked an outcry by creating easier - to - spread versions of the bird flu want to try such experiments again when @entity24 and @entity26 announced in late 2011 they had found how to make @entity90 into a form that could spread between mammals , the @entity100 @entity99 ( @entity99 ) was so alarmed that it took the unprecedented step of trying to censor publication of the studies			2
the @entity99 said it feared details of the work could fall into the wrong hands and be used for bioterrorism			0
a year - long delay on such research followed while the @entity18 , @entity100 security advisers and international flu researchers sought ways to ensure the highest safety controls			1
the laboratory @entity24 will be working in is known as a @entity120 lab ( @entity119 ) , the highest level of biosecurity that can be achieved in academic research			0
' nature is the biggest threat to us , not what we do in the lab. what we do in the lab is under very intense biosecurity measures , ' he said			0
the experiments aim to identify combinations of genetic mutations that allow an animal virus to jump to humans and spread ' there are layers upon layers of layers of biosafety measures such that if one layer might break there are additional layers to prevent this virus ever coming out			0
' @entity24 said research has been ' under fire ' recently			0
' one of the accusations against the flu community was that we were not transparent enough about what experiments were being done , and why and how they were being done , ' he said			0
' we 're trying to pre-empt such accusations this time			0
' the @entity4 bird flu outbreak currently appears under control with only three new human cases in may , after 87 in april and 30 in march			1
experts say this is largely thanks to the closure of many live poultry markets and because of warmer @entity163 as winter approaches in @entity5 , many experts believe @entity4 could re-emerge , meaning the threat of a pandemic looms if it mutates to become easily transmissible between people			1
@entity168 , an @entity170 flu expert , said it would be ludicrous to shy away from such studies			0
' this type of work is like fitting glasses for someone who ca n't see well , ' she said			0
' without the glasses the vision is blurred and uncertain , with them you can focus on the world and deal with it a lot more easily			0

deadly forms of @entity4 will be made in high security labs around the world
new bird virus has already infected at least 133 people in @entity5 and @entity16
forty - three people have died according to @entity18
scientists said it is vital to prepare for a lethal human pandemic
