solar flares on the @entity1 can knock out power and affect communications on @entity4			2
however , @entity5 has spotted something far more dangerous - the strongest , hottest , and longest - lasting sequence of stellar flares ever seen from a nearby red dwarf star			2
the initial blast from this record - setting series of explosions was as much as 10,000 times more powerful than the largest solar flare ever recorded			1
both stars are dim red dwarfs with masses and sizes about one - third of our sun 's			1
they orbit each other at about three times @entity4 's average distance from the sun , which is too close for @entity29 to determine which star erupted			1
at its peak , the flare reached temperatures of 360 million degrees @entity34 ( 200 million @entity35 ) , more than 12 times hotter than the center of the sun. stars erupt with flares for the same reason the sun does			1
around active regions of the star 's atmosphere , magnetic fields become twisted and distorted			0
much like winding up a rubber band , these allow the fields to accumulate energy			0
eventually a process called magnetic reconnection destabilizes the fields , resulting in the explosive release of the stored energy we see as a flare			2
the outburst emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves to visible , ultraviolet and x-ray light			2
' we used to think major flaring episodes from red dwarfs lasted no more than a day , but @entity29 detected at least seven powerful eruptions over a period of about two weeks , ' said @entity68 , an astrophysicist at @entity5 's @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , who gave a presentation on the ' superflare ' at the august meeting of the @entity75 's @entity74			0
' this was a very complex event			0
' at its peak , the flare reached temperatures of 360 million degrees @entity34 ( 200 million @entity35 ) , more than 12 times hotter than the center of the sun. the ' superflare ' came from one of the stars in a close binary system known as @entity19 , or @entity20 for short , located about 60 light - years away			1
both stars are dim red dwarfs with masses and sizes about one - third of our sun 's			1
they orbit each other at about three times @entity4 's average distance from the sun , which is too close for @entity29 to determine which star erupted			1
' this system is poorly studied because it was n't on our watch list of stars capable of producing large flares , ' said @entity100 , an astronomer at the @entity101 in @entity102 and a deputy project scientist for @entity5 's @entity104 , now under construction			2
' we had no idea @entity20 had this in it			0
' most of the stars lying within about 100 light - years of the solar system are , like the sun , middle - aged			1
but a thousand or so young red dwarfs born elsewhere drift through this region , and these stars give astronomers their best opportunity for detailed study of the high - energy activity that typically accompanies stellar youth			2
astronomers estimate @entity20 was born about 30 million years ago , which makes it less than 0.7 percent the age of the solar system			1

the outburst emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves to visible , ultraviolet and x-ray light			0
at 5:07 p.m. edt on april 23 , the rising tide of x-rays from @entity20 's superflare triggered @entity29 's @entity153 ( @entity29 )			0
within several seconds of detecting a strong burst of radiation , the @entity29 calculates an initial position , decides whether the activity merits investigation by other instruments and , if so , sends the position to the spacecraft			0
in this case , @entity29 turned to observe the source in greater detail , and , at the same time , notified astronomers around the globe that a powerful outburst was in progress			0
' for about three minutes after the @entity29 trigger , the superflare 's x-ray brightness was greater than the combined luminosity of both stars at all wavelengths under normal conditions , ' noted @entity176 's @entity175 , who is leading a detailed study on the event			0
' flares this large from red dwarfs are exceedingly rare			0
' the star 's brightness in visible and ultraviolet light , measured both by ground - based observatories and @entity29 's @entity185 , rose by 10 and 100 times , respectively			1
the initial flare 's x-ray output , as measured by @entity29 's @entity189 , puts even the most intense solar activity recorded to shame			1
the largest solar explosions are classified as extraordinary , or x class , solar flares based on their x-ray emission			1
this 01 october , 2001 @entity197 ( @entity196 ) @entity195 ( @entity195 ) image of the @entity1 shows a solar flare leaping out from an active sunspot ( lower - r )			1
the largest solar explosions are classified as extraordinary , or x class , solar flares based on their x-ray emission			1
' the biggest flare we 've ever seen from the sun occurred in november 2003 and is rated as @entity205 , ' explained @entity68			2
' the flare on @entity20 , if viewed from a planet the same distance as @entity4 is from the sun , would have been roughly 10,000 times greater than this , with a rating of about @entity211			1
' three hours after the initial outburst , with x-rays on the downswing , the system exploded with another flare nearly as intense as the first			1
over the next 11 days , @entity29 detected a series of successively weaker blasts			0
@entity100 compares the dwindling series of flares to the cascade of aftershocks following a major earthquake .			0

' @entity237 ' came from one of the stars in a close binary system known as @entity19 located about 60 light - years away .
