two @entity1 police officers were charged with murder monday in the shooting death of a knife - wielding homeless man that led to sometimes violent protests and a federal investigation into the city 's police force			1
the decision to bring murder charges occurred at a time when police tactics are under intense scrutiny nationwide , fueled by the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18 - year - old in @entity17 , @entity18 , and the chokehold death of another unarmed man in @entity21			1
grand juries declined to charge officers in those cases , leading to large protests			2
acknowledging the frustration over the secrecy of the proceedings in those cases , the @entity1 district attorney said she would bypass the grand jury process and instead present the murder case to a judge at a preliminary hearing that will be open to the public			2
caught on camera : @entity37 , 38 , left , is shown during a standoff with officers in the @entity41 foothills in @entity1 , @entity42 before police fatally shot him murderers ? @entity46 team member @entity45 ( right ) and former detective @entity47 ( left ) fatally shot @entity37 , a mentally ill homeless man who had frequent violent run - ins with law enforcement and they 've now been charged with murder ' unlike @entity17 and unlike in @entity21 , we 're going to know			1
the public is going to have that information , ' district attorney @entity52 said			0
police said @entity46 team member @entity45 and former detective @entity47 fatally shot @entity37 , a mentally ill homeless man who had frequent violent run - ins with law enforcement			1
video from an officer 's helmet camera showed @entity37 appearing to surrender when officers opened fire , but a defense lawyer characterized him as an unstable suspect who was ' unpredictably and dangerously close to a defenseless officer while he was wielding two knives			1
' ' i 'm looking forward ... to the @entity69 's office presenting one single witness that says this is murder , ' said @entity72 , a lawyer for @entity47			1
the district attorney refused to provide specifics about the reasons for bringing the case , but said it was a lengthy and deliberate process involving several members of her staff			0
according to @entity81 , police recordings revealed officer @entity47 -- while speaking of @entity37 ( pictured ) -- saying he was ' going to shoot him in penis with a shotgun ' just hours before the deadly shooting each officer faces a single count in the march death of the 38 - year - old @entity37			1
the charges allow prosecutors to pursue either first - degree or second - degree murder against the officers			2
even before @entity37 's death , the @entity92 was investigating the use of force by @entity1 police			1
the department recently signed an agreement to make changes after the government issued a harsh report			0
the agreement requires police to provide better training for officers and to dismantle troubled units			0
since 2010 , @entity1 police have been involved in 40 shootings â€” 27 of them deadly			2
after @entity37 's death , outrage over the trend grew and culminated with protests that included a demonstration where authorities fired tear gas and another that shut down a @entity115 meeting			1
the criminal charges were the first @entity52 has brought against officers in a shooting			2
she is in her fourth term as district attorney and is waging a fight with the @entity122 over allegations that she committed bribery while intervening on behalf of her son in a burglary case			0
police believe she should be charged with bribery because , they say , she offered to pay a victim not to press charges			0
the attorney general 's office is handling the matter			0
@entity52 said the charges against police had nothing to with the agency 's investigation into her and that her office got the case long before the bribery claims came to light			0
the next step in the case will be a preliminary hearing where a judge will decide whether the case can proceed			0
the officers have not been booked or arrested			0
that would not happen until a judge renders a decision at the preliminary hearing			0
a date has not been set			0
@entity52 has been criticized for her office 's decades - old practice of using grand juries to affirm prosecutors ' decisions that no probable cause existed to charge officers in shootings			1
dangerously close ? video from an officer 's helmet camera showed @entity37 appearing to surrender when officers opened fire , but a defense lawyer characterized him as an unstable suspect who was ' unpredictably and dangerously close to a defenseless officer while he was wielding two knives ' the office of @entity170 district attorney @entity52 is pursuing charges against the two @entity1 officers			1
@entity52 is waging a fight with the @entity122 over allegations that she committed bribery while intervening on behalf of her son in a burglary case under a revamped system , county prosecutors now decide whether there 's probable cause that a crime was committed and either take the case to a grand jury or opt to file a ' criminal information ' charge on their own			0
@entity187 said there is ' not one shred ' of evidence to support the case and insisted the officer had no criminal intent when he encountered @entity37			2
he said @entity47 followed training procedures outlined by the police department			2
@entity195 , an attorney for @entity45 , said he was ' confident that the facts will vindicate officer @entity45 's actions in this case			1
' the @entity198 is also investigating , but @entity200 authorities have not said if the officers will face federal charges			0
@entity203 , a police critic and an american studies professor at the @entity205 , said he was pleased that @entity52 finally brought charges against @entity1 officers after years of pressure			2
' this is the first time an independent agency is holding @entity1 police accountable , ' @entity203 said			0
police are legally empowered to use deadly force when appropriate , and a 1989 @entity214 decision concluded that an officer 's use of force must be evaluated through the ' perspective of a reasonable officer on scene rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight			1
' @entity223 , a professor at @entity224 in @entity225 who studies police misconduct , found that local officers were charged in 41 cases with murder or manslaughter stemming from on - duty shootings between 2005 and 2011			0
by comparison , over the same period , police agencies reported more than 2,700 cases of justifiable homicide by law enforcement officers to the @entity198 , and that statistic is incomplete			1
the figures suggest it 's difficult to get a conviction ' because juries are so reluctant to second - guess an officer 's split - second decision , ' @entity223 said			1
