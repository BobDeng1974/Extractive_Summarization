by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:20 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 06:10 est , 3 january 2013 a worker in the @entity5 medical examiner 's office is now under investigation after it was revealed that she took her husband to view the body of @entity11 school gunman @entity10 days after he murdered 27 people before taking his own life			1
the woman , a technician at the state medical examiner 's office , reportedly allowed her husband to see @entity10 's body two days after the horrific school massacre on december 14			1
the @entity19 identified the woman as @entity20			2
but before that , @entity20 allegedly went inside the room - with her husband in tow - unzipped the body bag and allowed him to get a good look			1
sources told the paper that @entity20 's husband does not work at the state , and her supervisor was aware that he had been there			2
neither @entity20 - who was placed on administrative leave - nor chief medical examiner @entity53 would comment when reached by the @entity19			2
coroner : chief medical examiner @entity55 suspended the worker after the allegations were brought to his attention @entity10 forced his way into the elementary school less than two weeks before @entity28 - killing 20 first - grade children in their classrooms and six adults			1
he then shot himself in the head			0
it was later found that @entity10 's first victim had been his own mother @entity67 , who was shot multiple times in her home as she laid in bed			1
earlier this week , it was revealed that @entity10 's body had been claimed for a private burial by his father , @entity75 , who had divorced his mother several years ago and was living with his new wife in @entity78 , @entity5			1
police have not offered a motive for the killings			0
@entity75 works in financial services with @entity83 and has finally claimed the body of his son @entity10 who committed the @entity11 on december 14th police tape stretches across the front yard of the @entity90 residence in @entity91 , @entity5			1
@entity10 reportedly shot his mother @entity67 inside before beginning his killing spree on december 14th @entity11 shooter @entity10 at an unknown location in 2005 - @entity10 's @entity96 is being examined for any evidence that could shed light on his actions that day scientists were asked to study @entity10 's dna to see if has an ' evil ' gene that led him to carry out the massacre			1
the study , which will look at any abnormalities or mutations in his individual dna , is believed to be the first of its kind ever carried out on a mass @entity109 massacre prompted president @entity110 to look into new gun controls and banning assault rifles such as @entity113 used by @entity10 in his rampage			1
the study of the killer 's dna was been ordered by @entity53 - who carried out the post-mortems on all the victims			1
he has contacted geneticists at @entity121 's to conduct the study			0
geneticists said they are likely looking at @entity10 's @entity96 to detect a mutation or abnormality that could increase the risk of aggressive or violent behavior			1
they could analyse @entity10 's entire genome in great detail and try to find any unexpected mutations			2
@entity67 is pictured on a cruise at @entity130 , @entity131 in this october 11 , 2008 photo - @entity90 was the mother of suspected gunman @entity10 @entity133 , a professor at @entity134 , said the @entity121 geneticists are most likely trying to ' detect clear abnormalities of what we would call a mutation in a gene '			2
he added : ' @entity142 gene abnormalities and there are some abnormalities that are related to aggressive behavior			0
' they might look for mutations that might be associated with mental illnesses and ones that might also increase the risk for violence			0
@entity133 , who is also the chairman of @entity134 's department of molecular and human genetics in @entity154 , @entity151 said geneticists should be doing this type of research because there are ' some mutations that are known to be associated with at least aggressive behavior if not violent behavior			0
' ' i do n't think any one of these mutations would explain all of ( the mass shooters ) , but some of them would have mutations that might be causing both schizophrenia and related schizophrenia violent behavior , ' @entity133 said			0
' i think we could learn more about it and we should learn more about it			0
' state police personnel lead children from the @entity11 in this handout picture from the @entity176 , in @entity91 , @entity5 @entity133 , who is chairman of the @entity134 department of molecular and human genetics , said studying the genes of murderers is controversial because there is a risk that those with similar genetic characteristics could possibly be discriminated against or stigmatized			2
but he said the research into @entity90 would be helpful even if only a " fraction " may have the abnormality or mutation			0
' not all of these people will have identifiable genetic abnormalities , ' @entity133 told @entity192 in @entity27			0
' by studying genetic abnormalities we can learn more about conditions better and who is at risk and what might be dramatic treatments , ' @entity133 said , adding if the gene abnormality is defined the ' treatment to stop ' other mass shootings or ' decrease the risk is much approved			0
' although known to be shy and social inept @entity90 had not shown any violent streak although he was known to spend hours in the basement of his home playing violent video games .			0

@entity20 now under investigation after she allegedly took her husband to the area where @entity10 was being kept after the massacre
@entity75 wished to remain *anonymous* when he arrived to take his son 's body several days ago
study of @entity10 's dna will be the first one of its kind and will *evaluate* any genetic evidence for the mass killing
20 first graders and six *members* of staff at @entity11 were killed in december 14 shooting , *including* his mother
