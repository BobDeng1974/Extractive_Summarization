a computer programme has been used to predict how people are feeling when they type			1
in a study participants were asked to type a particular phrase and the programme then estimated if they were happy , sad and so on			2
remarkably it was correct 70 per cent of the time , and the findings could lead to smarter artificial intelligence in the future			1
@entity11 in @entity12 researchers studied typing			1
they found that the way a person types can reveal how they are feeling ( stock image shown )			1
in the study 25 people were asked to write a section of a book			1
a computer programme then predicted with 70 per cent accuracy how they were feeling the study published in the journal @entity27 and @entity28 was carried out by researchers at the @entity11 in @entity12 , reports @entity29			1
in the research 25 people ranging from 15 to 40 years old were asked to retype two paragraphs from @entity33 by @entity34			2
they also had to enter their emotional state every 30 minutes while doing their regular activities on the computer			0
researchers have revealed exactly what mobile phone users type most - and say that ' i love you ' is the most popular three word sentence			0
the team at @entity45 analysed web data along with anonymous data from their hugely popular alternative keyboard , which has been downloaded to more than 100 million devices , and also found phone users are extremely polite			0
the single most commonly used one word sentence in @entity52 is ' thanks ' and the most popular two word phrase is ' thank you '			0
this allowed the programme an opportunity to understand how their emotions changed their typing style			2
moods tested were joy , fear , anger , sadness , disgust , shame and guilt			0
the result was that the programme could identify a person 's mood correctly 70 per cent of the time			2
it was most successful in identifying joyfulness with an 87 per cent success rating , while sadness was the least accurate at 60 per cent			2
the researchers noted that the participants were less likely to input data when they were in a bad mood , which may explain the inaccuracy of the latter result			0
@entity84 was predicted successfully most often and least successful was sadness			1
the researchers say this could lead to smarter artificial intelligence in future that can make suggestions to us based on how we are typing at that moment in time ( stock image shown ) however the findings could have important implications for artificial intelligence , and it may allow computers to engage with us in a more friendly manner			1
' if we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions - that is , it can detect user emotions and change its behavior accordingly - then using machines could be more effective and friendly , ' the researchers wrote			0
for example , this could enable pop - up ads to be tailored to how you are feeling at the moment			0
or , when looking for a movie on @entity114 , perhaps an algorithm could make suggestions for films that would match your mood .			0
