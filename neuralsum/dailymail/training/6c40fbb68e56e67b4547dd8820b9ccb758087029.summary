@entity1 's @entity0 is noted in high society for its host 's exquisite taste that captivates his guests			1
but it was n't a dazzling gown , a spellbinding symphony , or even a tasty hors d'oeuvre that captivated attendees of the extravaganza last night ... but a full - blown punch up between two tie - and - tailed classical music enthusiasts			0
the brawl 's most talked about moment came when one of the pugilists managed to swing a punishing hook with his right hand without spilling a drop of champagne from the glass in his left			2
his older opponent countered with a right but was unable to prevent the blow from landing squarely on his jaw , leaving a nasty gash on his chin			0
the altercation rather took the gloss off what was meant to be @entity35 's night , who was allegedly paid $ 500,000 by an 83 - year - old billionaire to be his date for the evening			1
fortunately , though , the reality tv star was out of the room when the rough and tumble commenced , but she stormed out of the party anyway after an usher reportedly insulted her fiance , @entity44			2
the civilised hum of high - society hobnobbing was shattered when the two men - one in his mid- 60s and another in his 40s - began shouting at each other and waving their fists			1
in an instant the row turned ugly as the younger man swung for his enemy , catching him stoutly on the chin with his ring			0
when the fight ended , the older assailant was eager to show off the cut on his face from which blood had poured over his pristine - white dress shirt and tie			1
@entity35 it for the money : the altercation rather took the gloss off what was meant to be @entity35 's night , who @entity1 millionaire @entity105 ( right ) allegedly paid $ 500,000 to attend the extravaganza causing a stir : fortunately , though , the reality tv star , 33 , was out of the room when punches started flying , but she stormed out of the party anyway after an usher reportedly insulted her fiance , @entity44 it is yet unclear who the men were , but by the end of the night they were the talk of the party			1
almost every social group and profession in @entity78 , from confectioners to firefighters and pharmacists to refugees , holds its own ball , but the @entity128 is the most elite , with a presidential opening and top - class music and ballet			2
' it 's an event where the opera can present itself			0
it 's an important platform , ' opera director @entity134 told @entity136			0
but each year , the fine classical performances of the @entity138 and @entity139 are overshadowed in the @entity78 media by the paid celebrity guests invited by @entity1 billionaire mall developer and regular guest @entity105			2
a class jaw : the fight broke out at the @entity78 capital 's @entity76 as the event 's well - heeled guests mingled in the reception area over canapes and champagne nasty cut : when the fight ended , the older assailant was eager to show off the cut on his face from which blood had poured over his pristine - white dress shirt and tie talk of the party : it is yet unclear who the men were , but by the end of the night they were the talk of the party @entity105 's past guests have included singer @entity167 and actors @entity168 and @entity170			1
this year , reality - tv star @entity35 is his main guest			0
fortunately , miss @entity171 was nowhere near the fight when it broke out , choosing instead to watch the dancing from a vip box			0
the 33 - year - old did , however , cause a stir of her own when she allegedly refused to dance with her sponsor - despite her reported $ 500,000 attendance fee			0
high society : almost every social group and profession in @entity78 , from confectioners to firefighters and pharmacists to refugees , holds its own ball , but the @entity128 is the most elite , with a presidential opening and top - class music and ballet a fine treat : each year guests are treated to fine classical performances of the @entity138 and @entity139 according to @entity195 , the 81 - year - old told reporters during a photo call at his @entity198 that the reality star was not doing what he wanted			1
' @entity35 is annoying me because she 's not sticking to the program , ' he said			0
she later ditched her date and left the party early after she was approached by a white male who was working at the event with a ' black face ' and began to mimic her fiance @entity44 .			1

the fight was between a man in his 60s and one in his 40s as guests mingled in @entity1 's @entity76
it *erupted* as guests hobnobbed over champagne and canapes in a reception area at the *grandiose* music hall
the most talked about moment was when one of men managed to throw right hook without spilling drink in left hand
later the older pugilist showed off a nasty cut to his chin which had shed blood all over his once pristine dress shirt
@entity1 's @entity128 is @entity78 's *premier* high - society event in the social *calendar* and *attracts* @entity78 's great and good
@entity35 was also at the event after @entity78 billionaire @entity105 paid her an alleged $ 500,000 to attend
but she stormed out of the party after white usher ' with a blackened face ' *mocked* her fiance @entity44
@entity105 also *slammed* miss @entity171 for refusing to dance with him and *branded* her ' annoying '
