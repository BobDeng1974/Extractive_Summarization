@entity0 has been offered a route back into management by struggling @entity4 side @entity3			1
manager @entity5 was dismissed on sunday after their latest insipid display , a 1 - 0 loss at home to @entity10 that leaves them 19th in @entity12			1
the club have since approached @entity0 , who was sacked by @entity14 in april , in a bid to revive their fortunes			1
@entity18 's @entity17 talks you through the main talking points of @entity0 potential arrival at the @entity22 former @entity14 manager @entity0 has been offered the top job at @entity3 so what ’s the best thing about @entity3 if you ’re @entity0 ? @entity0 had a tough spell at @entity14 and was sacked after less than a season in charge you ’re not following @entity30 ; you ’re following @entity31 , a hugely inexperienced coach who probably should never have got the job			1
how much of a surprise would @entity0 taking over be ? @entity35 showed an interest when he was at @entity37 so he is known and respected in the @entity39 country			2
sociedad also have a track record of @entity43 managers with @entity44 and @entity45 both former coaches			1
it might be surprising if they end up being able to afford @entity0 ( right ) though			2
they picked @entity5 because he was the cheapest option			0
@entity51 ( @entity53 ) @entity52 , 1930 - 1935 @entity52 was a centre half from @entity55 in @entity56 who played for @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 in the first two decades of the 20th century			0
he moved to @entity4 in 1930 and managed @entity3 for five season before leading @entity63			1
@entity45 , 1985 - 1989/1991 - 1994/2001 - 2002 @entity64 legend @entity45 managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades			1
he led @entity3 to the @entity67 in 1987 , beating @entity68 on penalties in the final			2
he returned to @entity71 after his season at @entity73 and then again during the 2001 - 2002 season			0
@entity45 ( pictured holding a @entity3 shirt in 2001 ) has also managed the @entity12 outfit @entity44 , 2007 - 2008 after @entity45 had recommended the job to him , @entity44 joined @entity3 , then a second division club , in june 2007			1
he enjoyed success but fell out with newly - elected president @entity80 and resigned in january 2008 with the club fifth in the table			0
@entity83 boss @entity44 is the last @entity43 manager to have been in charge of @entity3 were n’t they in the @entity86 just last season ? they had the basis of a very good team but as soon as they reached the @entity86 they started selling their best players			1
@entity94 joined @entity73 and this summer @entity68 pinched @entity95 while @entity96 moved to @entity97			0
so what are the expectations ? @entity100 is the realistic aim			0
@entity68 are so strong there is only really one @entity86 spot left and @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity35 are well ahead in the race for that			0
it feels like a great fall from @entity14 ? @entity71 is a fantastic city			2
@entity0 will be given time and the playing squad is talented			2
@entity112 scores goals , midfielder @entity113 is a huge talent , and defender @entity115 was close to the @entity4 squad , and to a move to @entity97 , not so long ago			0
the raw materials are there to build a decent team — and he would be given more than one season to do the job this time			0
former @entity123 striker @entity112 has a formidable goalscoring record in @entity12 for sociedad			0

@entity0 has been out of work since being sacked by @entity14
@entity0 has been offered a job with @entity12 strugglers @entity3
the @entity131 is currently in @entity132 working for @entity133
@entity45 and @entity44 are *examples* of @entity43 managers who have managed at the @entity22 in the past
