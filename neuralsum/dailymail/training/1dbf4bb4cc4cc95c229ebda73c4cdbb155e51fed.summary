as well as draping himself in gold jewellery and wearing a camel - hair coat , mr @entity9 regularly told his family ‘ we ’re going to be millionaires ’ and had the swagger of an ‘ i ’m - a - @entity21 ’			1
inspiration : @entity9 , left , gave @entity11 the pattern for his inspiration in playing @entity14 , right , and he picked up on many of @entity28 's mannerisms , and imitated his dress sense sir @entity11 first met mr @entity9 when he was working as an electrician on a building site almost 20 years before the hit show was created by writer @entity33			1

’ while renovating properties during the day and selling on old furniture at night , mr @entity9 would insist on being impeccably presented at all times			1
and it seems the @entity92 ’ yellow three - wheeled @entity93 could have been inspired by the bright yellow @entity94 mr @entity9 surprised his wife @entity95 with			1
while the scriptwriters thought @entity14 – who lived in @entity96 , @entity60 – should be scruffy and have a fat belly , sir @entity11 resisted			1
