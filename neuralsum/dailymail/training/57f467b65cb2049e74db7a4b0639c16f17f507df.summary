by @entity1 reporter published : 17:42 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 21 january 2013 @entity2 branded her husband @entity8 an ‘ idiot ’ when he splashed out £ 12,000 at auction on a racehorse he knew absolutely nothing about			1
but the @entity10 ’s granddaughter has been forced to eat her words after @entity12 emerged victorious at the @entity13 – and his value raced to the £ 200,000 mark			1
the former @entity17 rugby star explained : ‘ i like to bid at auctions without meaning to actually win things			1
i only went for a bite to eat and a night out			0
no horse had gone for less than £ 28,000 so i thought my first bid of £ 10,000 was pretty safe , likewise when i upped it to £ 12,000			1
proud : owners @entity8 and @entity25 with their racehorse @entity27 , now worth £ 200k after an initial £ 12k pricetag ‘ i knew nothing about the horse , had n’t checked the brochure and could n’t even see the dude , as i was sitting with my back to the sale ring			1
’ fortunately for @entity8 , @entity37 – son of champion jockey @entity38 – and fellow rugby players @entity35 and @entity36 agreed to share the burden of the cost			1
@entity37 had to make a 30 - minute drive from the sale room to his home in @entity45 so he could pick up a lorry to transport the impromptu purchase			0
athlete : @entity2 is known for her prowess in the equestrian field he said : ‘ i drove home , collected the lorry , drove back to @entity45 , picked up the dude and took him back to the yard			0
it was past one in the morning before we were done			0
’ @entity37 admits he did n’t have high hopes for the horse at the @entity13 at @entity60 two weeks ago			1
‘ i just felt the ground would be too soft , that the course was too demanding and the opposition too experienced , ’ he said			0
after the success , dude is believed to be worth £ 200,000 but @entity8 and his friends insist they have no plans to sell him			1
@entity8 said : ‘ @entity2 will take @entity12 over showjumping poles at home and improve his technique			2
’ his next racing outing could be at the @entity72 in march			0
@entity8 said : ‘ the soft ground and the undulating course suits dude well			2
’ he added : ‘ the whole thing is ridiculous			0
we ’re beginning to dream that we might one day do even better than the @entity13			2
‘ and it ’s all because people did n’t turn up to a sales night and i took their place with no plans to end the evening as an owner with a horse i knew nothing about , or even saw			0
you could n’t make it up , could you ? ’ he laughed			0
happy couple : @entity2 called her husband @entity8 an idiot for buying a racehorse without knowing anything it , but now has to eat her words			2
