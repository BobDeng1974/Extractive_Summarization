by @entity1 reporter published : 17:06 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 17:24 est , 1 february 2013 an @entity3 couple facing jail time for nursing an injured fawn back to health rather than leaving it to die could be granted a reprieve			2
the @entity8 has said that it will ask that charges be dismissed against @entity10 and @entity11 , who were charged with the illegal possession of a deer			1
the couple were each charged and faced 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine after they rescued the wounded fawn they named @entity18 and kept it for two years on their 17 - acre farm			1
@entity22 police officer @entity21 says he discovered the tiny deer curled up on a neighbor ’s front porch , badly wounded and unable to stand , while he was on patrol two years ago			2
reprieve : @entity10 and @entity11 face jail for taking in a wounded deer - but the charges could be dropped punishing : an @entity3 couple are facing criminal charges after they nursed this fawn back to health after finding it badly wounded near their home without time to help it himself , he called his wife , a registered nurse , who cautiously approached the deer with their teenager daughter before the fawn gently licked their hands			1
unbeknownst to them at the time , however , was that bringing the animal home with them was illegal according to the state 's @entity8 , with the crime punishable by jail			1
but news of the charges prompted a massive outpouring of online support for the couple , and an online petition demanding the charged be dropped received more than 30,000 signatures			1
' i had hopes that it would come out this way because it was obvious that much of the world saw the compassion of what we did and there was not criminal intent , ' @entity11 told the @entity70			2
gov. @entity71 asked the agency to reevaluate the case , and investigators asked the prosecutor to dismiss the charges			2
the @entity78 's office said it was waiting a statement from the @entity8 about where it stands on the case before going forward			2
good intentions : @entity10 and @entity11 , pictured , brought the deer home , naming it @entity18 , in hopes of one day releasing it back into the wild repercussions : the couple are accused of illegally possessing a white - tailed deer , a misdemeanor offense punishable with up to 60 days in jail and a fine up to $ 500 when mrs @entity94 first saw the deer in 2010 , she described it as having puncture wounds along its hips from a possible coyote attack			1
the wounds she said were maggot infested			0
if they left the animal there it would surely die , she reasoned			0
they called the @entity8 , who told them to take the animal out into the woods and leave it there			2
' she would have laid there and starved to death and had a miserable death , ' mrs @entity22 told the @entity70			0
instead they took the animal back to their 17 - acre farm and began caring for her , starting with a small bottle of goats milk , while giving her the name of @entity18			0
the @entity122 said the charges came after a six - month investigation by the department which included a half a dozen visits to their home and calls to local authorities			1
the family says they did n’t know at the time that it was illegal to keep the deer			0
the @entity8 offered to euthanize the deer , who was said to be posing a safety threat to humans			1
human threat : the @entity8 told them , @entity21 pictured , that they have to euthanize the deer with it now being a potential threat to human health ‘ i was devastated , ’ mrs @entity11 told @entity144 of her reaction			1
‘ i spent a year and several months nursing her into adulthood , getting to the point where she was able to go out on her own			0
no matter what the law is , we did what was right for the animal			0
' but on the day of @entity18 's scheduled execution they found the deer gone			0
the door to her outdoor enclosure was found hanging open			0
an incident report filed by the @entity8 lists @entity11 ’s 80 - year - old father as a suspect in the animal ’s release , but that ’s an allegation mrs @entity11 says they can not prove			1
the family says they did n't have a hand in @entity18 's escape but admit that they also did n't try too hard to find out how it happened			0
mr @entity21 only reasons that @entity18 had a good number of friends : ' she was very popular			0
