on the edge of @entity13 's woodlands , dozens of the city 's transients live in makeshift homes which they consider safer than homeless shelters			1
photographer @entity17 has captured some of the shanties in his thought - provoking photo essay , ' @entity21 ' , documenting the struggle , loneliness and ingenuity of @entity26 's people of the woods			1
the camps : snapper @entity17 has uncovered the illusive , hidden dwellings of @entity13 's homeless in his moving photographic series out of sight : @entity17 searched for secluded territories , learning where camps were likely to spring up behind various railroad tracks , @entity37 and fast food areas rough sleepers : @entity17 said some of the homeless people he spoke to preferred to sleep under a bridge than in a shelter which they considered unsafe desolate : @entity17 's photo series reveals the loneliness of many rough sleepers who chose to carve out their own lives using whatever materials they could get their hands on similar to his @entity53 series which captured lonely rowhouses around the @entity55 , @entity17 shot the shanties around @entity13 without their inhabitants to add to the ' mystery '			1
@entity17 said he first stumbled upon the homeless dwellings as he hiked through the woods bordering the city during hunting season			2
when he saw a ' mini-fortress ' made of milk crates just yards from a major thoroughfare , @entity17 began searching for other transients ' living off the grid '			1
most were based near railroad tracks , @entity37 , gas stations , and liquor stores			2
representative : the incredibly diverse style of shelters reflect the personal struggles and needs of their owners @entity79 touches : despite living on the outskirts of town , shelter owners often tried to make their space homely with greeting mats and flower vases inspiration : @entity17 was inspired to track down the city 's hidden dwellings after stumbling upon this makeshift home made up of stacked milk crates hidden in the bushes just yards from a major thoroughfare near downtown @entity13 while most of the camps @entity17 came across used basic tarps or tents , several were quite elaborate such as this home built entirely of wooden doors ' i have always been interested in the unique places people live in , particularly where there exists an element of defiance or desperation , or both			1
in these situations , a house can often reflect the dilemma of its owner			0
in the case of the hobo camps , this reflection is quite pronounced for obvious reasons , ' he told @entity115			0
' a sheet of plastic laid out over a clothesline may be the last stand for somebody who has either been rejected by society or who has refused to conform to whatever rules are being imposed on them			0
' several camp people i talked to said they would n't relocate into one of the @entity129 's shelters because they were afraid of being assaulted or having belongings stolen			0
' the road most traveled : most of the settlements @entity17 photographed were by waterways , railway tracks , @entity37 , gas stations and liquor stores mystery : @entity17 deliberately did n't photograph camp residents , instead focusing on how they lived , the mark they made and what they left behind slums : @entity17 came across a number of makeshift settlements or groups of people living off the grid around @entity13 @entity17 said about year after finishing the project , he returned to the woods to find all the camps were gone			1
one had burned to the ground , some had been bulldozed , while others moved to different locations			0
' my guess is that these , too , will not be around for long , ' he said			0
other @entity17 photographic collections can be viewed at his website benmarcinphotos.com or at @entity161 in @entity13 , @entity26			2
living off the grid : while some homes comprised a sheet over a branch , this settlement had a clothes line , barbecue and gym equipment out of the way : @entity17 captured each makeshift abode in full panorama view , showing their isolation and alienation traveling light : the dwellings @entity17 snapped have since been abandoned , demolished or burned to the ground homely : during his photographic odyssey , @entity17 became increasingly fascinated at the effort that went into remaining hidden in plain sight and the creativity involved hidden away : @entity17 said he found himself ' practically stepping into a number of homeless camps that were carefully hidden among strips of trees or bushes ' near highways and shopping centers no options : while several residents told @entity17 that living in a tent or sleeping on a mattress in the woods was a personal choice , it seemed to him that there was often no other choice			1

photographer @entity17 's series ' the camps ' captures makeshift settlements near railway lines , gas stations , @entity37 and bridges
he said many of @entity13 's homeless feel safer in the woods than in shelters
while most homes are made from tarps , some more elaborate *constructions* use milk crates and wooden doors
