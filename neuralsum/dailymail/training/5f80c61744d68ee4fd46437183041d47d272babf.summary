@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is still hopeful of an @entity3 recall , but the winger believes he will have to wait until current manager @entity5 has departed for that to happen			1
@entity0 won the last of his 34 caps in a 1 - 0 win against @entity12 in may 2012 , @entity5 's first game as @entity3 coach , and was also a non-playing part of @entity5 's @entity15 squad			1
but @entity0 told the @entity16 he does not expect the former @entity18 manager to pick him again			1
@entity0 looks on for @entity3 against @entity12 in 2012 , the last time he played for his country @entity0 ( right ) has started this season brightly and scored in @entity1 's 3 - 1 win against @entity21 @entity5 celebrates @entity3 's win over @entity23 earlier this month and has ignored @entity0 he said : ' i 'd never say my @entity3 career was over but , if i am realistic , i do n't think i will get a chance while @entity5 is in charge			1
' the only thing i can do is keep playing well and if injuries happen , you never know , he might change his mind			0
' if he does n't pick me that 's fair enough , it 's his opinion			2
he did pick me for the @entity34 but did n't play me and after that i did n't get selected again			2
he had n't really seen me but maybe i did n't fit into his systems or he wanted to go for younger players - i honestly do n't know			0
' i 'm still only 30 and maybe if i do n't get an opportunity under this @entity3 coach , it could still happen further down the line			2
it 's not only me			0
i thought @entity43 would have been in the last @entity3 squad			1
with respect to @entity46 , @entity43 has played consistently well in the @entity47 for a number of years			0
' @entity49 is another one who would maybe be disappointed not to have been called up but , like @entity43 , he 's young enough to get his chance one day , if he keeps playing well			0
' @entity5 picked youngsters like @entity52 's @entity46 for the qualifier against @entity23 @entity0 has begun this season brightly , scoring in a 3 - 1 win over @entity21 before the @entity1 were beaten 3 - 1 at home by @entity56			1
@entity58 's team take on @entity59 at the @entity60 on monday , and @entity62 striker @entity61 , a Â£ 12million summer signing , is expected to make his first @entity47 start , while @entity65 is set to make his debut following his loan move from @entity68			1
@entity0 was pleased with @entity1 's summer signings , but knows his side are in for a tough match against @entity59			1
@entity1 face @entity59 on monday , with @entity73 manager @entity72 keen on replacing @entity74 as @entity76 boss he added : ' the transfer window was good for us			1
we have good competition in all places now whereas for large parts of last season the team was basically picking itself			0
' the pleasing thing now , although it might be a headache for the manager , is picking the team			0
he has options in all positions now but i 'm sure he would rather have it this way than having to play people out of position , as he was forced to do last season			0
' the players , particularly the strikers who have come in , are different to what we 've had in the past though and i believe that the team , as a result , has to change the way we play			0
' @entity59 will be a tough game though			2
they 've bought well and @entity72 is a good manager			0

@entity0 believes @entity3 boss @entity5 will not pick him again
