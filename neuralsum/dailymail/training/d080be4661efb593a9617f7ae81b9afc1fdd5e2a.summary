@entity11 may get her wish , too			2
on friday , the state filed a motion to close her case			0
however , mr @entity9 is n't getting his hopes up too fast			2
' we have come to learn actions speak louder than words , ” he told @entity66			0
the @entity9 's trying ordeal began 16 months ago when they submitted their daughter for evaluation at @entity71			1
@entity8 and @entity9 lost custody of their 16 - year - old daughter when she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder last year			1
before that diagnosis , they had been paying for her to get treatment for a rare genetic disease @entity11 ’s case has gained attention after a diagnostic dispute between her doctors at @entity85 and at @entity14 over whether her deteriorating condition was primarily a physical or a psychiatric problem			1
she was being treated at @entity20 for more than a year for mitochondrial disease , a group of genetic disorders that affect how cells produce energy , often causing problems with the gut , brain , muscles , and heart			1
however , doctors at @entity14 took a different view and concluded that her physical symptoms were primarily caused by psychological disorders			1
after the conflicting diagnosis , doctors allegedly gave @entity11 's parents the bewildering and heart - breaking news that they would n't be able to take their daughter home			1
@entity11 was released from @entity14 early this year , but has not been allowed to go home yet @entity11 ’s parents refused to accept that her condition was psychological in nature and tried to discharge her and bringing her back to @entity20			1

' they told me that @entity139 did not exist , ' says @entity8 , a financial planner			2
' instead , they said she had @entity143 , which is effectively a stress - related mental problem			0
' they said she had been misdiagnosed , overmedicated and forced to undergo unnecessary procedures			0
it was as though they were accusing us of needlessly harming our daughter			0
' mr @entity9 says the idea for the video was completely his daughters			2
she recorded with one of her sisters experts claim one in every 2,000 children in the @entity160 suffer from @entity139 , which saps energy , causes intestine and organ problems and gets progressively worse with age			0
the disease is hard to diagnose and , according to the @entity168 support group , parents have been suspected of child abuse and sufferers accused of somatization disorders or fabricating pain			2
meanwhile , @entity143 is considered to be anxiety - related with sufferers feeling real pain that can not be medically explained			0
between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and 0.2 per cent of men in the @entity160 have been diagnosed as sufferers			0
