the season has n't even started yet , but @entity1 has already had his say about @entity4 's busy schedule			1
speaking in @entity6 ahead of saturday 's pre-season friendly against @entity8 , the @entity4 manager said : ' a @entity9 year is always very difficult and short			1
' the @entity11 final was july 13 and the start of the @entity13 is august 16			1
it looks impossible to me			0
' a @entity9 year is always very difficult for every big club because the players have been away			1
' but does he have a point ? he has already revealed his @entity11 winning trio of @entity30 , @entity28 and @entity27 are likely to miss the season opener against @entity34			1
while big money new signings @entity23 and @entity24 are yet to even start pre-season training due to their @entity11 exertions			1
here , @entity52 looks at the length of time @entity1 will have with his players before the big kick - off on august 16			1

per mertesacker - due back from august 11 has been keeping himself fit during his summer holidays but just five days of training before the @entity34 clash is unlikely to be enough			2
available : @entity75 ( right ) does not have any international commitments and has travelled to the @entity19 @entity86 - due back from aug 1 will be a key player for the @entity89 next season , but @entity1 is yet to spend any time with his central defender yet this summer			2
@entity92 - due back from aug 2 @entity1 will have to wait until next month to gave face - to - face talks with the @entity94 over his uncertain future			0
wantaway : @entity92 will have showdown talks with boss @entity1 when he returns for pre-season @entity98 - returned on july 7 many say he was unlucky not to be not he plane to @entity69 , but @entity102 's loss has been @entity4 's gain			2
@entity104 - returned on july 7 has lost his place in @entity107 's plans , but a full pre-season could help him regain his international place			0
fresh : left - back @entity98 was not selected by @entity112 for @entity102 so has had a full pre-season @entity114 - returned on july 7 his failure to secure a single cap for @entity107 remains a mystery , but @entity1 will be glad to have his midfielder on board			2
@entity120 - returned on july 7 like @entity121 and @entity122 , may never get the chance to showcase his talents on the biggest stage , but at least @entity4 have him for the whole summer			0
key : @entity120 enjoyed a wonderful season last year and he has been able to complete a full pre-season big stage : @entity120 ( right ) is unlikely to represent @entity130 at a major tournament @entity132 : @entity114 ( left ) will be ready and available for @entity4 's season opener with @entity34 @entity134 - returned on july 7 there was talk of an international recall for the @entity138 last year but it did n't materialise			1

the summer will be vital to the @entity138 in his pursuit of consistent fitness next term			0

@entity151 - returned july 7 the @entity153 's failure to qualify for the @entity11 will result in the midfielder having a full pre-season under his belt			2

fit : @entity4 benefited from @entity102 's early @entity11 exit as @entity162 has been at pre-season @entity178 - returned on july 20 @entity107 's unexpected early exit from the @entity11 means the diminutive forward has returned far earlier than expected			0
@entity27 - due back from august 11 part of the @entity26 trio that will returned just five days before the season - opener against @entity34			1
back : @entity107 were eliminated from the @entity11 early so @entity178 is on the pre-season tour @entity30 - due back from august 11 after a inconsistent first season with @entity4 , manager @entity1 would have wanted more time with his record signing during pre-season			1
@entity190 back from august 1 the club 's central striker played second fiddle to @entity194 at the @entity11 , so should be raring to go when he reports back			0
