stores are set to cut back on @entity2 discounts this year to avoid another ‘ delivery tsunami ’			1
the idea of @entity2 has been imported from @entity5 , where retailers offer big discounts to kick start the @entity9 shopping season			1
however , it proved a disaster in @entity12 last year with long queues and violent scenes which saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security			1
the web stores trade body , @entity21 , has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle @entity2 this year after a catastrophe in 2014 at the same time , many online stores were simply unable to cope with the rush of orders with the result that a huge delivery backlog was created			1
many retailers were also disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in december , rather than generating any extra business			0
the web stores trade body , @entity21 , has warned retailers that they will have to fundamentally rethink how they handle @entity2 this year			1
significantly , it said : ‘ @entity2 can be very profitable for retailers who get it right , but discount rates will need to be rationalised and panic - discounting avoided			1
’ it suggests stores might want to spread the discounts and promotion over a longer period , perhaps a weekend or week , in order to avoid the spike in orders			2
firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal , or set up alternative click and collect services			0
scenes of violence : cutomers fought tooth and nail to make the most of discount deals on black friday			0
the scale of the event greatly exceeded everyone ’s expectations for many the scenes of chaos did n't pay off			2
some retailers were disappointed to find the event merely brought forward sales that would have happened later in december , rather than generating any extra business the @entity21 said : ‘ the scale of @entity2 2014 greatly exceeded everyone ’s expectations , which meant a large number of online orders were compressed into a far shorter period of time than anticipated – triggering an online retail ‘ delivery tsunami ’			1
‘ this heavily impacted carrier and retailer fulfilment operations and normal activity suffered for days afterwards			0
’ @entity81 , head of e-logistics at @entity21 , said : ‘ the huge surge in demand on @entity2 2014 was unprecedented and caught everyone in the industry by surprise			2
fevered and bullish behaviour in retail outlets saw the police criticising supermarkets for failing to put in place proper security ‘ the exact form of it may evolve in 2015 , but at least this time we have a precedent and time to develop strategies to ensure the @entity9 peak runs as efficiently as possible			0
‘ it ’s fair to say that @entity2 splits opinion , but the impact of it is so vast that it affects all retailers whether they run campaigns or not			0
‘ the key points for industry to address are around how to smooth out the spike – even spreading it over a few days would make a massive difference to fulfilment operations – and managing expectation so that customers receive accurate and up - to - date information about the progress of their orders			0
’ firms should also ensure they have sufficient couriers to cope and warn customers that deliveries may take longer than normal , or set up alternative click and collect services , the @entity21 said .			0
