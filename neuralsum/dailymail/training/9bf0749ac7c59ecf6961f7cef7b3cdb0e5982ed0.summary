upturn : @entity1 has revealed a 32 % rise in profits a year after its boss @entity4 promised to stop ' p * * * * * * off ' passengers @entity1 's profits have soared by 32 per cent as its loud - mouth boss @entity4 admitted : ' being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy '			1
charging an average of five per cent more for tickets and getting more people on planes also helped push profits to £ 621million for the six months to the end of september			1
@entity1 now expects its annual profits of up to £ 602million , a rise of 18 per cent on a previous estimate the good news could mean the end of @entity4 's series of extreme schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers , including demanding up to £ 5 to use the toilet and vertical seats to get more people on board			1
he said today : ' being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy for me and @entity1			1
our service left something to be desired 12 months ago			2
' it 's a new - found experience i must admit for me , but if it works this well i wish i 'd been nicer to our customers much earlier			1
it 's better late than never '			0
passengers today described his change of heart as the ' slowest penny drop in history '			0
earlier this year , after two profits warnings , mr @entity4 's promised that the company would ' stop unnecessarily p * * * * * * people off ' and treating customers ' like the enemy '			1
@entity4 agreed to partially end the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost £ 5 , relax the airline 's draconian baggage allowance rules and a ' sophisticated ' business service			1
it also vowed to cut average fares by up to 10 per cent as part of a bid to fly an additional five million passengers over the winter period			0
upward part : @entity1 says profits up because of a new ' touchy feely ' attitude to customers and also higher average fares and more people on board the @entity70 - based carrier believes there are ' many opportunities ' open to it , such as competing more vigorously at primary airports and in attracting business traffic which tends to travel more during the winter period			1
@entity1 said average fares will fall by between three per cent and five per cent in the current quarter before an aggressive promotional drive will cut fares by between six per cent and 10 per cent in the new year			2
as a result , the airline expects to carry 89 million customers in the year to march 31 , a rise of 9 per cent on a year earlier and the second such upgrade since september			1
average fares will be up by 1 per cent to 47 euros ( £ 36.76 ) across the year as a result of higher prices over the @entity87 period			2
the profits boost came after @entity1 had to give a unprecedented two profits warnings in the past 12 months			1
@entity4 said to turn them around he would end the airline 's ' over-abrupt ' , ' go to hell ' culture			1
in 2012 he launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers – branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘ idiots ’ who should ‘ b * * * * * off ’			1
her said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘ stupid ’ and it is right they are charged £ 60 a time to have one printed at the check - in desk because it is their ‘ f * * * up ’			0
outspoken : mr @entity4 , who has gained areputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of @entity1 foralmost 20 years			2
he has seen it through two decades of extraordinarygrowth pay - per - pee in 2009 , mr @entity113 announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight			0
' we ’re thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny			0
' when asked if he would charge more than a pound , he replied : ' if someone wanted to pay £ 5 to go to the toilet i would carry them myself			2
i would wipe their bums for a fiver			0
' vertical seats a year later , the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats , akin to bar stools with seatbelts			0
his theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats , flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent			0
who needs co-pilots ? mr @entity4 once remarked that co-pilots were only there to ' make sure the first fella does n’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls '			0
he said aviation authorities should axe the ' unnecessary ' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as ' back - up ' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight			0
mr @entity4 , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of @entity1 for almost 20 years			2
but in the past 12 months , under pressure over customer service , he has said he wants to change his ways			1
last autumn a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on @entity166 after agreeing to host a question - and - answer session from customers			0
he posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets			0
many customers told mr @entity4 what an ' a * * * hole ' they thought he was - with user @entity175 asking him : ' have you by any chance just hired @entity180 's former head of publicity you @entity179 '			2
the @entity1 boss replied : ' hey , do n't call me plum			0
pudding would be more accurate ! ' , before later admitting : ' i 'm an a * * * hole			0
but they still love me			0
' @entity1 remains one of the worst brands in the world by customers , second only to insurance company @entity192			1
