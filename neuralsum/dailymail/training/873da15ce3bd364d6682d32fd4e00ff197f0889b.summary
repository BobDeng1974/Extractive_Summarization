by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it seems that @entity3 can boast the strongest left - wing in the land after they fielded a team made - up entirely of socialist revolutionaries in a pre-season friendly			1
well that is how it appeared according to their @entity12 account anyway as they released a line - up containing @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 because they could not name the triallists on display			0
@entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 were also giving a starting place , while @entity25 and @entity26 could only make the bench against @entity28 on @entity29 left - wingers : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) were two of the pseudonyms of socialist revolutionaries that were used by @entity3 during their pre-season friendly with @entity28 to replace triallists ' names revolutionary : @entity3 's @entity12 account have used pseudonyms instead of triallists names on @entity12 tv : games of @entity43 characters were used for one friendly , and socialist revolutionaries for another benched : the tongue - in - cheek inclusion of @entity17 as a left - wing revolutionary saw him only make the bench it was a strike from @entity3 's @entity50 , and not from any of his revolutionary team - mates , that broke the deadlock before @entity53 popped up with a second in a 2 - 2 draw			1
@entity3 's official @entity12 account replaced the names of triallists during their match against @entity60 on tuesday as well , but on that occasion they used @entity43 characters as pseudonyms			2
household names from the popular @entity66 programme who were supposedly on display included @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
unfortunately the ' cast ' from @entity72 succumbed to a 4 - 2 defeat away at @entity60 despite strikes from @entity70 and @entity3 's @entity75			1
the @entity77 club were relegated from the @entity79 last season after finished bottom of the league and will look to bounce back at the first time of asking from the @entity83 this campaign			0
fictional : @entity43 character @entity69 was one of the pseudonyms used by @entity3 against @entity60 supporter extroadinaire : @entity89 fan @entity88 appears in the @entity66 programme as @entity91			0
