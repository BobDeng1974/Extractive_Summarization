and the star is not alone , as a @entity31 analysis of all 19.1million home sales carried out since 1995 found @entity4 , where where the @entity7 training ground is based , topped the league for the greatest price increases			1
often dubbed the @entity37 of @entity15 , @entity4 and @entity38 are also home to @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity45 singer @entity44 and @entity46 , while residents pay more income tax than any other area of the @entity15			1
like @entity6 , who built his nine - bedroom second home on the site of an older house , many newly - built mansions have taken the place of older homes - often built in the 1930s when @entity4 started to attract commuters			1
' we 've seen properties built for just the land they 're standing on and then demolished and a much bigger home built in their place , ' estate agent @entity59 , who works in the area , told the @entity31			0
other @entity5 idylls also experienced huge price increases in the last 20 years , with homes in @entity71 - where @entity72 's new left back @entity73 grew up , rising by an average of £ 588,000 and taking second place on the list			1
tucked between the two , @entity77 was fourth in the table , with values soaring by £ 530,000			0

in @entity87 , homes have shot up by £ 466,000 , while in @entity89 the figure is £ 431,000			0

home from home : @entity6 had built the nine bedroom white mansion next door to his former red - brick home outside of @entity5 , homes in @entity111 in @entity112 are now £ 550,000 more expensive than a decade ago , and in @entity114 in @entity115 buyers can expect to pay an extra £ 500,000			1
all but one of the top ten are in the stockbroker - belt surrounding @entity96 , with @entity119 and @entity120 in @entity121 also experiencing booming prices			1
both areas are popular with @entity125 stars , past and present , such as @entity126 , @entity127 and assistant manager @entity128 , no doubt due to their proximity to the @entity132 ' training ground at @entity133			0
