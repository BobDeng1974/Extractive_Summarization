by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:15 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 11 july 2013 the nuclear deterrent base in @entity3 would be designated as sovereign @entity5 territory under plans drawn up by the @entity7			1
the move comes amid warnings of the ‘ enormous ’ costs of trying to relocate the @entity12 missile system away from @entity13 if @entity3 breaks away from the rest of the @entity5			1
but @entity15 today moved to quash the idea , warning it was not a ‘ credible or sensible ’			1
one the move ? one of the @entity21 's @entity20 attack submarines sailing into the naval base on the @entity23 the future of @entity5 ’s nuclear deterrent has become a key area of dispute in the run up to the referendum on @entity3 independence next year			1
the submarines and missiles are housed at a naval base on the @entity23 but the @entity34 wants rid of the system			1
officials in @entity37 have been looking at alternatives to ensure @entity5 can maintain its at sea deterrent			2
under the plan to reclassify @entity13 , the base would be given the same status as the @entity5 sovereign military bases in @entity45 , the @entity40 reported			2
a defence source said : ‘ it would cost a huge amount of money , running into tens of billions of pounds , to decommission @entity13			0
warning : @entity50 made clear that @entity15 did not think the plan was sensible ‘ those costs would be factored into any negotiations on an independence settlement			0
the sovereign base area is an option			0
it is an interesting idea because the costs of moving out of @entity13 are eye - wateringly high			0
’ the government has always officially insisted it is not working on alternative options for siting @entity12 because it expects @entity3 to vote to stay in the @entity5			1
earlier this month defence secretary @entity62 warned that moving the base for the continuous at - sea nuclear deterrent would ‘ cost a significant amount of money ’			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ no contingency plans are being made to move @entity12 out of @entity3			1
the scale and cost of any potential relocation away from @entity13 would be enormous			0
’ however , @entity50 today insisted mr @entity15 would not support proposals to designate the @entity74 home of the @entity12 nuclear deterrent as sovereign @entity5 territory			2
a @entity78 spokesman said that no such idea had been presented to mr @entity15 or to defence secretary @entity62 , adding that it would not be a " credible or sensible " course of action			2
@entity34 defence spokesman @entity83 described the sovereign territory idea as ‘ an extraordinary attempt by @entity86 to bully @entity3 ’			1
mr @entity83 added : ‘ neither the people nor @entity88 want nuclear weapons dumped here , and we are clear that @entity12 would have to be removed as quickly as possible - only a @entity93 vote next september will empower @entity3 to get rid of @entity12 , and the money saved will help build a fairer society and stronger economy			0
‘ a key argument for independence is that @entity3 will no longer have to pay for nuclear weapons that we do not want			0
a no vote , by contrast , means a new generation of nuclear weapons on the @entity23 for another 50 years			0

idea *floated* as a contingency if @entity3 breaks away from the @entity5
but @entity107 says it is not ' credible or sensible '
@entity34 *accused* @entity86 of trying to bully @entity3
