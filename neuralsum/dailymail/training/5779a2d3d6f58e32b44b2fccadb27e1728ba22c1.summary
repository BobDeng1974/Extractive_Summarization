the last time @entity1 won at the @entity2 , @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ was no 1 , @entity0 were in the process of releasing 250,000 @entity7 diplomatic cables and @entity8 was wreaking the sort of havoc at @entity11 that was n't rectified for years			1
it was also around that period that a certain @entity13 began to make good on his early promise and become a driving force for @entity1			1
his goal , at 2 - 0 down , proved the catalyst to three precious points			1
@entity20 equalised before @entity21 notched a late winner			0
since then , however , @entity1 have stagnated			1
they ’re on a third manager since @entity24 departed and do n’t appear to be capable of touching the top four just yet			0
as we embark on the first @entity27 of this season , @entity25 picks a composite xi of @entity30 and @entity1 ahead of the clash			1
both are exemplary shot stoppers , but the @entity48 ’s savvy reading of the game in acting as a sweeper pips it			0
@entity48 international @entity41 trumps @entity42 to take the gloves in our composite xi right - back : @entity55 is n’t a right - back , but neither club are blessed with genuine quality in that area			1
@entity60 is very impressive when play is ahead of him – already an astute reader of the game – and he ’s no slouch going the other way			0
summer signing @entity55 has made an impressive start to his @entity30 career @entity71 defender : per @entity72 carries on surprising people			2
the poster boy for @entity30 ’s failings during his first season , @entity72 has relished the opportunity to go and dominate @entity79 defenders after @entity38 ’s decision to drop his back four a touch deeper			1
there is a strong argument for @entity86 ’s inclusion but the @entity87 is more consistent			0
per @entity72 is a commanding presence at the heart of @entity30 's defence @entity71 defender : @entity91 still has a mistake in his locker every now and then but @entity91 ’s pace and bravery make him quite the asset			1
on his day one of the best in the division			0
it is a shame from an @entity30 point of view that his day is n’t every week			2
@entity91 also makes our composite team and will play alongside mertesacker left - back : @entity106 take away the injuries and here we have @entity109 ’s best left - back			2
this is judged merely on ability – not taking into account fitness problems – and @entity106 is able to join in while also an intelligent defender , rarely committing before his winger			0
@entity106 gets the nod at left - back and is an accomplished and intelligent player @entity71 midfielder : @entity119 might not be everybody ’s cup of tea in midfield , but is powerful enough to make an impact on the @entity79			2
when you consider his main rival from a @entity129 perspective is the passive @entity130 , there is definitely room for the £ 9million summer signing from @entity132			2
brings much - needed steel to the side			2
@entity119 brings steel to the centre of @entity1 's midfield @entity71 midfielder : @entity139 has enjoyed a decent start to the season , despite his ludicrously harsh critics			1
off the field problems are admittedly @entity139 ’s own fault , but his performances are steadily improving			0
there ’s still much to do if he is to become the blockbuster midfielder once tipped			0
@entity139 has made a decent start to the season for @entity30 but still attracts criticism attacking midfielder : @entity153 a close call between the @entity155 and @entity156 , but @entity153 pips him purely because he positively affects more games			1
the 22 - year - old ’s vision around the box is a joy to watch , while you always believe there is a purpose to his play			2
@entity156 , even though he has started brightly this term , can flit in and out			0
@entity153 gets the pick ahead of @entity156 in the attacking midfield slot attacking midfielder : @entity170 simply put : a superstar			0
@entity170 is @entity30 ’s proper game - changing midfielder , popping up with vital goals and capable of driving the @entity129 forward			1
head and shoulders above the rest on either side			0
@entity170 has turned in consistently brilliant performances for @entity30 over the last couple of seasons attacking midfielder : @entity181 clearly needs time to settle into @entity183 football , but showing signs that he is the match - winner @entity38 thought he was buying after the @entity186			1
free - kick in midweek was stunning but it is nose for goal in the box that should shine through			0
given the opportunity to play more central @entity181 ’s pace and clever running could see him fire @entity30 to more trophies			2
@entity181 has made a storming start to his @entity30 career and scored a cracking free - kick in midweek striker : @entity199 wanted by @entity1 in the close season , @entity199 would get into either of these teams			1
is forever a willing runner and - if he spends extra time finessing his finishing at @entity205 - could prove to be a snip at £ 16million			0
@entity207 does n’t make the bench			0
@entity199 celebrates scoring for @entity30 in their 3 - 0 win at @entity212 last weekend @entity213 concentrating on performance not history			1

@entity30 meet @entity1 in the @entity27 on *saturday* night
spurs have not *tasted* success at the @entity2 since november 2010
@entity30 did the *double* over them last season and won 2 - 0 in @entity224
eight @entity129 players make our xi , compared to three from @entity1
