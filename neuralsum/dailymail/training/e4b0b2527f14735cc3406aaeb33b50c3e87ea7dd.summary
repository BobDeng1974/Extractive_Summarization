sixteen and 17 - year - olds will be allowed to vote within a year of the next election , @entity1 leader @entity0 pledged last night			1
mr @entity0 said the government would change the law to lower the voting age from may 2016			2
such a move – the first change in the national voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17 - year - olds			1
it comes after the voting age was lowered for the first time in the @entity14 referendum in september			2
‘ that ’s because too often young people do n’t get a look - in with politicians who know they ca n’t vote - or assume that they wo n’t vote			2
‘ the measures we will introduce in our first year of government represent the greatest extension of the franchise in my lifetime			0
‘ but it is not enough just to give young people the right to vote			0
we must do everything we can to ensure they have the chance to exercise it			0
' mr @entity0 , who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age , is expected to use a speech at next week ’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto			1
party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote @entity1			1
the idea is also backed by the @entity52			0
the voting age in @entity54 was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969			2
@entity56 chairman @entity55 has previously dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year			1
mr @entity55 warned the move would ‘ politicise the classroom , with votes for youngsters who are still at school ’			0
he also accused @entity1 of bowing to the demands of its union paymasters over the issue			0
last year @entity69 , which is @entity1 ’s biggest donor , demanded that 16 - year - olds should be given the vote			1
the union , run by @entity74 , said : ‘ young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16			2
’ an exit poll of just over 2,000 @entity14 voters by @entity56 peer lord @entity81 showed that the 16 and 17 - year - olds enfranchised for the first time by the @entity14 referendum were overwhelmingly in favour of independence			1
the small sample – which may not have been representative of teenagers overall – showed that 71 per cent of the age group voted yes			0
in contrast , only 27 per cent of over- 65s voted in favour of independence in lord @entity81 ’s sample			0
the figures suggest that school pupils are indeed more likely to vote for radical options placed in front of them			0
but this did not carry through to the next age group – the split between @entity103 for 18 - to 24 - year - olds was virtually even in the exit poll .			1

@entity0 pledged to lower voting age to 16 in conference speech
the move would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17 - year - olds
party sources believe youngsters are more likely to vote @entity1 than @entity56
