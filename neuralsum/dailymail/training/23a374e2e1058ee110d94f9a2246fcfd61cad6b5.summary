by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 18 january 2013 half - naked pictures of @entity4 ’s third husband @entity3 should not be published to protect the actress ' young children , a judge said today			1
explaining his decision to ban a newspaper printing the embarrassing pictures of mr @entity3 , mr justice @entity7 said there was a ' real risk ' that miss @entity4 's daughter and son would be ridiculed at school			1
the ' innocent but embarrassing ' photographs were taken of mr @entity3 at a private fancy dress party with an ' outrageous ' theme more than two years ago , the @entity16 had heard			1
@entity4 and her new husband @entity3 went to @entity21 's @entity16 to stop the pictures being printed they were taken by party guest @entity24 in july 2010 and posted on his @entity26 account			1
the @entity27 had argued that publication of the ' semi-naked photos ' would be justified because mr @entity3 - who changed his name from @entity31 - was a public figure			2
mr @entity3 , 34 , who was previously married to @entity34 's daughter @entity33 , used to work as ' @entity35 ' for the space travel branch of his uncle 's @entity38 empire before becoming a sheep farmer			2
the judge said : ' mr @entity3 ’s employment with @entity43 comes nowhere to placing him in that narrow category of persons who , although engaged in no public office , may be regarded as having reduced expectations of privacy due to their important role in national affairs			0
' they may include the chairmen of major public companies and the captains of national sporting teams , but mr @entity3 was , so far as the evidence goes at this stage , no more than a not very conspicuous middle manager in his uncle ’s private business empire			0
' in any event , that role ceased some two years ago			0
' mr @entity7 ruled in favour of mr @entity3 in a written judgment published yesterday , the judge added : ' mr @entity3 has , inevitably , briefly become something of a public figure as a result of his relationship with , and now marriage to , miss @entity4			1
' to some unavoidable degree this has led to published photographs of them together , but not so as to place mr @entity3 in the public sphere in his own right			0
' mr @entity3 , who is miss @entity4 's third husband , had argued he was not a role model and was a ' relative nobody ' before his marriage to @entity82			1
his lawyers said publication would be a breach of privacy , would not be in the public interest , and could lead to miss @entity4 ’s daughter and son being bullied			1
lawyers for the @entity27 said the images revealed conduct which ' some people might legitimately regard it as being unacceptable behaviour '			0
and newspaper editors said they would pixelate any the parts of photographs which showed the ' lower half ' of mr @entity3 ’s body			0
but mr justice @entity7 said that while the photographs showed him partially naked and engaged in ' rather silly , schoolboy - like behaviour ' , they were taken at a private party and he was not expecting them to be made public			1
he also said publication of them could harm the children 's relationship with their mother 's new husband			2
won his fight : lawyers for mr @entity3 had argued in @entity21 's @entity16 that he was not a public figure he said : ' there is in my view good reason to suppose that , if the photographs or a description of their content were published ... there is real reason to think that a grave risk would arise as to miss @entity4 ’s children being subjected to teasing or ridicule at school about the behaviour of their newly acquired stepfather , within a short period after his arrival within their family , and that such teasing or ridicule could be seriously damaging to the caring relationship which , on the evidence , the claimant is seeking to establish with them			1
' after mr justice @entity7 ruled against @entity27 publisher @entity139 on january 8 , miss @entity4 said she aimed to maintain privacy and refused to accept that her family could not lead a ' relatively normal life '			1
miss @entity4 and mr @entity3 , who married in @entity143 last month , said in a statement : ' we have stopped @entity27 from publishing semi-naked photos of @entity3 taken by a friend at a private 21st birthday party a few years ago			1
' the photos are innocent but embarrassing and there is no reason to splash them across a newspaper			2
' we recognise that in the internet age privacy is harder and harder to maintain			0
' but we will continue to do what we can , particularly to protect @entity4 ’s children from the results of media intrusion			2
' we refuse to accept that her career means our family ca n’t live a relatively normal life			0
' no detail of what the photographs showed emerged at the public hearing earlier this month			0
the judge heard evidence about detail in the photographs in private			0
mr @entity7 was told at the hearing earlier this month that the dispute over publication rights could be fully aired at a @entity16 trial			1
and he banned publication pending any trial			2
but lawyers for both sides told the judge yesterday that there would be no trial			0
they said mr @entity3 and the @entity27 had now agreed an undisclosed settlement of the litigation .			0

mr @entity7 explained why he banned publication of pictures of miss @entity4 's new husband
he said the @entity192 - winning actress ' young children might have been ridiculed over ' innocent but embarrassing ' party photos
