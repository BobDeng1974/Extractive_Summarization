a principal and his wife have been sacked from a college whose stated aim is to promote multiculturalism because they are white @entity5 , they claim			2
professor @entity7 , 47 , says he was dismissed from the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , because his race and religion were seen by his superiors as a threat to its core @entity16 values			1
he says the college ’s claims to pursuing multicultural values were a charade and that he was dismissed so he could be replaced by a @entity16			1
his wife @entity21 , 42 , alleges she was forced from her position as head of the @entity25 language centre because she attracted too many students who were not @entity16 or @entity27			1
dismissed : @entity7 and his wife @entity28 say @entity8 's claim to promote multiculturalism was a charade the independent college , whose patron is @entity35 , the @entity36 of @entity37 , advertises itself as a research - led institution ' that promotes a greater understanding of different religions and cultures in a multicultural context , for the benefit of the wider community '			1
the couple are taking the college to an employment tribunal claiming racial and religious discrimination , and unfair dismissal			2
mrs @entity21 is also claiming sex discrimination after she was suspended and later dismissed apparently because she is married to prof @entity50			2
the couple , from @entity52 , were marched off the college grounds in june and have not been allowed to return since			2
they claim they were given no reason for their suspensions and were dismissed in november despite no evidence of any wrongdoing			2
the couple have also lodged grievances against the chancellor of the @entity63 – a @entity65 peer and close friend of former prime minister @entity67 - for his handling of what they describe as a ‘ sham ’ disciplinary process			2
agenda ? the couple say the college , which is sponsored by the @entity37 royal family , wanted more @entity16 students sheikh @entity35 , the deputy ruler of @entity37 , is patron of the college prof @entity50 and his wife began working at the college eight and four years ago respectively , choosing to marry on the campus last year			1
however , they believe their attempts at pushing it in a more cosmopolitan direction angered their superiors			0
prof @entity50 said his suspension came just days after he changed the college ’s name from the ‘ @entity86 for @entity88 and @entity89 studies ’			0
the couple allege that @entity91 , the director of operations , and @entity93 , chairman of its board of directors and private secretary to the @entity35 , decided to force them out because they were @entity99 , white and @entity100			0
prof @entity50 told the @entity101 : ' it is clear to me that there is collusion between these two individuals that i should be removed from my position on the basis that i am not an @entity27 and not a @entity16 and that the person who has the role of principal should be @entity27 and / or @entity16			1
' multiculturalism and respect for cultural and religious differences are , i had thought , core values of the college			0
' however , i believe that such inclusive multiculturalism no longer fits the particular type of multicultural vision of certain managers and the chairman , that is accepting of different cultures , so long as the majority of students are @entity16 and / or @entity27 and the ethos is distinctly @entity89			1
' my face and lack of @entity16 faith no longer fit			1
' mrs @entity21 says mr @entity91 also wanted her removed from her position because she had attracted too many @entity131 and @entity132 students , who were n't @entity16 , to her @entity25 course at the college , which receives no public funding			1
she said : ' some are from @entity27 and other @entity16 backgrounds			1
however , a substantial number are from other parts of the world and other cultures			0
' i believe mr @entity91 does not feel happy with us recruiting students from these backgrounds as it does not fit the particular multicultural vision he has for @entity25 language			0
' the only times mr @entity91 has encouraged me to bring in students to @entity25 language are when they are @entity27 or @entity16			1
the two teachers were even married on the college 's campus before they were sacked the college was until recently known as the @entity86 for @entity88 and @entity89 studies ' i believe that mr @entity91 ’s discrimination against me , because i am not @entity16 , i am not @entity27 , and i am also a woman – and because i have brought a number of non @entity16 / non-arab students to the college – is a significant reason for my suspension			1
' despite a waiting list for places on its @entity25 language courses , the college closed the department last month , leaving its two remaining tutors redundant at @entity164			0
the college , which operates as a charity in partnership with the @entity167 , advertises in its prospectus that ' multiculturalism is at the centre of our vision and structure '			0
' our multicultural ethos is visibly translated and implemented in our day - to - day operation			0
our staff and students come from diverse national , cultural and religious backgrounds including @entity16 and non-muslims , ' it says			1
a spokesman for the college said : ' we can confirm that we have been notified that @entity185 proceedings have been raised in the name of professor @entity7 and his wife , @entity187			2
' @entity189 , an independent , not - for - profit charity , places diversity , religious pluralism and multiculturalism firmly at the core of its @entity196 programmes – and its day - to - day activities , ' the spokesman said			0
' the @entity8 will vigorously defend its reputation as a centre of excellence within the higher dducation sector and the good name it has won over the last ten years here in @entity9 , nationally and internationally			0
' professor @entity50 was dismissed from his post as principal at the college following a period of suspension on full pay and an inquiry conducted by the @entity211			0
' contingency plans were put in place to ensure the continued smooth running of the college			0
' we are in consultation with our team of legal advisers and , as a result , we are not in a position to discuss the matter further at this stage			0

@entity7 says he was forced out by @entity225 because he was ' not an @entity27 and not a @entity16 '
