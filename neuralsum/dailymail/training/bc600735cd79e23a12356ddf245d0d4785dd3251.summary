@entity2 's @entity1 could soon replace your @entity4 card and subway card as well as your credit card , it has been revealed			1
the firm last week launched @entity9 , which allows people to pay by tapping their phone and using a fingerprint on its home button to identify themselves			2
now it is believed to be in talks to open up the technology to other uses			2
consumers may use whatever credit cards they 'd like			2
while the system appears seamless , retailer opposition is a serious hurdle for the @entity29 giant @entity9 is compatible with the @entity1 , @entity30 and the @entity31			1
the mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity4 button			1
this confirms the person 's identity , and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card			0
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			2
if an @entity1 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity1 service			1
according to the report in @entity52 , @entity2 's is planning to replace transit cards , like the ones that the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 subway and train systems use			1
' the @entity2 representatives have talked to technology providers like @entity64 and @entity65 , which enable secure access to buildings and transit fare systems , respectively , ' people briefed on the discussions told the information			1
' spokespeople for the companies declined to comment about any discussions with @entity2 , but executives there discussed how they could integrate their systems with the @entity1			1
' @entity2 has already announced one partnership along these lines with @entity78 , which allows visitors to use an @entity31 instead of a keycard , but this will employ bluetooth technology rather than @entity83			1
however , @entity9 has not been without its issues			0
@entity85 and @entity86 have joined a long list of the world 's largest retailers who will not be accepting @entity9			2
at its launch , @entity2 boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your @entity1 and a tap of your finger to prove your identity			1
but retail giants @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 's			0
@entity104 are not among them			0
these retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme			0
when the @entity110 ; e watch hits stores in 2015 , the @entity78 app will allow guests to unlock their hotel room doors without having to fumble with a key or dig through a bag to find a key card			1
the app was featured during @entity2 ’s unveiling earlier this year and it will be used at some of @entity78 ’s properties , which include the @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity126 brands , starting next spring			1
apps that unlock hotel room doors are the wave of the future as hotel and travel companies attempt to make holidays more convenient			2
@entity135 has also announced plans to replace keys with smartphones			2
@entity139 is partnering with the tech giant to create an @entity142 app that will allow travellers to manage their bookings			0
@entity78 recently made headlines when it announced that it would be using a robot butler at its aloft boutique hotel in @entity148 ’s @entity29			1
known as the @entity150 , the robotic bellhop is designed to ferry amenities from the front desk to any of the hotel ’s 150 rooms in just three minutes or less			2
it comes after the system hit several glitches following its launch last week			2
some @entity9 users in the @entity160 have been double - charged for purchases			0
the @entity148 tech giant has admitted there is a problem with its mobile payment system , but says it only affected ' a very small number ' of @entity9 users with @entity168 , and is working to refund all faulty transactions			2
@entity85 and @entity86 initially accepted @entity9 , but quickly turned heel and no longer take the payment system			2
the chains disabled the system in their stores over the weekend , reports the @entity175			2
the retailer group to which both companies belong , the @entity178 ( @entity179 ) , is creating @entity180 -- a system similar to @entity9 that will be owned by a consortium of retailers rather than a third party , i.e. @entity2			1
@entity9 ( screenshots pictured above ) stores @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 credit card information and works with the @entity1 6 's @entity4 fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods			1
stores such as @entity196 , @entity197 's and @entity198 involved the @entity178 , a consortium of retailers creating their own mobile payment app , includes dozens of companies , many of which are among @entity160 's largest retailers : @entity204 , @entity205 's , @entity206 , @entity103 's , @entity104 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 's , @entity219 and more			2
like @entity9 , @entity220 allows consumers to quickly and securely pay for goods and services with the aid of an app on their cell phones			0
@entity220 , however , appears to work in an opposite way from @entity9			0
while the former uses what 's called an @entity83 chip , which is scanned by the retail kiosk , the @entity179 system has the phone scan a code generated by the kiosk			1
not only is @entity220 hoping to leave @entity2 out in the cold , it 's trying to circumvent credit cards completely			1
while @entity9 allows users to store whatever credit cards they 'd like in their phones , @entity220 taps directly into the user 's bank account			0
results , though , are the same : a seamless and safe purchasing process			0
@entity220 is set to hit smartphones in 2015			0
@entity2 said it had found most retailers were enthusiastic			1
' the feedback we are getting from customers and retailers about @entity9 is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic , it told @entity251			0
' we are working to get as many merchants as possible to support this convenient , secure and private payment option for consumers			0
' many retailers have already seen the benefits and are delighting their customers at over 220,000 locations			0
and that may be @entity2 's one advantage , it 's pay system is already here			1
@entity9 made its debut last week			0
now you can flash your new @entity1 in the checkout line to pay for food , clothing and other goods			1
there 's no need to pull out your credit card			0
but do n't leave your wallet or purse behind quite yet : despite a few dozen retail chains pledging support for @entity9 , so - called contactless payments are still new			0
smaller merchants , in particular , are n't likely to have the necessary equipment right away			0
all told , there are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept @entity9 in the @entity160 @entity2 has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting @entity9 at launch , and others are planning to do so by the end of the year			1
@entity2 said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores , if not all of them , were ready at monday 's launch : @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 's , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 retail stores including @entity297 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity301 , @entity301 , @entity197 , @entity196 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , run by @entity301 , six : 02 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity293 , unleashed by @entity306 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313			1
bright side : dozens of retailers will be accepting @entity9 , the biggest of which include @entity310 , @entity317 , @entity311 , @entity196 and @entity197 's @entity2 also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year : @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 and @entity325			1
for online payments , @entity2 said the following merchants have apps ready for @entity9 : @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity305 , @entity336 , @entity323 , @entity102 and @entity337			1
others expected by year 's end include : @entity339 , @entity299 , @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 by @entity343 , @entity322 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347			0
of course , @entity2 's retail stores and the @entity350 app will also take @entity9			1
@entity9 is designed to protect the user 's personal information			0
it does n't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user , the merchant and the user 's bank			0
@entity2 does n't collect its users ' purchase history , so when they are shopping in a store or restaurant it does n't know what they bought , where they bought it or how much they paid for it			1
card numbers are not stored on the device , instead , a unique @entity365 is created , encrypted and stored in the @entity368 of the device			0
the mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity4 button			1
the @entity83 chip is fitted across the top of the phone			1
the @entity365 in the @entity368 is walled off from @entity377 and not backed up to @entity378			0
users can make purchases in stores and within apps , with credit cards issued by many @entity160 banks , which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the country			0
the mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity4 button			1
the @entity83 chip is fitted across the top of the phone			1
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			0
it uses the @entity396 app and cards that are already on file with @entity399 can be saved to it			0
users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account			0
this is verified by the card 's bank before being accepted			0
if an @entity1 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity1 service			2
this wo n't cancel the cards , either , because the card details themselves are not stored on that device			0
@entity2 said it is ' working hard ' on bringing it to the @entity416 , although a date has yet to be announced			2

@entity83 technology in @entity1 *handset* could be used to replace travel and @entity4 cards
system already set to be used by @entity78 to allow entry to rooms without a key
comes as @entity2 in row with retailers over pay system
