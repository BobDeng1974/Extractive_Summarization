more revelations from @entity2 's explosive autobiography tells how he has had numerous bust - ups with colleagues over the years says he broke a rib in a fight with @entity11 team - mate @entity10 was accused of injuring his club mate @entity12 on purpose smacked @entity15 in the face after the striker threw scissors at him but left the room with his arm round him 10 minutes later dragged @entity22 along the ground during a dispute in part two of extracts of @entity2 's explosive autobiography i am @entity2 , the striker tells of fist fights with team - mates and trying to evade the law in fast cars			1
i joined @entity11 in 2010 and our biggest league match was approaching			1
the @entity11 derby against @entity37 , whose most passionate fans — the @entity40 — were going to hate me			1
on top of that , i had issues with @entity10 , a guy in my team			1
he was an @entity45 the size of a house , and i told a mate in the squad : ‘ something serious is gon na happen			1
’ @entity10 resembled a heavyweight boxer			1
he was nearly 6ft 5in and weighed over 15 stone , but he could n’t handle me			2
he accused me of trash talking , but that was n’t true			1
i ’ve heard so much s * * t over the years : ‘ f * * * * * * gypsy ’ , stuff about my mum — all that stuff			1
i retaliate with my body , not with words			2
@entity65 passion : but sometimes @entity2 gets too wound up and fights with his team - mates rage : @entity2 documents his disputes with a number of team - mates built like a heavyweight boxer : but @entity2 still had a fight with @entity74 team - mate @entity10 i told @entity10 i did not trash talk , but he just kept on			1
he shushed me with his finger			2
then he did it again			2
i did n’t say anything , not a word			2
that b * * * * * * was going to find out how i trash - talk ! the next time he got the ball in training , i rushed towards him and jumped up with my feet and studs out in front — the worst type of tackle			1
but he saw me and leapt out of the way			2
as we both crashed to the ground , my first thought was : ‘ s * * t ! i ’ve missed ! ’ as i got up and walked away i felt a blow to my shoulder			1
not a good idea , @entity10			1
i headbutted him , and we flew at each other			2
we wanted to tear each other limb from limb			2
we were rolling around , punching and kneeing each other			2
we were crazy and furious — it was like life and death			2
afterwards , the weirdest thing happened			2
@entity10 started praying to @entity107 with tears in his eyes , making the sign of the cross			1
this felt like a provocation , and i got more furious			2
i was stopped by my team - mates , and i suppose that was a good thing			1
it could have turned out nasty			0
all the time , i was thinking : ‘ s * * * , my chest hurts , ’ so we had it checked out			0
i ’d broken a rib in the fight			1
it was not the first time i ’d had a dispute with a team - mate			1
threat : @entity2 ( right ) vowed he would break the legs of @entity12 ( centre ) during one outburst scissor kick : @entity15 threw some scissors at @entity2 during a row - but the pair walked out of the room minutes later as good friends ! it 's not just his own team - mates he gets involved with : the striker gets involved in a scrap between @entity37 and @entity141 in 2007 seeing red : @entity144 's star striker is sent off against @entity141 earlier this year in 2004 , i was playing for @entity145 against @entity146 , whose team included many of my @entity150 club colleagues			1
it was a friendly but the entire @entity145 squad was out for revenge for our loss in the @entity157 tournament			0
we wanted to prove we could beat @entity146			0
early on in the match i got a ball outside the penalty area and immediately had four @entity161 on me			0
one of them was my team - mate , @entity12 , who went on to play for @entity164			1
i powered my way through the challenges , and @entity12 was left lying in pain on the pitch			1
he was taken off on a stretcher with a torn ankle ligament			0
nothing serious , but he might miss a match or two			0
he claimed in the papers that i ’d injured him on purpose			1
what kind of * * * * was that ? there was n’t even a free - kick awarded ! that guy was supposed to be my team captain ! i phoned @entity12 : ‘ listen up , i ’m sorry , it ’s a shame about your injury , but it was n’t intentional			1
you got that ? ’ he did n’t back down even a millimetre			0
when we returned to @entity150 , the atmosphere became more and more heated			0
finally , @entity190 , the coach , called us into a meeting			0
by that time i was completely obsessed			0
we all sat in a circle in our lunch room , and i immediately sensed the seriousness of the situation			1
you could feel it in the air			0
‘ @entity2 did it on purpose , ’ said @entity12 , and i saw red			1
‘ i did n’t injure you on purpose , and you know that			1
if you accuse me again i ’ll break both your legs , and that time it will be on purpose , ’ i said			1
feud : former team - mates @entity2 ( right ) and @entity208 had a run in during a game ' @entity211 ' : @entity22 tried to provoke @entity2 with a tackle from behind , says the striker grappling : @entity2 and @entity22 have had plenty more on - field battles since while at @entity150 , my friend @entity15 , who went on to play in the @entity216 , declared publicly that he wanted to be transferred			1
he was n’t exactly a diplomat ; he was worse than me			0
after one match , when he ’d been on the bench against @entity219 , he came into the locker room and called us all miserable c * * * *			1
i responded by saying if anybody was a c * * * it was him			0
@entity15 picked up a pair of scissors and flung them at me			1
the scissors whizzed past my head , straight into the concrete wall and made a crack in it			2
i went over and gave him a smack , but 10 minutes later we left with our arms around each other			1
much later i discovered our team manager had kept those scissors as a souvenir , to show his @entity244 was n’t all about fighting with team - mates			1
i remember facing @entity208 , a centre back who is now the vice-captain of @entity248			0
we had played at @entity249 and he tried to provoke me with a cowardly tackle from behind			0
i went down in a lot of pain but did n’t say anything			0
i took my revenge after the final whistle , grabbing his head and dragging him along like a disobedient dog			0
i could see @entity22 was scared			1
‘ you wanted to fight			2
so how come you ’re s * * * * * * g yourself now , ’ i hissed before heading off to the changing room			2
on the receiving end : @entity2 takes an elbow in the face from @entity263 and ( below ) one from @entity264 @entity2 fights for the ball with @entity264 i love cars , but sometimes i drive like a maniac			1
me and a friend took a new @entity269 out on the roads in @entity145			0
i stepped on the gas and got it up to 155mph			0
when i slowed down , we heard police @entity275 could n’t just stop , apologise and hand over my licence			0
the police boxed in about four cars behind us			0
i had @entity280 number plates , which they could n’t trace , so i floored it and hit 190mph			0
the ' wee , wee ' of the sirens became fainter and fainter			0
it was like a film as we nipped into an underpass and waited until the police had disappeared			0
another time , we were n’t so lucky			0
i drove with a friend along the street where all the prostitutes in @entity293 wait for punters			0
we saw a woman leaning over a car , talking to a client , and decided to have some fun			0
i slammed on the brakes and rushed over yelling : ‘ police			0
put your hands up ! ’ the old man was totally scared and tore out of there			0
minutes later , he turned up in a police car			2
‘ it was a joke , ’ i explained			0
the cops laughed , but a photographer appeared and snapped a photo			0
idiot that i was , i put on a huge grin			0
you can imagine what happened next			0
you 've read about the madness - now enjoy some of @entity2 's genius propelled to greatness : @entity2 scores his wonder goal against @entity318 above everyone : @entity2 celebrates the goal by removing his shirt and jumping for joy rocket : @entity2 scores his ha - trick goal , a free - kick from 35 yards video : watch @entity2 's superb free - kick against @entity318 ... and that propeller kick flying through the air : a conventional bicycle kick against @entity331 in @entity332 video : @entity2 's backheel volleyed goal against @entity248 in @entity157 and a very similar one for @entity37 against @entity335 running man : @entity2 celebrates scoring in the @entity337 against @entity338 on cloud 9 : @entity2 , taking the ball on his chest for @entity342 , celebrates winning the @entity344 title last season with @entity346 ( right )			1
