@entity0 posted a picture of himself with his trousers down on his @entity4 account on thursday			1
with one message coming out of the player ’s camp and a very different one emerging from the @entity9 it ’s difficult to know who feels they have been left exposed by who			0
we take a look at the contract wrangle and ask : could he really end up at @entity17 ? @entity0 , out of contract at the end of the campaign , is pictured training for @entity22 on friday his contract runs out on june 30 why has it come to this ? @entity22 had never planned to keep @entity0 beyond this season			1
he ’s served them brilliantly but he will be 32 next month and on £ 85,000 - a - week he is one of their top earning defenders along with @entity30			2
what they were not counting on is their own incompetence in finding a replacement for him and the @entity37 transfer ban that stops them buying anyone this summer			0
so now they want him to stay ? they do , but very much on their terms			0
the club are letting it be known they have offered him a two - year deal with an option of a third year depending on the number of games played in the second year			1
@entity0 ’ camp say it ’s actually a one - year deal to be renewed for a second year , and then a third year , only if he plays a certain number of matches			1
the new contract also comes with incentives			0
if he wins things then he will end up earning the same money but his basic earnings before bonuses would drop			0
@entity22 defender @entity0 has been sounded out by @entity17 over a move to @entity61 and there are other clubs who will gladly take him ? after weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the @entity9 to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three - year deal with none of the strings , sub-clauses and trap - doors as the @entity22 deal			1
and that club is @entity17 ? @entity17 are the prime suspects with @entity78 out of the running			1
but @entity0 ' camp say now is not the time to name the club			2
you sound doubtful … only in as much as if @entity17 had really offered him a three - year deal would he still be haggling with @entity22 ? surely a @entity85 swansong at @entity61 is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the @entity90 giants – winning four leagues , three cups and two @entity94 titles			1
perhaps he just really wants to stay in @entity22 ? the children he has with ex-wife @entity96 ( who is now his agent ) live in the city and after 13 years in @entity90 he is reluctant to leave			2
he is hoping @entity22 , desperate because they ca n't sign players , make him a better offer			2
dinorah @entity96 , @entity0 ex-wife and now his agent , addressed the media earlier this week but if he does end up at @entity17 will he be a success ? it ’s easy to look at the gold shoes , the denim waistcoats and the polka dot ties and just see an eccentric extrovert who plays football in his part - time			1
that does a tremendous injustice to easily the most gifted and successful right - back of his generation			0
he remains super-fit and if there is slightly less energy to get up and down the pitch as there once was perhaps that would n’t be a bad thing – @entity125 is hardly going to want him flying forward @entity22 style at every possibility			0
he remains very watchable and has a tenacity and speed of recovery that means he never has been the defensive liability some have depicted			0
the @entity132 international is hopeful @entity22 make him an improved offer so he can stay at the @entity9 you make it sound as though @entity22 would be foolish to let him leave ... in view of the fact that if they allow him to walk away they will end up having to play @entity141 at right back then that may well be the case			1
the strange summer signing from @entity143 who cost £ 4m and has started one game looks completely out of his depth			0
put it this way – the manager @entity150 wants @entity0 to stay .			0
