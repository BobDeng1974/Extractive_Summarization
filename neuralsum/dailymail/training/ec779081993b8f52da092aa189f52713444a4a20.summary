there can be little mistake who we ’re talking about			2
‘ when he played in my team he was always on the brink of clashing with players , ’ says @entity4 , the youth team coach at @entity5 , @entity6 ’s leading club			1
‘ that ’s just the intensity with which he plays			1
he did n’t care about anything other than scoring and winning			2
many times i had to calm him down			2
’ @entity16 , another coach at @entity5 , agrees			2
‘ i hope these words are n’t misunderstood but he has always been something of a rough diamond when playing football , ’ he says			2
‘ the word we use is “ bandit ”			2
he would try anything to win a match , taking the rules to the limit and even beyond			2
’ star in the making : former junior team - mates of @entity31 say he has always been committed on the pitch @entity33 pupil : @entity31 poses with a teacher and some of his paintings it could only be @entity31 , the man who , assuming he recovers from knee surgery , is most likely to be @entity40 ’s nemesis when @entity42 ’s team take on @entity6 in @entity43 on june 19			1
for while @entity31 has established his reputation in @entity40 as one of the world ’s best footballers , he is also the man who bit @entity49 — the second such incident in his career — and the man who was found guilty of racially abusing @entity53			1
and then there is the diving and arguing with referees , though in comparison to his worst misdemeanours , those seem relatively minor			2
the talent , the temper and tantrums : they all seem inseparable cords of the personality that makes up @entity31			1
and all were evident early on			2
though , incredibly , for a player now ranked by some only behind @entity71 and @entity72 as the world ’s greatest , at the age of 15 he was in danger of being dropped by @entity5			2
‘ there was no certainty he would be a professional player , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ when he was younger , he did n’t play too much			2
his team - mates , like @entity77 and @entity78 , kept him out of the first team and at the time i could n’t see him becoming what he is now			1
’ making his point : the striker scored 31 times for @entity87 as they finished second in the @entity88 prize guy : @entity31 was the @entity90 @entity31 moved to @entity91 from @entity92 aged seven , although the transition to the capital was troubled , according to those close to him , because of the split between his parents , @entity98 and @entity99 , when he was nine years old			1
‘ he was a kid , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ naturally he was carrying some family problems due to his parents ’ split			2
sometimes he would miss training			0
that ’s why in his beginning he did n’t take football that seriously			0
’ the scout who had taken him to @entity5 , @entity106 , remembers that pivotal period of @entity31 ’s life			1
‘ there was a time i said to him , “ if you do n’t take football seriously i can release you from @entity5 just as easily as i brought you here ”			1
it bothered me that he was not playing , so i persuaded him to try harder to be part of the regular youth teams			0
‘ he understood that and [ from then on ] he has never stopped trying			0
he is a kind of monster , with a huge heart , in the way he plays			0
after so many years in football , i have seen loads of players with better skills but without his hunger for success and glory			0
’ perhaps @entity31 owes a little of his success to @entity106 ’s daughter , who , however innocently , would provide updates on his social life			1
‘ he would go to the same parties as my daughter and she would say , “ i saw @entity31 last night ”			1
‘ i would say , “ oh , did you ? ” because “ @entity31 ” had to play the next day			1
it was not the best thing for him to do , but the day after he was there , ready to score more goals , with the same intensity as usual			1
only when they get to 16 or 17 years old do players realise they have to focus on their careers and they start to stay at home more			0
one of my jobs was convincing him to follow the right path to be a professional			0
’ darker days : @entity31 was slapped with a 10 - game ban for biting @entity49 last year illegal intervention : @entity31 infamously handballed on the line during the quarter - final victory over @entity157 at the 2010 @entity158 sharpshooter : @entity31 has scored 38 times for his country once the work ethic had been installed , curbing his aggression was the next task			1
in a highly disputed incident , when he was 16 , he was alleged to have head - butted a referee after being sent off in a crucial match for the @entity5 under - 17 team in a title decider against @entity170			1
what is established is that @entity31 was outraged by the red card , approached the referee @entity173 , and that something unsavoury took place			1
but no contemporary report now exists and no one who was there appears willing to discuss it in full			0
@entity4 said : ‘ the incident was not as big as people have made out			0
there was a discussion among the players , the referee was involved in the scene and received some aggression from @entity31 — but unintentionally			1
i do n’t know whether it was a punch or a spit but it was n’t that important			0
’ @entity77 said : ‘ i was next to him when he had that incident with the referee			0
it is as if he lives the matches too much , his entire life goes on the pitch and he knows when he is wrong			0
that time we were in the dressing room and he knew he had gone too far			1
’ @entity106 added : ‘ he received a ban and that was it			0
he ’s never been a violent player			0
’ almost all agree that meeting @entity201 , who is now his wife , at the age of 15 was the catalyst for @entity31 ’s talent to be fulfilled			1
‘ for footballers , getting married too early is a common mistake , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ but @entity31 ’s case was very special			1
when he was in my team i remember seeing @entity209 watching matches			1
i ’m very happy they are still together			0
’ @entity31 credits @entity209 with helping him to fulfil his potential			1
‘ i was n’t on the path i wanted to be on , ’ he said			0
‘ i was going out at night , i did n’t enjoy studying and i was n’t dedicating myself to football			0
when i was a kid , there were some people around me who were a bad influence			0
support : @entity31 credits his wife @entity209 with keeping him on the path to success concern : @entity31 underwent knee surgery last month and is a doubt for their opener against @entity226 @entity31 's career has been plagued by disciplinary issues			1
in july 2010 he was sent off for a last - gasp goalline hand - ball which stopped @entity157 from scoring the winner in a @entity158 quarter - final			1
@entity232 missed @entity157 ’s penalty and @entity6 won the shootout			0
in november that year , playing for @entity235 , he was given a seven - match ban for biting @entity238 ’s @entity237			1
having joined @entity87 he was banned for eight matches and fined £ 40,000 for racially abusing @entity240 defender @entity53 in october 2011			1
he refused to shake @entity53 ’s hand when the teams next met and in april last year was banned for 10 games for biting the arm of @entity245 defender @entity49			0
‘ when i met my @entity209 , i think it all changed			0
she was very important for me because she steered me back on to the path i wanted to be on			0
‘ when i was single i would go out at night , but then when i had a girlfriend i would always go to her house , so i had more peace of mind			0
she would also tell me to study and to focus on my ability to play football , and to forget about everything else			0
‘ i ’m the one out on the pitch , but i think if she had n’t helped me change my life , i probably would n’t have made it			0
also , i was n’t playing at @entity5 , i was on the bench , some people told me to look for another club , but there were two people who told me to stay and helped me to get another chance			0
’ now the whole of @entity6 waits , expecting him to be fit , if not for their first match of the @entity158 against @entity226 , then certainly to face his adopted country @entity40			1
‘ he is definitely on the way to being one of the most important players in @entity6 history and there ’s still more to come , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ with @entity31 , @entity274 and @entity275 , @entity6 have as a good a team as i can ever remember			1
’ @entity106 is especially confident			0
‘ defenders in @entity40 do n’t know how to mark him as he is so unpredictable , ’ he said			1
‘ he watches the game and always changes his tactics depending on the defender he has to face			0
it will be difficult for @entity6 to have a striker of his magnitude ever again			2
’ for all his troubles and the initial lack of application to the game , the early influences on @entity31 ’s life are proud of what he has achieved			1
‘ it has been very emotional watching him develop , ’ said @entity4			0
@entity40 can but hope he can be contained , just for a day .			1
