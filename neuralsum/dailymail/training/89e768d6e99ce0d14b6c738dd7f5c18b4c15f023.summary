by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 07:19 est , 23 april 2013 @entity2 grandmother @entity1 faces an agonising wait of up to 18 weeks before she learns whether a new appeal against her death sentence has been successful			1
the day after @entity2 's @entity7 ruled the @entity2 government was not obliged to pay for an ' adequate lawyer ' for her in @entity11 , a local solicitor has agreed to continue fighting for her without charge - for now			1
@entity12 said today that he had lodged a last - ditch appeal to @entity15 's highest authority , the @entity16			1
he added that he hoped that friends and supporters would be able to find the £ 8,000 she needs to cover his fees			0
running out of options : @entity1 sits in her cell knitting while on death row in @entity25 , @entity11			0
her lawyer has lodged a last - ditch appeal against her death sentence to @entity15 's @entity16 @entity1 , 56 , from @entity29 - who was condemned to death for carrying £ 1.6million worth of cocaine into @entity11 last year - has already lost one appeal to a lower court and her options are now running out			1
with a second appeal now formally lodged by mr @entity12 , he has 14 days to submit to the @entity16 the actual grounds of her appeal against death			0
@entity1 will then have to wait for up to 18 weeks before the @entity16 judges announce whether she has been successful			0
should she lose again , her lawyer can ask force a judicial review and should that fail only a plea for mercy to the president would be able to save the grandmother from the firing squad			1
the @entity49 has refused to pay for @entity1 's fight through the @entity15 courts as a matter of policy			1
officials say that paying her fees would open the floodgates for all other @entity2 in trouble with the law overseas			1
@entity60 , sitting with two other judges at the @entity7 yesterday , said the court had given ' very careful consideration ' to the issues raised in what he described as a ' troubling ' case			1
he said the reasons for the judgment would be given ' as soon as possible '			0
the @entity69 of the @entity70 : yesterday three judges at the @entity7 said ruled that the @entity2 government was not obliged to pay for an ' adequate lawyer ' for @entity1 in @entity11 @entity60 , when announcing the decision to dismiss the appeal , said it was ' obviously a terribly serious matter '			1
he said it was ' most unfortunate ' that the sum required to secure the representation sought by the appellant - roughly £ 6,000 - was ' relatively speaking ' a ' very small sum indeed '			0
the judge added : ' but that can not affect the principle that we have had to consider and it can not affect our decision			0
' but it may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days			0
' mr @entity12 has agreed to fight on without payment but admits he hopes @entity1 's friends can come up with the further £ 6,000 to add to the £ 2,000 they have managed to club together			2
' i lodged an official notification to appeal to the @entity16 through the district court @entity95 ( @entity11 's capital ) ' , he said today			2
the lack of money , he said , ' will not change my position to defend @entity1 because i do n't defend her only for the money			0
' @entity1 during her trial last october : in an open letter before the @entity2 court handed down its ruling , mrs @entity1 said she hoped lessons would be learned if she was eventually put to death he hit out at the @entity2 government 's decision not to fund his client 's case			1
' i ca n't comprehend it , ' he said			0
' even @entity15 tries to defend its citizens when they are facing serious problems overseas			2
' mr @entity12 said the @entity16 would consider the second appeal in a closed hearing and announce its decision at a later stage , which could be up to four months			0
in an open letter before the @entity2 court handed down its ruling , @entity1 said she hoped lessons would be learned if she was eventually put to death			2
' if i should die - and i hope i do n't , but i fear i may - then i hope that my execution will prompt the @entity2 government to do more for others , ' she said .			2

@entity2 's @entity7 has ruled the @entity2 does n't have to pay her legal fees
local solicitor has agreed to fight her case for free until cash can be raised
if the appeal fails only a mercy plea to @entity15 's president can save her
