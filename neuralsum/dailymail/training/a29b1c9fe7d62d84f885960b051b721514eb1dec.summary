beauty : @entity9 in the @entity25 programme @entity26			2
singer @entity13 was ahead of the curve when she saw the talent in the actress more importantly perhaps , the @entity31 - born beauty – who was then a struggling student – actually got paid for her work			1

the taunts she suffered left miss @entity13 severely depressed and on the verge of quitting her successful pop career to disappear into the background			1
