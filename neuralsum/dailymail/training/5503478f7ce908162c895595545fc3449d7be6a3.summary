by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:53 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:34 est , 19 december 2013 a @entity4 company has created the ultimate boy toy every aspiring @entity6 will want for @entity7 - a wrist - mounted underwater jet pack			1
the current prototype , called the ‘ x2 underwater @entity10 ’ , is a unique arm - worn delivery system that generates powerful vectored thrust , amplifying movements of the user ’s arms			1
the creators say it gives scuba and free - divers a new way to explore freestyle underwater acrobatics as well as simply fly around underwater			2
' the weightless environment underwater provides amazing potential for acrobatic stunts and freedom of movement , ' said @entity46 , co-inventor and co-founder of @entity49			0
to power the x2 underwater @entity10 the developers integrated the latest lithium battery technology and coupled it with @entity52 digital motors and a wireless control system thrust : the inventors say the @entity24 ' redefines underwater propulsion ' he added : ' the optimum position when using other technology is to hold it out directly in front of you , but this often means that the thrust is directed straight at the user			1
the @entity24 uses two propellers strapped to the outside of the user 's wrist			1
it is powered by a lithium battery and controlled wirelessly			0
the inventors say it is superior to other underwater propulsion systems because the thrust does n't go straight into the users body			2
' the x2 underwater @entity10 is worn on the outer arms and is fast , manoeuvrable , un-tethered , and frankly redefines underwater propulsion			0
' the company 's website also features the conceptual ' fitting x2 @entity79 ' , which boasts a fully - enclosed body suit that makes the user look like a science fiction super-soldier			0
@entity35 claims powered marine action sports is a dynamic new growth market and is trying to raise capital through @entity86 , a crowdfunding company			0
@entity35 is trying to fund bringing the @entity24 to market through crowdsourcing if you fancy one for @entity7 , you 'll be disappointed to know it does n't come out until next year @entity35 claims powered marine action sports is a dynamic new growth market			2

the @entity24 underwater jet pack turns user into human *torpedo*
it is currently a prototype but will go on sale next year
it uses lithium batteries and *cutting* - edge propulsion technology
