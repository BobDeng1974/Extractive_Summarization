@entity1 ’s agent has cast fresh doubt on the striker ’s @entity4 future by insisting he should play every week			1
@entity1 was left out of the @entity4 squad by @entity7 for the @entity9 defeat at home by @entity11 on sunday and @entity12 revealed on monday that the 28 - year - old loanee has serious doubts about whether he will be offered a permanent contract at the end of the season			1
now @entity1 ’s representative @entity18 has suggested the @entity20 star , who has started just eight games under @entity22 , would play regularly for any other team and admitted he may leave @entity4 in the summer			1
@entity35 leads the league on 70.33 £ 40,000 - @entity1 ’s daily wages £ 1.77m - cost of each of his @entity4 goals in wages , not including bonuses ( @entity42 of @entity44 ’s 18 goals has cost @entity45 £ 210,000 in wages ) @entity18 — who hardly ever speaks publicly — said : ‘ i do n’t know ( if he will stay )			1
he is a fantastic player and i think it ’s very difficult for @entity4 fans — they have an absolutely brilliant player , one of the very best in the world , who would without any doubt play 90 minutes , every time , with any other club			2
‘ the truth is , now , we do n’t know what will happen			0
what we do know is that he will play for one of the very best clubs in the world next season , whether that is @entity4 or not			0
i am 100 per cent sure of that			0
but you know how football works — we ’ll see what happens			0
’ @entity4 have a close relationship with @entity18			1
he brought them @entity70 10 years ago and currently represents stars such as goalkeeper @entity72			0
understandably , the @entity28 hierarchy would like to maintain that relationship but at the moment the benefits of paying £ 43million to keep @entity1 beyond this season do not look obvious			2
@entity1 , pictured against @entity77 in the @entity78 , has only scored three goals since his move to @entity4 the former @entity82 striker has scored only three goals for @entity4 and @entity18 has revealed there is already interest from @entity86 , particularly @entity87			1
@entity1 is likely to be back in @entity22 ’s team this saturday when @entity4 face @entity89 in @entity90			2
fellow striker @entity91 is struggling with an ankle injury and @entity1 is the natural replacement			2
another @entity4 forward who is finding it difficult to get a look - in under @entity22 is @entity97 — and the @entity98 is expecting to be loaned out later this transfer window			0
last season he was courted by top clubs across @entity101 and , indeed , the @entity103 national team , after breaking through under previous boss @entity104 .			0

@entity1 was left out of the @entity4 squad on sunday
@entity18 has admitted @entity1 may leave @entity28 in the summer
he also revealed there is already interest in the striker from @entity87
