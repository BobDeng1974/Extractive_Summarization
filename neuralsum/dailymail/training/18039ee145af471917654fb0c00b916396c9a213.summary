by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 05:54 est , 18 may 2013 every major investment bank ’s trading floor has a number of different ‘ tribes ’			0
there are the barrow - boy bond traders and the nerdy research analysts , the upper - crust equity salesmen and the derivatives ‘ rocket scientists ’			2
but at the four banks i worked at during my 12 - year @entity15 career , there tended to be one breed louder , flasher and brasher than the rest — the commodity traders			1
and the most important commodity of all is oil , which is why the global oil - dealing market is worth £ 1.65 trillion			2
invariably male , this elevated breed — they can each earn up to £ 1 million a year , plus bonuses — like to think of themselves as the kings of the banking jungle			1
and they have social lives to match			0
kings of the jungle : hard - partying oil traders like to see themselves as an elevated breed among @entity15 types ( picture posed by models ) in my time , most thursdays would see them heading out in a pack for a traditional night of ‘ extra-curricular ’ activities in the @entity45 , with each blowing as much cash in an evening as most people earn in a month			1
cocktails and champagne at the @entity50 at @entity51 might be followed by a rowdy meal at the @entity54 - starred @entity53 , and then a visit to one of their favoured ‘ exotic - dancing ’ establishments — be it @entity61 ’s or @entity60			0
the volume of alcohol consumed would make @entity64 look sober			0
no matter how late these alpha males stayed out , they would all make sure to come in especially early the next day — as a sign of their macho resilience			0
on many friday afternoons , we would hear their snores coming from the cubicles of our trading floor ’s loos			0
thus far , these hard - partying oil traders have been exempt from the big banking scandals that have rocked the @entity15 since 2008			1
they did not create toxic mortgage products , indulge in insider trading or manipulate the @entity79 inter-bank lending rates to make borrowing more expensive			0
however , that may be about to change			0
this week , competition investigators from the @entity82 raided the offices of @entity84 , @entity85 , and the @entity88 oil and gas company @entity86 , as well as those of the oil price reporting agency @entity90			1
suspicion : if accusations of price - fixing by companies including @entity85 are true , @entity94 motorists have been paying inflated petrol prices for years they were trying to find out whether individuals from these companies had colluded to fix the ‘ reported ’ price of certain oil benchmarks			1
the authorities want to know whether traders artificially pushed up the price of oil , thus making bigger profits for their employers , but also making life more expensive for the motorist			1
certainly , when you examine the system that records the price of oil — the @entity90 price reporting system — it does seem vulnerable to abuse			1
this system records only a fraction of the oil trades that are made on any given day , and the companies that trade oil can choose to submit only a portion of their trades if they so desire			2
a certain amount of trade verification does take place on the trades submitted to @entity90 , and some that appear too high or low are rejected			2
nonetheless , an unethical oil trader could send @entity90 — typically via an instant messenger text system or by telephone — details only of trades that suggested a higher price than was generally being achieved			1
or they could simply supply false information			0
if traders did this in collusion with others so that several reported artificially high prices , then the official price recorded by @entity90 could be moved a few cents higher			1
here ’s how they might do it : if a trader at a major oil firm bought a million barrels of oil at , say , $ 100 a barrel , there appears to be little stopping him reporting to @entity90 that he actually bought the oil for $ 100.10 a barrel			1
then , if he ’s colluded with enough of his trading competitors to deliver similarly inflated prices , @entity90 will , in good faith , report that oil is being bought and sold at a higher price than the one it is really being traded for			1
of course , the increase in the @entity90 benchmark figure will be less than 10 cents a barrel because most traders report accurate data , and an average figure is arrived at			1
still , the increase , even if it is only a few cents , could lead to massive profits if the trades are big enough			0
despite these shortcomings , the @entity90 price is widely recognised as the best available method for reaching an average price in an otherwise opaque oil market , and so is used as a benchmark for oil deals worth billions of dollars			1
and it is not just the price of oil — and thus the price of petrol at the pumps — which such manipulation would affect			2
it could also affect the price of @entity188 gas , which in turn dictates how much we pay for gas in this country , which also happens to be a major influence on the cost of electricity			0
there are reports that the @entity82 competition authorities are concerned that any possible price - fixing may have been going on for a decade			1
if so , then the impact on the average family ’s finances will have been dramatic			0
if oil speculators have pushed up the prices we pay for petrol , gas and electricity by just 1 per cent for the whole of the past decade , then the @entity94 people might have been conned out of more than £ 5.5 billion			0
in fact , the impact would have been much higher because the cost of oil has a direct effect on the prices of so many other products ( including paint , petrochemicals and so on ) — and , of course , the price of nearly everything we buy has to include transport costs — which increase as oil becomes more expensive			2
rip off : oil speculators may have conned the @entity94 people out of £ 5.5billion over the past decade so far , no investment banks or hedge funds — some of whose traders also buy and sell oil — have been raided , but common sense tells us that if this investigation is based on any truth , then such developments can not be far away			2
indeed , as yesterday ’s @entity237 revealed , there are other methods that could be used to manipulate the price of oil			2
the @entity241 has published a report claiming that speculators are using an age - old trick to make a fast buck at the expense of @entity94 ’s 33 million motorists			0
traders working for major commodity - dealing firms are said to have been buying up vast amounts of oil with a view to making a large profit when they sell it			1
they do this by refusing to release the fuel onto the market and , in so doing , force a squeeze in supply			0
that inevitably pushes the prices up			0
the problem with @entity15 traders is that they generally exhibit three main character traits — intelligence , greed and ruthlessness			1
combine these with the fact that they work in a short - term , hire - and - fire world , and it is easy to see why they might break rules to enhance their bonuses			0
all @entity15 traders assess risk and reward on a daily basis			1
since the rewards for market manipulation can be massive and , until recently , the risk of being caught has been minimal , some traders would regard breaking the rules as almost a logical business strategy			0
i ’m afraid that given the choice between artificially raising a pensioner ’s gas bill and adding £ 100,000 to your bonus , it would be heresy in the @entity15 to even mention the former concern			2
this investigation into price - fixing is at an early stage and the companies being investigated say that they are co-operating with the commission , but there are three reasons why i think this may turn into a major scandal			2
first , the system is too open to abuse for a group of clever participants not to have realised its vulnerability			2
second , personal experience informs me the ethics of many commodity traders are not what they might be			0
and , third , my @entity15 contacts tell me there have been rumours of strange pricing data for some time			1
if price - fixing has occurred , then it will prove once again that @entity94 is not the incorruptible country we like to think it is , and that tougher regulation is needed to cleanse our system of this widespread abuse			1
more than 200 years ago , the economist @entity321 wrote in @entity322 that ‘ people of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices ’			0
sadly , that may be as true today as ever it was .			0

oil traders see themselves as an ' elevated breed ' among @entity15 workers
oil price reporting system - @entity90 - is ' vulnerable to abuse '
