venture capitalist @entity0 , boss of @entity2 - based developers behind the app said : ' if you 're a law enforcement guy , you might have concerns ' police and anti-terrorist agencies are facing a formidable new enemy – a cheap smartphone app that encrypts texts and phone calls , making them virtually impossible to bug			1
@entity14 , which costs £ 2 a month , allows users to apply a secret code to their messages and calls which gives them military - level security			1
the system also makes it impossible for intelligence agencies to analyse which numbers terror suspects and criminals are calling , or when – a technique that is a mainstay of criminal investigation			1
a senior @entity29 official who has worked extensively in counter-terrorism and against organised crime said he feared that @entity33 would ‘ enable the bad guys to get ahead ’			1
encrypted emails have been used by terrorists for years , he said , and sometimes proved impossible to crack			1
‘ we ’re in a constant race against them and i suppose this is another issue we ’re going to have to deal with , ’ he said			2
@entity40 , the @entity2 - based investment fund behind the app , says it ‘ will work with law enforcement agencies to ensure this product does not fall into the wrong hands ’			1
but because the firm that will actually run the app is registered in the @entity47 , neither @entity29 nor other @entity49 security agencies will have any legal right to obtain warrants to gain ‘ real - time ’ access to unencrypted calls			1
former head of @entity56 sir @entity55 said the app is ' at the top of the security ladder ' @entity14 is extraordinarily easy to use			1
subscribers are given a special , secret number prefixed by the code +281 , and can then call or text anyone else with a @entity14 account			0
the app uses the internet to transmit the call , using either a wi - fi connection or an ordinary mobile phone signal			1
calls to far - flung parts of the world are therefore free			1
seecrypt functions by generating a one - time cipher composed of two ‘ layers ’ of 2,048 digits every time subscribers contact each other			1
sources say it would take a super-computer at @entity82 – @entity29 ’s communications intelligence agency – about six months to break a code with just one layer of encryption at this level			0
@entity14 allows users to make and receive secure voice calls and text messages			2
anti-terrorist agencies say this is an obstacle they will have to overcome sir @entity55 , a former head of the @entity56 , is one of @entity33 ’s advisers			2
he said the app met the encryption standard required for official communications classified as ‘ @entity98 ’ , and is ‘ at the top of the security ladder ’			2
@entity14 is the direct descendant of @entity102 , @entity40 ’s military - grade app , which has been certified as virtually bug - proof by @entity82			1
@entity102 is widely deployed by @entity105 forces in @entity106 as well as law enforcement and intelligence organisations around the world			0
@entity40 ’s chief executive is @entity0 , the businessman who first exposed the bizarre relationship between former defence secretary @entity112 and his bogus ‘ special adviser ’ , @entity113			0
it was when the three men met in @entity2 in 2011 to discuss the progress of @entity102 that mr @entity113 gave mr @entity0 a business card that falsely suggested he had a formal @entity119 position			1
in fact , although mr @entity113 had been best man at dr @entity112 ’s wedding and travelled the world at his side , with his bills paid by a network of political donors , he had neither security clearance nor any official post			0
the ensuing scandal forced dr @entity112 to resign			0
he is currently suing mr @entity130 for libel over comments he made in a television interview			0
mr @entity0 said @entity33 expected to have a million subscribers within its first three months , and already had the capacity to go to 25 million			0
he maintained it was aimed at ‘ anyone who wanted to restore their privacy ’ , adding that the @entity141 had estimated that industrial espionage conducted against private business by @entity144 alone was costing the @entity141 economy about £ 750 billion a year			0
a senior @entity29 counter-terrorist official said that terrorists have been using encrypted emails for years , some which are impossible to crack mr @entity0 admitted : ‘ if you ’re a law enforcement guy , you might have concerns			2
for them , it ’s not going to be entirely helpful			0
’ but he continued : ‘ people ’s privacy has been invaded more and more during the past decade			0
this will enable you to get some of it back			2
’ also working on @entity14 ’s development is @entity161 , the former chief technology officer of the @entity162 – the body responsible for every aspect of the president ’s security			0
he said : ‘ your mobile phone is the open window on your privacy			0
of course @entity33 could be exploited by villains , but we will do everything we can to stop it being misused			0

app makes phones nearly impossible to bug by encrypting texts and calls
@entity181 app is said to ' enable the bad guys to get ahead ' by anti-terrorist agent
@entity2 - based investment fund backed the cheap and easy - to - use app
