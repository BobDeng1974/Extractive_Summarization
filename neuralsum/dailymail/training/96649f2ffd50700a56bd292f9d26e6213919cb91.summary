by @entity0 this is the world 's oldest surviving @entity3 's restaurant - which still retains a classic 1950s feel , as well as the fast food chain 's original mascot ' @entity7 '			1
built in 1953 , the restaurant in @entity10 , @entity11 still has its original red - striped exterior , giving it an appearance quite different from the other 30,000 @entity3 's restaurants around the world			1
the unique , time - capsule appearance of the restaurant is completed by the 1950s - style uniforms the staff wear , and the original recipe hamburgers , cheeseburgers , fries and milkshakes			1
while serving original 1950s cuisine - which customers order from a retro - designed menu - staff at the outlet wear the fast food chain 's historic uniforms , including paper hats			1
as well as old - fashioned food , the restaurant also serves current favourites such as @entity61 and @entity62 - but only because it nearly closed in the 1990s due to declining sales			0
@entity3 's had planned to demolish it and build a ' retro ' one nearby but instead restored the current architecture following pressure from preservationists			1
the restaurant has been located in @entity10 - 12 miles from @entity70 - for the past 61 years			2
despite its history , many locals had no idea the restaurant was the oldest of its kind in existence			0
@entity79 , 40 , from @entity80 , @entity81 , made a 560 - mile round trip to @entity10 just to eat at the restaurant			2
traditional : the mascot ' @entity7 ' was based on a chef who embodied the fast service diners could expect and he still features on the @entity10 restaurant 's drinks different times : @entity49 looks over the building 's so - called ' @entity90 ' architecture - a popular movement between the 1940s and mid- 1960s inspired by the @entity96 's growing obsession with cars and space travel unique : even the two ' golden arches ' either side of the restaurant 's front service window are also a relic because they are of a kind only installed at the world 's first three @entity105 's ' it 's my favourite @entity3 's by far			1
that 's why i made the effort to come here , ' he said			0
' there 's something special about it , the architecture and the feel			0
it 's more like a 1950s burger shack than a modern fast food place , ' she added			0
her husband , @entity120 , 45 agreed , adding : ' you can almost imagine waitresses on roller skates bringing the meals			0
' ' i love @entity3 's but most of them you visit could be anywhere ... this is so distinctive , from the look of it , and you 'd never believe it was a @entity3 's if it was n't for the @entity135 , ' he said			1
when built , the restaurant was only the third ever @entity3 's to open and operated outside of the main franchise for decades			1
the first ever @entity3 's opened in @entity139 , @entity11 in 1938 , selling hamburgers for just ten cents each			1
but as it was run independently from the main company , the site in @entity10 kept its distinctive 1950s feel , while other @entity3 's restaurants worldwide were given a more uniform look			1
record : the restaurant has been located in @entity10 - 12 miles from @entity70 - for the past 61 years			2
despite its history , many locals had no idea the restaurant was the oldest of its kind in existence branching out : as well as old - fashioned food , the restaurant also serves current favourites such as @entity61 and @entity62 - but only because it nearly closed in the 1990s due to declining sales rescue : @entity3 's had planned to demolish the restaurant and build a brand new branch with a ' retro ' design nearby			1
instead they opted to restore the current architecture following pressure from preservationists the mascot ' @entity7 ' was based on a chef who embodied the fast service diners could expect and he still features on the @entity10 restaurant 's drinks			2
the fast food chain replaced the character with the now far better known @entity3 in 1967			0
@entity49 looks over the building 's so - called ' @entity174 - a popular movement between the 1940s and mid- 1960s that was inspired by the @entity96 's growing obsession with cars and space travel			0
even the two ' golden arches ' either side of the restaurant 's front service window are also a relic because they are of a kind only installed at the world 's first three @entity105			0
visitors come from all over the world purely to experience the unique @entity3 's restaurant			1
among them is @entity191 , a 38 - year - old building developer from @entity192			0
' i love @entity3 's and i 'd read about this location on the internet and just had to visit - it was a sort of pilgrimage for me , ' he said			1
' i 've eaten at @entity105 all over the world but this one is so unique ... i do n't know whether it 's the retro style but the food tastes even better than it normally does , ' he added			0
brothers @entity202 opened the first @entity3 's restaurant in @entity139 , @entity11 in 1940			1
eight years after it was set up , the company introduced a ' @entity205 ' , which helped kick - start the fast food craze by pre-cooking food ahead of a customer order			0
to help sell the idea , @entity3 's created the mascot ' @entity7 ' - designed as a chef to reassure customers of the food 's quality			2
@entity3 ( centre ) replaced @entity49 as the company 's official mascot in 1967			2
he inhabits a fantasy world of characters , including the monster @entity221 ( top left ) and @entity222 ( bottom left ) the first restaurants were run as franchises , allowing each to operate independently while benefiting from being part of a bigger brand			0
it was n't until 1955 that @entity230 - @entity96 businessman @entity229 opened the ninth @entity3 's restaurant in @entity231 , @entity232			1
the success of his business encouraged @entity229 to partner with the @entity3 brothers and relaunch the business as a global chain			0
aggressive expansion followed , with the @entity3 brothers regularly arguing with @entity229 over how the business should be run			2
by 1961 the brothers finally grew tired of @entity229 's global ambitions for the company , selling their shares to him for $ 2.7million and retiring from the fast food business altogether			0
in 1967 @entity49 was replaced as company mascot by @entity3 - a clown who inhabits the ' @entity221 ' fantasy world			0
the origin of @entity3 is disputed , with actor @entity251 claiming @entity3 's adopted a character he had invented , while the company insists @entity251 merely played the role in early television appearances .			2

restaurant in @entity10 , @entity11 was only the third @entity3 's ever built
the branch opened in 1953 , looking almost exactly as it still does today
it was run independently from main business , so retained original design
staff still wear 1950s uniforms while serving original recipe burgers
