@entity9 , from @entity75 , @entity2 , said : ‘ we tried to distract the lions by thundering on the cages to try and scare them and we got brooms and brushes to try and get them off her			1
’ ‘ it was the lioness we were worried about because they are the killers			0
‘ the male was hand reared by the student coordinator so all he had to say was no and he would back off , but because there was blood you ca n't really expect them to differentiate between meat you are providing to them and not			0
’ after two frantic minutes the lions released their grip on the 18 - year - old who was bleeding heavily having sustained severe wounds to her legs and thighs			1
back home : @entity9 with parents @entity100 and @entity102 along with one with cat kitty as the first medically qualified volunteer on the scene , @entity9 sprung into action using skills she learned in the veterinary practice applying pressure to the wound and preventing the girl from going into shock before a paramedic arrived on the scene			2

’ her mother , @entity102 , praised her daughter 's quick actions			0
she said : ‘ @entity9 is a qualified veterinary nurse so is quite capable of doing first aid and keeping calm so she would have been a very good person to have in that situation			1
‘ it would have been very difficult for her to see because she loves the wildlife and animals and to see one attack a volunteer must have been very difficult for her			0
‘ from what she 's told me it seems as if she was a bit of a heroine to get in there and try and get this lion off that was attacking a volunteer - i think she did brilliantly			0
