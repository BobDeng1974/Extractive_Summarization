it ’s one of the world ’s most bizarre and best kept secrets of @entity3			1
in the world ’s largest @entity6 majority country , thousands of @entity3 pilgrims travel to the @entity8 , otherwise known as ‘ @entity9 ’ in @entity10 , to have sex with strangers as part of a religious ritual dateline video journalist , @entity15 , whose story is set to show on @entity17 , got to uncover the incredible life on top of the mountain , given unusual access to what goes on			1
mr @entity15 says every 35 days you have to perform sex seven consecutive times for the ritual to work			1
‘ it ’s a pretty bizarre story			0
a few years ago i read a piece about it and looked into it , it took a while to get there , ’ he said			0
and what he found he described as ‘ incredibly surprising ’			0
‘ it was hard to make sense of it , after being there it took a few weeks to digest			0
’ dateline video journalist , @entity15 ( pictured ) covered the bizzare story of the @entity9 and found it interesting and awkward the ancient ritual dates back to the 16th century and is a regular meeting of ritual believers participating in sexual acts , with the view that it brings good luck and fortune			1
from married men , housewives , government officials and prostitutes , there ’s a variety of people who participate			1
and for a country and religion where sex out of wedlock is taboo , mr @entity15 says the idea of a mountain top sex ritual for @entity6 in @entity3 seems very strange			1
‘ back in the 16th century , a young @entity3 prince had an affair with his step mother , ’ he said			2
‘ they ran away to the mountain and had sex and mid coitus they were caught , killed and buried			2
‘ there is a shrine there now and because they did n’t get to finish the act , others believe that if you do , fortune will come to you , most people like poor farmers who want to get ahead in life			2
’ he says he saw no @entity97 there but people come from all over @entity3 to see if their luck would change			1
‘ it ’s a @entity103 ritual which is very different to the @entity6 world , very different to everywhere else in @entity3 , the beliefs are a blend of @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , ’ he said			1
so popular the ritual has now turned into a tourist attraction for locals with the government charging people to go there , with stalls and even buskers			1
‘ it ’s a bit of a carnival			0
’ ‘ it ’s contradictory , the government knows adultery is happening yet they ’re preaching something different and turning a blind eye , ’ he said			2
while mr @entity15 , who was fascinated by the ritual , said the only problem is that there is more men than women and in turn it has become prime territory for commercial sex workers			1
he even got propositioned himself by a sex worker whilst filming but said he quickly declined the offer			0
he said seeing inside doings of the religious ritual , it seems very controversial			1
back in the days people used to have sex out in the open but now there are a number of huts that people can sex in behind closed doors ' i think there 's a growing contradiction with @entity9 , there 's the prostitution , so how it is possible this is all being condoned by the government and religious leaders , ' he said			1
' the one thing is the problem of sexually transmitted diseases , there 's health clinics set up at mountain			0
' ' i talked to a doctor and he said most sex workers have sexual diseases and men do n’t use condoms , so @entity163 is on the up			2
' the @entity166 video journalist was lucky enough to follow some pilgrims to the mountain and talked to them about their experiences			2
' it took a lot of convincing , as it is adulterous , i followed them , some came by boat or motorbike , from right across @entity3 and i had access to friends and people before they got there			2
' so popular the ritual has now turned into tourist attraction for locals with the government charging people to get , with stalls buskers mr @entity15 followed a female pilgrim called @entity187 who was a widow and for two years had struggled financially			1
living in a small @entity103 town , she had just completed her mission of having sex seven times when he was there			0
' she said business become better and made more money , it 's maybe proof it does work , ' he said			0
' i met a male pilgrim called @entity200 , and his friends but he did n't want to kiss and tell			0
' ' one of his friends said they went for fun and karaoke , another said he does go for the sex ritual but did n't want to say too much because he did n't want his wife to find out , but felt his life would turn around			1
' he also described another pilgrim he met that also did n't want to talk too much about it in fear of his wife finding out			0
' it 's incredibly hard to get women talking , obviously cheating on their husband			0
' while he found the incredibly bizarre sex ritual confronting and rather ' awkward ' to film and talk about , he said there was nothing unsafe or dangerous about it			1
' quite beautiful prayers , they give beautiful offerings of flowers , at the grave of shrine people get teary and pray for hours on end			0
' ' @entity227 felt in any threat , it was a nice environment			0
' he did however feel what needed to be mentioned is that the religion was not specific of @entity106			0
' it 's not something to demonise the religion , ' he said , ' it 's not strictly @entity106 as we know it			0
' ' you 'll never find any ritual like this in any part of the @entity6 world and @entity3 , @entity103 interpretation is much more liberal			1
' mr @entity15 's story airs on dateline monday night at 9.30pm on @entity17 .			2
