by @entity1 reporter a fox in a field of newborn lambs would be enough to worry any ewe			1
but apparently not this one , who was pictured standing calmly beside the intruder as it watched lambs in the @entity10			1
in one shot a young lamb just a few weeks old is in the foreground in full view of the fox			0
best buddies : it looks almost as if the mother sheep is gunning for the fox , but she did nothing of the sort , and let the predator be adult mother sheep can be protective of their young and shepherds have told of seeing them lower their heads to butt a fox or usher it away from their new born			2
but in this instance the adult sheep are totally unconcerned by the proximity of the fox and , to be fair , the fox does n’t seem much bothered either			2
the pictures were taken by @entity36 , 69 , at a field near the village of @entity39 , near @entity40 , in the @entity10 recently			1
mr @entity36 had been walking his labrador dog along a lane next to the field when he spotted the fox			0
he said : ‘ it was a very strange sight			0
i saw the fox in the field and the sheep and lambs were not taking a blind bit of notice of it			1
just the three of us : the ewe , the fox and the newborn lamb all appeared to be happily ' grazing ' on the field having a field day : the new friends were pictured near the village of @entity39 , near @entity40 , in the @entity10 ‘ i have lived in the countryside for a long time and never seen anything like it			1
' if there is a dog about the sheep normally go mad so i could n’t understand why they would just be ignoring a natural predator like a fox , particularly as there were very young lambs in the field			1
‘ i watched the fox for a good five minutes hiding behind a gate so it could n’t see me and managed to take some pictures			0
‘ the fox eventually ran off when two ladies came along the lane and i think it either saw them or picked up a scent			0
’ mr @entity36 said the fox appeared to be eating grass , like the sheep , although foxes eat a lot of worms as well so it may have been foraging			0
the fox and sheep appeared to take no notice of each other as they moved across the field			2

a fox was pictured among the lambs *-* and the ewe did nothing
