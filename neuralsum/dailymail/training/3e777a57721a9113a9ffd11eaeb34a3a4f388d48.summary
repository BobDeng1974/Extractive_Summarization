by @entity0 a leading respiratory expert has warned that the @entity2 is sitting on a lung disease ‘ time bomb ’			2
professor @entity5 , a consultant in respiratory medicine at @entity7 , said idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( @entity8 ) , which is responsible for 5,000 deaths annually , is increasing at a rate of 5,000 new cases a year			1
the condition , one of a group of disorders known collectively as interstitial lung disease , causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue			1
professor @entity5 says the @entity2 is sitting on a lung disease time bomb ( file picture ) it leaves sufferers with a life expectancy of three to five years			1
it is estimated that @entity8 affects around 15,000 people over 60 in the @entity2 , mainly men and former smokers , but can affect anyone and its cause is unknown			0
the disease often goes undiagnosed until the onset of symptoms - such as shortness of breath and coughing			0
as a result , intervention with the only available treatment , the anti-fibrotic drug @entity39 , can only slow down progression of the disease			0
professor @entity5 said : ‘ nationally , the number of people suffering from @entity8 and other interstitial lung diseases is increasing by thousands every year , but the cause is often unknown			1
‘ as a result , the majority of patients are diagnosed late when their life expectancy has been cut extremely short			2
’ more than a quarter – 28 per cent - of patients being treated at @entity7 's respiratory centre have some form of interstitial lung disease , with four to six new cases presenting every week			1
professor @entity5 said the numbers demonstrated there was an ‘ urgent need ’ to develop a quick and simple way of diagnosing early @entity8			2
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - the lung condition that professor @entity5 is concerned about - is most common in men and former smokers but it can affect anyone as a result , he has relaunched a study he began in @entity68 to discover if electronic stethoscopes - usually used to listen to the heart - can detect early signs of the disease			1
he said : ‘ in particular at a time when treatments to slow disease progression are becoming available , we urgently need to develop a quick , cheap and simple tool to increase the number of patients treated early in their disease course			0
‘ we believe using electronic stethoscopes to identify distinctive sounds , which we already know are similar to ripped @entity82 , could alert clinicians to people who might be developing the early stages of the disease			0
‘ they could then be sent for chest high - resolution ct scan to confirm the diagnosis , ideally before they become symptomatic , and give us the opportunity to start an appropriate close monitoring programme and intervene before the condition has taken hold			0

professor @entity5 says idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is killing 5,000 people a year and that there are currently 5,000 new cases per year
the condition is one of a group known as interstitial lung disease
it causes inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue
sufferers have a life expectancy of just three to five years
