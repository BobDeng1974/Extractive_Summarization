fifty @entity0 has got nothing on the sexual awakening of one @entity4 mother who has self - published her own ' erotic true - life memoir ' on @entity7			1
@entity8 , a married mother - of - two from @entity9 , @entity10 , has written @entity11 in @entity12 , in which she relates how she went from being a bored housewife to having outrageous sexual encounters with a string of lovers including a team of firefighters and a distinguished @entity20 diplomat			1
@entity8 explains how her ' sexual journey ' began when she was 29 - years - old and she and her husband , @entity22 , took an eye - opening trip to @entity12			1
erotic journey : @entity8 went from being a bored housewife to having a ' decadent ' sex life with multiple lovers she writes : ' until that night i was living a relatively normal existence as a married woman with two young children in a small commuter town in @entity34			1
i was a 29 - year - old stay at home mum , whose husband @entity22 worked long and intense hours in the music industry , which meant he was n’t around as much as other fathers and do his share of child care , however , the financial rewards were worth it			0
' the couple started out attending sex shows and venues famed for swinging but were initially ' both reticent , and unsure as how each other would react if either had any intimate contact with anyone else			0
' but she recalls how an encounter with a @entity20 couple , @entity53 and @entity54 , at a club that ' appealled to the higher echelons of the @entity12 swinging culture ' caused them to relax their ' rules of engagement '			2
experimental : @entity8 said her encounters with other men enhanced her sex life with her husband ( posed by models ) @entity8 relates how she had an intimate sexual encounter with @entity53 in an alcove of the club after they left their respective partners to buy drinks			1
she said of the liaison : ' i was in complete ecstasy , not having had this level of close up personal attention from another man in seven years of marriage			0
' ' i was in complete ecstasy , not having had this level of close up personal attention from another man in seven years of marriage ' when they returned to their partners and @entity54 asked ' if she could take @entity22 and show him around her " favourite areas " of the club ' she said ' who was i to argue ! ' while some people may be horrified at the thought of their husband or wife with another person , @entity8 said it enhanced their marriage			2
she said : ' our personal sex life had become very intense , and experimental , with @entity22 , who during our lovemaking was very much into having me tell him in detail about my liaison with @entity53 , and what else i wished i 'd done with him , and would do if the opportunity arose in the future			2
this very much excited him			0
' liberated : the mother went on to have numerous sexual encounters juggling family life with exploring her fantasies ( posed by models ) real erotica : @entity8 said her book is all true from then on , the couple become much more adventurous with @entity8 learning how to ' juggle her family life in @entity10 with her decadent sexual life in @entity20 and beyond			1
' she said : ' all the liaisons took place with my husband , or flying solo , as a fully liberated woman ( with his full approval ) , who knows what she wants and lets nothing stop her from turning her fantasies into reality … however unattainable they may seem			1
' @entity8 told @entity125 her book differs from the many other erotic novels currently storming the bestseller lists because it 's all true - and she is n't hiding behind a pseudonym			2
she said : ' where my book is different is that it is a true - life memoir of my sexual journey emanating from a weekend break to @entity12 back in 1991 and my subsequent story			1
' the book is not a novella written by a faceless person usually using a ridiculous pen name such as @entity137 , @entity138 etc with equally unbelievable central characters with names such as @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
i have never met people with such names in the real world			0
' she added : ' i do n't in any way class my book as pornography but pure and simple factual erotica written for today 's modern woman by a woman who is real and has lived it			0
' i hope it inspires women from wherever and whatever age you are , to embrace your sexuality , and explore fully the deep dark erotic side that we all have ( some hidden deeper than others )			0
