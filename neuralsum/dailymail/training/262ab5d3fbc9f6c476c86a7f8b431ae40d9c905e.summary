president @entity0 has again refused to call the battle with terrorism in the @entity3 a war against radical @entity5			0
in his latest interview , the commander - in - chief agrees certain factions have perverted the religion having embraced a ' nihilistic , violent , almost medieval interpretation of @entity5 ' but he insists that such labels hurt efforts to root out radical ideologies in @entity15 communities which have been tainted by groups such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
' they are doing damage in a lot of countries around the world			0
' but i reject a notion that somehow creates a religious war because the overwhelming majority of @entity15 reject that interpretation of @entity5			1
they do n't even recognize it as being @entity5			0
' i think for us to be successful in fighting this scurge it 's very important to align ourselves with the 99.9 per cent of @entity15			1
' in january , during a visit from @entity48 prime minister @entity47 , @entity0 also refused to call @entity17 terrorists @entity15			1
following the speech is spokesman released a statement saying : ' let â€™s call them what they are			0
these terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion			2
reasoning : speaking to @entity26 ' s @entity25 , he said : ' there is an element growing out of @entity15 communities in certain parts of the world that have perverted the religion '			1
but he rejected the notion it was driven entirely by religion ' but based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions , those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with @entity5 , ' he said			2
the @entity76 president said he does not consider the threat from @entity17 an ' existential ' one			2
earlier this month senator @entity78 told @entity79 : ' we are in a religious war with radical @entity5			0
when i hear the @entity84 and his chief spokesperson failing to admit that we 're in a religious war , it really bothers me on tuesday , during a speech in @entity89 , @entity0 told an audience the country could succeed if it was n't divided by religious lines .			0

speaking to @entity26 he agreed some factions had ' perverted ' the religion
but he said ' overwhelming majority ' of @entity15 ignore interpretations
in the fight he insisted the @entity76 *needed* to align itself with the 99.9 *%*
it 's his *administration* 's *policy* not to refer to them in religious terms
