by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:11 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 19:12 est , 14 march 2014 hundreds of thousands of savers who have built up small pension pots are to receive a major boost from @entity7 in next week ’s budget			1
the chancellor will relax rules to enable retirees with modest nest eggs to take them as cash lump sums , the @entity9 has learned			1
the move would help those who are currently forced to turn small savings into a regular income known as an annuity when they stop work			1
savers : those with less than £ 15,000 in their pension pots will be able to convert the amount into cash mr @entity7 ’s reforms are expected to benefit up to 150,000 savers a year who have built up pension pots of less than £ 15,000 , usually having been in a job for only a few years			1
many get a poor deal when they are forced to use it to buy an annuity – a form of insurance – even if it only pays out a few pounds a week			2
change : it is understood the rules will be introduced by the chancellor @entity7 they also have little choice when they try to shop around for a better deal , since many insurers will not accept savings so small			0
the chancellor ’s budget reform , to allow people to convert such pension pots into cash , is a victory for the @entity9 ’s ‘ stop the @entity56 rip - off ’ campaign which called for the change			1
the move is also a response to repeated @entity60 attacks on the £ 12billion - a - year annuity industry , which has been criticised for a lack of clarity on charges to consumers			1
under existing rules , only those approaching retirement with less than £ 18,000 in total pension savings can avoid buying an annuity and take their fund as cash instead			2
but many workers have had several employers , and built up pension savings from each job – which when added together take them over the threshold			0
a third of the 335,000 annuity sales last year were for sums of less than £ 10,000 , though they are usually unable to secure similar value to those who have saved more			1
a recent analysis by @entity85 regulator the @entity82 found that individuals with pension pots in the range of £ 50,000 to £ 100,000 could buy pensions worth as much as 50 pence per pound more than those with a pot of £ 5,000 or less			1
a 65 - year - old with a nest egg of £ 5,000 , for example , would receive a retirement income of just £ 5 per week			1
the @entity82 has expressed concern that small pensions savers are being placed at risk by the requirement to use their savings to buy an annuity			2
floored : many savers who were only in a job for a few years get a poor deal on their pension those who have small sums dotted around among previous employers will also pay duplicate charges if they have to buy an annuity			2
the chancellor ’s measure will allow ordinary workers to access small pension pots directly and make their own choices about how they invest it or spend it , rather than handing control over to annuity salespeople			0
@entity119 , a pensions expert at financial services firm @entity121 , said : ‘ it is very hard for investors with such small pots to get good value from their pension fund			2
’ the @entity127 , which represents the country ’s leading pension providers , has also said it supports reform			0
other key expected moves in next week ’s statement include an attempt to underline @entity135 claims to be the true ‘ workers ’ party ’ with another increase in the personal tax allowance , cutting tax bills for millions by at least £ 100 a year , and further cuts to the welfare budget			1
the chancellor is also poised to extend emergency tax breaks offered to small and medium - sized businesses that were introduced by the @entity146 during the recession as a means of kick - starting @entity150 ’s ailing economy			0
commentary by @entity151 , @entity152 turning a pension into an income for life using an annuity can seem desperately poor value at the best of times			0
but for anyone with a pot of less than £ 15,000 the returns can be rotten			1
a 65 - year - old with £ 10,000 of savings would get an income of just £ 7.50 a week			1
and pound for pound these small savers are worse off than those who convert bigger pensions into an annuity			2
of the 353,000 pensions turned in to an income last year , 100,700 were by people who had savings of less than £ 10,000			1
they should n’t have to			0
many retiring workers today have had several employers , and been left with scraps of pensions from all these different jobs			1
in some cases they ’ve got two from the same company , after a final salary scheme was shut down and replaced with one linked to the stock market			0
anyone with a pot this small ought to be allowed to have their money back as cash			0
a lump sum could help them pay off a debt , make home improvements , or bolster their other savings – an annuity of £ 7 a week is going to make little or no difference to their lifestyle			1
it just lines the pockets of insurers a little bit more			0
the reason so many take an annuity they do n’t want is because they are hampered by antiquated pension rules			0
now , the chancellor looks set to offer them help			2
this government has been accused of fiddling too much with pensions – but this is the kind of tinkering that is necessary and welcomed			2
a particular problem has been the changing face of @entity150 ’s workforce and the retirement schemes employees are offered			0
many retiring workers today have had several employers , and been left with scraps of pensions from all these different jobs			1
in some cases they ’ve got two from the same company , after a final salary scheme was shut down and replaced with one linked to the stock market			0
it is these final salary benefits that typically push savers over a limit which prevents them from taking their smaller pots of cash			0
allowing those with slightly bigger pots to discount their final salary benefits and cash in their small savings in defined contribution schemes is a practical step which will help 150,000 people			0
this rule change is likely to cost the @entity246 nothing – it will still pull in the same amount of tax – but could be a valuable lifeline for hundreds of thousands of those who just want to get a better deal for their life savings .			0

pensions worth less than £ 15,000 will be able to be drawn as lump sums
many are finding themselves with scraps of pensions from different firms
