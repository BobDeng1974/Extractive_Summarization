holidaymakers are being urged not to panic after leading ski resorts across the @entity2 and the @entity3 delayed their openings by at least a week due to a lack of snow			1
upmarket resorts such as @entity8 and @entity9 had planned to open on december 6 , but are now pushing that back to december 13			1
it comes after unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in november to melt			1
a live webcam at the @entity8 resort in @entity16 shows virtually no snow on the slopes today in some areas , slopes have been left almost entirely bare			2
however , travel experts said that the delays in opening would not affect @entity25 holidaymakers as the ski seasons for the majority of @entity25 tour operators do n’t start until late december			1
instead , it is typically only locals who use the slopes in the first two weeks of opening			0
@entity33 , a spokesman @entity35 publicity that represents a number of leading ski resorts , told the @entity39 : ‘ most tour operators do n’t sell holidays that begin before december 20			0
@entity9 's webcam also showed bare slopes today , although experts insist snow is due in the coming days snow - making machines have been placed on the slopes of @entity49 mountain in western @entity50 snow - making machines stand on a snowless slope on @entity53 in western @entity50 last week ‘ it ’s only locals who use the slopes in the first couple of weeks , but they do n’t buy ski holidays – they just turn up , so they wo n’t be out of pocket			1
‘ the resorts obviously do n’t want weekend skiers using up the snow if there has been very little falling on the slopes , so by delaying the opening of the resorts they are preventing that from happening			0
‘ widespread snowfall is expected in the coming days , in some cases there will be up to 80 percent cover			1
‘ if the worst does happen , resorts like @entity8 have invested in cutting edge snow machines which are capable of covering slopes in inches of artificial snow from bare grass in a matter of hours			2
' despite their efficiency , the machines are estimated to cost up to £ 5 per cubic metre of manmade snow			0
‘ they have invested around £ 3million in @entity85 machines which can fill an @entity87 - sized swimming pool in just thirty minutes , ’ said ms @entity33			0
@entity16 remains the most popular ski destination for @entity25 skiers , and 400,000 tourists from the @entity25 chose @entity50 as their ski destination last year			2
news of the delayed opening comes after the @entity95 resort in @entity16 revealed it has postponed its opening indefinitely , along with others in the region			0
‘ we opened on the weekend of nov 22			0
then the rain and thaw damaged the snow at the bottom of the slopes , ’ said a spokeswoman for @entity95 , near @entity100			0
@entity8 is one of @entity16 's most popular ski resorts and is usually covered in thick snow at this time of year according to the national weather service , there is very little snow below 2,000m for this time of year - and in some cases none at all - but snowfall is forecast for the end of the week			1
and in the eastern @entity118 range , the @entity116 resort has also decided to open later for the same reasons			0
snow - making machines have already been placed on the slopes of @entity49 mountain in the western @entity50 village of @entity124 in a bid to try and attract holidaymakers			2
@entity9 in the @entity127 has also been struggling with the unseasonably warm weather this year similar problems have affected other @entity50 resorts , including @entity131 in @entity132 and @entity134 mountain in @entity135 , at a time when the snow is usually plentiful			1
tourism bosses have blamed the lack of snow on unusually warm winter weather			1
but temperatures in the @entity2 were recently revealed to be rising faster than anywhere else in the world , with @entity2 resorts attempting to adapt to climate change			0
a recent @entity50 climate report found the country ’s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880 , with the number of sunshine hours in the @entity127 increasing by 20 per cent .			2

@entity8 and @entity9 set to open on dec 13th , a week later than planned
unusually warm temperatures caused early snowfall in november to melt
travel experts say @entity25 holidaymakers unlikely to be affected by delay
more snow forecast across the @entity127 in the coming days
