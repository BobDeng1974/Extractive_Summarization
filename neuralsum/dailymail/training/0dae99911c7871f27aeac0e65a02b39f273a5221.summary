a headmaster has revealed the ' semi-literate ' job applications he received from state school teachers vying for a post at his top boarding school			1
among the spelling mistake - ridden cvs received by @entity9 were boasts that one history teacher liked ' to see a student bossom ' ( sic ) , while a chemistry teacher gave his date of birth as 1053			1
mr @entity9 , the headmaster at leading private school @entity15 , was so appalled at the poor standards displayed by candidates for the post of assistant headteacher that he has made details of their applications public			1
standards : @entity15 headmaster @entity9 said that of the 30 job applications he received from state school teachers for a job at his school , 12 were ' semi-literate ' among the 50 cvs and covering letters mr @entity9 received , 30 were from state school teachers			1
just one state school teacher was among the final eight candidates , and he did not get the job			2
mr @entity9 told @entity32 : ' of the 30 from state schools , 12 were semi-literate			1
these are serving teachers and this is really worrying			0
' the headmaster said the spelling errors , coupled with the low standard of academic qualifications achieved by many of the applicants , showed the failings of many teachers working in state schools			2
he questioned how such candidates with low a-level grades and third - class university degrees could impart basic education to children and called for the introduction of minimum standards which potential staff must meet before they are allowed to teach			2
candidates : among the applicants for the assistant headteacher position at the @entity58 school , pictured , was a teacher who said he liked ' to see a student bossom ' mr @entity9 also said that many teachers between 25 and 40 who had themselves been taught in state schools had never been taught basic grammar , spelling , and sentence structure			1
among the cvs received was one from a chemistry teacher , who used the word ' form ' instead of ' from ' when describing how long he had been a teacher , wrote that he had been born in 1053 and included two pages documenting his experience of flying a single - engine aircraft			1
he also wrote about being a keen sailor three times in his application			0
others had poor qualifications , including @entity80 , @entity81 , and e grades at @entity83 , with one hoping to land the post despite having achieved just five o - levels and a typing certificate			0
one candidate wrote his application in block capitals , while a woman teacher said her skills involved ' diversity and cultural competence '			0
a history teacher wrote that he ' liked to see a student bossom ' , while other letters addressed mr @entity9 as ' mr @entity9 ' , or simply ' @entity98 '			1
mr @entity9 said that he would like to see a minimum standard introduced in which teachers had achieved at least three b grades at @entity83 , and a 2:1 degree in their chosen teaching subject			1
last week a new international study revealed that @entity106 pupils lag behind leading nations including @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and the @entity113 city of @entity114			0
the study was carried out as part of the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) , and focused on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge			0
the findings show that the @entity106 's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499 , roughly average for all countries and on a par with the @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
results : although students from @entity15 regularly celebrate getting top a-level grades ( pictured last year ) , some of the teachers applying for a job at the school had not done so well in their exams @entity106 did better in science with an above - average 514 points , similar to @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			2
official figures have shown that one - in - five of state secondary school maths teachers in @entity143 do not have a maths degree , with the same being true of 34 per cent of physics teachers			0
a spokesman for the @entity147 said that a record number of high - achieving graduates are now applying to become teachers			0
' we are reforming teacher training to attract the best graduates and professionals , investing £ 4m in professionals , investing £ 4m in professional development for existing teachers and reforming pay so schools can attract the best teacher who have the greatest impact on their pupil 's achievements , ' he said			2
