the average @entity0 believes they will only consume 3,000 calories on christmas day			1
but in reality , most of us will eat and drink our way through 7,000 calories in just one sitting and then spend most of january trying to burn it off			1
according to new research , most people have no idea that they will triple their recommended daily calorie allowance ( 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men ) on the most indulgent day of the year			2
the average @entity15 believes they only consume 3,000 calories on christmas day , but really they eat 7,000			1
a roast potato is 200 calories , @entity19 pudding is 330 and pigs in blankets are 97 apiece in a new survey , more than a third of people said they would only consume 3,000 calories , with just two per cent correctly estimating 7,000 - 29 per cent thought they would eat less than 3,000 calories			1
roast potatoes , at 200 calories each , were named the favourite part of the festive dinner , followed by turkey at 303 calories for three slices , then sausages wrapped in bacon at 97 calories each			1
@entity39 , at 133 calories a glass , was the top tipple to accompany the @entity19 meal , which contains 1,450 calories , followed by mulled wine at 119 per glass , then @entity45 at 180			1
then there 's the extra chocolate , mince pies , nuts , crisps and biscuits that leave most of us feeling as rotund as @entity54 himself by the time we go to bed			2
it would take more than 10 hours of running , cycling at more than 20mph for seven hours , climbing stairs for eight hours and skipping for 12 hours to burn off the 7,000 calories consumed on @entity61 it would take more than 10 hours of running , cycling at more than 20mph for seven hours , climbing stairs for eight hours and skipping for 12 hours to burn off the 7,000 calories consumed on christmas day			1
the survey into the nation 's eating , drinking and exercise habits was carried out for @entity70			2
head trainer @entity71 said : ' it does show how little people are aware of the calorie content of the food they eat			1
' we over-eat at the best of times but @entity61 is off the scale			1
people seem to resign themselves to putting weight on over the holidays and worry about their weight in the @entity84			2
' i 'd say if you do n't want to gain weight , then maybe fill up on vegetables , drink water in between alcoholic drinks , go for a walk before and after your dinner and try not to have too many treats			2
' @entity19 , of course , but many people go from being healthy to completely binging on food and drink and it leaves them feeling sluggish and bad about themselves			0
' losing weight was the top @entity99 with 28 per cent of people saying it was their aim for 2015 @entity103 , an eating disorder specialist , agrees and says she speaks to many people , women in particular , whose self - esteem takes a nose - dive after the holidays			0
she said : ' people feel they have permission to have a blowout because it 's @entity19			0
a lot of this is done in a dissociated state and the pounds pile on without us even noticing			0
' in our western culture , weight gain is inextricably linked to failure and getting it wrong			0
' people feel self - loathing and self - criticism following their @entity19 binge and wake up in the @entity84 berating themselves and planning the next diet			0
' then they often go to the other extreme with strict diets , new regimes and unrealistic goads that are ultimately unsustainable			0
' @entity39 ( 175ml ) - 133 red wine ( 175ml ) - 126 white wine ( 175ml ) - 133 @entity45 ( 50ml ) - 180 @entity132 ( 50ml ) - 150 @entity133 ( 50ml ) - 122 mulled wine ( 175ml ) - 119 lager ( pint ) - 170 bitter ( pint ) - 180 @entity138 ( 100ml ) - 160 @entity139 ( pint ) – 210 @entity142 calorie breakdown … roast turkey per slice – 101 roast beef per slice – 213 nut roast - 230 stuffing ball – 123 bread sauce – 141 roast potato – 200 mashed potato – 237 vegetables – 20 christmas pudding – 330 @entity152 ( 100ml ) – 97 trifle – 220 mince pie - 230 not surprisingly , losing weight was the top @entity99 with 28 per cent of people saying it was their aim for 2015 , followed by drinking less alcohol ( 19 per cent ) , getting fit ( 17 per cent ) and eating healthily ( 15 per cent )			1
out of the group , more than one in five – 22 per cent - said they did no exercise at all , but nearly the same percentage , 19 per cent , said they trained more than five times each week			0
@entity71 added : ' most people said that their stomach was the body part they would most like to change , with more than half saying they were unhappy with theirs , followed by legs at 24 , arms at 14 per cent and bottom at one per cent			0
' the stomach is the problem area for a lot of the women i see and they usually admit they like to drink wine			0
' not only is this high in calories , but it 's strong too , so means they are likely to reach for unhealthy foods while they are drinking and afterwards			1
' @entity19 is the worst time ever for this but i think that if people are conscious about what they eat , they can get through the holidays without doing too much damage to their waistline			1
' i think it 's really positive to see a lot of people are already doing exercise , or certainly plan to in the @entity84 and hope to cut back on unhealthy food and alcohol			0
' so many people try new diets or regimes in january , and i think it 's important to make sure you find a plan you can stick too , rather than do a drastic or faddy one and set yourself up for a fall			0
' my message would be to try to eat clean and exercise when you can each day all year round , then you can enjoy @entity19 without piling on the pounds			2
