@entity1 's hopes of making a flying start to his @entity4 career have suffered a huge blow with a knee injury that will rule him out for six weeks			2
the @entity8 midfielder , who has been training with @entity4 for just four days after making a £ 23.6million switch from @entity10 , will miss the first three games of the @entity13 campaign — a home clash with his old club and trips to @entity17 and @entity18			1
he is also likely to miss the opening @entity20 qualifier away to @entity21 on september 8			1
@entity1 was hurt during a training drill on thursday and @entity4 ’s fears were realised following the results of a scan			0
had that been the case , @entity1 could have been out for 12 weeks			0
that is unlikely to be of any comfort to manager @entity30 or @entity1 , who was expected to make his debut against @entity45 on sunday			1
@entity30 was bullish when he spoke about @entity1 earlier this week , insisting he is ‘ a special player ’ and would prove value for money			0
shame : @entity1 had been in line for his @entity4 debut on their @entity51 tour but he will now miss out concern : @entity1 is lucky not to need surgery which would have ruled him out for 12 weeks			0

£ 23.6million signing from @entity10 will miss games against his former club , @entity17 and @entity18 with the injury
