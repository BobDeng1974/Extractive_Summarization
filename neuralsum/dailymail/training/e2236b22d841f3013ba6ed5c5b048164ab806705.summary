@entity1 pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of husband @entity10 after she was told by a judge at the @entity12 she would be given a suspended sentence			1
the court heard ' submissive ' @entity1 agreed to the pact with her 58 - year - old husband after he was arrested over an allegation of historic child sex abuse in 2012			1

by the time you get this we will be well dead			0
’ when the relative received the note on september 2 they informed police who forced entry into the house on september 3			2
they found @entity10 had died but @entity1 was still alive			1
