@entity0 has refused to comment on whether he offered to resign as @entity2 manager but did say he was ' 100 per cent committed ' to the club			1
the 52 - year - old has come under pressure from supporters in recent weeks , with the @entity8 giants trailing @entity9 by nine points in the race to win promotion to the @entity13 , and various reports on friday suggested he had tendered his resignation			2
@entity0 took charge of @entity2 for their match at @entity18 on friday however @entity0 took charge of the @entity20 for their @entity22 match at @entity18			1
the club have refused to comment on the story and speaking to @entity25 before the game in @entity27 , @entity0 was more interested in talking about the match			1
' i am completely focused on the game and i ca n't comment on anything else , ' he told @entity25			0
' you 'd need to task the club about all that			0
@entity2 chief executive @entity36 ( top row centre ) talks to @entity0 before the match ' i 've no idea if this will be my last game			1
' i 've no plan to talk to the board and there 's nothing on my mind other than picking up three points			0
' i can assure ( the fans ) i am 100 per cent committed on getting them back to the top			0
' and despite the hefty points difference between themselves and @entity9 , @entity0 believes his side can still go up to the @entity13 as champions			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) was the centre of attention at @entity18 ' ( @entity55 ) absolutely believe it ( we can catch @entity9 ) , ' he added			1
' i watched their game last week , we firmly believe we have to put pressure on @entity9 , no easy job that is for sure			0
' @entity0 was a real @entity62 favourite as a player , scoring 355 goals in all and was part of the @entity2 team which won nine league titles in a row in the 1980s and 1990s			1
however , @entity0 's tenure as boss since taking over from @entity71 in 2011 has been far from plain sailing			2
supporters ' criticism of his tactics and signings have increased this season in the wake of some poor performances and results			0
aside from defeats to championship rivals @entity9 and @entity84 , the @entity83 have failed to beat @entity85 in three attempts , with the recent 3 - 2 @entity88 defeat to the @entity89 - after blowing a two - goal lead - bringing @entity0 's managerial abilities under even more intense scrutiny			2
in addition to general disgruntlement at @entity2 ' performances and style of play , the seemingly - endless battle for power at the cash - strapped club over the past few years has left many fans disillusioned and that has led to falling attendances at @entity62 .			2
