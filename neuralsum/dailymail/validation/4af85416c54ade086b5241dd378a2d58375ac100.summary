it was not as if @entity1 lost to @entity2 in the sub-continent			1
these were @entity5 - type conditions and it was seamers who took the wickets , not spinners			2
that makes it even more of a diabolical result			0
players always have to take responsibility and have a good look at themselves but mistakes have certainly been made by @entity17 and this management			1
they had six months to prepare for this tournament rather than in two of the last three @entity21 when they have come in to it off the back of the @entity24			0
@entity25 walks towards his bowling mark during the @entity28 match between @entity2 and @entity1 they changed the captain just ahead of this tour which to me was not the wrong call but one made too late			1
they should have replaced @entity35 a year ago and then @entity36 could have been opening the batting for a year by now			0
then at the last minute here they came up with this cunning plan of picking @entity41 which smacked of @entity1 losing their bottle and reverting to old - fashioned type and going with the @entity44			1
and why did it take until this game for @entity47 and @entity48 to pitch the ball up ? @entity50 said it was n’t a team plan so why were they bowling too short and why did n’t someone tell them to stop it before now ? @entity1 's batsman @entity57 plays a shot as @entity2 wicket keeper @entity59 looks on @entity60 heads back to the dressing room after losing his wicket to @entity63 of @entity2 yet , in all honesty , i watched that match and i was n’t too fussed about the result because my feeling is that even if @entity1 had won and gone on to the quarter - final they would have been hammered by @entity71 , @entity72 or whoever they faced on a drop - in pitch at the @entity75			2
@entity1 are playing a different brand of cricket from the top five or six teams and the underlying problems need to be looked at as much as the position of the coach , who comes under scrutiny after every tournament disappointment			2
@entity48 slips over during the @entity28 match between @entity1 and @entity2 at @entity86 @entity87 celebrates after getting the wicket of @entity36 match at the @entity86 there are exciting players out there			1
you could tell that @entity36 had something about him two years ago			0
then there are others like @entity97 and @entity98			0
we need someone with a keen eye picking these guys out and then sending them round the world to play in the @entity104 , the @entity105 and other tournaments where they may learn			0
one - day cricket can not be an afterthought any more for @entity1			1
there is no magic fix but we must change our culture			2
let the players have a carefree attitude – not reckless – but carefree			0
then start moving forward and catching up			0
@entity57 reaches his 50 during the @entity28 match between @entity1 and @entity2 at @entity86			1

@entity1 *crashed* out of the @entity28 and it is *n't* good enough
*decision* to change the captain was not a wrong call , but one made too late
one - day cricket can not be an afterthought any more for @entity1
