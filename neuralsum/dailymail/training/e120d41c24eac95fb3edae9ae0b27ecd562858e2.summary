by @entity1 reporter published : 16:00 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 17:24 est , 5 march 2013 accident and emergency nurses in the hospital at the centre of the @entity8 care scandal were ' punished ' if they spent too much time caring for patients by ' draconian management ' , a tribunal heard today			1
nurses were often marched up to account for themselves to executives at @entity15 if they breached the four - hour limit for treating patients and ' made a spectacle of ' , it was claimed			1
the allegations came at a misconduct hearing into the standard of care provided by two nursing sisters at the hospital at the centre of the @entity24 into care at the @entity26			2
hundreds of patients are said to have died there unnecessarily			2
accused : nurses @entity30 , left , and @entity31 , right , who worked at scandal - hit @entity32 ordered staff to fake casualty records to meet waiting time targets , a hearing was told @entity30 faces five charges of misconduct relating to patient care and falsifying waiting times , and @entity31 faces six , including falsifying waiting times , patient care and racist conduct , relating to their time in charge of the @entity46 department in 2007			1
@entity47 , a former sister there , said there was a ' culture of bullying ' amongst senior management who shouted at nurses who breached waiting limits			1
she added : ' the management at the time was draconian and nurses were often marched up to the executive office in relation to breach times in the @entity46 department			2
' the @entity46 sisters would also frequently be in trouble for allowing breaches of the four - hour target			1
' she added : ' nurses were punished by the trust if they spent more time with the patients , if this resulted in them breaching the four - hour target			1
' nurses who had fewer or no breaches received high praise from management			2
nurses who had breaches were made a spectacle of and made to feel they were no good at their job			1
' whistleblower : @entity75 has claimed she was ' ostracised and had to endure constant bitchy comments ' whenever she tried to insist on putting down the true times the punishment was normally unofficial , she said , including one sister who was ' undermined in her role ' by having junior nurses do her job instead of her			0
ms @entity47 told the tribunal that in october 2007 @entity31 told a nurse , @entity75 , ' my advice is to lie about the breach time ' , when she rang through from the minor injuries section saying they had patients who were about to clock up four hours in @entity46			1
ms @entity47 told the hearing that although at the time she assumed it was said seriously , when she made a statement last year she thought it was ' off the cuff ' , and now did not know either way			0
mrs @entity75 , who gave evidence to the @entity100 , told today ’s hearing that patient records were ' routinely ' doctored in the ' chaotic ' department , which lacked a permanent manager at the time , to hide breaches in waiting time limits			0
a white board carrying patient details often had admission times rubbed out , something which would have been seen by management , she claimed			0
@entity30 is alleged to have told a seriously ill elderly patient who later died that she was a ' naughty little monkey ' who was just constipated and had not taken her laxative			2
she allegedly refused to help lift the woman from a wheelchair on to a bed , saying : ' i ’m not doing this			0
i ’m not hurting my back			0
we do n’t need to get her on a trolley anyway , she is going to breach ( waiting time target ) in a minute , ' and telling the junior doctor examining her to help with another patient			0
the woman , known as @entity129 , was discharged but died the following day from a pulmonary oedema			0
@entity30 is also accused of saying ' she can wait if you can do that to your baby ' when a woman came into @entity46 suffering from bleeding after having an abortion			1
@entity31 is accused of making racist comments , including likening an @entity139 junior doctor to a suicide bomber and describing another as ' @entity142 ’s mate '			1
a third was frequently derogatorily referred to as ' him in the turban ' , and a female gynaecologist pointed out as ' her in the yashmak ' , mrs @entity75 claimed			0
@entity31 , who was described as ' foul - mouthed ' , is also accused of swearing about patients where they could hear her , saying they ' can f * * * * * * wait ' , ' they want to get f * * * * * * real ' and ' i do n’t give a flying f * * * '			1
@entity156 , representing both women , said they did not say the things they are accused of			0
he questioned mrs @entity75 ’s memory of events six or seven years ago and accused her of targeting the nurses because of ' bad feeling ' toward them over remarks made about her mother - in - law - a nurse at the hospital - and a complaint made about her own conduct			1
ms @entity47 said @entity31 ’s dry sense of humour could be ' not politically correct ' but with no intended malice			2
' @entity31 would get very frustrated about a group of @entity139 junior doctors who would only speak to each other in their own language , which was not @entity179 , ' she said			1
' i recall that @entity31 would make tongue - in - cheek remarks highlighting that the junior doctors were being rude			1
' @entity30 and @entity31 contest the charges			1
yesterday whistleblower @entity75 said sometimes staff were in such a rush to get patients out of casualty within four hours that staff ' left patients to lie in soiled sheets to meet the targets			2
' recounting one occasion where she was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time , she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised @entity30 's handwriting			2
but the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery was hers , the panel heard			0
' i realised @entity200 would have been happy for me , a junior nurse , to taker the blame for her actions , ' said mrs @entity75			0
' as a result of this , absolutely nothing happened to @entity200 in terms of disciplinary action			0
' both @entity31 and @entity30 were eventually subjected to an internal disciplinary inquiry in 2008 , but they were later reinstated with no action taken against them			1
worrying : nurses were often marched up to account for themselves to executives at @entity15 if they breached the four - hour limit for treating patients and ' made a spectacle of ' , it was claimed during their suspension , mrs @entity75 said she ' incurred the wrath ' of their friends in @entity46			1
mrs @entity75 said of their return : ' nothing had been learned other than how to break the rules more subversively			0
' she said : ' @entity200 would deliberately make patients wait			2
black patients were being made to wait			1
' the nurse , who resigned in june 2008 because of the toxic environment , said : ' the attitude of the sisters had not changed			0
