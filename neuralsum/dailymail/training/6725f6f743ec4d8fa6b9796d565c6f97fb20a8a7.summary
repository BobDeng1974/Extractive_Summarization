@entity0 , a farmer , and @entity2 , a fruit and veg company boss , had rescued the giant horse , who was being badly mistreated and heading for the meat trade			1
after carefully nursing him back to health , @entity9 , now stands at more than 20 hands or 6ft 10in from shoulder blades to hoof , and is thought to be the biggest horse in @entity14			1
with his size comes a massive appetite and @entity9 's daily diet consists of two stone of carrots , 24 apples , 11lbs of spinach and five cabbages			1
' @entity9 had been very badly treated , was very emaciated and was going to end up in the meat trade			0
' when he came to us i thought he was too far gone to survive but he got vitamin injections and got a spark back in his eyes			0
a healthy lunch : @entity9 gets through an incredible two stone of carrots , 24 apples , 11lbs of spinach and five cabbages each day the horse was rescued from the slaughter by farmer @entity0 and @entity2 , from @entity45 , @entity46 and nursed back to health at @entity48 ( pictured ) ' @entity9 is the biggest horse in @entity50 and when i put him into the stable he hit his head off the roof			1
' he still has a bit of growing to do but already you ca n't see over his back if you are standing next to him			0
' sitting on his back would be like sitting on top of a transit van			0
thought to be the biggest horse in @entity50 , @entity9 has a massive appetite to match his enormous size , eating as much as two stone of carrots every day @entity9 lives a life of luxury at @entity64 in @entity45 where his owners look after him and his huge appetite if mr @entity2 was buying @entity9 's food at the supermarket , he would be paying out around £ 28.50 , based on average fruit and vegetable costs			1
that works out at just under £ 200 a week , £ 855 a month or a staggering £ 10,374 a year			2
two stone of carrots 11 pounds of spinach 24 apples five cabbages total daily shop £ 9.50 £ 7.50 £ 7.50 £ 4 £ 28.50 ' he is a friendly big horse but so far has pulled down three fences and when i was sat in a golf buggy , he lifted the entire thing up in his mouth			1
and @entity9 , who lives a life of luxury at @entity86 in @entity45 , will continue to grow for the next two years			0
one day he could even rival the biggest horse in the world , which is currently just three quarters of an inch taller than him			2
