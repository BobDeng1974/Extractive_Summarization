those wondering what the future holds for former @entity4 presenter @entity3 need wonder no more			2
the @entity6 co-host appears to have already launched a new career - as a documentary maker of incredibly dull things			1
the 45 - year - old , whose @entity4 future has been in doubt since @entity14 's unceremonious sacking , has released his first home video on a new channel on @entity17			1
one included a cookery demonstration on how to make a shepherd 's pie			0
but , if the title is anything to go by , it seems @entity3 is still in need of a little bit of inspiration			0
using the username ' @entity3 is bored ' , the presenter entitled the video ' bored ' , before publishing an edited version under the equally - inspired name of ' bored 2 '			1
predictably , the description reads : ' this video is about bored '			2
the amusing but mind - numbing film - which lasts for ten minutes - begins with @entity3 lying on top of a wall on his farm in @entity57			1
he is seen shouting at the top of his voice - to no one except his dog - that he is ' bored ! ' the slickly - edited video then follows @entity3 as he drives along the @entity64 and country roads to @entity65 in the @entity66 , @entity67			1
the film follows @entity3 as he takes his dog to @entity65 in the @entity66 to learn how to herd sheep amid scenes of the @entity72 in all its springtime glory , the footage follows @entity3 as he learns from local farmers about how to look after sheep			1
there are also scenes of @entity3 feeding cows before having a pint with the farmers in the local pub , the @entity82			0
@entity3 also takes time out of his farming duties to sit by a lake with his dog , pensively looking out across the water			0
but , unlike his @entity4 presenting style , @entity3 rarely speaks during the film , sharing only a few key insights such as : ' it 's raining ' and ' what are we doing ? ' the film then ends with a cliff hanger which shows @entity3 releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm in @entity96 - but realising that he has left his beloved dog behind			1
it follows the former @entity4 co-host as he drives along the @entity64 listening to radio , with his dog in the car it also shows him having a few drinks in the pub. unlike his @entity4 presenting style , @entity3 rarely speaks during the film , sharing only a few key insights such as : ' it 's raining ' and ' what are we doing ? ' two hours after promoting his film via @entity112 , @entity3 thanked his fans for their comments - but said it had not abated his boredom			1
' many comments on my little bored film			1
shall make a cutdown version next			0
when i can be bothered , ' he wrote			0
he later added : ' have made cutdown version of @entity123			0
called it bored 2 and put it on @entity17 on ' @entity3 is bored '			1
' yesterday , @entity14 - who was sacked from @entity4 last month - revealed that @entity3 was spending his days trying to train his dog			1
he wrote : ' one of my friends , who shall remain nameless - save to say that his name begins with @entity131 and ends in ichard @entity3 - decided to fill his enforced leave by training his dog			2
the film ends with a cliff hanger which shows @entity3 releasing some of the sheep back onto his farm - but realising his dog is missing in an amusing end scene , the dog is scene sitting next to the lake , worryingly looking around for her owner ' and now , after just a couple of weeks , he reports that the dog in question hates him and hides whenever he comes into the room			1
' @entity14 also reflected on the perils of being unemployed , saying he has to make everything ' last for hours ' to fill the gaping chasm left by @entity4			1
in his @entity152 column , he wrote : ' we read often about people who live on benefits , and it fills us with rage that they are sitting about with a plasma television we bought , eating chocolate biscuits that are n't bloody well theirs			0
' yet after a couple of weeks in the same boat ( well , all right , mine 's more of a liner ) , i 'm beginning to develop a bit of sympathy			0
because what the hell do they do all day to stay sane ? ' earlier this month , @entity29 also took to @entity17 to share his jobless life with friends			1
@entity3 shared his video with his followers on @entity112			0
it has already been watched more than 230,000 times in a badly - lit video , the former @entity6 presenter gave a ' masterclass ' in making a shepherd 's pie			1
the cooking activity was originally selected by his @entity112 followers , after he gave them a list of mundane scenarios which he should be filmed doing around the house			0
the cooking clip talked viewers through ' ingredients , prep and kit ' , ' cooking onions and chilli ' , ' browning meat , adding @entity194 spice ' and ' not sure '			0
he had previously posted a video showing him tackling ' greensleeves ' on his recorder while struggling with a hangover – a popular piece that has thus far notched up over half - a - million views			1
since @entity14 was sacked over the infamous ' fracas ' involving a @entity4 producer , there has been mounting speculation over @entity3 and may 's positions at the @entity6			2
bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade the pair to continue with the show , in a bid to cling on to long - term fans			2
since the unceremonious sacking of @entity14 , there has been mounting speculation over @entity3 and may 's positions at the @entity6 although both hinted separately that they do not see a future with @entity4 , they have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks			2
some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels , which may want to sign up the group as a trio			0
a source told the @entity227 : ' @entity3 is a tv presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he 's been on the show a bit longer than @entity29			1
that is a big opportunity to pass over			0
' they added : ' it would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one			2
' all three were on the cusp of signing new three - year deals when the @entity14 fracas unfolded			1
the day after @entity14 's sacking , may gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to @entity4 , suggesting he is to ‘ go back to normal life			1
’ but @entity6 bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade @entity3 and @entity29 to continue with the show , in a bid to cling onto long - term fans the presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher			1
he said : ' i might want to do something completely different with my life , i 'm quite old now			2
( i might do ) something outside of cars , i always wanted to be a teacher			0
' he also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top - rating programme , saying : ' we always knew it was n't going to last forever '			0
but the @entity6 's creative director @entity268 previously made it clear he wanted may and @entity3 to continue presenting the show without @entity14 , despite acknowledging it would be ' perfectly natural ' for them to have reservations about continuing			2
he said : ' it 's perfectly natural for them			0
they are a team they have worked together for a very long time , they are all very attached			0
' if @entity14 is not in it and @entity3 and @entity29 are , that needs to be a conversation with them as well			1
they need to be happy about what 's going on and where they think the programme needs to be			0
' may fronts several other tv programmes , including the popular @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 and @entity29 ' @entity294 with wine expert @entity293			2
