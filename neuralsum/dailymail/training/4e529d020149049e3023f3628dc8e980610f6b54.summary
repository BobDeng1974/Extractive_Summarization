a collection of letters and plans , which chart the construction and design of former @entity6 president @entity5 and his wife @entity7 's home in northern @entity9 , is set to go under the hammer later this month			1
the unique 400 - piece archive includes ten letters sent by @entity7 to the property 's architect , detailing her exact thoughts on what the home should look like - and her delight at the finished product			1
' you have done the most fantastic job and everyone agrees , ' the then - @entity23 wrote in one letter , believed to have been sent shortly after construction on @entity26 was completed in 1963 , just a few months before @entity5 's assassination on november 22			1
here , the couple is pictured at the property in an archive image from the @entity36 the finished product : @entity7 was determined to make @entity26 the perfect home for her family perfection : in her letters to the family 's architect , @entity7 expressed her thanks for the way in which they completed the house ' that house is really a dream			1
one could not wish for anything more perfect - if only we could live in it all year long ! and @entity54 [ @entity5 ] loves it - so bravo			2
' @entity7 went on to explain that she had included some images of the property so that the architect could see the finished result , however she added that she would send a further set of photographs in the fall , ' when everything is in place '			2
she signs of the letter by saying : ' a million thanks - you can always get me on the phone			0
' earlier letters included in the collection also provide a glimpse into @entity7 's relationship with her beloved husband @entity5 - who was known to his nearest and dearest as @entity54			1
' this house may not be perfectly proportioned - but it has everything , ' she wrote in one letter			0
' all the places we need to get away from each other			0
' it has everything ' : the then - @entity23 joked that the home had all the space that the family needed ' to get away from each other ' interior design dreams : the property was designed and furnished to @entity7 's exact specifications home is where the heart is : tragically , the @entity32 were only able to spend three weekends together at the property before @entity5 was assassinated in november 1963 ' so husband can have meetings , children watch tv , wife paint or work at desk , nurse [ can have ] her own room , [ the ] help a place to sit , all things so [ many ] bigger houses do n't have			1
i think it 's brilliant ! ' and while the majority of her correspondence was handwritten on lined yellow notepaper , there are also three letters printed on official @entity36 stationary included in the collection , one of which addresses speculation about when the couple actually planned to move into the property			1
it seems that there was great speculation at the time about whether the @entity32 would make the final move into their new home , with @entity7 explaining to her architect that they would not be able to visit the property until mid-october , after she had returned from a planned vacation in @entity132			1
' i can not wait to see the place in october ! ' @entity7 wrote			2
' we will come there the minute i get back from @entity132			0
' it is n't true at all that we are planning to rent it for another month ; i do n't know where that rumor started			0
' @entity140 : the property was tucked out of the way , far from any prying eyes @entity144 , @entity7 : some of the letters sent were typed on headed @entity36 stationary a suggestion : along with her letters , @entity7 also sent magazine clippings , complete with annotations about which aspect of the design she liked the most the letter was dated september 30 , 1963 , meaning it was sent less than two months before @entity7 's husband was assassinated while on a political trip in @entity155 , @entity156			1
according to reports , the couple were only able to spend three weekends at their new @entity9 - based property before he died			2
in addition to her letters , the collection also includes a number of magazine clippings , complete with annotations and notes , which @entity7 sent along with her correspondence			2
on each cutting she pointed out a design element which she felt would suit their own home - and , perhaps surprisingly , indicated her ongoing desire to keep the budget as small as possible			0
for example , on one picture of what appears to be a living room layout , she wrote : ' this kind of long window [ would be ] nice for [ the ] master bedrooms - unless too expensive			0
' it makes a good balance opposite a window - door			0
' a second cutting even includes a small drawing , indicating how @entity7 wanted the sink in her bathroom to look			2
tight budget : @entity7 indicated through her notes that she was mindful about keeping the costs of building the property to a minimum personal touch : @entity7 even included a few of her own drawings in order to illustrate her ideas the ideal escape : it seems as though the home was intended as a kind of oasis for the @entity32 ' for my bath - this this kind of sink arrangement			1
one sink , but space underneath for [ a ] stool so it can double as a dressing table			0
does n't have to be this fancy marble and woodwork etc. ' this unique collection of plans and correspondence is due to go under the hammer at the @entity219 - based @entity218 on february 19 , alongside an assortment of other @entity5 memorabilia , including a selection of photos of @entity5 and @entity7 enjoying a relaxed vacation in @entity225 with their close friends and family			1
the candid images were taken by @entity230 heiress @entity229 at @entity232 heiress @entity231 's @entity225 beach shack in august 1961 , just two years before @entity5 's assassination			1
in the images , both @entity7 and @entity5 can be seen relaxing in the company of their holiday companions , including mrs @entity231 and her banker husband @entity239 , @entity5 's closest sister @entity241 , artist @entity242 , @entity229 's husband @entity243 , and three of the @entity246 ' four children			1
in one series of photos , @entity5 can be seen eating a relaxed meal outside on the deck , while deep in conversation with his host mrs @entity231			2
his wife is pictured just a few meters away , seated alongside mr @entity256			0
intricate detail : the auction lot also includes the final design plans for the property every aspect : the plans and designs detail all the different areas of the home architectural genius : @entity7 was incredibly happy with the final result and added that ' @entity54 loves it too ' another set of images shows the then - 44 - year - old former president enjoying a swim in the bay alongside a male companion , before climbing up out of the water and onto what appears to be a dock , while reaching for a towel			1
according to @entity280 , author of @entity281 , the images offer an incredibly rare glimpse into the private lives of the @entity32			2
' they 're amazing pictures , ' she told people			0
' these were the masters of the universe in their downtime , sitting on beach chairs , smoking and eating clam chowder			0
' [ @entity5 ] is not in perfect shape and @entity7 's wearing a bathing suit your mother might have worn			1
' this is not @entity7 in @entity295 couture			0
they do n't even look like they know they were being photographed			0
' rare glimpse : alongside the @entity301 collection , @entity218 will also be taking bids for a selection of images taken of the @entity32 while they were vacationing in @entity225 a rare moment of calm : the photographs include this image of @entity5 on the dock in @entity225 @entity218 's vice president @entity310 added that images show an entirely different side to the @entity32 - showing them at their most relaxed and happy , and offering a rare glimpse into their lives away from any public scrutiny			1
' we 've sold many @entity36 photos of the family but they are always posed , ' mr @entity310 said			0
' you rarely see candid photos of the @entity32 like this			0
' @entity218 's new collections are just the latest in a long line of memorabilia to go under the hammer			0
in october last year , a set of 13 wedding negatives from the @entity32 ' spectacular wedding ceremony and celebration fetched $ 34,000 at auction , while in 2013 , a @entity332 picture depicting the exact moment in which @entity5 was shot went under the hammer in @entity334			1
surprisingly , the image , which was predicted to sell for up to $ 75,000 failed to attract a buyer , but is believed to have later been sold privately .			0

the @entity32 ' property in northern @entity9 , @entity26 , was completed in 1963 , shortly before @entity5 's assassination
@entity7 first began *discussing* the plans and construction in 1961 and her correspondence with the designer continues into 1964
the collection is due to go up for auction on february 19
