star who voiced @entity1 ogre says he wants voters to reject independence
comes after @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity13 backed the @entity2
support for @entity204 campaign has fallen to just 35 *%* , according to latest poll
the referendum is an *opportunity* ' not to save the @entity91 , but to save devolution ' ;
' *dislike* ' of @entity23 is ' not a good enough reason ' to vote no ;
there are some ' bad people ' involved in the *poisonous* referendum debate who are responsible for vile online abuse ;
all better together parties should reach ' *consensus* ' on more powers for @entity250 if there 's a no vote , and there should be a ' conference ' to decide how the @entity2 is governed in the future .
the @entity297 should be *replaced* with a senate made up of political *appointees* representing the regions and nations , *mirroring* @entity300 's second *chamber* .
