so it was n't quite the ' celebration of football ' @entity3 hoped it would be but , on this occasion , he did n't grumble			1
having made light work of progressing through @entity9 , dismantling @entity10 and @entity11 en route to the last 32 of the @entity13 , @entity7 's manager took the chance to experiment and give opportunities to the ' diamonds of our @entity17 ' in an environment free from pressure			1
but , as it turned out , this transpired to be a game that will not live long in the memory , not even for those who were given their first starts against @entity27			1
on a rain - sodden @entity28 night , @entity7 ended the @entity13 group stage with a lacklustre defeat			1
never one to dwell on a negative , he saw this as a worthwhile experiment after they overcame initial stage fright			0
' i thought the first half was really cagey , the second half was completely different , ' said @entity3			1
' they got a unique experience and after this , we have different footballers			0
it was very pleasing to see the way they progressed			0
it was just a shame we could n't get a positive result			0
' much of the interest beforehand centred on @entity53 , who had celebrated two birthdays since he last kicked a ball in public for @entity7 's first team			1
this , the @entity111 hoped , would be the beginning of what he called a ' big comeback '			0
yet a closer examination of the teamsheet showed there were other stories , not least the promotion of 17 - year - old @entity48 , a young midfielder for whom @entity3 has high hopes			2
so do @entity123 , as illustrated by @entity126 head coach @entity125 's attendance			2
@entity48 , who has been at @entity7 's @entity17 since he was five , has enjoyed a memorable 12 months			1
he signed his first professional contract in august , having lead @entity123 's under - 17s to success in @entity131 in the @entity132			0
given a key role in midfield , @entity48 worked hard and showed an impressive understanding of the game			0
he used the ball smartly and never being afraid to bark out orders to those with more experience – @entity45 , playing as a central defender , would testify to that			0
showing what @entity3 described as ' football arrogance ' , @entity48 was the pick of a bunch that included @entity147 , @entity51 – who replaced the hamstrung @entity49 – and @entity148			2
this is unlikely to be the last time you hear about him			0
' you need days like to day – it is one in a lifetime , ' said @entity3			2
' it was just a real shame that some of them were shocked in the first half but you saw what they could do in the second half			0
' @entity7 manager @entity3 ( left ) made a number of changes to his team that @entity52 ( right ) captained @entity7 's @entity175 ( left ) , @entity170 ( second left ) , @entity171 ( centre ) , @entity173 ( second right ) , @entity174 ( right , back ) , @entity165 ( right , front ) and @entity167 ( centre , front ) enjoy a night off as they watch from the stands @entity9 @entity177 @entity33 pounced on poor goalkeeper from @entity42 to score for @entity179 @entity7 , to their credit , slashed the price of tickets in an attempt to a get a healthy pre-christmas crowd – the most expensive was £ 15 – but the crackle you associate with this stadium on a @entity189 night was absent			1
this , effectively , was an exhibition match			0
still , it was one @entity7 wanted to win			2
their progress in @entity189 so far has been serene and they had the first opportunity in the 14th minute , when @entity53 latched on to a pass from @entity147 and drilled a 25 - yard shot that @entity27 keeper @entity60 beat away			1
@entity27 , though , had not travelled just to fulfil their obligations and in the 16th minute @entity68 , the @entity197 striker , burst clear and smashed a shot straight at @entity199 that left the keeper with a bloodied nose			1
the blow seemed to cloud his senses as , he was found wanting when @entity27 broke away , @entity33 , their @entity38 midfielder , latched on to a ball from @entity65 to open the scoring			1
@entity205 made his long - awaited return for @entity7 as he started the @entity13 contest against @entity27 @entity7 's on - loan @entity208 winger @entity49 hurdles a challenge from @entity27 's @entity63 @entity7 's stand - in captain @entity52 attempts a shot on goal , but he could n't find the target @entity42 was left with a bloody nose after being hit in the face by a shot from @entity27 's @entity68 @entity7 's stand - in goalkeeper receives treatment on his face from the physio to try to stem the flow of blood @entity42 should have done better			1
he did n't know whether to dive at @entity33 's feet or stand tall and did neither			1
@entity33 squeezed his shot inside the near post to leave @entity36 silent , save for the 14 cheering fans who had made a 2,000 - mile trek here from @entity229			1
a similar pattern followed after the break			0
@entity7 played at a higher tempo but never looked like equalising			2
if anything , @entity27 should have doubled their lead but @entity236 fluffed his lines after @entity42 was caught in @entity238			2
by then , they had done enough			0
' it 's part of what we want to achieve to develop our youngsters , ' he said			0
' if we do n't give them opportunities they will never learn			0

@entity33 scored the winning goal for @entity229 side in the 30th minute
@entity3 made a number of changes for the game with his team 's progress already *confirmed*
@entity7 had won @entity256 with a game to spare after three wins and two draws
the 14 @entity27 fans who made the trip from south west @entity229 were given *hospitality* by @entity7
