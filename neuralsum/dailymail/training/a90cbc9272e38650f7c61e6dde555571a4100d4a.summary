by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:21 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 27 august 2012 not so long ago , @entity2 was cruising along the freeway in @entity4 in a flashy convertible sports car			1
nothing out of the ordinary about that , you might think			0
except for one revealing detail : he was stark naked , his modesty preserved only by the steering wheel			0
how do we know this ? because a picture of him in the nude subsequently appeared on a @entity20 page			0
perhaps , then , we should not be too surprised to learn , then , that ‘ @entity24 ’ — as he is known to his friends — featured prominently in recent scandalous events in @entity22 involving prince @entity23			1
@entity23 's ' wingman ' : @entity2 , right , seems to feature prominently in prince @entity23 's recent scandals as seen here in a swimming pool in @entity22 last august @entity2 and prince @entity23 were photographed partying on the island of @entity31 , off the coast of @entity33 , where the prince jumped into a pool fully - clothed for @entity24 is @entity23 ’s best friend			1
where @entity23 goes , ‘ @entity24 ’ is usually not far behind			1
he is often called @entity23 ’s ‘ wingman ’			1
it is a misleading description			0
a ‘ wingman ’ , in flying terms ( @entity23 is a an @entity45 helicopter pilot ) , is a pilot who protects his colleague on dangerous missions by watching his back			1
but @entity2 seems often to perform the opposite role , enthusiastically accompanying , if not leading , his friend into trouble			1
he was with @entity23 on his ill - fated trip to @entity33 in august last year , when they got drunk on vodka , whisky , beer and tequila , and were photographed jumping into a pool fully - clothed at a nightclub on the party island of @entity31			1
he was with him on a skiing trip to @entity60 in november when they amused themselves by childishly hurling snowballs at unsuspecting passers - by from a balcony			1
he was with him at a party in 2010 when @entity23 was seen inhaling ‘ hippy crack ’ — otherwise known as nitrous oxide or laughing gas — a recreational drug which , although perfectly legal , has been associated with a number of fatalities			2
and , of course , @entity76 ’ — who at 25 is two years @entity23 ’s junior — was in the thick of the action in @entity75			2
he may not have appeared in those embarrassing shots of @entity23 playing ‘ strip billiards ’ in @entity79 at the @entity80			2
but he was undoubtedly there — off camera — with other members of @entity23 ’s entourage , of which more in a moment			2
@entity2 , in between falling out of this or that nightclub in various parts of the world with prince @entity23 , works in the @entity92			1
his father is @entity94 , a field - master of prince @entity96 ’s favourite hunt , @entity97 , who has made a fortune over the years from a number of businesses , including ‘ managing ’ thousands of council homes for local authorities and upmarket estates			2
the family ’s nine - bedroom country pile , @entity107 , near @entity108 , @entity109 , was sold for more than £ 7 million in 2007			0
‘ @entity24 ’ and sister @entity112 — ‘ @entity113 ’ to her friends — have known princes @entity110 and @entity23 since childhood			2
the @entity115 were regulars at @entity117 , the ‘ nightclub ’ @entity110 and @entity23 set up in the basement of @entity120			2
@entity121 has been a fundraiser for @entity123 , the @entity125 charity set up by @entity23 ( ironically , it was holding a fund - raising event in @entity4 while he was ‘ letting off steam ’ in @entity22 )			1
her brother attended @entity129 with @entity23 and co-owns a race horse with him called @entity131			2
he is credited with organising prince @entity110 ’s stag party before his wedding to @entity134			0
earlier this year , @entity2 was said to be dating flame - haired literary agent the @entity137 , 24 , daughter of lord @entity138			1
the couple recently jetted out to @entity141 — without @entity23 — to stay with @entity23 ’s ex-girlfriend , @entity142			2
it was a rare excursion without the prince because , for the most part , @entity23 and @entity2 are inseparable			1
the following episode perhaps illustrates this			0
back in the days when scandal arrived at breakfast with the @entity151 , the paper ran a front page ‘ exclusive ’ about @entity23			1
the gist of it was that he had a one - night stand with a foreign student on a trip to the @entity159 skiing resort of @entity160			0
the ‘ revelation ’ seems tame by comparison with recent events in @entity22			2
afterwards , however , sources discreetly suggested it was ‘ @entity24 ’ , not @entity23 , who had bedded the girl			2
so much for being his ‘ wingman ’			0
@entity2 is also believed to have been in the group that accompanied @entity23 on a less well - publicised trip to @entity22 late last year after a week of military training in @entity4			1
the royal ‘ hangover crew ’ spent three days partying and gambling in @entity22			2
needless to say , it was @entity23 who appeared on the gossip websites			2
photographic evidence of him flirting with a nightclub waitress was posted on the internet			0
then , as now , @entity23 and his pals stayed at the @entity80 , a gleaming back edifice in the heart of the @entity183 which houses four miles of bars , gambling halls , pole - dancing clubs and neon lights			1
@entity188 is also a favourite destination for many of our @entity191 football stars			0
on a ski trip to @entity60 , @entity159 , last november , @entity23 and ' @entity24 ' were shown throwing snowballs at passers - by from a balcony so who else is in @entity23 ’s drinking and partying gang ? @entity200 is certainly one of them			1
@entity200 , 30 , inherited more than £ 200 million on the death of his father in 2007			0
brigadier @entity204 , an adventurer and arms dealer in oil - rich @entity206 , was known in life as the ‘ @entity208 ’			0
before flying to @entity22 , @entity200 , @entity209 and @entity212 model @entity210 , @entity23 ’s most recent girlfriend , joined him for an equally wild tequilla - fuelled week on @entity214 ’s private island of @entity215 in the @entity216			1
they certainly did n’t hold back during the 27th birthday celebrations of the tycoon ’s son , @entity219			0
mr @entity200 offered friends a look inside his suitcase as he packed for the trip , which included captain @entity225 and storm - trooper costumes , a gas mask and what appeared to be a purple bong — a device that can be used for smoking drugs			0
the contents were photographed and posted online			0
the accompanying caption read : ‘ 2x flip flops , 3x board shorts , 8x fancy dress outfits , 1x toothbrush , 10x awesomeness			0
then he wrote : ‘ let the good times roll , let me roll , let me roll ! ! ! ’ three days later , @entity242 - educated mr @entity200 posted another picture on @entity20 of one of their group , who was wearing a pair of @entity248 shorts similar to those worn in @entity250 , apparently passed out in the sand , captioned : ‘ the perfect start			0
’ meanwhile , miss @entity210 provided an insight into the group ’s riotous holiday , uploading a picture of herself wearing a bright yellow bikini top and neon pink shorts , and matching pink wig			0
some members of the group , including @entity262 , returned to @entity263			0
but a handful , including @entity24 , @entity200 and @entity265 , went with prince @entity23 to ‘ @entity266 ’			1
@entity267 player @entity265 was photographed in the @entity268 at the @entity269 with the prince the following day and is a close pal of @entity23 ’s one - time rumoured love interest , tv presenter @entity273			1
he went to @entity273 ’s wedding in @entity275 recently , which was also attended by @entity277 and @entity278			0
hours after @entity23 ’s entourage arrived on friday last week , they were to be found in the aptly - named @entity281 — part of the @entity281 resort where they were staying , and where they invited a group of girls they met back to the ‘ royal ’ suite on the 63rd floor			1
letting his heir down : prince @entity23 relaxed poolside surrounded by bikini - clad girls in @entity22 before his naked antics came to light at the centre of proceedings , of course , was prince @entity23			1
or should we call him ‘ @entity300 ’ ? that is the name he jokingly used , by all accounts , during his now notorious 72 hours in @entity22			2
the pictures revealing what had taken place appeared on @entity306 , the @entity308 showbiz gossip website , which has now made a video poking fun at @entity23 and the @entity311 , who is depicted in cartoon form chastising her grandson			1
‘ poor show , ’ her caricature screams , before ordering @entity23 to ‘ apologise to the kingdom			2
’ it would be difficult to imagine a more embarrassing — or avoidable — fiasco in her majesty ’s @entity322 year in which prince @entity23 , who will shortly celebrate his 28th birthday , represented the @entity326 at the @entity328 closing ceremony just a fortnight ago			1
speaking for the first time about the @entity22 trip , @entity200 insisted none of @entity23 ’s friends would have taken the photographs			1
‘ i obviously think it is really despicable that someone would accept prince @entity23 ’s hospitality and then take these pictures , ’ he said			1
‘ i know it has put a real dampener on everybody on that holiday			0
‘ some people have been hinting it was one of his friends who took the pictures			0
but this is absolutely not true			0
none of his friends would ever do that			0
’ either way , the game of ‘ strip billiards ’ , was the prelude to non-stop drinking , flirting , and partying in which @entity23 ’s friends attended two decadent pool parties , downed cocktails as they watched go - go dancers in skimpy bikinis gyrate around stripper poles , played dice game craps in the casinos and ran up a £ 30,000 tab in the process			1
perhaps the only welcome news is that it did n’t cost taxpayers back in @entity367 a penny			0
the drinks , as they say , were on the house , courtesy of billionaire @entity373 , who owns the hotel			0
last sunday morning , @entity23 could be spotted in the one of the lobby bars nursing three @entity376			0
by his side , as ever , was @entity378			0
he is prince @entity23 ’s ‘ wingman ’ , after all .			1

@entity23 's best pal @entity2 has been photographed along side the prince as he jumped into a pool fully - clothed , chucked snowballs as passers - by and was there in @entity22 as the latest scandal took place
