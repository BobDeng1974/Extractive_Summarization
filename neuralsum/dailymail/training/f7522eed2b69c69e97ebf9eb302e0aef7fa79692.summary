@entity0 claims he and his colleagues were forced to hide under their beds after an angry mob of locals came after them when filming in @entity5 @entity0 has compared the attack by @entity5 ‘ thugs ’ on his top gear team to a violent @entity10 action film			1
the controversial presenter claims he and his colleagues were forced to hide under their beds and flee @entity5 after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them			1
locals were seething after @entity0 was filmed driving a @entity16 with the number plate @entity17 , believing it was a reference to the 1982 falklands conflict			1
the incident will form the centrepiece of @entity8 ’s @entity24 special , in a move that risks escalating the row even further			2
it will show @entity0 and his fellow presenters @entity28 and @entity30 driving three @entity32 sports cars 1,600 miles through @entity33 in southern @entity5			1
footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in the southern town of @entity39			1
@entity0 , 54 , yesterday compared the attack to a violent scene from @entity43 's 1976 @entity10 film : assault on @entity45			1
in the thriller , actor @entity46 plays a police officer who defends a @entity50 police station from heavily - armed gangsters			0
describing his experience in @entity5 , @entity0 said : ‘ i 'll warn you , it 's gruesome			1
' you get the sense that there 's a never ending supply of — let 's call them “ youths " — coming out of the darkness , hurling anything they can lay their hands on			0
‘ you would n't have wanted to be in any of the cars , that 's for sure			0
’ the @entity8 @entity24 special will show @entity0 and his fellow presenters driving three @entity32 sports cars 1,600 miles through @entity33 in southern @entity5 - including this @entity16 which sparked tensions footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in @entity39 in a @entity78 article , @entity0 continued to deny that the controversial number plate was chosen deliberately to stoke up a row and push tv ratings up			1
‘ i 've given up telling people that the @entity84 number plate was a coincidence because absolutely nobody believes me , ’ he said			1
‘ i have the email chains that show exactly why that particular car was chosen — only two were available at the right time for the right price and the other was black , a colour that does n't work on television			2
‘ everyone on the show knows the car was not chosen for its number plate and no one believes them either			1
’ the presenter admitted that his innocent explanation of the incident was not believed because the stunt was ‘ exactly the sort of thing ’ which the show is infamous for			2
he added : ‘ of course i do n't doubt that after the programme is aired many people will say that i should be ashamed of myself for putting all those innocent people in danger and that it really is time for the show to be turned into something more benign — @entity115 with windscreen wipers perhaps			0
he admitted his innocent explanation of the incident is not believed because the stunt was ‘ exactly the sort of thing ’ which the show is infamous for - pictured with fellow presenters @entity30 and @entity28 the footage of the violence will be shown on december 27 as part of the two - part @entity8 @entity33 special ‘ but here 's the inconvenient truth			0
on this occasion , for once , we did nothing wrong			0
’ last month the @entity131 announced that the @entity8 special will sit at the heart of its festive programming – alongside more traditional staples such as @entity136 , @entity135 and the last ever episodes of @entity138			1
the announcement of the @entity24 line - up came on the same day that @entity5 's ambassador to the @entity142 , @entity141 , wrote to the @entity143 expressing ' discontent ' with how the number plate fiasco was handled			1
despite the denials , many observers still think the incident was a publicity stunt			0
here ’s why : - @entity8 received an email stating the car ’s registration before it was bought			0
the @entity131 say they did not spot it			2
- the numberplate @entity155 stayed on the car for ten days after the show was warned it was offensive			0
- some filming for the show took place in @entity161 , from where doomed @entity5 warship @entity162 set off on her final voyage			2
- @entity5 police found another set of ‘ joke ’ numberplates reading @entity169 in the same @entity16			1
- the man who sold the car to the @entity131 was allegedly gagged by the corporation			2
- @entity5 accused @entity0 of exaggerating the ‘ attack ’ on the @entity8 team to improve ratings			1
she claimed @entity0 's behaviour ' fell well below @entity131 's editorial values and standards ' and called for a fresh investigation			1
the presenter said : ‘ since our return @entity141 has been stoking the fire			0
' that 's her job , and she 's good at it			0
she demanded the @entity131 apologise and scrap the programme , and when that failed she released a series of statements claiming i 'd exaggerated the incident and that when we abandoned the cars we tried to set them on fire for ‘ dramatic effect ’			2
‘ the message then is clear			0
we had tried to provoke the @entity5 into some kind of response , and when that did n't work , because they were all at home knitting jumpers and making daisy chains for handicapped children , we had invented some kind of a kerfuffle to boost the show 's ratings			1
’ the footage of the violence will be shown on 27 december as part of the two - part @entity8 @entity33 special on @entity213			0
in a departure from usual form , the video will be shown without the customary horseplay and risqué humour , for which the show is famed			0
@entity221 , @entity8 ’s executive producer , said : ‘ we ’ve been very careful to present it as it happened rather than put an agenda or spin on it			0
' viewers will make up their own mind			0
’ the programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years , including accusations of racism after @entity0 apparently mumbled the word * * * * * * during an outtake and referred to an @entity234 man as a ' slope ' during a @entity236 special			2
in 2011 , @entity28 prompted a complaint by the @entity239 ambassador after he suggested a @entity239 car would be ' lazy , feckless , flatulent , overweight ' .			0
