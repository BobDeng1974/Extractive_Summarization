teenage girls who spend hours flicking through photos on @entity2 are more likely to have body image problems that could lead to eating disorders teenage girls who spend hours flicking through photos on @entity2 are more likely to have body image problems that could lead to eating disorders , doctors have warned			1
it is not the overall time spent on the social network that is the problem , but the amount of time spent looking at pictures , they said			1
this includes looking at other people ’s albums as well as posting selfies			1
the more they look at photos on @entity2 , the more likely they are to think of themselves as too fat or as having the wrong body shape			2
that in turn leads to body image problems which can result in anorexia and other eating disorders , said researchers from the @entity27 , @entity28			0
they analysed the @entity2 use of 103 adolescent girls along with their answers to a psychological questionnaire specifically designed to test their body image satisfaction			2
little connection was found between the overall amount of time spent on the social media site and how they viewed their shape and size			2
but there was a correlation between spending a large proportion of that time looking photographs and body image problems			0
these include ' internalising ' where young girls begin to see a very thin physique , rather than an athletic one for instance , as being the ideal shape for them			0
this leaves them dissatisfied with their own size and shape , even if they are healthy and fit , researchers wrote in the journal @entity60			0
researchers @entity61 and @entity62 reported : ‘ it is not the total time spent on @entity2 or the internet , but the amount of @entity2 time allocated to photo activity that is associated with greater thin ideal internalisation , self - objectification , weight dissatisfaction , and drive for thinness			1
’ it is not the overall amount of time spent on the social network that is the problem , but the amount of time spent looking at pictures on the site the problem is that , for many teenagers , @entity2 has replaced traditional face to face conversations , said the researchers			1
this means they see others in a kind of ' digitised ' form when they see their photos of the site , rather than see the person , in the flesh , which may give them a different visual impression			0
journal editor @entity95 said : ‘ given the connection between eating disorders and body image distortion and dissatisfaction , it is important to identify contributing factors in this particularly vulnerable group			0

overall time spent on the site is *n't* a problem - it **'s** the amount of time spent looking at photos
this includes posting selfies and looking at other people **'s** albums
people who look at a lot of photos on @entity2 are more likely to think of themselves as fat so they are more likely to *develop* an eating disorder
