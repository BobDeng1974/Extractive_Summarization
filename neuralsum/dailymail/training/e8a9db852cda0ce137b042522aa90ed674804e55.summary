by @entity1 reporter published : 21:39 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 05:48 est , 16 january 2014 @entity3 -- specifically young @entity3 women -- are the least likely to be overweight , reveals recent data from the @entity6			1
but just because @entity7 are the slimmest , does n't mean that they are less likely to suffer from hypertension or other diseases , says the @entity6			0
the data is based off of @entity3 volunteers who participated in the @entity6 's @entity13 in 2011 - @entity14 to the study there had been a ' scarcity ' of health information about the minority group			2
@entity3 are younger and thinner than other @entity21 racial groups 66.7 per cent of white @entity22 are overweight compared to only 38.6 of @entity3 @entity3 had the lowest @entity23 when compared to other groups the survey found only 38.6 per cent of @entity3 adults have a @entity23 ( @entity23 ) of over 25			1
a bmi of 25 or older is the signifier of being overweight , reports the @entity28			0
the amount of @entity30 and @entity31 was astonishingly high at 66.7 per cent overweight for whites , and 78.8 per cent overweight for @entity33			1
some @entity7 are heavier than others			0
@entity3 men are more likely to be overweight than @entity3 women			2
43 per cent of men have a @entity23 of over 25 as oppose to 34.7 per cent of women			0
data from the @entity6 also shows that @entity22 over the age of 40 are more likely to be overweight than @entity22 aged 20 - 39			0
even though @entity3 's are thinner than other @entity22 , their total high cholesterol was ' similar ' to other @entity21 adults at 10.3 per cent			1
@entity3 's cholesterol was about the same when compared to other groups hispanics had higher levels of ' good ' cholesterol ( @entity48 ) than the @entity7 did at 21.8 per cent versus 14.3 per cent			1
asians may be thinner than whites and @entity31 , but they have around the same chance of having hypertension at 26.6 per cent			2
non-hispanic @entity22 had the highest prevalence of hyper tension at 42.1 per cent			1
the @entity28 reports that 1 in 20 @entity21 are @entity3 and @entity3 qualifies as anyone from @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , or @entity61 origin			2
there are 15.4 million asians in the @entity21 and that figure has increase 40 per cent since 2000			0
one of the reasons @entity7 may be skinniest is because @entity7 tend to be younger than most @entity66			0
43.6 per cent of the @entity3 population is between the ages of 20 and 39			0
19.3 per cent of @entity7 are over 60 years old compared with 31.4 per cent and 30 per @entity69 for whites			1
even though @entity7 are slim they can still be prone to hypertension regardless of weight , the cholesterol of @entity7 was about the same as whites and @entity33 but lower than @entity22 @entity7 are younger than @entity66 and may be why they are so thin			1

only 38.6 per cent of @entity3 are overweight compared to 66.7 per cent of whites and 78.8 per cent for @entity33
younger **people** are more likely to be thinner than older **people** and since @entity3 are a young minority in @entity21 , that could account for their slimness
@entity7 are just as likely to have high cholesterol or hyper tension as other groups
