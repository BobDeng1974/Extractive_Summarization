referees are ready to clampdown on the dark arts highlighted in @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ campaign			1
after another weekend blighted by grappling in the penalty area , this newspaper has called for tough action on wrestling , grabbing and shirt pulling			1
@entity11 bosses privately agree that this escalating problem needs to be tackled			1
@entity4 has been told the issue will be discussed with @entity14 , the body representing the country ’s referees			1
the clampdown is likely to take the same course as the approach to diving and two - footed challenges , with senior referees and their bosses first discussing how best to deal with the problem			1
@entity26 's @entity25 wrestles with @entity27 while on the right , @entity28 grapples @entity30 referees are ready to clampdown on the dark arts highlighted in @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ campaign @entity26 defenders @entity28 and @entity25 go to ground after they were held in the box at @entity37 @entity39 's assistant @entity38 had said @entity40 would be taken off man marking duties but he was all over @entity43 during his side 's defeat by @entity46 on wednesday @entity40 ( right ) conceded a penalty against @entity48 after grappling with @entity49 ( centre right ) they are then likely to inform managers and players how they plan to interpret the rules			1
@entity4 highlighted the issue after recent inconsistency towards blatant foul play at corners and free - kicks			1
@entity61 ’s failure to penalise @entity63 players for challenges against @entity26 came a week after @entity39 ’s @entity40 was punished with a penalty against @entity48 for a similar offence			1
‘ because it ’s not a change of law this is something the @entity14 can do almost immediately , ’ explained former referee @entity67			1
‘ it ’s simply a change of emphasis			0
@entity75 takes a tumble during @entity26 's 2 - 1 @entity77 win against @entity78 on tuesday night @entity75 uses his body to get the better of @entity78 striker @entity80 at @entity81 ‘ it ’s just a case of establishing some consistency with all 16 of them			1
do they agree it ’s a yellow card , or a penalty or so on ? ‘ once that is established they would contact the clubs and inform them that the players will be punished accordingly in future			1
when it ’s as obvious as this you have to take action			0
’ @entity26 ’s @entity75 has become the first defender to back our campaign			1
he said : ‘ there ’s a difference between touching the player , getting your arm across , and grabbing hold of somebody			1
the @entity40 one got punished recently so maybe it ’s one the referees are looking at			0
’ @entity28 , @entity26 captain ' me and @entity25 were double headlocked at every corner			2
' @entity112 , @entity113 assistant manager ' grappling			0
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ' interpretation and we 'll leave it to them			0
that 's what the referees and the officials are paid for			0
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it 's in their hands really			0
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n't have to mark anyone			0
' @entity134 , @entity135 striker ' there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			2
it was like @entity141 in the @entity63 area			2
' @entity67 , former top referee ' hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			2
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			2
' @entity150 , @entity135 defender ' defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			0
' @entity158 , @entity78 manager ' in a congested area how can you judge if someone 's been blocked ? it 's part of the game and some people are good at it			2
a local @entity168 referee came in and he was asking me about it			0
' can you show me some blocking techniques ? ' that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n't be given as penalties			2
there has to be consistency			0
' and the readers of @entity184 ... ' it 's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			2
it 's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
' @entity192 , @entity193 ' to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i 've been watching football since the @entity204 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i 've ever seen			1
' sir @entity207 , @entity209			0
