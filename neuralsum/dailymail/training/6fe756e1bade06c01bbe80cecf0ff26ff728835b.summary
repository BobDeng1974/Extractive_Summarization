@entity0 stayed on course for a second grand slam final appearance with a rout of @entity5 in the quarter - finals of the @entity7			1
after beating @entity8 on sunday for one of the best victories of her career , @entity0 picked up where she left off to defeat 13th seed @entity5 6 - 0 6 - 1			1
and the 10th seed will be a big favourite to reach the final when she takes on unseeded @entity17 player @entity16 in the last four			1
@entity5 beat @entity31 in round three and things might have been different had she taken one of four break points in the first game			1
but @entity0 saved them all and thereafter played a near perfect match , mixing aggression with control and seizing on @entity5 's weak serve at every opportunity			1
the @entity42 did not hold serve once in the match but did at least manage to break the @entity0 serve at the start of the second set			2
normal service was soon resumed , though , and it was a sign of how good @entity0 is feeling about her game that a player known for her defensive capabilities hit 26 winners			2
on top : @entity0 has reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time in three years blown away : @entity5 had no answer to @entity0 in @entity23 as she was knocked out of the @entity7 the 24 - year - old said : ' it was a great match			1
it was really tricky conditions with the wind but i stayed aggressive and it really paid off today			0
the first game was very important			0
i was a little bit nervous but i served really well after that			0
' to be in the semi-finals means so much to me			0
it 's been an up and down year but it 's an incredible feeling and it shows that hard work pays off			0
' @entity0 has beaten @entity71 in five of their six previous meetings but the @entity17 woman was equally impressive in a comprehensive victory over @entity76 earlier			2
' she 's been on tour for so long , ' said @entity0			0
' she 's very aggressive so it 's not going to be easy but i 'm so happy to be in the semis and having another chance to be here			0

@entity0 beat @entity5 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 to reach the last four
@entity84 will face @entity16 in the @entity7 semi-finals
first time @entity0 has reached this stage of a grand slam in three years
