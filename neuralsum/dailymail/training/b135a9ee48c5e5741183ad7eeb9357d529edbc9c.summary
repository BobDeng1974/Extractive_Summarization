by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 could pocket a wallet - busting £ 975,000 for winning the 143rd @entity4 but it looked like the £ 20 he pocketed from @entity6 on wednesday morning was worth just as much to him as the top prize itself			1
the @entity10 pair headed out bright and early for a practice round together at @entity12 in the calm before the @entity4 storm			1
the pair teed off around 6am and whistled round the links before breakfast , playing for their usual bet			0
@entity2 was quick to show off who shot the lowest round by celebrating wildly after picking up the crisp note from @entity6 , raising his prize in the air like he would the @entity25 if all goes to plan on sunday evening			1
@entity6 appeared to take the defeat in good spirits the 25 - year - old two - time major champion also posed for pictures with his note , beaming with pride as @entity6 was forced to watch			0
the bet could bode well for @entity2 ’s hopes of winning a maiden @entity4 title at @entity43 this week			2
@entity2 and @entity6 played a practice round together before @entity4 at @entity45 in 2011 , when the younger ulsterman was the talk of the golfing world after his record - breaking @entity50 victory at @entity51			1
@entity6 , meanwhile was the forgotten man after several years of disappointing results			0
but it was @entity6 who took the money in that bet , and he went on to break his own major duck with a flawless performance at @entity59 that week			0
winner : @entity2 , the two - time major champion , poses with his crisp £ 20 note at @entity12 on wednesday playful push : @entity6 appears to shove @entity2 in the chest as his playing partner holds his £ 20 aloft @entity65 prepared for @entity4 challenge the 45 - year - old @entity68 legend has failed to repeat his heroics that week in the three years since , but has dedicated himself to a strict new exercise regime in a bid to regain his best @entity72 has been hitting the gym five times a week , lifting heavy weights , doing little cardio work , and claims he has lost four stones since last year ’s @entity4 as a result			1
despite @entity6 ’s new slimline figure , it is @entity2 who will tee it up on thursday as one of the favourites to win the game ’s oldest prize			1
@entity87 , who won the @entity4 the last time it was held at @entity12 in 2006 but is playing in just his second tournament since major back surgery , remains the man to beat			2
@entity92 champion @entity91 , world no 1 @entity94 and defending champion @entity95 are also ones to watch by the @entity97 estuary			0
but if @entity2 fails to land his big prize , he will always have that £ 20 note as a memento of his week			0
there you go , @entity2 : @entity6 begrudgingly hands over the £ 20 note to his countryman after losing their bet			2

@entity2 and @entity6 headed out at 6am for practice round at @entity12
@entity2 scored the lowest round of the pair and held his winnings aloft
he is bidding to win his third major title when @entity4 starts *tomorrow*
and the @entity31 is among the favourites to win golf *'s* oldest prize
