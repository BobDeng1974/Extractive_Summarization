@entity1 's loss to @entity2 on friday exposed a host of deficiencies in @entity6 's line - up and will force some serious discussions about selections for @entity9 this weekend and beyond			1
some of @entity6 's men stood up to be counted against the @entity2 while others may have shown the coach enough to make him look elsewhere ahead of next year 's @entity13			1
of the 15 starters on saturday in the deceptively close 28 - 31 loss , here 's who is safe , who is set for some sleepless nights and who has to make way for the good of the team			1
@entity24 leads @entity1 off the @entity26 pitch after their 28 - 31 loss to @entity2 on saturday @entity28 @entity29 : two sharp breaks and always full of intent with ball in hand			1
defensively sound but would be good to see him at first receiver more			0
match rating : 7/10 @entity37 : another strong scrummaging display with the @entity40 prop to the fore			1
consistent and one of the few rocks in the team			2
7 @entity40 prop @entity37 is consistent and one the few rocks in @entity6 's team @entity47 : @entity1 can not blame their set - piece forwards for their problems			1
rock - solid scrummaging and carried well in both matches			2
gets better with every test match			0
7 also outstanding in the scrum , @entity47 crosses for a try after an excellent drive from @entity1 @entity56 : early knock - on against @entity2 put @entity1 on back foot and should have put @entity58 away for early try			1
otherwise industrious and making an excellent impression			0
7 @entity56 made some uncharacteristic errors but is making a big impression @entity63 : huge questions over if he should have played after head knock against @entity67			1
lineout solid and work - rate high but looked tired			2
could be rested against @entity9 but would be on fitness , not form			1
6 @entity63 ' work - rate and lineout work make him an asset and wo n't sleepless nights @entity74 : lineout throws again exemplary and work in tight superb but blotted copybook with a brainless stamp that led to a yellow			1
@entity82 ’s @entity81 worth trying			1
5 @entity74 's strong work with the lineout and in tight was undone when he earned a yellow card @entity24 ( capt ) : honest and hard - working but does not seem to be inspiring his team			1
@entity1 were second best at breakdown again			2
likely to play against @entity9 but perhaps it should be at blindside			2
6 @entity24 is supposed to be leading the team as captain but they are n't even winning the breakdown @entity95 : early knock - on set the tone for @entity1 ’s wobbly opening and will be frustrated by lack of opportunities			1
lacks a kicking game but merits consideration			0
6 @entity95 's lack of a kicking game works against him but he can be dangerous when given a chance @entity105 : what is the point in picking the @entity109 ace if he is hardly going to see the ball ? capable of individual brilliance but needs to get more involved			2
6 if @entity105 is n't given the ball and a chance to use his blistering speed in space he should n't be picked @entity58 : like @entity118 before him , @entity1 ’s inside backs failed to release the @entity82 flyer			2
not a bad first start by any means but if @entity118 is fit , he could return			0
6 the inside backs are letting @entity58 down by not giving the @entity82 star early ball @entity126 : never anything other than committed and brave but questions over lack of creativity persist			0
@entity131 would offer a far greater attacking threat			0
6 @entity126 's immense strength is his weakness with the fearless centre offering little creativity almost certain to go @entity138 : ( subbed by @entity139 ) looked rusty and short of fitness again			0
kicking from hand is below par and is n’t getting the line going			0
@entity144 is worth a shot			0
5 @entity138 is short of fitness and struggling with his kicking ... @entity144 's form warrants a shot @entity150 : ( @entity151 63 ) a 50th cap for the @entity153 9 will not be remembered as his finest			0
lacked zip and pass was laboured			0
5 @entity150 marked his 50th test with a performance he 'd prefer to forget @entity159 : carried well but gave away too many penalties and will be frustrated by breakdown work			0
@entity1 ’s back row is getting outshone with alarming regularity and with @entity164 in form a change should be made			2
6 with ball in hand @entity159 impressed , but he gave away too many penalties and lacked at the breakdown @entity171 : ( @entity172 44 ) his worst display in an @entity1 shirt			1
carried valiantly but knocked on too often			0
huge future but needs a break to improve his all - round game			0
@entity172 will start next week			0
4 @entity171 gave his worst performance for @entity1 and @entity172 will get his chance against @entity9			1

@entity1 's 28 - 31 loss to @entity2 poses a host of selection questions
@entity37 was strong in the scrum and consistent , so earns his place
@entity63 will only be left out of the side against @entity9 to be rested
@entity74 's brain snap to be *sin* - *binned* puts @entity81 into the frame
@entity171 delivered his worst display in an @entity1 shirt on saturday
