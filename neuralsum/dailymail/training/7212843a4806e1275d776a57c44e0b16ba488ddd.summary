the colourful flash of a red squirrel in the trees is a spectacle few @entity3 have had the pleasure to witness			1
after more than a century of decline , experts say the plight of the native red squirrel may have finally turned a corner			1
fewer than one in 20 of us in @entity11 have ever seen the distinctive animal , according to a recent @entity14 survey			1
research by @entity16 reveals that the animals have been spotted in parts of the @entity19 , the @entity20 and @entity21 for the first time following a century of decline but it could be an increasingly common sight after conservation work has helped the native species make a comeback in areas where it has not been seen for years			1
research by @entity16 reveals that the animals have been spotted in parts of the @entity19 , the @entity20 and @entity21 for the first time in decades			0
the success is mostly down to a huge effort to control invasive grey squirrels , which were introduced to @entity11 from @entity35 in 1876 but carry a pox virus that is fatal to its red cousin			1
as a result grey populations grew to 2.5 million while the number of red squirrels fell to 120,000 – mostly in @entity43			1
just 15,000 remained in @entity44 – mainly in northern areas like the @entity46 and @entity47			0
none exist in the @entity49 , apart from isolated pockets on the @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity53			0
however , conservation work has helped boost populations , which grew by seven per cent last year			1
prince @entity56 ( pictured ) recently ordered a cull of grey squirrels on his @entity60 lands the latest work reveals that the number of reds in the @entity20 held steady – but they have expanded their territory			1
new sightings this year include @entity67 in @entity19 , @entity68 in @entity69 and @entity70 in @entity21			0
despite the grim historic trends , experts say efforts to control and cull greys is paying dividends			2
colonies are stable in @entity77 and @entity47 , according to @entity16			0
@entity78 , project manager at @entity79 , told the @entity80 : ‘ in several areas , red squirrels appear to be re-establishing range long since lost			2
‘ @entity84 will tell how persistent these new pockets of red squirrels are but they are all close to areas where high quality conservation work is in place			1
we think this is really exciting ! ’ a recent @entity91 study found some red squirrels in northern @entity44 may be becoming immune to the squirrel pox virus			1
the more likely reason for the boosted figures are huge efforts to control greys			0
dr @entity98 , head of nature conservation at the @entity100 , said : ‘ it looks like we might be turning a corner with red squirrels			1
there is optimism , cautious optimism , but definitely optimism			0
‘ personally , i have never been more positive about the future of red squirrels			0
it is down to some really hard work			0
‘ this does n’t mean that we can be complacent			0
we still need to manage grey squirrels and there are huge areas of @entity11 where we have no red squirrels at all			1
’ fewer than one in 20 of us in @entity11 have ever seen the distinctive animal , according to a recent @entity14 survey he added : ‘ removing grey squirrels seems to be key			1
we have seen that when you remove grey squirrels , you get red squirrels coming back - it is that simple			2
’ prince @entity56 recently ordered a cull of grey squirrels on his @entity60 lands , and the government is encouraging others to follow suit			2
the @entity129 agrees that controlling grey squirrels is essential if red squirrels are to thrive			2
earlier this month it published a new policy offering landowners grants of £ 100 a hectare to shoot grey squirrels			0
it has also insisted that landowners have a plan in place to reduce grey squirrel populations if they want to apply for other woodland funding			0
the @entity129 had considered making it a legal requirement that all landowners shoot a certain number of grey squirrels a year , but that plan was ruled out after a public consultation			0
the new policy says ‘ incentives ’ are key to reduce grey squirrel populations			0
it adds : ‘ where grey squirrels are causing problems , land owners and managers are critical to the success of policy implementation by taking responsibility for controlling grey squirrels on their land			2

after century in decline experts say red squirrel may have turned corner
less than one in 20 *people* in @entity11 have ever seen the distinctive animal
conservation work has seen the native species make a comeback recently
success is down to huge effort to control invasive grey @entity35 squirrels
