overweight 11 - year - olds did less well at school at 16 , a new study has found its damage to health is well known , but obesity could also harm a child ’s exam success			1
a study found that girls who were dangerously overweight at 11 did less well at school at 16			1
the effect was big enough to make the difference between gaining a c and a d at @entity17			1
the @entity19 researchers said that while the health effects of obesity receive a lot of attention , the problems do not end there			0
they also warned that the knock - on effects could be lifelong			2
latest figures show that almost 20 per cent of 10 to 11 year olds in @entity28 are obese			1
a further 15 per cent are overweight			1
the researchers analysed data from a long - running study of children born in the @entity34 area in the early 1990s			1
this included iq at age eight , weight through the teenage years and school results			2
no clear effect was found for boys but crunching the figures showed that girls who were obese at 11 did less well in tests at 11 and 13			1
they also fared less well in maths , science and @entity28 gcses at 16			1
the study , published in the @entity50 also showed that the longer the child was obese , the bigger the effect on their schoolwork			1
strikingly , the effect of obesity remained even when factors such as socio - economic status , the amount of exercise done and depression were taken into account			2
@entity63 , measured at age eight , was also factored in			0
given this , the researchers are n’t entirely sure why obesity affects how a child does at school but some research has suggested it slows the development of the brain			2
it is also possible that the psychological scars of obesity run deep			0
for instance , bullying by other children may lower self - esteem and lead to youngsters taking more time off school and so missing lessons			2
teachers may also treat obese children differently to their normal - weight classmates			2
the researchers tried to account for depression the study but say they may not have been able to factor in the full effect of the stigma of obesity on mental health			0
teenage boys are thought to be less sensitive to the effects of bullying than girls , perhaps explaining why no link was found for males			0
researchers analysed data from a long - running study of children born in the @entity34 area in the early 1990s , including iq at age eight , weight through the teenage years and school results ( library image ) with poor school grades having a knock - on effect on higher education and employment , the effects of being obese as young as 11 could be long - lasting			1
lead researcher , professor @entity112 , of the @entity113 , said : ‘ further work is needed to understand why obesity is negatively related to academic attainment but it is clear that teenagers , parents and policymakers in education and public health should be aware of the lifelong educational and economic impact of obesity			0
’ @entity126 researcher dr @entity125 said : ‘ the key message is that obesity has a wide - reaching impact and we need to be doing more to help children attain a healthy lifestyle			0
’ dr @entity132 , chairman of the @entity133 , hit out at schools for rewarding children with chocolate and punishing them by stopping them from playing football			0
he added : ‘ it is not only academic achievement , marriage and university prospects are also lower in obese kids			0
‘ it is very worrying and it is another dimension to the obesity problem			0
‘ everybody thinks about obesity and diabetes but when you think that success in life is affected by your weight , it is pretty serious			0
