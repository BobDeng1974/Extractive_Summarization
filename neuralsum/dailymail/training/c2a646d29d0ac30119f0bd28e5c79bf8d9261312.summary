by @entity0 published : 00:50 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 00:54 est , 3 march 2013 police still searching for the parents of a @entity5 baby found abandoned in a @entity7 bag are exploring whether her rare newborn tooth could help them track down her parents , they said today			1
@entity11 , who was named by hospital staff , was discovered by a dog walker abandoned outside an apartment block in @entity15 on february 19			1
police have since tried to find the infant 's parents and hope the tooth may prove a link to her family history according to @entity21			1
@entity22 : @entity11 smiles for the cameras despite coming close to death			1
she was found dumped in a plastic bag in @entity5 on february 19 abandoned : child protective services are looking for her parents so they know her medical history an early or natal tooth is seen in just one in 2000 births and is an extra tooth which is either removed or goes away before normal baby teeth arrive			1
police believe @entity11 's mother did not receive pre-natal care which is why it is proving so difficult to track her down but say they hope other relatives realize the tooth link and come forward			1
@entity41 police previously released composite sketches of what @entity11 's parents could look like in a bid to try and find them			1
the pastel renderings created by a forensic sketch artist depict a man and a woman with facial features combining @entity11 's traits , like her grey eyes and thick dark hair			2
the @entity54 said in a statement that the portraits are based solely on @entity11 's photo and not on the description of any possible witnesses			2
artist @entity60 did an age progression of what @entity11 would look like as a young woman to deduce what her mother and father could look like			2
‘ it might just look half like one and half like the other , ’ @entity67 told the @entity68			0
' i think i have a 50 per cent chance of the sketches looking more like one than the other			0
’ the artist conceded that such factors as weight gain , dyed hair and acne make the process less precise			0
@entity67 , who made it into the 2008 @entity82 as the @entity83 , has created age progressions in other cases involving children , but never as young as @entity11			2
it is believed @entity11 , who weighed just four pounds and still had about three inches of umblical cord attached , was premature			1
she was naked , but her body temperature was normal , suggesting that she had not been outside for a long time and someone had cleaned her up after the birth			0
content : the newborn has been placed in foster care and a judge will decide her future tomorrow mom and dad : an artist created these pastel portraits of what baby @entity11 's mother , left , and father , right , might look like using age progression and combining the child 's facial features she was treated and named at @entity107 before being released into foster care			1
' she was very healthy … did n't have a fever , ' @entity109 with the @entity110 told @entity112			0
' fortunately , she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements that evening			0
' @entity109 said the parents do not have to claim the baby but that a discussion with them would be useful to identify @entity11 's family 's medical history			1
' so the person who is adopting this baby can have some more genetic family medical background on the baby to be able to raise her with more knowledge or information about her , ' @entity109 said			0
tomorrow a hearing will be held to decide whether @entity11 should continue in temporary care or the adoption process should begin			1
@entity54 spokeswoman @entity126 said once custody issues are resolved they had no doubt they could settle her into a new home			0
' [ @entity11 ] will be placed in a loving home , ' she said			2
' there is no shortage of people who want her '			0
officials with the @entity136 said they have few leads on the parents as there were no surveillance cameras in the area where she was abandoned			0
' if it had not been for the resident that came out to walk her dogs , that child may have laid there all night , possibly would 've died , ' an officer said			0
the case was particularly bizarre as @entity5 has a @entity151 law which allows anyone to drop off a child with the authoritioes without facing any legal repercussions .			0

@entity11 was found by a dog walker when she was just a few hours old on february 19
the newborn , later named by hospital staff , had been dumped in a @entity7 bag with her *umbilical* cord still attached
police today revealed she already has a bottom tooth which is a rare genetic trait in newborn babies and could help establish a link to her parents who abandoned her
@entity11 is currently in foster care but a judge will tomorrow decide whether her case should be progressed to adoption
