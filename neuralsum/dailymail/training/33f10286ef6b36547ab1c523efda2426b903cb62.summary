with a car boot full of fizzy drinks , crisps and sweets , it is hardly surprising that he is popular with pupils			1
but parents and teachers are furious at the mobile trader who has set up shop at the gates of their school			1
they accuse him of shamelessly cashing in on their children ’s appetite for junk food – and in one of the worst areas for childhood obesity in the country			2
cashing in : the unnamed trader has converted his @entity24 into a fully - stocked sweet shop			1
he parks the customised vehicle outside @entity27 in @entity28 every morning using his people carrier as a makeshift shop complete with signs and a till , the trader was selling 500ml bottles of fizzy drinks for 50p and bags of crisps for 30p – around half the price of shops			1
but his days of dubious enterprise could be numbered			0
the local council is considering outlawing him from the vicinity of the school after receiving complaints from parents			2
@entity27 in @entity28 , catering for 1,350 children aged 11 to 16 , is in an area where a staggering 40 per cent of teenagers are overweight			1
parent @entity48 , 40 , said : ‘ you see in the news about children getting fat because of chocolate , crisps , that sort of thing , and this man is ruthlessly exploiting that			1
sour taste : teachers say the man is exploiting teenagers in an area where 40 % are obese ‘ it ’s disgusting the way he is deliberately targeting children when he knows their parents will not be looking			1
to me , it ’s no different than a drug dealer peddling drugs to addicts			0
he must see overweight pupils and think he ’s quids in			0
’ schools in the area have also reportedly had problems with vans selling chips , burgers and kebabs			2
parent and school governor @entity80 said yesterday : ‘ i do n’t want my children exposed to these traders			2
‘ my children say there are often mega-queues , often snaking out on to the road , and they know some students have to run off the road because traffic is coming			2
‘ my children also say they have heard that some students are often late to classes , as the trader will always stay until the last student is there			1
’ headteacher @entity94 , said : ‘ we have an issue with a tuck shop van parking outside of the school gates at the start and end of the day			0
i have had numerous conversations with the owner of the van about the issues that he is causing			0
’ @entity103 has now said it will ban the man from operating outside the school gates			0
councillor @entity106 said : ‘ it is worrying the easy access that schoolchildren have to junk food outside the school gates , and that they are potentially spending their dinner money on fizzy drinks and chocolate bars instead of , or on top of , a balanced school meal			0
cheap : the man sells 500ml bottles of fizzy drinks for 50p and bags of crisps for 30p , half the price they can be bought for in shops			0
the prices attract hundreds of pupils every morning crowds gather : parents say their children form ' mega queues ' beside the vehicle , which often snake into the street			1
there are calls for the man to be banned from selling sweets anywhere near the school ‘ it ’s up to all of us , including schools and parents , to make sure schoolchildren are making better choices about what food and drink they choose			1
’ the trader refused to comment			0
the scenario carries echoes of one at @entity149 near @entity150 , where mothers delivered fast food to children in defiance of @entity156 ’s 2005 healthy school meals campaign .			0
