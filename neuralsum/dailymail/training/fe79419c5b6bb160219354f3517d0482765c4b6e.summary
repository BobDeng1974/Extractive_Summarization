she was diagnosed with rare systemic sclerosis in 2008 which is slowly attacking her major organs - and will eventually lead to her death if left untreated			1

she was handed a card before flying home from her 2003 tour warning her she had been in contact with radioactive materials			2
she currently survives on 18 pills a day , costing over £ 3,000 a month			2
now , she believes her only hope is to have a stem - cell transplant in a bid to regenerate her organs			1
but the procedure is not available on the @entity35 and the health service has said it can not pay for her transatlantic care			0
she is is now trying to find £ 110,000 to fly out for an operation in @entity39 after being turned down for funding by a host of charities			0
