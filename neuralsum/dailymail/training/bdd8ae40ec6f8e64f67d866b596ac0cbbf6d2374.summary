a suspected looter in this week ’s riots and his mother are being thrown out of their council home			1
in the first case of its kind , @entity5 , 18 , and his mother have been served with an eviction notice as council bosses seek to turf them out of their £ 225,000 taxpayer - subsidised flat			1
@entity5 is charged with violent disorder and attempting to steal electronic goods from the @entity15 store at @entity16 , @entity17 , on monday night			1
@entity18 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity19 , has been served with an eviction notice after being charged with violent disorder under housing rules his mother – as the tenant – can be evicted from their two - bedroom flat in @entity25 if anyone living there is involved in criminality			1
there is likely to be a flood of similar cases as council leaders across @entity33 respond to public demands that looters face the toughest penalties possible			2
in another day of dramatic developments : @entity5 was arrested after more than 100 looters went on the rampage on monday night			2
for two hours , the mob ransacked mobile phone stores and sports shops such as @entity43 and @entity44			0
he appeared before magistrates in @entity25 on wednesday and pleaded not guilty to burglary and violent disorder			0
he and two co-defendants were remanded in custody			1
couple : @entity5 and @entity19 are currently both in custody after this week 's riots should rioters have their benefits taken away from them ? should rioters have their benefits taken away from them ? now share your opinion last night @entity57 , the leader of @entity58 , which issued the eviction notice , said he wanted the ‘ strongest possible action ’ taken against rioters and looters			1
‘ this council will do its utmost to ensure that those who are responsible pay a proper price , ’ he said			2
‘ ultimately this could lead to eviction from their homes			1
‘ our officers will continue to work with the courts to establish the identities of other council tenants or members of their households as more cases are processed in the coming days and weeks			2
‘ most residents on our housing estates are decent law - abiding citizens who will have been sickened at the scenes they witnessed on their tv screens this week			2
‘ as much as anything else we owe it to them to send out a strong signal that this kind of violence will not be tolerated			0
’ but @entity5 ’s mother said her human rights had been ‘ taken for granted ’			1
@entity93 - born @entity92 , 43 , said : ‘ i understand there are people who have got to face justice because all this has been madness and savagery			2
‘ but , i believe our human rights have been completely taken for granted			1
@entity5 was just in the wrong place at the wrong time			1
‘ as a mother , i ’m not responsible for my son ’s actions and they are penalising me for his actions			1
’ the part - time worker said the decision had left her ‘ very upset ’ and she did not know where she and daughter @entity109 , eight , would go			1
tough justice : police arrest a man for looting in @entity16 in south @entity17 on monday crime does n't pay : an online petition demands welfare - dependent rioters convicted of offences linked to disorder should surrender their state handouts @entity5 is being held at @entity120 , and his mother said he was ‘ terrified ’ of other prisoners and gangsters			1
she said : ‘ the other prisoners have been threatening the rioters			2
@entity5 does n’t know how to fight or defend himself			0
it ’s breaking my heart right now			0
i left him so afraid			0
’ she claimed her son helped out in the community and had no history of trouble			2
‘ he ’s a staunch member of the church , ’ she said			0
‘ my son did n’t have a hoodie or balaclava			2
his face was clean and open			0
he ’s even been diagnosed with depression because he ’s too passive			0
’ she added that his girlfriend @entity138 , 18 , who was also arrested , had a promising career ahead of her			0
she said : ‘ she ’s a nice girl , not a troublemaker			0
she was going to start an apprenticeship this september in event management and work part - time at a casino at @entity146 shopping centre			1
’ aftermath : a shop damaged by fire in @entity16 following monday night 's riots smash and grab : looters help themselves at a store in @entity153 ( left ) while a local chemist in @entity155 , right , was completely trashed yesterday other councils including @entity157 and @entity158 announced plans to evict the families of trouble - makers hauled before the courts for looting			1
bosses at @entity165 said they are preparing to evict the family of a 12 - year - old boy photographed stealing a £ 7.49 bottle of wine from a @entity171 ’s store			1
the boy was charged with burglary and was given a nine - month referral order on thursday , which means he must see a probation ofﬁcer once a fortnight			1
his 33 - year - old mother , who has a 14 - year - old daughter and a husband soon to be released from prison , said losing their home was her ‘ biggest fear ’ but admitted there was no excuse for his behaviour			1
on a visit to @entity157 yesterday , @entity188 repeated his determination to see looters evicted from council houses			1
‘ for too long we ’ve taken a too - soft attitude towards people that loot and pillage their own community , ’ he told @entity194 ’s @entity193			2
‘ if you do that you should lose your right to the sort of housing that you ’ve had at subsidised rates			0
obviously , that will mean they ’ve got to be housed somewhere else			0
‘ they ’ll have to find housing in the private sector and that will be tougher for them , but they should have thought of that before they started burgling			0
’ and speaking during a visit to riot - hit businesses in @entity157 , deputy prime minister @entity216 made it clear that it was right that local authorities should consider eviction			1
he said : ' if you go out and trash other people 's houses , you burn cars , you loot and smash up shops - in other words , if you show absolutely no sense of respect to your own community - then , of course , questions need to be asked whether the community should support you in living in that community			1
' i think that is a perfectly fair question to ask , but how you apply it needs to be done in a case - by - case way			0
' the principle that if you are getting some support from the community , you are going to have to show some loyalty to that community is a really , really important one			0
' labour leader @entity246 , in @entity153 , added : ' when council tenants sign agreements they sign up to agreements about behaviour , and local authorities have powers to deal with those things			0
' what local authorities need to do is weigh up the decisions that they are making			0
if they think there are ways in which we can encourage parental responsibly then they should make those right decisions but they should always do so in a way that is actually going to help local communities and not harm them			0
' earlier this week a petition calling for the thieves to lose all their welfare handouts became the first to be passed to @entity268 under a new scheme			0
it gathered more than 100,000 signatures – the threshold to trigger a @entity274 debate			0
the petition received so much web traffic that it crashed under the strain .			0
