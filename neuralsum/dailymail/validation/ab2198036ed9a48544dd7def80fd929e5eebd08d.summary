worsening droughts in the @entity2 - dubbed the ' lungs of the world ' - are speeding up climate change , scientists have warned			2
trees are absorbing up to a tenth less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during droughts and the forests actually emit more carbon than they capture			1
the last dry spell in 2010 saw the forest release eight billion tonnes - as much as the annual emissions of @entity15 and @entity16 combined			1
worsening droughts in the @entity2 - dubbed the ' lungs of the world ' - are speeding up climate change , scientists have warned			2
pictured is an view of a river boat trapped on the @entity23 do @entity24 during one of the worst droughts ever recorded on october 21 , 2005 in the @entity2 region in @entity28 in an average year the basin absorbs about 1.5 billion tonnes of co2 from the atmosphere but prolonged dry spells are due to become more common			1
the @entity34 study provides the first direct evidence of the rate at which individual trees in @entity39 's greatest rainforest ' inhale ' carbon from the atmosphere during a severe dry spell			1
it found photosynthesis - the process by which trees convert the greenhouse gas into energy - slowed down by 10 per cent over six months			1
dr @entity49 said : ' @entity51 rainforests have been popularly thought of as the ' lungs ' of the planet			0
the latest findings published in @entity55 confirm fears that the days of the legendary rainforest curbing the impact of rising emissions could be coming to an end			2
a researcher is pictured here measuring tree diameters in @entity63 , @entity64 , soon after the 2010 drought ' here we show for the first time during severe drought the rate at which they ' inhale ' carbon through photosynthesis can decrease			1
' the 2005 drought in the @entity2 was described as a ' once a century ' event - but five years later an even worse one followed raising concerns about the region 's capacity to continue soaking up carbon dioxide			1
the latest findings published in @entity55 confirm fears that the days of the legendary rainforest curbing the impact of rising emissions could be coming to an end			2
the 2010 drought saw the @entity2 at its lowest levels for half a century with several tributaries completely dry and more than 20 municipalities declaring a state of emergency			1
both droughts were associated with unusually warm seas in the @entity89 off the @entity28 coast - the suspected result of manmade emissions - and suggesting drought years in the @entity2 could become more common			1
some computer models of climate change project more droughts across the region as the planet warms - and a diminishing capacity to absorb @entity100			1
last month , a @entity102 satellite revealed the stunning link between the @entity105 desert and the @entity2 rainforest			0
for the first time it showed vast dust clouds travelling high in the atmosphere			0
scientists have not only measured the volume of dust , they have also calculated how much phosphorus – remnant in @entity105 sands from part of the desert 's past as a lake bed – gets carried across the ocean from one of the planet 's most desolate places to one of its most fertile			0
the data show that wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the @entity105 at @entity133			0
this volume is the equivalent of 689,290 semi trucks filled with dust			0
the dust then travels 1,600 miles across the @entity89 , though some drops to the surface or is flushed from the sky by rain			0
near the eastern coast of @entity145 , at @entity143 , 132 million tons remain in the air , and 27.7 million tons – enough to fill 104,908 semi trucks – fall to the surface over the @entity149			0
about 43 million tons of dust travel farther to settle out over the @entity151 , past @entity152			0
the three year study measured the growth and photosynthesis rates of trees at 13 rainforest plots of up to 500 trees across @entity28 , @entity64 and @entity159 - comparing those affected by the strong drought of 2010 with unaffected plots			1
the @entity2 drought of 2010 occurred right in the middle of the study but only affected some parts of @entity167			0
researchers found that while the rate of photosynthesis was constant among trees on plots unaffected by drought , rates on the six drought - affected plots dropped significantly - as compared with before the 2010 drought			2
there was up to a trebling in some sites in numbers of trees dying in the years after the drought - making them no longer available to absorb co2 from the air			1
dr @entity49 said : ' this decreased uptake of carbon does not decrease growth rates but does mean an increase in tree deaths			2
' as trees die and decompose the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase - potentially speeding up climate change during tropical droughts			1
' the results support the findings of a paper published last year in @entity55 published last year based on aircraft data			0
professor @entity202 added : ' these plots are our canaries in the climate change coal mine			0
as this study demonstrates they can give us important early insight into the actual mechanisms of how these complex forests are responding to extreme climates			0
' only through painstaking monitoring , like this , can we hope to understand and realistically model and predict the two - way interactions between climate change and the biosphere			0

trees absorb a tenth less co2 from the atmosphere during droughts
2010 dry spell saw forest release 8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide
this is as much as annual emissions of @entity15 and @entity16 combined
trees may be channelling more limited energy *reserves* into growth
