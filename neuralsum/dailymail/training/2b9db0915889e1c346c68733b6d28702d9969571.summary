teaching is one of the few professions where women vastly outnumber men , but it appears that does not protect them from suffering sexism			0
a new study has found that students tend to rate male teachers more highly than their female counterparts during an online course , even if the lessons were actually given by a woman			1
the students gave the male teachers better ratings for professionalism , fairness and respectfulness			1
male teachers appear to be more highly thought of by students , which can hamper the careers of female teachers even though they tend to dominate the profession			1
in @entity25 60 % -80 % of teachers are female they also thought the male teachers gave more praise , were more enthusiastic and were more prompt			1
the findings starkly illustrated the extent to which sexism exists even in educated people , the researchers said			2
ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male - dominated industries , according to a controversial study			0
research by professor @entity39 , a psychologist at @entity40 , suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women			0
she asked women to apply for leadership roles in male - dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates ' suitability			2
some of the women were asked to emphasise ' masculine - like ' traits such as assertiveness , independence and raw ambition			0
others were asked to display more ' feminine traits ' - warmth , supportiveness and a nurturing nature			0
the panel , irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it , decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process			0
@entity71 , lead author and a sociologist at @entity73 , said : ' we found that the instructor whom students thought was male received higher ratings on all 12 traits , regardless of whether the instructor was actually male or female			1
' if the results of these evaluations are inherently biased against women , we need to find ways to address that problem			0
' the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity90 , asked 43 college - aged students to complete an online course , dividing them into four groups of eight to 12 people			1
the sex of the students is not known			0
a female instructor led two of the groups , while a male instructor led the other two			0
however , the female instructor told one of her groups that she was male , while the male instructor told one of his groups that he was female			2
the students , however , were not told about this while they completed the online course			2
they were then asked to rate the teachers in online feedback forms			1
the results showed that when the students thought their teacher was a man they gave them an average rating of 4.35 rating out of 5			1
students taking an online course gave teachers they were told were male higher ratings than those they thought were female , even when the lessons by the ' male ' teachers were given by a female			1
this chart shows the mean student ratings by actual and perceived instructor gender			0
the difference between the two columns on the right hand side of the graph is deemed to be significant by the researchers male teachers were rated as being more respectful , more professional and giving more praise than women but if they thought they were female they rated them at just 3.55			1
miss @entity71 added : ' students rated the male identity significantly higher than the female identity , regardless of the instructor â€™s actual gender , demonstrating gender bias			2
' given the vital role that student ratings play in academic career trajectories , this finding warrants considerable attention			0

sociologists at @entity73 asked 43 students to complete an online course and then rate the *quality* of their teachers
some students were told their tutor was male but they were actually female
the results showed that if students thought their tutor was male they gave them an average rating of 4.35 on a five point scale
when students thought their teacher was female , even if they were actually being taught by a man , they gave the tutor an average rating of just 3.55
the researchers say the results illustrate the extent of sexism in society
