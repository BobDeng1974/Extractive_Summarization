no sooner had @entity0 made a tearful exit from the @entity2 than @entity3 were closing ranks to insist that they can prosper at home and abroad without their talismanic striker			1
@entity0 limped off with damaged ligaments in his left knee just 75 seconds into the 1 - 0 victory over @entity11 after tangling with @entity11 midfielder @entity12			1
@entity3 ’s 19 - goal top scorer is almost certainly out of wednesday ’s decisive @entity19 showdown with @entity20 and , most likely , the majority of the busy festive programme after the @entity16 champions won their fourth league game in a row to cut @entity24 ’s lead at the top to three points			1
@entity0 goes down holding his knee early in the game with @entity11 and was forced to go off the @entity3 striker has suffered knee ligament damage and could miss the @entity20 clash @entity0 looked in pain as he hobbled off the field in the first five minutes of the 1 - 0 win over @entity11 53.1 % - scored or assisted 17 of @entity3 ’s 32 @entity16 goals this season ( 53.1 per cent )			1
7 - @entity0 ’s goals alone have won @entity3 seven points this season - more than any other player besides @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) and @entity44 ( @entity45 )			1
2 - without @entity0 ’s goals @entity3 would drop from second to fourth in the table on 26 points - 10 behind @entity24			1
their goal difference would also drop from +18 to +4			0
4th - @entity49 also has the fourth - highest shot accuracy ( 60.71 per cent ) and shot conversion rate ( 25 per cent ) of all players with 20 shots or more			0
those who have , in recent weeks , questioned whether @entity3 are becoming a one - man team are about to get their answer			1
with @entity58 injured and @entity59 fit only to play the last half an hour from the bench , @entity57 sent on @entity62 in place of @entity0 for only his second @entity16 appearance			2
the decision to allow @entity66 to return to @entity67 on loan with @entity69 last summer without signing a replacement now seems more curious than ever			0
@entity71 , who won the penalty that enabled @entity73 to score the decisive goal , said : ‘ people can say whatever they want if they think we ’re a one - man team			1
some people have been saying @entity24 had won the league 10 games in and here we are with a three - point gap			0
‘ losing @entity0 will be a big miss. he is a world - class player , one of the best on the planet , and has been absolutely outstanding so the injury has come at a bad time			1
@entity3 players gather around @entity0 as he lies on the ground and receives treatment @entity3 midfielder @entity71 insists the @entity91 will still progress in @entity92 despite @entity0 's absence @entity3 's @entity73 gives his side the lead from the penalty spot as the champions go 1 - 0 up @entity73 makes no mistake as he converts his penalty to give @entity3 the lead @entity11 goalkeeper @entity101 dives the right way but is unable to save @entity73 's penalty @entity105 ’s booking against @entity11 makes him joint top with @entity107 and @entity108 on the all - time list of @entity16 yellow cards with 99			1
@entity71 was the fifth most - appreciated player in the @entity16 on the new @entity112 app this weekend - voted for exclusively be fans			1
' @entity0 is very , very difficult to replace but we have a lot of firepower			2
with the players we do have up there i ’m not too worried			0
‘ @entity59 coming back is a positive and he ’s a fantastic goalscorer			0
@entity120 should be available ( for @entity20 ) as well			2
we have a fantastic squad of players			0
’ @entity3 ’s task in @entity124 will not be easy			2
@entity73 is suspended and @entity125 is a major doubt			0
@entity127 is back in training and @entity3 are more optimistic that he can return after missing eight games with a knee injury			1
@entity131 slides in for a crunching tackle on @entity133 during the match on saturday @entity58 and @entity135 face late fitness tests			2
after @entity0 ’s hat - trick heroics against @entity138 last month revived their @entity19 hopes , @entity3 must get at least a draw in the @entity140 to have a chance of reaching the last 16			1
@entity71 added : ‘ we will go there to win			2
it wo n’t be easy - @entity20 are a good team and i ’m sure it will be a great atmosphere			1
‘ i ’ve played in @entity145 before with @entity3 and @entity146 and you get a hostile atmosphere			2
you look at the experience we have in this squad , and that sort of atmosphere wo n’t bother anybody			0
‘ personally , i love it when you hear the boos and whistles			0
it makes you raise your game			0
in previous seasons we have proved that , when we know what we have to do to win - like we did with our two league titles - we can do it			0
it could be a great @entity92 tie			0
’ @entity11 boss @entity165 was furious after @entity166 received his second caution for diving in two weeks			2
he felt that @entity170 ’s tackle on the young midfielder was no different to @entity172 ’s clash with @entity71 which resulted in the penalty			1
‘ i could n’t believe the yellow card , ’ said the @entity11 manager			0
‘ the penalty was two bodies coming together and then you see the same action , but because @entity166 is involved he gets a yellow card			0
it ’s so inconsistent and disappointing			0
’ @entity166 ( centre ) appears to be pushed to the ground by @entity3 's @entity170 @entity11 boss @entity165 was livid his side were not awarded a penalty for the incident			1
