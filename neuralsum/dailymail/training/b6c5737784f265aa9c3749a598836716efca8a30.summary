by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:36 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 24 april 2013 the @entity2 is making a comeback almost 20 years after it disappeared from the high street			1
@entity5 – which merged with @entity2 in 1995 – plans to launch the branches in the summer after the co-op pulled the plug on a £ 750million deal to buy 632 of its banks			1
the co-op yesterday said its change of heart was based on the ‘ worsened outlook for economic growth ’			1
pain : @entity5 was being forced to sell the branches because it received a 2008 bailout from the @entity17 and after its co-op deal collapsed it is turning to the tsb brand but @entity5 insisted its exit from the deal will not affect the 4.6million branch customers of @entity5 and @entity23 , which is part of the same group , who will now switch to @entity2			1
coming back : the 636 branches up for sale are to be re-branded under the tsb symbol last used in 1995 this will give the new @entity32 ’s eighth largest network of bank branches			0
the @entity34 had ordered @entity5 to get rid of the branches by the end of this year as a condition of receiving a £ 20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008			1
now that the co-op deal has fallen through , @entity5 intends to float the revamped tsb brand on the @entity42			1
but this is unlikely to happen until next year at the earliest , so bosses will have to appeal to the @entity34 to extend the deadline for offloading the branches			0
in the meantime , insiders concede that @entity2 will effectively be an offshoot of @entity5 , with @entity5 current accounts , savings , mortgages and investments and staff , although chequebooks and credit cards will be branded with the tsb logo			1
once tsb is floated , it will stand alone and compete with @entity57 and other lenders			0
@entity5 , which is 39 per cent owned by the taxpayer , has seen its reputation plummet after being rescued by taxpayers during the financial crisis and setting aside £ 6.7billion to pay customers mis - sold payment protection insurance			1
experts welcomed the relaunch of tsb but expressed dismay at the collapse of the co-op deal			1
there were also concerns that tsb would only really be a mini-lloyds until its flotation			0
ministers had hoped the co-op ’s purchase of the branches would create a big , independent competitor to the main high street banks			1
deal dead : @entity80 's sale of more than 600 branches to the @entity82 has collapsed business secretary @entity83 said : ‘ it is very disappointing			2
i was really hoping this would happen			0
we need more competition and we need more diversity in business lending , and having the co-op , a mutual , a new player in small business lending , would have been a big step forward			2
’ @entity94 said yesterday its first - quarter profit fell a quarter from a year ago after a rise in losses in its @entity99 business and a hefty bill for the cost of a restructuring plan by its new chief executive			0
the @entity105 - based giant reported an adjusted pre-tax profit for the three months ended march of £ 1.79bn down from 2.4bn			1
it had hoped to make slightly more - £ 1.85bn			2
profits were dented by a £ 514m charge to cover costs associated with ' @entity111 ' , ceo @entity113 ' plan to axe 3,700 jobs , prune the investment bank and reform the bank 's culture after a series of scandals			2
mr @entity113 said yesterday the bank was making good early progress with its overhaul			2
' in our goal to become the ' @entity126 ' bank we have not chosen an easy path for @entity94 , but we have chosen the right one , ' he said			0
consumer campaigner @entity129 , executive director of which ? , said : ‘ this is very bad news for everyone wanting to see more competition in retail banking			0
‘ this would have given more choice to consumers who are sick and tired of shoddy service and unfair fees and put more pressure on the big banks to work for customers , not bankers			0
’ @entity2 grew from humble beginnings to become a major player on the high street , famous for its slogan , ‘ the bank that likes to say yes ’			1
the first trustee savings bank was established in 1810 by reverend @entity150 , of @entity151 in @entity152 , so his poorest parishioners could save for times of hardship			0
the model was soon copied elsewhere and by 1817 more than 80 had been set up across the @entity157			0
unlike other banks , their customers included labourers and servants – termed the ‘ industrious poor ’ – as well as women and children			0
after being amalgamated into regional institutions , they united in 1986 , floating on the stock exchange to form tsb			0
the new tsb will be run by @entity168 , a former competitive swimmer who joined @entity5 in 2010 .			2
