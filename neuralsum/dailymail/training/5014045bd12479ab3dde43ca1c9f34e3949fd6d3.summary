@entity11 , 60 , threw out a life - buoy in an attempt to rescue his 27 - year - old son @entity14 , who had fallen from rocks into the water after being hit by a wave			1
but then another wave dragged the older man into the sea , too			1
the pair struggled against the current for about half an hour , being ‘ tumbled around like a washing machine ’ , as a rescuer described it			0
when help arrived , it was too late for @entity11			2
the younger man was told to let go of his father , who was face down in the water , and swim to the rescue boat to save himself			1
yesterday relatives paid tribute to mr @entity2 , who had been fishing with his son at @entity36 beach , near @entity37 in north @entity38 , on sunday morning			1
@entity40 volunteer @entity39 , 31 , from @entity41 , @entity38 , was one of three crewmen called out to rescue the pair			1
he said they arrived only just in time to save @entity2			0
‘ it was a high spring tide and the water was going right up to the rocks , ’ he said			0
‘ we saw both the father and son close to the cliff			1
their bodies were being tumbled around like a washing machine , hitting them into the rocks			0
rocky and desolate : the pair were swept out to sea at the difficult - to - reach @entity62 beach in @entity38 ‘ the son was holding his father and both were in a life - buoy			1
the father was face down in the water			2
i told the son he would have to let go of his dad and swim towards us			1
he did not want to do it – but i told him he would die if he did n’t			0
‘ he had bravely held on to his dad until we got there – but then had to make the hard decision to let go of him and swim to us			1
’ he continued : ‘ just as he got to the boat , he went limp			0
i think another 30 seconds in the water and he may have died			1
he had taken on a hell of a lot of water and had cuts on his arms where he had been slammed into the rocks			0
it was very clear to us that when we got him on the boat it was literally just in time , but definitely without his dad ’s actions the son would n’t be with us either			1
’ it is understood that before mr @entity2 swam to the boat , he attached a line of rope to his father ’s body and was able to bring the other end of it on board			2
the village of @entity37 , near the tragic scene : the two men were fishing on rocks on sunday when the son , aged 27 , was engulfed in the wave the crew then towed @entity11 to water away from the rocks where they were able to pull in his body			1
it is believed he was already dead at this stage			2
his son was kept in hospital overnight and discharged the next day			2
locals claimed that the secluded @entity36 beach , which can only be reached by clambering across cliffs , had a history of drownings			0
volunteer @entity40 lifeguard @entity39 , 31 , helped drag the @entity124 out of the sea @entity126 , 70 , who grew up in the area and lives two miles from the beach , said : ‘ the tide washes right up to the rocks and the beach is covered completely by water			2
‘ several people have been caught on the rocks in the past			0
there is no lifeguard and , without a phone , it would take at least half an hour to get to the nearest house			0
’ distant relative , @entity141 , 43 , from @entity37 , said : ' @entity14 is very upset , but i do n't think he is critical anymore			0
' my mother - in - law rang me late morning yesterday			1
i know the pair of them went fishing at 6am yesterday morning			2
' i then got a phone call late morning , early afternoon to say that @entity4 had died and @entity14 had been taken critically ill. ' it 's awful what 's happened			1
it 's not a beach we go to very much			0
my husband is a fisherman and it 's not somewhere he goes to			0
' he probably has n't been there half a dozen times in all his years he 's been fishing			0
' there are n't very many coast guards down there - really we 're just thankful that there was people walking past to raise the alarm because it could have been worse			2
' @entity165 , 40 , from @entity37 , released a tribute on social networking site @entity168			0

' @entity62 is a secluded tidal beach in north @entity38 known for its powerful waves popular with surfers			1
last night , locals claimed it had a history of drownings as there are no lifeguards and the beach can only be accessed by clambering down rocks			0
at high tide the sea comes right up to the cliffs - which can catch some beachgoers unawares			2
the beach is popular with locals because it is hidden away from tourists and offers stunning natural beauty			0
a tourist website advertising accommodation in the area reads : ' here there are crashing breakers , wild flowers , sea birds and vast , open skies			2
' walk down to the tidal beach and make footprints in its two miles of golden sand , explore the rock pools or surf the waves if you dare			0

both father and son were swept off to sea by giant waves off the coast of @entity38 on sunday morning
' sadly we were seconds too late ' : *lifeboat* crews found son holding on to dead father in the ocean
son was ' 30 seconds away from drowning '
he had to be forced to *agonisingly* let go of his dying dad to swim to safety
