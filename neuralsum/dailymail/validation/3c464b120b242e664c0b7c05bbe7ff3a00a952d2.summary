if the thought of running on a treadmill makes you shudder , then you may soon have an excuse to avoid it altogether			0
@entity5 researchers claim they have found a hormone that mimics the effects of exercise , allowing people to lose weight and regulate their blood sugar			2
the hormone , dubbed @entity12 - c , has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years			1

the hormone , dubbed @entity12 - c , has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years the discovery of @entity12 - c - a molecule that acts as a signal for the body - was made by scientists at the @entity26			1
@entity12 - c works by increasing insulin sensitivity , allowing the body to more effectively process glucose sugars , researchers claim			1
insulin is a hormone that moves the sugars from food into the blood stream			0
resistance to insulin can be triggered by a poor diet and may lead to type 2 diabetes			0
the hormone mainly targets muscle tissue , where it restores insulin sensitivity , counteracting diet - induced and age - dependent insulin resistance			1
the hormone may give people yet another excuse to avoid the gym			0
but researchers say its real benefits are in tackling age - related diseases , such as diabetes ' this represents a major advance in the identification of new treatments for age - related diseases such as diabetes , ' said @entity58 , a researcher at the @entity26			1

to test the effects of @entity12 - c , the team injected the hormone into mice fed a high - fat diet , which typically causes them to grow obese and develop a resistance to insulin			2
the injections not only suppressed both effects in mice , they also reversed age - dependent insulin - resistance , a condition that precedes diabetes			2
' this discovery sheds new light on mitochondria and positions them as active regulators of metabolism , ' said @entity92 , assistant professor at @entity93 and lead author of the study			0
@entity12 - c is unique among hormones in that it is encoded in the dna of mitochondria - the ' powerhouses ' of cells that convert food into energy			2
other hormones are encoded in @entity98 in the nucleus			0
while all of the experiments on mots - c to date have been performed on lab mice , the molecular mechanisms that make it work in mice exist in all mammals , including humans			0
the @entity12 - c intellectual property has been licensed to a biotechnology company , and clinical trials in humans could begin within the next three years , researchers said .			1

the @entity12 - c hormone has so far been proven to work in mice
clinical trials on humans could begin in three years , scientists say
it works by increasing insulin sensitivity which helps regulate blood sugar
it could lead to a pill that will tackle age - related diseases such as diabetes
