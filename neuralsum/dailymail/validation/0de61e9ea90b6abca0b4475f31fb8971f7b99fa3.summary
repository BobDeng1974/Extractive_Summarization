the @entity0 is famous for her love of @entity3 handbags while the @entity4 and the @entity5 rarely ever carry bags at all			0
one royal who has no such qualms about hand luggage is @entity11 's @entity0 @entity10 who arrived to chair a charity meeting cheerfully toting a black leather number by one of her favourite brands , @entity18			1
the 42 - year - old was chairing the annual committee meeting of the @entity11 arm of @entity22 - an event that she has attended nearly every year since marrying @entity24			1
hard at work : @entity11 's @entity0 @entity10 was all business as she chaired a @entity22 meeting today serious though the business at hand was , @entity10 's choice of ensemble proved a treat for fashion fans with the @entity11 queen combining a neat bouclé with a silk shirt and tailored trousers			1
rounding it off was a chic tote by @entity18 and one of her trademark pairs of spike - heeled court shoes			2
@entity10 , who attended the meeting with the @entity11 secretary of state for welfare and @entity45 , @entity46 , is @entity22 @entity11 's honorary president and has long championed charitable causes			1
as well as her work with @entity22 , the royal is president of the @entity50 , which works to make life easier for the physically and mentally handicapped in @entity11 , and is patron of a slew of culture and media charities			1
the latter comes as no surprise given @entity10 's own journalistic roots , with the 42 - year - old enjoying a lengthy career in tv and newspapers before marrying @entity24 in 2004			1
after a stint at @entity65 daily paper , @entity66 , she went on to work for @entity67 , a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in @entity11			2
glamorous : the royal opted for a businesslike ensemble comprised of a boucle jacket and silk shirt important : the @entity11 queen has been involved with @entity22 since marrying @entity24 in 2004 @entity74 came a spell at @entity11 news agency @entity76 before a move to @entity78 in @entity79 saw her take on a role on local paper , @entity83 21			1
back in @entity11 a year later , she worked for the @entity11 version of @entity86 , a news channel and agency specialising in economics , before moving to @entity89 +			2
by the time she met her husband - to - be , @entity10 was working for popular tv channel @entity93 , where along with anchoring the popular @entity95 evening news bulletin , she reported on a wide range of breaking news events , among the 9/11 attacks			0
perhaps as a result of her reporting background , @entity10 is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in @entity102 and regularly turns out for media awards ceremonies			0
by contrast , prince @entity104 is notoriously mistrustful of the media and once quipped to the matron of a @entity109 hospital he was visiting : ' you have mosquitoes			0
i have the press ! ' queen of journalists : @entity10 is also patron of several media charities and regularly attends writing awards predecessor : @entity10 's mother - in - law @entity120 preceded her in the honorary president role when asked by @entity123 journalist @entity122 whether he read the paper during a @entity126 reception , an affronted prince @entity104 allegedly replied : ' no fear ! ' others to complain about the @entity114 include prince @entity129 and the @entity130 and @entity5 - all of whom have run into difficulty with the media			2
prince @entity135 , who last year threatened a pair of photographers with legal action after they were spotted taking photos of @entity140 , is fiercely protective of his - and his wife 's - privacy			0
although the @entity147 media has agreed to follow guidelines laid out in the @entity149 , foreign newspapers have printed a slew of controversial images , among them one taken as a gust of wind blew the duchess of @entity154 's skirt up in @entity155			0
most notorious of all was an incident in which a @entity158 paparazzi photographer took photos of a sunbathing @entity5 as she relaxed outside a secluded farmhouse from a road a mile away using a long lens			0
the resulting pictures , which were then published by the @entity158 version of @entity165 in september 2012 , left prince @entity135 furious and he later took legal action against the offending photographer for invasion of privacy .			0
