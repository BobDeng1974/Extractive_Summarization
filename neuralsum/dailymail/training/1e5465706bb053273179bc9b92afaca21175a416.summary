by @entity0 last updated at 1:34 pm on 24th october 2011 @entity2 's fiery president @entity1 has scored a record election win after her government spread the wealth of a booming economy			1
ms @entity1 won 53 per cent of the vote after 58 per cent of the polling stations reported nationwide			1

it was the widest margin of victory in the country 's history			1
re-elected : @entity1 waves to supporters at her victory rally in @entity17 interior minister @entity18 predicted the president 's share would rise as polls reported from her party 's stronghold of densely populated @entity24			1
' count on me to continue pursuing the project , ' ms @entity1 vowed in her victory speech			1
' all i want is to keep collaborating ... to keep @entity2 growing			1
i want to keep changing history			1
' ms @entity1 is @entity30 's first woman to be re-elected as president , but the victory was personally bitter sweet - the first without her husband and predecessor , @entity35 , who died of a heart attack last october 27			1
' this is a strange night for me , ' she said , describing her mix of emotions			1
' this man who transformed @entity2 led us all and gave everything he had and more ... without him , without his valour and courage , it would have been impossible to get to this point			1
' thousands of jubilant , flag - waving people crowded into the capital 's historic @entity48 to watch on a huge tv screen as ms @entity1 spoke from a hotel			1
president @entity52 delivers a speech after winning a second four - year term by a huge margin over her closest rival , according to partial results emotional : president @entity52 is greeted by her son @entity58 next to her daughter @entity60 her supporters interrupted so frequently with their chants that she lectured them as a mother would her children : ' the worst that people can be is small			1
in history , you always must be bigger still - more generous , more thoughtful , more thankful			2
' then , she showed her teeth , vowing to protect @entity2 from outside threats or special interests			2
' this woman is n't moved by any interest			2
the only thing that moves her is profound love for the country			2
of that i 'm responsible , ' ms @entity1 said			2
@entity1 has made no secret of her contempt for @entity83 's presence in the @entity84			2
in june , she called @entity83 a ' crude colonial power ' after @entity86 declared the @entity84 should remain @entity83 territory			2
president @entity52 had taken issue with remarks made by mr @entity86 at @entity91 's questions			2
the leader had praised the @entity83 troops who retook the @entity84 from the @entity2 during the 1982 war over the islands			0
but ms @entity1 insisted @entity2 and @entity83 should negotiate over the islands , as the @entity96 has urged			0
she said @entity2 intends to keep raising its demands in international forums for negotiations with the @entity83			0
' we 're going to say that in the 21st century they continue to be a crude colonial power in decline , ' she said			0
referring to mr @entity86 's statements , ms @entity1 said that @entity2 's foreign minister considered it an ' expression of arrogance			0
' the @entity109 islands are claimed by @entity2 , which refers to them as @entity84			0
later , she appeared in the plaza as well , giving a rousing , second victory speech , her amplified voice echoing through the capital as she called on @entity2 's youth to dedicate themselves to social projects nationwide			0
ms @entity1 was on track to win a larger share of votes than any president since @entity2 's democracy was restored in 1983 , when @entity124 was elected with 52 per cent			0
her margin over governor @entity126 and five other candidates was wider even than the 1973 victory margin of her strongman hero , @entity129			0
her political coalition also hoped to regain enough seats in @entity132 to form new alliances and regain the control it lost in 2009			0
at play were 130 seats in the lower house and 24 in the @entity139			0
ms @entity1 suffered high negative ratings early in her presidency , but soared in popularity as a widow by softening her usually combative tone and proving her ability to command loyalty or respect from an unruly political elite			0
most voters polled beforehand said they wanted government stability to keep their financial situations improving in what has been one of @entity2 's longest spells of economic growth in history			0
ms @entity1 , 58 , chose her youthful , guitar - playing , long - haired economy minister , @entity157 , as her running mate			1
together , the pair championed @entity2 's approach to the global financial crisis : nationalise private pensions and use central bank reserves to increase government spending rather than impose austerity measures , and force investors in foreign debt to suffer before ordinary citizens			1
@entity2 's world - record debt default in 2001 closed off most international lending , but it has kept the country booming ever since , with its economy expanding at twice the rate of @entity175 's , economist @entity169 said			1
fernandez with her son @entity176 , waves to thousands of supporters popular : supporters celebrate after @entity52 won the presidential election at the @entity48 square in @entity17 flying the flag : crowds gather to show their support for their re-elected president the country faces tough challenges in 2012 : its commodities exports are vulnerable to a global recession , and economic growth is forecast to slow sharply in the coming year			0
declining revenues will make it harder to raise incomes to keep up with inflation			0
@entity2 's central bank is under pressure to spend reserves to maintain the peso 's value against the dollar , while also guarding against currency shocks that could threaten @entity2 's all - important trade with @entity175			1
victory : @entity52 speaks to supporters after winning the general election mr @entity157 , 48 , could now win attention as a potential successor to ms @entity1 , but navigating these storms will require much skill and good fortune			0
opposition candidates blamed @entity52 for rising inflation and increasing crime and accused her of politically manipulating economic data and trying to use government power to quell media criticism			0
former president @entity218 , who fell from front - running rival to near - last in the polls , said in a dour closing speech that ' the country is dancing on the @entity223 ' , failing to prepare @entity2 for another global economic crisis .			0

economy growing twice as fast as @entity175
