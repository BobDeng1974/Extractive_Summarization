prince @entity0 is considering adding to his already impressive property portfolio he is renowned for his fearless passion for preserving historic property for the nation			1
and with the keys to nearly a thousand bedrooms and more than 250 bathrooms – not to mention acres of gardens , forest and moorland – you might think prince @entity0 had quite enough property on his plate			1
but now he is planning to acquire more – he is considering buying the 123 - room , 16th century port @entity14 in @entity15 from the eccentric @entity16 for a reported £ 10 million			0
@entity0 ’s official residences are @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
however , his property empire includes two ancient farmhouses in @entity24 – where his neighbours include wolves , lynxes and brown bears ; more than 25 holiday cottages in the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity15 ; the 23,000 - seat @entity33 cricket ground in @entity34 and half of @entity36 , including its prison			1
and that , it seems , is just the tip of the iceberg			0
of course , the properties do not technically belong to @entity0 , being owned by either the @entity43 , one of his charitable foundations , or the @entity46 which has properties worth £ 763 million spread across 131,000 acres and 23 counties			1
but it does provide the @entity0 with a ‘ salary ’ which rose to a record £ 19 million last year			2
it ’s also seen as something of a trust fund for @entity56 , though @entity0 has voluntarily paid tax on the @entity59 income – £ 3.4 million in 2013 – for the past 20 years			2
his property buying has at times raised eyebrows			0
while he has made canny conservation purchases , he has also spent wildly – such as when he urged his charitable foundation to borrow £ 20 million to help secure 18th century @entity65 after a deal to sell the 2,000 - acre property to the @entity68 fell through			0
@entity0 heard about the dilemma at a dinner at @entity71 and was so dismayed at the thought of the house and its @entity75 furniture going under the hammer after a local charity failed to raise more than half the purchase price that he offered to ‘ make up the difference ’			1
though he had never visited the property			0
financiers warned it could prove a ‘ financial banana skin ’			0
but the loan has since been paid off and the @entity0 seems ready for more deals			2
here we offer a glimpse into his extraordinary property empire .			0
