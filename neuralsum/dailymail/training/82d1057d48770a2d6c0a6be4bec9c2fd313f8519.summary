by @entity0 published : 03:06 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 8 august 2013 they were the tortured souls incarcerated in the world ’s first mental asylum			2
the uproar , chaos and barbarism that surrounded them gave the place its famous nickname , which has resonated for centuries as a byword for madness – @entity13			1
now the ‘ lost souls of @entity13 ’ are giving up their dark secrets , yards from one of @entity18 ’s busiest railway stations			1
it is thought the works , for the £ 15billion @entity42 project , will eventually yield up to 4,000 bodies , some dating back 450 years			1
the graveyard , built on the @entity13 ’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the city started to overflow , was used to bury @entity18 ’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum			1
extraordinary : archaeologist @entity54 at @entity25 uncovering the burial ground graveyard : an archaeologist digs up skeletons from a burial ground near @entity25 station discovery : the cemetery is named after the @entity13 and holds many of its patients @entity13 , whose name quickly became pronounced ‘ @entity13 ’ by @entity67 , was founded in 1247 by @entity68 , a wealthy former sheriff of london , as a priory dedicated to @entity71 of @entity13			1
by 1403 , the majority of its patients were lunatics			2
others suffered from epilepsy , learning disabilities and dementia			0
inside the squalid single - storey building that housed 12 cells , a kitchen , staff accommodation and an exercise yard , inmates were manacled and chained – and treated as a tourist attraction by @entity67 who paid a penny to stare at them			2
patients , usually poor , were given treatments including restraint , dousing with water , beatings and isolation			1
works : the graveyard has come to light during the excavation of a tunnel under @entity18 for @entity42 trains conditions inside @entity13 were depicted by @entity101 in his 18th century drawings a @entity103 , charting the decline of a merchant ’s son from wealthy heir to asylum inmate , via debtor ’s jail			1
in 1676 , the asylum moved to nearby @entity112 , then in 1815 to @entity113			2
now the @entity13 , it has been in @entity115 , @entity116 , since 1930 and is part of the @entity18 and @entity118			1
at the @entity42 site , it will not be possible to distinguish @entity13 patients from other dead , as mental illness will not have left any physical scars on the skeletons			1
in most cases , identification will be difficult , if not impossible , because although some were buried in coffins , any name plates recovered have been too rusty to read			0
the dig ’s manager , @entity131 from the @entity133 , is part of a team of more than 100 archaeologists who are examining each of the 40 sites being dug up for @entity42 , the 73 - mile rail line that will link the @entity139 , @entity140 , the @entity141 and @entity142 to commuter areas east and west of @entity18			1
major operation : more than 100 archaeologists have worked on the @entity42 excavations over four years anonymous : the identity of most of the bodies will never be discovered because of a lack of burial records overflow : the graveyard was established in the 16th century as the cemeteries of parish churches were filling up investigation : 4,000 skeletons will be disinterred and studied before being reburied elsewhere back in time : archaeologist @entity158 holding flint as he and his team have been uncovering layers of @entity18 's history including the a ' tool - making factory ' including 150 pieces of flint from the @entity166 @entity167 : this brass sestertius coin from the site dates back to 30 ad and bears the image of @entity172 mr @entity131 said : ‘ this site is a rare , perhaps unprecedented , opportunity			1
this is a major roadway outside one of @entity18 ’s busiest railway stations			0
you do n’t get to dig that up normally			0
everyone ’s been running around @entity25 for years not thinking they are walking around on bodies from one of the densest burial grounds in @entity18			2
’ the bones , some from children , will be examined for clues as to how their owners lived and died			0
there is already evidence that some suffered from rickets			0
it is thought other bones will bear the scars of late - stage syphilis			0
valuable : a 16th - century @entity197 gold coin with a hole enabling it to be worn around the neck shiny : a gold sequin , @entity201 dated 1501 - 1521ad , discovered at the @entity25 site amazing : lead archeologist @entity204 holding a 16th century gold coin found at the @entity25 site ancient : @entity167 horse shoes ( left ) found at @entity25			1
archeologist @entity208 is also pictured ( right ) at work at the @entity166 tool - making factory uncovered : archeologist @entity212 working on the roman road discovered at the @entity25 site digging : archeologist @entity214 is pictured hard at work at the @entity217 site in central @entity18 learning : an archaeologist from the @entity133 next to a map of the site being excavated location : the cemetery is located next to @entity25 , near the original site of the hospital other finds at @entity25 include the project ’s first piece of gold – a 16th century @entity197 coin			1
it had been pierced , so it is likely to have been worn as a pendant			0
the site also holds earlier secrets			0
some 11ft below the skeletons lie the remains of a roman road studded with 2,000 - year - old horseshoes – hoof - shaped ‘ sandals ’ made of metal and secured by leather strapping			1
roman coins have also been found , one from around @entity244 depicting the emperor hadrian			1
@entity246 , editor of @entity247 , said : ‘ what ’s wonderful about this graveyard is that you are looking at a cross-section of society			0
‘ historical records will be from the more educated and better off sections , but this is something that tells us how everyday people lived their lives			0
that kind of glimpse into the past is invaluable			0
’ @entity13 : the scene inside the hospital as depicted by @entity101 in @entity265 the @entity13 was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in @entity38 , having been founded as a priory in 1247 and converted into a hospital in the early 14th century			2
it was founded by @entity270 , who had been elected @entity271 , and was originally located just outside the @entity273 wall , on the site of what is now @entity25			2
due to the hospital 's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane , a bastardised version of its name - ' bedlam ' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally			0
although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly , most were free to walk around the grounds , and conditions were not much worse than the average home of the period			0
in 1674 , the hospital 's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to @entity112 , with the area 's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises			0
@entity13 moved against in 1815 , to @entity297 in @entity113 , which is now the site of the @entity299			2
a final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of @entity303 - it is now run by the @entity305 and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital .			0
