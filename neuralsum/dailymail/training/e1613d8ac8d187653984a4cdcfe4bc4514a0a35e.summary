by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 13 february 2013 for most new parents , bringing their newborn baby home from hospital is a joyous day			1
but for @entity7 , it was clouded with worry			1
diagnosed with cervical cancer when she was six months pregnant , the day marked the start of her long battle with the disease			1
' i started five weeks of radiotherapy on the same day my son @entity17 came out of hospital , ' the mother - of - two told @entity19			1
' so although it was great to have him home , i was terrified at the same time			2
' @entity7 with @entity22 at @entity23 : the family hope an mri scan in march will reveal @entity7 has beaten cervical cancer ms @entity7 and her fiance @entity27 , 27 , had discovered she was pregnant over @entity23 in 2011			1
although she had a four - year - old daughter from a previous relationship , this would be their first child together			2
' we were thrilled as we had n't been trying for long , ' she said			0
' i was quite under the weather for the first few months but i put it down to being pregnant			1
' staying strong : @entity7 when she was 30 weeks pregnant and knew she had cervical cancer			1
she had to wait until she was 32 weeks before she could have @entity17 via c section but at 24 weeks , things started to go horribly wrong			1
' i was just getting ready to go to my daughter @entity41 's ballet show , ' said ms @entity7 , from @entity43 , in @entity44			1
' i was putting on my make up when i felt a trickle down my leg and i realised i was bleeding			2
then i felt contractions starting			0
' i was panicking so much but luckily @entity22 was there and he rushed me straight our local hospital			1
' ms @entity51 was seen at the @entity53 hospital in @entity44 before she was transferred to the @entity54 in @entity55			2
thankfully , her contractions eased and after a few days of being monitored she was allowed home			0
doctors suspected she had a water infection that had threatened to bring on early labour			0
but a few days later she started bleeding again and this time doctors spotted lesions on her cervix			1
' i had had a borderline smear test a month before i got pregnant , ' she said			1
' now they did another smear test and it came back severely abnormal			0
they told us it was probably cervical cancer but to know more they would need to do a biopsy to confirm it			2
' she was 28 weeks pregnant when she received the news she had been dreading			2
' i was in shock			0
i could n't believe i had cancer , ' she said			2
' i was pregnant and i was only 25 at the time			1
i felt like it was happening to somebody else			0
' her doctors advised her to have a @entity79 at 32 weeks , to give her baby and herself their best chances of survival			2
an agonising four weeks of waiting followed			0
' i had such mixed emotions during that time			2
i was trying to get excited about my new baby and was busy getting the room prepared as well as being as normal as possible for my daughter @entity41			2
' yet all the time i knew my cancer could be spreading			1
' doctors planned to perform a @entity79 followed straight afterwards by a hysterectomy where they would attempt to remove any traces of cancer			0
' i remember i saw @entity17 for a second before he was rushed to the neonatal unit , but that 's all , ' she said			0
' when i finally came around i was so relieved because i thought the cancer had gone			1
' but the doctors then told me they had n't performed the hysterectomy as they suspected it had spread to the lymph nodes			1
' @entity7 at 30 weeks pregnant with @entity22 and @entity41 ( left )			1
she had @entity17 ( right ) at 32 weeks but found out the cervical cancer had spread to her lymph nodes bouncing baby boy : @entity17 was born eight weeks premature but has caught up with his peers @entity17 was allowed home after a week in the neonatal unit , which was on the same day that @entity7 started five weeks of radiotherapy			1
she had expressed milk before starting treatment but now struggled to bond with @entity17			0
' i was n't able to hold him for five days and i could n't breastfeed so i did n't feel like he was mine at first , ' she said			0
' it was really hard as some days i barely had the energy to get out of bed			0
my four - year - old daughter was at home for the summer holidays and i could n't take her out places			0
' @entity119 , who plays rugby for the @entity121 , was at home with a knee injury			0
' ms @entity7 also had chemotherapy once a week			1
her treatment triggered an early menopause , which means she wo n't be able to have any further children			0
' it was a very lonely time , ' she said			0
' nobody understood how i felt - some days i just did n't want to be positive like my relatives			0
as a result , she turned to the support offered by @entity134 nurses			0
' i could ring the nurses and they understood			0
' @entity7 was first able to hold @entity17 when he was five days old ( l )			1
he is now seven - months old @entity7 and @entity22 , who are getting married in december , with @entity41 and @entity17			1
in december , an mri revealed cancer her gone from her lymph nodes , although it was visible on her cervix			1
' my body has responded to the treatment but i had hoped to be given the all - clear so we could have a clean slate for 2013			2
but the doctors are hoping the tumour will have gone from my cervix by march , ' she said			0
' i still have my down days and think " why us ? " ' but we 're thankful that we have two wonderful children and we 're looking forward to getting married in december			0
' @entity17 has caught up with other boys his age and he 's a healthy seven - month - old who laughs all the time , so we have to be thankful for that			1
' today @entity154 launched a campaign : you do n't have to face cancer alone			0
