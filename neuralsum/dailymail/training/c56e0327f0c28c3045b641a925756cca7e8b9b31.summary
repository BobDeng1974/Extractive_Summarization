by @entity0 @entity2 holidaymakers seeking to make the most of their money while abroad should point their travel plans in the direction of the @entity7 , according to new figures			1
the exchange rate between sterling and the @entity7 dollar is currently at a five - year high in favour of @entity2 currency – and tourists with an eye for bargains are being urged to cross the @entity18 while the situation holds			1
grab them while you can : the pound is currently trading at a five - year high against the @entity7 dollar while the current rate falls short of the high tide of two dollars to the pound that was available before the financial crisis of 2008 , savvy travellers can now expect to receive $ 1.70 for £ 1 – which will make for great deals in places such as @entity31			1
@entity32 has compiled a list of luxury items which are potentially a little more affordable thanks to the current weakness of the dollar – including high - end jewellery , expensive trainers and computer technology			0
a @entity40 engagement ring , for example , costs from £ 10,300 in the @entity2 , but is available from $ 12,700 in the @entity7 , a price difference which , thanks to the exchange rate , currently equates to a saving of £ 2,823 – 27 per cent less			1
a pair of @entity53 trainers , meanwhile , retail at £ 95 in the sportswear giant ’s @entity49 store , but would cost $ 135 in @entity31 – a drop of £ 39.07 ( 41 per cent )			0
big destinations , big savings : @entity2 travellers can expect more for their money in both @entity31 and @entity59 and an @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , which retails at £ 399 at the @entity62 on @entity49 ’s @entity63 , costs $ 499 at the same shop on @entity65 in the @entity66 – a figure which , when the strength of the pound is considered , translates to a saving of £ 106 ( 26 per cent )			2
‘ the pound has been growing stronger over the past year , meaning that there are deals to be had on travel money , ’ says @entity71 of currency specialists @entity73			0
‘ the current strength of the pound is making holidaying abroad an attractive option , particularly when buying @entity7 dollars			2
’ price - conscious tourists are also being advised that , because the @entity7 dollar is often used as a marker currency , several other destinations have also become far cheaper			1
‘ what @entity2 holidaymakers may not have considered is that there are other currencies promising great exchange rates due to their relationship with the dollar , ’ mr @entity71 adds			0
‘ we are seeing that the spending power of @entity2 holidaymakers and travellers has increased in the countries where the currency is pegged to the @entity7 dollar			1
‘ in fact , their travel money will go 10 per cent further than this time last year			0
beach bargains : because the @entity101 is pegged to its @entity7 counterpart , @entity100 is also cheaper ‘ while now is certainly a great time to visit the @entity7 , it is also a great time to book a trip to the @entity107 or @entity59			2
’ some 21 currencies – including the @entity109 , the @entity101 , the @entity110 and the @entity112 emirati dirham – are all pegged to the @entity7 dollar			2
this means that budget - stretching breaks for @entity2 are currently available from the stylish hotels of @entity116 to the resorts of @entity118 via the sandy beaches of @entity100			0
specifically , eight different countries use the @entity101 – opening up the prospect of extra value for your holiday money if you are currently planning a trip to any of @entity100 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and the @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 .			0
