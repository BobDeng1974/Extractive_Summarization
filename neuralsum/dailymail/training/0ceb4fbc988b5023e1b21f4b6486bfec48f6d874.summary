the @entity80 confirmed in february 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of @entity3 the skeleton of the last of the @entity94 kings was identified by dna analysis after researchers traced his living descendants			1
the scientists concluded it was the remains of the @entity3 who had died in 1485 using a combination of the radiocarbon dating , a comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance , and a comparison of his mitochondrial dna with that of two matrilineal descendants of @entity3 's eldest sister , @entity114			1

' ‘ it is the academic conclusion of the @entity80 that the individual exhumed at @entity89 in august 2012 is indeed @entity3 , the last @entity3 of @entity160			1
’ @entity3 was born in 1452 at @entity161 in @entity162			2

scientists found he had a curved spine and was riddled with roundworm during the @entity167 , @entity3 's father , @entity168 , @entity169 was killed and in 1470 , @entity3 and his brother @entity166 were exiled when @entity170 , from the rival house of @entity172 , took back the throne			1
@entity170 's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year , @entity166 became king			2
in 1483 , @entity166 died and @entity3 was named as protector of the realm for @entity166 's son and successor , the 12 - year - old @entity166 @entity166 and his brother @entity3 were placed in the @entity182 and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king 's marriage to @entity187 , the princes were declared illegitimate			1

@entity3 , depicted by @entity151 as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the @entity182 , died at the @entity199 , defeated by an army led by @entity196			0
according to historical records , his body was taken 15 miles ( 24 kilometres ) to @entity26 where it was displayed as proof of his death before being buried in the @entity231 friary			0
the team from @entity80 set out to trace the site of the old church and its precincts , including the site where @entity3 was finally laid to rest			0
they began excavating the city centre location in august last year and soon discovered the skeleton , which was found in good condition with its feet missing in a grave around 27 inches ( 68 centimetres ) below ground level			2
it was lying in a rough cut grave with the hands crossed in a manner which indicated they were bound when he was buried			0
to the naked eye , it was clear that the remains had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head			0
but archaeologists were keen to make no official announcement until the skeleton had been subjected to months of tests			0
as they were found : the remains of @entity3 were found in a hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in @entity26 last september , in what were once the precincts of @entity231 church the skull of the king as it was found by archaeologists : trauma to the skeleton showed the king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull - possibly caused by a sword and a halberd hunched in death as he was in life : the skeleton was found in good condition with its feet missing the @entity199 : @entity3 , pictured on the white horse , was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at @entity199 , in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the @entity292 speaking at a press conference after the discovery , @entity80 geneticist dr @entity293 described how researchers had traced @entity3 ’s descendants to confirm the body was indeed that of @entity160 ’s last medieval king			1
these were @entity302 born furniture maker @entity300 , a direct descendant of the @entity3 ’s sister @entity114 , and a second person who has asked to remain anonymous			0
dr @entity3 said : ‘ the dna sequence obtained from the @entity231 skeletal remains was compared with the two maternal line relatives of @entity3 ‘ we were very excited to find that there is a dna match between the maternal dna from the family of @entity3 and the skeletal remains we found at the @entity231 dig. ’ the king 's actual remains are due to be sealed in a tomb at @entity318 next year .			1
