having rich parents does n’t just buy an expensive education and exciting holidays abroad			2
it may also purchase more brainpower			2
a study found the children from wealthy families have bigger brains than their poorer counterparts			1
@entity11 researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower			1
their study found that money was important to a young mind			1
parental income was found to be more important than their education			1
shown is a picture of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 brain regions key to academic success were particularly large , the journal @entity25 reports			0
interestingly , the study also revealed that money matters more than parental background when it comes to nourishing the young mind			1
in one of the first studies of its kind , the @entity33 researchers put more than 1,000 healthy children and teenagers through brain scanners and quizzed their parents on their background and income			1
richer people live further away from their parents than those on modest wages , a study in december 2014 claimed			2
the report found workers earning less than £ 25,000 ( $ 37,000 ) live within 31 miles ( 50km ) of their family , but this distance grows the wealthier people become			2
@entity53 who earn £ 35,000 to £ 45,000 ( $ 52,000 to $ 67,000 ) live 42 miles ( 68km ) away while those earning more than £ 55,000 ( $ 81,000 ) live 47 miles ( 76km ) away			0
annuities firm @entity54 said this was because high - earning professionals were more likely to have moved away from where they grew up to secure a lucrative career			0
the study also found people in their 50s live closest to their ageing parents , but later move farther away to be near their own children and grandchildren			1
while people in their 40s lived 37 miles ( 60km ) away , on average , this reduced to 33 miles ( 53km ) as people reached their early 50s			0
the youngsters , who were between three and 20 years old , also did tests of memory and something called executive function			0
this term covers the mental skills that are used to weigh up options , prioritise , multi-task and plan ahead			0
children with poor executive function may struggle to memorise information and be more likely to get into fights			0
analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school			1
however , parental income was even more important			1
brain areas key to language and executive function were bigger in children from wealthier families			0
these youngsters also did better in the mental tests			0
researcher dr @entity96 , of the @entity97 , said : ‘ our data suggest that wider access to resources likely afforded by the more affluent may lead to differences in a child ’s brain structure			0
‘ access to higher - quality childcare , more cognitively stimulating materials in the home and opportunities for learning outside the home likely account for some of these effects			0
’ analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school			2
however , parental income was even more important , perhaps because the children had better living conditions ( stock image shown ) she said that growing up in a household that is free of the stress of struggling to make ends meet is also likely to foster brain development			1
the link between income and brain structure were particularly noticeable among the most deprived children , with small differences in salary having a relatively big effect on the brain			2
it is thought this is because a slight increase in income makes a bigger difference to living conditions to someone on a low wage than to someone who is already well provided for			1
researcher dr @entity143 , of @entity144 in @entity145 , said that despite the clear impact of socio - economic status on the young mind , it would be wrong to think that the changes are fixed			1
she said : ‘ this is the critical point			0
the brain is the product of both genetics and experience and experience is particularly powerful in moulding brain development in childhood			0
‘ this suggests that interventions to improve socioeconomic circumstance , family life and / or educational opportunity can make a vast difference			2

@entity11 researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower
their study found that money was important to a young mind
parental income was found to be more important than their education
this is thought to be *due* to a difference in living conditions
