@entity0 are desperate to offload some of their deadwood in order to revamp their squad on transfer deadline day			2
@entity8 's squad is already two senior players over the @entity11 's 25 - man limit			1
spurs are looking at last - minute deals for @entity13 and @entity15 's defensive midfielder @entity14 , but will have to sell or loan other players			1
11 defenders : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , fryers , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
11 midfielders : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
two strikers : @entity54 and @entity55			0
that ’s 27 senior players			0
@entity58 and @entity59 do n’t take a place in the @entity11 squad as @entity63 players			2
@entity49 could be one of the first out of the door with @entity66 set to secure the playmaker on a season - long loan deal and a permanent £ 6m deal could follow			2
the @entity71 side expect @entity49 at the club for a medical later on monday			0
@entity42 and @entity47 could also be on the way with fellow @entity75 @entity74 - and former @entity0 boss @entity76 - interested in the duo			1
@entity76 is also set to sign young @entity0 left - back @entity78 but he will have to fight off interest from @entity81 too			1
however @entity0 chairman @entity82 is quoting a staggering £ 5m for out of favour left - back			0
@entity82 is playing hardball , even though the former @entity22 trainee has made just seven appearances for @entity0			0
sidelines : @entity49 has become a fringe player at @entity0 , regularly starting matches from the bench going ? @entity42 ( pictured ) and @entity47 were left out of @entity8 's squad for sunday 's game race against time : @entity47 may move after seemingly falling out of @entity8 's plans at @entity0			1

@entity0 are currently two players over the @entity11 25 - player limit
manager @entity8 is looking to offload players for new deals
spurs are looking at @entity13 and @entity15 's @entity14
