try as he might , @entity0 just can not rid himself of @entity1			1
as @entity4 crashed to another one - day defeat , this time by eight wickets with more than 10 overs to spare , @entity0 ’s former team - mate and unfailing bête noire was calling for his resignation on @entity9			1
the worry for @entity0 , as @entity11 moved with embarrassing ease into a 2 - 0 lead in this seven - match series , is that @entity1 was able to do so without sounding bitter			1
‘ @entity15 , ’ he tweeted , ‘ if you care about @entity4 ’s chances this winter , pls resign and just concentrate on test cricket ... # @entity19 ’ @entity1 has called on @entity4 captain to resign from his post for one - day internationals @entity23 , the talented @entity25 opener who has watched both defeats in @entity28 from the pavilion , might not have saved @entity4 as they slumped to a dismal 185			1
but his selection alone might just have lifted a few spirits			0
and @entity4 ’s spirits need lifting — the captain ’s more than anyone ’s			1
since @entity0 led @entity4 to the final of the @entity37 on home soil in 2013 , he has presided over 11 losses in 16 one - day internationals			1
one of his five wins came against @entity42			0
@entity4 ’s lone series victory in that period — earlier this year in the @entity45 — came when @entity46 was in charge			1
and there are a maximum of 10 games left before the @entity51 starts on february 14			0
@entity1 says @entity23 should replace @entity0 as captain of one - day side cook the batsman is faring little better			1
the 22 he made in 37 balls here meant he has now gone 55 innings without a century in both tests and one - day internationals			0
informed of @entity1 ’s observation , he offered a weary grin : ‘ good job i ’m not on social media			1
people are totally entitled to their view			0
that ’s the nature of the beast when you ’re on the outside			0
’ however , this latest defeat also prompted sir @entity73 to call for the captain to be replaced			2
‘ @entity4 do need to make changes and they ’ve got to make them quickly , ’ @entity73 told @entity75			1
‘ personally , i would bring in @entity23 at the top of the order with @entity80 — so that means the captain has to step down			1
‘ i would make ( @entity84 ) @entity83 captain because i think that ’s just what he needs — i think he thinks a bit more out of the box			2
’ @entity4 legend @entity73 called for @entity83 to be made captain it has been a tough few days for the @entity4 captain , who had spent the build - up to this match presiding over a squad still coming to terms with the death of @entity99			1
for a while , the day proceeded in an air of unreality			0
a book of condolences was signed , a minute ’s silence observed , and flags flown at half mast above the @entity109 ’s giant scoreboard			0
perhaps mindful of @entity99 , who died after being hit by a bouncer , the first short ball did not arrive until the 28th over			0
but if the players have felt his death strongly , especially the trio who once counted him as a county colleague — @entity80 , @entity83 and @entity118 — then there should be no mistake : @entity4 wanted to win this game			2
more than that , they needed to			0
instead , they managed only eight boundaries in 43 overs after rain had cut the match to 45 a side			0
only @entity127 and @entity128 passed 22			0
@entity4 ’s bowlers were then effortlessly manoeuvred this way and that by @entity132 and @entity133			2
@entity0 was dismissed by @entity134 as @entity4 went down by eight wickets against @entity11 but it was @entity4 ’s batting that let them down			1
@entity80 , fresh from a sparkling century three days earlier , fell in the second over to the off - breaks of @entity141 , who then persuaded the strokeless @entity0 to slog - sweep to deep square leg			2
in between , @entity145 picked out long - off			0
later , @entity83 added to his own growing catalogue of cheap dismissals			0
@entity128 and @entity127 , with his second half - century of the series , did their best but @entity4 did not look capable of curing all their ills in time for the @entity51			2
as long as @entity4 keep losing and @entity0 keeps failing , there will be only one question in town			1
@entity0 said : ‘ you feel the heat when you ’re not scoring runs			2
how we respond will be really important			0
’ the next game is on wednesday in @entity159			0
for @entity4 and @entity0 , it has already assumed the proportions of a must - win .			1

@entity4 lost by eight wickets against @entity11 on *saturday*
@entity1 has called for @entity0 to resign as captain
there is *confusion* as to why @entity23 has *n't* been picked for the @entity170
