by @entity0 published : 01:57 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 17 november 2013 an @entity2 veteran has been fined $ 5,000 for having trees in front of his house shorter than allowed by his home owner ’s association			1
@entity8 , 51 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , found himself at odds with the @entity12 earlier this year after they cited him for having trees shorter than the minimum required six - foot height for new plantings			1
bad blood on both sides of the dispute has led mr @entity8 to call the @entity12 ‘ idiots ’ and for the association to call the situation ‘ ludicrous			1
’ ' i love these trees ' : @entity8 says he does n't understand how a few smaller trees can have such a big impact on property values ‘ i love these trees , ’ mr @entity8 told @entity29 while standing next to his prized magnolias , which he planted about a year ago			2
the man was fined $ 100 per tree per day until the bill came to $ 5,000 , according to @entity29			0
the trees stand only three - feet - tall , a full three - feet shorter than allowed by the @entity12 , according to the station			1
@entity38 rules require every street to be lined with trees of similar height spaced an equal distance apart from each other			2
' throughout the association there are live oaks and magnolia trees that are 10 to 15 foot height , ' the @entity12 president told @entity50			1
' they 've taken root and are getting pretty big , so they do n't want minor seedlings being planted , ' he added			0
half the required height : mr @entity8 's magnolias are just under three - feet - tall , they need to be six - feet - tall mr @entity8 admitted to @entity58 that he did not entirely read the homeowner ‘ s guidelines when he bought the house			1
‘ i do n't know about you , but i did n't go through every single page , ’ he told @entity50			0
the former soldier the station he planted smaller trees because he believes they will be healthier than taller trees recently planted in other areas of @entity71 that are in poor health			2
‘ mr @entity8 wanted to make a nursery out of an area controlled by the @entity12 and we said no , ’ a spokesperson told @entity29			1
he planted the trees despite being told no , drew huge fines and even spent $ 2,000 on a lawyer to argue his case during a mediation hearing – still , the trees must go			2
up to code : the association requires homeowners to have trees of equal height and spacing lining all streets they must go : mr @entity8 's lawyer worked out a deal requiring him to remove the trees within 20 days to avoid paying the fine ‘ i came back to this country after ( serving in @entity97 ) and it ’s funny i do n’t have the right to plant a tree in front of my house , ’ said the veteran			1
‘ there ’s something wrong there			0
’ the hoa again disagrees			0
‘ this has gotten so carried away it is absolutely ridiculous , ’ the association ’s president told @entity58			0
‘ to me it 's ludicrous			0
’ ‘ we 're not a bunch of idiots			0
‘ we 're just a bunch of neighbors trying to keep property values where they are ,			0
’ this is where mr @entity8 draws his line in the sand			2
‘ i do n’t think they ’re bringing down property value , ’ he told @entity29			0
mr @entity8 's lawyer worked out a deal with the hoa where he has 20 days to remove the trees and avoid the fine , something he will begrudgingly adhere to , he told @entity50 .			1

@entity8 drew the ire of his homeowner 's association after planting two trees shorter than the minimum allowable height
the trees measure about three - feet - tall , the @entity12 requires new trees to be twice that height
he can avoid the fine by removing the trees within 20 days
