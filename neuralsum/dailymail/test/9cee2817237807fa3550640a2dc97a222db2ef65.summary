just like humans learning to talk , puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark			0
at least , that seemed to be the case for one young @entity6 , who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an @entity11 centre			1
the pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion			2
captured on video , the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high - pitched whining sound			0
opening its mouth , the @entity6 then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler ’s arm – whines			1
people standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog			2
the puppy @entity6 and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an @entity11 centre falling quiet for a second , the @entity6 pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond			1
as the dogs continue to converse , the video maker asks with a giggle : ‘ what is that noise ? ’ but it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking , whining and yapping			0
later in the video the excited @entity6 begins running in its owner 's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky			1
passers - by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping , whining and barking at one another and people in the video can be seen laughing while mimicking the dog ’s erratic and entirely humorous actions			0
the video concludes with the husky losing interest slightly and chewing on its handler ’s sleeve			0
before the same handler speaks to the @entity6 and gives it a rub , causing it to momentarily settle down			2
a staff member from the @entity11 centre attempts to pacify the puppy by giving it a rub canine vocalisation usually begins when a puppy is around two - to - three - weeks - old and generally consists of grunts and whines			1
at seven - to - eight - weeks - old , the vocalisation will develop into stronger sounding barks , although some dogs wait as long as 16 weeks before even making an attempt .			0
