police forces are stuck in a time warp , using out - of - date methods to deal with modern offences in substandard investigations , a report claimed yesterday			1
inspectors found that only one in four crimes are being solved by police			1
a watchdog also said victims are routinely let down , as nearly half of the country ’s police are n’t good enough at investigating crime			2
yesterday @entity16 ( @entity16 ) published a 243 - page audit giving forces an @entity20 - style rating for the very first time			1
they were ranked as outstanding , good , requires improvement or inadequate in key performance areas including preventing and investigating crime , providing value for money and operating fairly			0
detectives are failing to carry out house - to - house inquiries , take photos of injuries in domestic abuse cases and collect @entity33 evidence on violent attacks , today 's report revealed the assessment revealed that police are failing to get to grips with cyber crime , child sexual exploitation and crimes against the vulnerable and elderly			1
inspectors were also concerned about the ‘ erosion ’ of officers ’ basic investigative skills in relation to crimes such as burglary and assault			2
a total of 18 out of 43 forces in @entity53 and @entity54 serving 28million people – nearly half of the @entity58 ’s population – need to improve their investigations , the report claimed			0
these include some of our biggest forces , with officers in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 said to lack vital skills and experience			0
in the 18 underperforming forces , detectives sometimes failed to properly gather evidence from @entity33 footage , take fingerprints , identify suspects and support victims			0
there were also problems exposed in the way forces deal with domestic abuse and violent crimes , with detectives not carrying out basic house - to - house inquiries or taking photographs of injuries			1
in other cases , investigation plans had been ‘ cut and pasted ’ from previous jobs			0
the shocking findings come just a week after the @entity16 criticised forces for ‘ indefensible ’ failures in crime recording which see almost a million offences a year disappearing from official figures			2
@entity96 , the chief inspector , said ‘ sluggish ’ police had fallen ‘ behind the curve of rapidly changing criminality ’ because they were not recruiting the right people			1
he added : ‘ the police in too many respects are policing many crimes of today with the methods of yesterday			2
‘ in the past the police recruited 18 - year - old men to deal with burglaries and with street violence			0
‘ the kind of police officer needed today is much more tech - savvy and more sympathetic , with a wider range of skills – and yet today we are seeing the police predominantly policing yesterday ’s crimes with yesterday ’s methods and kit			1
’ home secretary @entity118 ( left ) is under pressure to improve police investigations following today 's report by the chief inspector of constabulary @entity96 ( right ) mr @entity96 said top officers should take the blame for their forces being ‘ insufficiently prepared for the crimes of the future ’			1
and the report went on to warn that as a result of cuts , officer numbers will fall to their lowest for a decade , predicting : ‘ the already thin blue line in our communities is narrowing still further			0
’ @entity135 , chairman of the @entity136 , said : ‘ we have been warning there are issues around what the service can provide against cuts to funding and police numbers			0
‘ although we are pleased that the majority of forces are performing well , we know that officers are struggling to provide the service they believe the public deserve			0
