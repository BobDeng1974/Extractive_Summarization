two heterosexual men have tied the knot on friday morning under @entity3 's liberal marriage laws			1
marrying not for love , but for @entity8 , the two men from @entity5 in the @entity6 of @entity3 officially said ' i do ' in front of 60 family and friends			1
the ceremony was live broadcast by @entity15 , who 's ' @entity18 ' competition was launched earlier this year in a bid to find two straight men willing to wed for the sought after tickets			1
' it 's official folks , @entity24 and @entity25 have just said ' i do ' ! congrats to the happy couple ! , ' the station tweeted			1
@entity29 and @entity30 wed this morning as part of a competition to win tickets to the @entity8 @entity29 , 23 , and @entity34 , 24 , won the ' bromantic ' radio contest in august and are over the moon - not for a life together , but for the opportunity to head to the @entity8 in @entity39 next year			1
while some gay rights groups in @entity3 have voiced objections to the nuptials , the pair are content with their reasons for the wedding			1
@entity29 , an engineer , and @entity30 , a teacher , have known each other for nearly 20 years , and see the wedding as a celebration of their friendship rather than a political statement			0
the newlyweds spoke to @entity53 , taking time out from their wedding reception to walk through their experience			0
' we entered the competition as a way of taking our friendship to the next level , ' said @entity24			2
the men met at the @entity62 in @entity5 when they were six years old , and have been friends ever since			0
' @entity25 called me and asked me to marry him and i said yes without first asking why			0
i knew he 'd have a good reason			0
' the pair wed in front of 60 friends and family in a ' hilarious ' ceremony while some gay rights groups have spoken out against the marriage , they have felt ' love and support ' ' we had to explain it to our families several times , but they 're all quite open minded and we 've been overwhelmed by the love and support we 've experience from our community			1
' a spokesperson from @entity84 explained that as with any event that pushes boundaries , there was bound to be a bit of backlash			0
local gay rights groups have condemned the wedding , protesting that it ' trivializes what we 've fought for , ' according to the @entity93			1
@entity95 co-chairman @entity94 said the competition made clear that men marrying each other was ' something they think is worth having a laugh at			2
' however , @entity30 and @entity29 have explained that their friendship was one of the main motivators in the process , and that it has been strengthened through the trials and challenges which lead them to their big day			0
' we had to be very vulnerable with one another , ' said @entity110 ' through the official proposal and preparing for the wedding we 've spent so much time together , and we 've had to share a lot of intimate details with one another			0
' @entity116 , one of the hosts of @entity84 and a gay man himself , said that he knew that there would be some objection , but as time went by he realised that ' this was a fun event , ' ' it ’s not that i 'm a spokesperson for the gay community , but when you ’re out people do look to you for opinions , ' ' but its been fine and i just relaxed into and took it for what it was			2
i think the gay community has too for the most part , ' the pair will not be living together but are n't sure what the future will bring ' in @entity3 the argument seems to be that if two people want to get married it 's no skin off anyone ’s nose , ' ' so two blokes can have an immense friends and strong bond , and i guess some of them would like to be married , ' ' i think it 's a good thing to celebrate bromance in quirky way , and @entity25 and @entity24 really epitomised that			1
' for @entity25 and @entity24 , the details of the day made it something to look forward to			0
@entity25 and @entity24 all suited up to wed as part of the ' @entity18 ' radio competition ' all of our mates and family came up for the wedding which has been amazing , ' ' we had so much fun with it all			1
we got kitted out in amazing suits and @entity161 walked down the aisle to @entity163 '			0
' the wedding was a very male populated event , with each of the pair having a best man			0
looking to the future , the pair are mainly focused on heading to next year 's @entity8 in @entity39 , saying that they ' bleed black '			1
after a honeymoon on the @entity174 , life will return to normal for the non-traditional newlyweds			2
neither has a girlfriend or partner , which @entity25 says ' makes life easier			0
the wedding wo n't impede on our lives too much , ' ' we 're going to play things by ear			1
while we 're not living together at the moment , we have before , so we 'll see how it 's all going in a year or so			1
' the two friends , who have known each other for almost 20 years , are looking to see what the future holds ' we 're certainly not ready to start a family			0
' the edge 's host @entity192 said that the ceremony was filled with good laughs			2
' they 're such funny guys so the ceremony was hilarious , ' ' everyone took it for what it was , and forgot the whole reason for why they were getting married			2
it was just a celebration of their friendship			0
