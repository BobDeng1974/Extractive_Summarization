@entity0 has paved the way for airstrikes against @entity4 targets in @entity5 after spy planes started operating in the country on his command , according to @entity11 officials			1
while the @entity12 says military action inside @entity5 has not yet been approved , additional intelligence on the militants is considered vital before any move can be made - especially in the northern city of @entity18 , which @entity4 has named the capital of its self - declared caliphate			1
the move comes despite warnings from @entity5 's embattled president @entity23 that any airstrike in the country not given his express permission would be considered an act of aggression			0
@entity0 has so far sought a limited military campaign in neighbouring @entity30 focused on protecting @entity11 diplomats and @entity30 civilians under direct threat from the brutal @entity35 militant group			1
but officials have not ruled out escalating military action against @entity4 , which has increased its overt threats against the @entity11 in recent weeks			1
@entity11 president @entity0 has now paved the way for airstrikes on @entity4 targets difficult decisions : president @entity0 and first lady @entity49 , return to the @entity12 with their daughter @entity50 on sunday after his vacation in @entity52 @entity54 officials have been drafting potential options for the type of action @entity0 may want to consider to counter @entity4			1
the plans include airstrikes against strategic targets			0
one official said the administration has a need for reliable intelligence from @entity5 and called the surveillance flights an important avenue for obtaining data on the group 's size , firepower and the whereabouts of its leadership			1
the @entity11 began launching strikes against @entity4 inside @entity30 earlier this month - with @entity0 citing the threat to @entity11 personnel in the country and a humanitarian crisis in the north as his rationale			1
but top @entity54 officials have said the only way to eliminate the militants - who have been branded too extreme even by notorious terrorist group @entity43 - is to go after the group inside @entity5 as well			0
@entity0 has long resisted taking military action in @entity5 - a step that would plunge the @entity11 into a country already ravaged by an intractable civil war			1
however , the president 's calculus appears to have shifted since @entity4 announced last week that it had murdered @entity90 - an @entity11 photojournalist who had been held hostage in @entity5			2
the extremist group is also threatening to kill other @entity11 citizens in its hands			0
@entity95 : despite admitting @entity5 would welcome outside help in the battle against @entity4 , president @entity23 's regime said it would consider any unauthorized @entity11 airstrike in the country an act of aggression expansion of airstrikes to @entity5 : a @entity107 @entity106 launches off from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier @entity110 in the @entity112 waters on august 15 to strike @entity4 positions in @entity30 @entity12 spokesman @entity114 yesterday said that @entity0 has demonstrated his willingness to order military action whenever it is deemed necessary to protect @entity11 citizens			1
' that is true without regard to international boundaries , ' he added			0
the @entity12 would not comment on @entity0 's decision to authorize surveillance flights over @entity5 yesterday , but a spokesperson speaking on condition of anonymity today said they had begun			2
the @entity11 stepped up its air surveillance of @entity4 inside @entity30 earlier this year as @entity0 began considering the prospect of airstrikes there			1
and the administration has already run some surveillance missions over @entity5 - including ahead of an attempted mission to rescue @entity90 and other @entity11 hostages earlier this summer			2
the @entity11 special forces who were sent into @entity5 to carry out the rescue mission did not find the hostages at the location where the military thought they were being held			2
officials who confirmed the failed rescue last week said the @entity11 was continuing to seek out intelligence on the other hostages ' whereabouts			0
threat : general @entity145 , chairman of the @entity146 , said of @entity4 : ' this is an organization that has an apocalyptic , end - of - days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated ' administration officials have said a concern for @entity0 in seeking to take out @entity4 inside @entity5 is the prospect that such a move could unintentionally help @entity23			2
yesterday a top @entity5 official said any @entity11 airstrike without consent will be considered aggression			0
@entity4 is among the rebel groups seeking @entity23 's ouster - along with other forces aided by the @entity11 the @entity12 yesterday tried to tamp down the notion that action against @entity4 could bolster @entity23 , with @entity114 saying , ' we 're not interested in trying to help the @entity23 regime			0

' ' with @entity168 , [ @entity145 ] is preparing options to address @entity4 both in @entity30 and @entity5 with a variety of military tools including airstrikes , ' colonel @entity167 said			2
' the bottom line is that our forces are well postured to partner with regional allies against @entity4			0
' escalation : @entity11 journalist @entity179 and member of the @entity35 militant group @entity4 speak to the camera before he is brutally executed			0
his death appears to changed @entity0 's stance on military action a @entity11 official said @entity187 was also preparing to launch intelligence and surveillance flights , including drones , over @entity5			1
two other @entity11 officials also acknowledged the preparation of strike options against @entity4 in @entity5 , with one saying planning had been under way for weeks			2
still , neither official suggested @entity11 military action there was imminent			0
' we 're just not there yet , ' said a senior @entity11 defense official , speaking on condition of the anonymity			0
on sunday @entity204 called for more aggressive @entity11 action to defeat @entity4 militants in @entity5 and @entity30 , accusing @entity0 of policies that have failed to thwart potential new threats on @entity11 soil .			1
