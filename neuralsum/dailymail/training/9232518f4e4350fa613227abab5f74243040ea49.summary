tourists have been evacuated from one of the most iconic bridges in @entity3 after it began to crumble under the weight of thousands of ' love locks '			1
a chunk of the @entity9 bridge fell away on sunday night and the police were called to seal off the area which remains closed today			1
it is a popular custom for tourists to secure a padlock to the bridge branded with their names as a romantic gesture , with @entity18 and boyfriend @entity19 also indulging in the tradition			1
but the weight of the locks is damaging the metal @entity43 , which was originally completed in 1804 but rebuilt in the 1980s following damage in the two @entity46			0
a local @entity49 police spokesperson said : ' a metal grille had fallen inwards , rather than into the river			2
' if it had landed on a passing boat , the results could have been disastrous			0
as it happened , nobody was injured			2
' the bridge was evacuated , and will now be closed until monday morning at the earliest			2
' celebrity trend : @entity18 , pictured with @entity19 and son @entity26 , was captured on camera attaching the lock for tv show keeping up with the @entity62 in the family : @entity38 and her mother @entity65 also stopped at @entity9 on a visit to @entity3 to attach a padlock to the bridge vying for space : there are now so many padlocks on the bridge that some tourists have taken to attaching theirs to lampposts too if follows growing calls for the padlocks - which also blight other major @entity78 cities including @entity79 - to be banned			1
it has become common practice for visitors to buy a padlock , attach it to a bridge , and then throw the key into the river , in @entity3 's case the @entity88			1
the practice has been encouraged by @entity91 celebrities including @entity38 and @entity92 , who spent a lot of time dating in @entity3 before their wedding in @entity96 last month			2
the famous @entity3 bridge is said to offer some of the best views along the @entity88 it was first built between 1802 and 1804 , under the reign of @entity101 , and is a favourite with artists due to damage sustained in @entity106 and @entity107 , the bridge was rebuilt between 1981 and 1984 the ' love lock ' tradition began in @entity110 in the early 20th century , based on a tale of a woman who lost her soldier love to another during @entity106			1
young women started symbolising their love by attaching padlocks to the bridge where the abandoned woman used to meet her lost lover			1
the padlock tradition took hold in @entity123 in the early 2000s and was popularised by an @entity96 book i want you by @entity127 , in which a couple adds a padlock to the @entity131 in @entity132			0
in @entity3 , the ritual began in 2008 on the @entity9 but has since extended to the @entity134 near @entity135 too			0
othe bridges encountering problems from a vast quantity of padlocks being affixed are the @entity140 in @entity141 and the @entity142 in @entity143			2
a ' @entity145 ' campaign was launched in @entity3 by two @entity91 in february , in response to some 700,000 padlocks appearing around the city			2
all bridges have been blighted by the practice , but the @entity9 now looks like two solid walls of metal divided by a wooden walkway			0
' it 's so out of control , ' says @entity156 , who co-founded the campaign with fellow writer @entity158			0
' people are climbing up lampposts to clip locks on , hanging over the bridge to put them on the other side of the rail , risking their lives to attach one			0
it 's a kind of mania			0
it 's not about romance any more - it 's just about saying ' i did it			0
' on tour : actor @entity174 has also visited the iconic @entity43 with friends protests : a campaign has been started to stop the practice of fixing locks to the bridge - a problem that blights iconic bridges across @entity123 @entity183 , the @entity184 mayor of @entity3 , has so far resisted calls to take action over the vandalism , but the bridge collapse could change that			1
a spokesman for the @entity191 said : ' if the tradition continues to grow in popularity and causes too much damage to the city 's monuments , solutions will be considered in a bid to address the problem			0
' the pedestrian @entity9 , which links the @entity201 and the @entity202 , is an exact replica of one designed by @entity101 's architects in 1802			0
love locks : @entity38 and @entity92 also attached a padlock to the bridge when they were in @entity3 lookout point : the bridge is famed for its spectacular views along the @entity88 the original was damaged by @entity214 bombs during both world wars , but a faithful reproduction was built during the 1980s			1
it was once considered a hugely romantic bridge , enjoying arguably the prettiest views in the city , but many locals argue the padlocks have turned it into a tourist trap .			1

police said it was lucky nobody was injured by the bridge section that fell
tourists place padlocks on the bridge to seal their love
@entity18 and @entity19 have left padlocks at bridge
locals are calling for the practice to be banned to protect the bridge
