they were all hired through agencies			0

@entity9 , which has cut almost 1,000 workers since 2009 , employed 162 interim staff costing £ 7.2million			1
two of the temps were paid more than £ 900 - a - day			1
@entity44 of the @entity45 said the fees for temps was an ' enormous waste of money ' @entity44 , chief executive of the @entity50 , said : ‘ taxpayers will be shocked that local authorities in the county are spending so much money on interim staff			1
‘ temporary staff may be needed sometimes to fill roles in the short term , but these figures suggest they are being used for far longer than that by local authorities which is an enormous waste of money			1
‘ councils need to explain why these staff were needed or to take action to deliver better value for our money			2
’ the local authorities insisted temporary staff are needed to cover sickness and vacancies in the short - term			2
but @entity75 , @entity76 branch secretary for @entity8 , said : ‘ it is a concern for us that this work has been carried out through temporary staff when it could have been done through normal staff			2
‘ there could have been quite a few jobs that could have been saved if the council had not been expending on these interim posts			0
‘ there is n't really any evidence on the contrary that this benefits the council long term , so why do n't they retain staff instead ? ’ a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ we employ over 1,000 staff , the vast majority of whom are contracted on either fixed term or permanent contracts			0
‘ however it is sometimes necessary to employ a small number of interim staff to fill critical posts that require staffing immediately whilst a recruitment process is undertaken , to fill posts that are hard to recruit to , or to manage planned absences			0
‘ we currently only have four interim positions , and it must be remembered that these posts would still incur a cost to the council if they were covered by contracted staff			0
’ @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are being paid up to £ 800 - a - day , costing £ 8million - a - year both @entity7 and @entity113 said that short - term staff do not get sick pay or paid leave			1
@entity118 ’s @entity117 said : ‘ we use interim managers for a range of purposes across the council but we do try to use them sparingly			0
‘ interims are only commissioned to provide essential specialist advice and support if the council does not have the expertise in - house			0
‘ the council has been working proactively to manage its use of interims and over recent years we have used a very limited number of interim managers , primarily to cover for vacancies in critical posts or where we have gone through significant change			0
’ @entity9 said temps helped with the council 's cost cutting programme			2
@entity140 said : ‘ @entity9 has completed the first part of an ambitious programme of transformation , we have saved £ 360m as a result			2
‘ this has meant we have needed additional professional expertise and capacity in the short term in order to achieve this			0
‘ interim staff can be a cost - effective way of accessing professional expertise in relation to short - term or one - off pieces of work and helps the council complete complex projects for which we have no or insufficient in - house capacity or capability			0
‘ rigorous controls are in place around the recruitment of these staff , who are recruited for short periods of time in the main for less than three months			0
