despite regularly changing their roost , bats will choose to lodge with the same social groups of ‘ friends ’ following each move , claims research			2
by tracking movements of bats in @entity10 woods , researchers discovered that different social groups roost in separate , though adjacent , parts of woodland			1
the findings have important implications for conservation as bats may not be able to move to another area if a section of woodland is felled			1
a study carried out over five years in @entity21 , @entity10 has found that bats like to stick together			1
this image shows a network analysis of how individual bats interact in social groups			0
nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands to make the findings the research was carried out by scientists from the @entity32 , the @entity33 and the @entity34			1
experts concluded that the structure of bat social groups differs between two different , but closely - related , species living in the same woodland			0
bats are pictured roosting together in @entity34 the study was carried out over a five - year period in @entity21 , @entity10			1
nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands , and four bats were tagged with lightweight radio - transmitters			1
the radio tracking showed the bats changed roost site about once every two days			1
each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood			1
although the bat species occupied the same area of woodland , the home patches of the different social groups within the species did not overlap , suggesting that social groups may defend their roost areas			2
one species , called @entity60 ( @entity60 ) forms mixed - sex social groups , while a second species , the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , has largely separate male and female groups			0
dr @entity67 from the @entity32 , who conducted the study , said : ‘ when the first results came through it was a real eureka moment , i had n’t expected to see so many separate social groups in the woodland			0
’ the study was carried out over a five - year period in @entity21 , @entity10			2
nearly 1,500 bats were fitted with small aluminium arm bands , and four bats were tagged with tiny lightweight radio - transmitters to enable them to be tracked			1
the radio tracking showed that the bats changed roost site frequently - about once every two days			1
each social group was found to occupy a home patch in the wood			1
although the two bat species occupied the same area of woodland , the home patches of the different social groups within the species did not overlap , suggesting that social groups may defend their roost areas			0
the relationships between bats in the same social groups were found to be enduring , in many cases lasting more than a year			0
dr @entity94 from the @entity33 who led the research team added : ‘ this work has really important practical implications for bat conservation			0
the research at @entity21 ( shown on map ) was carried out by scientists from the @entity32 , the @entity33 and the @entity34 experts concluded that the structure of bat social groups differs between two different , but closely - related species living in the same woodland			2
one species , called @entity60 ( shown left ) , forms mixed - sex social groups , while a second species , the @entity63 ( right ) , has largely separate male and female groups			0
‘ we now realise that although social groups of woodland bats ‘ move house ’ every few days , they remain within a very small geographical range			2
‘ this means that even quite small - scale tree felling may destroy all the roosts potentially available to a group			0
' the research has highlighted that the social networks of animals are poorly understood , but they are ‘ fundamentally important to processes ranging from information transfer to the spread of disease ’			0
dr @entity137 concluded : ‘ just as some types of people are super-connected on @entity140 , this work shows that in animal systems , two very closely related species living in the same habitat can have very different kinds of social network			0
’ the findings are published in the journal @entity143 .			0
