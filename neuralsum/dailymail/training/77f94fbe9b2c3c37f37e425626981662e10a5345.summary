by @entity0 for @entity1 an 11 - year - old who fought and survived cancer three years ago has made it her mission to help other kids fighting the disease			0
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was just eight when she was diagnosed with @entity11 , a rare bone and soft tissue cancer , and she says the heavy iv pole she had to cart around during chemo sessions made the whole experience harder and scarier			2
so the savvy tween came up with a solution : an iv backpack specially designed to accommodate a pump for chemotherapy or transfusions			1
' it was really scary for me at a young age , which was eight , ' she told @entity43			0
' i had to use the big iv poles which were actually really heavy to push around and they had lots of wires and tubes i would trip over or get tangled in			0
' to combat these setbacks , @entity8 designed a backpack which is fitted with the iv pole on the top corner of the bag			1
a wire protector around the iv sack ensures that it wo n't pop if you lean on it , and the medical machine goes inside the bag			0
instead of the clinical white and metal pole patients normally use , @entity8 's backpack is pink and @entity61 , making it even less threatening to children with cancer			1
and since it straps onto your back , it allows young patients to play and do activities to distract themselves while undergoing chemo			0
kid - friendly : @entity8 's backpack is fitted with the iv pole on the top corner of the bag			1
a wire protector around the iv sack ensures that it wo n't pop if you lean on it , and the medical machine goes inside the bag after 46 weeks of chemotherapy and several surgeries , @entity8 was confirmed cancer - free two years ago , and now she 's focusing on helping others			2
now , thanks to all the attention she has received for her invention , @entity8 hopes to actually get her prototype made so she can provide it to children and hospitals everywhere			2
she is asking for supporters to donate money via her @entity90 page to make her invention a reality			2
so far , she has raised more than $ 46,000 , with an ultimate goal of $ 50,000 to fund the manufacturing of a usable iv backpack			1
ambitious : so far , she has raised more than $ 46,000 via a @entity90 page , with an ultimate goal of $ 50,000 to fund the manufacturing of the first usable iv backpack her school was so impressed by the invention that they even picked it to be presented at the @entity100 , where it won four prizes including the @entity103 - the highest award at the event			1
this means that the backpack has been submitted to the @entity108 to be patented			0
as for the teachers who first gave her the assignment , ' they just flipped ! ' she laughed .			0

the backpack has the pole and iv bag attached to the upper corner so that children can be *mobile* and do activities while receiving chemotherapy
so far , @entity8 has raised more than $ 46,000 via a @entity90 page , with an ultimate goal of $ 50,000 to fund the manufacturing of a usable iv backpack
