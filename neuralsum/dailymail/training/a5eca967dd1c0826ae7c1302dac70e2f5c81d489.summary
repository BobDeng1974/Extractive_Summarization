researchers at @entity1 found that overweight students , especially girls , are less likely to get into university than skinnier students winning a place at the best universities can be difficult enough - and now @entity8 scientists believe how much you weigh could influence whether you are accepted			1
researchers at @entity1 found that overweight students , especially girls , are less likely to get into university than skinnier students			1
the group of psychologists studied almost a thousand applications for postgraduate courses and found that academics favoured thin candidates in face to face interviews			1
however , there was no significant difference in success rates when conversations were carried out over the phone or when credentials were assessed remotely			0
psychologist @entity23 and colleagues at the university asked 97 applicants for psychology graduate programmes at more than 950 universities in the @entity8 whether they had an interview in person or on the phone , and whether or not they received an offer			1
dr @entity23 said : ' when we looked at that we could see a clear relation between their weight and offers of admission for those applicants who had had an in person interview			0
' the success rate for people who had had no interview or a phone interview was pretty much equal , but when in - person interviews were involved , there was quite a bit of difference , even when applicants started out on equal footing with their grades , test scores and letters of recommendation			2
' the study , which was published in the journal @entity57 , also suggested the weight bias was stronger for female applicants			1
the researchers examined letters of recommendation - a common feature in the application process for winning a place at @entity8 universities - and identified positive and negative statements in them as well as the overall quality of the letters			2
dr @entity23 said : ' one of the things we suspected was the quality of their letters of recommendation written by their undergrad mentors would be associated with the applicants ' body weight , but it really was not			0
psychologists studied almost a thousand applications for postgraduate courses and found that academics favoured thin candidates in face to face interviews ' it may be that letter writers come to know students well and body weight no longer played a factor			1
' previous studies by @entity92 researchers have found overweight people , especially women , are less likely to be hired because employers assume they will be lazy , and when they do get a job tend to be bullied , earn less and are often overlooked for promotion			2
in the poll of 200 bosses , a quarter of men said they would turn down a candidate purely on their weight and one in ten admitted they had already done so			0
dr @entity23 admitted his researchers were not surprised by their findings			0
he said : ' we know these kinds of biases are pretty common and even somewhat acceptable compared to other biases and there is not much legally forbidding it			0
' the success rate for people who had had no interview or a phone interview to win a place at a @entity8 university was pretty much equal , but there was a difference between overweight and slimmer candidates who did face - to - face interviews , even when their grades were similar he said additional research is needed into other fields as well as psychology into the issue and the results could reveal an even stronger bias against people with a high body mass index			1
as the study examined the issue in psychology departments at universities , the findings might be particularly shocking			0
dr @entity23 said : ' we might expect psychology faculty to be more aware of these types of biases			0
thus , the level of bias found in this study could be a conservative estimate of the level of bias in the graduate admissions process in other fields			2
