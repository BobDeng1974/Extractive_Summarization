by @entity0 published : 18:29 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 11 april 2013 left - wing @entity1 marred generous tributes from across the political divide last night as they used an extraordinary recall of @entity6 to launch vicious and intemperate attacks on the @entity8			1
a visibly emotional @entity9 said the former prime minister ’s epitaph should be ‘ she made our country great again ’ and @entity16 leader @entity15 called her a ‘ unique and towering figure ’ – while criticising her for closing coal mines , her position on gay rights and other issues			1
there were more than seven hours of debate in the @entity24 – compared with only 45 minutes following the death of sir @entity26 – and five and a half hours in the @entity27			2
@entity45 sparked angry protests from @entity48 benches as she launched into a tirade against the ‘ heinous ’ former prime minister , telling mps she did not consider her a woman			1
‘ the first prime minister of female gender , ok			2
but a woman ? not on my terms , ’ said @entity53			1
her remarks prompted such uproar that the @entity48 mp for @entity60 sir @entity59 attempted to raise a point of order with speaker @entity63 to draw a halt to attacks but was rebuffed			2
away from the @entity27 , former @entity16 prime minister @entity66 had urged critics of @entity69 policies to be respectful			1
‘ even if you disagree with someone very strongly , you can still – particularly at the moment of their passing – you should show some respect , ’ he said			2
no shows : few @entity1 turned up to the seven hours of debate in the commons where representatives from all parties paid tribute to @entity38 leading tributes : both prime minister @entity9 and @entity82 @entity15 paid tribute to @entity38 during the special one - day session disgrace : heartwarming cross-party tributes paid to @entity8 during yesterday 's session in @entity6 were tarnished by outrageous attacks from left - wing politicians in attendance but miss @entity45 , an @entity90 - winning actress who entered the @entity24 in 1992 , claimed @entity38 had taught that vices were virtues			1
‘ greed , selfishness , no care for the weaker			2
@entity96 elbows and sharp knees , this was the way forward , ’ she said			2
‘ people saw the price of everything and the value of nothing			2
there was a heinous social , economic and spiritual damage wreaked upon this country			2
’ former deputy prime minister @entity106 tweeted a link to tv footage of miss @entity45 ’s rant , saying he was ‘ proud to be a fan ’			1
' not a woman ' : mp @entity45 marred the tribute session launching a furious attack on the late @entity38 former labour environment minister @entity114 said @entity38 lacked the ‘ generosity and magnanimity ’ that needed to accompany greatness ‘ if one is to earn a place in the heart of the nation ’			1
veteran mp @entity122 claimed @entity38 had adopted policies that were ‘ highly damaging ... caused immense pain and suffering to ordinary people ’			1
former labour housing minister @entity126 was among mps who stayed away , alleging mr @entity9 had attempted to ‘ hijack ’ @entity38 ’s death for political gain			1
others complained about the costs of recalling @entity6 and the taxpayers ’ contribution to the cost of @entity38 ’s funeral			1
mr @entity9 insisted that it was right to commemorate our first and only woman prime minister , who won three elections in a row and was the 20th century ’s longest - serving @entity142 premier			1
‘ they say “ cometh the hour , cometh the man ”			2
well in 1979 came the hour and came the lady , ’ the prime minister said , his voice cracking with emotion			0
‘ she made the political weather , she made history , and – let this be her epitaph – she made our country great again			0
’ replying for @entity16 , mr @entity15 listed a series of policy areas where he considered ‘ she was right ’ , including the @entity159			1
but areas where he believed she was wrong included on gay and lesbian rights , her position on @entity165 and sanctions against @entity167 and for saying there was ‘ no such thing as society ’			0
‘ i disagreed with much of what she did but i respect what her death means for many , many people who admired her and i honour her personal achievements , ’ he said			2
in a poorly - received speech , @entity179 said : ‘ that those of us who are not from her party can shun the tenets of @entity186 and yet still respect @entity38 is part of what was so remarkable about her			1
’ regrets : @entity190 in the @entity27 yesterday @entity8 ’s friends and foes alike united yesterday to remember a titan of politics whose public reputation for stridency was tempered by private kindness			0
@entity199 ’s party chairman , laid bare the fury of @entity186 at the way the @entity202 ousted her in 1990			1
saying he regretted not returning to her @entity202 after caring for his wife , a victim of the @entity206 bomb , @entity190 concluded : ‘ i left her , i fear , at the mercy of her friends			0
’ @entity210 lamont the former chancellor , revealed she had told him : ‘ you do not have a constructive idea in your head and if you had been in government since 1979 i would have achieved nothing			0
’ ‘ i said : “ well prime minister you are always right about everything but there is one thing you are wrong about – i have been in your government since 1979 ”			0
’ @entity222 the former @entity48 leader , said : ‘ it has been said many times that she was a divisive figure			0
there was no consensus on the right thing to do for our country			0
if she had waited for consensus , nothing would ever have happened			0
she saw what needed to be done and she did it with clarity , courage and conviction			0
’ @entity210 ashdown the former @entity241 leader , recalled visiting @entity242 with his wife , who ‘ hated [ mrs @entity8 ’s ] policies with a passion ’			0
he continued : ‘ the prime minister stopped and talked to us for a few moments and as she moved away , my wife hissed through gritted teeth : “ she ’s absolutely bloody charming , dammit ”			0
’ sir @entity253 @entity16 ’s shadow foreign secretary in the 1980s , said : ‘ unlike @entity26 , @entity255 or @entity256 , she broke the post-war consensus ; that was her objective , and that was her achievement			1
in personal relationships , and in some policy areas , @entity38 could be more than civilized – indeed , punctilious and cordial			1
’ @entity260 who served as a minister throughout @entity38 ’s 11 years in power , said : ‘ it was sometimes said that she did not have a sense of humour ... but i recall on one occasion that she was asked , “ do you believe in consensus ? ” to our surprise , we heard her saying , “ yes , i do believe in consensus : there should be a consensus behind my convictions			1
” i thought at the time that this was an extraordinary example of wit , but as the years have gone by i have realised that she was actually being deadly serious			0
’ @entity283 ’s cabinet secretary , recalled how @entity285 president @entity284 flirted with her at their first meeting			0
‘ i said to her : “ that visit went rather well , did n’t it ? ”			0
she said , “ yes , i suppose it did ”			0
then there was a pause and she said , “ of course he likes women , you know ”			0
the president had been – how shall i put it ? – flattering her femininity throughout the meeting , and she had recognised that and enjoyed every minute of it			0
’ tribute : former @entity48 leader @entity222 honoured @entity38 , saying she did what needed to be done for the country with ' clarity and courage ' @entity307 described his ‘ total amazement ’ at being named in @entity38 ’s first cabinet and his disappointment at being named transport minister			1
“ @entity312 , ” she said , “ i did transport , you can do transport ”			0
’ @entity316 who was @entity38 ’s chief whip in her first term , recalled her personal kindness : ‘ at the first @entity319 for which she was prime minister , she said to me : “ do you know of any of our people in the @entity24 who are going to be alone this @entity319 period ? if you do , i would like to ask them to stay at @entity323 ”			1
that , i thought at the time , was one of the most generous things from somebody with all the pressures on them of being prime minister			0
’ @entity331 one of the @entity333 who founded the @entity333 , recalled the strength of @entity38 ’s marriage to husband @entity337 : ‘ i can not underline too strongly the extent to which i think mrs @entity8 began to lose her life when he passed away			1
’ @entity342 ’s trade secretary , praised her ‘ compassion ’			0
he said : ‘ every night during the six weeks of the ( @entity345 ) campaign she would have a list of the casualties and every night , before going to bed , she would write a long hand - written letter to the parents or the partner			2
’ @entity352 mp a close friend , recalled a taxi ride to her home			2
he said : ‘ i went to pay the driver , but he refused to take the fare			0
the driver said : “ your fare tonight , guv , is you go in there and you tell her from me that we ai n’t had a good’un since ! ” i imparted that message to @entity38 , who looked at me and said : “ well , he ’s quite right			1
