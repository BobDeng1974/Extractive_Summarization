by @entity0 no more ' tinnies ' : the use of @entity4 slang , which was aided by @entity5 , is in decline in @entity7 , according to linguistic experts hello possums ! if you are enjoying a barbie with a few tinnies while wearing your sunnies , you are hopelessly out of date			1
@entity4 slang has fallen out of fashion , experts fear			1
they say that a new generation of @entity4 is coining fewer words of their own and borrowing more from abroad			1
the decline of the backpacker also means that less of the lingo is making its way around the world			0
the warning comes from @entity26 , a linguist at @entity27 and author of the @entity29			1
while the latest edition of the dictionary still contains many long - standing colourful terms , there are just three new additions from @entity35			1
and two of these are just old words that have come back into common usage			0
mr @entity26 said that @entity4 slang first began to take off in the late 19th century , aided by the rich dialects of settlers from @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity45 ’s @entity44			1
he told the @entity46 : ‘ those people were n’t hampered by the upper - class cultures of the @entity7			0
' they were much more free to play with language , creating nicknames for local things , in a way that buttoned - up brits in those days were n’t able to do			0
’ @entity4 ’s convict past also played a role , with slang , even today , still being popular with prisoners and those who want to keep their conversations private			1
but it was in the 1960s and 70s that @entity4 slang really took off , aided and abetted by the popularity of @entity5 and other characters created by comedian @entity64			2
hugely popular @entity4 soap operas also helped spread the world			2
@entity67 , a professor in linguistics at @entity69 , said : ‘ there was certainly a huge shift in attitude towards @entity4 @entity73 in the @entity7 as a result of @entity75			2
‘ it exposed the @entity7 to a much wider variety of @entity4 accents and terminology			2
" rack off " [ get lost ]			0
" @entity80 " [ naff / uncool ]			0
soap influence : @entity67 , a professor of linguistics at @entity69 , said @entity84 's role in @entity75 was partly to blame for the increasing use of phrases such as ' @entity87 ' [ get lost ] ‘ good old @entity84 certainly exaggerated her @entity4 accent as @entity89 , which is partly what made her so popular			1
’ but @entity4 today is much more business - like , and the language used reflects this			0
americanisms are being embraced and young people are latching onto words and phrases from social media , rather than creating their own words			0
but there is one exception , ‘ selfie ’ , the term for self - photographs , is believed to have originated in @entity4			1
former @entity4 prime minister @entity106 was ridiculed when he said that a question whether enough women were promoted was a ‘ fair shake of the sauce bottle ’ meaning fair enough			0
his critics claimed his attempts to appear to be a man of the people by using @entity4 slang were insincere .			0

phrases like tinnies , barbies or sunnies are out of date , say linguistic experts
three new @entity4 phrases are in the @entity29
warning comes from the book 's author @entity26 , from @entity27
@entity130 , however , is believed to have originated from @entity35
