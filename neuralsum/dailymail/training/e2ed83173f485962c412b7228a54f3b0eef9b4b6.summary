by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 3 may 2013 a new brain implant can predict when a person suffering with epilepsy is about to have a seizure			1
the device monitors the brain ’s electrical activity and alerts patients when they are most likely to experience an epileptic fit			1
epilepsy is a neurological condition that causes repeated seizures , also known as fits			1
epilepsy disrupts electrical brain activity causing seizures			1
the the new device trialled in @entity17 could help patients manage their symptoms more effectively it affects over 500,000 @entity21 and although symptoms can develop at any age , it usually begins in childhood			2
seizures are the most common symptom of epilepsy , although many people can have a seizure during their lifetime without developing epilepsy			1
the cells in the brain , known as neurones , communicate with each other using electrical impulses			2
during a seizure , the electrical impulses are disrupted , which can cause the brain and body to behave strangely			2
severity of the seizures can differ from person to person			2
some people simply experience a ‘ trance - like ’ state for a few seconds or minutes , while others lose consciousness and have convulsions while medication can not cure epilepsy , it is often used to control seizures			1
these medicines are known as anti-epileptic drugs			0
in around 70 per cent of cases , seizures are successfully controlled			2
currently the only way to control epilepsy is with medication one of the main dangers of epilepsy is the unpredictable nature of the condition			0
sufferers can have seizures at any time of place			1
the new study , published @entity69 , was carried out on 15 people in three hospitals in @entity17			0
using the new brain implant , signals were collected from the surface of the brain and sent via wires to another implant in the chest			1
this then transmitted the data to a device which worked out the probability of a seizure			0
the success rate was mixed			0
for the first four months , the participants ' brain was monitored so the system could learn the pattern of their brainwaves before a seizure			0
only eight patients were able to progress to the stage where the device was fully activated and they were constantly informed of their chance of a seizure			0
the implant was between 56 per cent and 100 per cent effective in those patients			0
prof @entity100 , from the @entity101 , told the @entity102 : ‘ being able to predict the events with many minutes or hours lead time could have significant impact on independence			1
‘ this could change the way the illness is treated			0
for instance , our current strategy of giving medications continuously because of the unpredictable occurrence of events could alter the types of medications being developed			0
the charity @entity118 cautioned that it was still early days , but said it could be an ‘ exciting development ’ .			1

new device monitors brain activity to calculate the *likelihood* that a patient might have fit
one danger of epilepsy is that seizures can occur anywhere and at any time without *warning*
@entity118 cautioned that it was still early days , but said implant could be an ‘ exciting development ’
