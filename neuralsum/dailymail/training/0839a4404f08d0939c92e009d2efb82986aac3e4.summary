@entity0 has been braced for this kind of bloodthirsty attack , writes @entity3 , but lashing out in this way is seen by some experts as a sign of weakness at first staff thought it was just children playing a boisterous game , for as older pupils sat exams on the upper floor a party was being held for younger classes			1
but then they saw the armed gunmen , the blood and the bodies			0
the @entity22 murderers picked their target with precision then issued a chilling statement			1
‘ we selected the army ’s school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females			2
we want them to feel our pain			2
’ nine gunmen stormed the military school in the north - western @entity0 city of @entity36 today , killing up to 140 children			1
@entity0 has been bracing itself for attack after a military crackdown on the @entity22 's tribal heartlands but nothing of this depravity as heartbroken relatives buried their dead , the @entity22 made it clear this horrific attack was a response to the operation which has wiped out many of its fighters in its @entity51 stronghold			1
they said they wanted the government to ' feel their pain ' more than 1,600 militants have died in recent months but the @entity22 designed the attack to send a message written in blood to the military , which claimed to have cleared them out of their tribal region this cruel attack on an easy target is designed to make a spectacular statement with the least possible cost for the @entity22 @entity0 has been braced for this kind of bloodthirsty attack			1
it is the savage response to a military crackdown on the group ’s tribal heartlands , which claims to have wiped out hundreds of militants			1
this is , after all , a terror group that has made widespread use of suicide bombing , attacked hundreds of schools , massacred teachers , shot a schoolgirl who dared show defiance to them and even killed hundreds of worshippers at mosques and shrines			1
yet it is also a reaction to shifting geopolitics in the region since the election of a new president in @entity91 , which threatens the @entity22 even in its traditional stronghold			2
analysts say the sickening slaughter of schoolchildren symbolises its sudden weakness			0
clearly it is designed to send a message written in blood to the military that claims to have cleared the @entity22 from much of its regional stronghold in the country			1
but it is hard to think of a softer target than a school filled with army children and , for all the horror , may indicate the success of concerted attacks on the long - feared terrorist organisation			0
as one expert said , this cruel shift in tactics to such an easy target is designed to make a spectacular statement with the least possible cost for the @entity22			1
for years @entity117 resisted attacking the fanatics in @entity51 , on the north - west frontier with @entity91			0
both countries blamed their neighbours for harbouring terrorists - with strong justification			0
but in recent months @entity127 ( @entity127 ) , the militant ’s umbrella group that has killed thousands of people in @entity0 , has come under new pressure			1
first a @entity130 drone strike killed long - haired leader @entity131 late last year - and successor has struggled to hold together the organisation as it came under fierce attack			2
splits have been evident with some senior figures pledging allegiance to the leader of @entity139 in @entity140 and @entity141 , while others recently launched a splinter group of @entity144 in the @entity146 sub-continent			0
a father mourns the loss of his son who was killed by @entity22 militants			1
@entity152 , a retired general and security analyst , said the attack was an attempt to weaken military resolve in the region a tearful young pupil lies injured after the second assault in less than six - months by @entity22 militants			1
a june attack on @entity162 airport left 28 dead bombing raids were launched from the air on the @entity22 ’s north - western strongholds in february			1
these were followed four months later by @entity168 , which has since killed more than 1,600 militants			1
the recent election of @entity171 as president of @entity91 , combined with improved relations between @entity117 and @entity174 as well as with @entity175 , has made life tougher for the terrorists on both sides of the border			0
over the past fortnight there have been a series of counter-insurgency assaults on the @entity22 in @entity91			2
on one day this month a @entity130 drone killed nine leading militants and a senior commander captured by @entity130 troops in @entity91 was handed over to @entity117			0
‘ this is something new - @entity91 and @entity0 seem to have finally realised they have a common enemy , ’ said @entity187 , senior research fellow with @entity188 think tank			2
‘ lashing out at schoolchildren in this way is a sign of weakness			0
the @entity127 made it clear this horrific attack in @entity36 was a response to the military operation and the wiping out of its fighters			1
there have been other recent outrages in reaction to the assaults on its heartland			0
in june , 10 militants armed with rifles , rocket - propelled grenades and suicide bomb vests mounted a raid on @entity162 airport that left 28 people dead and damaged several planes			0
operations by the @entity0 military have seen a substantial fall in the number of terrorist attacks in the country			2
army commandos quickly arrived at the school and exchanged fire with the gunmen , but they could not prevent many children being massacred the @entity0 @entity22 has splintered into several groups after a @entity130 drone strike killed their @entity131 , but they remain a powerful force in the region @entity152 , a retired general and security analyst , said this latest attack was designed to weaken military resolve			1
‘ they are going for soft targets , ’ he said			0
‘ these attacks have a great psychological impact			0
’ although @entity0 has long worried about cracking down on militants , fearing the kind of bloodbaths as seen in @entity162 and @entity36 , its operations have led to a substantial fall in the number of terrorist attacks in the country			2
yet @entity246 , an investigative journalist and security analyst , said the country had been expecting a backlash			0
‘ these people have been looking for an opportunity and the trouble is our security is so superficial , which makes it easier for them			0
‘ no - one is ever held accountable for the security failures			0
so we saw no - one fired after the airport attack , for instance			0
’ others queried whether even this attack on a school , killing scores of innocent pupils , will change attitudes			0
two months ago 17 - year - old @entity268 - shot in the head by @entity22 militants - became the youngest winner of the @entity272 for her campaigning on female education			1
yet the honour received scant mention in much of the @entity0 media , criticism from prominent figures in the country and scathing attacks on social media .			2
