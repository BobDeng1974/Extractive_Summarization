but thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance , the @entity7 centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles , and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award			1
in a textbook example of form following function , @entity14 architect firm @entity13 created the series of four - legged pods , seven of them blue and one red , which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up			1
form follows function : the @entity7 centre , a dismantlable research station created for the @entity29 by @entity14 architects @entity13 , has been nominated for the @entity31 2013 the @entity7 centre consists of series of four - legged pods which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up the dismantlable research station , which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the @entity5 wilderness , is among the nominees for the @entity31 2013			1
@entity7 is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the @entity43 - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles ( 16 kilometres ) from the edge of the @entity47			2
most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow , while @entity52 had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart , said survey spokesman @entity56			2
@entity7 is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways			1
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year			0
a central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room , bar and a gym			0
solitude : @entity5 is the most isolated place on @entity71 - but its remote location means the scientists have been able to see the stunning aurora australis futuristic : scientists are housed in triple - glazed modules that sit on skis high above the snowy surface home from home : the modules include house labs , a dining room , a bar and a gym linked : the scientists do not need to go outside to move between modules as they will be joined together by walkways a vacuum drainage system keeps water consumption down , and the ski - clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres ( 13 feet ) above the level of the ice			2
the inside of the centre has been been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter , when temperatures at the base drop as low as -56c			0
it has triple - glazed windows and a quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to contemplate the @entity5 environment in peace			0
the centre , which could easily pass for the set of a 1970s science fiction tv series , is up for the ' higher education / research ' section of the awards , one of 29 categories for which buildings compete in @entity119 in october			2
the @entity121 shopping centre designed by @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124 , is among the nominees for the @entity31 2013 eyecatching : the @entity126 designed by @entity127 architects in @entity128 , @entity129 , is built from mainly natural materials @entity131 designed by @entity132 in @entity131 , @entity133 ( left ) , and the @entity134 designed by @entity135 in the @entity136 , @entity137 ( right ) other nominees include @entity14 - based @entity139 , whose @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142 - clad in curved folds - competes in the ' culture ' category			1
