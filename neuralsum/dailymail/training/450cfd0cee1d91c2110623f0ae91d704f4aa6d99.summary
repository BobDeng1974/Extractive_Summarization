a quick glance at the current @entity2 standings is all you need , to see who is the current top dog in the sport			1
@entity6 is in just his second season at the pinnacle of motorbike racing , but has won 10 of 11 races and is all but certain to reclaim the world championship he won in his rookie year last term			2
just having a quick glance at the standings do not do many of the riders justice however			0
in fact half - way down in 12th is arguably @entity18 ’s most exciting prospect to come through the sport in recent years			2
stand and deliver : @entity20 took @entity21 for a lap around @entity23 in a @entity24 to @entity2 fans , @entity20 needs no introduction			1
the 21 - year - old has worked his way up the series from 125cc ( now @entity30 ) , to @entity31 and for the first time this season , @entity2			1
@entity20 ’s cv already makes for impressive reading			2
originally from @entity35 , a suburb of , @entity36 , he made history in june 2008 when he became the youngest rider of all - time to win a @entity2 race ( aged 15 years and 170 days ) in the 125cc class			1
last season , @entity20 was a front runner in the @entity31 title , winning memorably at @entity23 , and only missing out to @entity44 after picking up an unfortunate injury near the end of the season			1
now he is in the premier class of motorcycle racing … albeit on an open class bike which severely limits @entity20 ’s progression during a race weekend			1
another one of those quick glances at his race results this year see finishes typically just shy of the top 10			2
it may seem a far cry from @entity6 ’s winning ways but @entity20 is giving his @entity24 crew just as much to smile about as the stunning @entity62 leading the way			1
i met up with @entity20 at @entity23 in the build up to the @entity18 @entity2 , and the 21 - year - old was keen to get across that his season targets have already been hit – some as early as the first race of the season			1
home comforts : with a bike draped in the colours of the @entity73 , @entity20 took victory in the @entity31 class at @entity23 last season no. 1 : @entity20 's victory at @entity23 is his last to date , but the @entity78 's career has been on the up ever since 2014 : @entity2 @entity79 2013 : 2nd @entity31 world championship 3 x race wins 7 x podium finishes 3 x pole positions 2012 : 5th @entity31 world championship 3rd @entity31 @entity85 2nd @entity86 3rd @entity87 3rd @entity88 2011 : @entity31 world championship 2010 : 8th - @entity31 world championship 2nd - @entity91 @entity2 3rd - @entity92 2009 : 125cc world championship 3rd - 125cc @entity18 @entity2 2008 : 125cc world championship 1st - 125cc @entity18 @entity2 @entity95 ‘ before we tested we were targeting top seven , top eight , ' @entity20 said			1
‘ but then we realised the bike did n’t have the potential for that			0
after testing when @entity101 [ @entity102 ] was a second in front , we were targeting on closing the gap to him and beating him from the second half of the year			2
‘ but then we got to the first race in @entity110 and i beat him , so my target was done			0
now it ’s [ the target ] simply to be the top open class @entity24 each race			1
’ given that @entity116 is the top open class @entity24 in the @entity118 , it ’s safe to say he is stretching out as much as he can from his machinery			1
curiously , the @entity78 just trails a superior @entity24 in the factory ridden bike of @entity122 in the championship , and it ’s at this point i sense a tinge of excitement , confidence and frustration when we start talking about his options for next year			1
@entity20 clearly believes in his abilities and i get the impression that the 21 - year - old appears bored knowing he ca n’t compete for race wins at this stage in his @entity2 career			1
for @entity116 , the talk of a factory bike almost has him chomping on the bit and he speaks of his desire to land a factory ride – going as far as saying he would rather put his feet up at home rather than compete for another year in the open class			1
one for the future : @entity20 became the youngest grand prix winner of all time when he triumphed at @entity147 in the 125cc category aged just 15 years and 170 days in 2008 it ’s the words and attitude of a talent that truly believes he is ready for the next step as he informs me why he has the belief he is ready to step up to the next level			2
@entity20 added : ‘ @entity24 want to have me for two years , so it ’s just a matter of where and what pieces we have			1
we need to see because @entity162 are struggling at the moment and are speaking to other manufactures so we need to see what happens towards the next few races			0
‘ i have a two - year contract with @entity167 so in theory i need to stay with them so it ’s difficult when they are thinking of going to another manufacture because the factory bike is so expensive and i ’m not going to stay on the open bike			1
i spoke to the team and i ’m not doing that , i ’d rather stay at home			0
‘ i want to be in @entity2 , i do n’t want to be in open class or @entity178 open , i want to be winning races and fighting for the podium , that ’s where i want to be			1
i do n’t want to be messing around in open			0
one year , that ’s fine , two years – not happening			0
‘ i think they [ @entity24 ] were impressed with @entity185 and @entity186			2
@entity186 was good in the mixed conditions and at @entity188 it was ‘ you ’ve done something with this bike that no one has done yet			0
’ that was good for me , and i ’m starting to become more familiar with the bike			0
get down on it : @entity20 has enjoyed a fine first season in @entity2 riding on a @entity24 in the open class ‘ it ’s been quite a big step , but i ’m not full powered @entity2 so it ’s like a step inbetween			1
it was quite a big step to go fast , fast			0
finding the extra half - second was difficult and then you have the race distance			0
‘ it ’s like two more laps than @entity31 with the faster bike and a higher level			0
so it ’s all harder			0
but for me it was nice to have that extra power			0
‘ i would love to have more horsepower in the bike so i can at least mix it with the big guys			0
my strengths are brake and entry speed as well as mid-corner			0
i ’m really strong in changing directions			0
‘ in @entity186 i was quite fast			0
in sector 2 i was top three all weekend through the sector and the same in @entity222 , mixing with the factory boys so it shows in the technical areas i have the ability , but the long straights just kill us			2
’ hold on : @entity20 was at @entity23 in the build up to the @entity18 @entity2 , giving @entity21 a pillion ride thumbs up from us : @entity20 poses with @entity21 's @entity232 inside the garages at the @entity23 circuit and that brings me to the reason why i travelled to the home of @entity18 motor racing to meet the rider who many hope can try at the very least bring home a first premier class win since the great @entity244 in 1981			1
being given the opportunity to ride pillion on the back of a @entity24 around three shortened laps of @entity23 , i held no nerves as i climbed on to the back of @entity20 ’s bike ready for a thrill seeking ride around the circuit			1
we do n’t even make it to the end of the pit lane before my high enthusiasm turns to a mixture of terror and pure excitement			0
looking ahead : @entity20 aims to continue being the top open class @entity24 rider in 2014 flying around the track while constantly breaking the 100mph mark is some experience , as is leaving your seat and almost sitting on @entity20 ’s head every time he brakes going into a corner			1
the terror faded quickly as i got used to the speeds but the excitement never drained even as i spoke to @entity20 shortly after the ride			2
i almost had to pick my jaw from off the ground when the 21 - year - old informed me he was pushing only a third of what he is capable of			1
‘ today was more than normal ! @entity20 said			2
' these superbikes handle better with two people rather than one , believe it or not			0
i do n’t know how much i ’m pushing , i go knee down which i do n’t think many people did with pillion			0
you ’re not breaking on the limit because the riders are changing so the weight is different			0
‘ you can have a small girl who is about 50 kilos and you can have a guy who is 80 kilos – break in the same place and you ’re gone ! ‘ i would say you are pushing at 30 per cent			0
i ’m not twiddling because you want the pillions to feel the load under braking and on the throttle when you feel the bike transfer , while using all the track			0
’ i leave @entity23 convinced that @entity20 ’s career is destined to only take him higher in the sport , and while he may not be rubbing shoulders with the likes of @entity6 and @entity307 this weekend , you certainly wo n’t be surprised if he is stepping on a @entity2 podium should he get his factory ride in the near future			1
@entity2 comes to @entity23 for race weekend on august 29th , race coverage starts from friday at 8:30am and continues on saturday and sunday exclusively live on @entity313 .			2
