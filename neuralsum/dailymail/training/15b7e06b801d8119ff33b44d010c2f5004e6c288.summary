but despite @entity9 ’s insistence that she is ‘ more than a dress ’ , the 42 - year - old barrister and husband @entity6 put on a gushing display mixing romance and fashion for the cameras yesterday			1
they were first pictured – looking casual in jeans – embracing on their hotel balcony , in a moody shot framed by the red velvet curtains of their room			2
labour leader @entity6 and his wife @entity23 in a show of togtherness , shot on the balcony of their hotel room in @entity29 mr @entity6 puckers up for a kiss after his @entity32 conference speech it is more kisses for mr @entity6 , in his £ 750 designer suit , after he and miss @entity9 return to their room after a choreographed stroll hand in hand along @entity29 seafront , it was time for mr @entity6 ’s keynote conference speech			1
by this time he was in a £ 750 navy blue suit from @entity46 designer label @entity44 – whose fans include rapper @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
the high end @entity53 brand is also a favourite of @entity56 and the @entity57 , and the fitted floral dress is part of a slick new wardrobe that @entity23 has deployed for the annual event at a crucial time in her husband 's political career			1
to give her @entity32 speech on monday the mother - of - two chose a classic black flared dress worn with @entity69 heels and statement jewellery			1
earlier in the week , she took to the stage telling @entity32 activists how the couple met , and why she thought he should run for the leadership , as party bosses admitted she ‘ comes across better than him ’			1
on the first day of the @entity32 conference the couple took their sons @entity80 , four , and @entity81 , two , to play on the beach in front of the cameras			1
@entity85 never posed for pictures with his children and , according to the memoirs of @entity89 , even criticised @entity90			0
mr @entity85 thought the @entity92 leader used his family as ‘ props ’			2
previously @entity23 has been one of the more reticent political wags but is stepping up her involvement as @entity6 's poll ratings plummet @entity23 wore a cherry red mac to walk through @entity29 city centre in one of several photo opportunities during the @entity32 conference and chose a simple flared dress to give her ' more than a dress ' speech @entity23 was also snapped in a vivid red mac and smart black trousers on a photo opp tour of the city with husband @entity6 in his ' smart casual ' best on friday			1
although always a stylish dresser , previously the child actress - turned barrister has been one of the more reticent politcal wags , and @entity6 has repeatedly claimed he would not copy @entity90 ’s habit of eye - catching photo opportunities while opposition leader , and would instead focus on policies			1
but party strategists plan to put @entity23 on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and this week the @entity23 and @entity123 has been unleashed on the world			1
the decision to bring mrs @entity126 into the political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by @entity85 and @entity130 to use their other halves to rescue their leadership			0
as @entity23 promises to speak out publicly about why her husband of nine years should be prime minister , the @entity134 children too have been wheeled out in front of the world 's press , swinging arm in arm along @entity29 beach like a mini @entity143 campaign			2
@entity80 , four , and @entity81 , two , have even been labelled as the party 's secret conference weapon			2
party strategists plan to put @entity23 on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and used the party conference to unleashed the @entity23 and @entity123 the couple have been snapped in a series of stage managed photo opportunities designed to humanise the @entity145 leader the couple met in 2004 , but did n't get married until 2011 when @entity23 chose an understated @entity157 dress with no veil			1
as well as revealing her plans to take to the ' barricades ' in support of husband in 2015 the environmental lawyer also revealed the moment she realised she had fallen for him – while rearranging chairs in a hall in @entity168			0
she told delegates : ‘ in may 2005 , @entity6 was the prospective parliamentary candidate for @entity170			0
‘ so i went to @entity168 to help him campaign and i was moving chairs around in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and i became aware there were three long - standing party members watching me			2
‘ after a while one of them said to me who was i , so i explained that i was a friend of @entity179 's and i had come from @entity180 to help him campaign			0
labour leader @entity6 and his wife @entity23 take their children @entity80 ( right ) and @entity184 ( left ) for a walk along @entity29 beach on the eve of the @entity145 annual conference lookalike : mr @entity6 's smart casual attire has been compared to the clothes worn by deputy prime minister @entity192 during a recent photo call ‘ there was a pause and then the lady said to me , “ that 's a very long way to come to move chairs , are you sure you 're just friends ? ”			1
‘ she was clearly very astute and realised before we did i think			0
’ the mother - of - two also told @entity32 members she is willing to help them in the run - up to the 2015 general election before joking : ‘ after all you now know i can door - knock , i can move chairs although i guess falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different dimension			1
nonetheless i am ready and willing			0
’ @entity6 was forced to defend the ' cheesy ' family photographs , which contrast sharply with @entity85 ’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children and the former prime minister ’s accusation that @entity90 used his own family as ‘ props ’ in photographs			0
asked by the @entity219 ’s @entity218 why he had decided to bring them into the public eye ‘ with 500 cameras ’ present , he said : ‘ i love having my family here			0
it ’s a great support and a great thing for me to have them here			0
' @entity6 has defended the pictures of him and his family saying : ¿ i love having my family here			0
it ¿ s a great support and a great thing for me to have them here			0
