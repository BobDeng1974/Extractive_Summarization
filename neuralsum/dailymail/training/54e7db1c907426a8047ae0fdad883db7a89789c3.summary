it is believed that the notorious fake girlfriend scandal earlier this year presented too much of a distraction around @entity1 , a former college standout , and @entity11 suitors decided to pass on him			1
it is another setback from a star estimated to be among the top 24 in this year 's crop of prospects , and missing out in the first round may cost him lucrative sponsorship deals			0
picked : the @entity19 selected @entity1 in the first round with the 29th pick overall class of 2013 : the @entity23 prospects stand on the marquee above @entity25 before the 2013 @entity23 proud dads : @entity27 celebrates with his wife @entity28 and their family at left , while @entity32 holds his daughter at right after he was drafted by the @entity34 49ers also not helping @entity1 was less - than stellar performance during the @entity37 championship game against @entity38 , which raised many concerns about how he would handle himself in the @entity11			1
he also came up short during the @entity11 scouting combine in february , where he ran a 4.82 - second 40 - yard dash , a slow time for a linebacker			2
unpicked : @entity1 , a former @entity46 linebacker , was not present at @entity25 for the draft , opting instead to stay at his home in @entity49 the former @entity46 linebacker was not present at @entity25 for the draft , opting instead to stay at his home in @entity49			1
the teams believed to have taken the most interest in @entity1 - the @entity54 ( 20th pick ) and the @entity19 ( 23rd pick ) - decided to go with and tackle @entity57 and cornerback @entity58 , respectively			1
the @entity19 had another shot at a first - rounder with the 25th pick , but went with @entity63 cornerback @entity62 instead			0
@entity19 was given yet another chance to select @entity1 after trading with the @entity65 to obtain the 29th pick , but shocked @entity1 supporters when they selected wide receiver @entity68 from the @entity69			2
@entity1 will now have to wait until friday , when the second and third rounds of the draft will begin			1
even before the draft started , football fans could not resist taking digs at @entity1 on social networking sites like @entity75 and @entity76			1
one user tweeted a picture of an empty chair with the caption : ' waiting with manti teo 's gf waiting to see what team will draft him			0
' another posted : ' @entity1 has a better chance of getting a call from his fake girlfriend rather than an @entity11 team			1
' @entity1 's tragic story about his girlfriend , @entity90 , tugged on @entity92 's heartstrings last september as @entity46 began their push into the @entity37 championships			1
@entity90 supposedly died around september 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away			0
among those that paid tribute to @entity101 was @entity102 , which showed a picture of her on this morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to @entity1 : ' @entity110 , if anything happens to me , you promise that you 'll stay there and you 'll play and you 'll honor me through the way you play			2
' @entity23 picks : @entity113 , pictured left , and @entity115 , pictured right with @entity11 commissioner @entity116 , were the no. 1 and 2 picks overall humor : several @entity75 users could not resist a joke at @entity1 's expense fake : the @entity75 account of @entity90 was made using photos of @entity125 , a high school classmate of @entity126 who claimed she had never met nor spoken to @entity1 but it was n't until a groundbreaking article on @entity130 that @entity131 was exposed as an elaborate hoax			1
the scheme was found to be orchestrated by @entity134 , who admitted that he used phony @entity75 and @entity76 accounts to get @entity1 's attention , win his affection and carry on an exclusive online relationship			2
in those fake accounts was a picture of a woman , later identified as @entity125 , a high school classmate of @entity126 who claimed that she had never met or spoken to @entity1			1
@entity1 claimed that he was a victim , and was not in on the scandal			1
in an interview with @entity143 in late january , @entity1 said that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend , after discovering she did n't exist			1
but he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax			0
deceived : earlier this week @entity1 emotionally denied he was involved in any sort of cover - up while instead admitting he believed @entity90 , played by @entity134 , was real pressed by @entity143 to admit that he was in on the deception , @entity1 said he believed that ' @entity131 ' had died of cancer			2
' you stuck to the script			0
and you knew that something was amiss , @entity1 , ' the talk show host said			2
he replied : ' @entity143 , put yourself in my situation			0
@entity159 , my whole world told me that she died on september 12			0
this girl , who i committed myself to , died on september 12			0
' @entity143 also asked @entity1 point blank : ' are you gay ? ' cracking a smile , he responded : ' @entity167 from it			2
' the @entity1 episode boosted @entity143 's ratings by 30 per cent			0
self - indulging : @entity134 said that he fell ' deeply , romantically in love ' with @entity1 though he was playing him for a fool while pretending to be a woman in an interview with dr @entity177 , @entity134 admitted that he was gay and fell ' deeply , romantically in love ' with the @entity46 linebacker even though he was deceiving him			0
@entity134 also confirmed that it was him impersonating ' @entity131 , ' despite the fact that voicemail recordings sound high - pitched and feminine			0
since the @entity143 interview , @entity1 has mostly stayed out of the limelight , but appeared at the @entity11 scouting combine in february and was pictured during various workouts			1
