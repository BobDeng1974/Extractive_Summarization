ironing may be the @entity1 of household chores			1
but , love it or loathe it , unless you want to look like you ’ve slept on a park bench , you ca n’t avoid it			0
@entity9 company @entity8 , which sold its first iron in 1933 , has just released a top - of - the - range steam generator iron , for £ 279.99			1
but does it really make things easier ? @entity14 finds out			1
@entity15 @entity16 , £ 279.99 , swan - brand.co.uk if you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost £ 300 , then @entity8 ’s luxury model could be the one for you			1
it cut my ironing time by half			0
it ’s usually my least favouite chore , but when testing this one , i got to work in front of @entity26 and was done within 20 minutes			1
because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank , the iron itself is lightweight			1
the steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron , shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons ( think of the difference in power between jet - washing and using a hosepipe ) — cutting through creases quicker			1
as well as being more powerful , it also produces twice as much steam , making shorter work of wrinkles			1
on the downside , despite the investment , you get only a two - year guarantee			0
3/5 precision perfect @entity50 , £ 29.50 , @entity51 the big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip , which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease , making it perfect for shirts and trousers			1
i also love the vertical steam option , which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics , such as curtains , by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button			1
steam output is 35g per minute — with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases			1
4/5 @entity74 @entity75 , £ 19.99 , argos.co.uk this does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control , which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam			1
but it ’s so heavy , at 1.3kg , that i ’m in danger of developing muscles like @entity90 if i keep using it			0
and while the dolphin - shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas , such as around shirt buttons , it makes the iron look downright ugly			1
i also found the soleplate scaled up quickly			0
2/5 @entity99 @entity101 7 @entity100 , £ 49.99 , @entity102 this looks like a fighter jet , and is so heavy ( 1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full ) it makes ironing even more of an effort			1
on the plus side , the ergonomic handle is easy to hold			0
i also like the way the cable is 2.5m long — useful if you ca n’t get near a plug			0
steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute			2
3/5 @entity118 @entity119 , £ 19.99 , argos.co.uk one of the cheapest irons i tried , this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank			1
there are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option			2
you also get a generous two - metre cord			0
but it falls down on the one job i ’m paying for — ironing			0
although it is supposed to be non-drip , it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt			0
2/5 value for money @entity140 , £ 119.99 , robertdyas.co.uk the nearest rival to the @entity8 iron and less than half the price , this is fantastic value for a top - range model bursting with extras			1
i normally dread ironing my grandmother ’s thick linen table cloth , but i removed every crease in seconds with no effort			0
it ’s all thanks to the impressive 1.5 - litre water reservoir which pumps out high - pressure steam at 110g per minute			2
and the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly — meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing			2
the manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk pjs or kids ’ jeans			0
i tried it — and it was true			0
you also get a five - year guarantee			0
5/5 @entity172 @entity173 , £ 79.99 , @entity102 @entity174 is hugely proud of its cordless iron			1
the base recharges the iron during each rest period , which means there is no cord getting in your way , and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge			2
it ’s powerful , too — delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam			2
the handy steam on - demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner ’s shirts			2
it also has a vertical steam option			2
i used it to blast away creases in a dress that had been hanging in my wardrobe for too long — much easier than dragging out the ironing board			0
if you ’re happy to pay over the odds to dispense with a cord , this is a great option			0
3/5 @entity208 @entity209 , £ 69.99 , argos.co.uk lots of impressive features here — such as a unit which collects all the limescale from your iron			1
a turbo steam function delivers a mighty 200g per minute jet of steam and an anti-drip mechanism cuts down on the chances of water leaking			2
but this iron is too darn heavy : a stonking 1.5kg when empty ; once the 350ml tank is full , it ’s like lifting a brick			0
on the plus side , it provides the perfect excuse to hand over the ironing to my partner			0

@entity9 company @entity8 has *unveiled* a new £ 279.99 super steam iron
