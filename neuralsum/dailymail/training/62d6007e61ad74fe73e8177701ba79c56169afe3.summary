five years ago @entity0 were in the @entity2 relegation zone , had been deducted 10 points and were selling tickets to students for £ 3			2
it was a club which had been on the verge of bankruptcy and was crashing towards oblivion until they were bought by @entity11 who turned them around			0
their rise up the football pyramid , now sitting second in the @entity16 , has been one of the swiftest in @entity19 football			2
@entity20 has guided @entity0 to second place in the @entity16 so far this season @entity0 lost a raft of frontline players over the summer including @entity24 ( right ) who went to @entity25 @entity27 defender @entity26 was another player to move on over the summer , to @entity27 ( right ) sandwiched between current champions @entity29 and @entity31 's @entity30 , the name @entity0 is still an unusual sight			1
however , this is not entirely new territory for fans of the south coast club , who sat third in the table after 11 games last season			1
but it was at this exact stage that reality kicked in and three successive defeats against @entity27 , @entity30 and @entity46 started a run of six in a row without victory			1
@entity50 anchored @entity0 's defence last season ( left ) but he is now on the books at @entity53 with manager @entity20 – whose managerial brilliance rebuilt a severely wounded side bereft of its stars – now talking of a top four finish and those elusive @entity61 places as a possibility , the @entity55 period will be the true test of their credentials			1
' i ’m not looking too much at the rest of the teams , ' @entity20 said after their win against @entity71 on saturday			2
' maybe only in the aspect that i think that i have n’t seen until now teams much better than @entity0			2
a top - four finish would be fantastic			0
' from the end of november until the start of the new year they face @entity29 and @entity30 and also twice come up against @entity27 and @entity25			1
after a slow start to his @entity0 career , @entity78 scored both goals in @entity0 's 2 - 0 win over @entity71 striker @entity83 ( right ) has been in sublime form for @entity0 this season firing in 10 goals defender @entity86 ( right ) , on loan for @entity30 , has been outstanding at the back for @entity20 's side they have won 11 times this season , but @entity53 and @entity93 were their only defeats , suggesting the bigger clubs might cause them problems			1
@entity0 have filled the top flight with some of its biggest names at some of the biggest clubs			0
@entity24 at @entity25 , @entity26 at @entity27 , @entity50 , @entity101 and @entity102 at @entity53 and their former manager @entity103 now in charge at @entity93			0
but at the moment it is @entity0 – and ' the @entity0 way ' philosophy by which the club runs – who top them all			0
their replacements have been some of the buys of the summer – striker @entity83 has fired in 10 goals , forward @entity115 has more than filled @entity101 's boots and @entity117 and @entity86 have shored up the defence			1
until the weekend , new recruit @entity78 was playing in the others ' shadows until his double downed @entity71			0
' it has kind of been on us as a team with so many players leaving and so many players coming in and everyone expecting us to have a bad season , ' @entity78 said			0
' @entity128 in the league takes some doing and we ’re very proud of that			0

@entity20 's @entity0 side are currently second in the @entity16 table behind *unbeaten* *leaders* @entity30
the @entity0 were third in the @entity16 this time last season before three successive defeats against @entity27 , @entity30 and @entity46 started a run of six in a row without victory
@entity0 have won 11 games so far this season
new *signings* @entity83 and @entity115 have *flourished* under @entity20 this term
