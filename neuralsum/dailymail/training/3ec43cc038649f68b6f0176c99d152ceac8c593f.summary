the @entity3 men spent friday night sitting on a plank over two hulls of 25 - foot trimaran as waves left them soaked and cold			1
@entity16 said he and @entity17 recited @entity19 verses and prayed for strength — and calm seas and wind — as their muscles cramped and they violently shivered as they tried to stay warm			1

a strong gust of wind flipped the boat between 4 and 4.30pm a couple of miles from the mainland and more than a mile from the nearest island			2

so he and his best friend put a plank across the hull and hunkered down , back - to - back to give each other warmth and support			2
through the night , with the air temperature dropping into the 40s and water temperatures at 58 degrees , the water lapped onto their plank and on occasion crashed over them			0
