the segregated water fountains and signs pointing african - americans to the back entrances of movie theaters have long disappeared from the streets of the @entity6			0
but in one small @entity9 city there still sits a war memorial that lists fallen @entity11 and ii soldiers in two categories : ' white ' and ' colored '			1
@entity15 mayor @entity14 has been trying to replace the bronze nameplate with plaques that represent the equality of his city today			1
but a state law and critics - of both races - has helped divide the city and made the mayor 's fight much harder than he first expected			1
a war memorial honoring fallen soldiers from @entity29 ( pictured ) separates the men into two categories : ' colored ' and ' white ' on two sides of the memorial , the names of fallen soldiers from @entity29 who died during @entity34 are separated by race			2
racial distinction is absent from the third side of the monument , which lists those who died during the @entity43 and @entity44 wars , because the military was no longer segregated			2
last year the @entity47 post , which owns the memorial , asked @entity14 if he could raise $ 15,000 privately to change the monument			1
@entity14 , who is white and @entity49 - leaning , was so confident he would receive the money he took out a loan so the new plaques could be ready and revealed on @entity53			1
and he had no trouble coming up with the payment			0
forty - three donors , most of whom were white , gave money for the new memorial , and @entity14 likewise wrote a $ 1,000 check for the cause			1
but the mayor 's troubles had only just begun			0
@entity9 's @entity66 flag law forbids any historical monument erected by the state or local government from being relocated , removed , disturbed or altered without a two - thirds vote from the state 's lawmakers			1
the law was created in 2000 after people worried the removal of the @entity66 flag from the @entity78 dome would encourage the destruction of memorials and street and park names that honored @entity66 generals			1
opponents said they could use the law as grounds for having @entity14 arrested , a threat made just days before the @entity53 day ceremony , if he went forward with the new plaque			1
and after the city 's lawyer told @entity14 his opponents were right about the law , the ceremony was halted			1
the mayor said he cried in his office			0
@entity15 mayor @entity14 ( pictured with the memorial ) raised $ 15,000 in private donations to put new plaques on the monument , but critics and a state law are currently blocking his efforts ' i wonder if some of the opposition is racism hiding behind history , ' said @entity14			1
historians , both black and white , have argued that the plaques serve as an important reminder of the once - segregated @entity112 military			2
@entity113 , who spent 32 years as a historian with the @entity115 and is white , said altering the monument would be altering ' its historical integrity			1
' @entity113 , one of the most vocal critics against the change , believes it would be better to add a small display next to the monument explaining why the names are segregated			0
@entity123 of @entity124 in @entity125 , who has extensively studied black soldiers in @entity11 , agreed that the additional sign would be much more powerful and historically accurate			0
' i think it is important to acknowledge the specific context in how @entity132 - @entity112 soldiers had to serve in the military , ' @entity113 said			0
and activist @entity134 equates talk about switching plaques to schools banning @entity139 's ' @entity138 ' because of the racially offensive language from the 1800s sprinkled throughout the book			0
@entity134 , who spends the night in old slave cabins to get attention to preserve them , said changing the monument ' could just spread the perception that segregation did not exist or was n't that bad '			0
opposition only heightened after the mayor was quoted saying , in a local newspaper story about the memorial , ' i think if history offends people it needs to be rewritten if possible			0
' historians , both black and white , have argued that the plaques ( pictured ) serve as an important reminder of the once - segregated @entity112 military and that changing them would hurt the memorial 's ' historical integrity ' the mayor later acknowledged he did n't choose his words carefully , and said he meant that while history does n't change , the way a community presents itself does			1
a bill has been filed to change the @entity15 memorial and half of the members of the @entity170 are listed as sponsors , but some legislators who helped craft the @entity66 flag law are leery to bring the divisive issue up again			1
@entity176 sen. @entity175 , who has been in the @entity170 since 1985 , said he would look at the bill but does n't ' want to reopen the whole debate '			0
' that was last century 's battle			0
' @entity14 said he asked other @entity9 mayors and does n't know of any other similar memorials in the state			2
several historians also said they have n't heard of a monument where fallen soldiers are separated by race			2
freelance journalist @entity188 , who is trying to get @entity9 to remove the statue of a segregationist from the @entity78 grounds , is one of the mayor supporters			2
' every generation has the right to choose the people and the causes it wishes to enshrine in its public places , ' @entity188 said			0
the @entity66 flag removed in 2000 is now in front of the the state 's @entity202 alongside a @entity66 soldier monument			1
it remains a sore point for the @entity207 and other black leaders			0
as for the old plaques , @entity14 had originally planed to put them in the county museum			2
for now they remain on the monument , as the new ones sit in a storage space in @entity216 while the @entity217 prepares to act			0
' i am fully aware this is much tougher than i ever expected , ' @entity14 said			0
' but it 's the right thing to do			0
' the state 's @entity66 flag law forbids any historical monument erected by the state or local government from being altered without a two - thirds vote from state lawmakers			1
it was created in 2000 after people worried @entity66 monuments ( like the one pictured here ) would be removed			2

monument in @entity15 , @entity9 , lists fallen of both world wars
mayor @entity14 raised $ 15,000 in private donations to replace plaques on @entity53
@entity240 's @entity66 flag law forbids historical monuments from being altered without two - thirds vote from lawmakers
historians argue changing memorial would disturb its ' historical integrity '
but supporters and @entity14 say ' it 's the right thing to do '
