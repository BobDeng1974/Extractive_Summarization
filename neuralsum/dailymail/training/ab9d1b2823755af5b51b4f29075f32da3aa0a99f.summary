by @entity0 it used to be the soundtrack to our saturday mornings - the ' whirr , clink - clink - clink ' of the manual lawnmower as it was pushed and pulled over the grass			2
but in 1965 the @entity9 , using technology from the hovercraft , came onto the market - and the @entity12 suburban garden would never sound the same again			1
as a new exhibition at @entity16 's @entity15 explores 50 years of gardening , we can identify the key moments of change , says curator @entity20			1
blast from the past : picture shows a 1960s lawnmower advert the first garden centre opened in @entity25 , @entity26 , in 1955 after its owner visited the @entity28 searching for ideas to rescue his struggling nursery business and returned saying he 'd ' seen the future '			1
he went on to open the first garden centre café in 1961			1
container - grown plants were the key to making gardening an all - year - round activity			1
until the early 1960s shrubs and trees were grown in nurseries and transplanted when dormant between november and march			0
the first container plants were grown in recycled tomato tins , before the advent of plastic pots in the 1970s before the ubiquitous winter - flowering pansy arrived in 1979			0
the mail - order seed industry , with its garish catalogues full of promise , went into decline - only to enjoy a revival thanks to the current trend for wildflower meadows			1
' we needed a 1970s rubber plant for the exhibition ... and it was hard to find one , ' says @entity20			1
but moth orchids , once rare and exotic , are sold in every supermarket			0
a plant catalogue from the 1960s the 1960s garden shed was filled with powders and potions marked ' poison '			1
although the pesticide @entity66 was banned in many countries in the 1970s , @entity65 presenter @entity64 was a retired @entity68 ' chemist who continued to promote chemical gardening			1
his predecessor ( and former @entity72 gardening writer ) @entity73 was sacked by the @entity74 for a lucrative advertising deal for fertiliser			2
you had to sign the poisons register at a licensed dealer 's to buy tins of nicotine shreds for fumigating a greenhouse infested with insects			2
and try not to breathe in - nicotine is a nerve gas			0
sodium chlorate , an effective weedkiller , was banned in the @entity88 because of its toxicity			0
but the 1970s , and the tv sitcom @entity91 , saw a surge of interest in organic gardening , championed in the 1980s by @entity95 in his garden at @entity97			1
the turning point for garden design , though , was @entity100 , which advocated decking			2
' before that , gardens had lots of flowers , a lawn and a vegetable patch that was a hangover from the war , ' explains @entity20			0
' but then people started travelling abroad and eating outdoors , and the garden became an extension of the house and a sphere for personal expression			2
' it was the start of patios , water features and garden @entity121 projects			2
and then came @entity123 , first broadcast in september 1997 and attracting 12 million viewers at its peak , which caused @entity128 's sales of garden decking to rocket from £ 5,000 in 1997 to £ 16 million by 2001			1
a 1960s gardener would be shocked that lawns have made way for driveways today , says @entity20 , and intrigued by the trend for ready - to - go topiary			2
' it 's about gardening becoming easier			1
you can leave the garden centre with an instant garden , which seems to fulfil a sort of craving in modern life			1
