by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 3 august 2013 risk : nearly six million children in @entity3 have rotting teeth or are facing tooth decay nearly half of the 12 million children in @entity3 have rotting teeth or are at serious risk of tooth decay , according to a damning official report			1
sugary drinks , snacks between meals and poor dental checks are all blamed for the rapid deterioration of children ’s teeth before they are eight			1
by the time they are 17 , six in ten suffer from tooth decay or gum disease , or are at risk of the problems , according to a @entity26 survey			1
the worrying results come after the introduction of a ‘ traffic lights ’ scheme which is being trialled in 95 dentists ’ surgeries in @entity3 and which the government is hoping will lead to a revolution in dental care			1
under the new system , patients will be given a more thorough check - up than currently provided on the @entity39 , and then given a ‘ green ’ , ‘ amber ’ or ‘ red ’ rating on the condition of their teeth and gums			0
initial results from the trial , seen by @entity47 , show that 28 per cent of @entity3 ’s 44 million adults and 13 per cent of children under 18 have a red rating , meaning they are actively suffering from tooth decay or gum disease			1
a third of children and more than half of adults are classed as amber , meaning that they are at serious risk of dental problems			2
only 16 per cent of adults and 55 per cent of children were given a green rating for healthy teeth and gums			2
every year about 30,000 children end up being admitted to hospital because of rotten teeth			2
many have five or six taken out at once , with some having the whole set of 20 baby teeth removed			0
dr @entity68 , a @entity69 - based paediatric dentistry consultant , described the figures as ‘ worrying ’ and said that too many parents let their children snack throughout the day			0
he added : ‘ we know children who eat and drink between meals are much more likely to get dental decay			1
’ consumption of ‘ healthy ’ pure fruit juices and products marketed as ‘ no sugar added ’ had also exploded , he said			1
‘ parents think they are giving their children healthy drinks between meals , but they can do a lot of damage			2
’ explosion : there has been a sharp rise in the number of ' no added sugar ' products available on the market , but these can be high in naturally occurring sugar such drinks were doubly dangerous as they were high in naturally occurring sugar as well as being acidic , which weakened the enamel			1
‘ the average level of decay in five - year - olds now is very similar to the level in 1983 , ’ he said			2
but in poorer areas the situation was worse , with deprived children losing more teeth by five than in the early 1980s			1
the pilots , which could be rolled out across the country by 2015 , are designed to replace the much criticised contract , devised by @entity110 in 2006			0
this contract is extremely unpopular with some dentists , who say it promotes a quick - fix ‘ drill and fill ’ approach because it offers rewards for carrying out treatment rather than keeping patients ’ teeth healthy			0
last year , the @entity120 found that unscrupulous dentists were duping patients into paying millions of pounds for private treatment that should be free on the @entity39			0
however , @entity124 , chief dental officer for @entity3 , last night claimed the traffic - light findings were ‘ not statistically robust ’ and stressed : ‘ there is no country in the world that has lower rates of children ’s tooth decay			1
’ dr @entity124 helped preside over the 2006 contract , in which dentists are paid for how many ‘ units of dental activity ’ they carry out			0
he admitted : ‘ it seems perverse to continue to pay dentists to do more and more treatment , when the volume of disease is falling			0
we want to pay them according to better outcomes for patients			0
’ dr @entity144 , chairman of the @entity145 of the @entity146 , welcomed the move towards preventative dentistry as ‘ a positive step forward ’ , but said more still needed to be done to improve children ’s teeth .			0
