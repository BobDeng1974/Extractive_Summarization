the youngster was just ten - months - old when she had a first fit and has even suffered five in one day			2
@entity15 ! @entity8 's parents try to stop their daughter from being surprised as it can trigger a fit surprise , pain and excitement can trigger a seizure so her mother @entity24 , 26 , tries to make sure her daughter avoids the unexpected			1
ms @entity24 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , said : ' playing something like @entity29 is out of the question			2
' her cousin can just brush past her or the door will bang and she will have a seizure			2
' something will make her jump and her face will freeze			2
her body locks and her eyes roll back in her head			2
then she falls to the ground			2
it ’s like she ’s frozen in time			2
her heart and brain stops			1
' her back arches and she will have a fit			2
the longer she ’s unconscious , the longer she ’s starved of oxygen , which can cause brain damage			1
' @entity8 , who is unable to go to nursery because of her condition , was at home with her parents when she had her first fit			1
ms @entity24 said : ' we ’d just got in from shopping			2
my keys had been left on the side by the bags and @entity8 picked them up			1
' i took them off her and carried on putting the shopping away			1
when i turned around again she ’d gone all floppy			0
' i picked her up then she went completely unconscious			0
i really thought she had gone			0
i did n’t think she was coming back			0
' @entity24 and @entity62 with daughter : they are hoping @entity8 will grow out of the condition father @entity62 , 26 , who works for @entity66 , quickly checked @entity8 ’s airways thinking she had accidentally swallowed something , while @entity24 called an ambulance			1
by the time it arrived , @entity8 had come back to life			1
she was kept in hospital over night so doctors could check her @entity76 the results came back normal , they put it down to deliberate breath - holding , which are common in babies and not harmful			0
however , two months later @entity8 collapsed three times in the space of a week			1
her mother took her back into hospital but , again , a doctor said it was a breath - holding spell			0
ms @entity24 said : ' i was n’t convinced that was it so i looked on the internet			0
' there was a video of a little boy and the position of the boy ’s body was exactly the same as @entity8 ’s when she has a fit			1
' the heading on the video was @entity9			0
i was certain that ’s what she had			0
' she then contacted the charity @entity102 ( @entity103 ) who believed @entity8 had the condition and suggested she see a paediatrician specialising in cardiology			1
@entity24 said of @entity8 : ' she 's a really girly girl , she just ca n't stop chatting ' back at the hospital , @entity8 had three @entity109 to record electrical activity in her heart and an ultrasound scan			1
during this time , she caught a viral infection and her heart rate became dangerously high			0
@entity8 was rushed into hospital and was kept in for four days while they monitored her heart			1
doctors were left baffled when all the tests came back clear so @entity8 was later referred to a specialist at the @entity120 in @entity121 was diagnosed with @entity9 last month			1
ms @entity24 said : ' the condition is so hard to diagnose			0
they had to eliminate everything else first			0
' having a diagnosis felt like a weight had been lifted			0
' @entity9 are caused by the vagus nerve being over stimulated due to an unexpected stimulus such as pain , shock or fear			0
it can cause a sudden lack of blood in the brain , which means she temporarily stops breathing and loses consciousness			1
there is no known cure for the condition but children ’s attacks tend to lessen as they get older			0
her parents hope @entity8 will eventually grow out of the condition			1
doctors have shown her parents how to put their daughter in the recovery position and have warned them to avoid surprising @entity8			1
ms @entity24 , who gave up her job as a receptionist to care for @entity8 said : ' we ca n’t make her jump			1

ms @entity24 said : ' she ’s a really girly girl			0
she does n’t stop chatting			1
' we try to keep things as normal as possible			0
her condition wo n’t stop her doing things other kids do			2
' her parents are now waiting for @entity8 to be fitted with a device to monitor how long her heart stops during an episode to see if she will need a pacemaker when she is older			1

' patients will pass out , the heart stops and their breathing stops and this can be very shocking for small children and their families			2
