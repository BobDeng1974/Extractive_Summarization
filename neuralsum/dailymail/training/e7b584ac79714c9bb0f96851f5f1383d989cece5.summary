@entity1 's early exit from international cricket is unbelievable , according to his former @entity4 teammate @entity3			1
@entity1 's book release earlier this month effectively ended his chances of playing for @entity4 again , after the 34 - year - old attacked former teammates and coach @entity9 , but @entity3 revealed that he could still be playing			1
' i think it 's unbelievable in a way , because certainly he could still be playing for @entity4 quite easily , ' @entity3 told @entity13			2
' it is sad to think that probably the best cricketer i have ever played with is not playing [ internationally ] any more			0
' @entity3 ( left ) believes @entity1 ( right ) could easily still be playing international cricket @entity1 's book launch ruffled feathers and has effectively ended his chances of playing for @entity4 again @entity1 ( left ) attacked former coach @entity9 ( right ) in his autobiography despite his absence on the international stage , the 34 - year - old will join @entity3 in @entity23 for the upcoming @entity24 , where he will feature for @entity25 at the end of the year			1
@entity3 , who himself will be playing for @entity27 in an attempt to acclimatise for the @entity29 in @entity23 and @entity30 , believes that we will see a different side to @entity1 when he takes to the field for the first time on december 18			1
' a guy i have had huge respect for , for a very long time and learnt a huge amount from is n't playing probably as much as he should be			0
but it is tournaments like the @entity24 that will benefit from that and i think everybody will see a different side to @entity1 than they normally would			2
' because everybody sees him in an @entity50 series trying to fight against @entity23 whereas he will be on somebody 's side now			0
i think you will see a very relaxed side to @entity1			0

@entity1 was *sacked* from international cricket in *february* 2014
@entity3 believes that he could easily still be playing now
@entity1 's autobiography attacked former players and coaches
