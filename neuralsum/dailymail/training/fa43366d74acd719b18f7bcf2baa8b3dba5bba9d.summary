@entity0 , pictured , matches job applicants to employers in a similar way to how @entity4 matches people to dates finding a date and finding a job are two of the trickiest things to do			1
the @entity4 app already removes the hassle from dating by letting users simply click yes or no on other people 's profiles - and now a startup has created a similar system for job hunters			1
called @entity0 , employers and applicants can upload their details and search for the right match at the click of a button			1
users can either connect to the service using their @entity28 page , or fill in their profile manually with education and work experience			1
they can then select whether they ’re looking for full or part time work , or internships , as well as the kind of job they ’re interested in			0
at the moment , only employers from a select number of industries have signed up , and it 's predominantly @entity40 - based firms , so the choices are a little limited			1
@entity0 users can also state where they currently work , and whether they ’d be willing to relocate			2
finally , the site asks users to upload their cv before being shown relevant @entity48 preferences can be updated at any time , as can the user ’s profile information			2
each job vacancy is displayed with the name of the company , the job title and a one - sentence description			0
applicants can then click the red ' thumbs down ' button to reject a vacancy , or the green ' thumbs up ' button to express an interest			0
@entity0 users can either connect to the service using their @entity28 page , or fill in their profile manually with education and work experience			1

the site ’s creator posted on @entity120 , under username @entity121 : ‘ the reason for [ @entity0 ] was simple - finding a job is a pain and you almost never find ones you actually want			1
‘ because of this i developed a simple setup - a few questions about what your ideal job looks like and then use @entity28 information for background and experience			1
‘ on the backend employers are doing the same to find appropriate matches			0
it 's a new way to find jobs that you actually want and it 's as easy as using @entity4			0
’ an alternative app , that works in a similar way to @entity0 is @entity144 , it lets users like or dislike vacancies , and employers can do the same with applicant profiles			1
the @entity150 app is available for @entity151 and @entity152 .			0

@entity154 - based @entity0 matches job applicants to employers
it works in a similar way to how @entity4 matches people to dates
users can connect with their @entity28 profile or fill in their profile manually
they can then select the type of job they *'re* looking for , and their location
applicants and employers then scroll through profiles clicking yes or no
*majority* of jobs on the site are based in the @entity40 , but it is looking to expand
