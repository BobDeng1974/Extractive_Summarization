the @entity1 tortured @entity3 suspects in the wake of 9/11 in a bid to prove @entity6 was behind the atrocity so they could justify the 2003 invasion of @entity10 , it has been revealed			1
the agency came under immense pressure from @entity14 's administration to forge a link between the former @entity10 dictator and @entity3 as it sought to bolster its argument for war			1
but an official 2009 report on detainee abuse - revealed by @entity21 - claimed that the increasingly brutal methods of interrogations used to extract confessions yielded no hard evidence to back the theory			0
brutal : the @entity1 tortured @entity3 suspects in the wake of 9/11 in a bid to prove @entity6 was behind the atrocity and therefore justify the 2003 invasion of @entity10 , it has been revealed ( pictured : a terror suspect is carried back to his cell following interrogation at @entity35 ) excuse for war : the agency came under immense pressure from the administration of then - president @entity14 ( left ) to forge a link between @entity6 ( right ) and @entity3 as it sought to bolster its argument for war the claim came in a dossier compiled by the @entity43 , which quoted former @entity45 psychiatrist , major @entity46 , stationed at @entity35 as saying interrogators were told to focus on a single line of inquiry			1
' a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between @entity3 and @entity10 , ' he said			1
' there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results '			0
a source told the @entity61 news agency that there were two reasons for wanting to prove @entity6 's involvement : first , senior @entity66 officials wanted to prevent a second attack and , second , ' for most of 2002 and into 2003 , [ vice-president @entity69 ] @entity68 and [ @entity70 ] @entity71 were also demanding proof of the links between @entity3 and @entity10			1
' back from the torture chamber : it follows a @entity77 @entity43 report which cast light on the range of ' brutal ' interrogation techniques meted out on terror suspects in the years following the destruction of the @entity83 torture : waterboarding was deemed acceptable because it did n't cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture but when told by the @entity1 that the programme was producing no concrete results , @entity68 and @entity71 pushed for tougher questioning			1
the source added : ' there was constant pressure on the intelligence agencies and the interrogators to do whatever it took to get that information out of the detainees , and when people kept coming up empty , they were told by @entity68 's and @entity71 's people to push harder			2
' the @entity1 has defended its conduct by claiming that the relationship between torture and results was ' unknowable , ' a claim rejected by the chairman of the @entity110 , @entity109 , who maintained that torture produced nothing of value			2

' push harder ' : a source said that ' for most of 2002 and into 2003 , [ vice-president @entity69 ] @entity68 ( far right ) and [ @entity71 ( far left ) were also demanding proof of the links between @entity3 and @entity10 ' and demanded interrogators ' push harder ' when no evidence was found in one of several memos forming the legal underpinnings for brutal interrogation techniques , the @entity1 was told detainee @entity130 could lawfully be placed in a box with an insect , kept awake for days at a time and slapped multiple times in the face			1
waterboarding , too , was acceptable because it did n't cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture , the 2002 @entity137 memo says			0
the release last week of a @entity43 report cataloging years of such interrogation tactics has revived debate about legal opinions since discredited and withdrawn and about the decision to not prosecute the program 's architects or officers who used the methods			2
civil rights groups in the @entity77 and abroad are renewing calls to prosecute those who relied on techniques that president @entity156 has called torture			0
' how can we seriously use the phrase ' rule of law ' if crimes of this magnitude go uninvestigated and unprosecuted ? ' said @entity162 , deputy legal director at the @entity163			0
the @entity137 , which spent years looking into the matter , says it lacks sufficient evidence to convict anyone and found no new information in the report			0
it also is far from clear that any international case could be brought .			0
