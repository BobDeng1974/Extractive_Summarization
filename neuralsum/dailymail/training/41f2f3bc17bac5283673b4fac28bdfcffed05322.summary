the couple got engaged after re-kindling their relationship , just a month before mr @entity0 passed away last night , @entity0 's devastated mother broke the tragic news of his death on @entity156 skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world , affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the @entity20 every year			1
there are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases			2
@entity167 - which mr @entity0 has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease			1
beginning in the skin , it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs			0
the most common symptom of this form of cancer is a new mole , most frequently appearing on the back , arms and legs , or changes to an existing mole			2
these types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm			0
@entity185 has devised an @entity187 checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes : applying sunscreen and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer the more moles a person has on their body , the higher your risk of melanoma			0
it does n't guarantee a person will definitely get melanoma , but it means a person should take greater care in the sun. the larger a mole , the higher the risk of melanoma			2
a large mole is one greater than 5mm in diameter			0
people with just one unusually shaped or very large mole , have a 60 per cent increased risk of melanoma			2
non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin			0
while not all forms are preventable , it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways			0
applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit uv rays			0
exposure to uv rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer , though family history , fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person 's chance of developing it .			0
