most of us remember the days when we could play football and ride our bikes in the street without too much fear of anything happening more ghastly than a grazed knee			0
but that 's not the case for the growing number of children being brought up in cities and large towns			2
so a group of parents in @entity16 have decided to adopt an idea that will see their road closed , cars driven out of the way and children will have free reign to play			1
they also hope closing the road to traffic for two hours every week will help boost community spirit and give children a safe place to play during the summer			1
parents and children in @entity16 react to the news that they can close their street for two hours to allow free play from august road closures during the @entity32 have seen an increase in the popularity of street parties			2
@entity36 , communications co-ordinator for playing out , an organisation that helps communities with similar schemes , said that @entity40 was the first city to adopt the idea			1
ms @entity36 said : ' the main aim behind it and the way it grew was based on active play , particularly for urban children that do n't live near any green space			1
' @entity40 was the first local authority to make it easy for residents to apply for regular road closures for play and brought in a new policy to enable this to happen across the city			1
' some streets carry out road closures once a week while many others do it every two weeks or once a month			2
she added that the idea was beneficial to children 's health and got neighbours together , helping gain a sense of community			1
childminder @entity67 said : ' it 's not just about children playing out			0
it 's about the community reclaiming their streets and using the area not only as something you drive through but somewhere you catch up with your neighbours			1
' the schemes are designed for children in urban areas who do n't always have access to green space mrs @entity67 said families wanted to continue what they had started with their @entity87 street party last summer			1
she said : ' it was great to see the kids out in the street going up and down on their scooters			0
' one of my neighbours put a little slip through the door about a scheme in @entity40 and asked if it was something i would like to set up			1
' i contacted the people in @entity40 and they have been really helpful with the legal stuff			2
we spoke to @entity102 and said we would like to pioneer the scheme			0
' we 're going to be guinea pigs and if it works we can encourage others to do it and if it does n't then at least we have tried			0
' the scheme was first used in @entity40 two and a half years ago			2
mothers @entity109 and @entity111 wanted to get to know their neighbours better			0
three years later there are more than 30 streets in @entity40 and beyond replicating their playing out sessions the first closure in @entity118 will take place next month			1
residents of @entity118 will have to inform @entity102 when they want to close the road in advance			0
they will then be able to shut it to cars for two hours			0
residents will act as wardens at either end of the closure			0
they will instruct through traffic they can not enter as well as letting through emergency vehicles			0
many people living on the street have said they will move their cars for the closure , but it is not compulsory , and people can drive down the street as long as they are going at walking speed and guided by stewards			0

streets closed to cars for children who do n't have access to green space
organisers hope it will help boost community spirit among neighbours
