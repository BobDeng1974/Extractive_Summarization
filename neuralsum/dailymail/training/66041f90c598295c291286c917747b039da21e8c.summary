@entity1 @entity0 said he did not wish to be considered for the pay - out in his first full year in charge the boss of @entity5 is facing a fresh row over fat cat pay as he prepares to collect a £ 1million windfall			1
in a bid to avoid negative publicity when he took the helm in october last year , @entity0 said he did not wish to be considered for the pay - out in his first full year in charge			1
but the show of restraint from the @entity16 will cease next august , despite @entity1 being fined almost £ 400million last month for rigging the £ 3.5trillion - a - day foreign exchange market			1
it is understood chief executive officer mr @entity0 has no intention of waiving a £ 1million shares windfall , equivalent to one year ’s salary			1
it would take his maximum pay package for 2015 – including salary , pension and performance - related long term bonuses – to almost £ 4million			1
last night one mp described the award as ‘ wholly inappropriate ’ and said mr @entity0 and fellow bosses should show some ‘ moral backbone ’ and forfeit their windfalls			2
to get around the bonus cap , most of the major banks introduced additional payments – known as fixed ‘ role - based ’ allowances – on top of annual bonuses to ensure top executives are not left out of pocket			0
the @entity43 bonus cap limits banks to paying a maximum of one year ’s fixed pay , rising to twice this if shareholders approve			2
but the new pay - outs are guaranteed and count as part of an executive ’s basic pay package , pushing up the maximum bonus that can be awarded			1
last night one senior banking insider suggested mr @entity0 would be unable to waive his pay - out even if he wanted to , because this would breach ‘ the spirit ’ of the @entity43 laws which dictate these payments are not discretionary , unlike bonuses			1
but @entity61 , a @entity62 member of the @entity63 , described this as ‘ nonsense ’			0
he said : ‘ it is wholly inappropriate for a taxpayer - owned bank that ’s mired in scandal to be awarding bonuses at all			0
' claiming that “ @entity70 made us do it ” is total nonsense			0
it ’s about time these bankers showed some moral backbone			0
’ the @entity78 ’s big four high street banks have handed out £ 30million in share awards to their top management this year in their efforts to sidestep @entity83 ’ cap on banker bonuses			2
the biggest award of role - based allowances to a management team was at @entity88 , which handed chief executive @entity89 £ 1.7million in share awards			2
in a bid to avoid negative publicity when he took the helm in october last year , mr @entity0 said he did not wish to be considered for the pay - out in his first full year in charge @entity1 handed out shares worth almost £ 5.5million to its ten most senior bankers – with the exception of mr @entity0			1
his £ 1million windfall will be paid in instalments over five years			1
@entity1 has squandered every penny of taxpayers ’ rescue cash after racking up £ 46billion in losses since the financial crisis – more than £ 1,500 for every taxpayer in the @entity78			2
it made losses of £ 8.2billion last year but still paid out £ 588million in bonuses			2
it is expected to be even more generous this year as it is on course to make its first full year profit since the financial crisis			1
@entity112 , of campaign group the @entity114 , added : ‘ @entity1 is a government - owned bank – so mr @entity0 is a public servant			1
to be raking in such a preposterous sum of money will be completely unpalatable to taxpayers			0
’ he added : ‘ these bonuses are clearly not rewarding good behaviour as banks are rotten to the core with scandal and bad practice			0
more than six years have passed since @entity1 was bailed out to the tune of £ 46billion , yet there is precious little sign of taxpayers getting their money back			2
in the meantime , @entity1 has lurched from one scandal to the next – from duping thousands of customers into buying worthless insurance , to allegations it deliberately drove small businesses to the wall to boost its profits			0
most of the fiascos happened before mr @entity0 took over – and he has pledged to clean up the bank			0
last month @entity1 was fined almost £ 400million for rigging the foreign exchange market			1
it was also fined £ 700million for manipulating ‘ @entity147 ’ interest rates – used to set mortgage rates for millions of homeowners			1
and so far it has set aside £ 3.3billion to compensate customers who were mis - sold payment protection insurance			0
all the efforts to circumvent the bonus cap and keep paying these huge bonuses show banks are being run in the interests of bankers			0
’ the @entity78 ’s biggest high street lenders will start announcing their bonuses for the past year in the coming weeks			0
last month @entity158 withdrew a legal challenge to the @entity43 bonus cap after it was rejected by a key adviser to the @entity162			0
the @entity63 had argued the cap would inflate basic pay , making it harder for banks to trim costs in lean years , while also causing top staff to move to @entity169 and @entity171 rivals			0
@entity1 declined to comment on mr @entity0 yesterday .			1

@entity0 did not accept the pay - out in his first full year in charge
but this year he has no intention of waiving a £ 1million shares windfall
it comes despite @entity1 being fined almost £ 400m last month for rigging the £ 3.5 trillion - a - day foreign exchange market
