the @entity1 play - off final is famously the single most lucrative one - off fixture in the whole of global sport , and it ’s now richer than ever			1
@entity6 can reveal that the payday for the winner of this weekend ’s showdown between @entity10 and @entity11 will be £ 134million - at least			1
that sum is new income that the winner will accrue , at minimum , over the next five years , that the loser will not			0
it ’s winner takes all , and that £ 134m is a worse - case scenario			1
big money : the @entity1 play - off final is the most lucrative one - off fixture in global sport £ 134m - for winning 2013 - 14 @entity1 play - off £ 47.7m - most lucrative boxing purse ever , @entity25 ’s earnings from his fight against @entity27 last year £ 13.8m - the biggest prize ever for winning a single cricket match , @entity32 ’s notorious @entity31 superstars v @entity33 in 2008 £ 6.9m - the biggest prize in golf , the bonus for winning the @entity37 £ 6.9m - the biggest prize in horse racing , for winning the @entity40 £ 5.97m - or $ 10m , which is the difference in prize money between winning this summer ’s @entity43 in @entity44 ( $ 35m ) and being runner - up ( $ 25m ) £ 3.26m - or 4m euros , which is the difference in prize money between winning this year ’s @entity49 final ( 10.5m euros ) and being runner - up ( 6.5m euros ) that sum is broken down into £ 62m of @entity53 prize money even if finishing bottom of the @entity53 next season , plus four years of subsequent ‘ parachute ’ payments totaling a further £ 72m at least			1
parachute payments are made to relegated clubs for four years after going down and are based on a complicated formula relating to what clubs in the top division earn from central funds each season			2
to simplify matters , that £ 72m is expected to be made up of parachute payments of around £ 26.4m in 2015 - 16 , £ 21.6m the following year , and £ 12m in each of the two years after that			2
prize : @entity11 will be hoping to beat @entity10 for a place in the @entity53 worth it : @entity71 have managed to build on their 2013 success and stay in the @entity53 it may in fact rise in the final two years depending on the value of future tv contracts signed from 2016 onwards but that can not be forecast specifically at this stage			1
to stress the point : the £ 134 million is a worse - case scenario of new income for the play - off winner			1
if they do n’t immediately get relegated , their new riches will be bigger and last for longer			0
and they will almost certainly earn extra ticket income and sponsorship cash from being in the @entity53 on top of the extra central revenue			0
there is an argument that the play - off is worth not nearly as much as the headline figure because the extra money will inevitably be spent on pricey signings and big wages - and that is a perfectly legitimate argument because most promoted clubs do in fact spend most of the new cash on those things			2
but that is not mandatory			0
promoted clubs do not always do that			0
some use it to improve facilities , invest in academies , or simply boost the owners coffers			0
carrot : @entity112 's @entity10 can scoop the £ 134m jackpot with a win against @entity11 at @entity115 lucrative : @entity25 ( right ) earned £ 47.7m from his fight against @entity27 ( left ) @entity53 referee @entity117 will take charge of the @entity1 play - off final match between @entity11 and @entity10 at @entity115 pn saturday			1
whichever way you look at it , winning the play - off brings a massive windfall , a windfall that in 2014 will be £ 134m ... and counting			1
as the accompanying panel shows , the stakes are higher in the play - off by far than for any other one - off event in global sport			2
the ' marginal gain ' of winning and losing this weekend 's @entity49 final , for example , is a mere £ 3.26m , or the difference in extra prize money between the winner ( 10.5m euros ) and runner - up ( 6.5m euros )			0
cost : there is a difference of £ 3.26m between winning and losing the @entity49 final			0

the @entity1 play - off final winners will accrue £ 134m over the next five years
the @entity115 *showpiece* is the most lucrative one - off fixture in sport
the promoted club will earn £ 62m just for being in the @entity53 next season
@entity11 and @entity10 will play for a place in the @entity53
