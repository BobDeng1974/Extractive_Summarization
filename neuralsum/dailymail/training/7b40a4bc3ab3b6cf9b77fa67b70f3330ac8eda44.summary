by @entity0 published : 00:43 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:45 est , 3 february 2014 this year 's @entity4 at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity3 was tailgate free meaning there was no wild and beer infused pre-game party in the football stadium 's parking lot			1
not only was there no tailgate debauchery and no smells of hamburgers sizzling on the grill , there was also very limited parking space			2
for all the 83,000 game tickets sold there were only 13,000 parking spaces costing $ 150 each			1
' you will be allowed to have food in your car and have drink in your car			0
and provided you 're in the boundaries of a single parking space , you 'll be able to eat or drink right next to your car			2
however , you 're not going to be able to take out a lounge chair , you 're not going to be able to take out a grill , and you 're not going to be able to take up more than one parking space			0
and it 'll all be watched very carefully			0
' said ceo of @entity4 committee @entity37 prior to the event			1
@entity39 provided security for @entity41 between the @entity42 and the @entity43 and made sure no one broke the tailgating rule ever since 9/11 , the @entity46 stepped up regulations at sporting events nationwide and aimed to limit potentially dangerous crowding outside the stadium , reports the @entity51			1
some feel as though fans were at a serious loss			0
and some fans were vocal on twitter about the lack of tailgating to be had and the crowded trains			2
' you ’re losing the smell of smoke in the air , you ’re losing the visual power of seeing a big piece of meat cooking over an open flame , @entity67 , a chef whose tailgate parties prior to @entity70 games at @entity5 have become legendary , told the @entity72			1
' i think that ’s a loss because as a chef , your visual , your smell ... people start showing up that you do n’t know , they come over ... ‘ what are you guys doing ? ’ they see smoke , they smell something different			0
so there ’s an anticipation , sitting in the cold parking lot drinking a beer , waiting for the pork to be done or waiting for the steak to come off			1
the anticipation builds , ' he continued			0
taxis and car services like @entity94 were n't even allowed into the stadium 's parking lot			1
fans were told that they would n't be able to walk to the game either , reported @entity99			2
that means roughly 70,000 fans had to find a way to get to the stadium without driving , cabbing , or walking -- and they were n't too thrilled			0
tailgating is a tradition for many @entity107 sporting events even though the @entity109 and the @entity110 were clear of traffic , the railroads were an utter nightmare			1
since there were such few spots in the game parking lot , journalists and @entity117 were shuttled by bus and other attendees took the @entity121 train to the game			1
the @entity124 bus was a bus that picked up from several locations around the city to transport people to the stadium but tickets cost $ 51			0
@entity42 and @entity131 were so disgruntled from the crowded trek they yelled , ' @entity3 , your @entity4 sucks , ' reported breitbart.com			2
@entity137 of @entity138 posted a pic on @entity140 along with the caption , ' world 's @entity135 tailgate			0
this was probably the @entity4 with the world 's most frustrated fans			1
this is the world 's saddest tailgate party			0

ever since *911* , the @entity46 has *cracked* down on large sporting events such as the @entity4
fans missed out on tailgating : the *popular* @entity107 sports tradition of having a party in the parking lot prior to the game
not only was tailgating *banned* , there were only 13,000 parking spaces for @entity5 , a venue with 83,000 seats
