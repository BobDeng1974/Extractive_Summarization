a small rural primary school has organised a sleepover to @entity2 – so the children get a chance to see people who are not white			1
@entity6 in @entity7 was criticised by @entity8 for being insufficiently ‘ multicultural ’			1
so the 68 - pupil @entity10 school is asking parents to pay for their children to make a two - day trip to a school with a wide mix of ethnic backgrounds			1
idyllic : @entity19 in @entity7 the visit – described by one parent as patronising and bizarre – has been sold to parents as a way of boosting @entity6 ’s @entity8 grade from good to the top rating of outstanding			1
the school they are visiting , @entity28 in @entity28 , @entity2 – where three - quarters of the 410 pupils are from ethnic minorities – achieved the same good @entity8 rating			1
explaining the motivation for the trip , @entity33 headteacher @entity32 told parents in a letter : ‘ the purpose of this trip is to build up a relationship with a school in a very different community to ours			2
' this will enable our children to gain a better understanding of multicultural @entity48 , which was identified in our last @entity8 as being an area for development			0
‘ through our topics , visitors and discussions we have been developing multicultural awareness in both @entity48 and throughout the world , but this visit will help us to experience in real life a school where there is a wide mix of children with different ethnic backgrounds and almost 50 per cent of the children do not have @entity64 as their first language			2
’ the letter also explains that four teachers will accompany the children on the two - day trip , which will involve pupils sleeping in the @entity28 school and using its catering facilities , for an estimated cost of £ 35			1
while in @entity2 , the @entity7 children will engage in outdoor activities and record a cd			1
pupils from the school have written to their new pen - pals in @entity2 , some of whom will take part in a return visit to the school , near @entity85			1
mrs @entity32 ’s letter invites parents to a meeting to discuss the trip			2
but yesterday one mother said : ‘ i ’m astounded by this idea			0
just because the children go to a small school in the country does not mean they are n’t aware of people with different coloured skin to them			0
' it ’s very patronising – and for the school they are visiting too			2
' contrast : students will visit @entity28 school in @entity28 , @entity2 ‘ we are being asked to shell out £ 35 to try and boost their next @entity8 inspection			1
i think it ’s a very cynical approach			0
’ however , another parent supported the initiative , saying : ‘ i think it ’s a nice idea			0
‘ we do n’t live in an ethnically diverse area , so it ’s good for the kids to meet children from other kinds of background			0
’ in @entity28 , student @entity115 , 19 , who was picking up her two sisters up from @entity28 , said : ‘ they ’ve just told me about the sleepover and they ’re quite excited to meet other children from a different part of @entity122			2
it ’s good for them to learn about other cultures			0
’ @entity28 head @entity126 said the trip was organised with @entity6 because it places emphasis on outdoor learning			1
‘ the children will not be doing any cultural activities when they are here , ’ she said			0
the @entity133 , chairman of the governors at @entity33 , said : ‘ we are fairly mono - cultural as an area in @entity7 and we do n’t want children growing up thinking the whole world is full of trees and cows			2
this gives them an experience of urban living			0
’ mrs @entity32 said the trip , in which 29 pupils are taking part , was about providing an enriching experience for the children at both schools			1
‘ @entity7 is very quaint but our children do n’t get to see the big wide world , ’ she said			0
at @entity8 ’s last visit in 2010 , inspectors praised @entity6 as a ‘ happy place ’ but pointed out all the pupils were of ‘ white @entity48 heritage ’			1
their report recommended ‘ improving links with communities in contrasting parts of the @entity48 and abroad ’			0
last night @entity8 said at that time inspectors were required to report on the contribution made by the school to community cohesion , a requirement removed in 2011 .			0

@entity6 in @entity7 was criticised for not being multicultural
so visit *planned* to a school in @entity2 where most pupils are from minorities
@entity28 primary in @entity28 , @entity2 , will host 29 pupils
parents have called the £ 35 trip ' patronising ' - though others welcome it
