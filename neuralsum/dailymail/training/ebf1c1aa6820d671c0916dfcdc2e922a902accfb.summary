@entity0 are officially the worst team in the @entity1			1
so says the league table and , of course , that never lies			0
after sunday 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity6 , @entity0 are rock bottom of the league , having amassed only 11 points from 13 games			1
even their famous fans , who have stuck by the team throughout this nightmare season , have begun to boo and whistle their players			0
on sunday evening , director of sport @entity17 has conceded the club are ' in the middle of a relegation fight ' , but what are the reasons for @entity0 's downfall , and could they really find themselves in the second division in may ? the manager @entity27 has seemed ever more helpless in the past weeks , as he watched his team stumble from catastrophe to catastrophe			1
his job remains safe , and he insisted this weekend that he would n't resign , saying he takes ' full responsibility ' for his team 's woes			0
he has to say that , but it is difficult to ignore the errors he has made			0
he is now being accused of lacking a @entity47 @entity27 the motivator , meanwhile , has failed to exploit the successes in @entity50 and the victory against @entity52 in order to break his side 's psychological rut against smaller teams			1
he is still linked with jobs in the @entity58 or with the national team , but the longer the current crisis goes on , the more one asks : how much does anyone else really want him ? @entity27 is still linked with jobs in the @entity58 and with the national team amid the @entity0 crisis the players one of the reasons it has taken @entity0 fans so long to boo their team is because there has been no lack of effort on the part of the players			1
statistically , @entity0 have run more kilometers than any other team in the league , and they are clearly desperate to give the ' @entity78 ' which chief executive @entity79 demanded of them last week			1
injuries to @entity82 have kept @entity0 's best player out for most of the autumn injuries have kept their most magical player , @entity82 , out for most of the autumn , however , and the new signings are still yet to settle in			1
@entity87 has scored only six goals this season , and is struggling with the @entity27 system , while @entity92 winner @entity91 is having problems with the step up from @entity95			2
it was his mistake which cost @entity0 the first goal against @entity6 on sunday			1
@entity87 has scored only six goals this season for @entity0 and is struggling with the @entity27 system the playing style @entity27 's famous @entity101 , the art of pushing high up the pitch without the ball and striking ruthlessly in the transition , has been fine against teams like @entity107 , @entity52 and their @entity109 opponents			1
these teams attack more , and give @entity0 the space which they so love to exploit behind the defence			2
most of the worst defeats have come against theoretically inferior opposition , who have kept @entity0 out efficiently and mercilessly punished the endless mistakes at the back			2
@entity92 winner @entity91 ( right ) is having problems with the step up from @entity95 @entity91 is not alone in this regard – all of @entity0 's defenders have cost their team at one point or another through silly errors			2
if @entity27 is to fix this mess , he needs to adapt his playing style for defensive teams			2
at the moment , he seems unable to			0
@entity91 ( at the front ) is not alone – all of @entity0 's defenders have cost their team at one point through errors the results even with the sloppy defence , one thing is notable about all the nightmare results @entity0 have endured this year			2
they have not lost by more than two goals this year , and often have the lion 's share of the chances			2
defeats like the 2 - 1 against @entity142 , the 1 - 0 against @entity143 and the 2 - 0 against @entity144 could have been turned into victories if @entity0 had had a better conversion rate			1
the same could be said of the 2 - 2 draws against @entity147 and @entity148			1
once again , the likes of @entity87 and @entity41 have not been up to scratch as replacements for the injured @entity82 and the transferred @entity151			0
@entity27 's @entity0 are struggling to say the least this year as they sit bottom of the @entity1 the future it is now officially a relegation battle for @entity0			1
as @entity17 put it : ' until now , we 've kept an eye on how far we are from the top in terms of points			0
we can stop doing that now			0
' chief executive @entity79 told shareholders last week that one season out of the @entity109 would be no problem for @entity0 financially ; relegation , on the other hand , would be disastrous , both for the sporting and the financial sides of things			0
in terms of this season , the team needs to haul itself out of the relegation zone			0
@entity27 will stay , but he needs to make changes			0
@entity0 must pull themselves from the relegation zone in @entity178 as going down would be disastrous the team need more tactical clarity at the back , and potentially a better goalscorer come the january transfer window			0
there are enough poor teams in the @entity1 to think that @entity0 will not go down			1
they are still showing fight , and their @entity109 performances have shown that the side still has a lot of class			0
but changes are needed , and it 's not like there is n't a precedent for this			0
@entity196 were relegated as champions in 1969 ; @entity198 narrowly avoided relegation one year after reaching the @entity199 in 2002 , and @entity200 finished only 14th when they reached the semi finals in 2011			0
@entity0 's team walks to their fans after losing their latest @entity1 match against @entity6 @entity0 players face their supporters after their @entity1 defeat as they moved bottom of the league			1

@entity0 lost 2 - 0 against @entity6 on sunday
it moved @entity27 's men rock bottom of the @entity1
@entity0 won the league in 2012 , and were runners up in 2013 and 2014
