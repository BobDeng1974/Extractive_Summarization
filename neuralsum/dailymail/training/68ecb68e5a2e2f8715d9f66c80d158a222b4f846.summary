by @entity1 reporter published : 12:29 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 28 december 2012 deluded mothers are overfeeding their children because they are unable to tell if they are too chubby , new research suggests			1
a survey of nearly 300 mothers found they struggled to judge the weight of their own toddlers			1
experts say this blind spot can lead to the youngsters being encouraged to overeat , predisposing them to obesity in later life			0
deluded mothers are overfeeding their children because they are unable to tell if they are too chubby the study was carried out by dietitian @entity16 who asked 276 mothers to describe their 12 to 16 month old toddlers as either underweight , normal weight or overweight			1
the researchers then measured the children 's heights and weights			0
ms @entity16 said the mothers thought 27 of the children were too thin , but only one of these toddlers was actually underweight , with the rest a normal size			2
additionally , while 32 per cent of the toddlers in the study were actually overweight , only four per cent ( 12 of the 276 toddlers ) were perceived as too heavy by their mothers			1
ms @entity16 , of the @entity34 in @entity35 , said : ‘ mums are often worried their babies and toddlers are n't eating enough			2
‘ we put a lot of emphasis on weight gain in babies and toddlers as a measure of them doing well			1
‘ i think the perception in our society is that a chubby baby is a healthy baby and the chubbiness is something they 'll grow out of - but they do n't			0
‘ this sticks with them throughout childhood and they often end up overweight as an adult			0
new research has found that parents struggle to judge the weight of their own toddlers and so frequently overlook obesity problems she added : ‘ mums who are worried their child is not gaining enough weight , may pressure them to eat more or bribe them with dessert or treats			1
‘ this can teach children to ignore their own cues of hunger and fullness , inadvertently promoting overeating			0
’ figures show around 27 per cent of @entity79 children are now overweight			0
rapid early weight gain before two years of age is associated with a two to threefold increase in the risk of obesity later in life			1
ms @entity16 said parents are not given the support they need to understand normal child growth and how to pick up weight problems in their children			0
she said : ‘ serious prevention efforts need to start early in life to reverse the trend of increasing childhood obesity and set kids up for life - long good health			0
’ this research comes just after another survey which showed that sixty per cent of @entity79 toddlers are hooked on chocolate and sweets			2
it also revealed that one in three mothers admitted to dealing with fussy eaters by bribing them with a sweet treat and that 58 per cent of mothers believe that by the age of three , their child was already craving sugary snacks on a regular basis .			2

survey of mothers found mothers overfeed their children as they can not see they are too heavy
@entity35 research found 32 per cent of toddlers in the study were *fat* , but only four per cent were recognised by mothers as having a problem
rapid early weight gain before the age of two makes a child three times more likely to be obese later in life
