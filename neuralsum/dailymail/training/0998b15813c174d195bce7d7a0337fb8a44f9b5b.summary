professor dame @entity3 said that trying to start a family in their late 30s and early 40s would reduce women ’s chance of conception and could increase the medical risks			1
she went on to say : ‘ the steady shift to have children later , there are issues with that			2
we all assume we can have children later but actually we may not be able to			2
’ she also expressed concern that ‘ many more women ’ are choosing not to have children			1
figures from the @entity32 show that 20 per cent of women now reach the age of 45 without having children – twice the proportion than the previous generation , born in 1945			1
professor @entity38 insisted that she was not suggesting women should have children earlier , saying : ‘ it ’s not for me to tell women what to do			1
’ but she pointed out that it was a well - known fact that fertility declines as women get older			0
dame @entity38 , who earns more than £ 225,000 a year as the government ’s top medical adviser , also said that breastfeeding should be an accepted part of everyday office life – even in meetings			1
addressing an event organised by the @entity55 charity in @entity56 yesterday , @entity38 , 64 , said that one way of boosting women ’s prospects in the workplace would be by encouraging them to breastfeed at work			1
she then talked candidly about the time that she shocked male colleagues when she attempted to breastfeed her daughter during a meeting			0
speaking of the need to make breastfeeding more ‘ acceptable ’ , she said : ‘ i was there in this giant shirt with a baby hiding under it and a comment was made and my response was quite sharp			2
’ @entity38 – a consultant specialising in blood disorders – also said women doctors were currently ‘ underestimated , ’ poorly paid and far less likely to be in positions of power compared to men			1
and she used her speech to try to encourage the @entity80 to do more to ensure that women can ‘ make it up the ladder ’			0
over the last decade the number of female doctors has increased by 50 per cent and by 2022 they are expected to outnumber men for the first time			0
but as many only work part - time to look after children , concerns have been raised that it has led to staffing shortages and gaps on the rota			2
@entity38 said the country ought to learn how to accept breastfeeding in the workplace and make it a normal issue rather than a feminist one			1
file image only this week @entity102 , chief executive of the @entity104 think - tank , said an increase of women doctors was partly to blame for a current shortage of @entity109 medics			0
but @entity38 , who also has two grown - up daughters , said : ‘ i ’m getting very bored with being one of the only women in the room			1
‘ women are underestimated across the medical profession			0
‘ breastfeeding has increased in the @entity117 , steadily but it is not increasing enough			0
‘ but how do we make it more acceptable in the workplace			0
‘ how do we make it more accessible for women to breastfeed their child without making it a feminist issue and instead making it a normal issue			0
’ she went on to call for equal pay for male and female doctors , saying : ‘ women doctors are underestimated in senior positions			0
‘ you would still however expect women working in medicine to get the same salaries			0
’ in august dame @entity38 revealed that she had experimented with cannabis two or three times whilst at university but stopped after suffering hallucinations .			2

she warned the chance of conception reduces in late 30s and early 40s
she is concerned ' many more women ' are choosing to have no children
@entity32 figures show 20 per cent of women now reach 45 with no children
@entity38 also said breastfeeding should be more ' acceptable ' at work
