it got off to an uncertain start , with viewers complaining of dull , confusing plot lines			1
and it seems things have gone from bad to worse for @entity9 ’s new drama @entity7 , after it lost one million viewers in the space of a week			1
wednesday night ’s episode , which was the second instalment of the @entity14 drama , drew an average of 2.89 million viewers , down from the 3.89 million who tuned in to watch episode one			1
praise : while viewers have been left in the dark by the complicated political plot , cast members such as @entity32 - who plays king @entity33 - have earned praise for their powerful performances @entity47 historian @entity46 used @entity48 to share background notes throughout the episode , including : ‘ one of @entity33 ’s courtiers , sir @entity52 , really did lose an eye while jousting			1
’ responding to questions about @entity33 ’s tangerine robes , she wrote : ‘ @entity33 did like the colour - ordered more orange garments in 1530s & 1540s			2
’ however her expertise could n’t help some of the more confused muddle through			2
taking to the social media site , one viewer wrote : ‘ @entity7 is proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep , the @entity61 really did n’t say much ! ’ ‘ can not understand the love around @entity7			1
painfully slow and dull , ’ wrote another , while a third posted : ‘ @entity7 is so confusing			2
’ the @entity9 spent £ 7million making @entity7 , which is based on @entity69 ’s award - winning novel and charts the rise of @entity23 from blacksmith ’s son to one of the most powerful men in @entity33 ’s court			1

directed by @entity82 , adapting the text involved condensing nearly 700 pages into six one - hour episodes – helped by a combination of flashbacks and jumps forward			2
author : @entity69 , who won the @entity89 for the novel in 2009 however , while this might help fit more of @entity94 ’s vision of @entity14 on the screen , some audience members were left less impressed			0
and despite becoming @entity9 ’s most successful new drama for a decade when it began last week , it was met with complaints from viewers who complained the structure was hard to follow			1
one @entity48 user wrote : ‘ thinking about @entity7 ; know my history , loved the books but still found the chopping and changing of the time line slightly confusing			1
’ and another said : ‘ @entity7 ? confusing use of “ he ” for any 4 or 5 folk at a time , non-linear timeline , stupidly long convos & snail ’s pace action			0
’ others felt their lack of knowledge of @entity14 history left them at a disadvantage when watching the programme			0
in one sequence , @entity23 lost his wife and daughters to the mysterious ‘ sweating sickness ’			0
the disease , which is still not fully understood , struck @entity123 and later @entity124 in a series of epidemics between 1485 and 1551			0
speculation of its causes at the time included people ’s sins , spells , and the @entity134			0
although the disease does not exist today and is therefore rarely talked about , no time was spent giving audiences this context			0
one viewer wrote : ‘ what is sweating sickness ? they were n’t feeling unwell the day before			0
must be able to equate it to modern day illness			0
’ and another joked : ‘ a dose of the sweating sickness would have been a blessed relief during @entity7			0

complicated drama *leaves* viewers perplexed by political *plotline*
praise for powerful performances by stars @entity22 and @entity32
historian @entity46 tries to help by *explaining* all on @entity48
but the £ 7million show frustrates many and is described by one as ' dull '
another says drama is ' proving to be a sure fire way to send me to sleep '
