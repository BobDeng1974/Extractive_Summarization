@entity1 ’s lavish spending has not finished			1
in january another £ 50million has been allocated to sign more players in the wake of this summer ’s £ 150m - plus spending spree which culminated in the signing of @entity6			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 remain top targets			1
@entity11 will be sold in january to accommodate a second wave of rebuilding under manager @entity13			1
@entity1 would accept a sale in the region of £ 20m			1
it is said do n’t judge a book by its cover			2
but the weird front image of a new biography about @entity32 suggests otherwise			2
i ca n’t think of a worse , more unflattering picture i have ever seen of @entity32 who remains @entity38 ’s only @entity37 - winning captain and who was an inspiration to a generation			2
the image makes @entity38 ’s original golden boy look more like an east @entity44 gangster of the @entity45 than an icon of whom @entity47 said was the best , and most handsome , @entity50 footballer he had ever seen or played against			2
maybe though that was the point : to depict @entity32 as an enigma rather than an icon of his time			2
controversial : a new biography of @entity32 ( left ) features an unusual image of the football icon mon : on transfer deadline day @entity1 seal the signing of @entity6 on a loan deal			1
a few days earlier @entity1 had no interest or involvement in signing the @entity63 from @entity64			1
tue : the transfer window is briefly re-opened to accommodate @entity1 offloading @entity15 to @entity66			1
seems like big club caveats to me			2
wed : @entity69 sums up @entity38 's dire 1 - 0 win over @entity71 with such a bad pass that would have made @entity74 flinch			2
thur : @entity38 boss @entity75 gets angry with a press pack that have not only supported him but given him an easy ride			2
i feel he ’s had a crack at two tournaments so should go especially now that he is blaming everyone but himself for @entity38 banality			2
fri : a book is launched aimed at tarnishing the reputation of @entity32			2
@entity86 the formation of the @entity88 which has taken the place of reserve football has been hailed as a way of improving the standard of young players coming through			1
it is essentially an under 21 team but can accommodate three over age players usually if they are coming back from injury			2
last monday i went to watch @entity101 host @entity99 at their training ground in @entity103			2
i have to say i was underwhelmed			1
there is a lot of talk about how more sophisticated training techniques and tactics under coaches with an attache case full of badges and @entity113 presentations is improving the game			2
but there was little evidence of that			0
sadly i came away with the distinct impression that players are being drilled like robots and constrained with the parameters of whatever the latest fad formation happens to be			0
4 - 3 - 3 morphing into 4 - 5 - 1 has become popular over the last couple of seasons and both @entity101 and @entity99 played that way			0
they both set out to pass the ball out from the back bit more often than not when a route was closed down the ball went back then forward with a long hopeful ball			1
the main reason ? not one player on either side was prepared to dribble past an opponent or two thus opening up the game and allowing a passing cycle to continue and set up a chance			1
and while both teams had wide men none were wingers in the conventional sense			0
and it does n’t matter how many times someone re-writes the coaching manual ; wingers with pace , tricky and good crossing change games to break through two sets of back four who able to rely on physical and rugged defending in a match @entity99 eventually won 1 - 0			0
the other problem is that the formations were too rigid			0
people make the mistake that 4 - 4 - 2 , for the time being outdated , has been the root of the problem for @entity50 football especially at international level			1
it has n’t per se			0
the problem has been that too many teams , especially @entity38 , play a far too rigid 4 - 4 - 2 , with the flat lines			0
when the lines are blurred , when there is flexibility 4 - 4 - 2 can be as fluid as many formation			0
coaches have got to start giving players freedom of expression and conscious of doing the right thing and staying in their zone but even at this level and at most clubs there is pressure to get results			0
so actually it seems there is more emphasis on success rather than development than there was in the days when the stepping stone to the first team was the reserves			0
talent : @entity192 ( above ) has failed to secure a move to @entity1 i am hearing one of the country ’s best young players , @entity192 , has failed to secure a move to @entity1 because of complications over a compensation fee from parent club @entity200 , with whom he has been with since the age of 10			1
left back @entity192 , 16 , is also wanted by @entity66 but as it stands the potential ' new @entity204 ' is ready to commit himself to the @entity200 for the next two years			1
but @entity192 has been contacted by the @entity206 @entity205 ( his grandmother was born in @entity208 ) about declaring his nation allegiance to them and has also has offers from @entity212 and @entity213			1
i am also hearing it is now being reported that @entity215 is ready to re-join @entity1 next summer			1
regular readers of this column will know @entity219 revealed last summer how close @entity215 was to going back to @entity1			1
after long discussions @entity215 ’s advisors decided it was best to get a new mega-deal with @entity20			1
going back ? @entity215 ( pictured ) could be ready to re-join @entity1 but come next summer @entity215 could be swayed by @entity1 ’s new ' @entity225 ' recruiting policy			1
the key could be @entity6 moving on from his loan with @entity1 to @entity20 , whom he wanted to join last week			1
in that respect such a deal would happen if super agent @entity231 wants it to happen			0
@entity231 currently represents @entity215 and @entity6			1
it is understood that @entity234 and his company earned nearly 5m euros for the deal that took @entity6 to @entity1 , the player having been touted about to @entity237 , @entity239 @entity238 and @entity240			1
bid spender : @entity1 manager @entity13 ( above ) is looking to spend more transfer cash in january big money : the @entity246 winger ( right ) could be swayed by @entity248 's new ' @entity225 ' recruiting policy @entity249 in a fortnight it will be ten years since @entity251 died			1
it was no secret that in latter years of his managerial career that an alcohol problem affected his life			0
sometimes it made @entity251 hard work for those around him			0
but those of who grew up watching football in the @entity264 will never forget the two wonderful football sides he nurtured organically at @entity267 and @entity268			1
a club like @entity268 winning two @entity271 cups with a cavalier style of football ? icon : it 's hard to disagree with those that say @entity251 was the best manager @entity38 never had you did n’t have to be a @entity268 fan to cheer them on and be enthralled by how they played			1
and how for so long @entity251 ’s inspiration kept @entity268 punching way above their weight even when financial muscle started to control who could win titles and cups			0
then of course there were @entity251 ’s outspoken tirades			0
i still feel had @entity293 not @entity292 succeeded sir @entity294 , @entity251 would have got the best out of mercurial players such as @entity297 , @entity298 , or @entity299 , and a bit later @entity301 and @entity302 , and maybe won ( or at least qualified for ! ) the 1978 or 1982 @entity37			0
it ’s often said that @entity251 was the best manager @entity38 never had			0
it ’s hard to disagree			0
btw is n’t it funny how so many people are now lamenting the fact that the @entity38 team does n’t have the option of a ' young ' @entity311 and @entity312 playing in tandem			0
three @entity314 : are @entity38 missing @entity312 ( left ) and @entity311 ( right ) ? @entity315 if you are wondering why @entity38 ’s match against @entity319 is on a monday night it 's because it is part of @entity322 ’s money orientated plan to spread @entity325 qualifiers over the weekend to pocket more tv revenue			0
but as it stands more and more people are losing the appetite to watch @entity38 and i ca n’t see a monday night slot helping			0
why not in future just give the captain ’s armband to the player who has the most caps at the start of the game ? as it stands that is @entity341			2
but from now on the position should be a symbol of seniority			0
not some sort of sinecure			0
@entity347 @entity38 are 2 - 1 to beat @entity319			0
i think it will be a 1 - 1 draw which is 5 - 1			0
coral offer 33 - 1 for @entity351 to be top scorer .			0

@entity1 target january spending spree
@entity11 set to be sold as @entity13 eyes @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9
@entity215 could also return to @entity359 next summer
i was underwhelmed by football in the @entity88
talented *youngster* @entity192 is ready to commit his future to @entity200 after @entity1 move falls through
