click here for the latest leaderboard from the @entity3 @entity2 @entity4 and @entity5 clearly enjoyed their duel at @entity8 so much they have decided to conduct an encore at the @entity2 at @entity10			1
the only difference this time is it ’s the @entity13 who is doing the chasing as the @entity17 ’s welcome revival continued			0
on friday , @entity5 shot one of the rounds of the year , a stunning 61 featuring seven birdies to finish			1
it ’s never easy coming back the next day after such a performance and particularly when the round is interrupted for more than three hours owing to a storm delay			0
both players had just three holes to complete when it came , with @entity5 a healthy five shots ahead			1
but the lead is now a much more precarious three strokes after the @entity50 birdied his last two holes upon the resumption for a 66 to give the tournament an entirely different complexion and set up what promises to be an enthralling finale on sunday			0
there ’s plenty at stake for @entity4			1
if he wins he can become world number one again , but only if present incumbent @entity61 finishes outside the top five			0
the @entity63 just happens to be joint fourth after a 65 of his own and clearly has no intention of giving up his crown			0
‘ i ’m playing really well so it promises to be an exciting day , ’ said @entity69 , who is a phenomenal 28 under par for his last seven rounds			2
‘ @entity5 chased me down at @entity73 and now it ’s my turn to chase him			1
’ raindrops keep falling on my head : @entity4 walks across the fairway with an umbrella challenger : @entity4 is second , five shots off the pace , and is looking to add to his @entity8 title weather : @entity4 ( in the red trousers ) walks across the bridge on the 16th hole as the tournament is delayed hopes : @entity92 @entity91 is six shots behind on eight - under - par as he searches for his third win in four alongside @entity61 and @entity39 @entity95 at six off the pace is @entity91 , meaning that four of the world ’s top five are where they need to be on the leaderboard of the year			1
even the one player missing , third - ranked @entity103 , is not completely out of it in 8th place			2
as for @entity5 , if he could pull off his first @entity3 ( @entity3 ) win , it would be his 9th victory on the @entity110 , and would tie him with none other than @entity112 and sir @entity113 for most wins by a @entity41 player since 1970			1
meanwhile , of the players on the fringe of a @entity119 place for both sides , only @entity95 is really doing his cause a world of good			2
if there was any doubt he would get a wild card if he needs one , it has surely ended here			0
struggle : defending champion @entity25 has yet to find his form an is 15 shots of the pace on one - over - par @entity131 : woods was heard swearing at the cameras after a poor shoot on the sixth hole in @entity38 as for @entity92 ’s struggling trio , @entity136 , clinging on to the 9th and last automatic spot as we enter the final month of qualifying , is well down the field and so will not be strengthening his grip , although he will be grateful that @entity143 @entity142 , presently 10th , is not taking advantage after three ordinary rounds of his own			1
@entity146 came here desperate for a big week after missing four halfway cuts in a row but while he is trending in the right direction , rounds of 72,71 and 70 have left him stranded in the middle of the pack			0
even worse off is @entity154 , whose disappointing year continues			0
let ’s hope a return to @entity157 for the @entity158 next week brings a shift of narrative			0
it was there in 2008 that a @entity119 career that has seen him win an incredible 11 of his last 12 matches really took off			2
desire : @entity25 needs to finish well in the next two tournaments if he hopes to qualify for the @entity168			2

@entity5 finished on 14 - under - par , three shots clear of the field
@entity4 on 11 - under and @entity173 on nine - under
@entity92 @entity91 and @entity39 @entity95 on eight - under
defending champion @entity25 is 15 shots off the pace on one - over - par
