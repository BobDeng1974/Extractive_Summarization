his comments may cause some anxiety for the programme ’s current team of presenters			2
the weekly show is normally fronted by former @entity45 footballer @entity44 , 53 , who is paid £ 1.5million - a - year for his services			0
he is often paired with his former teammate @entity47 , 43 , and retired @entity49 player @entity48 , 58 , and they are frequently joined by a string of other white male pundits , including @entity53 , 38 , and @entity54 , 34			0

others , it was like pushing water up a hill and we kept saying it , and it was n’t happening			0
‘ we got to the point where we thought , this is not acceptable anymore , this does n’t reflect the world we live in			0
