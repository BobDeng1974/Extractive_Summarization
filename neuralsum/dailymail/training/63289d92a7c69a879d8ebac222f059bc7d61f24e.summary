pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the plans secondary schools would be required to teach pupils in sets according to ability under plans being considered by the @entity10			1
they would be penalised for teaching mixed - ability groups for key subjects under controversial proposals to make sets effectively compulsory			1
the idea is being considered for inclusion in the 2015 @entity17 manifesto			1
it would build on the policy blueprint in 2010 , which pledged to ‘ encourage setting so those who are struggling get extra help and the most able are stretched ’			0
one report claimed @entity25 was pushing for the policy to be announced sooner and had even booked a venue for a launch			0
but education secretary @entity29 insisted in the @entity30 there was ‘ absolutely no truth ’ in the ‘ rumours ’			1
she said political opponents had a ‘ rather unhealthy interest sometimes in speculating about what i am or am not about to announce ’			0
in an interview she added : ' it ’s not something i am looking at			0
' both @entity42 and the @entity10 have long supported setting but stopped short of making it compulsory			0
however last year the head of @entity46 called for greater use of sets from age 11 to ensure the brightest pupils reach their potential			2
figures suggest the practice of separating children into ability groups does not become widespread until children are 14			2
even among older children , not all schools use ability groups in core subjects			1
@entity46 ’s sir @entity61 said : ' i ’d set from the word go ( in secondary schools )			1
' too many non-selective schools are failing to nurture scholastic excellence			2
’ sources said the idea was ‘ under discussion ’ and part of the ‘ policy debate at the moment ’			0
while in opposition @entity73 called for a ‘ grammar stream ’ in every subject in all comprehensives			1
education secretary @entity29 ( left ) denied claims the plans would be included in the 2015 @entity17 manifesto			1
@entity73 ( right ) called for a ' grammar stream ' in every subject in all comprehensives he said : ‘ i want to see setting in every single school			1
’ it was claimed yesterday mr @entity73 ’s advisers had drawn up plans for a compulsory setting policy			2
a source close to @entity94 , the @entity95 schools minister , said : ‘ this has not been agreed with the @entity95 and is not government policy			0
' we do n’t believe it would be appropriate to tie schools ’ hands in this way			0
’ and @entity103 , general secretary of the @entity104 , said : ‘ this is an area for teachers to decide and for results to speak for themselves			0
’ @entity108 published two years ago by the @entity109 showed a higher proportion of ‘ low - achieving pupils ’ in each class had a ‘ negative and significant effect on the academic achievements of regular pupils ’ because they monopolised teachers ’ attention			0
the announcement of the plans comes as teachers have been told to consider using seating plans to split up troublemakers and stop pupils choosing to sit with friends .			2

plans may be included in 2015 @entity17 manifesto , sources say
all key subjects in secondary schools would be grouped by pupils ' ability
@entity73 called for a ' grammar stream ' in ' every single school '
education secretary @entity29 denied claims plans would be included
