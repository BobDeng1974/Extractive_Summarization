maybe it is the location , something in the air			2
@entity4 bonito , and all that			0
no country wants to come to a @entity6 in @entity7 , the spiritual home of football at its most compelling , and stink the place out			0
that applies to @entity11 more than most			1
after a dismal experience in @entity13 in 2010 and a week of predictions based around a dour , goalless draw , played at an @entity18 snail ’s pace in the tropical heat , @entity11 came out of the blocks in @entity21 as if set down at @entity22 on a perfect autumn afternoon			1
lost , obviously , but that happens in football			0
sometimes you do n’t get what you deserve			0
a fair few in the squad know all about that this season			0
@entity43 has arrived at this tournament with a battle - plan based around a sprightly , youthful , forward line , and must stick to it in @entity48 on thursday			1
defeat and @entity11 will be as good as out , but @entity43 can not afford to think like that			1
to play @entity51 and @entity52 minus an element of risk would invite disaster ; a draw that would put incredible pressure on a final win over @entity59 or the breakaway goal that might seal @entity11 ’s fate in the shortest time possible			1
for @entity51 coach @entity63 to play @entity52 may be a gamble after rushing his return from injury , but have no doubt that he can score			1
he is a streetfighter and a street footballer with a desire that borders on insanity			0
the best way to put him , and @entity51 , out of business is to focus on a creaking , vulnerable defence that leaked three to @entity59			1
late run : @entity78 has come from virtually nowhere to be a major threat for @entity11 @entity43 ’s strategy out here as good as decides itself — embrace the spirit of @entity7 , or bust			1
could we see more of him ? @entity88 could be an alternative should @entity11 want to attack @entity11 ’s back line , sadly , is not set up to hold a lead			1
had it been @entity36 , not @entity92 , that had scored with a far post header in the 50th minute on saturday , @entity11 would not have been able to see the game out with the certainty that @entity35 did			1
@entity97 ’s players reverted to type once that goal went in , a bank of five in front of a fortress of four , as thick as tar through the middle , and @entity11 could find no way through			1
@entity105 missed a good chance in the second half and @entity108 had a free - kick saved but as the game wore on genuine threats to goal grew fewer , as @entity35 ’s vice grip got tighter and , if anything , they looked likelier to snatch a third on the break			1
trading blows in front of goal the teams were evenly matched			0
what was clear , however , is that a plan of containment that was so effective in @entity123 for @entity43 will not fly for long out here			1
@entity11 must play to their strengths and if this makes contests more open than is traditionally considered healthy , so be it			1
despite his protestations to the contrary , @entity43 is not a natural cavalier			1
@entity132 supplemented @entity133 in the qualifying matches only when backs were to the wall and @entity78 ’s run into the first - team could not have been timed any later			0
yet , like most coaches of experience , he is a pragmatist — and sometimes the most pragmatic means of defence is attack			2
wide of the mark : @entity105 missed a golden chance and did not look comfortable on the wing why do @entity149 play as they do , and @entity150 ? it is simple			0
what other option do they have ? @entity149 manager @entity155 says he would never send a team out to suck the life from the game as @entity159 did at @entity22 last season but the fact is , he could n’t if he wished to			0
not with @entity149 ’s defence			2
if he ever gets a rearguard as reliable as his forwards — or as rugged as @entity159 ’s — we shall see how loyal he is to those principles			2
for all the talk of a @entity149 way , their greatest teams under @entity171 , for instance , were not known for flying into away fixtures gung - ho			0
they could hold a lead as well as any collection of @entity179 , because they possessed some of @entity183 ’s greatest defenders — @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , and plenty more			2
ahead of them @entity189 protected the yard as fiercely as any doberman on a chain			0
@entity150 under @entity194 were the same			0
@entity195 values winning beautifully and so there has been disproportionate focus on the front of the team in his tenure			0
the last time @entity150 defended for their lives was on the way to the @entity204 final in 2006			0
since then they have been gorgeously one - dimensional ; but , then , they have to be			0
picking up the pace : @entity208 was part of @entity11 's front four against @entity35 this is true of @entity11 , too			1
@entity43 picks the best back four available — notwithstanding the moot debate over @entity213 and @entity108 , and the closed door that is @entity215 — but he will know deep down that it does not pass muster against the best attacking units here			1
it would be very dangerous indeed to imagine @entity11 could play a cautious game against @entity51 , nick a goal and sit on that lead			1
no time to change it : @entity43 must stick with the bold , attacking approach the onslaught that started the match with @entity35 is undoubtedly the way to go once more			1
@entity11 must continue to make a virtue of the confidence of youth , the pace and technical ambition that came so close to establishing a significant lead in @entity21			1
going into sunday ’s games , @entity11 topped the 14 - team table for shots at goal			2
@entity240 accuracy is the key			0
if that is achieved , @entity51 will not withstand			2
if anything , they are considerably more vulnerable at the back than @entity11			1
there is another reason to get on the front foot			0
at the last @entity6 , of the 16 teams eliminated at the group stage , 14 failed to win their first game			0
nine of those lost and five drew			0
only @entity253 and @entity254 won and went out			0
the numbers after game two are even more worrying			0
only three teams made it to round two without recording a victory in the opening two matches : @entity11 ( two draws ) , @entity262 ( two draws ) and @entity263 ( draw , defeat )			2
@entity43 can not rely on his players getting so lucky again			2
‘ we are not the type of team to sit back and , unfortunately , that left one or two opportunities for @entity35 to get the ball in , ’ said @entity43			1
that will be true against @entity51 , too			2
it is scarcely believable that @entity52 will not fashion at least one opportunity in front of goal , even half fit			2
@entity11 ’s mission is to render this moment an irrelevance			2
there is only one way to achieve that			0
more of the same and let the best team win			0
play your own game : @entity11 have to try to ensure any appearance by @entity52 is irrelevant			1

@entity11 came out of the blocks fast against @entity35 in @entity21
@entity43 must keep faith in his *system* based around young forwards
if @entity11 lose to @entity51 ( and possibly @entity52 ) they *'ll* be out
they must target @entity51 's creaking , leaky defence
@entity43 's back line is not set up to keep a lead
