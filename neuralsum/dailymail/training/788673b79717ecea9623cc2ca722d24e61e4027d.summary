it was a performance to set a new high watermark on what you can legitimately expect from a footballer returning after one of the most brutally debilitating injuries imaginable			0
fifty - six minutes into @entity8 ’s cup tie with minnows @entity9 , @entity12 ’s accidental collision with @entity13 brought @entity8 ’ chunky little barrel of talent and fun , @entity17 , back to the promised land			1
the concussed @entity19 exited groggily and the stocky @entity20 burst back on to the scene eight months after his own unfortunate collision with a @entity19 — @entity24 ’s @entity23 — ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee			2
@entity17 returned to the @entity8 side after a knee injury kept him out since march no comparison is precise but - during the previous 27 matches of the 21 - year - old ’s debut season , producing eight goals - there were hints of @entity36 ’s extraordinary blend of power and technique at a juvenile age , plus delicate flavours of the cheek , love of life and showmanship of the young @entity44			1
whether this kid , who himself had produced a kid before he even played first - team football ( little @entity17 ) , and who is already through the ‘ musical differences ’ break - up in the first part of his budding pop career , can reach the same eights as @entity57 or @entity36 remains to be seen			1
he may have been missing from saturday night ’s 3 - 0 win at home to @entity60 — which saw real equal a @entity63 record 18th - straight victory in all competitions and @entity65 complete his 23rd treble with his 200th @entity63 top - flight goal , giving him more hat - tricks than any other @entity70 player — yet he has talent in abundance			2
the @entity8 fans celebrate @entity17 's return to action which takes us back to tuesday night and the paroxysms of joy into which the 50,000 crowd were sent by their returning prodigy			1
after a missed touch here and a twinge there , he produced the ‘ nutmeg ’ of the @entity90 season			2
miles better than @entity92 the other weekend for @entity93			0
@entity17 drew @entity94 to him , turned his back on the defender so that — unlike @entity92 — he could n’t even see his opponent or his stance then , ‘ blind ’ , used the instep of his right boot to chop the ball between @entity94 ’s legs before running around the player to regain possession			1
the @entity106 has seen some things in its time , but the ghosts of @entity65 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 joined in the ooohing , aaahhing and ‘ olé - ing ’ which the trick drew from the crowd			2
that @entity17 crashed in a rightfooted goal from @entity120 ’s assist to make the final score 5 - 0 was n’t just icing on the cake			1
one of the things which sets the pulse running about this buzz - bomb is that , despite the fact that technical ability and a taste for the spectacular both ooze out of his pores , he ’s no show - pony			2
dedicated to winning , properly focused on elbowing his way into the @entity8 first team and staying there , he ’s a scamp			1
there ’s a bit of the @entity138 about him , but he plays to win rather than to dazzle			0
@entity17 has been likened to @entity141 's @entity36 @entity17 has shown similarities to @entity44 in the way he plays even at the age of 21 , this injury has been a massively costly setback for the kid from the @entity148 — and for the teams he ’d have played for			1
it cost him a @entity153 winners ’ medal and a @entity155 medal — having previously contributed to @entity8 ’s trajectory to the finals , he lost the pride of playing in the showpiece matches against @entity160 and @entity161			1
real , too , lost out			0
their title stumble came , in sight of the tape , when just two more goals — at home to @entity168 and away to @entity169 — would have given them four more points			2
enough to win the title , meaning that they would also have won their first ever @entity174			0
would @entity17 have guaranteed those late season goals when others , older than him , were tired and creaky ? maybe not			1
was his season shaping up to write that kind of script ? yes			0
so explosive was his form , socontagious his @entity181 of goals ( scoring from four different positions , left wing , right wing , centre - forward and no 10 ) that , by early winter 2013 , @entity187 was raising the idea of taking him to @entity190 ’s defence of their @entity191			1
there is a lot of excitement around @entity17 's return from injury might @entity190 have been better off with a lad exuding burgeoning confidence , dancing past opponents and scoring outrageous goals ? answers on a postcard			1
of course , there was another cost			0
within a couple of weeks of his first operation , in @entity19 , a nasty infection set in and a second operation was needed			0
the coach who had been most influential in @entity17 ’s development was @entity213 — now sacked from his job in charge of @entity216			1
@entity213 suffered this injury himself , twice , while a player and spent much of the summer helping the youngster cope with the psychological trauma it brings			0
‘ knee - ligament injuries are n’t just damaging physically , but mentally , too , ’ @entity213 noted			1
‘ you go through huge ups and downs , times when the healing goes quickly and times when there seems to be no prospect of advances			0
over the months , i ’ve managed to help him keep his equilibrium			0
’ during those months , his house went on fire and he had to move in next door with @entity239			0
also , @entity17 ’s pop group , @entity241 , broke up			2
he ’s now a solo artist who wants to go by the soubriquet of ‘ @entity243 ’			0
some of his @entity245 confidence comes from the fact that , in @entity17 ’s first five seasons at the club , he won five straight leagues and became a @entity90 champion with @entity190 at under - 19 level			1
he has the winning habit and knows what it takes to be a champion			0
some grim days recently in @entity63 football — offset and lightened by the return of a phenomenal young buck			0
someone who carries the very essence of football in his soul and in his boots .			0

@entity17 made his return to the @entity8 team after being out with a knee injury
the 21 - year - old scored eight goals in 27 games in his debut season
@entity17 has been compared to @entity44 and @entity36
