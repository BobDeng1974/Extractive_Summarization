by @entity0 - parkinson published : 10:41 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 20 april 2012 lets hope the real event is a little bit more exciting and attracts bigger crowd			2
a full dress rehearsal for the @entity7 torch relay got under way today - but only handfuls of people turned out to watch the spectacle and there was n't even a flame on the torch			1
some 122 participants from @entity16 were acting as torchbearers during the only full operational dummy run of a single day of the relay			2
torchbearer @entity20 sets off with the torch during a rehearsal from the @entity23 in @entity24 whether this woman in the village @entity25 knew the torch was passing through or if she witnessed it by chance is unknown it 's unlikely that these police bikers would be needed during the @entity35 torch relay dummy - run the actual torch relay will start from @entity37 in @entity38 next month after the arrival of the @entity35 flame in the @entity41 on may 18			1
today 's rehearsal , taking place on the @entity24 to @entity45 route , is aimed at testing timings , convoy movement , radio communications , traffic management and security			1
the torch will not be lit during the rehearsal , the organisers said			2
the actual @entity35 flame will pass through 1,018 places in the @entity41 , as well as visiting @entity56 , arriving in @entity57 for the @entity35 opening ceremony on july 27			1
bearers of the flameless @entity35 torch made their way along the route through @entity16 this afternoon today 's rehearsal kicked off at the @entity23 in @entity24 just after 7am			1
each of the participants , who have been chosen from the local area to take part in today 's rehearsal , will carry the torch some 300m			1
the participants are volunteers from local universities and organisations , but will not be taking part in the actual event			2
the @entity74 is due to pass along the route on day 46 of the torch relay			1
speaking ahead of today 's rehearsal , @entity77 , a @entity78 student , said he was excited to be taking part as one of the acting torchbearers			1
the 20 - year - old , who is in his second year of a sports management degree , said ' i would have liked to have been involved in the real thing but i was n't sure i was going to be in the country			2
this is a great opportunity to still be involved			0
' it 's something you take forward with you for the rest of your life			2
' another student , @entity91 , 23 , who is in her final year of a physics degree at the university , said she had been nervous about dropping the torch			0
' i was initially quite worried about it because of how heavy the torch was going to be and anyone i mentioned it to said ' oh what if you dropped it ' , but now i 've had chance to hold it , it 's actually very light and easy to hold			1
' @entity105 , chairman of the @entity106 , spoke to some of the participants taking part in today 's rehearsal during a handover at @entity78			1
@entity105 , who represented the university during his time studying economics and social history there , said the day would help to ensure they were ' as close to perfection ' as possible for the actual event			0
the @entity121 - winning athlete said : ' we 've got different modes of transport			0
we 've got the torch travelling on a boat , we 've got it travelling by train , we 've obviously got the torchbearers themselves			0
even at @entity78 there was a lack of people on the side of the route lacking spark : @entity20 passes the ' flame to @entity138 during the test run security outrunners gather in @entity24			1
they will follow the torch in teams around the @entity41 @entity144 takes the torch along another empty road - hopefully the real relay will attract larger crowds ' it was just a good way of testing it			1
it 's like 122 mini dress rehearsals involving 12 different communities and 80 miles			0
' we 'll collate all the learnings of the course of the day and take them back to @entity157 and look at it all			0
this is no different from every other aspect of the @entity35 we 're testing			1
' we 're into 400,000 hours of technology testing , we 've got 11 test events still left to do in sport			0
' i 've sat on the kerbstones of roads at 5.45 in the morning talking to marathon runners about the test event for the marathon			0
' we just learn and refine so that we can get as close to perfection as we possibly can			0
' when asked about security concerns , @entity105 said he was confident people were looking to celebrate rather than disrupt the relay			0
police officers who will guard the @entity35 torch as it travels across the country sit on a train at great central station in @entity24 @entity105 turned up for part of the relay as it passed to @entity182 in @entity183 another couple of torch relay runners pass the imaginary flame as the torch reaches @entity78 @entity188 carries the torch along a near empty platform in @entity24 he said : ' you can hear the music and the excitement in the background			1
i 'm just delighted that we 've got the opportunity to take the torch to within 10 miles of 57 million people			0
' i do n't believe that there is any appetite to do anything other than really want to celebrate the torch relay			0
' from the university , the rehearsal team was due to travel through @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 in @entity211			0
at @entity213 , a torchbearer will be carried across the water on a rigid inflatable boat ( @entity216 ) to hand over the torch to a participant on another boat			0
from there , the party will travel on to @entity222 and @entity223 before torchbearers board another steam train on the @entity226 to @entity228 station to end the day in @entity45 .			2
