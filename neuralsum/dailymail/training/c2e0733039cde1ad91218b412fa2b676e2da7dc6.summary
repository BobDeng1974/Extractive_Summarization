i wonder if @entity1 was true to his word at 10.30 on saturday night ? in the trailer announcing the arrival of the fiftieth anniversary season of @entity8 , @entity4 ’s new centre half says that as soon as he hears the show ’s iconic theme tune , he drops everything and heads for the telly			1
or perhaps this weekend , after his debut for his new team that siren song actually sounded more like the theme from @entity18 ? and saw @entity19 ’s finest getting out of earshot , and sharpish ! because prior to the inaugural weekend of the new @entity23 season , we had been promised by the @entity24 that their old dog would show us a few new tricks			2
and that the pundits would be encouraged to let fly with their opinions			2
having lost his man for @entity52 ’s winner at @entity53 , as well as ending up kneeing a chance to cancel it out , @entity1 ’s fellow pundit in @entity49 , @entity35 , took almost too much pleasure in pointing out where he ’d gone wrong			1
he reminded us that @entity49 had said out there that he was not a fan of zonal marking , then gleefully added he clearly was n’t ‘ a fan of marking either ’			0
while of his miss , the old @entity62 9 shook his head forlornly and said ‘ all the practise we put in on @entity66 ’			0
all this though , as you ’d expect , with a twinkle in the eye			0
but those samba days of summer clearly worked as a benchmark for the new approach to this @entity8 season			1
to underline that point , it was @entity77 who was tasked with filling the chair vacated by @entity30			1
there will be many who feel that simply removing @entity30 ’s overbearing personality would be enough to give @entity8 its ‘ new look ’			1
but you ca n’t just have an empty chair			0
tv pals : @entity35 ( far left ) and @entity1 ( second left ) were part of the @entity24 's @entity46 punditry team conflicting ideas : @entity77 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) did n't always see eye - to - eye on decisions @entity77 clearly did n’t find it a big seat to fill			1
he became part of the team in @entity95 , and it showed on saturday night			2
first of all , he dovetailed nicely with his @entity98 counterpart			0
and finally , finally , was doing so at least in part because now both pundits shared their opinions on all the games			0
that abstract system of letting one man talk as the other sat mute is now hopefully a thing of the past			0
but it was n’t all a box of chocolates between them			0
when discussing the @entity115 penalty and subsequent red card at @entity117 , it got a bit tasty			1
@entity77 stood his ground by stating ‘ it ’s the rules ’ , but @entity35 chipped away stating the ref ‘ should show common sense ’			1
they smiled benignly at each other on set , but i bet they carried on that little tete a tete after the lights had dimmed			0
it was certainly what the dj ’s amongst us might call the right vibe			0
seeing red : @entity77 and @entity35 disagreed over the dismissal of @entity138 's @entity115 ( second right ) correct decision ? @entity115 ( centre ) was sent off for deliberate handball at @entity142 on saturday and what of the guv’nor ? i ’ve often pointed out that @entity146 is one of the best sports anchors we ’ve got			1
and the fact he was a top notch pro in his previous career is most certainly the icing on the cake			0
on saturday night , though , he reminded us he is none too shabby in the role of journalist , either			2
although , granted , @entity160 ’s co-chairman @entity159 is a bit of a gaping net as he seems an affable , open man			0
nevertheless - in the innovation introduced last season of @entity146 capturing an interview post match with a figure in the headlines - the host pushed the envelope just a little further than i seem to remember him doing before			1
one of the best : @entity146 is regarded as one of @entity174 's best sporting presenters nice touch : @entity146 demonstrated his journalistic skills in his interview with @entity159 ( centre ) questions about @entity180 such as ‘ perhaps he thought there was a better job out there ? ’ , ‘ do you feel let down ? ’ and then saying ‘ worth an ask ’ before enquiring who would be his replacement , may seem obvious			1
but in the more comfortable , perhaps sterile atmosphere of @entity8 in , say , its thirties and forties , i do n’t think they would have been asked			1
and luckily for us all , so honestly and interestingly answered			0
which in part may just be because people do n’t want to let @entity146 down ? they want to tell him the truth			1
a good trick in our game if you can pull that off ! and so we ’re off and running again and @entity8 is looking more than match fit at the grand old age of fifty			1
and perhaps this is just the right season for it to suck in its gut , trim the nose hairs and not buy its shirts from the supermarket			0
@entity211 reckoned on saturday night that ‘ it ’s thirteen teams that could go down ’			2
while @entity77 described the @entity23 as now being ‘ not weaker ( but ) interesting			2
' well here ’s to @entity8 echoing those words throughout its half century .			2
