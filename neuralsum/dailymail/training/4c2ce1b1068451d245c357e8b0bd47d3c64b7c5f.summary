by @entity0 if you have ever been to a football match , it will come as no surprise to find that fans like to swear			2
researchers looking at fans ' tweets during football matches found that around one in 20 tweets about the beautiful game contains some form of profanity			1
but perhaps more surprising was that discovery that swearing is usually directed at their own team , rather than match officials or opponents - with @entity21 fans among the worst offenders			1
analysis of football fans ' tweets during games has found that they mostly swear about their own teams researchers found that @entity21 fans were most likely to swear when talking about their team the team of researchers found that roughly one in 20 tweets about football contains a profanity the study , carried out by @entity38 's dr @entity37 and dr @entity39 , looked at tweets about @entity41 matches on saturday afternoons over three consecutive weeks			1
they collected an average of just over 125,000 tweets during the allotted analysis period on each match day			2
analysis revealed that almost 6,500 tweets , or just over 5 per cent , contained the two most common swearwords in the @entity51 language			0
while fans used swear words to express frustration with their team or opponents ' foul play , at other times they were used in expressions of celebration or humour			1
the research paper concludes : ' through a careful analysis of a collection of tweets about football that contain swearing , we have shown that bad language is not always negative ; that the wider context is often crucial to interpret meaning ; and that perhaps counter-intuitively , some of the strongest sentiments expressed are self - critical			0
' it goes on : ' we have seen that fans of @entity41 teams often swear about or at their own team , and relatively rarely about an opposing team or match officials			2
researchers found that @entity21 fans were the most likely to swear about their own team ( file pic ) the team from @entity82 concluded that swearing online is not always negative , and among football fans is often used as a show of passion ' it may be that swearing is being used as a means of demonstrating affiliation to a particular group , or to demonstrate greater passion about their own team and an apparent indifference to all others			1
' reflecting on the research , dr @entity96 said : ' it 's no secret that football fans like to swear			0
but what 's surprising is how and why they swear			0
' for example , we found that fans are even more likely to swear when something great happens - when their team scores a goal , for example - than they are when something bad occurs			1
' one aspect which might surprise the casual fan is the extent to which diehards swear about their own team , researchers said			2
' we found that @entity21 fans in particular were fantastic for this			1
' added dr @entity96 , a supporter of the team herself			0
' even when they 've just scored , @entity21 fans always find something to gripe about			2
' fans were also found swearing at their own team more often than match officials , despite controversial decisions ( pictured , referee @entity122 sends off @entity124 's @entity123 after mistaking him for @entity125 ) dr @entity39 , senior research fellow at @entity38 's innovation , design and sustainability research institute , said : ' there 's a serious side to this research			1
' sentiment mining - the attempt to understand what emotions people are expressing in their online social networks - is huge business			0
' until now , many sentiment miners had taken the rather naive view that swearing is always a sign of anger or frustration			0
' our research shows that this is not the case - that swearing can also be an intensifier that is used at times of elation or excitement			0
' the research paper , entitled @entity152 : sentiment , swearing and soccer , is to be presented next week at a multimedia conference .			0

researchers looked at 125,000 fans ' tweets over three saturdays
they found that roughly one in 20 tweets contained a profanity

@entity21 supporters were singled out as the worst offenders
*authors* think the swear words could be used in order to show passion
