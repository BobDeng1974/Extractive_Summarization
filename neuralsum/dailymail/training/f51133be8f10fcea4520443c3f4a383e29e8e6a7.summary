in the second of three extracts , we look at how to make the necessary changes to the home			2
providing a helping hand : six million @entity2 are carers to an adult , often a family member who suffers from a long - term health problem what needs to be done when you think about how to adapt a home to suit a person ’s particular needs , it is important to consider costs , aesthetics , the impact of the changes on the home , and how they may affect other household members			1
@entity32 decisions can be costly , so it can pay to seek professional advice			2
the changes made will depend on the circumstances of the person you are caring for			0
someone who is convalescing for a short period after illness wo n’t need expensive changes – look for low - cost , practical solutions			2
if specialist equipment is needed for a short period , you might be able to borrow it			0
for example , the @entity2 @entity48 lends medical equipment such as wheelchairs ( @entity52 , 0844 871 1111 )			1
@entity53 before making any adaptations , it is a good idea to seek advice from an occupational therapist – health professionals who specialise in enabling people with limited mobility , illness or other special needs to maintain their independence in the home			1
they also give advice on equipment and can make arrangements for home adaptations to be carried out			1
they can be accessed through your doctor or social services			0
before you meet the therapist , it ’s worth listing all the areas where you feel that help is needed			0

@entity110 ( @entity111 , 08450 264748 ) and @entity112 ( dlf.org.uk , 08451 309177 ) may be able to provide further information			0
if you are eligible , some assessments can be fast - tracked , especially if an individual ’s needs are not complex			0
