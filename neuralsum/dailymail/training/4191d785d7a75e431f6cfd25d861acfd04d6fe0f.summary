gravity measurements reveal deformations in @entity4 's interior that suggest a layer of liquid ‘ sloshing around ’			1
the ocean is thought to be made of water with a depth of a couple of hundred kilometres			2
it appears to cover the entire moon beneath 100 kilometres of ice			0
the evidence comes from the @entity22 space agency @entity21 's probe @entity23 , which made six fly - bys of @entity4 between 2006 and 2011			1
scientists used signals beamed back by @entity23 to measure distortions in @entity4 's gravitational field			1
the data showed something strange happening in the moon 's interior which indicated the presence of liquid water			2
writing in the journal @entity41 , the planetary experts led by dr @entity37 , from @entity38 in @entity39 , concluded : ‘ such a large response to the tidal field requires that @entity4 's interior is deformable over time scales of the orbital period , in a way that is consistent with a global ocean at depth			2
’ @entity4 is now believed to belong to an elite ‘ club ’ of moons with sub-surface oceans			0
other members include @entity55 's moons @entity53 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
scientists have speculated about the possibility of life evolving in the hidden oceans			0
but there are doubts about whether anything could survive on icy @entity4			0
in a news story accompanying the research paper , science writer @entity65 says : ‘ inside @entity53 , planetary scientists believe hot springs on a rocky ocean floor may be belching all the nutrients and inorganic building blocks required by life			0
‘ but other kinds of gravity studies show that @entity4 has a cold , icy ocean floor , so no hot water can be leaching life - giving chemicals into the ocean			1

measurements show water below surface
scans by @entity21 's @entity23 probe
thin icy *crust* then ' ocean ' beneath
