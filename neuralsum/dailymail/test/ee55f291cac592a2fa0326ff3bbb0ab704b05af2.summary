a university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in @entity2 left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution			1
as renting in the capital soared to an average of more than £ 1,100 per month , the second year history and politics student who attends a @entity2 university told how she took up sex work – even visiting some clients at their workplace			1
speaking through the @entity14 ' , the woman – who asked to remain anonymous – spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry			1
a university student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent ( picture posed by model ) the survey conducted by the @entity25 further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry			1
the young woman said that she did n't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her			2
she said : ' i started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs : in a coffee shop , a pub and as a waitress			0
' the student loan did n't cover even my housing , let alone living expenses , food , books and travel costs			1
' she added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially			0
' i had trouble keeping up with course work , especially if i worked evenings			2
' for example at the pub , i 'd earn £ 7 an hour for an eight hour shift , two nights a week , so i 'd bring home about £ 100 weekly			0
' i 'd just moved to @entity2 from the north of @entity57			1
my family are not well off , so can not afford to help me much			0
the student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in @entity2 ' i did n't know anyone in @entity2 so when i moved here it was starting from scratch			1
' initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better			2
' it was an overcrowded , noisy flat with other students , ' she said of her halls			2
she moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services			0
' i could afford a place of my own			0
i advertise through a website and have regular clients			2
' i visit them at home , in hotels and occasionally at their workplace			0
' despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies			1
' it is flexible and fits around my course			0
' i can work the hours i want to and scale back around exam time or if i have extra course work			2
' the woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money			1
' in my first year at university i started hearing about students turning to sex work , ' she said			1
' after a time i met someone on another course who 'd been working as a stripper in a bar			0
' through her i met another student doing escorting , she clued me in , said where to advertise , and how to avoid bad clients and work safely			2
' she gave me the @entity108 which tells about the laws and how they work			2
although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in @entity2 the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work			1
' my biggest worry is about being arrested because if i get a criminal record it would stay with me for life			0
it would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs			0
' however she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes			0
' sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work i know of			1
' friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage			0
others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get			0
' sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills			1
' i know students who 've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures			2
' however she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out			0
' mostly students doing sex work do n't talk about it			1
if it comes out , it could affect your future and job prospects			0
' the student 's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities : ' since i started escorting i 've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent			1
' another woman i know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family			0
' sex work among students is much more common than people think , and it is likely to increase as long as fees , rent and the cost of living is so high			1
