@entity2 metal band , @entity0 , has just made history			1
they are the first - ever band to play a live gig atop a gigantic iceberg - located in the middle of the @entity8			1
the defiled performed on top of a floating platform for the @entity11 – which sees artists put to the test as they perform in unconventional , ice - cold conditions			1
the small crowd , mostly from the nearby town of @entity26 , ventured to the ice field to watch this once - in - a - lifetime gig from fishing boats			0
to reach their iceberg stage , the band first flew to @entity32 , before transferring to @entity26 , @entity8 , and then heading by boat to the small island of @entity35 , which has a population of just over 2000			2
it actually took several days of searching to find the ' perfect ' berg - one that was large and thick enough to hold the band and all of their equipment			0
it took days of searching to find the perfect iceberg - it needed to be large and thick enough to hold the band locals , who have lived and worked on the icebergs for years , helped the band to shuttle their instruments and sound equipment to the gig stage , and to thank them for their help , the group donated their equipment to the local community hall after the gig			1
band member @entity55 said : ' this has to be one of the most insane gigs we 've ever played ! you see these things on tv documentaries but it 's not until you get to see them in real life that you realise just how big and amazing icebergs are			0
' although it was cold , i do n't think any of us noticed once we got started			0
the stage location literally takes your breath away			0
' to capture the footage , state - of - the - art flying drone cameras were used and controlled by nearby boats known for their dark and imposing on - stage outfits - which provided an incredible contrast to the all - white surroundings - @entity0 played a 30 minute set in total , featuring tracks from their latest album daggers			1
to capture the footage , @entity11 and the band utilised state - of - the - art ' octocopter flying drone cameras , ' controlled remotely by the boats nearby , which hovered above the iceberg			2
@entity89 , @entity11 music manager , added : ' as far as stage backdrops go , i do n’t think you ’ll find anything more impressive than this			0
