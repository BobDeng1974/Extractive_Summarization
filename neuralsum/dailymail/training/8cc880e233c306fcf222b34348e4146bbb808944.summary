@entity1 , the mp for @entity13 in @entity14 , also called for the food prices in the lavish dining rooms of the @entity9 to be reduced to make them more affordable for mps			1
the former barrister was trying to illustrate how few mps were dining in exclusive restaurants next to him last week			2
describing one particular lunch , he said : ‘ the service was absolutely fantastic because there was three - to - one service : ' three servants for each person sitting down			2
' @entity20 immediately pounced on his use of the word , shouting out the word ‘ servants ! ’ in disbelief			2
but mr @entity1 replied ‘ exactly ’ and carried on making the case for lower prices			1
@entity37 , @entity4 ’s shadow leader of the @entity9 , immediately took to @entity38 to admonish mr @entity1 : ‘ @entity2 mp @entity1 lets the cat out of the bag by referring to @entity42 waiters and waitresses as ' servants ! ' ’ labour whip @entity45 also expressed disbelief , saying : ‘ good grief - a @entity2 mp in the @entity9 has just described the catering staff who work in the @entity9 dining rooms as ' servants '			1
’ @entity52 , a @entity4 mp , said : ‘ it ’s an outrageous slur on the hard - working staff in the @entity9			1
it reveals how out of touch both he and the @entity2 party are if they think they can call people who work for them servants			2
’ mr @entity1 said the cost of dining should be cut for mps to encourage them to eat on the parliamentary estate within the confines of @entity69 @entity1 is well known for one thing - his deep loathing of the @entity72			1
the son of a judge , he was born in @entity75 in 1947 , attending @entity76 before studying for a law degree at @entity78			0
he was called to the bar in 1972 and elected as an mp 11 years later in @entity80			2
a junior minister for environment and transport in the @entity84 and @entity85 governments , he lost his seat in the 1992 election			0
returning to @entity7 as mp for @entity13 , @entity88 gave him a frontbench job but he left the shadow cabinet in 2005			1
an arch - thatcherite and climate sceptic , he called for the minimum wage to be abolished in 2009			0
he sparked controversy last year when he made a last minute objection to a debate on the @entity99 disaster , claiming a debate on @entity20 ' was more important			0
a rebel , he once ridiculed @entity102 claiming plans for plain cigarette packaging will make it easier for the @entity105 to work out policies ' on the back of a fag packet '			0
however mr @entity1 – who once backed legislation to abolish the national minimum wage – was unrepentant			1
he told @entity112 he had not meant anything ‘ derogatory ’ with the use of the term ‘ servants ’			0
‘ everyone who works in the @entity9 is a servant of the @entity9			0
it certainly has been that way for the last 25 years , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
asked if this applied to mps , he said : ‘ no , we are servants of the government – that ’s a joke			0
’ mr @entity1 said : ‘ i was actually complimenting the people concerned			1
’ he added : ‘ i was asking whether pricing mechanisms can be used to ensure we increase the use of the @entity9 dining rooms			0
when i was dining last week , one one occasion there were three people serving for every one person dining			2
‘ it is good for the @entity134 but not very good for the [ @entity9 ] finances			0
’ mr @entity1 confirmed that he did not have servants at home , saying : ‘ my wife and i do not have any staff			1
’ however , if the authorities caved to his demands for lower prices , it would lead to a higher taxpayer subsidy			0
@entity145 pledged to raise the prices in the @entity69 to stop taxpayers having to subsidise the food bills of £ 66,000 - a - year @entity20 .			0

@entity13 mp @entity1 *criticised* for labelling catering staff
