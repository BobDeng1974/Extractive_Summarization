' we would " field test " things in the back , ' one of several anonymous former @entity6 employees revealed to @entity17 of their destructive behaviour this week			1
' most people would throw phones on the ground , slide them across the floor , and once we tried to see who could get the biggest crack			0
' the @entity30 , @entity10 and other devices , all within the hundreds of dollars in shelf price , were all replaceable and without cost to the employees , according to their claims			2
destroyed : an alleged former @entity6 store employee sent in this photograph of a smashed @entity10 , allegedly taken after the device was intentionally smashed for fun this email exchange between @entity17 and an anonymous employee details their sport of ' football ' with a cracked @entity30 until exchanging it for a brand new one that 's precisely what lead to their mischief they said			1
' i had an extra phone lying around with a single crack , so we played football around the back of the store for a while , and when we were done , we just created what 's known as a @entity59 code for it and swapped it with a brand spanking new phone , ' another wrote to the website			0
' my management is so corrupt it goes beyond the retail stores , ' another wrote in			2
calls from @entity68 to an @entity6 representatives were not immediately returned			1
in august two former employees of a @entity78 store - whose astonishing recounts over the summer launched this latest national report - wrote of their corporate regional manager ’s trade of computers for plastic surgery			1
according to the unidentified source , they would allegedly provide heavily discounted @entity6 computers to a local plastic surgeon so that the female employee could receive a complimentary stomach stapling procedure in return			1
players : an unidentified female employee wrote in with her own scandalous confessions in the back of an @entity91 while seen here sitting inside a storage box ' she made quid pro quo an art , ' that employee identified as @entity94 said			0
behind the scenes in @entity6 's @entity100 - dubbed ' the best place to get support for @entity6 products ' according to @entity6 - it was an entirely other scene according to a slew of similar reports			1
in a popular note by the store ’s alleged tech employees referred to as ‘ geniuses ’ by the company – much like @entity111 ’s tech department is run by the so - called @entity114 - customers ' personal information was , like their products photographed smashed on the floor , not always so safe			2
' ... the first thing we 'd do is ask for a passcode and say we were going to open it in the back ... ' one wrote to @entity17			0

’ no one 's safe : another employee emailed in an alleged common practice of employees stealing and passing around photos taken from customers ' computers , including young girls not so clear : an apple store is seen with its characteristic glass walls while inside former employees have documented a less than clear behind - the - scene behaviour but as @entity17 continues , alleged drug use in the stores made @entity155 not the only white items found in some stores			1

they hinted the employee having a father in the business as a support			0
following august ’s first report in @entity17 described as tackling ‘ the most corrupt @entity91 in @entity7 , ’ readers chimed in to provide contrasting claims of atrocious and unethical behaviour , arguing that not all @entity6 stores are like this			1

you [ have ] no idea the miracles we have to do on some computers and @entity155 for 16 dollars a hour			0
