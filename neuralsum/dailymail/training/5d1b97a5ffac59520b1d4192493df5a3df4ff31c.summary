by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 28 july 2013 international tug - of - love : @entity2 faces a custody battle with her @entity5 ex-husband a mother who abducted four of her five children in a tug - of - love dispute has spoken for the first time of the dramatic moment 15 police officers armed with @entity11 stormed their secret hideaway			1
@entity2 , 47 , went on the run with her two boys and two girls to prevent them being returned to their father in @entity5			1
but after a nationwide search , police tracked her through her mobile phone to a guesthouse in @entity21 , @entity22			2
‘ four or five squad cars arrive outside and about 15 officers swarmed into the building with @entity11 in their hands , ’ said @entity23 in an interview with @entity25			0
‘ they put me in handcuffs ... and the four children were taken away to a police station			1
’ since that day last october she has not been allowed to see her two youngest children , @entity35 , ten , and @entity36 , eight			1
‘ i feel so terrible for them in particular because in my heart i feel i let them down because ultimately i could n’t stop their father taking them back to @entity5 , ’ said @entity23 , an @entity37 teacher			1
and she revealed that four days before she went into hiding , she was told by a policeman that it was clear to him her children did n’t want to go back to @entity5			1
miss @entity2 claims he told her : ‘ i know what i would do if i was in your position – i would go down for my kids if it came to it ... you are their mother and you have got to do what you think is the right thing			1
’ last week she had the threat of jail lifted from her at the @entity59 in @entity60 where she was cleared of contempt of court charges for failing to hand over her children			2
sir @entity62 , president of the @entity59 , ruled she had not wilfully breached the order			0
final custody is still to be agreed			0
happier times : ex-husband @entity67 with children , from left , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity35 , @entity71 and @entity36 as it stands , two of the children , @entity71 , 15 , and 13 - year - old @entity74 , remain with their mother in @entity77 while @entity23 ’s eldest daughter , @entity70 , 17 , lives in @entity5 with her father , lieutenant colonel @entity80 , and her younger brother and sister			1
describing how events unfolded after her arrest when her ex-husband collected the children from the police station , @entity23 said : ‘ the only reason @entity71 and @entity74 were not handed over was because the social workers and a police officer who were present stepped in			1
‘ @entity71 and @entity74 were old enough and big enough to physically resist			0
i ’m so impressed at how they stood up to their father that day			2
‘ the policeman then stepped in and told him to leave them alone			0
so he left with the two youngest , who by now were in the car with @entity70			2
‘ if they ’d been big enough to resist physically maybe they ’d still be with me too			0
but by law none of the children should be with me			2
‘ the @entity5 court order says they should all be in @entity5 with their father because in 2009 a @entity5 court ruled they should be there because , in the judge ’s words at the time , they are deemed to be habitually resident in @entity5			1
desperate : a letter from @entity71 , @entity2 's daughter , begging a judge to let her stay ‘ i will fight to my dying breath to keep them here with me and to get my youngest two children back , too			1
‘ @entity70 will always be welcome as well , but she is almost an adult now and she has made her choices			0
’ following the collapse of their 12 - year marriage in 2008 , her ex-husband won custody in his native country of all five children in a legal process @entity23 describes as ‘ highly questionable ’			1
last october , as the deadline for handing over her children loomed , @entity23 received calls from the police every half an hour			2
‘ i kept telling them i did n’t want them to be taken before i ’d got home to say goodbye to them			0
‘ to be fair , the police were extremely understanding and were not putting me under any added pressure			0
after my conversation with the policeman a few days earlier , we all went home and i sat the kids down on the settee and i said to them , “ ok children , it stops here , i promise			2
you are not going back to @entity5			1
” ‘ their faces immediately broke out into huge smiles and they started cheering			0
’ she claims the children have all testified , in written and verbal statements to lawyers and court officials over the years , to wanting to remain with her , but to this day the orders granting mr @entity80 custody of all five stand			1
mr @entity80 categorically denies his ex-wife ’s claims of ever mistreating her or any of his children physically or psychologically			2
‘ it ’s incredibly complex legally , ’ said ms @entity2			1
heartbroken : miss @entity2 says that she will fight to her ' dying day ' to keep her children ‘ i believe i have suffered a grievous miscarriage of justice but it is costing me everything i have , financially and emotionally , to have it overturned			1
‘ because the order was granted on @entity5 soil , it is almost impossible to have it overruled in the @entity165			1
‘ i have to fight it in @entity5 , but the moment i set foot there i am worried the children ’s father will pull another legal order out of the hat			1
‘ i dare not return to @entity5 for this reason at present but moves are under way to appeal the original custody orders			1
i ’ve spent £ 40,000 , my mother has remortgaged her house and @entity181 [ her partner ] has handed over every penny that he ’s earned			0
’ her blue - green eyes well with tears as she speaks			0
dark circles beneath them speak of the sleepless nights and strain she has endured			0
‘ sometimes i just lie in bed in the small hours sobbing my heart out because it ’s all got too much for me			0
i miss my youngest two children so much , ’ she says			1
for now , she has to make do with occasional phone calls to or from the children			2
she says she has a ‘ standing arrangement ’ that she can call their father ’s mobile at 8pm any day to speak with them , but , she says , the phone is rarely switched on at that time			2
‘ i am certain @entity36 and @entity35 are too terrified to phone me , ’ she says ‘ the last time i spoke to any of them was on may 23 when her father had miraculously left the phone on so i could wish her happy birthday			0
‘ i try calling every night and so do @entity71 and @entity69			0
it is so hard for them , too			0
‘ i know @entity35 in particular will be finding it so hard to cope because she only used to be able to fall asleep if she was holding @entity71 ’s hand			0
it hurts so much to think about it			0
‘ all i know is that i will never give up on them			0

@entity2 , 47 , from @entity216 went on the run with her children
@entity5 ex-husband had won the right to keep them in @entity5 in 2009
since then she has not been allowed to see her two youngest children
she says that she will fight to her ' dying day ' for them
