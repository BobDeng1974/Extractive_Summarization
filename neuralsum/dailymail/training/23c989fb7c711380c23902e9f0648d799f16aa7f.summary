a woman was left feeling ‘ hideous ’ after an allergic reaction to hair dye triggered severe rosacea and her skin erupted in furious spots			1
@entity6 , 33 , had her hair dyed blonde at a salon after getting engaged to her fiancé , @entity10			1
but hours later , she was rushed to @entity11 because her face and lips had swollen to twice their size			1
doctors gave her steroid creams and antibiotics and said the redness would be temporary , but weeks later her skin was still stinging and covered in spots			1
she was diagnosed with rosacea , a skin condition which usually affects older women , as a result of an allergic reaction to the hair dye			1
just months before her wedding and after becoming distressed over her skin , she was recommended a cream containing capers which cleared her skin within weeks mrs @entity6 experienced soreness and redness at the slightest trigger for months			1
having a glass of red wine , or going out in the cold could trigger a flare up , as could wearing make up or using products			2
finally she found a cream which worked after tweeting a beauty blog			2
here she is pictured , left and right , with clear skin after using the caper - containing cream mrs @entity6 's skin cleared for her wedding day			1
being able to look ' radiant ' as she walked down the aisle was the ' best wedding present she could have asked for ' , she says for months , her skin would burn hot and red after a glass of wine or going out into the cold and she thought about cancelling her upcoming wedding			1
desperate for clear skin on her big day , she tweeted beauty blogs for advice			1
she eventually stumbled across a skin cream that contains an extract of capers , the salty green buds found in tartare sauce			1
the caper extract in the cream is said to have anti-inflammatory properties , and within three weeks the spots had subsided and her skin was less sensitive and red			1
miraculously , by her wedding day just weeks later , her skin was ‘ radiantly clear ’ - something she described as the ' best wedding present ever ’			1
mrs @entity6 , from @entity72 , said she was eventually told is was her hair dye that triggered the rosacea in the first place			1
she told @entity76 : ‘ i had just got engaged and fancied a change so decided to get my hair highlighted			0
‘ i was delighted with my new blonde hair until i got home and my face started swelling up			1
' within a few hours i could barely see			0
my eyes were like two swollen eggs , my lips had swollen to almost double the size and i had red blotches all over my face and my skin was red hot			2
’ rosacea is a common but poorly understood long - term skin condition that mainly affects the face			2
symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing ( where the skin turns red for a short period ) , but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses , such as : rosacea is a relapsing condition , which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad , followed by periods when the condition is less severe			1
many of the symptoms of rosacea can be controlled to a degree with treatment			0
but the changes to physical appearance that may occur as a result of the condition can still have a significant psychological and social impact			0
it affects how a person feels about themselves and how they interact with others			0
‘ in panic , we rushed into @entity11 as i was worried the swelling was n’t going to stop and that maybe my skin would split as my face was stinging like crazy			1
' mrs @entity6 was told she had suffered a severe reaction to the hair dye			1
doctors gave her steroid injections to try and calm the swelling and she was eventually sent home with a course of antibiotics and tablets to take for two weeks			1
although the doctors said the reaction was bad , they added it would be temporary			2
but after a week , while the swelling had subsided , her face was still red , blotchy and very sore			1
she said : ‘ my skin kept flaring up red and i had developed small furious spots all over my cheeks , nose and chin			2
' before the hair dye reaction i ’d always had lovely skin , i was devastated ' for months the symptoms persisted and she could no longer put products she ’d used for years on her face for fear it would cause a flare - up			1
she said : ‘ anything would trigger it from a hot room to wind or a glass of wine			0
my skin seemed totally out of control			0
‘ i started reacting to almost every skin cream or cosmetic i put on my face , ones i had been using for years with no problems			2
‘ now they would make my skin sting and go furiously red and blotchy			2
‘ i knew there was something seriously wrong with my skin but i did n’t realise it was such a serious condition			0
’ eventually , mrs @entity6 went to her doctor who immediately diagnosed her with rosacea as well as hyper sensitivity of the skin			1
he said the hair dye reaction had triggered full blown rosacea even though she was relatively young to have it			1
usually rosacea effects women in their 40s and 50s			0
miss @entity6 ( right ) was trying out a new blonde hair colour in celebration of her engagement to fiancé @entity10 ( left )			1
they were at a black tie dinner at the @entity182 in @entity183 when her face began to swell up mrs @entity6 had experimented with her hair colour when she was younger			1
she is pictured here , left , with blonde hair			0
she had decided to dye her hair blonde again in preparation for her wedding she was prescribed a steroid cream to put on her skin , which worked well for six months , before the rosacea came back with a vengeance			1
her doctors warned long - term use of the steroid cream could damage her skin permanently			1
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ by this time i was becoming panicked as i was due to get married in a few months and my skin was getting worse and worse , ’ she recalls			2
‘ i imagined myself in my wedding photos with this bright red spotty skin and it made me feel like cancelling the whole thing			2
‘ i was desperate to find something other than steroids that could help with my skin			0
’ she tried an array of cosmetics , from nappy cream to @entity208 , but northing worked			0
‘ most products burned my skin and made the redness worse and i had had to resort back to the steroid cream to control my skin , as a result			1
‘ some products dried out dry my skin so badly it started to flake off			0
it was a vicious circle			0
nothing really works on the redness , which was almost always there , even with the steroid cream			1
’ her fiancé @entity10 was very supportive , but was upset as he could see how distressed she became as their wedding day crept closer and closer			0
it was a traumatic incident in a brideswear shop that triggered her to find products that would n’t inflame her skin			0
she said : ‘ one day when i went shopping for my wedding dress with my mum and bridesmaids my face went so red i had to abandon my dress fitting and sit down in a café with ice cubes on my face			2
’ ‘ i got home and decided i just had to stop using everything on my skin even if it meant looking dreadful			0
mrs @entity6 says she hopes her story will give hope to rosacea sufferers who are searching for treatments for the condition			2
here , she is pictured with clear skin after using the @entity245 's @entity244 range ‘ i felt my skin had just had enough and it was reacting to everything i put on it			0
when i stopped the steroid cream completely my skin erupted			1
’ in desperation , she tweeted beauty blogs to see if anyone had a remedy for rosacea without chemicals in it			1
she stumbled across the @entity245 ’s @entity244 products after someone tweeted her back and recommended it			0
‘ it ’s been the best bit of advice i ’ve ever had , ’ she said			0
@entity244 skincare contains a patented caper extract called @entity263			0
its manufacturers claim it can reduce skin redness and sensitivity by up to 70 per cent in four weeks , after carrying out a clinical trial of 20 people			2
this is because the caper - extract present in the product has anti-inflammatory properties , they claim , as proved by a @entity275 study published in 1985			0
‘ within three weeks the spots had started to subside and my skin was much less sensitive and red , ' mrs @entity6 said			1
a study carried out in 1985 found capers - used in @entity244 products - have anti-inflammatory properties @entity244 claims its cream can help rosacea sufferers because it contains a blend of caper extracts called @entity263			2
a study published in 1985 showed that caper buds offer anti-inflammatory activity and are almost as effective as a recognised anti-inflammatory compound called oxyphenbutazone , the study reported			0
@entity292 induced a 50 per cent reduction in inflammation , as opposed to 66 per cent for oxyphenbutazone			0
@entity244 tested its new formula on a panel of 20 people with sensitive , reactive skin , prone to discomfort and redness			0
after four weeks , the volunteers reported improvements to their skin of between 10 to 70 per cent , compared with another calming ingredient called @entity306			0
@entity244 claims its range significantly reduces redness , decreases skin reactivity and improves skin comfort			0
source : @entity311 ‘ my friends started commenting on how amazingly clear my skin looked			0
’ with her wedding just a few weeks away , she was delighted with the results			0
‘ not only had the redness drastically reduced , my skin was virtually clear of spots and had stopped stinging			2
’ mrs @entity6 was able to celebrate her wedding day without the embarrassment of red skin			1
she said : ‘ for my wedding day , my skin was radiantly clear , it was the best wedding present i could have asked for			2
' now , she is able to wear make - up , but she gives her skin ‘ breaks ’ at weekends or when she goes on holiday			0
she hopes her story will give hope to rosacea sufferers who are searching for treatments for the condition			0
she said : ‘ i ’d recommend @entity244 to anyone with rosacea who feels a sense of despair that there is nothing that will help calm down their skin because i have discovered that there is			0

@entity6 , 33 , dyed her hair blonde to celebrate her engagement
