for more facts and stats from the @entity2 go to our @entity3 there was torrential rain in @entity7 , a goal by @entity9 and the collapse of @entity12 ’s painfully fragile defensive unit			1
stop me if you ’ve heard it before			2
five days after his team surrendered a 3 - 0 lead in @entity19 against @entity20 , @entity21 saw another lead washed away			1
only these lost points will perhaps prove even more damaging as defeat leaves @entity12 trailing a dozen points behind @entity27 pacesetters @entity28			1

what a weekend it has been for @entity92 and how @entity21 must wonder if it would have been better to bid farewell in the afterglow of an @entity97 win at @entity98			0
his side struggle with familiar problems : the inability to defend a lead and the character to resist setbacks			2
two clean sheets have been followed by two lost leads			0
for every step or two forward there is one back			0
the squad lacks depth in defence and the back four is being held together with sticking plaster			0
regardless , @entity21 maintains his footballing principles			0
as the @entity27 breaks for international football , 11 games into the campaign , @entity12 feel too far off the pace			1
they are a point behind @entity7 , who responded brilliantly after going behind in the 63rd minute			2
@entity29 ’s side were behind for 12 minutes before @entity40 levelled with a superb free - kick and @entity34 scored in the winner , his first in the @entity27 , seconds after coming on to replace @entity57			1
@entity7 survived a chaotic finish and a desperate penalty appeal when a header from @entity128 skidded into @entity52 ’s arm and , without injured wingers @entity131 and @entity132 and with @entity133 suspended , they deserved their win			1
how they celebrated at the end , no - one more so than former @entity12 duo : goalkeeper @entity48 and centre back @entity50 , starting his first @entity27 game of the season			1
for an hour it had been a tense struggle , littered by fouls , cautions and treatment for injuries , contrary to expectations from two fluent passing teams			0
@entity7 had started well , @entity12 fought back and , ultimately , @entity21 ’s team paid the price again for their inability to close ranks and protect a lead			1
@entity153 winger @entity32 tormented @entity154 , who has the look of a talented teenager in need of a break			2
@entity32 was too quick and direct for @entity68 and created the winner with a burst of acceleration down the left wing and a perfect cross for @entity34 to head in			2
@entity7 midfielder @entity32 ( right ) and @entity78 battle for the ball in the first half @entity57 ( left ) goes up for an aerial challenge with @entity12 's makeshift centre half @entity71 @entity32 involved in a tussle again , this time with @entity12 full back @entity154 @entity7 keeper @entity48 comes and punches the ball as @entity68 ( centre ) looks to get his head on it @entity77 ( left ) skips past @entity7 midfielder @entity175 @entity154 ( right ) appears to push @entity57 in the back but referee @entity90 ( left ) said no penalty @entity57 looks to line up a shot with @entity179 ( left ) and @entity75 in close attendance @entity12 goalkeeper @entity67 spreads himself as @entity51 ( right ) tries to poke the ball towards goal @entity90 stayed consistent with select group refereeing style of not giving minor infringements by waving away @entity7 penalty appeals midway through the first half when @entity154 pushed @entity57 in the back right in front of him			1
it was a clear penalty to any neutral watching as @entity68 had no possibility of playing the ball but just wanted to put @entity57 off			2
law does not state that a push needs to be a big one ! this policy of low level involvement does nothing to back up @entity199 claims that referees are 95 per cent accurate			0
@entity201 @entity29 was rewarded for refusing to flinch			0
@entity34 was stripped and ready to come on when @entity40 curled his free - kick over the defensive wall and into the top corner from 25 yards , beyond the dive of @entity67			1
@entity21 disputed the free - kick but it was awarded after a cynical trip by @entity72 to halt a swift counter-attack by @entity64 , a @entity210 striker			1
@entity29 went for the kill rather than attempt to protect the point			0
@entity213 went @entity34 as planned and he had scored within seconds , after winning the ball and linking in with his midfield			2
play was swept out to the @entity7 left , where @entity32 tore past @entity68 and clipped an inviting cross towards @entity34 , who climbed above @entity75 and @entity71 to thump his header inside the post			1
@entity12 had been 15 minutes from victory but were rarely comfortable and it is hard to escape the feeling that @entity7 ’s refusal to give up was motivated at least in part by the fact @entity21 ’s team are so brittle			1
they can be got at			0
it is not a new theory but there is , it seems , a psychological weakness within a superbly gifted team , and it is costing them in the toughest competitions			0
@entity67 dives as @entity63 ( centre ) heads the ball towards goal after a @entity7 corner @entity79 bursts past @entity7 defender @entity52 and gets a shot away on @entity48 's goal the view from behind as @entity9 ( no 17 ) steers the ball past @entity48 and into the goal @entity9 jumps for joy after putting @entity12 a goal up with a tidy finish from 12 yards @entity40 ( partially obscured , left ) curls his free - kick up and over the wall and into the corner of the net @entity40 is congratulated by @entity50 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) after his equalising goal @entity254 's graphic showing @entity40 's superb free - kick @entity34 rises to the occasion by leaping above the @entity12 defenders and powering a header into the net @entity260 miles @entity7 110.7 68.8 @entity40 90 12.3 7.6 @entity63 90 12.0 7.4 @entity49 90 11.0 6.8 @entity12 110.7 68.8 @entity154 89 11.1 6.9 @entity78 90 11.1 6.9 @entity79 90 10.7 6.6 @entity29 felt his team should have had an early penalty when @entity68 barged into @entity57 as the @entity263 controlled a ball on his chest			1
@entity57 fell in a heap and there was exaggerated disbelief inside the @entity2 as referee @entity90 ignored calls for a foul			2
it was the sort of reaction commonly found at the @entity273 , but @entity274 has generated a similar feeling in @entity276 , after an extended public whinge about poor decisions costing his team			0
@entity67 saved from @entity55 , but @entity12 grew stronger as the first half progressed and their best moments revolved around @entity77 , and his desire to run at defenders			1
@entity52 and @entity175 were cautioned for fouls on him and @entity90 ’s yellow card count was in double figures by the end			0
@entity48 thwarted @entity79 , @entity75 lashed a volley close and @entity70 beat @entity50 to a corner only to head wide			2
the @entity291 goalkeeper , who left @entity12 after winning the @entity97 in may , also saved a skiddy drive by @entity78 — but was unable to keep @entity9 at bay			1
@entity77 broke out of defence , rode an attempted trip by @entity53 and found @entity78			0
he released @entity79 who pulled his cross deep to @entity9			1
the @entity298 swept the ball into the net			0
it was his 12th in 14 games , but that is not where @entity21 has problems			0
it is at the other end , where it always has been			0
the heavens opened and @entity12 went under			2
@entity7 's second goal came after flowing move across the pitch - click here for more from our @entity3 @entity9 ( left ) ca n't hide his dismay after @entity7 's second goal and it meant @entity12 squandered another lead the top six in the @entity27 , with @entity7 leapfrogging @entity12 into fifth after their win at the @entity2 @entity3 by @entity319 - @entity318 1			1
he ’s played in 20 games this season and let @entity32 — the 25 - year - old @entity324 winger , who joined @entity7 for £ 4m in july — dominate the flank			1
@entity154 had a torrid afternoon up against @entity7 winger @entity32 2			1
since @entity29 ’s rant about bad refereeing , @entity328 ’s red card was rescinded , a clear penalty was n’t given at @entity332 , and it appeared @entity57 was also denied one yesterday			1
@entity75 is still showing wonderful incision , but his tally of two goals is four down on this stage last season			0
@entity21 ’s demeanour has also suggested some frustration at the player			0
@entity75 has struggled to recapture his form from last season for @entity12 so far this term 4			2
so much for a pass-fest			0
two of the most eye - catching sides in the division were involved in a fierce battle , managing 26 fouls and five bookings apiece .			2

@entity154 appeared to shove @entity57 in box during first half but nothing was given
@entity9 gave @entity12 the lead with a smart finish after good work by @entity79
@entity40 equalised for @entity7 with a superb free - kick after 74 minutes
@entity34 headed the second for the hosts two minutes after coming on as substitute
