the case prompted surrogacy to be regulated in the @entity1 , as companies were banned from brokering deals between couples and potential mothers for profit			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' i always have mixed emotions on @entity38 's birthday			1
it 's a funny , wistful feeling			2
' i feel very cheated i never met her parents			1
the joy of handing a child over and seeing the joy on their faces ...			2
that 's the sad part			2
there 's always that regret			2
' mrs @entity6 , who used her own egg to conceive the child and the sperm of a man whose wife was infertile , was forced to leave the baby in hospital after she was made a ward of court			1
' it was absolutely shocking , ' she said			2
' it 's a feeling i ca n't put into words			2
i was heart - broken			1
' i put it in a box , shut it and rarely open it			2
some things are too painful			0
i think how naive i was			1
' mrs @entity6 , now a grandmother - of - five , agreed in her contract not to contact @entity38 after she was adopted by the couple			1
she said : ' i always felt that if she wanted to find me , i 'm well known enough and there is @entity72 and social media			1

in 1991 , she carried twins for an infertile friend			1
while there have been more than 980 surrogate births in the @entity1 , mrs @entity6 believes the £ 12 - 15,000 expenses payments for surrogate mothers is ' a pittance ' and not enough to attract more volunteers to cover the current shortfall			1
she has called for a more formal support network for surrogate mothers and a change to the system which currently means couples must obtain a parental order to be regarded as the surrogate baby 's legal parents , rather than the natural mother			1
' there 's a massive challenge of getting people to volunteer , ' she said			0
' i do n't know what puts people off			0
it may be there 's a lack of knowledge			0

' @entity1 law is so slow moving that it 's often years behind advances in medical science			0
infertility is a growing problem			0
