they are the @entity1 holders , the @entity3 holders and the @entity5 holders and @entity6 can add another trophy to their growing haul if they lift the @entity9 on december 20			1
@entity11 's team arrived in @entity12 on sunday and play their semi-final on tuesday			1
here 's our guide to the trophy only one @entity18 team has been able to win			2
this is the second consecutive year @entity12 has staged the tournament			2
@entity31 will host the next two versions of the competition			2
any chance of a host victory ? no. @entity36 were knocked out by @entity37 on day one			0
but the locals do n't mind too much			0
they will all support @entity6 now			2
@entity39 and , above all , @entity21 are the local favourites			0
@entity11 , the head coach of @entity6 , arrives at the team hotel in @entity42 , @entity12 @entity21 is ushered into his hotel as @entity6 's squad arrive in @entity12 and on a run of 20 straight victories , are @entity6 are the overwhelming favourites ? the pitches and their own injury problems may end up being their biggest obstacles			1
they sent their @entity52 groundsman @entity51 to look over the pitch at @entity42 but the game on tuesday - against @entity55 , from @entity56 - has already been moved to @entity28 after heavy rain left the surface in a ' farcical ' condition			2
because they are already without @entity61 ( thigh ) until march and @entity39 with a less serious calf injury the last thing they need is another man down			0
@entity6 's @entity67 semi-final against @entity69 has been moved to @entity28 after rain left the @entity42 pitch in a ' farcical ' condition apart from local support , will @entity6 have @entity74 backing ? there are around 8,000 @entity74 in @entity12 and some will travel for the tournament from @entity74			1
packages cost around £ 950 for the whole tournament and £ 300 to fly in and see just the final and then fly out again			2
will @entity6 definitely reach the final ? they will have to beat @entity55 , who won the @entity81 against @entity82 but have failed to reach the play - offs contested by the top eight teams in @entity56 this season			1
@entity55 will face @entity6 after they beat @entity86 and if @entity6 do reach the final , who will they face ? the @entity90 's team – @entity91			1
they beat @entity94 's @entity93 in the @entity95 to win the tournament for the first time in their 106 - year history and end a five - year run of @entity102 domination			1
if they beat @entity37 in the semi-final they will stand between @entity6 and their first @entity9			1
@entity37 players celebrate beating @entity12 side @entity36 on penalties have @entity6 ever won it before ? well yes and no. they won the tournament 's predecessor - the @entity112 - three times in 1960 , 1998 and 2002			1
how have @entity18 teams fared ? badly			0
@entity114 won the old @entity112 in 1999 and the @entity9 in 2008 but no other @entity18 team has won either tournament since it began in 1960			0
@entity119 ( twice ) , @entity117 and @entity118 were all runners - up in the early @entity121			0
and @entity119 again in 2005 and @entity122 in 2012 were also beaten finalists			0
@entity114 won the @entity9 back in 2008 , the only @entity18 club to do so how badly do @entity6 want this ? it 's one thing calling yourself the best team in the world but if you win the @entity9 then it 's official			1
this is one of five trophies they can win this season			0
the @entity3 is in the bag , @entity136 , the @entity5 and the @entity1 could all follow			0
and as an added incentive @entity140 won this trophy in 2009 and 2011 , so there is ground to be made up on the old enemy .			0

@entity11 's men will face @entity55 after they beat @entity86
@entity6 are *aiming* to win this version of the competition for the first time
