by @entity0 the sister of murdered schoolgirl @entity2 yesterday attacked the ‘ incestuous ’ relationship between senior politicians and the @entity6			1
@entity7 , 28 , said she wanted to make sure ‘ something good ’ came out of the phone hacking scandal and called on @entity9 to keep his promises over press regulation			1
revelations that the @entity14 hacked @entity16 ’s phone during the hunt for her sparked outrage and were a major factor in the decision to launch the @entity21 into press standards			1
‘ but now that it ’s over , i want to speak out about what i think should happen next to make sure that something good comes out of these terrible events , ’ she said			2
‘ ordinary people have suffered terribly from journalists who recklessly intruded into private grief			1
’ she described @entity39 , the new watchdog backed by most of the industry , as meaningless , adding : ‘ this is just the newspapers looking after themselves			1
’ the decision not to vet @entity44 to the highest level when he entered government was taken by top civil servant sir @entity47			2
@entity44 received only a basic security check when he moved from his opposition role at the @entity51 party headquarters into @entity52 as director of communications in may 2010			2
but he was not required to undergo ‘ developed vetting ’ which would have meant answering searching questions about his private life and time at the @entity14 and the @entity58 civil servant sir @entity47 was @entity52 ’s permanent secretary , responsible for decisions on staff security screening			0
he took the view that full vetting was not required for @entity44 , even though it had been for his predecessors			0
in november 2010 he changed his mind – but @entity44 resigned in january 2011 before the developed vetting process was complete			0
@entity14 proprietor @entity68 apologised to the @entity7 family and they were given £ 2million in an agreed compensation settlement , with a further £ 1million to a charity in @entity16 ’s memory			1
but the most shocking allegation made in the @entity76 newspaper – that an employee of the now defunct tabloid deliberately deleted messages on her phone to make room for more , giving her family false hope she was alive – turned out to be untrue			0
speaking on the video at a press conference organised by @entity86 , which campaigns for state - imposed press regulation , miss @entity7 said : ‘ there are other , equally worrying , problems			1
most important and damaging of all is the incestuous relationship between our top politicians and the @entity6			0
‘ for example @entity93 , the prime minister when @entity16 disappeared , did n’t phone us when he heard that @entity16 ’s phone had been hacked			0
but when he heard that the police were investigating ( former @entity14 editor ) @entity98 , he phoned her to offer his support			0
‘ three long years have passed since my meeting with @entity9 and the other party leaders			0
‘ we were pleased that he was prepared to initiate the @entity21 into press ethics			1
however , i have not forgotten the promises that were made			0
’ mr @entity9 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ his response ... will firstly be to acknowledge the pain , suffering and distress that victims have suffered			1
’ murder victim : the family of @entity2 ( pictured ) received a payout , though the claim which forced the closure of the @entity14 - that journalists deleted voicemails on her phone - turned out not to be true @entity121 ’s mother @entity120 was the victim of phone hacking , it was reported yesterday			2
mrs @entity121 , the @entity124 and the @entity125 were all targeted by hackers at the @entity14 , the @entity123 claimed .			0
