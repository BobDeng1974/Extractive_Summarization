president @entity0 arrived in the @entity1 on thursday to promote the fight against climate change - but felt he could n't make his point without the help of two glamorous @entity7 actresses			1
as president of @entity7 , @entity0 carries a fair amount of clout in political circles , but in this instance he brought @entity13 and @entity14 along to bolster his case			1
the two - day trip , the first by a @entity7 president to the @entity1 , is part of @entity0 's campaign to build diplomatic momentum ahead of the @entity23 event that @entity7 will host in december			1
@entity7 president @entity0 walks past a @entity1 honour guard as he arrives at a military airbase in @entity26 glamorous : in an effort to raise awareness about the climate change fight while in the @entity1 , @entity0 brought with him @entity30 winner @entity13			1

the @entity1 is seen as a frontline state in the battle against climate change , having been battered by relentless storms in recent years that have emerged from the @entity52 and claimed many thousands of lives			2
these included @entity55 , the strongest storm ever recorded on land , which left more than 7,350 people dead or missing in november 2013 and which scientists have linked to climate change			2
@entity0 will meet with @entity1 president @entity61 on thursday evening , when they are expected to jointly call on world leaders to ensure that the @entity65 climate summit is a success			1
the goal of the planned @entity65 pact , which must enter into force by 2020 , is to limit warming to two degrees @entity71 ( 3.6 degrees @entity72 ) over pre-industrial revolution levels			0
scientists warn that on current trends , @entity75 is on track for double that , or more - a recipe for catastrophic droughts , fiercer storms like @entity82 , and other extreme weather events			0
however most followers of the @entity23 climate change diplomatic process are sceptical a pact can be secured that will be ambitious enough to achieve the two - degree goal , with rich and poor nations continuing to fight over who should shoulder more of the burden			2
