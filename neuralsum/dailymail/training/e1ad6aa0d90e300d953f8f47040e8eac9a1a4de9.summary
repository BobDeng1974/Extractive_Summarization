by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 01:39 est , 3 october 2012 he is the hungry little feline who has been voted the @entity4 's favourite celebrity cat			0
and his animated adventures have notched up almost 300 million views on @entity8			1
now @entity9 - the purring pal of award - winning @entity13 - based animator @entity11 in both his first full - length colour book and an accompanying animation , seen here in a @entity18 exclusive			1
@entity9 told @entity18 : ' this time around i 've spent longer on each drawing which has resulted in really detailed illustrations , much more detailed than drawings in my previous books			2
' combined with the colour it makes each page have more depth			0
there are many more things to discover on subsequent visits to the book that you might not catch first time around			0
' the book follows on from 2009 's @entity9 : in his very own book ( 2009 ) , @entity9 : beyond the fence ( 2010 ) , @entity49 : in @entity51 ( 2011 ) , and a mini colour slip book , @entity9 : @entity53 , published earlier this year			1
@entity9 gets a fright in the garden when a bird box is not quite what he expected ...			2
. at the end of the new online video there is a sneak preview of how the colour book will look a spokesman for its publishers , @entity65 , said : ' the other stories have been about @entity9 and his owner , @entity22 , and have seen new characters being introduced gradually			1
' in this one he takes himself a bit further in the garden and tries to make his place in the world and become the boss of his own story ... often failing			0
' the accompanying preview video , seen exclusively below , features the cheeky chappie attacking a bird house up a tree in the garden ... and being surprised by what he finds inside			0
at the end of the video - which is in the series ' standard monochrome format - there is a colour sneak preview of what the book will look like			2
this still from the video shows what the new book , @entity22 's @entity21 , will look like in colour @entity22 's cat finds himself in more furniture - busting scrapes in @entity9 's new book @entity9 , 39 , launched the animated adventures of @entity9 on @entity8 in 2008			1
his cartoon pet has since become an online star , with his own channel proving the third most popular series on the site and racking up over one million subscribers			1
hilarious animations - which are , as any cat - owner knows , absurdly realistic - include @entity109 , @entity110 ! , tv dinner and @entity112			2
the 15 mini features , which usually run to up to three minutes per episode , see @entity22 's pet using increasingly dramatic measures to get the attention of his owner in effort to be fed , let inside the house or played with			1
@entity22 's cat practices yoga and takes a trip to the vet in @entity9 's colourful new book , @entity22 's @entity21 @entity9 with his animated creation , @entity9 why has @entity9 now gone in to colour ? i 've actually been creating colour @entity9 drawings for a while already and posting them on the @entity9 website			1
colour lets me more accurately portray animals , which are very important to the world of @entity9			2
personally i love looking at wildlife and nature , and getting the colours right on birds and other fauna is a great pleasure for @entity141 do you think it will be successful ? it 's not only the colour that i have worked on in my new book			0
this time around i 've spent longer on each drawing which has resulted in really detailed illustrations , much more detailed than drawings in my previous books			0
combined with the colour it makes each page have more depth			0
there are many more things to discover on subsequent visits to the book that you might not catch first time around			0
it 's definitely fun to look through , and i even surprise myself when i spot something i 'd forgotten i 'd @entity163 is interesting about this film in particular ? without giving too much away , it is a film that shows how a cat 's curiosity can sometimes have unexpected results ! are there any plans to make the @entity9 films in colour one day ? for the time being the @entity9 films online will remain in black and white			1
the films have a signature look and style that people recognise , understand and are comfortable with			0
the films are short - one to two minutes long - and simplicity is an asset in films of this length			0
that 's not to say we 'll never see colour in a @entity9 film			1
there have been experiments ... @entity9 received his first cat , a stray rescued from a farmer 's barn , at the age of nine			1
he has since had four cats , with the youngest , @entity195 , being the primary inspiration behind this new book			0
@entity9 was voted the @entity4 's favourite celebrity cat at this year 's @entity199			2
he also starred in an exhibition at @entity13 's @entity201 , alongside @entity203 's @entity202 and @entity204			0
