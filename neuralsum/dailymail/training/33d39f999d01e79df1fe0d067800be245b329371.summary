by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:59 am on 22nd june 2011 more than a million public service workers are poised to launch the ‘ fight of their lives ’ with a ‘ sustained ’ series of strikes to oppose cuts to their pensions			1
the leader of @entity12 ’s largest union yesterday issued a defiant ‘ call to arms ’ and urged members to prepare for a rolling programme of strikes over the autumn designed to ‘ weaken ’ the @entity17			1
@entity18 , general secretary of public sector union @entity19 , said his members would co-ordinate action with 11 local government unions and 19 health unions			1
waging war : unison general secretary @entity18 issued a ' call to arms ' to his one million members while speaking at the conference in @entity28 today delegates at @entity19 ’s annual conference in @entity28 are today expected to vote for a strike ballot to be held across its 1.2million membership			1
it includes nurses and council staff such as dinner ladies and social workers			1
public sector pensions are far more generous than those for private sector workers			2
the ‘ autumn of discontent ’ is being threatened over @entity17 plans for public sector workers to pay more into their pension scheme and receive less on retirement			1
mr @entity18 revealed that @entity19 had built up a £ 20million fighting fund for the action			1
in a keynote speech at the conference , he said : ‘ if this government fails to heed our warnings , to negotiate in good faith , i say to @entity53 , “ you ai n’t seen nothing yet			1
” ‘ we will strike to defend our pensions : a campaign of strike action without precedent			1
our preparations are well advanced , but there is more to do			2
’ symbolic dispute : miners march during the 1984 strike			2
after a year of action , however , they ran out of money as public support shrank he told delegates : ‘ strike action will need to be sustained			1
the fight of our lives may be an overused cliche , but that is what this is			2
’ @entity77 warned his @entity79 colleagues to stop ‘ bristling for a fight ’ with the unions			2
the deputy prime minister said he would stand in the way of anyone attempting to ‘ turn the clock ’ back to the 1980s and called for ‘ negotiation not confrontation ’			2
mr @entity18 was confident that ordinary people would not turn their backs on the public sector , adding that many in the health service and elsewhere were earning a ‘ pittance ’			1
support : members vote on a motion during the annual @entity19 conference			1
they have been told to ' prepare for action ' that could see a wave of strikes speaking at the @entity19 conference in @entity28 , he said that the extra money being taken from workers was being used to pay for the deficit and would not go to their pension funds			1
@entity19 president @entity109 also told the union 's annual conference that public sector workers were facing ‘ unprecedented ’ attacks on pay , jobs and pensions			2
she told delegates at the conference in @entity28 that workers were under ‘ assault ’ on a number of fronts , adding : ‘ on pensions , the government is determined to hit us with a triple whammy - they want us to pay more , work longer and then get less when we retire			2
’ mrs @entity109 , 41 , who works for @entity125 , said the economy was being ‘ dragged back ’ to recession and accused chancellor @entity128 of refusing to accept the need for a @entity130 , even though @entity131 ‘ was n't working ’			1
' this is more sick society , than @entity133 ' she continued : ‘ there is a refusal to learn from the pain experienced by our sisters and brothers in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , where austerity has simply driven the economy into ever - deeper crisis			2
‘ the effect is felt every day by real people			2
unemployment is huge , homelessness is on the rise , and spiralling inflation has meant that the poorest are once again the hardest hit			0
‘ one of the ways the government thinks it can save cash is by parcelling as many of our public services off to the private sector as possible			0
‘ this is despite the warnings we 've had in recent weeks from the appalling conditions at the private hospital in @entity165 , and from the fact that more than 30,000 elderly people face huge uncertainty about whether they will be turfed out on to the streets if @entity170 goes bust			0
‘ but these failures have not been taken on board - quite the opposite			0
the government now wants to do the same with the @entity176 in @entity177 and other key public services			0
this is more sick society than @entity133			0
’ unison members working in local government have already taken industrial action in protest at cuts to jobs and services , and mr @entity18 has said 1.3million workers could be balloted for strikes later in the year to defend their pensions			1
mr @entity18 today repeated his warning of strikes later in the year if there is no deal on pensions , saying that the action would be ‘ indefinite ’			1
the defeat of the miners in their 1984 strike was a seminal event in industrial history and is credited with helping to hasten the decline of @entity12 trade unions			0
like today ’s public sector workers , @entity12 ’s 300,000 miners back then were paid by the state , which owned the coal industry			0
it has since been privatised			0
the dispute pitted @entity209 prime minister @entity208 against equally resolute union leader @entity210 , who she blamed for bringing down the previous @entity79 government			0
struggle : mine union leader @entity210 vowed to destroy the government of @entity214 , who , blamed him for bringing down the last @entity79 administration in return , @entity210 vowed to not only stop planned pit closures , but also ‘ roll back the years of @entity222 ’ – which , like today , had seen a massive decline in public spending			0
the miners represented @entity12 ’s strongest union and so , when they downed tools in march 1984 , the stage was set for a battle that would make or break either the government or trade unionism			0
ultimately , the government won for three reasons			0
firstly , it had anticipated a strike and secretly built up stockpiles of coal in the years since its election in 1979			0
this meant the miners , despite being highly organised , were unable to disrupt industry in the same way as they had in 1974 , when power shortages led to @entity245 ’s government introducing a three - day week			0
secondly , the miners failed to maintain public support			0
they received a raft of donations at the beginning			0
conflict : the strike pitted miners against thousands of police officers but , by the end , as violence ensued and allegations of the strike being illegal intensified , people lost interest in backing the union ’s members			1
thirdly , because the strike dragged on so long , the union ran out of cash and member were dragged into poverty			0
the trickle of miners returning to work by the autumn had become a flood by the march 1985 , when the strike was finally called off			0
when unison general secretary @entity18 said his members ‘ will not be starved back like the miners ’ , this scenario is what he means			1
the union is therefore hopeful that it can maintain public support , have enough cash to bankroll industrial action and ensure that it has enough leverage against the @entity284 to win			1
if they lose , union bosses fear a new wave of privatisations and public sector reforms like those witnessed after the 1984 strike .			0
