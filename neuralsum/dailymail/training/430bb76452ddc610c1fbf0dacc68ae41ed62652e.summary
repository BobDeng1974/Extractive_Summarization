well , that is unless you 're a dissatisfied guest of the @entity6 in @entity7			1
after a string of critical comments were made on trip advisor about ' grubby rooms ' and ' nasty breakfasts ' , a former manager of the hotel began to respond to guests - telling them that they could hardly expect better given the cheap price of the hotel			1
writing under the name of ' georgianhouse1000 , owner at @entity21 ' , the unapologetic member of staff , named as @entity24 , hurled back retorts to the disgruntled customers			1
a string of critical comments were made on trip advisor about ' grubby rooms ' and ' nasty breakfasts ' at the hotel telling them that they ' pay little , they get little ' and refusing to apologise for their bad experiences , the staff member then told them to ' go the @entity38 ' if they wanted better food			1
it is now understood that the manager has left the hotel , which charges from £ 29.99 a night , after being dismissed by owner @entity45 , the @entity41 reported			2
one unhappy guest summarised their experience as nasty breakfast , grubby room ' , as they complained : ' the room , which was very small and cramped , and shower room were not cleaned during our 4 night stay , bins not emptied , glasses not washed , one towel each , not changed , no hand towels , no shampoo and the very cheapest hand wash and shower gel			0
' we had to go looking for a replacement toilet roll one night as there was none in our shower room ! ' the breakfast was terrible			0
a continental breakfast was ( laughingly ! ! ) served			0
' they signed off with the comment : ' altogether this was very disappointing , it was possibly the worst b and b accommodation i have ever stayed in			0
my advice would be to go elsewhere ! ' the customer is not always right : the criticisms were met with withering disdain from the staff member you pay little you get cheap : under the owner 's name , a staff member began criticising the reviewers but @entity84 fought back with : ' if you want a good breakfast go to the hilton and pay £ 100.00 a night			1
you pay little you get little			0
' one guest from @entity88 wrote : ' apart from the location , there is absolutely no positive remark we can make about @entity21			1
' we do not recommend anybody to stay at @entity21			1
' there are many other great hotels in the surroundings of @entity21 that are better ( and mostly cheaper as well ) ! ' but the former manager retorted : ' with only one person to look after the place what do you expect			1
think about what you paid			0
' one reviewer took to @entity104 to write : ' @entity106 location , with clean fresh beds ( which creaked terribly if you moved ) but lacking in everything else			0
' @entity110 were not friendly , in fact we hardly saw them apart from when they showed us to our room			0
' the staff member refused to accept responsibility for the complaints that guests had instead of apologising , the staff member retorted to criticism with asking customers not to demand so much to which the former manager responded : ' we are a cheap hotel so what do you expect			1
the current manager told @entity130 : ' that person has now left and there is a new manager			2
i do n't know anything else about it			0
' the hotel boasts that it offers a ' lovingly restored ' building in an excellent location			0
it says : ' if you are looking for a cheap hotel in the very best location in @entity7 you have found it ! ' the building is a lovingly restored @entity146 townhouse with single , double , twin and family en - suite rooms retaining many of the original architectural features			1
' this welcoming hotel gives you traditional , relaxed , informal comfort in the heart of @entity7 's @entity156			2
we have 11 well presented rooms and a dining breakfast room			2
' we offer first rate accomodation ( sic ) at excellent prices , we feel giving the best value in town in the best location in @entity7			2
