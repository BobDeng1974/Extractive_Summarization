by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 08:10 est , 30 january 2013 the new pro version of @entity4 's surface tablet will come out of the box with nearly two - thirds of its 64gb storage already used up , it emerged today			2
set for its @entity10 release next week , the $ 899 tablet computer will boot up with just @entity11 of usable space , while its @entity14 big brother will actually only have @entity15 free			1
the revelation is an embarrassment for @entity4 , with the lack of free space damaging claims its latest top of the range tablet could be a fully featured laptop replacement			1
not so spacious : @entity4 's @entity25 tablet , which will ship with more than two - thirds of its @entity28 storage space already used up by its operating system and pre-installed apps and it compares badly with tablet rival @entity32 's freshly announced @entity31 , which is expected to ship with @entity34 free for storing files and apps			1
the problem stems from the @entity25 's use of the full version of the @entity41 operating system , rather than the slimmed - down @entity42 installed on its cheaper siblings			0
@entity44 8 alone takes up @entity45 of space , but the @entity47 claims even more of the @entity25 's solid - state hard drive for a ' recovery partition ' to back up users ' data right there on their tablets			2
add to that the @entity25 's built - in apps and the trial version of @entity57 it ships with , and users of the @entity28 version will find most of their devices already full			0
other tablets , including the @entity31 , the @entity25 , and @entity64 - powered devices , run on specially slimmed down operating systems which dispense with much of the functionality of those found on laptop and desktop computers to save space			2
that means they are unable to run the same software as ' real ' computers and users must purchase apps that are specially designed for the tablet format			0
@entity4 had accordingly made great shakes of the @entity25 's ability to run full @entity44 versions of popular software packages , but the lack of space seems to contradict the company 's attempts to market the @entity87 - powered tablet as a laptop replacement			1
out next week : the revelation is an embarrassment for @entity4 , with the lack of free space damaging claims its latest top of the range laptop could be a fully featured laptop replacement with just @entity103 to work with , users who want to use the device for storage space - hungry applications like photo and video editing will quickly find their hard drives filling up			1
simply installing the latest version of @entity107 's @entity106 , a popular package of creative software , would take up a further @entity109 of that - without including the extra @entity111 recommended for a swap file			0
@entity4 was quick to point out that much of the used space on the box - fresh @entity25 can be reclaimed , @entity113 reported			0
however the method , which involves uninstalling packaged apps and moving or deleting the recovery partition , is likely to be difficult for computer novices to carry out			0
despite running a slimmed - down @entity44 , the @entity25 had a similar problem , shipping with about half its disk space already full			2
that resulted in a consumer backlash , although @entity4 insisted that the crunch was unavoidable			0
@entity4 will release the pro version of its surface tablet in @entity10 on february 9 with a price tag of $ 899 for the @entity28 version and $ 999 for the @entity14 version - making it the most expensive tablet computer in the world .			1

$ 899 tablet will start up with only @entity11 of usable space , while its $ 999 *128gb* big brother will actually have @entity135 available
lack of hard drive space damages @entity4 's claims that the @entity25 could work as fully featured laptop replacement
@entity32 's recently announced @entity31 , by contrast , is expected to ship with @entity34 free for storing apps and files
the @entity87 - powered , @entity44 8 running @entity25 is set for release in @entity10 on february 9
