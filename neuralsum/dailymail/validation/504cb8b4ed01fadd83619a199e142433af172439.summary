conservationists say dumping waste in reef waters damages it by smothering corals and sea grasses and exposing them to poisons and high levels of nutrients			0
the report said port expansions within reef waters , which it noted could see 1.8 billion cubic feet of the ocean floor dug up , would have ' devastating impacts ' on the natural wonder			0
the @entity5 is already popular , and often ranks as number one most appealing @entity21 attraction the report prepared by the consultancy @entity141 said there was no need for coal port expansions along @entity47 state 's coast - where the reef is located - as the capacity at existing terminals was unused one - third of the time			2
