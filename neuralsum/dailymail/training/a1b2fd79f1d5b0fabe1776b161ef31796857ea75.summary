wild dolphins around @entity1 have been found to have names identified by a unique whistle			1
experts say the discovery , which has previously only been seen in captivity , could shed new insight on how the animals communicate			0
they also say it could reveal if human 's are causing the animals to change their behaviour			1
these signature whistles are exchanged by groups of dolphins when they meet at sea and are used to address each other - similar to how humans use names			1
but it was unclear whether @entity28 bottlenose dolphins use a similar communication system , until now			1
the vast majority of research into how bottlenose dolphins communicate has been conducted in captivity or on animals who are restrained during the study			2
these have shown that each animal learns its own individually distinctive whistle , known as a signature whistle			2
these signature whistles are exchanged by groups of dolphins when they meet at sea and are used to address each other - similar to how humans use names			1
but it was unclear whether @entity28 bottlenose dolphins use a similar communication system , until now			1
a new study , published in @entity48 , has found that both species of bottlenose dolphin found in @entity1 and @entity51 ; the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) and the common bottlenose dolphin ( @entity54 ) , use a communication system based on signature whistles			1
' the population we study in @entity59 , @entity51 is a small , isolated population of common bottlenose dolphins , ' said project leader , dr @entity61 of the @entity62 and the @entity63 and @entity64			2
' currently , there are only around 100 animals in the population			0
@entity59 , has lots of man - made pressures , including coastal construction , shipping and marine tourism			2
' we are therefore concerned for their long - term welfare and capacity to cope with these stressors , ' the research provides an important stepping stone for future studies into how the sounds are used , and whether human activity is affecting communication in the small dolphin population			2
using a hydrophone – a microphone used for underwater recording – @entity61 and colleagues collected over 79 hours of recordings of signature whistles , alongside identification photos of the dolphins who made them			1
on analysing the data they found good evidence for signature whistle use			2
@entity61 fears that noise from the construction may block the dolphin 's signals making it harder for them to communicate with each other			0
' in the same way that the desert elephants or desert lions are small , locally adapted populations in @entity51 's terrestrial environment , the common bottlenose dolphins found along @entity51 's the coastline should be considered quite an important population and are locally threatened by coastal construction and marine tourism , ' she says			0
video @entity116 bottlenose dolphins use sound to find food and navigate , as well as communicate with each other			0
bottlenose dolphins can learn new sounds and can quickly mimic novel sounds that they hear			0
@entity128 , in the 1995 film version of the tv series - he was famously able to communicate with whistles bottlenose dolphins are an iconic marine species and one of the best studied dolphin species worldwide			1
but , research in @entity1 , especially on the larger truncatus form , is much more sparse			0
most dolphin species rely on a wide variety of sounds in their day to day lives			0
they use sound to find food and navigate , as well as communicate with each other			0
bottlenose dolphins can learn new sounds and can quickly mimic novel sounds that they hear			0
although fairly common among many bird species and humans , this ability , termed vocal production learning , makes them quite special amongst mammals			0

on analysing the data they found good evidence for signature whistle use			0
' we found that the number of different signature whistles recorded increased when group sizes were larger and when calves were present - something you might expect if signature whistles are used to address each other and help maintain contact between animals , particularly between mothers and calves , ' explains @entity61			1
the catalogue of whistles produced as part of this study will help researchers to build a better understanding of how human activity is affecting the dolphins			1
next , @entity61 is also hoping to look into whether these individually distinctive calls can be used to monitor how the dolphins use their habitats .			0
