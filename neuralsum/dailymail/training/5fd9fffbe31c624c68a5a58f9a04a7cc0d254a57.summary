@entity13 women walk 180 miles on average per year			1
that ’s the same as seven marathons			0
but it seems that for a third of women , all the hard work goes to waste because 33 per cent are snacking while shopping on calorific treats such as crisps , chocolate and biscuits			2
shop til you drop : women walk 180 miles shopping per year , which is the equivalent to seven marathons 31 per cent of consumers admit to eating over 250 calories while pounding the pavements , with one in ten eating up to 1,000 calories			1
the research also revealed that two thirds of women admit to being self - conscious in the changing rooms			1
in fact , 27 per cent are so worried about fitting into their clothes on a shopping trip that they reduce portions or even skip meals beforehand			0
what a waste ! for a third of women , all the hard work goes to waste because 33 per cent of women snack while shopping on calorific treats such as crisps , chocolate and biscuits and shopping with others just makes matters worse with more than a quarter claiming the company of friends is off putting , instead trusting the opinion of boyfriends and their mothers most			1
and although more of us are shopping online than ever before – internet shopping sales grew by 8.7 per cent last year – it actually seems that more women are concerned with giving their bodies a work out along with their wallets			0
the survey , carried out by @entity67 , showed that while many women are tempted by the ease of online shopping , being able to count it as an exercise workout would encourage 58 per cent to hit the high street rather than the keyboard .			0
