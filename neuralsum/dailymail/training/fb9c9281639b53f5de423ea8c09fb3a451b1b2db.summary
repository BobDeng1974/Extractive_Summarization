@entity0 and @entity1 are locked in a battle to curb police stop and search powers			1
the prime minister and home secretary are split over plans to limit the use of the powers and impose heavier punishments on officers who break the law			1
mrs may has warned the excessive use of stop and search is a ‘ dreadful waste of police time ’ and fears young black men being disproportionately targeted risks undermining public confidence in the police			1
clash : @entity0 fears @entity1 's plans to rein in the use of stop and search powers will make the @entity27 appear soft on crime in a damning report last year , @entity30 ’s @entity29 found more than a quarter of police stop and searches are ‘ unlawful ’ and risk promoting ‘ major disorder ’			1
in 27 per cent of cases , police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search			2
it is the equivalent of 250,000 people every year being stopped and subjected to hugely intrusive searches without the police sticking to the rules			1
official statistics show that , if someone is from a black or minority ethnic background , they are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than if they are white			1
mrs may has warned : ‘ if anybody thinks it is sustainable to allow that to continue , with all its consequences for public confidence in the police , they need to think again			0
’ risks : excessive use of the powers wastes 312,000 hours per year , mrs may believes she also believes a total of 312,000 hours per year — the equivalent of 145 full - time police officers – are taken up filling in forms recording searches			1
‘ at its best , stop and search is a vital power in the fight against crime ; at its worst , it is a waste of police timeand serves to undermine public confidence in the police			2
it is time to get stop and search right , ’ mrs may said in july			0
the government was due to respond to a consultation on reining in the powers by the end of the year			1
but the @entity80 is at loggerheads with @entity82 , which fears the @entity27 appearing soft on crime			1
in a bid to play down talk of a @entity87 split , mr @entity0 insisted at @entity88 that reforms to stop and search are needed			0
but he stressed @entity91 would only legislate if it was ' necessary '			0
he told @entity92 : ' stop and search does need reform because what the @entity29 report shows is that in 27 per cent of cases the police have not been following their own guidance in terms of stop and search			0
so , we do need to reform stop and search			0
if it is necessary to legislate , legislate , if it is not , we wo n't			0
' but what 's really important is that stop and search is used properly but we do n't add to the burdens of the police			0
' number 10 played down the suggestion it was blocking mrs may ’s flagship reforms , but insisted no final decision had been made			0
a @entity80 spokesperson said : ‘ nobody should ever be stopped just on the basis of their skin colour or ethnicity			2
‘ the government supports the ability of police officers to stop and search suspects , but it must be applied fairly and in a way which builds community confidence			2
‘ this is why we consulted over the summer on the powers of stop and search – and we received a strong response			2
we will respond to the consultation in due course			0

young black men 7 times more likely to be stopped than a white person
