@entity0 declared himself ready to compete for a fifth @entity2 title after completing 11 holes of practice at @entity5 on monday			1
@entity0 has started just two events in 2015 , shooting a career - worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on february 5			1
that led to the 14 - time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game , during which time he dropped outside the world 's top 100 for the first time since september 1996 , a slide which continued on monday as he fell from 104th to 111th			1
@entity0 returned to action as he warmed up at @entity5 ahead of @entity2 the 39 - year - old is returning from a self - imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at @entity5 @entity0 has not won a major since the @entity34 and the last of his four masters wins was a decade ago , with the 39 - year - old only confirming on friday that he would compete at @entity5			1
however , after showing no sign of the chipping ' yips ' which blighted his performance in @entity41 on the range , @entity0 produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long - time friend @entity44 before playing the 10th and 18th alone			1
it was nice to get out here , ' said @entity0 , who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three - putting the par - five second for a par. ' @entity53 is fine			1
i wanted to test out some wedges out here			1
that was why i was chipping a little bit more			1
it came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it 's different from @entity61			1
we figured the right one out			1
' it 's been a process			1
but i 'm on the good side now			1
i felt like i had to get my game into a spot where i could compete to win a golf tournament and it 's finally there			1
' @entity0 has not won a major since the @entity34 in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best woods stopped to chat to @entity75 's @entity74 captain @entity73 ( right ) at @entity5 on monday @entity44 , who won the masters and @entity34 in 1998 , said : ' the thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate @entity0			1
i 'm a huge fan , a friend and i care about him			1
' it was good to be out there with him			2
i saw some good signs			2
his pitching looks a lot better			2
' there 's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week			2
' there are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has			2
the game of golf is better because of @entity0			1
' he is in a good place and i think he is fired up about it			2
he will be nervous on thursday but i think he will be fine			2
he hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots			2
' earlier in the day , @entity34 champion @entity109 said he still felt @entity0 was ' the man , ' but added : ' who really knows what is going on in his head ? woods looked confident and managed to pull off some impressive drives in front of the crowd @entity0 hits a chip shot on to the green during the practice session ahead of the @entity120 @entity0 smiles during the practice round prior to the tee off of the 2015 masters on thursday ' i hope he 's happy			1
i hope he 's fine			0
i hope he will play well this week			0
but what would bother me a lot is all the speculation			0
you do n't have a choice ; you will read about it somewhere			0
you will hear about it because you socialise with people			0
' so mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf			0
it 's difficult and some things i do n't find very fair			0
you know , you should just let him be			0
let him play golf , what he likes to do			0
' sometimes i look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject			0
it should n't be like this in my opinion			0
but that 's how it is unfortunately			0
that is how a lot of people make their money and some athletes , they suffer because of that			0
' hopefully he 's strong enough , he has people to talk to , and he finds a way to compete as good as he can			0
because we all know when he 's around , somehow it does make us play better , as well			0
' i never experienced someone who played better than him			0
in my era , i never played with @entity166 ( @entity167 ) and i never played with @entity168 , @entity169 , those guys			0
so for me , what i have seen and what i have experienced , he 's the man			0
