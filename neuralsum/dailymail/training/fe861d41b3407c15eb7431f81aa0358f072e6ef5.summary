by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 13:52 est , 31 december 2013 @entity3 : 14:11 est , 31 december 2013 more trouble ahead ? @entity6 secretary @entity5 will likely face new questions after jan. 1 about how many -- or how few -- obamacare enrollees have made payments and are actually covered the @entity6 is in mid-victory - lap over its enrollment of an estimated 2.1 million @entity1 into @entity14 insurance plans , a figure claimed in a blog post tuesday by the @entity16			1
but as many as half of those customers have yet to make a payment , a new report suggests			0
the @entity21 interviewed @entity22 , the chief strategy officer at a firm that processes billings for insurers			0
he said that only about 50 per cent of enrollees in 17 states have paid their bills for the first month 's premium			1
that statistic , if it were to hold true across the nation , indicates that more than 1 million @entity1 counted in the @entity35 administration 's total are n't actually covered by medical insurance			1
@entity22 's statistics cover more than 100 health insurance companies , which typically do n't issue insurance cards or consider a new customer ' enrolled ' until they receive payments			1
but the @entity35 administration has included in its public numbers everyone who has selected a plan – regardless of whether they have paid for it			0
@entity48 , the administrator of the @entity16 , wrote tuesday on the agency 's blog that ' [ t ] he most recent data indicates that more than 2.1 million people nationwide have enrolled in a private health insurance plan through a new @entity55 since october 1			1
' that number would include enrollments from the @entity58 and from 14 states that do n't participate in the chronically troubled healthcare.gov website portal			0
but @entity22 's statement suggests that half of them either incorrectly believe they are insured , have n't received a bill , or are still deciding whether to pay			1
surge : as @entity60 's tech glitches were ironed out in december , more than 1 million new enrollees entered the system -- but how many of them have paid their bills ? think you 're covered ? better have one of these : more than 1 million @entity1 may expect insurance coverage on jan. 1 but have n't paid their premiums ' we have n't written a check yet , because no one has asked me for one , ' @entity75 , a @entity76 , @entity78 homemaker , told @entity83			1
' this could be a disaster if i get hit by a bus tomorrow , @entity84 forbid			0
' @entity6 secretary @entity5 blogged earlier on tuesday that enrollees are largely on their own if they 're not sure whether their sign - ups are complete			1
' if consumers have questions about their new private insurance coverage , they can contact their insurance company directly , ' wrote @entity5			2
few appear to have taken that advice			0
the @entity21 reported that one health plan based in @entity98 , @entity99 only received first month 's premiums from 35 of its new customers			2
some insurers expect customers to try to create their own proof of insurance			0
' we anticipate that people will be using screen printouts ' from insurance exchange websites , the @entity21 heard from @entity110 , vice president of government and community relations at @entity113 , a @entity114 insurer			0
bad air out , good air in : @entity16 chief operating officer @entity117 ( @entity118 ) has stepped down as the @entity14 website saga nears its end ; and @entity16 administrator @entity48 ( r ) now claims 2.1 million people have enrolled overall big picture : president @entity35 's public opinion ratings are still suffering from his false promises that @entity1 could keep their health care plans ; many of the new enrollees are those who lost coverage anyway @entity5 counseled @entity1 tuesday on her blog to ' get your insurance card or a temporary card with your new plan ’s information			1
' ' if you do n’t have your card yet , ask your insurance company to give you another way to confirm your coverage			2
' but for those @entity1 who have n't paid , that proof will be impossible to get			2
' it 's bad enough that the coverage is nearly twice as expensive as what my family had least year , ' said @entity75 , the perplexed @entity78			0
' but what good is the plan if i ca n't prove i 've signed up ? '			0

in a blog post on one of the year 's quietest news days , the @entity16 claimed 2.1 million sign - ups for @entity14
but an executive at a health insurance billing company says only half of enrollees have paid premiums in 17 states where his company has clients
that would leave more than 1 million @entity1 possibly thinking they 're insured on jan. 1 – but having no medical coverage at all
many of them are expected to bring website printouts to *doctor* 's offices instead of insurance cards , but it 's *unclear* how *physicians* will react
