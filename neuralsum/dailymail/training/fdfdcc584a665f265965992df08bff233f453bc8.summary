' everyone at @entity6 is looking forward to the first game of the new season at the @entity61 , where the famous @entity87 and @entity88 can show the world what being a @entity6 fan is all about - supporting with pride , passion and respect			2
' @entity96 words : owners @entity2 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) have called for calm ahead of the game @entity11 also moved to stress the need for proper conduct from their travelling supporters			1
