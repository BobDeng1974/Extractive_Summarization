aeroplanes are infamous as breeding grounds for bacteria , with tray tables , seats and blankets singled out as the worst offenders on board			1
but an entrepreneurial team are hoping their new invention will revolutionise the cleaning of aircraft and help airlines win the battle against bacteria @entity15 and @entity16 have created a robot , called the @entity18 , which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin			1
but the family team has developed the unusual new robot as a way to counter issues with cleaning the interior of a plane - which currently only takes place a few times a year			1
when the plane is parked and empty , the device , which is the size of a drinks cart , patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself			0
as it does , it spreads its two ' wings ' over the seats on either side			0
those wings contain @entity64 lamps , which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants			0
it also has @entity64 lamps on its top and sides			0
@entity15 and @entity16 , from @entity75 , said the 3.5billion people expected to fly this year risk falling ill due to poor plane hygiene			1
writing on their @entity80 page to raise money for their project , @entity16 said : ' germs will survive on aeroplane surfaces sometimes for as long as seven days			1
' there are no regulations or cleanliness standards for the passenger cabins of airplanes			2
aeroplane travelers are at heightened risk of catching the common cold , flu , or more serious infections			0
' they said their device could spare passengers from catching illnesses when flying and give airlines a competitive edge			0
last year a study from the @entity104 in @entity105 discovered disease - causing bacteria can survive for up to a week inside plane cabins , on surfaces such as seat pockets , tray tables , window shades and armrests			2
when the plane is parked and empty , the device , which is the size of a drinks cart , patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself			0
as it does , it spreads its two ' wings ' over the seats on either side @entity124 ( @entity37 ) , a bacteria that could cause infections , skin disease , pneumonia and sepsis , lived the longest ( 168 hours )			2
@entity35 ( @entity35 ) , which can cause urinary tract infection , respiratory illness and diarrhoea , was found to survive for 96 hours			0
@entity16 added : ' the industry is growing aggressively			1
implementing daily , routine airplane sanitization could disrupt or limit the rate bacteria and viruses spread , as the industry grows			2
' we have created an efficient and practical way for airlines to sanitize the interiors of commercial planes between passenger loads			1
its wings contain @entity64 lamps , which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants			0
it also has @entity64 lamps on its top and sides using @entity64 light they have have proven a 99.99 per cent germ - kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials ' using uv - c light , we have proven a 99.99 per cent germ - kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials			1
the @entity18 is programmed to reach the most commonly touched passenger surfaces and kill all germs that are exposed to the robot 's sanitising lights			1
' the robot , which contains settings for sanitising toilets and galleys , also comes with fans and filters to clean the air and suck in dust particles			2
the @entity178 , who have been working on the robot for several years , are about to start work on their fourth and final prototype before going into commercial production			0
they are currently seeking sponsorship via @entity80 and are offering backers the chance to fly on the first completely clean flight .			1

@entity80 campaign claims to have developed way to *sterilise* planes
bacteria can linger in aeroplanes for up to seven days
there are no cleaning regulations for the interiors of aircraft
robot created by father and son team @entity15 and @entity16
project involves using uv light to kill bacteria
