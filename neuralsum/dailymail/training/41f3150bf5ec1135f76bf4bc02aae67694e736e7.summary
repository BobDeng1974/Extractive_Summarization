@entity59 reading : chancellor @entity31 ( left ) has staked his political and economic credibility on clearing up the mess left by @entity7 but the forecasts are grim for him and @entity30 ( right ) and raise the prospect of the next two general elections being fought against a backdrop of austerity after coming to power in may 2010 , mr @entity31 pledged to eradicate the budget deficit within five years - far faster than planned by @entity7			2
