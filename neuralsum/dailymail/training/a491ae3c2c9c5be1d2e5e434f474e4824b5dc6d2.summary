by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the @entity1 are fully behind @entity3 ’s intention to put up a candidate to fight @entity5 for the @entity7 presidency in next year ’s election			1
@entity11 football ’s ruling body believe anything is better than @entity5 , 78 , being handed a fifth term in office and will support whoever @entity3 decide should stand			1
the @entity1 stance is similar to their position during the last @entity7 election in 2011 , when former @entity1 chairman @entity20 stood alone in making a congress speech opposing @entity5 standing alone for the presidency			1
out ! the @entity1 are behind @entity3 ¿ s intention to put up a candidate to fight @entity5 @entity5 , who is likely to announce he wants to carry on at the @entity7 congress in @entity25 after receiving stage - managed endorsements from a number of confederation leaders , is almost certain to win with many votes already in the bag			1
but if , as expected , @entity3 chief @entity32 does n’t stand , several credible @entity31 are said to be prepared to take on @entity5			1
the @entity1 , @entity11 and @entity34 management all give a stock answer to the lack of use by the national team of their £ 100million training centre outside @entity41			1
they are there for two days in the @entity44 build - up			2
the glib excuse is that @entity46 was not meant just for the senior side but constructors @entity49 , who built the state - of - the - art facility , are among those perplexed at its lack of use by the squad			2
@entity59 play - off losers @entity41 , on the other hand , are at @entity46 four times a week			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. certain blazers on the @entity1 international committee have accompanied @entity11 for entire tournaments			1
but this summer chairman @entity64 , aware of his @entity66 commitments , will be in @entity67 for only a short period , as will @entity70 ’s @entity69			1
committee men @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 will rotate duties between @entity78 and @entity79			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. relationships between the @entity1 and the @entity81 are always strained and the sexist emails saga will only add to that			0
@entity84 , a @entity81 representative on the @entity1 , made it clear at a special meeting before the @entity1 council last week how annoyed he was about @entity1 independent director @entity88 saying in public that @entity81 chief executive @entity92 should ‘ consider his position ’			2
@entity93 could hardly remain silent when she chairs the @entity1 inclusion board , whose members had been the most vocal on the affair			0
@entity88 has now been mandated by chairman @entity98 to lead for the @entity1 on inclusion discussions with @entity92			0
the @entity81 are still considering whether to complain to the police over temporary secretary @entity101 selling the email exchanges involving @entity92 and lawyer @entity103 to the @entity104			0
they have the backing of clubs to do so			0
it is thought @entity108 viewed as many as 900 emails in @entity92 ’s personal premierleague.com account			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity111 ’s a no - show ... @entity113 and his excitable @entity115 assistant @entity114 were due to attend the @entity117 play - off and had seats reserved at the pre-match lunch in the @entity120			1
it is understood they would watch @entity124 striker @entity123 , a loan signing from @entity115			1
but neither showed up and @entity123 played only a minute of @entity124 ’s defeat by @entity127 after coming on as a substitute in added time			2
no show : @entity113 and @entity131 were due to watch @entity123 ( right ) at @entity132 on saturday @entity124 ’s defeat stopped the character that is @entity134 enlivening @entity81 chairmen ’s meetings next season			0
despite his dislike for dressing up , the @entity139 entrepreneur , who owns a quarter of @entity124 , wore a tie to conform to the @entity120 dress code but teamed it with leather jacket , jeans and trainers			0
nobody from the @entity132 style police dared to object			0
@entity115 are spending around £ 4m on improving their sports science set - up at their @entity150 training base , digging underground to construct the basement facilities to conform with planning restrictions			1
the club are also laying two @entity154 pitches identical to the new @entity156 surface			0
upgrade : @entity115 are spending around £ 4m on improving their sports science set - up at their @entity150			1

@entity11 football ’s ruling body believe anything is better than @entity5 , 78
elections take place next year , and @entity3 are planning to put up a candidate
@entity32 not expected to stand against @entity5
@entity66 chief @entity64 will only stay in @entity67 for short period
@entity115 are spending £ 4m to improve @entity150 *'s* sports science set - up
