@entity1 ’s environmental woes are common knowledge to most of the world ; take a trip to @entity5 and you ’ll quickly see the effects deforestation can have on a city ’s way of life			1
there , toxic dust clouds and high levels of pollution threaten the lives of people on almost a daily basis			2
but the @entity1 government has an ambitious plan to improve conditions			2
for several decades they have been planting a ‘ great wall of trees ’ to block the impacts from the @entity28 - and a study says the measures are working , despite previous criticism			1
scroll down fir video @entity1 is planting huge strips of trees to stop the @entity28 ( illustration shown )			1
for decades the desert has been advancing and causing serious dust storms to key cities such as @entity5			1
since 1978 the government has been planting trees to reverse the widespread deforestation that took place in @entity1 the @entity40 , more commonly known as the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , is a series of huge forest strips designed to hold back the expansion of the @entity28			1
every spring the country is subjected to devastating sand storms as winds sweep down from the @entity48 , bringing the @entity28 with them			1
and as the desert expands - partly due to human deforestation to make room for agriculture , livestock and mining - the situation had the potential of getting worse and worse			2
this project , also known as the @entity40 , is being carried out in the @entity48 , @entity59 and @entity60 of @entity1			2
it is designed to halt the expansion of the @entity28			2
by 2050 , strips of trees and vegetation 2,800 miles ( 4,500km ) long will have been planted , covering about a tenth of the country in greenery			1
several methods have been employed to increase vegetation			0
in some instances , farmers have been given cash incentives to plant trees and shrubs			0
in the last decade , aerial seeding has been used to cover wide areas of land			0
there have been criticisms of the project , though			0
some say the trees may soak up large amounts of valuable groundwater , weakening the soil and preventing people from getting suitable access to water			0
in 1978 , though , @entity1 made a bold decision to begin the @entity41 project - and it seems they are now beginning to reap the benefits of that decision			1
by 2006 , 25 million hectares of forest were growing			0
by 2050 , more than 100 billion trees will occupy a 2,800 - mile ( 4,500km ) belt , 1.6 million squre miles ( 4.1 million square km ) , more than a tenth of the country			1
critics have suggested the plans are ultimately doomed to fail ; @entity102 of the @entity103 at @entity104 , told @entity105 : ‘ instead of controlling nature , we need to follow nature			0
’ and some think that planting trees in the sandy ground of the @entity28 will not work , with the mortality rate of the trees being unknown			1
this means the longevity of the project has been called into question , with continual replanting of trees required long into the future to maintain their effectiveness			2
but the latest study , led by dr @entity122 from the @entity123 , says the measures are working - and they will continue to do so			0
every spring some of @entity1 's cities , such as @entity5 ( shown on 9 april 2014 ) , are ravaged by dust storms that make their way @entity129 from the @entity28 desert			1
it is hoped that the @entity41 project will improve the quality of life for the people living in cities like this pictured are workers planting part of the shelterbelt at the @entity142 of @entity144 shelterbelt forest in @entity145 , northwest @entity1 's @entity138 , on 23 july 2013			1
@entity1 launched the @entity146 in 1978 as an anti-desertification effort ‘ the results show that in the @entity41 region , vegetation has greatly improved , while it varied dramatically outside the @entity41 region , ’ the researchers write in their paper			2
of most importance , though , is how this vegetation has affected dust storm intensity ( @entity157 ) and dust storm frequency ( @entity159 )			1
according to the study , things are looking good			0
since 1985 @entity157 has decreased dramatically , while @entity159 has also been decreasing continuously			0
‘ from this result , we infer that the implementation of the @entity41 programme has effectively decreased @entity157 by improving the vegetation conditions , ’ they write			0
this photo taken on 27 july 2013 shows the shelterbelt forest at the @entity168 , northeast @entity1 's @entity169			0
@entity171 ( @entity172 ) data showed that the forest coverage in the treated areas had increased to 12.4 per cent at the end of 2012 from 5.05 per cent in 1977 while the overall situation seems to be improving , there are some small areas where little or no improvement has been seen			0
others have warned that the project could take hundreds of years to successfully turn back the advancing deserts to a significant degree			0
this project is not unprecedented , though ; in the @entity186 in 1934 , president @entity185 initiated the @entity188 project to try to quell the severe dust storms plaguing @entity190			1
by 1942 , 220 million trees had been planted , stretching 18,600 miles ( 19,900km ) from the @entity192 in @entity193 to @entity194			0
the project was widely viewed as a success , although a lack of maintenance today means the severe dust storms are threatening to return			1
and in @entity203 a project , the @entity41 of the @entity199 and the @entity200 ( @entity201 ) , is also hoped to improve the droughts and natural resources degradation threatening countries in @entity203			0
keen eyes will remain on @entity1 ’s project to see how successful it will be , as other countries also begin to suffer the effects of deforestation .			2

@entity1 is planting huge strips of trees to stop the @entity28
for decades the desert has been advancing and causing serious dust storms in key cities such as @entity5
since 1978 the government has been planting trees to reverse the widespread deforestation that took place in @entity1
now a recent study suggests the project has been a success
they found increased vegetation and lower levels of dust storm intensity
by 2050 100 billion trees will be planted across a tenth of the country
