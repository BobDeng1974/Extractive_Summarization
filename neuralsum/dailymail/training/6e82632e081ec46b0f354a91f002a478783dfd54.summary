by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 today stepped in to order an end to an extraordinary public feud between @entity5 and @entity6			0
it follows mrs may , the home secretary , launching a thinly - veiled attack on education secretary mr @entity6 over his handling of the @entity13 schools scandal			1
@entity14 today insisted that the two departments had been told to focus on tackling @entity17 extremism in schools , and stop briefing against each other			2
home secretary @entity5 ( left ) has called for tougher controls on extremism in schools in a letter to education secretary @entity6 ( right ) following the alleged ' @entity13 ' plot in @entity26 in a letter to mr @entity6 , mrs may called for tougher rules to tackle @entity17 extremism in schools and asked why action was not taken sooner			1
a total of 21 schools in @entity26 have been inspected since allegations that @entity36 hardliners were attempting to seize control of school boards in the city			1
after police , @entity40 and @entity41 launched investigations , a letter emerged in which mrs may appeared to question mr @entity6 's response			1
she wrote : ' is it true that @entity49 was warned about these allegations in 2008 ? is it true that the @entity52 was warned in 2010 ? if so , why did nobody act ? ' i am aware that several investigations are still ongoing and those investigations are yet to conclude			2
but it is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools			2
' it triggered an immediate trading of insults from rival sources in the two government departments			0
a source close to mr @entity6 complained of a reluctance by the @entity72 to tackle the problem			0
' @entity74 recognised this space			0
within government there has been pushback against doing that			0
' @entity80 [ counter-terror chief at the @entity72 ] always believed if extremists become violent we should deal with it			2
' it has been characterised by others in government as just beating back the crocodiles that come close to the boat rather than draining the swamp , ' the source told @entity92			0
the between two senior @entity94 row is tricky for @entity2 , who hoped to focus on the @entity95 but a @entity72 source hit back : ' why is the @entity52 wanting to blame other people for information they had in 2010 ? lord knows what more they have overlooked on the subject of the protection of kids in state schools ? it scares me			2
' in an attempt to calm the row , the two departments were ordered to issue a joint statement , saying : ' extremism anywhere in society is a serious problem and we are working together across @entity116 to deal with it			1
' that was shown by the work of the prime minister ’s @entity120			2
there is no difference between the @entity124 and the home secretary , who are both working energetically together to tackle the challenge posed by any form of extremism			1
' in a sign of @entity133 's irritation , the prime minister ’s official spokesman added : ' what the two departments are doing , as their statement this morning says , is working together to get to the bottom of this			1
' the important thing here is getting to the bottom of serious concerns that have been raised with regard to a number of schools in the @entity26 area			1
that is the focus , and rightly so			0
' a government task force on tackling extremism last year recommended a voluntary code of conduct to prevent children being exposed to ' intolerant or extremist views ' in religious schools			2
but mrs may said the @entity26 allegations showed the potential need for a mandatory code and urged mr @entity6 to include that option in his plans			2
mrs may wrote : ' [ since ] december there have been serious allegations of extremism in some @entity26 schools and accusations about the inability of local and central government to tackle the problem effectively			1
@entity169 , which is at the centre of some of the most serious allegations , has criticised the ' unwarranted and unnecessary concern ' caused by leaks from the investigation ' in this context , i am not convinced that a voluntary code is sufficient and i believe it would be sensible to include the option of developing a mandatory code in your consultation document			0
' mrs may said the @entity26 allegations ' raise serious questions about the quality of school governance and oversight arrangements in the maintained sector , not just the supplementary schools that would be signatories to this code of practice '			1
mrs may and mr @entity6 moved to damp down speculation over a row within the @entity195 today , issuing a joint statement			0
the so - called @entity13 plot first came to light earlier this year			2
@entity52 inspectors were ordered into @entity169 in @entity26 along with its sister schools , @entity202 and @entity203 , after a letter dubbed ' @entity13 ' was uncovered			1
it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and @entity211 pupils forced to ' teach themselves '			2
the letter , which some have claimed is fake , prompted separate investigations by both the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) and @entity40 in to the school and several others in the area			1
the @entity52 has also appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the @entity222 ’s counter-terrorism unit @entity220 for the investigation			0
the @entity224 said it had ‘ serious concerns ’ about attempts to ‘ alter the character ’ of at least six schools - warning the ' plot ' was spreading across the country			0
it said : ' the @entity52 and the @entity72 take the problems in @entity26 schools and all issues relating to extremism very seriously			1
' @entity6 and @entity5 are working together to ensure we get to the bottom of what has happened in @entity26 and take the necessary steps to fix it			2
' and a source close to the @entity124 said : ' @entity6 thinks @entity5 is a superb home secretary			1
' we will continue to work well with the @entity72 and other government departments to combat extremism in all its forms			0
' of the 21 schools inspected over the alleged @entity13 plot by hardline @entity36 to seize control of classrooms , three have so far been given a clean bill of health by @entity40			1
@entity249 , an @entity250 in @entity251 , @entity252 , and @entity250 are the first to publish the results of their inspections , after mr @entity6 sent @entity40 in			1
@entity169 has been the focus of the most damning allegations after whistleblowing teachers claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body			0
but @entity265 trust , which runs the school and three others in the city , has denied any wrong - doing			0
trust chairman @entity269 , who was accused of being part of the plot , has called the allegations ' a witch - hunt '			0
the school said leaked @entity40 findings were causing ' unwarranted and unnecessary concern ' for children and parents			1
@entity269 , who has been implicated in the conspiracy involving the alleged takeover of schools in @entity26 , has called the investigation a ' witch - hunt ' it came as 20 educationalists said the snap inspections called after the claims had ' tarnished ' @entity40 's reputation			1
in a letter to the @entity293 , a group of experts including sir @entity291 , a former chief education officer , said : ' first - hand accounts of the @entity40 inspections that have emerged are disturbing			1
' they suggest that inspectors were poorly prepared and had an agenda that calls into question @entity40 's claim to be objective and professional in its appraisal of standards in schools serving predominately @entity36 pupils			1
' it is beyond belief that schools which were judged less than a year ago to be outstanding are now widely reported as " inadequate " , despite having the same curriculum , the same students , the same leadership team and the same governing body			0
' i am writing in response to your letter to the prime minister seeking approval to launch a public consultation on a voluntary @entity320 for supplementary @entity322 publication of a @entity320 for supplementary schools was an agreed @entity325 commitment and we agreed at the conclusion of the etf ’s work that the @entity329 should be voluntary			1
however , since the publication of the etf report in december there have been serious allegations of extremism in some @entity26 schools and accusations about the inability of local and central government to tackle the problem effectively			1
in this context , i am not convinced that a voluntary code is sufficient and i believe it would be sensible to include the option of developing a mandatory code in your consultation document			0
i understand and share your desire to include a clear and unambiguous definition of extremism and of @entity352 extremism , and indeed i was pleased that we were able to agree the latter in the @entity325 report			0
it is important that having agreed these definitions we now stick to them in the @entity320 to avoid any confusion			0
we know that extremists try to impose specific forms of dress on people and this includes the mandatory veiling of women			0
the consultation document should be clear that nobody should be forced to dress in a particular way			0
we do , however , need to recognise that many moderate @entity36 , as well as people of other religions , believe that covering one ’s hair is a religious requirement and some parents will therefore want their children to do so			0
the text on dress requirements should therefore not be part of the extremism definition but , consistent with the government ’s already - stated position on the burqa , we should state clearly that nobody should be forced to dress in a particular way			0
the allegations relating to schools in @entity26 raise serious questions about the quality of school governance and oversight arrangements in the maintained sector , not just the supplementary schools that would be signatories to this @entity320			1
how did it come to pass , for example , that one of the governors at @entity265 was the chairman of the education committee of the @entity400 ? is it true that @entity49 was warned about these allegations in 2008 ? is it true that the @entity52 was warned in 2010 ? if so , why did nobody act ? i am aware that several investigations are still ongoing and those investigations are yet to conclude			2
but it is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in @entity415 am copying this letter to other members of the @entity419 may mp			0
