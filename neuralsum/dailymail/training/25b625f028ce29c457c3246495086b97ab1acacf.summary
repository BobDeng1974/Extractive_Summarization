@entity1 ’s deputy leader @entity0 finally broke her silence yesterday over her links with a paedophile group			1
miss @entity0 , her mp husband @entity5 and former health secretary @entity6 have been under mounting pressure to explain the connections to the @entity9 while holding key roles in the @entity11			1
the pressure group granted ‘ affiliate ’ status to @entity9 , a notorious group of predatory paedophiles			1
last night miss @entity0 dismissed the revelations as a ‘ politically - motivated smear campaign ’ and offered no apology over the @entity11 ’s extraordinary relationship with the pie			1
in a statement @entity33 said : ‘ they have accused me of being an apologist for child sex abuse , of supporting a vile paedophile organisation , of having a relaxed attitude to paedophilia and of watering down child pornography laws			0
‘ these are horrific allegations and i strongly deny all of them			0
’ the @entity45 discovered that during the 1970s and 80s , the @entity11 described @entity9 – granted formal ‘ affiliate ’ status from 1975 to the mid-eighties – in glowing terms as ‘ a campaigning / counselling group for adults attracted to children ’			1
@entity11 archives showed how the pressure group lobbied @entity55 for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten if the child consented and ‘ understood the nature of the act ’			2
it also called for incest to be legalised in what one mp called a ‘ @entity65 ’s charter ’			0
the @entity11 – now the respected @entity11 – filed a submission to @entity55 claiming that ‘ childhood sexual experiences , willingly engaged in , with an adult , result in no identifiable damage ’			2
miss @entity0 , as @entity11 legal officer , tried to water down child pornography laws			1
@entity11 lawyers acted for @entity9 members who were questioned by police over their disgusting behaviour			2
silence : until now @entity33 has said only that the @entity45 's story is ' untrue and ridiculous ' but refused to answer any questions , as did her husband @entity5 ( pictured ) and @entity1 colleague @entity6 miss @entity6 was general secretary of the @entity11 from 1974 - 83 , miss @entity0 was a newly qualified solicitor when she became its legal officer in 1978 until 1982 , when she entered @entity55			1
mr @entity5 sat on the @entity11 executive committee from 1970 to 1979			0
police are investigating @entity9 as part of @entity84 , launched after the @entity86 affair , with one source saying there is evidence that @entity9 members were abusing children ‘ on an industrial scale ’			0
former health secretary @entity6 was general secretary of the @entity11 from 1974 - 83 the @entity92 is also carrying out a ‘ thorough , independent investigation ’ into shocking claims that the @entity1 government of the 1970s may have helped finance the notorious group			1
ever since december , when @entity45 first investigated the @entity11 ’s links to the paedophile lobby , we have been sending detailed questions to @entity33 , @entity101 and mr @entity5 about their links to @entity9 and whether they now regret supporting such a group			2
miss @entity6 has still to respond but miss @entity0 – after initially dismissing the story as ‘ untrue and ridiculous ’ – and her husband finally issued a statement via the @entity1 yesterday			1
miss @entity0 denied allegations that she supported lowering the age of consent to ten or opposed the law on incest – despite the @entity45 investigation never having made such a claim			2
instead this newspaper stated that the @entity11 , which she joined in 1978 , had controversially lobbied on these issues two years earlier			0
miss @entity0 also denied having opposed the law on incest – again , an allegation the @entity45 did not make			2
this was , nevertheless , the @entity11 ’s position when she became its legal officer			0
miss @entity0 also said that an allegation that she sought in 1978 to water down a proposed ban on child pornography was untrue – although her name is on the @entity11 ’s four - page submission to mps urging that ‘ images of naked children should only be considered pornographic if it could be proven that the subject had suffered ’			1
1978 briefing : the @entity11 legal officer @entity0 wrote this briefing paper on the @entity134 , which sought to ban child pornography			0
she argued that it would lead to an ' increase in censorship ' argument : the second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed recommendations : miss @entity0 's briefing went on that the @entity11 would argue that the @entity146 to protect children should be amended signed : the @entity1 deputy leader 's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered responding to the @entity11 ’s decision to grant ‘ affiliate ’ status to the notorious paedophile group , miss @entity0 said : ‘ @entity45 have tried to make me guilty by way of guilt by association			1
when i was at @entity11 there were around 6,000 members and nearly 1,000 affiliated organisations of which @entity9 was one			0
i was aware that because @entity11 opposed censorship and supported gay rights , paedophiles had sought to exploit that and use @entity11 as a vehicle to make their arguments			0
‘ but by the time i came to work for @entity11 this vile organisation had already been vigorously challenged within the organisation			0
’ she added : ‘ the reason i decided to go to work for @entity11 was because i actively supported the work they had done and in particular the work of their women ’s rights committee on the @entity182 , on the introduction of the @entity184 and for greater protection of victims of domestic violence and against race discrimination			2
’ last night miss @entity0 gave an interview to @entity190 on @entity191 but still repeatedly failed to apologise			1
she refused eight times to accept that the connection with @entity9 was a mistake			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ during my time on the @entity11 executive , i was at the forefront of repeated public condemnations of @entity9 and their despicable views			2
‘ the accusations of the @entity45 are untrue and beneath contempt			0
’ labour leader @entity201 defended his deputy : ‘ @entity0 is somebody of huge decency and integrity			1
i know she has a long and proud record of being on the right side of all of these issues			0
’ last night the @entity45 said : ‘ for ten weeks now the @entity45 has repeatedly asked three leading @entity1 figures to answer questions about the involvement of the @entity11 , a body in which they played leading roles , with a vile paedophile group whose actions are currently being investigated by the police			1
‘ the belated statements today of @entity33 and her husband – full of pedantry and obfuscation – fail to answer the @entity45 ’s central points and deny allegations the @entity45 has not made			0
‘ more pertinently they have failed to utter a word of contrition or sorrow about the @entity11 ’s closeness to the notorious @entity9 , an organisation that validated the activities of a monster like @entity86			1
nor do they utter a word of apology to the victims of @entity9			0
‘ in stark contrast , @entity29 , the director of @entity11 , which took over the @entity11 ’s mantle , has condemned the historic links with @entity9 as a “ source of continuing disgust and horror ”			1
as for smears , it is a newspaper ’s job to ask awkward and controversial questions – questions that in this instance are still awaiting a satisfactory answer			0

@entity1 ’s deputy leader @entity0 finally broke silence
mounting pressure to explain link to @entity9
came while holding key roles in the @entity11
miss @entity0 said revelations were ‘ politically - motivated smear campaign ’
