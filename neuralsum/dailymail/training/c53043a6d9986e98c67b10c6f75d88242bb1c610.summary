international development secretary @entity0 halted more aid going to @entity2 @entity3 yesterday halted £ 21million in aid payments to @entity2 over human rights concerns			1
the surprise move comes only a few weeks after @entity7 called the @entity9 country a ‘ continuing success story ’			0
announcing the policy u-turn , @entity0 said there was ‘ credible and compelling ’ evidence that @entity2 was arming a violent revolt in the neighbouring @entity15			1
her predecessor as international development secretary , @entity18 , had controversially resumed aid payments to @entity2 in september , saying it had ended its support for the so - called @entity22 in the @entity15			1
the commons international development committee said yesterday that mr @entity18 ’s decision was inexplicable , given the weight of evidence suggesting @entity2 president @entity27 has been backing the revolt for months			1
a devastating report by the @entity29 last month detailed @entity2 ’s central role in a conflict that has left a trail of death and destruction in the eastern @entity15 and forced half a million people from their homes			1
miss @entity0 also announced that @entity3 will give an extra £ 18million to the @entity15 to help deal with the humanitarian crisis there			0
the decision to suspend the aid programme is embarrassing for mr @entity7 , who has forged a friendship with @entity27 and invited him to address the @entity44 conference in 2007			1
in october the prime minister mounted a robust defence of mr @entity18 , telling mps : ‘ i am clear @entity2 has been , and continues to be , a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty			1
‘ i am proud of the fact the last government , and this government , have continued to invest in that success			0
’ ' invest in success ' : @entity7 shakes hands with president @entity27 at a meeting in @entity64 , @entity2 , in 2007 @entity3 suspended the last tranche of £ 16million of aid in july when the @entity29 published its interim findings			1
but mr @entity18 , a personal friend of @entity27 , reinstated the payments on his last day as international development secretary			1
justifying the decision he told mr @entity7 in a letter : ‘ @entity72 shows that [ @entity2 ’s ] practical support to the @entity22 has now ended			1
’ mr @entity18 denies acting as a ‘ rogue minister ’ and has stressed @entity2 ’s good record of using aid money to help its people			1
conflict : a @entity15 policeman attempts to stop people entering a base where @entity83 and @entity84 workers were handing out high nutrition cookies north of @entity86 in 2008 but in a report on his decision yesterday @entity47 on the international development committee said : ‘ we are not privy to all the information and advice upon which he made this assessment but , on the basis of the other evidence we received , we do not understand how he reached the conclusion that support for the @entity22 had ceased			1
’ in @entity100 the @entity99 developed a close relationship with @entity27 in an attempt to lose their ‘ nasty party ’ image			0
mr @entity18 , mr @entity7 and dozens of @entity44 @entity47 travelled to the tiny east @entity9 country to carry out voluntary work and display their caring credentials			1
but human rights groups have become increasingly concerned by the actions of the @entity27 regime in recent years – at home and abroad			0
@entity27 , who was re-elected in 2010 with 93 per cent of the vote , has been accused of suppressing political opponents and journalists in @entity2			2
since the start of the year the country has also been accused of masterminding the @entity22 mutiny , which is led by @entity119 , a @entity15 warlord and indicted war criminal			0
@entity2 denies involvement in the conflict			0
@entity27 ’s regime is heavily dependent on foreign aid , which accounts for a third of its annual budget			2
@entity3 is the country ’s biggest foreign donor and this year alone is due to give £ 75million			0
the prime minister ’s spokesman denied the decision to reinstate aid in september was a mistake			0
‘ we stand by the decision that we made to release the last tranche of funding , ’ he added			0
‘ this is our approach to the aid budget			0
we keep decisions under review			0
’ mr @entity7 raised concerns with @entity27 when he spoke to him by telephone a few weeks ago , according to @entity145			2
@entity146 , @entity3 director of @entity147 , said the decision to suspend aid to @entity2 was long overdue			2
he said aid should not be reinstated until @entity2 had shown it was prepared to honour agreements to respect human rights , adding : ‘ for years , these principles have been breached by @entity2 without triggering any response from the @entity155			2
’ @entity157 of the @entity158 ’ @entity156 said : ‘ it ’s appalling that @entity3 taxpayers ’ money has gone directly to a government involved in a proxy war that has brought untold misery to hundreds of thousands of people			0
‘ this announcement leaves a huge question mark over why @entity168 , and specifically @entity18 , reinstated the aid programme			2
’ @entity3 aid to @entity2 is ‘ funding a dictator ’ and worsening the misery of his victims , a former senior aide to the @entity9 state ’s president claimed last night			2
the £ 270million of aid earmarked for the country over the next three years is ‘ sustaining a bad regime ’ , said @entity178 , who was private secretary to president @entity27 until two years ago			1
@entity27 ’s regime is alleged to be funding and arming a bloody rebellion in the neighbouring @entity15 , in a conflict marked by the use of child soldiers and widespread rape and murder .			0

international development @entity0 announces she will not hand the money over next month
her predecessor @entity18 reinstated aid in his last day in the *job* despite @entity29 *warnings*
