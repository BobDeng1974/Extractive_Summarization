by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:29 est , 28 february 2014 for most woman , hair is a part of their feminine identity and shaving it off - no matter how good the motivation - is a big deal			0
for a model , whose entire career revolves around their appearance , the sacrifice of voluntarily stripping themselves of their hair is perhaps even greater			0
but lingerie model @entity20 bravely took a razor to her long brunette hair to raise money for @entity25 awareness charity @entity24 ! , with her new husband looking on			1
@entity20 hopes to raise a total of £ 10,000 for the charity for shaving her head @entity20 , who recently married , works as a lingerie model for @entity31 this is in fact the second time @entity20 has cut off her hair for charity after becoming motivated to fund raise when her own father was affected by cancer the courageous newlywed – who has modelled for @entity31 and is a @entity39 in a @entity42 winner - set the bar high when it comes to fundraising , at £ 10,000 , and so far she has managed to raise just over £ 7,500 with donations still flooding in			1
no stranger to fundraising , @entity20 cut her long hair to a short bob in 2005 after her father was affected by cancer , managing to raise an impressive £ 3,500			1
but before the chop last week , her hair was the longest length it had ever been and she pledged to go one better and shave her head entirely after seeing the work of @entity24 ! at a recent lingerie event			2
before the chop last week , her hair was at its longest length ever @entity20 explains , ‘ it ’s as much about awareness and keeping it in the public eye as it is fundraising , this is happening to women in my demographic , to women who are my friends and it is more important than ever for everyone to sit up and take notice ’			0
she adds , ‘ @entity31 is working with @entity24 ! on several initiatives this year and as an ambassador for the brand i have to support the good work that they will be doing , along with the amazing efforts of @entity24 ! ’ she took the brave step on @entity74 as she wanted to promote the idea of loving yourself and your boobs whilst emphasizing the importance of @entity24 ! ’s message to check your breasts			1
the charity ’s mission is to make sure all breast cancers are diagnosed at the earliest stage possible , making treatments more effective and survival rates higher			0
@entity20 explains : ' it 's as much about awareness and keeping it in the public eye as it is fundraising ' @entity20 poses with her shaven head alongside another two models as part of the @entity24 campaign almost 50,000 women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer in the @entity98 each year and @entity24 ! is determined to educate and remind people to ‘ know theirs boobs ’ in order to catch breast cancer early			1
the charity was set up by @entity104 in 2009 , who at 22 was told she was ‘ too young to get breast cancer ’			2
@entity20 and her husband share an embrace after her hair has been shaved ( left ) , and @entity20 as model ( right ) this meant that her cancer was diagnosed late and could only be treated , never cured			1
@entity104 comments : ‘ we 're thrilled that @entity20 is supporting us with this hugely brave endeavour ! the funds she has pledged to raise us will make a huge difference to @entity24 ! and the vital work we do			2
' the added great support from @entity31 has ensured that her brilliant idea and our message is heard by even more people			0
( and she really did have lovely hair ! ) ’ the hair she had chopped off will go to @entity125 which is a charity that provides real hair wigs for childrenwho have lost their hair to cancer .			0
