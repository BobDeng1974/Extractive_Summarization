“ the procedure involves making a very tiny incision in the clear covering of the eye , or skin of the eye , ' dr. @entity9 explained			1
' the platinum is then inserted			2
i do n’t have to suture it up because it ’s so small and it just closes up after three days			0
' using forceps he positioned the tiny flat stud into position on ms @entity29 's eye membrane			2
she wanted it set pointing diagonally			0

the doctor holds his patient 's eyes open with forceps the doctor makes a tiny incision and divides the pocket between the sclera and the white of the eye before straightening the heart with forceps though it may sound scary , dr @entity9 insists the procedure , which was invented by a @entity87 eye surgeon and introduced in 2004 , is actually pretty safe			1
' it 's a very thin piece of platinum that 's designed for insertion on the top of the eye , it 's not in the eye so there 's no risk of blindness or anything at all , ' he says			2
' she could have a little bit of local bleeding			1
that could go away in a couple days or couple weeks			0
she could have an infection but we 'll prevent that with antibiotics			1
' but the jewelry has not been @entity107 approved and the @entity6 is warning consumers about the dangers			1

' it urges consumers to ' avoid placing in the eye any foreign body or material that is not approved by the @entity107			2
' @entity131 , @entity132 , a comprehensive ophthalmologist from @entity133 , @entity134 previously warned : ' my concern would be that it might cause foreign body granuloma or scar tissue			0
' the implant could also allow bacteria to get beneath the conjunctiva causing a serious vision - threatening infection or possibly erode the sclera , the white part of the eye			2
