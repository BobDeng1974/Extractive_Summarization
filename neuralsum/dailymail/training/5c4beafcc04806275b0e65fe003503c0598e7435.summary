by @entity0 it looks like something from another era - and in many ways it is			0
but this overgrown telephone box , covered both inside and out by ivy , is still fully functioning in @entity8 , @entity9			1
however , @entity10 are set to decommission the telephone box because it has only been used four times in the last year			1
it is not known whether its lack of use is down to the increasing popularity of mobile phones ... or whether people are n't even able to see it 's there ! ring ring the changes : the public can just about gain access to the telephone box but it will soon be out of use hidden from view : despite its shabby state , the telephone is actually in full working order it has become so overgrown with trees , shrubs and ivy from a nearby hedge that it is hard to tell it is there at all in a sign of our times when more people than ever are using mobile phones			1
by march this year , @entity43 said 92 per cent of the @entity45 's adult population had a mobile phone - more than 46 million people			1
in 2006 it was pictured in a similar state and now six years later it will be decommissioned because it underused , somewhat unsurprisingly			0
a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ this is a little used payphone , which is due to be removed in the next few months			0
‘ only four calls have been made from this payphone in the past year			2
it 's for @entity56 : both the inside and the outside of the neglected telephone box has been overcome by plantlife how it should look : this telephone box on the island of @entity64 , in the @entity65 , has been well looked after despite it remote location ‘ there have been no complaints from the public but we will of course tidy up the kiosk now we are aware of the problem			0
’ the iconic red telephone boxes were once a familiar sight on the streets of the @entity45 , painted red to make them easily identifiable to the public			2
despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years , red boxes can still be seen in many places and in current or former @entity45 colonies around the world			2
some kiosks have even been sold off and converted to be used as shower cubicles in private homes			0
in @entity94 upon @entity93 a number of old @entity92 boxes have been utilised to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes			0
in 2009 a @entity92 in the village of @entity99 in @entity9 was converted into a library or book exchange replacing the services of the mobile library which no longer visits the village .			1

phone in @entity8 , @entity9 , has only been used four times in the last year
more than 46 million adults in the @entity45 have a mobile phone : 92 per cent
