by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 7 october 2013 they go to drink cheap beer and have a good time but a new @entity5 documentary has revealed men could come home with more than they bargained for after a stag party in @entity11			1
in @entity15 , @entity13 and @entity11 , which airs on @entity14 this evening , @entity12 visits the @entity17 capital which has become a ' mecca ' for men on the cusp of married life			1
it 's not a surprise to learn they are lured by the cut price alcohol and the prevalence of strip clubs - where they can get a lap dance for £ 35 and pay for extras			2
eye - opener : @entity12 visited @entity11 to discover what really happens on a man 's ' last night of freedom ' let loose : @entity12 found many @entity36 men like this group are just after some harmless fun but others get into trouble when they drink too much but she also wanted to find out ' what life is really like for the thousands of girls paid to entertain the stags and the authorities trying to keep the stags out of trouble '			1
plus she ' gets the low down from those who clean up after them , tracks down the criminals who prey on them and find out what really goes on on a man 's last night of freedom			2
' after what she learnt speaking to sex workers , @entity12 said many brides - to - be may want to put their foot down if their fiance suggests going to @entity11 for their stag do			1
making money : when strippers met the presenter they said they did n't feel exploited prostitution is legal in the city but running a brothel is not			2
however , @entity12 discovered many establishments get around this by thinly disguised them as strip clubs and massage parlours			2
one sex worker told @entity12 that in her experience , five out of ten men on stag do will sleep with a prostitute - and one of the five will ' always ' be the stag			1
but what really alarmed @entity12 was the number who demand unprotected sex despite the risk of catching an @entity86 ' if the girl tell him she is @entity89 positive , he still wants sex without condom			1
it 's like bungee jumping , it 's a thrill , will i or wo n't i catch it ' one prostitute said a third of her clients ask for unprotected sex - and will offer to pay extra for it			1
to support the sex workers and ensure they are safer , @entity101 set up the @entity104 - in @entity11			1
she visits prositiutes in an amulance to test them for @entity89 and other stds			0
she said ' a lot ' of men will try to convince a woman to have sex without a condom			1
' if the girl tell him she is @entity89 positive , he still wants sex without condom			1
it 's like bungee jumping , it 's a thrill , will i or wo n't i catch it , ' she said			1
in danger : @entity12 was shown footage of one drunk who climbed a statute in @entity129 and then fell off - resulting in a serious injury @entity12 said : ' i 'd be devastated if my boyfriend came to @entity11 with the boys and got carried away and had unprotected sex with a prostitute and then had sex with me and gave me an std. it 's not a joke			1
' but it 's not just through sexual indulgence that men are putting themselves at risk when partying in @entity11			1
the copious amounts of alcohol they drink inevitably leads to trouble			0
@entity12 visited the police who monitor the city and regularly encounter men falling over and injurying themselves after having one too many			1
they showed her footage of one drunken man who had climbed a 15m high statue in @entity129 and then fell off - resulting in a serious injury			0
' the locals hate seeing people peeing , puking and being undressed on the street			0
but they do spend money and the economy needs it ' their inebriated state also makes them easy targets for thieves			0
convicted pickpockets admitted to @entity12 that they could make thousands of pounds a night by taking wallets from the back pockets of oblivious tourists			0
some prostitutes also admitted that they would gain extra payment by stealling from their clients			0
other women stole by offering to have sex , then drugging men and taking their money			1
some stags admitted to @entity12 that they felt uncomfortable with the pressure to take drugs whilst in the city			0
and those who succumbed might not even get drugs at all			0
con artists fooled tourists to part with their cash by selling them ' drugs ' which could actually be pine cones			0
the police said they are often powerless to act because men are too embarrassed to report such crimes , or are too drunk to realise they have been the victim of a theft or con before it 's too late - so there 's no proof			2
@entity12 found the drinking culture of @entity195 abroad can also cause havoc for the locals			0
one hotel said they will make stag parties leave a deposit because the rooms are often wrecked - usually by groups of @entity36 men			1
good for the economy : the average stag spends £ 500 while in @entity11 the manageress explained : ' about three weeks ago we had a @entity36 stag group that got so pissed they kicked the door and wrecked the whole frame			2
@entity36 stags are the worst			0
' but she added that many locals simply put up with it because they know it 's good for business - on average each stag can spend £ 500 during their time in @entity11			2
' they know they ( the stags ) bring money and tourism is important			0
but on the other hand they hate seeing people peeing and puking and being undressed on the street			0
but they do spend money and the economy needs it , ' the hotel manager said			0
a stripper revealed the ' worse part about the job is when a group is really drunk and does n't know how to behave '			0
but @entity12 said many of the strippers do n't feel explioted because ' they say they have the upper hand , they are earning five times more than they would doing a regular job			0
' after her eye - opening weekend , @entity12 admitted men should be careful when letting lose on their stag dos			1
' some are having harmless fun but there 's another side that i massively underestimated - the amount of brothels and prosititutes , the pick pocketing and the drugs , ' she said			0
sex , drugs and @entity11 : @entity251 is on @entity14 at 9pm this evening or ctach up on @entity252			2
