families will be paying almost £ 300 a year in green energy taxes by 2020			1
the levy will more than double until a quarter of every pound spent on electricity goes on wind , solar , nuclear or home insulation schemes			0
energy secretary @entity9 insisted last night that households will be better off thanks to the benefits of electricity - saving initiatives			1
but families will be able to claw the money back only if they buy more efficient domestic appliances and boilers			1
the average power bill is now £ 1,267 – with £ 112 of that going on green taxes , including an £ 18 wind farm subsidy			1
by 2020 , green taxes will have risen by more than 150 per cent , ensuring each family contributes £ 286 , according to the @entity24			1
it reckons that by then households will be saving £ 452 a year by taking up schemes to lower energy use and by switching to more efficient kettles , fridges and @entity31			1
the ministry also hopes smart meters , which track energy consumption , will alter consumer behaviour and lower consumption			0
but @entity37 , of the charity @entity38 , said : ‘ @entity24 is clearly embarrassed by the terrifying costs of its ever - growing range of green policies , and is covering up with a whitewash of wildly optimistic assumptions about energy efficiency			1
increase : according to the @entity24 , green taxes will have risen by more than 150 per cent by 2020 , funding wind energy and other renewable schemes savings : the @entity24 reckons that by 2020 households will be saving £ 452 a year by taking up schemes to lower energy use , such as solar panels , and using more efficient goods ‘ if electricity prices increase by a third , as @entity24 admits they will , it is vanishingly unlikely that better dishwashers , kettles , and fridges , even assuming households can afford them , can cancel out the increases and deliver lower bills			1
’ mr @entity9 said his projected savings would mean that households would end up paying £ 166 less than if the green policies had not been introduced in the first place			1
‘ global gas price hikes are squeezing households , ’ he added			0
‘ we are doing all we can to offset these global energy price rises and , while we have more to do , this new study shows that our policies are putting a cushion between global prices and the bills we all pay			2
claims : energy secretary @entity9 said his projected savings would mean that households would end up paying £ 166 less than if the green policies had not been introduced in the first place ‘ the analysis shows our strategy of shifting to alternatives like renewables , and of being smarter with how we use energy , is helping those that need it most save money on their bills			1
‘ the poorest who take advantage of the help that is available through the initiatives we have on offer stand to make the highest savings , from the warm home discount to our new regulation on energy firms to force them to improve the energy efficiency of fuel poor households			2
’ @entity24 claims ‘ the large majority of households ’ will benefit and even those that do not add insulation or take advantage of energy rebates will be £ 15 better off			1
@entity110 , @entity111 ’s energy spokesman , said last night : ‘ the government ’s underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families ’ energy bills is shameful			1
‘ at a time when hard - pressed families and pensioners are seeing their incomes squeezed , only this out - of - touch @entity113 could expect people to fork out thousands of pounds on new tvs , fridge freezers and washing machines just to save a few pounds every few months on their energy bill			2
’ @entity24 admitted green policies had added £ 22 to household bills over the past two years			1
household energy consumption has fallen since 2005 , with gas usage dropping by a fifth and electricity demand down by 11 per cent			2
the drop is partly attributed to energy efficiency measures , but is also a result of belt - tightening , both of which the government expects to continue			2
by 2020 , @entity24 estimates that householders will have replaced 12million boilers with more efficient models			2
criticism : @entity37 , of the charity @entity38 , said : ' @entity24 is clearly embarrassed by the terrifying costs of its ever - growing range of green policies ' which ? executive director @entity147 said : ‘ the government must ensure that the savings to consumers they have estimated will flow from their energy policies , become a reality			1
that will require more transparency and scrutiny of their plans and more practical help for people to make their homes energy efficient			0
shameful : @entity110 , @entity111 's energy spokesman , said : ' the government 's underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families ' energy bills is shameful ' ‘ effective competition in both the wholesale and retail energy markets will also help keep prices in check , but the government ’s plans for reform do n’t yet go far enough to give people confidence that the price they are paying for their energy is a fair one			2
’ under @entity184 climate change targets , around a third of our electricity will have to be generated by renewable energy sources by 2020			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ the analysis underlines the importance of pressing ahead with the range of steps we ’re taking to decarbonise and insulate our economy from excessive reliance on imported gas			0
’ meanwhile , green taxes on business will double , the @entity196 admitted last night			2
total green taxes – including only those mainly designed to change behaviour – will rise from £ 2.5billion to £ 5.6billion by the time of the 2015 election			1
they are then forecast to carry on rising to £ 5.9billion by 2017/8			0
the figures released to @entity204 include the cost of the climate change levy , the aggregates levy , the landfill tax and the @entity210 ’s environmental trading scheme			0
they also include the new carbon price floor – a price per ton of carbon emitted			0
analysts warn that because it only applies in the @entity217 it will force energy intensive firms to move abroad			0
the combined cost of the measure and the climate change levy is due to rocket from £ 600million this year to £ 2.4billion in 2015/6			2
increase : total green taxes - including only those mainly designed to change behaviour - will rise from £ 2.5billion to £ 5.6billion by the time of the 2015 election but the figures do not include other ‘ revenue raising ’ measures , which are sometimes credited with having a ‘ green ’ effect , such as fuel duty			1
the @entity196 said green taxes would rise as a proportion of total taxation from 0.5 per cent to 0.8 per cent			1
economic secretary @entity235 said the @entity236 was ‘ on track ’ to meet a commitment to increase the proportion of revenue from green taxes			1
energy price tariffs are in a constant @entity243 with suppliers constantly battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			0
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
if you have never switched suppliers , or have n't switched for an extended period of time , then now is the time to do it			0
the cheapest rates are usually offered via online tariffs , so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
and , suppliers tend to charge more for electricity to those customers who live in their ' home ' region - the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly before energy deregulation			0
so switching away will almost always save you money			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

energy secretary insisted households will be better off due to initiatives
but families will only benefit if they buy more efficient domestic appliances
average bill is now £ 1,267 with £ 112 of that amount going on green taxes
by 2020 green taxes will have risen by over 150 per cent - £ 286 per family
@entity24 reckons households will be saving £ 452 a year then due to schemes
charity said government ' embarrassed by terrifying cost of green policies '
claimed it is ' covering up ' with a ' whitewash of wildly optimistic assumptions '
