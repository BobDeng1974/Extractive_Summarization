@entity1 , it 's time to sink or swim			1
do n't just be another teenage prodigy who fell by the wayside			0
that 's what those around the forward should be telling him			0
@entity1 must take his chance at @entity11 or his @entity13 career will be over @entity14 has struggled to adapt to life at @entity13 after moving for £ 15m in january 2013 from being one of the most sought after young players in @entity18 , @entity14 has fallen off the radar			1
sir @entity21 's final - ever signing has n't lived up to his billing			1
of course - he still has time on his side			2
he arrived at @entity24 in january 2013 as the premier young talent in @entity27 football			1
what @entity13 found , however , was a player who was n't even ready to train with @entity13 's expensively - assembled squad on a daily basis			1
those in and around @entity33 during the first few months of his @entity13 career would speak of @entity14 's struggles with the intensity of training sessions			1
the fear with elite young players is that if they leave their nest too early in search of more glamourous surroundings , their development can be affected			0
that certainly seems the case with @entity14			0
did he leave @entity11 too early ? in hindsight , yes			0
@entity14 in action for the @entity51 under 21 side against @entity52 in october 2013 having helped the @entity11 to top - flight promotion under @entity54 , the benefits of playing regularly in the @entity56 would have been invaluable			1
but by the time time @entity59 ' penalty booked @entity11 's return to the big - time , @entity14 's move north was already completed			1
there was no turning back			0
except that @entity14 has been forced to go back			0
with no place in @entity66 's plans at @entity13 , the winger has found himself back at @entity67 on loan until the end of the season			1
there were early signs of that old @entity14 sparkle , scoring on his second debut for the club in a 3 - 3 draw at @entity77			2
@entity14 reacts to the crowds with a thumbs up as he is taunted during @entity11 's @entity81 win at @entity82 however , he has n't netted since			1
having worked so hard to bring him back to @entity67 , the man who first discovered @entity14 , manager @entity85 , benched the forward for the final two matches of his reign			0
@entity14 's end product , or rather a lack of , was a major concern for @entity85 and his coaching team			2
getting into good positions , the forward would often over-hit crosses , try one too many tricks or simply chose the wrong option			0
it 's key to remember , of course , that those blistering @entity100 performances that made him the talk of @entity51 's scouting network were in the @entity104			0
since stepping up to the biggest league of all , he has struggled to make an impact			0
the forward celebrates scoring his second goal during @entity11 's @entity104 play - off win at @entity111 but now , under new palace manager @entity113 , there is renewed hope for @entity14			1
in @entity113 , the 22 - year - old knows he has a manager who believes in him , who wants to work with him			2
the manager tried to sign @entity14 during his time at @entity77 , recognising his talent as a potential match - winner			1
' i really like him , i have always liked him , i enquired about him when i was @entity77 manager a couple of time and could not get him , ' admitted @entity113 following saturday 's win over @entity126			1
' i would n’t say that he has been lost			0
when you go to @entity13 it is very , very difficult			0
@entity14 came off the bench for @entity11 against @entity126 at the weekend and is liked by @entity113 ' he has come out on loan and perhaps it has not gone as well as he would have liked			1
you would expect that a little bit			0
he needs to get that confidence			0
' having started @entity113 's first game in charge - the comfortable 4 - 0 @entity81 third round win over @entity136 - @entity135 was back on the bench against @entity126			1
but in his 17 - minute cameo , @entity14 provided tangible evidence that the magic in his speedy feet remains			2
he was excellent , running at defenders with the pace , power and trickery that forced @entity21 to fork out £ 15million for him			2
@entity14 leaves the field following a championship match between @entity11 and @entity150 in 2013 ' his performance against @entity126 will do him no harm and we need to build on that cameo , ' said @entity113			1
' if he plays like that for 90 minutes he will get in every week			0
he has done himself no harm			0
' there was a time when @entity11 fans would chant : ' he 's just too good for you '			2
well , @entity162 , it 's time to prove it .			2

@entity1 was sir @entity21 's last - ever @entity13 signing
@entity14 move from @entity11 to @entity13 for £ 15m in january 2013
but **striker** has struggled atclub and @entity66 does not fancy him
it is time for @entity14 to prove his worth at @entity11 or risk *wasting* his talent
palace boss @entity113 rates @entity14 and **striker** must repay that faith
