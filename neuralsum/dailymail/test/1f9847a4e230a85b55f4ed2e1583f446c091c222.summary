sweet life : @entity1 of @entity2 the @entity3 has created a buzz with the launch of her own honey , produced in late spring by the bees in her @entity9 garden			1
just 250 jars are being produced , at £ 20 each , with all proceeds going to charity			1
but @entity14 ’s venture reflects a rocketing demand for gourmet honey			1
sales of high - end versions are up by 45 per cent at @entity19 since last year			0
does luxury honey really taste different enough from ordinary varieties to justify its price tag , though ? and how does @entity14 ’s honey fare against some of its exclusive rivals — including her husband ’s @entity28 brand ? we tested the best - selling gourmet honeys to find out ... duchess of @entity33 £ 20 for 227g , @entity34 promise : the @entity3 ’s late - spring honey is made from ‘ delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile ’ and billed as ‘ the ideal accompaniment to ice cream on hot summer days , or for sweetening tea ’			1
all proceeds go to the @entity45 charity , of which the @entity3 is patron			1
verdict : this tastefully packaged little jar , decorated with a pretty drawing of a pink flower and bee , has a handwritten number on the back			0
it contains a clear , golden , liquid honey , and when i open the jar a delicate smell of flowers greets my nostrils			1
when you ooze it over buttered bread , it ’s impossible to stop eating			0
delicate , delicious and the perfect gift for any honey - lover			1
5/5 @entity65 winner : @entity14 ’s honey is made from ‘ delicately perfumed nectar with subtle hints of chamomile ' duchy originals @entity72 @entity71 £ 5.10 for 227g , @entity73 promise : heathers growing on the @entity75 in @entity76 produce the nectar for this honey			1
beekeepers prize heather honey for its unique taste , and this is a combination of two types of heather , @entity83 and @entity84			1
verdict : open the jar and just smell the heather aroma before you taste this golden delight			1
@entity14 may have set the bar high but prince @entity91 ’s answer is also rather beautiful and rare			0
it has a thick , velvety , sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste			1
3/5 duchy originals @entity72 @entity71 has a thick , velvety , sugary texture and a strong but fabulous taste @entity99 £ 14.95 for 325g , wedderspoon.co.uk promise : @entity101 trees grow on high land in @entity103			1
they flower sporadically , so the nectar is extremely rare			0
the honey is kept at a low temperature — the same as that of a beehive — to preserve natural enzymes , antioxidants , vitamins and minerals			1
verdict : did you ever think honey could taste like a christmas tree ? take one gulp of this delicious amber nectar and , seconds later , a subtle taste of pines will dance on your tongue			1
this creamy , firm - set honey scooped a place in the top 50 products ( out of 10,000 ) in the ‘ food @entity126 ’ , the @entity128			1
now i ’ve tried it , that comes as no surprise			0
4/5 @entity133 scooped a place in the top 50 products in the ‘ food oscars ’ @entity136 £ 29.95 for 113g , tregothnan.co.uk promise : although manuka is generally expensive , this is a more normal - tasting version and @entity140 ’s costliest home - grown honey			1
most manuka plants grow in @entity103 but bushes have been growing , hidden behind a garden wall , on the @entity145 estate in @entity2 since 1880			1
bees on the estate feast on these plants as well as on flowers in the deer park and gardens and produce honey in state - of - the - art , six - foot hives , which cost £ 5,000 each			1
there is only a limited supply made , hence the hefty price tag			1
verdict : this honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars , so every teaspoon is expensive			1
yet it sells out fast each year and has a cult following among honey fans			1
the jar opens to reveal a light , cream - coloured honey with an almost - white crust			1
dip your spoon in to discover solid , set honey which tastes like crystallised sugar			2
i used a small teaspoon on each dessert for a dinner party and my guests raved about it			0
a treat for anyone with a sweet tooth			0
4/5 @entity136 honey is so rare it is sold in very small jars , so every spoonful is pricey vasilissa @entity185 honey with @entity186 £ 39.99 for 250g , selfridges.co.uk promise : produced by hand on a small family farm on the island of @entity191 , this honey is trickled with 24 - carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling			1
the small gold flakes are added to honey made from thyme blossom , infusing it with the flavour of the herb			1
@entity185 honey is said to be among the best in the world , thanks to the aroma of mountain herbs and flowers , long sunny days and ancient , organic production methods			2
verdict : the shimmering flecks make this an indulgent gift for any honey - lover			2
it looks so good , i do n’t know whether to open the jar or use it as a paperweight			0
the beautiful white packaging makes it feel extra-special , and when i unscrew the lid the deep aroma is like a glorious perfume			0
@entity223 is a smooth , dark - gold honey that tastes like treacle			2
the experts who hand - make it say the flavour changes subtly each year ; they can recognise each one like wine experts identifying a vintage			0
tasting this , i can see why they call honey the food of the gods			2
5/5 vasilissa @entity185 honey is trickled with 24 - carat edible gold to make it the ultimate in food bling @entity239 @entity235 £ 7.95 for 500g , souschef.co.uk promise : this is made by a small producer in northern @entity242 , still using the same traditional methods after five generations			1
the nectar comes from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the @entity249 mountains , and the resulting herb - infused honey has a high iron content			2
it is said to be particularly good for the digestion , and as an aid to relaxation			0
verdict : this is the honey equivalent of a soft - boiled egg			2
dip your spoon in for oozing , runny honey in the middle , but enjoy the crunch of the pale , crystallised honey at the sides			2
it ’s very mild — there is no strong aroma and the rosemary flavour is so delicate that you notice it only after several mouthfuls			0
it does gives a rather surprising aftertaste , though			0
this is my daughter @entity274 ’s favourite honey — she describes it as the best of both worlds , for its double consistency			2
4/5 @entity282 uses nectar from rosemary bushes that grow at the foot of the @entity249 mountains @entity287 £ 21 for 908g , @entity34 promise : @entity289 honey with a gentle fruity flavour			1
the delicate honeycomb adds a crumbly texture			0
gathered by bees from the wildflowers of meadows and hedgerows in @entity297			2
verdict : this looks impressive — a huge glass jar with golden , syrupy honey and a huge , striking honeycomb in the middle , sparkling like a jewel			2
the @entity34 label adds to the impression of real quality			0
what a disappointment , then , to bite into the honeycomb and find that it tastes of earwax			0
the chewy mass is like old gum			0
i spit it out — as does my honey - loving son @entity315 , who says it tastes no different from the supermarket own - brand honey we usually buy			2
proof that paying more does n’t always guarantee a pot of gold			0
1/5 @entity321 £ 19.99 for 227g , selfridges.co.uk promise : the starflower is another name for the borage plant ( which sounds much less exotic )			2
but this herbal flower is rich in calcium , vitamin c and potassium			0
it is used to strengthen adrenal functions , and its oils are prescribed to treat skin diseases			0
this light and delicate honey comes from @entity334 , and includes heather honeycomb with a hint of herb flavour			2
verdict : you ca n’t see the chunky honeycomb until you open the lid , because the pale honey that surrounds it is n’t transparent			0
i ’ve never liked the texture of honeycomb myself , but bite into this and breakfast will never be the same again			0
it crumbles delightfully in the mouth , while the light honey ( not quite runny but not totally set ) unleashes a real taste of the countryside			1
the jar , with its bright yellow ribbon and artisan label , gives this a real sense of occasion			0
4/5 @entity321 crumbles delightfully in the mouth , while the light honey unleashes a real taste of the countryside @entity362 £ 6.95 for 500g , souschef.co.uk promise : a dark , runny honey with a rich , nutty taste and smoky aromas			1
this is formed from the flowers of the chestnut tree , so it has a slightly bitter , savoury aftertaste			0
a favourite among chefs , who claim that it adds instant depth to dishes			0
verdict : after tasting so many sweet honeys , this one came as a total shock			0
a dark brown , treacle - tasting honey , it has a wonderful , unmistakable chestnut aroma			0
my children did n’t like it at all , but i teamed it with cheese and biscuits to serve after a dinner party and the combination was a winner			0
perfect if you want something completely different			0
3/5 @entity362 is a dark , runny honey with a rich , nutty taste and smoky aromas			1
