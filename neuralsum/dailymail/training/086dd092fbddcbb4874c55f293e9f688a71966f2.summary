on the rise : according to a new report from the @entity6 , female sterilization or tube - tying may soon overtake the @entity13 as women 's preferred form of birth control sterilization involves surgically or non-surgically blocking or cutting a woman 's fallopian tubes , making her permanently unable to get pregnant			1

another option is to put tiny inserts into the tubes , causing tissue to grow around them and block the tubes			0
the brand name for this type of sterilization is @entity41			2
since it has a nearly 100per cent success rate , it 's an especially popular option among middle - aged women who have already had as many children as they want			2

' and they still have the capacity to get pregnant until they are 50 years old			0
' unlike methods of birth control that require maintenance , like condoms or the @entity13 , sterilization is seen as the more reliable way to ensure that women do not fall pregnant ever again			1
women are also aware that the health risks of pregnancy increase after the age of 30 , causing them to seek out a permanent solution			2
