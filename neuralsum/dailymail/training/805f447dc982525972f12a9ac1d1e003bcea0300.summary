there has been a lot of talk , as ever , about @entity3 in a @entity4 year but the words of two former @entity7 midfielders spoke volumes last summer			1
when @entity3 's long - term credentials for both @entity11 and @entity7 were questioned , @entity9 simply said : ‘ if you think @entity3 ’s gone , then you are sadly mistaken			1
' @entity15 , after wondering aloud whether @entity3 's glory days were behind him , then gazed into his crystal ball : ' i do n't think @entity3 will be able to play centre forward until he 's 34 or 35			1
but he could play centre midfield , possibly , into his mid-thirties			1
@entity3 strikes to score his second goal in @entity23 's fixture against @entity24 at @entity25 in his new role @entity3 has been likened to former @entity7 central midfielder @entity15 in @entity7 's last three games @entity3 has now been directly involved in five of their seven goals , scoring three			1
the 29 - year - old celebrates his opener against @entity24 at @entity25 with @entity7 striker @entity31 ' he 's got all the ability to take over my old position at @entity7			1
' now , under @entity36 , @entity15 ' premonition is coming into fruition			0
he has started the last three games as a central midfielder and has been directly involved in five of @entity7 's seven goals , scoring three			1
@entity3 is still @entity7 's most important player , still the soul and spirit of his team			1
he has now been dining at the top table of @entity11 football for some 14 years but he still seems to work harder , cover more ground and expend more energy than those around him			0
if truth be told , not everybody at @entity25 felt entirely comfortable with the prospect of @entity3 wearing the captain 's armband			1
some felt he was granted preferential treatment by @entity57 and privately licked their lips with glee after the appointment of @entity36 , presuming the @entity62 would favour @entity63			0
@entity3 's ability was questioned during the @entity4 last summer , but appears to be enjoying his new role @entity3 is now well accustomed to the questions that surround his longevity as an elite footballer			2
and he continues to embarass those who ask them			0
for some , @entity3 is still not quite the player we wanted him to be			2
nobody stirs the debate quite like him			0
he could drop a crisp packet on the floor and be blamed for climate change			0
the perception of @entity3 veers from one extreme to another with unreasonable frequency			2
we lament his failure to reach the @entity88 / @entity87 stratosphere when we should recognise his consistent excellence for club and country			0
it is now nine @entity94 goals for the season and he remains the one player that appears most eminently capable of lifting this @entity7 team when he feels the need			1
just like @entity15 , @entity3 's @entity94 record for @entity7 is phenomenally impressive as a captain , @entity3 continues to mature			1
privately , he was disappointed that he let his team - mates down with a wild hack on @entity104 in october , bringing a red card and a three match ban			0
that one instance , however , must be considered in the context of a player that has received only three yellow cards in his last 41 appearances for club and country			0
his contribution to the @entity7 cause is unquestionable			2
@entity3 has now scored or assisted 97 goals in his last 101 @entity94 games at @entity25 , scoring 68 and creating 29			1
it is a remarkable statistic and almost makes you question whether @entity3 's considerable qualities have been underestimated in recent times			2
if his future is to lie in central midfield , it will bring a long over-due goal threat			0
a decade has passed since @entity7 last possessed a central midfield player that scored more than 10 goals in a single @entity94 season			1
it was @entity15 , in the 2004 - 05 campaign			0
@entity3 's passing accuracy against @entity24 on friday was reminiscent of former @entity134 midfielder @entity15 since hanging up his boots after his retirement @entity15 has taken up a position as a television pundit against @entity24 on @entity23 , @entity3 showcased the technique and vision that @entity36 so clearly appreciates , recording a 90.2 per cent passing accuracy but even more impressive is the 85.7 per cent success in his opponents ' half , underlining the damage he can do in the final third with that majestic chipped pass to create @entity63 's goal			1
it was a ball that @entity15 would have been proud to play			0
this was @entity3 at his lung - busting , committed best but allaying all that dedication with his technical poise			2
for a long time , many have asked whether his endurance would be impaired by his powerful physique			0
@entity36 provided an emphatic answer to that after yesterday 's performance : ' he has the lung capacity to run 90 minutes as a midfielder			0
' to quote @entity9 once more : ‘ if you think @entity3 ’s gone , then you are sadly mistaken			2

@entity3 has started the last three league games in centre midfield
in this time he has been directly involved in five of @entity7 's seven goals
the @entity169 star recorded a 90.2 *%* passing accuracy against @entity24
@entity3 has now scored or assisted 97 goals in his last 101 @entity94 games at @entity25 , scoring 68 and creating 29
