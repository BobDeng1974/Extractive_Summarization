sending a package abroad ? here 's a word of advice : pick your airline carefully			0
a hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by an air freight handler at @entity9 in @entity10 recently			1
the worker energetically ditches a trolley full of boxes in the general vicinity of a conveyer belt , which is supposed to transport them inside the airplane			1
but only a few actually hit their target , with most landing on the tarmac with a crash			2
' these blokes do n't give a damn , ' the @entity34 passenger , @entity33 , says on the tape , which he later uploaded to @entity38			1
' what a half - witted idiot			0
more end up on the ground than are going on the conveyer belt			0
' ' do n't put your air freight with @entity30 , ' he adds			1
fragile ? the boxes are chucked aggressively in the direction of the conveyor belt cleaning up : the worker has to handle all the boxes twice because so few of them made the conveyor belt the first time ' he 's going to have to handle them all twice because most of them are on the ground			1
@entity57 knows what 's in there			0
hope it 's not fragile			0
' it 's unclear what is inside the fairly uniform boxes shown on the tape			0
however , @entity33 notes in his @entity38 commentary that on a previous occasion he witnessed @entity68 sewing machines plastered with ' this way up ' and ' fragile , handle with care ' stickers being treated with the same respect			2
quick chat : the worker stops work to answer his cell phone mid air : the packages are thrown sky high and crash onto the tarmac at one point , the handler answers his cell phone , but continues throwing the boxes towards the belt one - handed			1
' this was amazing to watch			0
i think i was the only one noticing what was happening outside the window of the plane , ' @entity33 wrote under the video , which has garnered more than 75,500 views			2
' lesson : pack it well , because it wont be treated well			0
' looking at his handy work : the worker takes a break and views his strike rate all done : finally the trolley is empty , but only a handful of packages made it onto the conveyor belt			1

*footage* shows air freight handlers at @entity9 in @entity10 chucking boxes onto a @entity30 plane
most of the packages *bounce* off the conveyor belt and onto the tarmac , or miss the belt entirely
