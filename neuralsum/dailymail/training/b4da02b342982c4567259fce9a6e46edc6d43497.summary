by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:31 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 3 december 2013 voters want @entity3 to be run by a @entity4 politician who is ‘ all brains and no heart ’ , according to new polling based on the @entity6 which will be seen as a boost for @entity8			1
in a blow for @entity14 ’s emotional pitch to the electorate , fewer people would vote for a @entity16 , who is ‘ all heart and no brains ’			1
the survey of voters in the @entity3 is based on polling which has successfully predicted the outcome of @entity23 presidential elections			0
tin man : voters who prefer a leader who is ' all brains , no heart ' are more likely to back @entity8 's @entity28 scarecrow : @entity14 's emotional pitch to voters is more likely to be viewed as ' all heart , no brains ' experts say voters will base their decision on who to back at the 2015 on whether they prefer someone smart enough to run the country or if their heart is in the right place			1
in the @entity6 , @entity40 is joined on her journey to the @entity42 by a @entity16 , a @entity4 , and a @entity43			0
leading @entity23 pollster @entity44 has been posing the @entity6 question since 2000			1
he asks : ‘ imagine you live in the @entity47 , and the candidates are the @entity4 , who 's all brains and no heart , and the @entity16 , who 's all heart and no brains			2
who would you vote for ? ' amongst all voters , a majority prefer the @entity4 over the @entity16 it is designed to unpick voters ’ reactions to differing leadership styles			2
in the 2000 race for the @entity62 , @entity60 was well ahead of @entity63 in traditional polling , but the @entity4 was neck and neck with the @entity16			2
the result of the election was similarly close			0
now @entity69 has put the question to voters in the @entity3			0
of all those surveyed , 41 per cent say they would prefer to be led by the @entity4 , compared to just 32 per cent who chose the @entity16			1
this suggests voters want someone to take hard - headed decisions , rather than someone whose heart is in the right place			1
the @entity28 will seize on the results as proof their commitment to economic competence is valued by voters more than the warm - hearted concerns about the cost of living expressed by @entity87 ’s @entity14			1
people who said they would back the @entity89 at the next election favour the @entity4 by 60 per cent to 21 per cent , but among @entity87 supports 41 per cent prefer the @entity16 over 32 per cent who said @entity4			1
there are also big differences in gender and region			0
amongst men , 46 per cent back the @entity4 , well ahead of the 27 per cent who chose the @entity98			2
but for women , 37 per cent said @entity100 , one point ahead of @entity4			0
younger voters also support the @entity4 , with only the over- 60s putting the @entity16 ahead			0
tories prefer @entity104 but @entity87 supporters prefer @entity106 , the @entity69 polling revelaed men prefer the @entity4 while women prefer the @entity16 , while only the over- 60s prefer the idea of being run by someone who is ' all heart and no brains ' @entity115 also has large majorities of around 17 points in @entity118 and the @entity119 , but in the @entity121 only one point separates the two choices			1
separate polling by @entity69 shows that just 23 per cent of voters think the @entity28 ' ‘ heart is in the right place ’ and 86 per cent say the party is ‘ very close ’ or ‘ fairly close ’ to the rich			0
the difference in approach by the two political leaders was laid bare today			0
in a worrying sign for the @entity28 , the @entity4 is favoured in @entity118 and the @entity119 , but the gap is much narrower in the @entity121 where there are few @entity89 - held seats mr @entity8 is in @entity136 this week leading a trade delegation which has focussed on securing billsions of pounds of investment in the @entity3			2
but mr @entity14 was on the @entity141 sofa highlighting how women have been hit hard by the consequences of the financial crash which occurred under @entity87			2
he claims those working full - time on average £ 2,500 out of pocket over the last three years			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ this cost - of - living crisis is hitting women particularly hard			1
women have seen their wages on average , if you are working full - time , go down by £ 2,500 in just three years because prices have been rising faster than wages			0

41 **%** prefer to be lead by a @entity4 over 32 **%** who said scarecrow
but women prefer ' all heart , no brains ' while men favour ' brains , no heart '
@entity8 has focused on hard - headed economic competence
@entity14 making more emotional pitch on cost of living
