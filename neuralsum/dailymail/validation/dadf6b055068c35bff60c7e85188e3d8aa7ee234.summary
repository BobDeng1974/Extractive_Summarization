@entity1 manager @entity0 believes his side have finally banished the fear factor which has been holding them back			1
the 3 - 0 win over 10 - man @entity6 thanks to goals from @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 was the @entity1 ' first at @entity11 in the league in 2015			1
it was a crucial one as it lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone and @entity0 believes the basis for the performance was founded in the come - from - behind 2 - 1 @entity20 win over @entity21 on thursday			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 have finally banished the fear factor which has been holding them back @entity8 ( right ) opened the the scoring against @entity6 and was congratulated by @entity25 ' it was a big game for us and sometimes that can bring extra pressure in that you play the occasion rather than the game , ' he said			1
' the perfect preparation was thursday			2
probably thursday was a real turning point in that moment when we managed to take control of the situation			2
the first 20 minutes ( against @entity39 ) was as bad as it can be in terms of suffering because you feel the anxiety and responsibility as a player then all of a sudden we found the way we should perform			0
' the mindset today was n't of a team who had fear of losing at home , some of the play was outstanding but when we had to defend and work hard for each other we did that with total composure			2
' from scoring the first goal we managed the game really well and i thought we defended really composed			0
@entity59 had a big save in the second half but apart from that i thought we protected him very well			0
@entity1 were already 2 - 0 up when @entity63 captain @entity62 was sent off for a lunge at winger @entity25 and @entity0 had no doubts about the straight red card			1
@entity9 , having set up @entity8 for the opener , netted @entity1 's second from the penalty spot ' i have n't seen the replay but i thought it was reckless and high , ' he added			1
' if you look at the reaction of the @entity6 players i do n't think anyone was surprised when they saw the red card			1
' i do n't think it was a turning point or the reason why we won because we were very much in control but it always helps			0
' @entity6 caretaker boss @entity83 's initial thoughts were to agree with @entity0 but he admits he will closely examine all footage over the next day or two before deciding the next course of action			1
' i have looked at it from four or five angles and it is not conclusive , ' he said			0
@entity10 celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3 - 0 ' when it actually happened , from the reaction of the @entity1 players , straight away i thought ' that must be a red '			1
but when i came in and looked at it , it was very difficult to decide			0
' i will look at it again and if it is worthy of a sending off then i will accept it but if it is not i will appeal			0
' there seemed to be more of their players surrounding the situation than our players			0
' with nothing to play for @entity6 are limping towards the end of the season but @entity83 stressed that would not be allowed to happen and there was an immediate dressing room inquest after the game , although he was keen to point out it was not confrontational			1
' a few of the guys had a few composed words after the match , ' he added			0
' i told one or two players not to say anything because usually it is one or two players who come forward - i wanted it to come from other people			2
' the fact people make a point i think is a healthy situation - it ca n't always come from me , i 'm not a dictator			2
' we ca n't go hiding or disappear anywhere			0
i ca n't walk around miserable as sin , i have to do something about it			0
' the guys had a good two - way conversation and we will review it all on tuesday			2
