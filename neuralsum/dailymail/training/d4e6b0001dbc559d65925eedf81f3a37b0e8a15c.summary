an ' unnatural ' coalition government formed on monday between anti-austerity party @entity2 and nationalist @entity3 could prove short - lived , analysts said			1
@entity2 are the first anti-austerity party to govern in @entity5 , but they fell two seats short of a 151 - seat majority in parliament and thus needed an ally			1
@entity2 's 40 - year - old leader @entity10 opted to cooperate with the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , a party just as determined as his own to dump the austerity policies imposed over the past five years in return for a 240 - billion - euro ( Â£ 178billion ) @entity15 - @entity14 bailout			1
the placard , centre , reads in @entity26 : ' this is really a goodnight mrs @entity33 ' referring to the @entity26 chancellor , and the one on the right reads : ' i support @entity2 , @entity25 ' but analysts note that @entity3 - best - known for vitriolic attacks on @entity26 - are unpredictable at best , and governing with them could also disrupt the balance among the various left - wing factions that make up @entity2			1
the radical leftists are already heading for a confrontation with @entity44 's international creditors over their insistence on renegotiating the bailout deal and having most of the country 's enormous debt written off			0
should the coalition falter , @entity44 could be forced into another election , paralysing the still - struggling economy and potentially plunging the eurozone into fresh instability			2
' @entity2 is made up of groups espousing different ideologies and @entity10 will have to seek a compromise inside his party , which is difficult , ' said @entity58 , a professor of political science at @entity60			1
' this is a strange and unnatural alliance , ' he told @entity62 , adding : ' the truth about the government 's cohesion will be revealed when they sit at the negotiating table in @entity5			1
' @entity2 and @entity3 were brought closer in recent years by their common opposition to the @entity15 - @entity14 bailout , which forced sweeping spending cuts on @entity44 and deepened a painful six - year recession			1
coverage of @entity2 's win on the front pages of @entity44 newspapers in @entity76 , @entity22 , @entity44 but they could not be further apart on other key issues such as immigration and civil rights			1
@entity2 want to soften @entity44 's stance on migrants and asylum - seekers , while @entity3 are close to the influential @entity83 and want to take a strong stance against neighbouring @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
' the two movements have nothing else in common ( except the bailout )			0
this is not an auspicious start , ' said @entity94 political scientist @entity93			2
' the government 's cohesion will be tested on a daily basis ... power unites , of course , but i ca n't imagine certain people inside @entity2 will be very happy with this ( alliance ) , ' he added			1
@entity3 leader @entity18 , 49 , is a volatile ex-conservative lawmaker who abandoned the @entity104 in 2012 after it approved the @entity15 - @entity14 bailout , forming his own movement			1
he has often called @entity44 's creditors ' foreign conquerors ' but wants the country to keep the euro			0
' a coalition with @entity3 could raise the risks of a big clash with @entity5 ... @entity3 is often seen as a group with a grudge , ' said @entity117 analyst @entity116			1
@entity18 has termed the previous government a ' dictatorship ' and said officials who signed the loan agreement should be put on trial			0
@entity2 's leader @entity10 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity44 's president @entity125 ( left ) as he is sworn in as @entity44 prime minister at the @entity127 in @entity22 on monday ' we do not consider @entity3 an @entity130 party			1
unless of course it 's pro-european to bow to the demands of ( @entity26 chancellor @entity136 and ( @entity26 finance minister @entity137 , ' @entity131 , a member of @entity2 's political committee , told @entity138			1
' @entity44 should be seen as an equal partner in @entity5 , not as a tenant , ' he said			2
there had been expectations that @entity2 would ally itself with @entity144 , a new @entity145 party that won 17 seats in the election			1
@entity93 , of the @entity94 , argued that @entity3 could be an expendable asset for @entity2 , to be cast aside once negotiations with the rest of @entity5 are over			1
' once the balance ( in @entity5 ) changes they could say ' goodbye ' and seek an alliance with @entity144 ... or hold new elections hoping for a better score , ' he said			1
renewed fears that @entity44 could be forced out of the eurozone if it defaults on its debt repayments saw the euro hit an 11 - year low against the dollar monday , while @entity44 stocks closed down more than three percent			2
the @entity14 extended an olive branch to the new @entity44 government , saying it was prepared to continue its financial support to the country			0
' we stand ready to continue supporting @entity44 , and look forward to discussions with the new government , ' @entity14 managing director @entity167 said in a statement			0
however , @entity173 chief @entity172 warned that @entity44 can not expect any reduction in its huge debt commitments			0
' there is no urgent need for action ' on @entity44 's debt , @entity172 told @entity26 television station @entity180 , adding that a reduction ' is not on the radar '			0
many @entity44 were optimistic that the fortunes of a country mired in deep recession were about to change for the better			0
@entity186 , a @entity2 supporter in @entity22 , said : ' today is a very good day			2
i believe things will go well for our country			0
' but others were sceptical			0
' there are many promises , but at the end there will be nothing			0
they only want power , ' said @entity199 as she walked through the capital 's @entity201 - scene of many demonstrations against austerity			0
in a sign of the mammoth challenge ahead , the @entity15 issued a stern statement that @entity44 will risk its place in the eurozone if it fails to meet its austerity and debt commitments			0
from @entity213 to @entity214 , officials said they were open to talks with the new team in @entity22 , but many signalled its proposals were unrealistic			0
in exchange for the bailout in 2010 , @entity44 was forced to slash public - sector spending , cut wages and pensions and introduce a far - reaching programme of privatisation			0
@entity2 has pledged to reverse many of those measures			2
but chancellor @entity33 of @entity5 paymaster @entity26 made her views clear			2
' in our view it is important for the new government to take action to foster @entity44 's continued economic recovery , ' her spokesman @entity229 said			0
' that also means @entity44 sticking to its previous commitments			0
' anti austerity @entity239 supporters celebrate as leader @entity10 speaks folllowing victory in the election in @entity22 on january 25 sunday 's poll was @entity44 's fourth in five turbulent years , including back - to - back votes in 2012			1
during that time the economy has shrunk by a quarter and unemployment has soared beyond 25 percent			0
@entity2 's victory could inspire other anti-austerity parties in @entity5 , including @entity252 's @entity251 , which has topped several opinion polls and is aiming for an absolute majority in the @entity252 election in november			1
' our victory is also a victory for all @entity5 peoples fighting against austerity that is destroying our common @entity5 future , ' @entity10 told supporters sunday			1
@entity263 finance minister @entity262 said what @entity2 was proposing was ' incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members '			2
however , @entity263 prime minister @entity268 issued a warmer statement late monday , congratulating @entity10 and welcoming his ' intention to tackle corruption and increase tax transparency across @entity44 '			2
other @entity5 countries also said they were prepared to work with the new @entity44 government			2
@entity276 president @entity275 invited @entity10 to @entity277 and @entity252 's conservative prime minister @entity278 said he hoped the victory would lead to a ' stable government '			2
@entity282 saw the @entity44 result as possibly helping its push for greater flexibility in the @entity15 's approach to budgets and broader economic issues , foreign minister @entity281 said			0
@entity289 , the president of the @entity290 , will meet @entity10 in @entity22 on thursday , @entity2 said in a statement , the first visit paid by a foreign dignitary to the new prime minister since his victory			1
in @entity297 , the @entity296 said it hoped to work closely with the new government and would continue ' to support international efforts to foster @entity44 's economic recovery '			0
' there are indications that the economy is poised for renewed growth , but many challenges remain , ' @entity302 spokeswoman @entity301 said .			0
