@entity0 is aiming to turn back the clock and thrill @entity3 fans again after the 36 - year - old returned ' home ' 14 years since he last played for wanderers			1
the veteran @entity6 is back at the club he first joined in 1998 , aiming to experience a late - career renaissance having returned to these shores following short stints with @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			2
@entity0 embarked on an upward trajectory when he left @entity3 in 2000 , enjoying trophy - laden spells at @entity17 and @entity18 , but he has failed to settle since despite playing in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity0 looked delighted to be back at @entity3 when unveiled on tuesday afternoon new @entity3 singing @entity0 watched on from the stands as his new side faced @entity25 @entity0 played for @entity3 's @entity26 against @entity27 last monday before signing a deal yet the forward , who last friday penned a deal with @entity3 until the end of the season , is optimistic he can rekindle some of the old magic now he is back in familiar surroundings at the @entity35			1
' injuries came into play and in certain situations in the latter stages of my career i 've found it difficult at times to settle in at clubs that i 've been to , ' he said			2
' whether it 's been adapting to the style of play , or the surroundings - it just has n't worked out at times			0
' i feel like i 've been here for a couple of years already because it feels like home			0
' now it 's just a matter of me being hard on myself in the next few weeks and being as ready as i can when called upon			0
' @entity0 , who needs international clearance before he can make his debut , is realistic enough to acknowledge he will not be the same player who helped @entity3 reach two play - off campaigns and @entity59 and @entity60 semi-finals during his two - year spell			1
@entity0 during his first spell at @entity3 before he left the club for @entity17 but he does believe that a career which has seen him play under the likes of @entity66 and @entity67 will give him an edge in the second tier			1
' last time i was here i was a young boy with very fresh legs and now in footballing terms i 'm probably an old man , ' he noted			0
' it will be more playing on experience , trying to read situations before anyone else and the mind just has to make sure that the legs and body will follow			0
' @entity0 may not be the only veteran player to join @entity3 's ranks out of the transfer window either , with @entity85 forward @entity84 , also 36 , training with @entity88 's men as wanderers assess whether the free agent is worthy of a similar short - term deal			1
@entity88 's other attacking options lack experience and the duo of @entity0 and @entity84 have 140 international caps between them			2
the @entity97 forward played for wanderers between 1998 and 2000 and was a fans ' favourite ' and about 100 years together as well , ' @entity0 joked			1
' he 's a physical presence and you can still see it ; there 's not much changed in him			0
if he wants to play and if he 's hungry to play then i 'd love for him to be with us			0
' any bit of quality , any bit of experience , any bit of competition within the group is always helpful and whether it 's him or other players , we want to find a healthy competition to get the best out of each other			0
