saved : @entity6 was severely brain damaged in an accident at his father 's place of work and unable to afford the right care for him , his parents wanted to turn off his life support however , after an unnamed local charity heard about the family 's plight , they stepped in to cover the cost of life - saving brain surgery and aftercare for @entity6			1
the 18 - month - old 's parents had taken him to visit his father at work at a courier firm in the @entity40 township in @entity41 in central @entity8 's @entity42 on december 1st last year			2
@entity6 somehow ended up getting trapped in a conveyor belt used to deliver parcels , leaving him horrifically injured and on life support in the local hospital			1
@entity6 was in the hospital in @entity7 for over a month after the accident , and was not able to move or talk			2
he also had difficulty swallowing and breathing after being discharged			0
his parents applied for his life support to be switched off , as they were unable to afford proper care for him , which would lead to him slowly dying in severe pain			2
new beginning : the story of @entity6 's accident and his parents heartbreaking choice attracted international attention and after a charity stepped in to help , he successfully underwent brain surgery in @entity60 accident : @entity6 was involved in an accident while visiting his father at his place of work , a courier delivery firm , when he got stuck on a conveyor belt family care : @entity16 , 33 , feeds her 18 - month - old son in the hospital in @entity60 their request was rejected by the local civil affairs bureau because euthanasia is illegal in @entity8			1
however @entity6 's story attracted international attention and after a charity stepped in to help , he successfully underwent brain surgery at the @entity78 of @entity79 in @entity60 last week			1
dr @entity80 , director of the children hospital 's neurosurgery department , said that the follow - up rehabilitation will need a good deal of time , energy and money , and that they were optimistic the boy would have a chance of recovery , although it was still unclear to what degree			2
he said : ' we ca n't promise how well he can recover			0
the best result would be that he can take care of himself in the future			0
' the boy 's father told @entity99 : ' the thought of euthanasia came about because we could see no solution and could n't bear to see our son suffer every day			2
' he said : ' we knew that many people would condemn us when they realised that we wanted to ask permission for our son to die , and two - months - ago i would have also said it was unthinkable whatever the circumstances			0
a mother 's love : the toddler 's parents saw no other way out when they asked for doctor 's to let him die no choice : guangqun and her husband 's request was rejected because euthanasia is illegal in @entity8 @entity16 is seen preparing a medication for @entity6 who now has a chance to recover from the accident ' but the counterpoint as a parent is whether it 's just as unthinkable to see so much suffering continue with someone you love			1
' our son was lying in intensive care and the doctor said that because of the massive brain damage he suffered , there was no chance of a proper recovery			1
when he finally woke up he could n't even feed himself , and all he can do is breathe unaided			0
' we could not even afford the drips to feed him after the money ran out , and are having to inject milk directly into his stomach to keep him alive			0
' they said that they had run up massive debts and that after taking the boy home it was a living nightmare watching their child struggling for every breath			0
@entity15 said earlier : ' his eyes were rolling around inside his head because of the effort of breathing , and the doctors have confirmed the diagnosis that there is no chance he will get any better			0
' but after the charity came forward and offered to help , he said : ' this hospital is one of the best in the country and we will work with doctors in any way we can to help our boy			0
now at least there is hope			0
