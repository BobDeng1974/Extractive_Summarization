' this is a strong signal to people wanting to take part in terror operations and wars			0
' other countries , including @entity47 and the @entity48 are looking at similar measures			0
earlier this week , mr @entity11 said @entity14 must take on @entity18 to ' try to close it down now ' , warning that doing nothing would mean a ' tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door '			1
