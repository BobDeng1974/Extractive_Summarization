by @entity0 only two of nine midsize suvs got the highest rating in crash tests done by an insurance industry group			1
the @entity5 and @entity6 , both made by @entity8 , received the highest ' good ' rating from the @entity10			1
the @entity11 got the second - best ' acceptable ' rating in tests of 2014 models			1
but the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 got ' marginal ' ratings , while the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 all were rated ' poor			1
' the suvs generally performed well on six crash test measurements done by the institute			0
however , only the @entity29 got ' good ' ratings in a front overlap crash that mimics what happens when a car ’s front corner collides with another vehicle or an object like a utility pole			2
in the test , 25 percent of a vehicle ’s front end on the driver ’s side strikes a rigid barrier at 40 mph			0
failure : most of the midsize suvs did not fare well in a new small overlap front - crash test conducted by an influential @entity49 safety group , in yet another jolt to the industry already shaken by safety concerns			2
the @entity24 ( pictured ) was among the worst bottom of the class : the @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25 earned the worst rating in the small overlap crash test , despite doing well on traditional frontal and side impact tests			1
a @entity24 spokeswoman said the @entity24 was designed before the @entity10 began its new crash test the test , instituted in 2012 , is more difficult than the @entity49 government ’s frontal crash test , in which a car strikes a rigid barrier head - on at 35 mph			1
@entity10 says hitting only part of the front end makes it harder for cars to manage the energy from a crash			2
the test ' continues to challenge manufacturers more than a year and a half after its introduction , ' the institute said in a statement			0
the institute uses its crash test scores to prod automakers into adding safety devices or making their cars more crash - resistant			2
the institute said the @entity29 , which are almost identical , were modified by @entity8 in the new model year to strengthen their front structure and door - hinge pillars			0
making the grade : @entity5 and @entity6 from the @entity8 were the only vehicles to earn the highest rating of " good " in the test , according to results released by the @entity10 in tests , the @entity96 ’s space was well - maintained , and the crash dummy ’s movement was well - controlled , the institute said			1
the institute changed its requirements for vehicles to get the ' @entity104 ' designation this year			0
to earn that , vehicles must get ' good ' ratings in four crash tests , ' good ' or ' acceptable ' in the overlap test , and they must have available a front crash prevention system that either warns the driver of a crash or stops the vehicle with automatic braking			1
of the nine midsize suvs , only the @entity29 and the highlander qualified for “ ' op @entity104			0
' the @entity25 was the worst performer of the group , largely because the driver ’s space was seriously compromised in the overlap test , the institute said			0
@entity25 said in a statement that with each redesign , the pilot has been a leader in light - truck safety and driver - assist technologies ' and we are committed that it will continue to do so in the future			0

the new @entity10 crash tests looks at the safety of @entity133
of nine models tested by the @entity10 , only the @entity5 and the @entity6 received the highest rating
the @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity138 got marginal ratings
*researchers* say the results show manufacturers what *improvements* they need to make
