' a @entity80 judge who handles media affairs , @entity148 , said the defendants were unlikely to get a full and concerted defence in the highly publicised case			0

the absence of determined defence may mean that the crew 's side of the story - whether , for instance , they were adequately trained or whether they were given strict orders to abandon ship - may never be heard in court			1
one lawyer , appearing for one of the crew in hearings held behind closed doors to decide the validity of arrest warrants , confessed to being torn between professional obligation and the resignation that lawyers could not make any difference amid a nationwide witch hunt			2
