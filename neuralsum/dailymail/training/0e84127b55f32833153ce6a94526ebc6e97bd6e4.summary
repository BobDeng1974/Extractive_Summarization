police have identified the mother of ' @entity2 ' , a little girl whose body was found dumped in a cooler off a @entity5 highway more than two decades ago			1
@entity7 cold case detectives had renewed their investigation this summer after highway workers in 1991 found the child , believed to be between three and five years old , tied with rope and squeezed into a picnic cooler beneath full cans of @entity14 , off the @entity15			1
new information was revealed today after authorities received a tip from a woman who believes she knows the sister of ' @entity21 '			2
the first picture is a current , age - progression sketch of @entity21 , the second is the sketch released in 1991 , and the third photo is of the cooler which the child was found inside write caption he grisly discovery : the cooler containing @entity2 was found in @entity35 , on an embankment off the @entity15 police have conducted follow - up interviews and confirmed the mother 's identity using scientific evidence , a source told the @entity43			1
no names were being released as the case remains a murder investigation and no charges have been brought so far			0
in july , around the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved case , police circulated the neighborhood around @entity51 in @entity35 near the wooded area where the child was found , speaking to residents and offering a $ 12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction			1
the little girl had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia			1
she was naked except for a hair - tie with yellow plastic baubles on it			0
she had black hair and was white , possibly @entity67			0
the child was badly decomposed , making her facial features unrecognizable , and no one came forward to claim her			1
no one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few clues			1
according to police sources on monday , someone called the tip line in july claiming to have spoken to a woman whose sister had been killed			0
hopeful : locals examine a poster put up by police in july 2013 in the area where @entity85 was found in @entity5 outpouring : ( @entity87 ) the gravesite of @entity21 , paid for by the @entity7 's 34th precinct and ( right ) a sketch of what @entity85 may have looked like even for hardened @entity5 cops , the case was a sad and grisly one			2
detectives named the girl ' @entity21 ' , in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find out who she was and what happened to her			1
two years after her discovery , @entity85 was buried in @entity102 's ceremony			0
the police of the 34th @entity104 pooled their money and paid for her gravestone			0
she was buried in a white communion dress			0
years passed , and still no one came forward			2
in 2007 , @entity85 's body was exhumed to try and extract a dna sample , but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible			0
a second attempt in 2011 , using improved technology yielded a complete dna profile , and police immediately ran a check on all their convicted felon and missing persons databases but came up empty - handed			2
changing neighborhood : @entity35 has one of the lowest crime rates in @entity124 , but in the ' 80s and early ' 90s , when @entity85 was killed , the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity ' it 's hard for me to believe that nobody knows who she is , ' detective @entity129 told the @entity43 in 1991			1
the officer in charge of the case , he was accustomed to searching for missing persons			2
' we have the opposite , ' he said			0
we do n't know who she is			0
' now , 22 years later , detective @entity142 echoes him : ' i feel somebody knows who this girl was , ' he told the @entity148			2
hope : police canvass the neighborhood in @entity35 where the little girl 's body was found 22 years ago perhaps @entity21 ' had little girlfriends that are grown now and know something was n’t right on the block when she was gone '			1
' everything about this case is already out there , ' sergeant @entity160 , a police spokesman , told @entity43			0
“ they ’re hoping that somebody who has n’t come out sees this			0
' at the time of @entity85 's death in 1991 , @entity35 was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence			1
now , it has one of the lowest crime rates in @entity124 and families with young children walk the streets with impunity			1
there are a lot of new faces , but police are optimistic that some of the older members of the community remember the case of @entity21 .			0
