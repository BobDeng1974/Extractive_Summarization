the world 's fastest sailboat will attempt to achieve one of the greatest feats in the sport by breaking the transpacific speed record crossing			1
the state - of - the - art vessel @entity7 has been dubbed ' the flying boat ' as it combines leading technology from both the aeronautic and marine industries			1
@entity13 yachtsman @entity12 , who designed the experimental boat , is leading the record - breaking attempt from @entity16 to @entity17			1
the vessel and the rest of the team , architect @entity33 , and teammates @entity34 and @entity36 , are currently in @entity37 preparing to launch the attempt			2
they will set off at the end of may but have not set a date because it will depend on the perfect weather conditions			0
the @entity7 is able to achieve world - record speeds through its drag - minimising design			1
the boat rises above the sea surface to eliminate resistance using its ' marine wings ' , which are under each of the floats of the trimaran			1
its name is even taken from the @entity54 for water and wing			0
once the boat reaches ten knots , the underwater wings , generate an upward thrust to raise the boat like the wing of a plane			2
the pioneering sailing team of ( from left to right ) @entity65 , @entity12 and @entity34 the foils of the vessel withstand twice as much pressure as the wings of a jet fighter the boat , pictured in front of @entity73 , already holds the outright sailboat speed world record the hull and the floats then fly five metres above the sea surface and just 2.5 square metres of the boat is in contact with the water			1
in feat of engineering , the ship 's foils manage to withstand a huge amount of pressure , which is estimated to be twice as much pressure as the wings of a jet fighter			0
the boat can accelerate from 20 to 45 knots in just ten seconds			2
@entity7 broke the outright sailboat speed world record in 2009 when it sustained a speed of 52.86 knots for 500metres in just 30 knots of wind			1
the same year she broke the 50 knot barrier for a nautical mile in @entity13			1
development on the extraordinary trimaran began more than 20 years ago and is made from carbon fibre and titanium			0
@entity7 , pictured under the @entity103 , accelerates from 20 to 45 knots in just ten seconds when @entity7 is in flight just two square metres of the vessel is in contact with the water			1
it can reach a maximum speed of 56 knots and accelerate from 20 to 40 knots in just ten seconds			2
the acceleration is faster than a 2 @entity115 @entity114 speedboat			0
the vessel requires 12 knots to take off but can then travel at twice the wind speed			1
it will launch a bid to break the @entity122 record at the beginning of june			1
mr @entity12 said the team that has been put together is exceptional			0
he said : ' @entity34 and @entity36 participated in the first flights of @entity7 in the 90s			1
we made the first trials together and experienced unforgettable moments			0
' @entity130 joined me in 2005 and we crossed the 50 knot speed barrier together			2
he is an impressive helmsman			0
' mr @entity36 said they will be in period of ' stand - by ' until june as they wait for the best weather			1
he said : ' in june the position of the @entity141 anticyclone is ideal because it provides the most direct route to @entity143			0
' the thermal wind is active in this season and we will quickly leave the @entity37 coast			0
' then we will surf the long @entity141 swell downwind and we will probably have to make a gibe close the @entity150			0
' the sailors have their sights set of further records and want to break the average sailing speed barrier of 80 knots			2
in the trimaran , the team also want to cross the @entity158 in three days and cross the barrier of one thousand nautical miles in 24 hours			0
mr @entity12 said : ' we have considerable experience in the field of foils and high speed			0
with these three challenges , we have an ambitious program in the short , medium and long term			0
' technology , human adventure and pioneering spirit will always be the core of the project			2

@entity7 will try to break the @entity122 record when it sets sail in june
@entity13 - designed vessel already holds outright sailboat speed world record
pioneering boat uses technology from aeronautic and marine industries
