file picture surgeons cutting the wrong part of the body , dirty instruments and leaving equipment inside patients during operations has resulted in 35,000 of people needing extra hospital treatment in a decade , it has emerged			1
patients groups have branded the sharp 100 per cent rise in patients being re-admitted to hospital after botched operations , ' shocking and frightening '			1
figures released under @entity25 laws , found that in 2012 5,328 people had to be re-admitted to hospital following botched operations			0
that figure is a jump from 2,641 patients in 2003			0
the main reason given for re-admissions doubling in a decade is ' unintentional cuts , punctures , perforations or haemorrhages ' or bleeding			0
@entity40 's @entity39 told the @entity41 : ' the level of @entity44 mistakes is shocking and frightening			0
' we should n't have to fear going home with the wrong part of our body mutilated			2
' over the 10 - year period a total of 35,000 patients have needed further treatment after blunders of these kinds , but the year - on - year figures have risen from 2,462 in 2003 to 5,139 in 2012			1
the number of patients taken back into the operating theatre after surgeons left ' foreign objects ' inside their patients has remained the same			2
last year 164 ' never ' events - dubbed that , due to the serious nature of the incident and fact it should never occur - were recorded by the @entity66 , up from 138 in 2003			2

twenty - five incidents relating to dirty theatres or instruments were recorded last year - the lowest on record - compared with 41 in 2003			2
two surgeons , speaking to the @entity41 anonymously , said a reason for the rise could be the fact more complex procedures are being carried out in hospitals across the @entity88 , than was the case 10 years ago			0
a further explanation put forward is that a campaign towards greater transparency in the @entity44 as a whole has resulted in a more open culture of reporting mistakes			0
a @entity66 spokesperson said : ' patient safety must be the priority for the @entity44 and it is unacceptable ' never events ' occur			1
thankfully , the incidents are relatively rare			0
