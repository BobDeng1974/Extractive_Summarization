by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 06:56 est , 11 july 2013 a fit and healthy young man died at the age of 21 because of an undiagnosed and deadly heart condition			1
@entity4 , a carer , had a ‘ work hard , play hard ’ attitude and enjoyed regular games of football with his friends			2
but he enjoyed life and his work not realising he had the potentially fatal heart condition coronary artery anomalies			1
the condition means that blood is fed into the heart from the body ’s main artery , the aorta , from only one side			1
@entity4 , 21 , died from a rare and undiagnosed heart condition which meant that blood was only fed to his heart from one side of his aorta it can be aggravated by exercise as a problem artery can be squashed or kinked under the pressure of more blood being pumped to the heart			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity29 , near @entity30 , @entity31 , was found dead at his family home by his parents @entity35 and @entity36 in april			1
an inquest was told six foot three inch mr @entity4 - described by his family as a ‘ gentle giant with an infectious grin ’ - had no history of poor health			1
he was said to be ‘ very family - orientated ’ and ‘ did n’t have a vicious bone in his body ’			0
his father told the hearing : ‘ he was n’t shy of work			0
he worked hard and played hard			0
he was very active with how he lived his life			0
’ his father said : ‘ he had his breakfast then went back to his bed			0
he came back downstairs and spoke to us , he was his normal self			0
‘ there was absolutely nothing to indicate there was a problem at all			0
he was just his normal self			0
’ however , when his parents returned from a shopping trip later that day they found their son ’s lifeless body slumped against a door			1
mr @entity4 , who worked as a carer , was not aware that he had the condition and had no history of ill health his father desperately attempted to revive him before paramedics arrived , but his son was pronounced dead a short time later			1
@entity72 dr @entity71 said mr @entity4 ’s death would have been very sudden and unexpected			1
he said he died from natural causes , the sudden death being down to an anomaly of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinuses			1
he added : ‘ it is a condition that would not normally have any symptoms			2
’ mr @entity81 strongly advised the couple to encourage their two other sons , aged 24 and 26 , to go for a medical check - up			0
returning a verdict of death by natural causes he added : ‘ @entity4 was a young man who lived life to the full to work hard and play hard - exactly how you would want to have a son			1
‘ it is devastating for you to go out shopping and you come home to find him collapsed			2
i am so dreadfully sorry , i can not imagine what it would be like , it is devastating			0
’ mr @entity4 was found dead at home by his parents , @entity35 and @entity101 , when they returned from a shopping trip			1
@entity103 shows the heart and circulatory system in a statement @entity4 ’s family said : ‘ he would put his big arm around you			2
he was just a lovely lad			0
‘ he loved his mum to bits			0
he loved caring for people and talking to the residents			0
he was such a caring person and all the patients loved him			0
’ a spokesman for the charity @entity118 said : ‘ in 1 in 100 people both coronary arteries come from the same side of the aorta			2
this is called an “ anomalous coronary origin ” or “ coronary artery anomaly ”			1
‘ the unusual origin of the artery means that the artery must take a different route to supply the heart muscle			2
in the majority of people this causes no problems			0
‘ however , in a small number , the abnormal route can cause the anomalous coronary artery to be squashed or kinked during exercise			1
‘ if the blood supply to the heart is disturbed then it can cause chest pains or dangerous arrhythmias			2
the cause of coronary artery anomalies is not known			1
however , in most cases they do not appear to be inherited			0

@entity4 had a heart condition called coronary artery anomalies which meant blood was only fed to his heart from one side of his aorta
had never had any health problems and was not aware of the condition
was found dead at home by his parents , @entity35 and @entity36
coroner returned verdict of death by natural causes
