teenage winger @entity0 grabbed two tries as @entity2 eased back to winning ways with a 50 - 12 victory over the 12 - man @entity5 in @entity7			1
@entity0 , 17 , bagged a try in each half on just his second senior appearance as the @entity2 sentenced the @entity11 , who had @entity13 dismissed just before the break , to their 15th successive @entity16 defeat			1
@entity17 also added a brace for @entity2 , who outscored their opponents nine tries to two in a largely one - sided encounter			1
starring role : @entity0 , left , scored two tries for @entity2 as they thrashed @entity5 ahead of kick - off , @entity25 moved from full - back to a first start at stand - off for the hosts , while @entity31 replaced @entity32 at prop			1
@entity2 made two changes of their own , @entity35 and @entity36 coming in for former @entity38 @entity37 and @entity39 respectively			2
despite putting @entity7 to the sword 40 - 4 on their own turf five weeks ago , @entity2 entered the contest on the back of four straight defeats			2
and they were on the back foot here within six minutes , @entity47 charging down @entity49 's clearing kick and flopping over the line for the opening score			0
@entity2 were mightily close to hauling themselves level when @entity53 hauled down @entity35 as he looked to cross in the corner			2
but the reprieve proved temporary for the home side as @entity25 's spill was seized on by @entity58 , who cantered over the line on 12 minutes to help level the scores			0
dismissed : @entity13 ( @entity61 ) of @entity7 was red carded for a dangerous arm swinging tackle on @entity0 it was real end - to - end stuff , with @entity7 's @entity65 and @entity2 's @entity66 both having tries chalked off for forward passes			1
@entity0 was not to be denied on 22 minutes though , taking a pass from @entity70 to ease in at the corner			0
@entity2 were growing in stature , with the @entity11 being forced back thanks to a string of penalties			0
and the @entity2 cashed in one such infringement for their third try , @entity78 stepping inside and out to rumble over the line from close range			0
handling errors were continuing to dog the @entity5 , and , after the hosts once again knocked on in their own territory , @entity81 raced in at the corner after a flowing handling move involving @entity35 and @entity70 to help make it 22 - 6			2
much - needed : the win ended a run of four successive defeats for @entity2 and continued @entity5 ' misery things went from bad to worse for @entity7 moments later , with hooker @entity13 seeing red after a hit on @entity66			1
to their credit , @entity7 emerged fired up for the second half , despite being consistently penalised by referee @entity99			0
and the @entity5 converted that tempo into points when @entity53 powered over after a short pass from @entity103 on 47 minutes			0
@entity2 , having really taken their foot off the gas , finally sprang back into life midway through the half , @entity107 breaking the @entity7 defence and offloading for @entity109 to cruise over			0
the visitors were on the front foot again , @entity66 close to claiming his second score when his lunge for the line came up inches short			0
but a sixth try did come for @entity2 on 66 minutes , @entity78 notching his second when he shrugged off weak @entity5 tackling to stride over			1
by now it was a case of how many tries @entity2 would run in , and @entity0 got his name on the scoresheet again when @entity70 's pass gave him a free run to the corner			1
there was still time for @entity2 to run in two further late tries , @entity49 and @entity129 crossing after good work from @entity81 and @entity131 respectively			0
rock bottom : that defeat leaves @entity5 anchored to the foot of the @entity16 but @entity2 move to 10th			1

hull end four - game losing streak in style with *thumping* win
@entity5 remain *rooted* to bottom of @entity16
@entity0 scores two tries on second senior appearance for @entity2
@entity13 sent off for @entity5 as they lose 15th successive league game
