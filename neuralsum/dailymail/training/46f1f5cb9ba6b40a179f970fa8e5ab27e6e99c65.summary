continuing our occasional series on the hotels favoured by the rich and famous , @entity0 takes a peek at the @entity6 resort in @entity7 - where @entity8 tops up her tan			1
@entity11 quality : @entity8 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 vital statistics : a @entity17 palace of excellence in @entity7 , set high on the cliffs , the terracotta walls of the @entity6 shore up the @entity22 's most luxurious hotels			1
surrounded by extravagant tropical gardens , you 'll find nearly 500 suites and rooms amid its shady courtyards			0
@entity29 position : the @entity6 resort sits in a secluded spot on the west coast of reliably sunny @entity7 its cliff - top setting means that you 'll be whisked down to the beach by a cable car , but if you want to stay put there are nine swimming pools , including an infinity pool at the cliff 's edge that looks out across to the island of @entity44			1
the @entity46 's unabashed luxury continues with two @entity48 - starred restaurants			1
@entity49 comes under the supervision of @entity51 , with classic @entity53 cuisine			0
@entity54 serves @entity55 in a sleek red and black interior			0
eight others include @entity58 , which specialises in seafood and has views of the ocean			0
during school holidays , the bankers of @entity63 descend en masse with their young children			0
if you want to escape beautifully dressed eurotots , head to the @entity70 villas			0
the most exclusive ( and expensive ) of all the @entity46 's rooms are reserved for over 18s only , with complimentary drinks and snacks			0
another refuge for adults is the @entity78 's 72 - par golf course			1
considered to be one of @entity53 's finest , it brings golf - minded celebrities including @entity13 to the resort			1
recharging her batteries : @entity8 stayed at @entity6 in july with film - star husband @entity12 other sports facilities include seven tennis courts - one with seating for 600 people			1
location report : tucked away on the west coast , near @entity93 resort , which is a 15 - minute walk away along the cliff			1
the rest of the island requires a hire car			0
key attraction : privacy and the sort of luxury you would normally only find in mainland @entity63 or the @entity103			1
reliable short - haul winter sun with @entity106 finesse ( @entity108 products in the bathrooms )			2
the hotel 's extensive grounds are meticulously kept , and the beach has imported sand because the local stuff was considered to be a bit dark and gritty for the hotel			2
in the news : @entity118 and husband @entity12 were at the @entity6 in july			0
good enough for the rest of us ? technically , the @entity78 's beach is public - but access is almost impossible without going via the hotel			2
deliberately isolated , this is a resort that would prefer you to stay close , but your pockets will have to be deep - a @entity130 is € 5			2
@entity131 ( www.itcluxurytravel.co.uk , 01244 355 550 ) offers seven nights at the @entity106 , @entity78 ( www.ritzcarlton.com/abama ) including flights , transfers and @entity136 accommodation - from £ 1,025 per person .			0
