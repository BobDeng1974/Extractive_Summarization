by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity2 cricket writer @entity0 's view of day four of the third test between @entity4 and @entity5 at the @entity6 , which @entity7 inspired an @entity4 their first test victory for a year			1
@entity4 's attack , unsurprisingly , has been held together by opening bowlers @entity11 and @entity13 , who have claimed nearly half of the wickets taken since their last victory one year ago			1
top man : @entity11 has taken 47 of @entity4 's 184 wickets since their last @entity3 win the pair have taken 90 of the 184 wickets to fall			1
@entity11 has 47 at an average of 29 , @entity13 43 at 31			0
next , a long way back , is @entity24 , with 22 wickets at 32 , followed by the surprise package of @entity7 , with 18 at 32 , and @entity27 , 18 at 34			0
@entity28 was test of patience @entity4 ’s first @entity31 win in 353 days has been a miserable sequence encompassing four series , 10 tests and seven defeats			2
the drought extends back to the fourth test against @entity38 at @entity39 , which finished on august 12 , 2013			0
the five survivors from that game are @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity13 and @entity11			2
@entity4 ’s long list of losers @entity4 have picked 25 players in the 11 tests since their previous win , but 10 of them have played no more than two matches each			0
down and out : @entity51 is one of several players who has only played two tests since @entity4 's last win @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity51 , @entity57 and @entity58 played two tests ; @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 one			2
@entity11 , @entity44 , @entity13 and @entity42 are the only ever - presents			0
@entity64 had @entity4 failed to beat @entity5 in @entity66 , it would have been their longest winless streak since they went 18 tests without success from january 1987 until august 1988			1
no @entity69 the leading performers with the bat during the drought have been @entity43 , with 822 runs at an average of 51 , and @entity75 , with 628 at 62			2
mvp : @entity43 ( @entity77 ) , being congratulated by @entity78 , has scored the most runs during @entity4 's drought between them , the @entity82 pair have scored five of the nine centuries compiled by @entity4 batsmen during the winless streak			1
@entity5 ’s @entity87 struggle to land two in a row the result , following on from @entity5 ’s victory at @entity90 , backed up the tourists ’ habit of rarely stringing together impressive performances away from home			0
the last time they won two in a row in the same series outside @entity5 against a team other than @entity102 or @entity103 was in 1986 , when they beat @entity4 at @entity90 and @entity105			1
inconsistent : @entity5 have not managed two consecutive test wins against a decent side since 1986			0

@entity4 beat @entity5 in the third @entity31 to level the series
it was the first @entity112 victory since defeating @entity38 in aug , 2013
@entity13 and @entity11 have taken nearly half of @entity4 's wickets during that time
@entity43 and @entity75 have been @entity4 's leading run scorers sine their last victory
