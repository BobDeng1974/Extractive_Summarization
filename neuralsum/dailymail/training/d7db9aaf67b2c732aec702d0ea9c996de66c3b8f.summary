solicitor - general @entity0 is claimed to have been a member of the @entity2 25 for nearly a decade a @entity4 mp has denied attempting to avoid tax after being named as an investor in a film partnership scheme under investigation by the tax man			1
solicitor - general @entity0 is claimed to have been a member of the @entity2 25 for nearly a decade			1
the scheme is thought to be under investigation by @entity13 ( @entity13 ) into whether it is a legitimate business or whether it was primarily set up as a way for investors to avoid paying tax			1
it follows a court ruling against two other film partnership schemes in 2011 that found they were primarily used for tax avoidance			1
mr @entity22 ’s involvement in the scheme is potentially hugely embarrassing for @entity24 who has pledged to tackle tax avoidance			1
the revelation comes just days after mr @entity24 faced questions in the @entity27 about @entity28 , the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife , being based in a tax haven			2
mr @entity22 insisted that the companies he invested in were beyond reproach			2
in a statement , the @entity4 mp for @entity34 , said : ‘ i have not attempted to avoid tax , and my investments are a matter of public record			1
‘ before making them i asked an independent , accredited financial adviser to look into the companies , who found them to be completely beyond reproach			2
‘ @entity13 look into many different types of investments , but i have been assured that there is no active investigation into my tax affairs			1
‘ i pay my taxes as required each year , and i have been fully open with government officials and declared my interests in line with usual reporting processes			0
’ the office of the attorney general would not comment on whether mr @entity22 had provided legal advice on tax avoidance issues			2
the @entity59 reported mr @entity22 had joined the @entity2 no 25 scheme in 2005 , but a memo sent to members last year showed it was now ‘ the subject of an open @entity13 inquiry ’			1
@entity13 has declined to comment on the case			1
the partnership is a sale and leaseback scheme where the rights to a film are bought and then leased back to its producers			2
film partnership schemes were intended to boost the @entity74 film industry by offering tax breaks for investors of low budget films			1
but tax tribunal ruled in 2011 that investors in two film partnership schemes were not entitled to claim the tax relief as they were primarily being used for tax avoidance rather than for business purposes			1
most tax inquiries involving such schemes are currently at a standstill as the ruling is subject to appeal			2
chancellor @entity89 has branded ‘ aggressive tax avoidance ’ as ' morally repugnant ’ following a number of high - profile cases involving celebrities , the @entity92 government pledged to crack down on tax avoidance – which is legal			0
chancellor @entity89 deemed ‘ aggressive tax avoidance ’ to be ‘ morally repugnant ’			0
on saturday , @entity97 leader @entity96 said : ‘ there is nothing pro-business about defending tax avoidance			0
’ he added : ‘ i am not going to back down			0
the time has finally come to put an end to a society in which one group of people can play by different rules to the rest			0
’ last year after mr @entity22 , a barrister , was appointed solicitor - general , it emerged that he had been found to have breached the legal profession 's code of conduct in 2011			0
a spokesman for the attorney general 's office said at the time : ‘ it is a matter of public record that in may 2011 , @entity22 was found to have committed a minor breach of the @entity118 of the @entity119			0
‘ he was not suspended or fined and continued to practice and sit as a recorder			0
‘ this finding was removed from the @entity123 records after two years and therefore mr @entity22 was not required to declare it upon appointment as solicitor general			0
’ last week it emerged that @entity129 ’s employer @entity28 is owned through a holding company in @entity131 and linked to a secretive trust in the @entity133 of @entity134 , another well - known tax haven			0
the leather goods and luxury stationery firm , which has a store on new @entity139 that sells £ 2,000 python skin handbags , has employed mrs @entity129 as a creative consultant since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £ 100,000 a year .			0
