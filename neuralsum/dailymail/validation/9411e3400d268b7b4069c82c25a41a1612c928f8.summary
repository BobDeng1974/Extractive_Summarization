emotional @entity1 coach @entity0 has launched a scathing attack on his own players following saturday 's lackluster 20 - 13 defeat to @entity5 in the @entity6 , saying the team has become ' the @entity8 of international rugby ' because it gives away so many points			1
his voice trembling with emotion , @entity0 looked on the verge of tears sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down			1
' international rugby is about combat , humility			1
but above all it 's a collective sport			0
we do n't need starlets , ' he said			0
' in rugby , the team is the star and we need champions			1
yesterday , i did n't see any champions , or not many			0
' @entity0 looked on the verge of tears sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down @entity33 scores a try for @entity1 during the @entity6 match against @entity5 at the @entity1 @entity1 , which has lost its past four games to @entity5 in the tournament , lost 18 - 11 to @entity38 and narrowly beat @entity39 at home in its opener			1
next up is a tricky away match in @entity43 followed by a full - blooded showdown with @entity45 at @entity46			2
flyhalf @entity47 was particularly poor , missing two of his four penalty kicks - and @entity52 's first - half try was ruled out because of @entity54 's careless forward pass			2
' for my part , i do n't think i played badly , ' a defiant @entity54 said			0
' i tried different things ... let 's keep on daring			0
' @entity1 's scrum - half @entity60 is joined by the rest of his dejected teammates at full time his attitude may not have pleased @entity0 , who is likely to make sweeping changes for the game against @entity43 in two weeks ' time			1
asked if some players are now playing for their futures , six months ahead of the @entity68 , @entity0 replied with an emphatic ' yes ' - although he stopped short of saying some would never play for @entity1 again under his leadership			1
' i only want players who are ready to go to the @entity73			2
if anyone thinks that international rugby is too difficult , then they have my telephone number , ' he said			1
' they can call me and i 'll take someone else			0
i 'll even take a 20 - year - old lad who 's never played in the @entity81 ( @entity83 league ) before			1
' @entity84 in action during the @entity6 rugby match between @entity1 and @entity5 @entity0 , one of @entity1 's best wingers , took over after the @entity88 , where @entity1 lost 8 - 7 to @entity89 in a tense final			1
almost all of that side has gone and @entity0 has been rebuilding ever since , although his habit of constantly tinkering with the side has not helped instill continuity			1
but he feels the players should take more responsibility and show more pride			1
' i 've covered and supported them for three years			0
at some stage you need to know how to win games at the highest level , ' he said			0
' the @entity83 jersey should not only be something you 're proud of but also something that enables you to surpass yourself			0
you need to be a gladiator			0
it 's thumbs up for @entity5 star @entity109 after their win against @entity1 at the @entity1 ' we 've lost four in a row to the @entity114 , this has to stop			1
we have guys who started playing ( regularly ) three years ago and now have 30 caps			0
it 's time to stop hiding			0
' an irate @entity0 raised his voice several times during a passionate news conference			2
' at some point you have to ask the right questions			0
we 're at our level , that 's the truth , ' he said			0
' it takes the @entity114 30 seconds to score three points and it takes us four minutes			2
we 're the @entity8 of international rugby and that 's what i told the players			1
' however , @entity0 is no mood to quit			2
' i 've never abandoned ship , whether as a player , as a captain or as a manager			0
i 've been given a role : to prepare this team for the @entity68 , ' he said			2
' i 'll fight every day to do that			0
' @entity142 looks dejected as @entity1 lose to @entity5 at the @entity1 on saturday			1
