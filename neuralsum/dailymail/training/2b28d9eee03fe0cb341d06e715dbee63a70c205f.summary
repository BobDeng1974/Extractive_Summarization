@entity0 qualified for the 2015 @entity1 with an impressive 4 - 2 aggregate victory over @entity3 - yet an astonishing eight players who did not feature in the second leg of that tie would @entity8 's strongest @entity7 @entity10 goalkeeper @entity9 started in goal , with @entity13 's @entity12 and @entity15 striker @entity14 up front for @entity18 's men but there are eight eligible players who did not feature in @entity21 who could start in the @entity22 next june			1
@entity24 's @entity23 , @entity26 's @entity25 and @entity28 's @entity27 would be the star names in the @entity30 of players eligible for the tournament			1
any player who was born on or after this date is able to participate in the tournament because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began			2
interestingly , tuesday 's goalscorers in @entity0 's 2 - 1 second - leg victory - @entity50 defender @entity49 and @entity53 's @entity52 - would not feature in the side			1
with @entity9 in goal , the defence would be comprised of @entity12 at left back and @entity13 's @entity57 at right back - with @entity28 's @entity58 partnering @entity26 's @entity59 at centre back			1
a holding midfield duo of @entity27 and @entity63 's @entity62 would help control the middle of the park			2
they would be able to set the platform for @entity0 's exciting attacking midfield trio of @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity28 's @entity39 to provide the flair and pace			1
@entity14 - one of only three survivors from tuesday night in @entity35 's team - would then be given the task of firing @entity0 through the group stages and to @entity76 glory			1
formation : 4 - 3 - 3 goalkeeper : @entity9 ( @entity10 )			1
defence : @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , @entity12 ( @entity13 )			2
midfield : @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , @entity87 ( @entity81 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 )			0
forwards : @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , @entity91 ( @entity81 ) , @entity14 ( @entity15 ) * players in italics feature in both sides			2
formation : 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 goalkeeper : @entity9 ( @entity10 )			1
defence : @entity57 ( @entity13 ) @entity58 ( @entity28 ) , @entity59 ( @entity26 ) , @entity12 ( @entity13 )			0
defensive midfield : @entity62 ( @entity63 ) , @entity27 ( @entity28 )			0
attacking midfield : @entity39 ( @entity28 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , @entity23 ( @entity24 )			1
forward : @entity14 ( @entity15 )			0
* players in italics feature in both sides			0
@entity12 ( left ) played for @entity0 on tuesday and he would be one of just three players in the strongest xi players born on or after january 1 , 1992 are eligible to participate in the 2015 @entity1			1
this means that some players - such as @entity27 - will be 23 by the time of the tournament			1
yet these players are allowed to play because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began			0
if @entity0 played their strongest xi , not only would they stand a good chance of winning the tournament next year - but also of progressing in the future			1
of the @entity114 starting @entity36 who beat @entity37 4 - 0 in the 2009 euros final , five went on to lift the @entity115 in @entity116			1
@entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 all started in @entity122 on june 29 , 2009			0
encouragingly , @entity37 boss @entity18 refused to rule out including some of the star youngsters in his squad for the tournament , meaning this @entity36 could become a reality rather than a mere fantasy			2
@entity0 under 21 manager @entity18 is open to the idea of calling up the likes of @entity23 and @entity25 @entity50 's @entity49 scored one of @entity0 's two goals on tuesday but he would not make the side @entity133 beat @entity37 4 - 0 in the 2009 @entity135 final in @entity122			1
of the @entity137 side who started that day , five went on to lift the @entity115 in @entity116			0
@entity137 - @entity36 vs @entity37 ( june 29 , 2009 - players in bold lifted the @entity115 in 2014 ) : @entity117 ; @entity140 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity141 ; @entity142 ; @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity120 ( c ) , @entity121 ; @entity145			2
when asked if players such as @entity23 or @entity147 could play for his side , @entity18 said : ‘ i have been very careful throughout the ( qualifying ) campaign about who comes into the squad			1
they have to have a connection with the team and desire to come and play			0
i never worry about who i have n’t got and i ’m not going to start now			0
‘ you can drive yourself to distraction			0
we could write a team sheet with illustrious names not involved here			0
the fact is , i believe we have such depth that we can challenge whoever we are playing with whatever players we put out on the pitch			0
‘ there may have been cases where some players have n’t fitted in to what we are doing			0
i certainly have n’t had a club pull out a player and thought , “ that ’s a bit off ”			0
managers and coaches at clubs have been really supportive - and i do n’t think that will change			0
’ @entity120 ( left ) and @entity118 ( right ) played for @entity133 in the 4 - 0 final victory over @entity37 at the 2009 euros in @entity122 and they were two of five players to lift the @entity115 in 2014			2

@entity0 qualified for 2015 under - 21 @entity135 on tuesday
@entity18 's men beat @entity3 4 - 2 on aggregate to progress
but just three of starting @entity36 on tuesday make @entity35 's strongest side
only @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity14 retain their places
@entity27 , @entity23 , @entity39 and @entity25 among players who are available for @entity22 tournament
