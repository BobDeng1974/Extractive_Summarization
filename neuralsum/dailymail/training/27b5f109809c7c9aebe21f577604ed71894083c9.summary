hospitals and gps are to be ordered to go to war with the @entity4 ’s worst ‘ silent killer ’ in a crackdown that health watchdogs say should save 12,500 lives a year			1
those that fail to tackle sepsis will be financially penalised , health secretary @entity8 revealed yesterday			1
the condition – also known as septicaemia , or blood poisoning – kills 31,000 people annually in @entity16			1
hospitals and gps are to be ordered to tackle sepsis , which kills 31,000 people in @entity16 a year , or face financial penalties ( file picture ) it is to be treated in the same way as hospital superbugs , which have been halved in the last few years			1
every gp surgery in @entity16 is to be audited between now and next march on its effectiveness at diagnosing the condition with a view to making necessary improvements			1
mr @entity8 said that a new system for detecting sepsis in children under five is to be introduced in doctors ’ practices and hospitals , before being extended to adult patients			2
and in hospitals , new targets will be set for diagnosis and treatment – with financial incentives for those that perform best			2
@entity16 will launch a public awareness campaign on the symptoms of sepsis , aimed at those most at risk			1
@entity49 , the body responsible for education and training in the @entity4 , will try to ensure healthcare workers receive better training about the condition			0
sepsis is a severe form of blood poisoning which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection , attacking organs such as the heart , liver , kidneys and lungs			1
it causes fever , inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure			0
research suggests that opportunities to save lives are routinely missed because of delays in identifying the condition			1
the plans have been announced by health secretary @entity8 , who said that a new system for detecting sepsis in children under five is to be introduced in doctors ’ practices and hospitals sepsis accounts for 100,000 hospital admissions each year , and costs the @entity4 an average of about £ 20,000 per patient			1
in @entity16 , 1,000 children under five are admitted to paediatric intensive care units annually due to severe sepsis , of whom 10 per cent will die			1
it has become a more common reason for hospital admission than a heart attack , and has a higher mortality rate			0
failings occur mainly in the first hours after arriving at a @entity99 surgery or hospital , when rapid diagnosis and treatment with intravenous antibiotics can be critical to the chances of survival			0
@entity106 , the @entity107 , first highlighted the problems with the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in a report last year featuring cases of avoidable death			2
‘ we warmly welcome these actions across the health system on recognising and treating sepsis , which taken together could help save up to 12,500 lives each year , ’ she said			1
the plans were in part inspired by the case of three - year - old @entity123 , who died in december 2010 following delays in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis			2
the ombudsman found that @entity123 , from @entity129 , would almost certainly have survived had he been given antibiotics sooner			0
mr @entity8 told the @entity131 he wanted to make tackling sepsis as important to the @entity4 as tackling the superbugs @entity134 and @entity135			0
‘ there has already been good progress , ’ the health secretary said			0
‘ we have virtually halved @entity134 and @entity135 infection rates in the last four years			0
‘ sepsis kills more than 80 people in @entity16 every day			1
it ’s time to apply the lessons we ’ve already learnt on patient safety and reduce the number of lives that are needlessly lost to this silent killer			0
’ sepsis is a virulent form of blood poisoning which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection , usually bacterial			1
the infection can attack organs such as the heart , kidneys , liver and lungs , causing fever , inflammation , abnormal blood clotting , shock as a result of plummeting blood pressure and , eventually , multi-organ failure			0
sepsis is one of the biggest killers of hospital patients , but it is also possible to develop the condition outside hospital as a result of having a minor infection			2
prompt diagnosis of sepsis is essential followed rapidly by treatment – delay is associated with greater risk of death			0
intravenous antibiotics are the first line of treatment , along with oxygen , fluids and medication to increase blood pressure			0
the most common causes of severe sepsis are pneumonia , bowel perforation , urinary infection , and severe skin infections			0
dialysis for kidney failure and breathing support for respiratory failure are necessary for the worst affected cases			0
experts say sepsis is becoming more common , partly because of a rising number of elderly people with weakened immune systems or underlying diseases such as cancer .			2

hospitals and gps which fail to tackle sepsis face financial penalties
health watchdogs believe the plans should save 12,500 lives a year
plans to tackle condition , known as blood poisoning , announced yesterday
sepsis kills 31,000 people annually in @entity16 every year
