only six of the models were ever produced after @entity3 boss @entity8 wanted a sports car with room for his shotguns and dogs to take on his regular hunting trips			1
his team of designers came up with the 1965 @entity16			2
the rare @entity3 , converted into an estate car , is up for sale at a @entity20 auction house this week the car was designed by @entity3 after the company 's boss @entity8 wanted a sports car that had room for his shotguns and dogs mr @entity8 wanted a car that he could take to the country for hunting - and coachbuilders @entity30 converted only six @entity31 into spacious vehicles @entity34 coachbuilders @entity30 then converted the six @entity35 into the longer and larger versions of the vehicle			1
although the front looks like a classic @entity3 , its rear end is large and practical with plenty of space in the boot			0
now the car is worth twice as much as its @entity3 cousin			1
it has air conditioning and has powerful and superior @entity48 specifications			0
the @entity3 , which has an all - aluminium straight six engine , will be auctioned by @entity51 auctioneers in @entity20 this week			0
the car is believed to have been ordered in 1967 or 1968 by a @entity53 , of @entity54 , @entity55 , which is why it is a left hand drive			1
a @entity51 spokesman said : ' this @entity3 was clearly used in the @entity58 as it carried a @entity58 registration			0
' close inspection of the car reveals a remarkably original and unspoilt car			1
a @entity3 complete with roof rack is an unusual find - hence the expected sale price of £ 400,000 the original leather interior is still intact in this customised left hand drive it may not be as sleek as the more familiar @entity3 , but being only one of six , it 's worth twice as much as its cousins ' the original leather beige interior remains in place and from stem to stern the car has the feeling of being as it was when its conversion was finished , complete with period luggage rack on its roof			2
' as @entity3 values continue to escalate , it is the rarest variants that are the most sought - after and in that respect , they do n't come much better than this			0
' @entity48 , air - conditioning , left hand drive and with space to actually carry a decent sized picnic or hunting equipment this ultra rare @entity87 will stand out from the crowd			2
' the @entity3 goes under the hammer at @entity51 in @entity94 , @entity20 , on february 23 .			0
