a series of little - known channels have been severely criticised for allowing ‘ inflammatory ’ material to be broadcast			1
among the cases is an @entity6 scholar who told viewers that it is their ‘ duty ’ to ‘ kill those who insult @entity21 ’			2
in another a woman presenter said homosexuals should be beaten and tortured for the ‘ evil , shameful act			0
’ @entity25 , the communications watchdog , found the stations broke the broadcasting code by allowing the extreme opinions to be aired unchallenged			1
but the breaches highlighted fears that extreme @entity32 speakers , previously confined to mosques , could reach larger audiences			0
the rulings came despite a 2010 report warning extremist material was being broadcast on channels aimed at @entity32 communities			0
it found the @entity41 , @entity8 ’s largest @entity6 broadcaster , had continued to ignore rules about impartiality and allowed controversial viewpoints to be aired			1
@entity46 , who wrote the report for @entity48 , an anti-extremist think - tank , told the @entity50 the ‘ shocking ’ incidents raised serious questions over broadcast regulation			2
he said : ‘ if this had happened in a mosque the police would be right in pursuing a criminal investigation			0
‘ but because they are being broadcast on television channels for some reason there seems to be little appetite for looking into these extreme messages			2
‘ if these kind of comments were made against black people , for example , you can imagine a channel being shut down overnight , particularly if they had incited violence against a minority			0
’ among the shows criticised was one broadcast by @entity4 - based @entity2 , co-owned by dr @entity3 , who was banned from entering @entity8 in 2010 for the ‘ public good ’			1
it broadcast the phrase : ‘ one group of scholars , they say that if a @entity32 , if he becomes a non-muslim he should be put to death			0
’ dr @entity3 , who is based in @entity82 , put a sermon online in 2006 which said ‘ every muslim should be a terrorist			1
’ another broadcast by @entity88 was criticised by @entity25 for ‘ serious breaches ’ , and highlighted how inflammatory talk can incite violence			1
the show said : ‘ there is absolutely no doubt about it that the punishment for the person who shows disrespect for the @entity21 is death			2
no one disagrees about this			0
’ @entity25 found the stations broke the broadcasting code by allowing the extreme opinions to be aired unchallenged last december @entity105 , in @entity106 , was fined £ 4,000 for breaching broadcasting rules in programmes involving a presenter called ‘ @entity110 ’			1
she told listeners homosexuals should be beaten and tortured , adding : ‘ torture them ; punish them ; beat them and give them mental torture			0
’ @entity119 , based in @entity120 , has been found in breach of the code twice in 18 months for programmes which denigrated a minority muslim sect			1
@entity25 said the minority group were labelled a ‘ disease ’ and ‘ monstrous ’ intentions and it will now consider an ‘ appropriate ’ punishment			1
the channels have small audiences compared with the mainstream and are aimed at @entity32 communities , with some content broadcast in @entity134 and other languages			0
in some cases the channels also breached a rule that they must keep recordings of all output , raising the possibility other inflammatory material was broadcast undetected			0
an @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ the majority of @entity6 channels comply with our rules			2
however , where we identify issues through our monitoring or complaints we investigate fully and take firm enforcement action			0

@entity25 found stations broke broadcasting code by allowing extreme opinions to be aired unchallenged
