@entity1 aircraft carrier @entity0 could continue its life as a disaster relief ship - despite getting a radical makeover as a luxury yacht			1
bold plans have reimagined the 31 - year - old vessel , which leaves @entity9 service later this year , as the ' @entity10 ' with three modern ' sails ' containing bedrooms , restaurants and conference suites towering above deck			1
yet below deck the 23,000 - tonne vessel could still contain a hospital , heavy - duty trucks and equipment to help in a global disaster , designers claim			1
bold : the design for @entity0 , @entity1 's last current serving aircraft carrier , features three ' sails ' with restaurants and conference centres above deck - but a hospital and disaster relief supplies below it flight of fancy ? the ' dual use ' idea has been put forward to the @entity30 , though it is unclear how it would be funded iconic : @entity0 , pictured returning to @entity32 from the @entity33 on friday , is the last of three aircraft carriers to be replaced by the @entity9			1
unlike its sister ships , it could avoid the scrap yard the ship , which returned from an aid mission to the typhoon - hit @entity33 on friday , will be the last of the @entity9 's three invincible class light aircraft carriers to be decommissioned later this year			1
the controversial decision will leave @entity1 without a single aircraft carrier until two new £ 6 billion vessels enter service in 2020			0
unlike @entity44 and the @entity45 , which ended up in @entity47 scrapyards , the @entity30 said it wanted to find a new use for @entity0 and invited firms to bid for it			1
the @entity10 plan is one of the first to be made public and was the brainchild of two yacht design firms from @entity1 and @entity54			0
the futuristic drawings replace planes on the flight deck with swimming pools and instead of militaristic control towers would be the modern ' sails '			2
futuristic : two yacht design firms from @entity1 and @entity54 say the ship could retain its ski - jump take - off ramp blue sky thinking : the aircraft carrier 's militaristic control tower would be replaced with ' sails ' which look more at home on a cruise ship , alongside swimming pools where jets once resided on the flight deck illustrious : the ship was one of three light aircraft carriers in the invincible series and the last to leave service yet the ship could still be used actively as an aircraft carrier with its ski - jump take - off ramp remaining intact - providing a curious experience for those having a quiet swim			1
its designers , @entity32 - based @entity83 @entity82 and the @entity85 firm @entity84 , say it would be used to promote trade in the @entity10 and host conferences			2
then if a global disaster happened it would spring into action , using its resources below deck			0
exact details of the plan , including how much it would cost , have not been announced publicly			0
an organisation willing to fund and run the hybrid design - such as a charity or the @entity99 - would also have to be persuaded to take it on and possibly tweak the design to their own purposes			2
no organisation has yet agreed to do so , it is believed			0
@entity84 owner @entity105 said : ' we are hoping to convince the @entity30 that this carrier has a life after the @entity9			2
crucial role : the ship returned to @entity32 harbour on friday from relief efforts in the @entity33 vast : pictured arriving on friday , the ship weighs about 23,000 tonnes and is 636ft long , carrying 650 crew when the ship is axed , @entity1 will be without an aircraft carrier until two vessels enter service in 2020 stormy times ahead : the crew of @entity0 salute as she arrives into @entity120 on friday pride : the ship 's five - month aid mission to the @entity33 will have been one of its last for the @entity9 return : sailors disembarked on friday having not seen their partners , parents and children for five months ' she may be 30 years old but we believe there is a role in the world for her yet			1
we thought she would be fantastic as a luxury yacht , but also there is the idea to have her as a @entity10 aid ship			1
' she has just come back from the @entity33 , so maybe we can convince a charity or the @entity99 to invest in her to perform that role as well			2
' there is a lot of talk about what she could be used for , but no - one has put pen to paper to actually show what she could look like and how it might work			0
' we believe our design is a brave interpretation of such a distinguished vessel , stating boldly its new purpose , while paying respect to its impressive heritage			2
' @entity158 , yacht design director at @entity83 @entity82 , added : ' in recognising the importance of preserving such an iconic vessel , we came up with the idea of a " @entity10 " , where @entity0 could serve all nations of the @entity10 as a vehicle for promoting trade , attending international events , and undertaking humanitarian and disaster relief work around the globe			0
' known to her crew as @entity171 , the ship is the fifth @entity9 warship and second aircraft carrier to bear the name @entity0			0
reunited : @entity175 kisses her boyfriend @entity176 , one of those who served on the @entity33 mission joyous : petty officer @entity180 with his three - year - old son @entity181 at @entity120 emotional : thousands of friends and relatives witnessed one of the ship 's last returns to @entity32 welcome : the band of the @entity188 playing on friday			1
the invincible class of aircraft carriers will be replaced with two £ 6 billion vessels , which are due to enter service in 2020 entering service just after the @entity194 in 1982 , she helped to maintain the no - fly zone over @entity196 during the war there in the early 1990s			1
she was deployed to operate the no - fly zone in @entity200 during @entity201 in 1998 , and led the naval task force to @entity203 during that country 's civil war in 2000			1
various refits later , the government decided during the defence cuts in 2010 that @entity0 would be retired from service in 2014			0
other bids for the ship , which had to be finalised last month , exist from the cities of @entity32 and @entity212 to retain her as a heritage attraction			0
a spokesman for the @entity30 said : ' all interested parties needed to complete an industry day application form and return it to the @entity218 ( @entity218 ) by december 10			0
' for commercial reasons we can not discuss individual applications received by the @entity218			0
' a number of applications have been received and these are being assessed			0

vessel saw service in @entity196 , @entity200 , @entity203 and the @entity33
it will be axed this year following sister ships @entity44 and @entity45
designers claim it could double as floating conference centre and aid ship
three striking ' sails ' would rise above deck containing luxury restaurants
below deck could be a hospital , heavy - duty vehicles and vital equipment
design one of several received by @entity30 which says ship should avoid scrap
