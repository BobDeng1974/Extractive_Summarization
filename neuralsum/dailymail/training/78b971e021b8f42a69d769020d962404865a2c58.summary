by @entity0 for @entity1 holidaymakers could be paying as much as five times more for express airport transfers compared to the cheapest option available , according to a new study			0
the research looked at the fastest and cheapest transport options available to people travelling to and from 20 major @entity10 cities			2
for more than half of the airports , travellers are paying as much as five times more for services such as @entity15 and @entity16 - that were on average just a third slower than the cheaper public transport option			1
paying a premium : the @entity20 is 356 % more expensive than opting for public transport the study , by travel money specialist @entity22 worked out the prices and travel times for a single trip from the airport to the city centre			1
for people arriving at @entity15 , the @entity20 offers a speedy journey into central @entity31 in just 15 minutes			2
but a one - way ticket for two cost £ 52			2
the @entity33 takes four times as long but a couple will only pay £ 11.40 for tickets , so the express option costs an extra £ 40.60 or a premium of 356 per cent			1
both options are still cheaper than taking a taxi , unless you are travelling with four paying adults - in which case taking a cab would work out a much better value option than the @entity20			1
the biggest price discrepancy was found in @entity47			0
the arlanda express train from @entity49 to the city centre cuts down the transfer time by more than half compared to the cheapest option , a local bus , but the ticket price is 419 per cent more expensive			2
for visitors to @entity31 , taking the @entity20 or the underground work out cheaper than catching a cab the cheaper ( and slower ) option : taking the @entity33 in @entity31 to @entity15 will save travelling couples over £ 40 a couple will pay almost £ 45 for two single tickets for the 20 - minute journey , compared to just £ 9 on a local bus which takes 45 minutes			1
and travelling from the @entity66 airport to the city centre will pay around £ 30 for a taxi , which is £ 15 cheaper than taking the express train			2
the @entity70 from @entity72 's @entity71 , costs £ 22.26 for two , while the local bus costs just £ 6.36 - but take a good book , as it takes more than an hour			0
while from @entity77 , the airport express bus - £ 11.12 for two passengers - costs more than twice the local bus ( £ 4.76 ) , and the transfer time is only 22 per cent faster			1
the research revealed , that in 16 of the 20 @entity10 city airports surveyed , it is possible , if you take public transport , to transfer from the airport to the city centre for less than £ 10 for two people			1
in some cities , the cheapest option of getting to the airport was also the fastest option			0
a train from @entity93 costs £ 4.76 for two and takes just six minutes - compared to £ 22.11 for taking a taxi			0
in others , tourists will want to pay a premium for the ease , speed and stress - free travelling of the express airport service			0
@entity103 offers a 50 - minute train connection from @entity106 airport to @entity108 station for just £ 14.81 for two passengers			0
and while a local bus service offers the journey for less than £ 10 one - way , tourists do face a journey of two hours through a city notorious for its bad traffic			1
the train connection from @entity106 aiport to @entity108 station in @entity103 costs £ 14.81 for two people @entity119 , head of retail , @entity22 , said : ' there are so many transfer options available for travellers when they arrive at their destination airport that it can be difficult to know which one to choose			1
' the choice really comes down to whether you want to get to your city centre destination as quickly as possible or as cheaply as possible			0
' in some cases it is possible to achieve both , but our research reveals that those airports that offer a service operated by the airport itself , you will pay a considerable premium for the shorter transfer times			0
' it 's always worth checking out the transfer options from your destination airport before you travel , because you may find you can get discounted prices by booking in advance			0

faster transfers are on average only a third faster than cheaper options
a @entity20 ticket for two is £ 40.60 more than public transport
on average , a couple can transfer for less than £ 10 using public transport
