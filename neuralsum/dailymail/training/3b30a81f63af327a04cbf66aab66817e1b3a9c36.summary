by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 16:15 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 19:09 est , 17 april 2013 the @entity3 has voted down a bipartisan plan to expand background checks for gun buyers , rejecting the last viable gun control proposal put forward by president @entity8 after the @entity10 school massacre			1
the measure failed by a vote of 54 - 46 , six senators short of the 60 - vote hurdle needed for passage			1
a furious president @entity8 blasted the @entity3 shortly after the vote			1
he said it was shameful that a bill ' supported by 90 percent of @entity20 ' had failed			0
families of @entity10 victims , who had pushed for tougher gun laws , looked on as the @entity3 voted down the deal and stood with the @entity8 for his impassioned @entity26 speech			1
the amendment had been negotiated by @entity52 @entity51 of @entity53 and @entity55 @entity54 of @entity56			1
it was seen as @entity8 's best hope to pass meaningful gun - control legislation after the december massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in @entity10			1
@entity8 targeted much of his anger at the @entity64 , which lobbied hard against all of the proposed gun control legislation			1
' the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill , ' he said			0
' they claimed that it would create some kind of big brother gun registry			0
and unfortunately this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose because it upset an intense minority of gun owners			0
' there were no coherent arguments as to why they would n't do this			0
it came down to politics , the worry that a vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections			0
' support : families of the @entity10 school shooting stood by the president after the measure failed anger : @entity95 , whose daughter was shot at @entity97 , and @entity98 , who knocked a high - capacity magazine from the hand of shooter @entity101 as @entity103 , @entity35			1
president @entity8 claimed that ' 90 percent of @entity55 ' voted against the background check proposal and ' 90 percent of @entity105 supported it			2
' in fact , eight @entity107 crossed party lines on the vote			0
four republicans voted for the background check			0
four @entity105 voted against it			0
the measure failed by just six votes			0
republicans voting for amendment : @entity118 , @entity119 @entity120 , @entity121 @entity122 , @entity35 @entity54 , @entity56 ( sponsor ) @entity105 voting against amendment : @entity125 , @entity126 @entity127 , @entity128 @entity129 , @entity130 @entity131 , @entity132 he concluded by saying : ' all in all , it was a pretty shameful day in @entity134			1
' @entity135 erupted from the @entity3 gallery after the deal failed			2
' shame on you ! ' shouted @entity95 , whose daughter was shot at @entity97 , and @entity98 , who knocked a high - capacity magazine from the hand of shooter @entity101 during the @entity103 , @entity35 , massacre			1
' they are an embarrassment to this country , that they do n’t have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families , ' @entity144 shouted as she was removed from the @entity3 by officers			2
' opponents of the background check proposal hailed the bill 's defeat as a victory			0
a statement from the @entity64 restated the group 's position that the bill ' would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens , requiring lifelong friends , neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution			0
' @entity175 congressman @entity174 said that the defeat of the final gun control measure shows that @entity8 's political power has waned			1
' after spending over $ 1 billion to claw out a 51 % re-election , it ’s clear at this point @entity8 could n’t pass a stone , ' he said in a statement			0
staying active : @entity34 , who was shot in the head in january 2011 , has used her public profile to campaign for tougher gun laws since other measures backed by the @entity105 president - including a proposal to ban rapid - firing ' assault ' weapons like the one used in @entity192 and a limit on ammunition magazines - also are expected to fail as the @entity3 conducts nine consecutive votes on gun - control legislation			1
the votes are the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations and lobbying over @entity8 's proposed gun restrictions , and the defeat of the background checks amendment could doom the biggest package of gun legislation @entity206 has considered in two decades			1
opponents of the @entity51 - @entity54 plan and the restrictions on assault weapons said the proposals were an example of government overreach that would infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms			2
the @entity105 - led @entity3 also will consider several @entity55 - sponsored amendments backed by the @entity64 gun lobby that would expand gun rights , adding an element of uncertainty to the eventual content of the bill			2
the @entity3 legislation also includes tighter restrictions on gun trafficking and more funding for school security			2
the @entity51 - @entity54 background checks amendment allowed exemptions for private sales or gifts between families and friends and prohibited the creation of a national registry of guns			2
polls show more than 80 percent of @entity20 support expanded background checks .			0

@entity28 failed 54 - 46 , six votes short of the 60 needed to pass @entity3
families of @entity10 victims looked on as deal failed
amendment was negotiated by @entity53 *democrat* @entity51 and @entity56 @entity55 @entity54
hero of @entity103 shooting and mother of @entity97 victim shouted ' shame on you ' after vote
it was seen as @entity8 's last hope to win tougher gun control legislation
@entity8 blasted the @entity3 and said the vote marked ' a pretty shameful day in @entity134 '
