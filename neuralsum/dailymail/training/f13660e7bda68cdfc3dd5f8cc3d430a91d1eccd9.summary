there was a time when politicians would climb on to a soapbox to address voters , before they found comfort on the breakfast tv sofa			0
now the battle for swing voters has moved to the @entity10 panel , with the three main parties sending high - flying female mps onto the @entity14 show			1
it comes as polls show more than a third of women are yet to decide who to vote for on may 7			1
@entity21 minister @entity20 , @entity23 minister @entity22 and @entity25 frontbencher @entity24 will all join the @entity10 panel in the run - up to the election every party has prioritised wooing female voters , with around half of women believing politicians do not understand what life is like for them			1

@entity23 employment minister @entity22 and @entity25 ’s shadow women ’s minister @entity24 , both former tv presenters , will appear on the show			1
@entity21 business minister @entity20 will complete the line - up of politicians targeting daytime viewers			1
editor of loose women @entity43 said : “ @entity10 is the first show to start the election campaign			1
three of the youngest and most prolific female politicians will explain how they are making their mark and how they are working to feature in the future government			2
” they will appear with the regular line - up of straight - talking panel members including @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
miss @entity24 , who worked on @entity56 before entering politics , told @entity58 : ‘ @entity25 has some great policies for women and families and it will be great to be grilled about them by @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1

a poll this week showed women voters have put the @entity77 , living costs and family care pressures as their top concerns for the general election			0
some 59 per cent of women said they were concerned about the @entity77 , while 40 per cent of women identified living costs as a major issue and 30 per cent picked the cost of caring for their family - all of which were lower down on the list of priorities for male voters			0
the findings will provide a boost for @entity25 , which has put the health service and what it calls the cost of living crisis at the heart of its campaigning			2
according to the research by @entity103 for @entity105 's @entity104 , 31 per cent of men were concerned about the economy , including the deficit and unemployment , compared to just 21 per cent of women			2
