@entity6 could n't believe her luck when @entity9 flooring , normally retailing at $ 65 per case , was reduced to an incredible $ 2.97 per box on @entity13 's website			1
fearing she would miss out on the deal , @entity14 printed the ad and took it to a nearby outlet where she bought 22 boxes			2
opportunist : @entity6 took advantage of a pricing error on the @entity13 website to buy floorboards for her home at just $ 3 a square foot error : @entity6 ordered 72 boxes of hardwood from @entity13 which was incorrectly advertised for $ 2.97 per box instead of square foot she also paid for another 50 boxes at a different location to floor her 1500 square foot condo in @entity34 , @entity35			1
the proposal specialist paid just $ 213.84 for 72 boxes of hardwood			1
but @entity38 reported that when she went to pick up the flooring , @entity13 cancelled the order			2
the low , listed price was a mistake that should have read $ 2.97 per square foot - not box - which would have cost $ 4455			1

consumer experts say there is no law in @entity35 requiring that @entity13 honor the ad , as stores have a right to refuse a sale if there 's been a mistake .			1

@entity6 ordered and paid for 72 boxes of hardwood from @entity13 at $ 2.97 per case
the listed price was a mistake - it should have read $ 2.97 per square foot
the store refused to honor the deal until the media *intervened*
