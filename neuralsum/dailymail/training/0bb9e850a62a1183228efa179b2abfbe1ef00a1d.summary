@entity97 , who was shot three times , said : ' it could be ten or 15 years before he 's executed			0

@entity2 is accused of meticulously planning and brutally executing a plan to attack a @entity23 movie theater at midnight during a showing of the latest @entity112 movie , killing 12 people and injuring 70			1
defense lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that @entity2 would plead guilty if prosecutors allowed him to live out his days in prison with no chance of parole instead of having him put to death			1
that prompted an angry response from prosecutors , who called it an attempt to gin up public support for a plea deal			0
prosecutors also said the defense has repeatedly refused to give them the information they need to evaluate the plea agreement			0
april 1 : district attorney @entity64 arrives at district court for the hearing , left , and two women embrace after he announces they will seek the death penalty stalling : the former graduate student 's defense team said he was not ready to enter a plea so the judge entered one for him after effects : family members and victims arrive at district court for the arraignment of @entity2 , @entity35 theater shooting suspect , in @entity38 suspect : @entity2 is accused of killing 12 people at an @entity35 movie theater on july 20 if @entity2 is sentenced to prison , the state @entity147 would determine what kind of mental health care he gets , said @entity153 , a department spokeswoman			1
a third of the state 's inmates have moderate to severe mental illness , and the prison system has an extensive mental health division with a 250 - bed facility for the acutely mental ill , she said			0
inmates can be sent to the state mental hospital in @entity164 – where people found not guilty by reason of insanity are committed – but the stay is temporary , and they are returned to the prison system after treatment , she said			0
a plea bargain would bring finality to the case fairly early so victims and their families can avoid the prolonged trauma of not knowing what will happen , said @entity178 , a past president of the @entity179			2
‘ the defense , by making this public pleading , is reaching out to the victims ' families , ’ he said			0

he said the defense was n't ready despite previous delays — prompting prosecutors to object			0
if a jury agrees he is insane , @entity2 would be committed indefinitely to a state mental hospital			2
there would be a remote and unlikely chance he could be freed one day if doctors find his sanity has been restored			0
