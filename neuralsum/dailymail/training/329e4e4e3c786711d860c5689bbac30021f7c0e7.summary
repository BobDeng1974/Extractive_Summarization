by @entity1 reporter published : 20:57 est , 13 november 2013 @entity3 : 21:02 est , 13 november 2013 heart failure that kills thousands of @entity5 every year could be cured by a simple jab which shrinks the vital organ , according to a new study			1
scientists who have reversed the condition in animals by injecting them with a gene now hope tests on patients will be just as successful			2
they found the ‘ @entity16 ’ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts , improving their function and increasing blood flow			1
heart failure happens when the heart is unable to pump blood adequately			2
it affects over 750,000 people in the @entity25 - mainly the elderly - and claims 140,000 lives a year			1
the @entity27 gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts , improving their function and increasing blood flow			1
there are treatments but no cure			0
in the final experiments before human clinical trials @entity16 , a gene which is ' missing in action ' in heart failure patients , was delivered directly into the organ			1
dr @entity37 , who led the study , said : ' @entity16 gene therapy may be one of the first treatments that can actually shrink enlarged hearts and significantly improve a damaged heart ’s life - sustaining function			1
' we are very eager to test this gene therapy in our patients suffering from severe heart failure			1
' dr @entity37 is already on a path toward approval from the @entity51 in the @entity52 to test the revolutionary treatment on patients			0
it will be the second gene therapy treatment launched by he and his colleagues at @entity58 in @entity59			2
the first , named cupid , is in its final phases after successful tests on animals and substantial clinical improvements in patients			0
in that project , a gene known as @entity66 which produces an enzyme critical to the proper pumping of calcium out of cells , is injected via a harmless virus			0
in heart failure @entity66 is dysfunctional forcing the heart to work harder and in the process grow larger			0
the virus carrying @entity66 is delivered through the coronary arteries into the heart using tiny tubes			0
studies show only one dose is required to restore healthy production of the gene ’s beneficial enzyme			0
but a study by @entity85 and his researchers published two years ago showed @entity16 is also decreased in failing human hearts			1
the injection could reduce the need for invasive heart surgery , scientists hope dr @entity37 said : ' the key reason for this translational medicine speed is the outstanding infrastructure we have in the @entity97 at @entity58 where we are able to replicate human heart failure models to test our novel gene therapies			2
' i think this is a really very unique example of rapid translation of a promising medical therapy from an initial discovery to pre-clinical trials			0

researchers have successfully tested the injection on animals
the ‘ @entity16 ’ therapy shrinks bloated hearts , improving *circulation*
heart *disease* claims 140,000 *victims* every year
