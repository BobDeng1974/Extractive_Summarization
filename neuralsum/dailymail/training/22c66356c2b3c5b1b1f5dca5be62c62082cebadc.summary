@entity1 ' nightly newscast on @entity2 was beaten soundly in the ratings by @entity4 on friday , two days after @entity1 apologized for telling a false story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade in @entity8 12 years ago			1
the @entity10 company said that @entity4 's broadcast had 8.46 million viewers on friday , while @entity2 's @entity13 had just under 8 million			1
@entity1 anchored the newscast for @entity2			2
while it 's not unusual for @entity4 to win some individual days in the ratings , @entity2 has been consistently winning on a week - to - week basis			1
news of @entity1 ' @entity8 tale came out on wednesday of last week			1
on saturday @entity1 announced that he was temporarily stepping away from the @entity13 calling it ' painfully apparent ' that he had become a distracting news story			1
in a memo to @entity27 staff that was released by the network , the anchorman said that as managing editor of @entity13 he is taking himself off the broadcast for several days			1
weekend anchor @entity32 will fill in , @entity1 said			2
@entity27 has so far refused to comment on when or whether @entity1 would return and who would decide his future			2
@entity1 , however , said he would be back			2
' in the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news , it has become painfully apparent to me that i am presently too much a part of the news , due to my actions , ' @entity1 said in his memo			1
' upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us , ' he wrote			0
on the previous friday evening , @entity4 - hosted by @entity50 - had also won in the ratings by almost 400,000 viewers @entity27 president @entity52 said friday that an internal investigation had been launched after questions arose over @entity1 ' false on - air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket - propelled grenade while in @entity8 in 2003			1
@entity1 apologized for those statements wednesday			2
there was no indication by @entity1 , who has anchored @entity13 since 2004 , that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast friday			1
he signed off as he usually does , saying he hoped people would be back to see him monday			0
@entity32 did mention @entity1 ' leave in saturday 's newscast			1
' a word tonight about our colleague @entity1 , who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he 's covered , ' @entity32 said before reading @entity1 ' memo to viewers			1
since @entity1 ' apology , questions also have been raised about his claim that he saw a body or bodies in the @entity81 floodwaters that hit @entity82 in 2005			2
his remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in @entity82 ' @entity87 , the area where @entity1 was staying			0
a person at @entity2 confirmed that @entity1 stayed at the @entity89 , which is in an area where a news photographer and a law enforcement official said they saw bodies			2
@entity1 ' troubles began last month when he broadcast an item about meeting up with @entity97 sgt. major @entity98 , who the anchor had befriended in 2003 in @entity8 the effect on ' @entity13 ' remains to be seen			1
but even if its ratings suffer for a long period , it would n't be enough to damage the credit profile of parent @entity106 , said @entity108 , an analyst with @entity109			0
' @entity106 is a large , diverse media conglomerate with meaningful financial cushion to endure weakness in any one of its smaller divisions over a period of time , ' he said			0
other media companies have survived departures of on - air stars , @entity108 said			0
@entity118 , professor of communications and media studies at @entity120 , called @entity1 ' time off a good idea for him and @entity27			0
' it gives him a chance to catch his breath and , on a human level , it must be excruciating to get on the air and report the news and not say anything about this , ' @entity122 said			0
@entity27 , he said , ' wants to be in the business of reporting on the news , and not have people thinking , ' is he telling the truth ? '' weekend anchor @entity32 is currently filling in after @entity1 announced that he was temporarily stepping away from the @entity13 @entity135 , director of the graduate journalism program at @entity137 , also lauded @entity1 ' leave			1
it buys time for the network to assemble a contingency plan in the event it determines to suspend or remove him , @entity135 said			0
a final decision may await the finding of any ' collateral impact ' on another key @entity2 program , today , which would be evident when the february ratings numbers come out , he said			0
@entity13 has reigned as the top - rated evening newscast over its competition on @entity151 and @entity4			1
@entity1 ' importance to @entity27 goes beyond his anchor status , said @entity154 , a faculty member for broadcast and online at @entity157 , a journalism think tank			2
' he sets the tone of the network			0
it may not be as critical as when ( @entity164 ) @entity163 was @entity151 ' anchor , in every way , but he is more than a face , ' he said			0
@entity1 ' absence itself is a delicate challenge , according to @entity154			0
' he ca n't be gone long			0
the timing will be critical â€” too short and it wo n't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough , and too long and he looks like damaged goods , ' he said .			0
