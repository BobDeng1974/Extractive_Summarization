but in fact they depict a bizarre annual tradition in a @entity9 village which sees revellers taking control of the community and fighting a mock battle to impose their surreal regime			0
citizens of @entity18 , in the province of @entity16 , took to the streets today with flour , eggs and firecrackers in what must surely be one of the biggest food fights in the world			1
fight : two revellers taking part in the ' @entity29 ' festival in @entity18 in south - east @entity9 clash : the day is a fight between a group of married men and their rivals seeking to stop them taking over weapons : a member of ' @entity38 ' reviews his armoury in preparation for a counter-attack let rip : two men clash with the help of a whole box of eggs sent flying through the air the origins of the tradition are unclear - it is said to be over two centuries old , but in its current form it has been running only since 1981			1
the festival of ' @entity29 ' is held every year on december 28 , the @entity53 which is similar to @entity54 in @entity9 culture			2
it consists of two main groups who clash outside the town hall and cover the area in messy substances such as eggs and flour			0
aftermath : two participants covered in their warpaint and a hefty coating of flour following the festivities captive : one side drags away a prisoner during a heading moment in the good - natured mock battle @entity74 : a man takes a moment to relax as battle rages all around him @entity79 : the ' @entity29 ' group impose surreal new laws on the small town in @entity16 one group is the ' @entity29 ' , married men who assert control of the town and impose absurd laws on the citizens , fining anyone who disobeys them			1
in opposition is ' @entity38 ' , a group which represents the forces of law and order and attempts to defeat the new regime			0
emerging from the mist : the flurries of flour look almost like smoke curling across a battlefield going with a bang : the streets are filled with dangerous firecrackers as well as the food no mercy : participants clearly take the tradition , claimed to be over 200 years old , very seriously indeed throughout the course of the day , the town became increasingly chaotic as food and fireworks flew through the air and coated the streets			1
but at 5pm , normal order is restored as the community gathers together for a celebratory dance			0
the fines collected by the men throughout the day are donated to local charities			2
missile : the competitors dress up in military gear during the annual rampage outside the town hall spectacle : hundreds were gathered in @entity18 on friday to watch the madcap antics			2

citizens of @entity18 in @entity16 celebrate ' @entity29 ' on day of the *innocents*
@entity131 is said to be 200 years old *...* but can only be traced back to 1981
