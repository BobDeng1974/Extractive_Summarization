with their beautiful rock formations , crystal lined chambers and colourful landscapes , these are the secret caves that run for 40 miles under south @entity7			1
the images were captured by photographer @entity9 , who has extensively explored the @entity7 caves system , exploring places few have ventured to go			1

one of the underground caves below south @entity7 which have been captured on camera by photographer @entity9 the @entity17 cave , one of the longest in south @entity7 , which is also known as the @entity20 cave a caver stands underneath the rock formations of the @entity24 cave , which was first discovered by persistent digging in 1976 the part of the @entity28 cave known as the @entity29			1
this particular cave is known as a habitat for bats and now he is sharing his stunning images , which show the secret vast chambers and amazing natural mazes			0
mr @entity9 says he has been a caver all his life and was inspired to start taking pictures on his adventures to try and replicate the images he saw in caving guidebooks			2
but despite caving all over the @entity44 , the underground chambers of south @entity7 remain his favourite location , due to their largely unexplored nature			1
the main chamber of the @entity49 cave , which is known for its beautiful rock formation within it the @entity53 tunnel of the @entity55 cave , which is one of the most extensive and complex to explore in the whole system the unusual rock features in the @entity61 cave , which is one of the laegest cave systems in the country he told his flickr blog : ' last year on a visit to @entity68 we decided not to follow the main passage into the massive chambers that mark the end to the cave but to break off before this point and explore a rarely visited branch passage			0
' by avoiding the allure of the @entity77 at the end of the cave , we entered a smaller but stunningly beautiful passage , overlooked by virtually all cavers who are drawn to see the chambers at the end of the cave			0
' mr @entity9 adds that caving can be quite a safe pastime if all the proper precautions are taken and can be very rewarding as he gets to see largely hidden landscapes			0
a caver crawls through the narrow passages of the @entity92 cave , which has a number of dry passages the @entity96 waterfall below ground in the @entity99 cave , which is full of maze like passages a caver climbs up the slab squeeze in the @entity105 cave , one of the shorter chambers of the south @entity7 underground system he explained : ' many people imagine caving as lots of tight crawls and squeezes , thinking it could hold little attraction			1
' and if that was all there was , it would be very true â€” but beyond , lies open passages , deep pits , high vaulted chambers , and streams that meander through the hillside			0
' the challenge is to find the route , overcome the obstacles , and follow the passages deep into the mountains to reveal the secrets held within			0
