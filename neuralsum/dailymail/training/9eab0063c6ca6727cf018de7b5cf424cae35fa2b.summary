two brothers have become the first @entity2 children to be fitted with the ‘ injectable ’ heart rate monitors , using smartphone technology to transmit information about their heartbeat to doctors			1
eight - year - old @entity8 and @entity9 , seven , were each implanted with a tiny device called a @entity11 on @entity12			1
the miniature heart rate monitors record the rhythm of their heart 24 hours a day			1
success : @entity9 and @entity8 from @entity17 , the first to have a procedure in the @entity2 to implant a new type of monitor as they are suspected to have heart conditions in a procedure which took just minutes , under general anaesthetic , their surgeon made a shallow 5mm incision in each boy ’s chest , above the heart			1
the devices were inserted just under the skin using a specially designed plunger			2
the technique used is similar to the microchipping of horses and dogs , and the resulting wound is so small it can be glued afterwards , rather than stitched			2
the hope is that the device will be a boon for the millions of @entity2 who suffer difficult - to - diagnose , life - threatening heart rate disturbances , known as arrhythmia			1
doctors at @entity46 decided to fit the brothers with the device to determine whether they have inherited a potentially fatal heart condition from their mother			1
the state - of - the - art titanium devices , which cost £ 1,500 each and have a battery life of three years , look like a computer memory stick and are the size of two matchsticks			2
two tiny electrodes within them pick up the electrical pattern of the heart rate and detect any irregularities in the same method as a standard @entity61			1
@entity62 data is sent wirelessly to portable base stations in the boys ’ home in @entity17			2
it uses a 3g signal to automatically pass that data on to medical professionals in hospital who analyse the information for abnormalities every day			1
each brother has his own base station			2
as soon as the boys come within three metres , the base station will download that day ’s data so there is no need for them to take the machine to school			2
they will only have to take the base stations along if they go on holiday or spend long periods away from home			2
‘ in the past we would have missed symptoms which these devices will now be able to pick up , ’ says consultant cardiologist dr @entity87 , who fitted the devices			1
‘ we used to rely on cumbersome portable echocardiograms [ @entity61 ] , a scanning device that allows us to monitor heart rate for the time that it is attached to the patient			1
they are about the size of an @entity99 and come with wires which are taped to the chest and can monitor the heart for a few hours to a week			1
‘ but the chances of picking up something while the @entity61 was on was always slim , due to the unpredictable nature of symptoms			0
we tried this option with both boys but unsurprisingly they offered no conclusive results			0
’ early precursors to the injectable monitor have been in use since the late 1990s			1
like the @entity11 , they were fitted under the skin but did n’t monitor information automatically , working only if the patient set it to record after an episode			1
the devices were about seven times the size and had no way of wirelessly transmitting data			0
‘ we used them in children but they were quite unsightly and much more painful to fit and we used them much less as a result , although we probably would have had to use them in this case , ’ says dr @entity87			0
doctors had already determined that @entity8 has inherited @entity130 from his mother			1
this is a rare heart condition that can cause fainting and arrhythmia , and if untreated , can be fatal			2
a standard @entity61 identified @entity8 ’s condition			1
but doctors wanted to find out whether this was also the case for @entity9 , whose @entity61 results were inconclusive but who recently collapsed at home			0
they also wanted to find out whether the medication @entity8 was being given was adequate			1
‘ the difficulty with treatment for this sort of condition is that we only know it ’s working when nothing happens , ’ says dr @entity87			0
‘ if something does happen , like a collapse , then it can be difficult to determine the cause without having captured it on an @entity61			0
installing these heart rate monitors means we are guaranteed to pick it up the next time one of the boys has a problem			1
’ the name ‘ @entity130 ’ refers to an abnormally long gap between the @entity162 and t waves as measured by an @entity61 , meaning it takes longer for the heart cells in the ventricles to recharge after each heartbeat			2
children with a parent who has the condition have a 50 per cent of chance of inheriting it themselves			0
patients tend to be prescribed beta - blockers , which help to slow down and stabilise the heart rhythm			2
if this is unsuccessful , a defibrillator can be fitted which delivers an electric shock to the heart if it stops			1
‘ fitting a defibrillator is a big step for young patients , which is why it ’s so important to be certain they actually need one , ’ says dr @entity87			0
the boys ’ mother @entity184 , 34 , who is successfully managing her condition with beta - blockers , says fitting them with heart rate monitors came as a great relief			1
‘ it puts my mind at rest to know they are going to be monitored 24/7 , ’ says the stay - at - home mum			0
‘ it ’s reassuring to know the doctors will be alerted straight away to any abnormalities			0
’ @entity184 was only diagnosed with @entity130 herself last may when she was sent for an @entity61 after going to see her gp about what she thought was heartburn			0
‘ they told me my children had a 50/50 chance of inheriting it , which was a shock and really hard to come to terms with			0
they are very outgoing , cheeky boys			0
they ’re active and live normal lives			0
they love basketball and their scooters , they never stop			0
but i ’m very protective of them now and like to have them with me all the time			0
when they ’re at school , i ’m terrified of getting a call to say one of them has collapsed			0
‘ i was n’t worried at all about the surgery as i knew they were in safe hands and dr @entity87 had reassured me it ’s a very safe procedure			0
‘ the boys came home the same evening and were bouncing around and back to their normal selves within the hour , ’ she adds .			0
