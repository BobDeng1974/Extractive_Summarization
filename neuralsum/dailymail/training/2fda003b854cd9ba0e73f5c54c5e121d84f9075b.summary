it was @entity2 's most expensive penthouse , a high - rise paradise with its own pool , luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque that sold off the plan in 2006 for almost $ 17 million			1
now , it 's an empty shell after a deal to sell to one of @entity2 's richest men fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute			1
and the massive four - floor apartment has been stripped of every piece of furniture , every fitting , the walls ceiling - and yes , even the kitchen sink - in an effort to attract a new buyer who can stamp their personality on the @entity24 property			1
' @entity26 ' on the glitzy @entity24 is ready to get a glamorous makeover again , after being stripped bare			1
just about every mod - con is long gone ahead of the international auction planned for next month			1
if you have the cash , here 's your chance to start form the ground up , high above the ground			2
@entity37 selling agent @entity36 says the ' blank canvas ' is the new appeal of this four - level 1,040 square metre property			0
' it is very , very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want , particularly here on the @entity24 , ' he told @entity48			1
the living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance , all fittings and furnishings have been removed , even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the @entity24 , though , is still the same the previous fit - out is long gone as the @entity26 prepares to go under the hammer the @entity26 is one of the stand - out buildings along the @entity24 skyline he and co-partner @entity61 were brought in , with a clear brief , take whatever measures are needed to sell it			1
they took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $ 16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit - out ' look , we had to admit that it ( the fit - out ) that was there was not very appealing , so we decided that it needed to be ripped up			1
' yesterday : ' there 's not much left from how we found it , ' @entity36 admitted			0
the interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting a big buyer 's personal touch today : the bare bones living area			1
' it 's unique , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse , so we began by stripping it right back to a shell , that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too ' mr @entity36 of selling agents @entity97 told @entity48 ' it 's unique , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse , so we began by stripping it right back to a shell , that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too , ' mr @entity36 added			1
the @entity26 starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels			2
' there 's not much left from how we found it , ' he said			0
mr @entity36 said that the auction , will be held for receivers pricewaterhousecoopers and is set to happen march 7			1
' there has been plenty of local and international interest			0
' all cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the ' old @entity117 '			0
it 's been gutted after the $ 17 million sale fell through			2
the stripped version goes under the hammer in march			0
now the appeal is that buyers will have a ' blank canvas ' to work with @entity37 selling agent @entity36			0
he says the new appeal of this four - level 1040 square metre property ' is that it is very , very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want , particularly here on the @entity24 ' development company @entity135 has been locked in a bitter legal battle with one of @entity2 's richest men , @entity139 , who is believed to have agreed to purchase the property in 2006 for the then record price of $ 16.85million			1
that agreement to purchase expired last year and the group has sought to keep the $ 1.685 million deposit along with a further $ 3.8 million in interest plus damages			2
mr @entity139 , however , is fighting the claims , alleging misrepresentation			0
the luxurious pool - side look ( above ) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners			0
the current version ( below ) shows @entity156 's highest positioned pool and spa , but little else as it is now			0
the luxurious pool - side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners			0
the current version shows @entity156 's highest positioned pool and spa , but little else ' this is the first time i can remember where a penthouse like this is available , be it on the ( @entity168 ) @entity24 or not , where buyers can start with a blank canvas in an already complete and amazing building , ' said mr @entity36			1
it may well have been stripped back - but the penthouse has plenty of appeal , he said			2
that includes : it 's position at more than 220 metres above the ground , four levels ( 70 - 73 ) , boasting ' the highest swimming pool and spa in @entity156 ' , no less than eight secure basement car spaces ( which have also had fittings removed ) and ' full resort facilities including pools , gym and gardens '			1
' this will give them ( buyers ) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in @entity2 , and create a residence of world - class standing			2
at least the bbq is still in place			0
one of the biggest talking points all along for the @entity26 has been the swimming pool and spa area , the highest of their kind anywhere in @entity156 eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area has been cleared out ahead of the auction ' you have spectacular views - out to the @entity211 to the west , you look east out to the ocean , then up to @entity214 ( @entity215 ) in the north and all the way down to @entity218 down south , to be fair the previous lay - out did not do that justice			2
' the successful bidders will get plenty of input on how to do justice to the prime position			0
' the three parties we 've commissioned have worldwide experience in working with buyers who own iconic locations , ' said mr @entity61 in reference to firms @entity232 ( the original designer ) , @entity234 and @entity235			0
these groups have been brought in to come up with alternative lay - outs for potential buyers , he said			0
' the three companies have provided us with their vision for the penthouse 's future look			0
' you look up to @entity214 ( @entity215 ) and all the way down to @entity218 down south , to be fair the previous lay - out did not do that justice ' said mr @entity36 with views like this , it 's little wonder mr @entity251 claims ' there has been plenty of local and international interest ' about @entity117 - the @entity26 on the @entity24 which has been stripped bare ahead of its auction next month			1

@entity26 set a record as the country 's most expensive penthouse when sold for $ 16.85m in 2006
but planned sale to one of @entity2 's richest collapsed last year , and receivers were brought in after a legal dispute
apartment on floors 70 - *74* of a @entity24 high - rise has been stripped of all fittings - walls , ceilings , even the kitchen sink
agents say the bare - bones shell is a ' unique opportunity ' for anyone wanting to put their own touch on a penthouse
an international auction will be held next month
