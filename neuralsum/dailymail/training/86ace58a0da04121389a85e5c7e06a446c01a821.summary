but museum curators have made an appeal for members of the public to contribute their old @entity12 models and kits after an exhibition due to open at the @entity16 museum has been left with gaps			1
the exhibition , which is due to open in june , will document the history of @entity12 dating back to its advent in 1939			1
curators are appealing for members of the public to contribute their @entity12 models to complete the exhibition kits still in their boxes are also being sought to be included in the @entity29 exhibition , which opens in june but the museum has a shortage of certain types of @entity12 toys from the 1950s and 1960s which it is hoped members of the public can fill by donating their models , either fully built or still in boxes			1
the missing items in particular include the first @entity40 , the first @entity41 , the @entity42 and a @entity43			1
also sought after are figures from the historical characters range , including @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 the company was launched in 1939 by @entity52 @entity51			0
the small - scale @entity54 model first went on sale in @entity56 in 1952			0
the first spitfire - one of the company 's most popular models - went on sale in 1953			2
during the 1970s @entity12 was selling 20 million kits a year			1
in the 1980s the toys began to decline and the firm was bought by @entity64 , who later sold it to @entity67			2
in 1995 @entity12 was sold to @entity68 and in 2006 it was bought by trainset toy company , @entity70			1
curators are mainly looking for perfectly built items in mint condition , but are also seeking one or two more clumsy attempts to feature in the collection			2
@entity77 , the curator of the exhibition , told the @entity79 : ' it would be interesting to get a few examples of models made by eight - year - olds who were shockingly proud of them , but which were actually dreadful			0
' we would like to make a feature of some for the huge enjoyment people got from making their own toy			0
anything and everything is of interest			0
' the company is assisting in the search , but as the ownership has changed many times over the years there are gaps in some of the ranges needed for the exhibition			2
appeals have been made in vain to model clubs but the curators are hoping members of the public will be able to fill the void .			0

gaps remain in museum @entity12 collection from 1950s and 1960s
