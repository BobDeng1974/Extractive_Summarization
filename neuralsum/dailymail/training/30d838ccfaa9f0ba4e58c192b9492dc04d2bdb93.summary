families should only be able to claim child benefit for their first two offspring , @entity0 said yesterday			1
a cap on the handouts would mean parents missing out on almost £ 700 a year if they have a third baby , according to plans backed by the @entity9			1
his approval sparked a new @entity12 row with deputy prime minister @entity13 condemning the ' @entity15 - style ' state interference in parenting			1
conflict : pensions secretary @entity0 , right , has said families should only be able to claim for their first two offspring			2
@entity13 , left , compared proposals to a ' @entity15 - style ' crackdown discussing the two - child limit , mr @entity0 declared in an interview with the @entity23 yesterday : ‘ it ’s a brilliant idea			1
’ the plan , expected to slash £ 5 billion from the benefits bill , is being studied as a key policy for the @entity29 election manifesto in 2015			1
but deputy prime minister @entity13 yesterday said it would penalise the young and dismissed it as a ‘ @entity15 - style ’ crackdown – a reference to the single - child policy imposed by @entity35 since 1979			1
@entity37 parents currently get £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for each subsequent child			1
but under the changes , parents who currently claim because their annual income is less than £ 50,000 would lose out on £ 696 a year			2
the reform would only apply to those who have a third baby after the measure is introduced			0
a source close to mr @entity0 said he backs the idea proposed by a member of @entity50 ’s policy board – in part because it would force parents on benefits to consider whether they could afford children , rather than expecting taxpayers to pick up the tab			1
the @entity9 proposed a new raft of welfare reforms last night , with the aim of cracking down on benefits tourism , getting people into work and cutting the welfare bill			2
mr @entity0 said that migrants from the @entity65 should be banned from claiming welfare until they have been in the @entity37 for two years to stop them exploiting the system			2
he said that allies in @entity70 , @entity71 , the @entity72 and @entity73 supported his idea , and could help him change @entity65 law			2
the cabinet minister , speaking to the @entity23 , also suggested changes for @entity37 citizens , including the cap on child benefits , and removing housing benefits for young people			2
he said that removing housing benefit for under - 25s could be ' a massive money - saver ' as it would encourage them to seek work rather than living in state - funded accommodation			0
but he also made clear that he wanted the lowest - paid to get higher wages - perhaps by increasing the minimum wage			0
he said the move would help save money currently spent on tax credits			0
he said : ‘ @entity0 has sympathised with this idea for some time			1
he thinks it ’s a serious money saver			0
and he believes that people on benefits should have to make the same choices as other people normally do			0
it is slightly infantilising unless you make people make those choices themselves			0
’ mr @entity0 also supported cuts in housing benefit for the under - 25s , saying it would get young people into work first rather than putting them into a flat paid for by welfare			1
‘ it is very difficult for them to take a job because they could lose their housing benefit and then they may lose their flat , ’ he said			0
the minister ’s intervention is significant since it comes after @entity120 slapped down @entity29 mp @entity121 , a member of mr @entity50 ’s no 10 policy board , after he revealed that the party was considering the child benefit policy			1
the minister ’s approval comes after chancellor @entity127 announced plans to slash £ 12 billion from the welfare budget by 2018 as he seeks to eliminate the budget deficit with spending cuts alone			1
but @entity13 made clear that he wants child benefits left alone			0
he told the @entity134 @entity133 : ‘ i will look at all proposals but some of the ones i have seen floated ... for instance , the idea of a two - child policy – i am not in favour of penalising the young			1
‘ i am not in favour of a sort of @entity15 - style family policy saying the state says it is ok to have two children , it is not ok to have three children			0
‘ remember this is child benefit that goes to families , many of whom are working			2
they are working very hard , often on low incomes			0
‘ my priority is a fair approach to ongoing fiscal consolidation			0
if you have to balance the books you must n’t balance the books only on the working - age poor			0
we are , indeed , in it all together and that ’s why everyone should make a contribution			0

@entity166 would mean parents would miss out on £ 700 if they had third child
*controversial* idea would slash £ *5billion* from benefit bill , it is thought
@entity0 claimed it would be a ' brilliant idea ' yesterday , sparking @entity12 row
plan being studied as key policy for @entity29 manifesto 2015
