by @entity0 last updated at 9:40 am on 7th december 2011 a 19 - year - old man has filed a complaint with state police alleging he was sexually abused by @entity6 after the former coach gave him liquor on the @entity10 campus in 2004 , the accuser 's lawyer said tuesday			1
@entity11 said the client , whom he did not identify , went to his law firm about three weeks ago , after @entity6 was charged with sexually abusing eight boys over a 15 - year period			1
' he suffered one incident of abuse , to use the legal term - involuntary deviate sexual intercourse - allegedly at the hands of mr @entity6 , ' mr @entity11 said			1
' that occurred on the @entity10 campus , we believe in the area of the football facilities			1
' newest complaint : a 19 - year - old man stepped forward to accuse @entity6 ( centre ) of sexual abuse			1
he is the ninth to do so @entity6 's lawyer , @entity30 , said he was unfamiliar with the allegations mr @entity11 was making			1
the new claim came the day a lawyer for another young man who accused @entity6 of sexual abuse said he expects his client and at least five other accusers to testify at a preliminary hearing next week			1
the lawyer said he has information that the six young men whose testimony before a grand jury contributed to a report detailing allegations against @entity6 will be called to testify next tuesday			1
@entity6 is charged with 40 counts of child sex abuse , and prosecutors allege he met his victims through a charity he founded in 1977 to help at - risk children , @entity50			1
@entity6 , 67 , denies being a paedophile and has vowed to fight the charges			2
in interviews with @entity55 and the @entity56 , he has said he showered and horsed around with boys but never sexually abused them			0
the existence of mr @entity11 's client was first reported by @entity60 in @entity61			0
mr @entity11 told the @entity0 that his client was 12 years old , dealing with the death of his mother and suffering emotional issues at the time of the campus incident			2
the lawyer said the two met through @entity50 and his client claims @entity6 gave him liquor while in the office on campus			1
the grand jury report did not allege any instances of @entity6 giving boys alcohol			2
@entity11 said his law firm is conducting its own investigation into the client 's claims			0
accused : @entity6 faces 40 counts of sexually abusing minors ' we hope to have it wrapped up within another week			2
we believe him to be credible , ' mr @entity11 said			0
' everything that we 've been able to unearth since has corroborated what he told us , but we 'll continue to do our due diligence			0
' the preliminary hearing , at which a judge would determine if prosecutors have enough evidence to take the case to trial , could last a day or more since the defence has the right to cross-examine the state 's witnesses			2
the state attorney general 's office would not comment on the evidence authorities plan to offer to show probable cause the crimes occurred			0
mr @entity30 said tuesday that a police officer witness should not be able to testify in the place of the accusers , based on evidentiary rules that pertain to hearsay			2
no familiarity : @entity6 's lawyer @entity30 ( left ) said he was unfamiliar with the newest allegations ' our position would be that these people have to testify , ' mr @entity30 said			1
' and one is n't sufficient , because you have eight separate incidents ... with eight separate alleged victims or accusers			0
' prosecutors listed eight victims in the grand jury report but did n't know the identities of two of them when they issued the report in early november			0
the report said one of those two was a boy seen being sodomized by @entity6 in a @entity10 football complex shower in 2002			1
mr @entity30 has said he believes he knows the identity of the boy in the shower and that the person dined with @entity6 this past @entity131 said he 's looking forward to questioning the prosecution witnesses - including any accusers			1
horsing around : @entity6 denies being a paedophile			2
he has said he showered and horsed around with boys but never sexually abused them ' we will , for the very first time , have the opportunity to face @entity6 's accusers and question them under oath about their allegations , ' he said in a statement monday			1
' we look forward to this opportunity			0
' former sex crimes prosecutor @entity143 said prosecutors may have to call the six known accusers for the judge to uphold the 40 counts			0
defence lawyers sometimes waive preliminary hearings if they are worried about publicity for their clients , but mr @entity143 said he is not surprised mr @entity30 is demanding the hearing			0
' this is their first and only opportunity before trial to actually see the witnesses ... to hear their tone and demeanour and to question them and see how they respond to questions and also to flush out details , ' said @entity143 , who is now a criminal defence lawyer in @entity161			0
assistant football coach @entity162 , who has been identified as the witness to the 2002 shower encounter , could also be called to testify			2
mr @entity162 's account was n't immediately brought to the attention of authorities even though high - level people at @entity10 apparently were told about an incident in the showers			1
full cooperation : @entity10 president @entity172 ( far left ) pledged that investigators will have unfettered access to the school in the wake of the scandal , the university last month fired coach @entity179 and accepted president @entity181 's resignation			1
@entity179 has said he wishes he had done more about allegations against @entity6			2
athletic director @entity183 has been placed on administrative leave , and vice president @entity185 , who was in charge of the university 's police department , has stepped down			0
@entity189 and @entity183 are charged with lying to the grand jury and failure to report to police			0
also tuesday , @entity10 president @entity172 told sceptical faculty members not to worry that school trustees would ' whitewash ' their own investigation			0
mr @entity172 pledged to the @entity199 that investigators will have unfettered access to and cooperation from the school			0
he said the leadership of a committee checking into the allegations should lend confidence ' that there will be no whitewash ... no sweeping under the rug			0

@entity212 , now 19 , said he was abused at 12 in 2004 by @entity6 on @entity10 's campus
comes day after lawyer for another victim said all six identified accusers expected to testify
