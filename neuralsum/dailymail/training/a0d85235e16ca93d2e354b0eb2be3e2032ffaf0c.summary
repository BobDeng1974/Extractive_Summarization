@entity0 took a thinly veiled swipe at two of his biggest title rivals — @entity4 and @entity5 — ahead of the first day of the @entity7 season			1
the @entity9 manager failed to win any trophies in his first season back at the club last year , while @entity13 ended nine years without silverware at @entity5 by winning the @entity15			1
when asked if he felt under pressure to deliver , @entity0 replied : ‘ why ? some managers have 10 years to win something			1
’ @entity4 ’s @entity19 won the @entity7 and @entity20 double last year with a squad inherited from @entity22			1
under the @entity24 they won the title , the @entity15 and the @entity26			1
@entity0 added : ‘ i do n’t like to get clubs developed by other managers before me , i do n’t like to arrive on time to collect the fruit off their trees			1
i do n’t like easy jobs			2
’ on the attack : @entity9 boss @entity0 took a thinly veiled swipe at two of his biggest title rivals content : @entity0 does n't feel under pressure despite failing to win a trophy last season upbeat : after talking down their chances last season , @entity0 admits @entity9 are now title contenders last season , @entity0 branded @entity13 a ‘ specialist in failure ’ and rowed with @entity19 about which clubs had spent the most money			1
the @entity51 considers that he has been in the process of building his own squad at @entity54 , not using the one handed down by @entity56			1
this summer @entity9 have brought in @entity57 for £ 32million and spent £ 16m on @entity58 , both from @entity59 , signed @entity60 from @entity61 for £ 30m and added @entity62 on a free transfer			2
in total he has brought in 11 other players on permanent deals and spent close to £ 200m since he arrived in 2013			2
‘ at the end of the season you , the supporters and the players will judge my work			2
and most importantly my boss , my owner , my board will judge			2
’ after talking down their chances last season , @entity0 , who starts his campaign against newly - promoted @entity84 on monday , admits @entity9 are title contenders			1
but he claims some managers are given an easier ride than others when it comes to rating success			0
‘ you do n’t look with the same eyes on different people , do n’t measure people by the same dimensions , ’ he explained			0
‘ for some to reach success is to achieve this and for others to achieve success is to achieve that			0
because of my last 10 years and @entity9 ’s last 10 years i understand why you always put the level high for myself and @entity9			2
‘ i really do n’t care about it			0
i just care about being myself , to work hard every day , to have ambition to win the next game , it does n’t matter which competition or which opponent			0
i want to win against @entity84 , that ’s the first step			0
’ in charge : @entity0 oversees a training session at @entity9 's @entity115 training ground on friday wait : @entity0 's @entity9 will begin their @entity7 campaign at @entity84 on monday night splash the cash : the @entity9 boss has brought in the likes of @entity57 , @entity60 and @entity120 perhaps the toughest decision @entity0 faced ahead of this new campaign was who to pick as his no 1 goalkeeper : @entity125 , who has spent three seasons on loan at @entity59 , or @entity128 , who has made the position his own since he joined the club in june 2004 , a day before @entity0 was announced as manager for his first spell			1
@entity0 considers both to be in the top three goalkeepers in the world			1
he appears to believe the 22 - year - old @entity135 is finally ready to take over the mantle from @entity128 , a decade his senior			0
but @entity0 will not disrespect @entity128 by playing him with second - string sides in games of less importance and suggests there is a still a role for him to play at the club			1
‘ i must support the keeper who is not first choice , ’ he said			0
‘ supporting him is not to give him a @entity20 game			2
it is to show him my trust when no one is expecting that he plays			0
i did that with @entity128 and @entity150			0
i played @entity150 against @entity151 in the @entity152 in the first game of the group , not in the sixth when we had already qualified			0
‘ i also played him in one league match when we were not champions , not after being champions			0
the best way to show a player you trust him is to play him when no one expects it and in games where there are responsibilities			0
with these two i can do that			0
