by @entity0 a mother who can not smile due to a rare condition has refused corrective surgery - because she wants her children to appreciate different faces			1
@entity6 , 33 , has @entity8 syndrome , a rare neurological condition which paralyses facial muscles , meaning she has never been able to smile at her children			1
it has also left her unable to blink or look left and right			1
@entity6 , 33 , turned down surgery to allow her to smile because she wanted her children to learn that people should not feel they need surgery just because they look different			1
she is pictured with her son , @entity15 when asked by her seven - year - old son why she had never smiled at him , she explained that her face does n’t work like his			2
now , she has turned down the chance of surgery to enable her to smile because she wants to show her children how important it is to accept differences			1
instead , she has developed other ways to show them how happy they make her			0
ms @entity6 , from @entity23 , said : ‘ this is me , i am who i am and i want my children to accept differences			1
‘ i might not be able to smile on the outside but i am always smiling on the inside			1
i make sure my children know how happy they make me every day			2
i do n’t need a smile on my face to do that			2
' a real smile comes from the heart			2
’ ms @entity6 ( pictured with her son , @entity15 ) was born with @entity8 syndrome which causes facial paralysis mrs @entity6 ( pictured , left , as a teenager and , right , with her son , @entity15 ) was born with the condition but says she was not aware of it until she was 10 she added : ‘ a lot of people stare at me			1
i ’m pretty sure they must think i ’m miserable all the time but that could not be further from the truth			0
‘ even i do n’t recognise the face in the mirror because it does n’t reflect how i feel inside at all			2
’ moebius syndrome is a rare neurological condition that affects the muscles that control facial expressions and eye movement			1

they often also have a small chin and mouth and a short tongue			0
dental abnormalities are also common in people with the syndrome			1

source : @entity88 ms @entity6 was diagnosed with the condition when she was six months old after struggling to suck from a bottle			1
her parents were warned then she would never be able to smile			0
but she did n’t become aware of her condition until she was ten			0
she said : ‘ my parents took me to a conference about it and explained i was different			0
i had n’t really notice myself at that point			0
’ but all that changed at high school when ms @entity6 was bullied			2
she said : ‘ that was the first time i ever wished i could smile			0
‘ the condition also means i ca n’t control my mouth so it hangs open and i was called awful names - like fish face			0
’ she was relieved when she fell pregnant in 2007 with her son @entity15 and doctors confirmed it was unlikely he would have the condition			0
but it was at moments like his birth that ms @entity112 wished she could smile to show her joy			0
instead she developed other ways , like using the tone of her voice , to express happiness to him and daughter @entity119 , nine months			0
ms @entity6 says she did consider surgery to remove a tendon from her shoulder , which could be used to help create a smile , but ruled it out for the sake of her little ones			1
she said : ‘ as lovely as it would be to be able to smile at them , i did n’t want my children to think it is necessary to have surgery to look the same as others			1
‘ we are all different in one way or another and that is nothing to be ashamed of			0
‘ i ’m delighted for people who do have the surgery , but it just was n’t for me			2
’ ms @entity6 could have had surgery to move a tendon from her shoulder in to her face to allow her to smile but she decided that it was not for her ms @entity6 ( pictured with her baby daughter and friend , @entity147 ) says she is always smiling on the inside and that she hopes people realise how happy she is despite her lack of facial expressions ms @entity6 held an awareness day earlier this year to help people understand she is n’t glum and to raise awareness of her condition			1
she said : ‘ i did n’t want to get into the situation of approaching people who are staring at me because that is n’t me , but i wanted to get the message out there			0
‘ i may not be smiling but i am certainly one very happy mummy			0
