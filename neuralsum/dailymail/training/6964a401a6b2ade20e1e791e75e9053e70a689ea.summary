it was an incredible saturday of bad tackles , red cards and dives			2
here i cast my eye over a host of controversial incidents and give my verdict on whether the men in black got their decisions right or wrong ... @entity13 v @entity11 @entity14 had a tough afternoon at @entity15 where the attitude and approach of both teams made decisions hard and all the more difficult when so many players surrounded him and pressured him to send opponents off			1
the @entity22 must look at this and charge @entity11 with failing to control their players - whatever the provocation or sense of injustice , this can not be allowed to go without sanction			1
foul by @entity31 on @entity32 in the centre circle which was not given , and @entity13 scored the first after gaining possession			1
verdict : wrong @entity13 's @entity31 ( right ) should have been penalised for fouling @entity11 's @entity32 @entity36 scored @entity13 's first goal following @entity31 's foul on @entity32 , which was not given @entity40 dives and is correctly cautioned for simulation			1
verdict : right @entity14 ( right ) booked @entity13 's @entity40 for diving against @entity11 at @entity15 on saturday @entity40 ( left ) goes down under a challenge from @entity44 , who tried to pull away from it the @entity47 midfielder goes to ground theatrically at @entity15 , however @entity14 did not buy the dive and rightly booked @entity40 for simulation against @entity11 @entity51 goes over the top of the ball with an outstretched boot , studs showing and catches @entity32			1
the @entity13 defender was cautioned but should have been sent off			1
verdict : wrong @entity13 defender @entity51 goes through @entity11 's @entity32 in this challenge that landed him a booking @entity11 's @entity59 and @entity60 wanted more serious punishment for the foul by @entity51 @entity51 bursts into the penalty area and dives between two @entity11 defenders , both of whom pull out of challenge			1
verdict : wrong @entity51 ( obscured , centre ) goes down theatrically in the box for @entity13 against @entity11 the @entity13 centre back ( left ) looks on in shock at @entity60 ( right ) tells him to get up referee @entity14 ( second right ) points for a goal kick and wrongly failed to produce a second yellow for @entity51 @entity74 goes into a challenge at pace and while he wins the ball the speed of the tackle makes it dangerous and he is cautioned			1
verdict : right @entity74 ( right ) was booked by @entity14 for going into a challenge which had too much pace to it @entity60 dangles a leg out to challenge @entity85 who dives over the leg			1
had the @entity89 striker continued the run he would have been fouled and possibly injured			0
while many would disagree i thought it was a foul but @entity14 cautioned for diving			0
verdict : wrong @entity85 ( right ) was booked for simulation after a challenge on him from @entity60 @entity14 ( centre ) brandishes a yellow card to @entity85 , wrongly , after believing he dived during the match @entity60 commits a horrible over-the - top tackle leaving @entity14 with a simple decision to send him off			1
verdict : right @entity60 ( right ) was correctly sent off for an over-the - top challenge against @entity13 @entity105 v @entity103 @entity106 had a relatively quiet afternoon but still managed a couple of strange decisions			1
@entity109 went in very high , leading with studs on @entity111 with a very poor challenge , and should have been sent off			0
verdict : wrong @entity109 ( right ) should have been sent off for @entity103 after a challenge on @entity111 ( left ) @entity114 danced through the @entity103 defence and scored a lovely goal but @entity106 pulled play back and awarded a free kick to the @entity118 for a foul by @entity114 on @entity120			2
verdict : wrong @entity105 's @entity114 should not have been penalised for pulling back @entity103 's @entity120 @entity121 certainly fouled @entity114 for the @entity105 penalty			2
verdict : right @entity121 ( left ) was rightly penalised for pulling down @entity114 in the box on saturday @entity125 v @entity124 @entity126 also had two stand - out decisions to make and could not have been in better positions to judge			1
there was a collision between @entity125 ’s @entity131 and @entity132 in the first half			0
both players went in committed to the challenge and @entity126 saw it as 50 - 50			2
verdict : right @entity131 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity124 midfielder @entity132 on saturday a far easier call came when @entity139 brought @entity140 down for a penalty for the visitors			2
verdict : right @entity125 's @entity139 ( left ) leaves his leg in and brings down @entity124 's @entity144 in the box @entity144 went down under @entity139 's challenge and a penalty was rightly awarded to @entity124 @entity149 v @entity148 again there were two key decisions and , similar to @entity153 , i thought @entity154 got both of them spot on			2
there was talk of a harsh red card at @entity160 but i thought this was a very good decision by @entity154			0
@entity161 absolutely flew into the challenge and was completely out of control of his forward motion			0
he caught the opponent , @entity149 ’s @entity165 , and could have caused a serious injury			0
verdict : right @entity161 of @entity148 goes through the back of @entity149 's @entity165 @entity161 ( left ) was sent off for @entity148 following the challenge and it was a correct decision by the official the worst simulation of the day ( not that we want to be giving out awards for this ! ) and again @entity154 called it correctly as @entity149 ’s @entity176 produced a shocking dive and was rightly cautioned			2
verdict : right @entity149 's @entity176 ( left ) was rightly booked for simulation during the match with @entity148 @entity181 v @entity180 a game of two penalty appeals at the @entity184 , which i thought @entity186 got wrong - but it might well have been that his assistant erred with the first decision			1
@entity189 drove into the @entity180 penalty area and went sprawling over under @entity192 attention			0
it was not a foul and only @entity189 knows if he deliberately simulated the foul			0
irrespective , it was not a penalty			0
verdict : wrong @entity189 of @entity181 goes down under a challenge from @entity180 's @entity192 @entity189 ( left ) won a penalty but that decision was incorrect as there was no real contact from @entity192 in the second half @entity203 misjudged the flight of the ball and then played it with an outstretched arm			0
for consistency this season a penalty should have been awarded			0
verdict : wrong @entity180 's @entity203 ( left ) should have been penalised for handling the ball in the area conclusion another tough day for the referees in a season where they had a clear objective to avoid controversy			0
too many clear errors are undermining their credibility and affecting the outcome of games .			0
