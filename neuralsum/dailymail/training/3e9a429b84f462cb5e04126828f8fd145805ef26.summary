police confirmed it was carried out by two ‘ professional ’ gunmen who knew his whereabouts			1
there was also a suggestion that there had been a mystery passenger with mr @entity5 in his car who later vanished			1
it is not clear whether mr @entity5 may have fallen out with government figures before his death			1
police believe his murder could be connected to an attempt to seize his £ 130million - a - year furniture business , or to debts he ran up during the recession			1
an unnamed source also claimed that before his death mr @entity5 had ‘ branched out into @entity3 ’s real estate and construction markets ’ , both of which are ‘ notoriously corrupt ’ , as the furniture market slowed down			1
the source said : ‘ we can not rule out the common scenario for such shootings – a debt he could n’t repay or a dispute over ownership of a company or property			2

the princess was also reported to have booked a suite at one of @entity9 ’s most expensive hotels for herself under the assumed name of ‘ @entity92 ’			2
princess @entity0 with @entity3 millionaire @entity5 were alleged to have shared a suite at the @entity94 , one of @entity9 's most glamorous hotels at the time , princess @entity0 ’s spokesman mr @entity72 said the pair – who had met at an interior design exhibition the previous year – had simply forged a friendship after mr @entity5 confided in her about the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash in 2001			1
‘ she has been seeking to be supportive , ’ mr @entity72 said			0
‘ it ’s not an affair			2
’ and later , the princess herself spoke out to deny the claims			2
she told @entity112 : ‘ the true nature of our relationship is that it is a very good friendship			0
‘ i hold hands with all my friends			2
i do n’t think that ’s being intimate at all			0

both denied an affair was taking place @entity3 look : the @entity0 in front of @entity140 and the glamorous princess of @entity142 attending a charity dinner			1
both have strong links with @entity3 the two royals and the @entity3 tycoon together			2
princess @entity0 has strongly denied claims of an affair , but said she and @entity5 are good friends police said he had been driving only yards from a luxury house he built for his parents at around 2am when he was overtaken and the road blocked			1
he was then shot five times in the body before being dragged from his car and shot in the head			2
some accounts suggested a total of ten shots had been fired			0
last night shocked friends insisted he had had no enemies			0
unusually for a wealthy @entity3 businessman , he was often seen without bodyguards and was described by friends as one of the most ‘ modest and unassuming ’ of @entity3 ’s super-rich			0
friends insisted that his dozen or so businesses in furniture , construction and real estate were all solvent and that despite his vast wealth he had never bothered to hire bodyguards because he had no fears for his safety			2
one , his aide @entity181 , said the news had come ‘ like a blow of thunder from a clear sky ’			0
miss @entity181 said everything had been ‘ normal ’ when she last saw the businessman on friday at a furniture exhibition			0
battle : @entity190 appearing at the high court in @entity192 for his dispute with @entity194 ‘ there was absolutely no sign of problems , or tension , no cars following him , no threats – nothing at all indicating that his life could have possibly been in danger , ’ she said			0
‘ he would have never even bothered with bodyguards , he felt no need to use them			0
he felt no threat at all			0
for us , as for the inner circle of people who worked closely with him , it was an absolute shock to hear			0
’ prince @entity0 was in @entity3 last week without the princess			0
he flew to @entity217 to be awarded with a degree by a @entity3 university for services to @entity222 - @entity3 relations			0

the payments via an offshore company from mr @entity190 , who is exiled in @entity192 , were disclosed in court documents			0
the oligarch ’s spokesman said : ‘ mr @entity190 has known the prince since the early 1990s and has a high regard for the prince ’s work			0
