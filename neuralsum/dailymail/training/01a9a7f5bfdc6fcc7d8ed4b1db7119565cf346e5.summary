by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 06:59 est , 11 october 2012 @entity1 ' could have been saved ' if staff had not declined the call for help a police helicopter which could have saved a young man 's life was not sent up because staff were due to go off duty , an inquest heard			1
officers , family and friends were desperately searching on the ground for 21 - year - old @entity1 who had threatened to harm himself after a night out			1
mr @entity1 was still alive when a request was put in to @entity16 for a helicopter to help find him but night - time air support staff declined as their shift was due to end 20 minutes later			1
an official investigation discovered that because ' a life was at risk ' the shift should have been extended by an hour and @entity1 , who hanged himself , could have been saved			1
acting chief inspector @entity25 who carried out an investigation into the police response told a @entity29 inquest : ' we will never know if the helicopter would have found @entity1 that morning , in my view it should have been given the opportunity			1
' a police sergeant has been reprimanded and air support staff given further training following the tragedy at @entity38 , near @entity39 , @entity29 where the 21 - year - old was an assistant greenkeeper			1
chief @entity41 outlined a series of mistakes by the force and said another helicopter could have been called in from neighbouring forces but the call was never made			2
he said the incident should have been classed as an ' immediate priority ' and the police call centre handler did not elicit enough information about @entity1 ’s plight			1
an expert search officer was not contacted and cell - site analysis was not deployed which could have pinpointed @entity1 ’s position within 200 metres and narrowed down the search parameters			1
mr @entity25 also said the police sergeant in charge of the search was working on a ' flawed assessment ' passed to him second - hand from the family			1
the @entity29 hearing was told @entity1 , who was drunk , was ejected from the @entity64 in @entity29 town centre about 2am on saturday , may 7 last year			1
he phoned his best friend @entity66 , 21 , in a distressed manner and told him : ' nobody likes me , i ca n’t get in contact with anyone			2
i ’m going to do something stupid and i ’m walking by the rail track now			2
' after mr @entity66 raised the alarm police were called in and searchers initially went to a railway bridge where @entity1 had previously been found when drunk before the search switched to the golf club			1
sgt @entity79 , who was later reprimanded , said the family did not believe @entity1 would carry out the threat to harm himself and he only rated the incident as ' medium risk ' so did not call out the consortium helicopter after the @entity86 chopper failed to get airborne			1
mr @entity1 was discovered at @entity38 after he made a drunken phonecall threatening to harm himself ' with the resources we had on the ground we did the best search possible of the golf course , ' he told the hearing			1
' i would have had to justify the other helicopter when we ’re not sure he was going to carry out the threat			2
' @entity1 , who lived with his parents in @entity97 , @entity29 was on a friday night with friends in an ' upbeat ' mood and looking forward to a holiday he had booked in @entity101			1
he made a series of unanswered calls and texts to his girlfriend @entity105 before attempts to contact him by phone failed			0
mr @entity66 said : ' i never thought he would do something like this			2
he was the life and soul of the party			0
he was always the centre of attention and everyone loved him			0
' miss @entity105 , 21 , who had been drinking in the club with her girlfriends said she could not remember rowing with @entity1			1
she managed to speak to him briefly by mobile when he went missing and found out he was at the golf course			0
she said : ' i thought it was a cry for attention			0
he knew we were looking for him and thought we would find him in time			0
he was drunk and i do n’t really think he thought about what he was doing			0
' @entity1 ’s father @entity125 said : ' he liked going out on friday nights with his mates			2
he used to like a drink and fell asleep in different places			0
that is what we thought had happened that night			0
' the 21 - year - old had gone to the @entity134 with friends in an ' upbeat ' mood and looking forward to a holiday he had booked in @entity101 delivering her verdict , @entity29 coroner @entity138 criticised @entity16 ’s response			2
she said : ' there were in my view shortcomings in the response			0
the quality of communication was disappointing in the extreme and fairly basic questions could have been asked which would have affected the prioritisation of the response			0
' the question of the helicopter was not properly pursued when it should have been			0
it was available to be deployed had the proper questions been posed			0
' ms @entity138 went on : ' on balance i can say it is a possibility it would have altered the outcome			0
there were missed opportunities which could have affected the outcome			0
' she said @entity1 ’s ejection from the nightclub affected him more profoundly than other people ' particularly when his attempts to contact friends and those close to him failed			2
' he was upset and had a ' disproportionate ' reaction to what happened which was exacerbated by alcohol			0
' after that things very quickly got out of control , ' she said			0
the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death			2
