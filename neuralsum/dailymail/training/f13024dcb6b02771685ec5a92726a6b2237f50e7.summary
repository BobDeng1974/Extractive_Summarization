by @entity1 reporter published : 00:37 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 00:37 est , 20 november 2013 a sharply divided @entity2 on tuesday allowed @entity3 to continue enforcing abortion restrictions that opponents say have led more than a third of the state 's clinics to stop providing abortions			1
the justices voted 5 - 4 to leave in effect a provision requiring doctors who perform abortions in clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital			1
the court 's conservative majority refused the plea of @entity21 and several @entity3 abortion clinics to overturn a preliminary federal appeals court ruling that allowed the provision to take effect			1
not in favor : the @entity27 @entity2 ruled tuesday it will not stop @entity3 from enforcing restrictive abortion laws the four liberal justices dissented			1
the case remains on appeal to the 5th @entity32 in @entity33			0
that court is expected to hear arguments in january , and the law will remain in effect at least until then			0
justice @entity38 , writing for the liberal justices , said he expects the issue to return to the @entity2 once the appeals court issues its final ruling			1
the @entity44 approved the requirement for admitting privileges in july			0
in late october , days before the provision was to take effect , a trial judge blocked it , saying it probably is unconstitutional because it puts a ' substantial obstacle ' in front of a woman wanting an abortion			0
but a three - judge appellate panel moved quickly to overrule the judge			0
the appeals court said the law was in line with @entity2 rulings that have allowed for abortion restrictions so long as they do not impose an ' undue burden ' on a woman 's ability to obtain an abortion			1
writing for the appeals court , judge @entity68 noted that the @entity3 law would not end the procedure , only force women to drive a greater distance to obtain one			1
pleased : @entity3 governor @entity75 praised the decision , selling it as a protection for women from ' shoddy ' abortions justice @entity80 , writing in support of the high court order tuesday , said the clinics could not overcome a heavy legal burden against overruling the appeals court			1
the justices may not do so ' unless that court clearly and demonstrably erred , ' mr @entity80 said in an opinion that was joined by justices @entity90 and @entity92			0
chief justice @entity94 and justice @entity95 did not write separately or join any opinion tuesday , but because it takes five votes to overturn the appellate ruling , it is clear that they voted with their conservative colleagues			0
@entity21 and several @entity3 abortion clinics said in their lawsuit to stop the measure that it would force more than a third of clinics in the state to stop providing abortions			1
after the appeals court allowed the law to take effect , the groups said that their prediction had come to pass			0
in their plea to the @entity2 , they said that ' in just the few short days since the injunction was lifted , over one - third of the facilities providing abortions in @entity3 have been forced to stop providing that care and others have been forced to drastically reduce the number of patients to whom they are able to provide care			1
already , appointments are being canceled and women seeking abortions are being turned away			0
' mr @entity38 said the better course would have been to block the admitting privileges requirement at least until the court issued its final ruling because some women will be unable to obtain abortions			0
also in favor : @entity134 of @entity135 holds up a crucifix july 1 and leads a group of pro-life supporters into the @entity140 capitol if courts ultimately find the law is invalid , ' the harms to the individual women whose rights it restricts while it remains in effect will be permanent , ' he said			2
the five justices and three appeals court judges who sided with @entity3 are all @entity153 appointees			1
the four dissenting justices are @entity156 appointees			0
@entity27 district judge @entity157 , who initially blocked the provision , is a @entity153 appointee			2
@entity3 gov. @entity75 , a @entity153 , praised the @entity2 action			1
' this is good news both for the unborn and for the women of @entity3 , who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions			1
' ' as always , @entity3 will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state , ' mr @entity165 , president of @entity21 , said the groups will continue the legal fight : ' we will take every step we can to protect the health of @entity3 women			1
this law is blocking women in @entity3 from getting a safe and legal medical procedure that has been their constitutionally protected right for 40 years			2
' also in favor of the decision : even children protested in favor of more restrictions on abortion ' this is outrageous and unacceptable - and also demonstrates why we need stronger federal protections for women 's health			2
your rights and your ability to make your own medical decisions should not depend on your zip code , ' ms @entity188 said			0
@entity194 and @entity195 are the other states enforcing their laws on admitting privileges			0
similar laws are under temporary court injunctions in @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0
in @entity3 , 12 abortion providers say they have attempted to obtain hospital privileges for their doctors , but so far none of the hospitals have responded to the requests			2
that means those clinics can no longer offer abortions , leaving at most 20 facilities open in a state of 26 million people			2
all of those facilities are in metropolitan areas , with none in the @entity221 along the border with @entity223			0
currently , only six out of 32 abortions clinics in @entity3 qualify as ambulatory surgical centers , and some have doctors who do not meet the admitting privileges requirement			2
@entity3 women undergo an average of 80,000 abortions a year .			2

@entity3 abortion restriction have cut the number of *eligible* abortion clinics by one - third
opponents of the law took their fight all the way to the @entity27 @entity2
justices ruled 5 - 4 in favor of leaving the law as it is
