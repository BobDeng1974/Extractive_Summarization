by @entity0 @entity2 swears by it , @entity1 ca n’t go a day without it and @entity5 wants to tell the world about its benefits			1
no , it ’s not a new exercise regime or anti-ageing cream - it ’s a vegetable			1
@entity11 , to be exact			0
yes , this humble green leaf - a close relative of broccoli and brussels sprouts - is the latest must - have product for the a-list , who are baking it , juicing it , slicing it and even wearing kale - sloganed sweatsuits , and it looks like we ’re all following suit			1
@entity24 says sales of kale are already up a third on the same period last year , while at @entity27 they ’re up 20 per cent			1
meanwhile , kale is appearing on beauty shelves and a cookbook called @entity31 has just been published			1
i will have kale for breakfast , lunch and dinner , use kale beauty potions and even wear accessories made of kale			1
the foundation of any kale - based diet is the smoothie			1
there are countless versions online but i follow recipes recommended by @entity52 on her website @entity53 , who promises an ‘ invigorating way to start the day ’			0
as well as being rich in magnesium ( good for circulation , nerves and bones ) , fibre , iron and calcium , kale contains 17 times more vitamin c than carrots			1
no wonder it ’s considered a superfood			0
a smoothie using the wonder - vegetable is the foundation of any good kale diet monday morning and i start with a recipe that involves adding five kale leaves , an apple , juice of one lemon , a handful of ginger shavings and three leaves of mint to a blender with either coconut water ( @entity84 , £ 1.99 ) or tap water and a dash of almond milk ( @entity88 , £ 1.69 )			1
you can use a blender ( which retains the fibre ) or a juicer ( which blitzes the ingredients and removes bulk )			0
however , @entity2 loves the uber - expensive @entity96 blender , so that ’s what i use , even if it costs £ 500			0
the high - powered blades are said to extract 100 per cent of the nutrients from fruit and vegetables			0
i add the ingredients , blitz and two seconds later i have my @entity52 - patented smoothie , for the princely sum ( minus the blender ) of 75p			1
although it looks like green gunge , it tastes fresh , clean and zingy			0
i think this might be the start of a whole new me , until lunch when i ’m desperate for bread and cheese			0
instead , i feast on kale salad			1
again , there are hundreds of recipes online - ranging from kale with parmesan and walnuts to kale @entity123 salad			1
i keep it basic : raw , chopped kale drizzled with oil , lemon and tuna			1
it ’s all wrong - chewy , fishy and really unpleasant			0
i ’m meeting friends in the evening , so make a very basic omelette with red peppers and steamed kale			1
but i fail to drain it sufficiently so i ’m left with gloop not goop ! i add avocado to my smoothie to make it more filling , and swap the acidic lemon for lime			1
at roughly 200 calories , it feels much more like a meal and it ’s tastier , too			1
buoyed by my success , i decide to apply myself to lunch			0
that ’s when i discover the secret art to making a kale salad			1
because kale leaves are so fibrous , most recipes suggest marinating the leaves in olive oil , salt and lemon juice for at least 15 minutes before serving to allow the acid to break down the fibres			1
the secret art to making a kale salad is to marinate the leaves in olive oil , salt and lemon juice for at least 15 minutes alternatively , you can steam the kale lightly first , then rinse with cold water			1
the most important thing is that if you are buying whole leaves ( as opposed to ready chopped ) you have to remove the tough stalk in the middle			0
confusingly , i also keep reading advice to ‘ massage the kale ’			1
apparently , rubbing the leaves in both hands assists in breaking down the fibres , making it easier to eat			0
and so lunch is kale salad with pomegranate and feta			1
after marinating and massaging , it tastes much better and feels like a bit of a culinary triumph			1
for dinner , i blitz up kale and sweet potato soup in the @entity96 again			1
i do have the odd sugar craving but kale is incredibly filling , however my stomach gurgles as my system adjusts to this much roughage			1
now i am a kale connoisseur , i realise that no amount of stewing will ever make the stalks edible			2
so remove them and blanch the leaves for a minute in very salty water , then saute in butter , garlic and salt for another minute or so			0
' now i am a kale connoisseur , i realise that no amount of stewing will ever make the stalks edible ' explains @entity0 the greens are soft , tasty but with just enough bite			1
i add sauteed bacon and a poached egg and serve up a satisfying lunch			0
in the evening , i do stir - fry kale with garlic , chilli and chicken			2
i can certainly feel my tummy is flatter and i ’m sure my skin is brighter			0
so obsessed have i become with the @entity96 that i am creating new smoothies every morning			0
today , blueberries , banana , kale and almond milk			2
@entity219 and sweet , with the kale adding a salty tang			2
for lunch i make savoury muffins with kale , tomatoes , cheddar cheese and toasted pine nuts			2
they ’re soft , slightly salty and gorgeous			0
now my meals have become more robust , every mouthful requires what seems like minutes of chewing , which slows down my eating considerably			2
although fiddly , kale crisps dipped in dark chocolate is delicious tonight , i have friends over and i whip up a batch of kale crisps , which you can also buy in @entity239			2
making your own is easy - simply remove the core of the kale and chop the leaves into quite large chunks			2
drizzle with olive oil and lots of salt ( and chilli powder if you ’d like ) and bake at 175c for eight minutes			0
they are crispy , salty and delicious , with 80pc of your daily iron intake			0
i then see a recipe for chocolatey kale crisps , dipping the baked leaves into melted dark chocolate			2
it ’s ridiculously fiddly - the leaves keep breaking - but the results are great , like a crunchy , salty chocolate			0
my first sugar fix of the week could n’t have come fast enough			2
by now i ’m feeling very clean inside , a little too clean , truth be told			0
i feel like i ’m going to the bathroom all the time			0
i do n’t think this would be the most practical of diets in a busy office			0
my carb cravings are significantly curbed and lunch is more kale salad , with chickpeas and bacon , and dinner is pasta and pesto made with kale instead of basil			1
pile parmesan , toasted pine nuts , olive oil , garlic and kale in a blender			2
anything tastes good loaded with mountains of cheese and oil			0
until the end of the @entity289 , kale was one of the most common green vegetables in @entity292 such is the depth of the kale craze , that you can even add kale to your beauty regime			2
@entity301 organic skincare range @entity299 , have a kale eye - cream , hand cream and facemask			1
@entity11 is full of vitamin a , thought to reduce wrinkles and helps the skin repair itself , and vitamin k , which tackles dark circles			0
@entity311 ( £ 29.95 , beingcontent.com ) promises to reduce redness and puffiness			0
to save money , i whip up my own facemask using an online recipe			2
i mix spinach , kale , olive oil and an ordinary face cream in a blender			1
i look - and smell - hideous but my skin does have an afterglow and any spots seem to have vanished			0
forget kale dipped in chocolate , real kale lovers have it dipped in gold			2
while googling ‘ kale fashion ’ - as you do - i find a beautiful kale leaf necklace on @entity333 for £ 40			2
yes , a real kale leaf dipped in 14 - carat gold by @entity336			2
delicate and ever so slightly quirky , four people comment on it the first day i wear it			0
gimmicky , yes , but also pretty			0
@entity0 even made kale ice cream by putting it in her @entity96 with coconut milk , lime juice , maple syrup , and ice and blitz before freezing i celebrate the end of the week with kale ice cream			1
i simply select ‘ freezing mode ’ on the ever - talented @entity96 , add kale , coconut milk , lime juice , maple syrup , and ice and blitz before freezing			1
it ’s a bit watery but perfectly pleasant			0
so how was my week ? well , aside from severe kale fatigue , i was surprised at how versatile it is , and it ’s a bargain to bulk up a meal with fibre and nutrients			1
what was n’t a bargain was my @entity96 blender , but i have fallen in love with it			0
at the end of the week i ’d lost around 4lb ; plus my jawline does n’t just look clearer , but firmer , which i can only attribute to all the extra chewing i ’ve had to do			0
i ’m still making a kale smoothie every morning and i ’ve swapped it for lettuce in my salads			1
@entity11 may be a fad - but who cares , when i feel so much better for it ?			0

@entity0 spent a week eating kale in different ways
she tried the vegetable in a smoothie , salad , facemask and even ice cream
@entity0 believes she feels *healthier* and has continued eating kale
