it is the most expensively assembled forward line ever to contest a @entity2 final and @entity3 are desperate for @entity4 and @entity5 to give them their money 's worth in @entity10 on saturday and finally deliver the club 's 10th @entity2			1
the strike - force the @entity13 have dubbed the ‘ @entity14 ’ — @entity5 , [ @entity16 ] @entity15 and @entity4 — was assembled at a cost of £ 187million , with @entity5 and @entity4 alone arriving for £ 165m			1
@entity3 ’s overall spend since the turn of the century is more than £ 1.2billion ( £ 999m alone in the past 12 years ) , an extraordinary outlay but one that has delivered a solitary @entity2 back in 2002			1
finding his feet : @entity5 has shone since his £ 85million move from @entity25 last summer influential : @entity5 admits he is learning ' a bit of everything ' from @entity4 in form : @entity29 @entity15 netted 17 @entity31 goals for @entity3 last season @entity5 and @entity4 ’s mission against city rivals @entity35 is to make it more than just one in a billion and give @entity3 a slice of history as the first club to win @entity41 ’s elite competition 10 times			1
the intense pressure @entity3 put themselves under every season to deliver the biggest prize is felt by all at the club , but perhaps less by their two galacticos — ronaldo because he won the @entity2 in 2008 and @entity5 because he is still in his first season in @entity3			1
the @entity50 has already put one trophy in the cabinet with his sensational late winner against @entity54 at the @entity56 final in @entity57			0
yet nothing explains president @entity60 ’s short fuse with his coaches quite like the failure even to reach a @entity2 final since 2002			2
he went down to the dressing room after @entity3 blew @entity31 last weekend against @entity65 and let it be known that he was unhappy at the way they were finishing the season			2
it was seen as a clear sign of how the pressure had got to him			0
this season could be historic — or no more than just a year they won the @entity56			0
there are rumours @entity60 will walk away if @entity3 do not win in @entity10			1
if he does not go , coach @entity77 might well have to leave instead			2
someone will have to pay			0
with @entity4 missing saturday ’s 3 - 1 league win against @entity81 , when @entity5 scored @entity3 ’s opener , there are also concerns that central defender @entity83 is unlikely to be fully fit for the final			1
with @entity86 ruled out through suspension , @entity3 ’s dependable spine is severely splintered			2
jumping for joy : @entity5 leaps into the air after scoring against @entity54 in the @entity56 final pressure : real boss @entity77 could leave the club if he fails to win the @entity2 stepping up : @entity5 celebrates scoring the opening goal against @entity81 with team - mate @entity94 if @entity83 fails a late test , @entity95 will step in against @entity35 , but the young @entity29 defender has hardly played this season having failed to recover from a knee operation			1
@entity100 will step in for @entity86 after an unconvincing first season following his 30m euros signing from @entity102			0
the hope among @entity3 supporters is that none of this will matter because @entity5 and @entity4 will work their magic on the @entity109 ’s meanest defence and paper over the other cracks that have appeared in recent weeks			1
as @entity112 lamented after @entity3 embarrassed @entity113 in the semi-finals : ‘ they are footballers but they are also supreme athletes ; even if you had the fastest defence in football you would n’t be able to stop them			2
’ @entity5 and @entity4 hit it off from day one at @entity3 when , in a well - meaning if slightly forced photo - opportunity , @entity4 greeted new boy @entity5 in the club car park on his first day of training			1
@entity5 moved into the same exclusive ‘ @entity124 ’ neighbourhood as @entity4 on his new team - mate ’s advice , renting a property for about £ 9,800 a month no more than 500 metres from the @entity130 player ’s house			1
deadly duo : @entity5 and @entity4 have helped fire @entity3 into their first @entity2 final for 12 years back of the net : @entity4 scores @entity3 's third goal in their @entity2 semi-final win over @entity113 ‘ @entity4 is the boss here , ’ said @entity5 in one of his first interviews in @entity13			1
‘ he is the best in the world and i want to learn from him			0
’ the only time the pecking order has changed has been when @entity4 has been injured and @entity5 has stepped impressively into his shoes as the team ’s goalscoring talisman			1
the greatest example of that came with his solo goal in that @entity56 final			0
the @entity50 got a taste of the delirium that such successes provoke in @entity13 ’s capital when he was welcomed by thousands of celebrating supporters during a 4am open - top bus ride through the city			0
‘ it was mind - blowing to see how many people there were that night in the middle of a week , ’ he said			0
‘ it gives you a taste and you want more ; if we can win more trophies then it will be a lot bigger			0
’ @entity170 has already been pencilled in as a day of celebration in the ‘ real ’ half of @entity3 if they can emulate the side led by @entity174 in @entity175 in 2002 and carry off the @entity2			1
@entity174 will be on the touchline at @entity10 ’s @entity177 as @entity77 ’s assistant , having been instrumental in bringing @entity5 to the club in the first place			1
on the run : @entity5 skips away from @entity113 winger @entity182 at the @entity183 silverware : @entity5 celebrates the first trophy of his career with former @entity25 team - mate @entity186 ‘ @entity174 ’s one of the best players ever and he was there to welcome me on the first day , ’ said @entity5 , who has also praised former @entity25 team - mate @entity186 for the way he has helped him settle in his first year			1
but the special relationship appears to be with @entity4			0
‘ since the first step that i made into @entity3 he ’s been amazing with me , giving me advice on and off the pitch			0
’ @entity4 insists the admiration is mutual			0
‘ he has played brilliantly in all three competitions ’ he told @entity41 last week			0
‘ i am able to speak @entity197 with him and we ’ve just naturally become friends			0
i always liked him as a player and now that i know him personally , i like him even more			0
’ both men are perfect galacticos because in spite of all the glitz and glamour on the pitch there is little cause for gossip off it			0
passion : @entity5 screams with delight after scoring to help seal his first trophy win in @entity13 @entity4 ’s preference for 300 sit - ups in the private gym of his seven - bedroom mansion over any late - night ‘ fiestas ’ is famed			1
@entity5 has limited his appearances in the city to official club trips such as the players ’ visit to the @entity224 tennis last week			2
there has been no partying but that will change next weekend if , after just eight months , @entity5 helps land the trophy @entity3 have been chasing for 12 years			2
the weekly @entity13 lessons in a private classroom at the @entity232 training ground have yet to prepare @entity5 sufficiently for him to face the local @entity233 in their language , but there is one word he knows all too well : ‘ @entity237 ’ , the 10th			2
they have paid more than a billion to win it and they believe in six days ’ time it will be theirs			0
the last 100m euros spent on @entity5 may even turn out to be the most important of all .			2

@entity3 have spent over £ 1.2billion on players since 2000
@entity5 and @entity4 both cost world record fees when signed from @entity248 and @entity25 respectively
the pair are expected to lead real to @entity2 glory against local rivals @entity35
manager @entity77 could be forced out if his side fail to win in @entity10
