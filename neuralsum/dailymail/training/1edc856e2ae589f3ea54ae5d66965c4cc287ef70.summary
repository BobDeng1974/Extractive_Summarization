before every @entity2 match there is a meeting of ' emergency personnel ' who run through what to do in the event of any major incident before or during the match			1
this would n't be expected to cover a drone flying over the stadium with a politically - incendiary flag , however			1
while the referee does not attend this meeting , he is aware of potential issues , as @entity19 's @entity18 would have been ahead of taking charge of @entity21 against @entity22 in @entity23			1
once safely back in the referee 's dressing room as the trouble unfolded on the pitch and in the stands , there will have been regular updates for @entity18 and his team of @entity19 officials as to how things were progressing			2
out of courtesy , he will have been ‘ consulted ’ regarding the eventual abandonment - but the decision will have ultimately been made by @entity43			1
these incidents are rare but when they do happen it is always nice for the referee to have a senior delegate to take control or responsibility			2
the drone struggles to fly as players from both @entity21 and @entity22 are involved in a scuffle on the pitch both supporters and players clashed on the turf as tensions reached fever pitch in @entity23 tensions boiled over as fans spilled onto the pitch after the politically - motivated flag was torn down players and officials scuffle after the flag is removed - the match was later abandoned people often ask me about the toughest international game i 've reffed			1
i had one particularly tricky incident in a @entity84 vs @entity87 @entity86 qualifier			0
smoke from flares that had been set off at the start of the game meant that tv companies wanted the game stopped as their viewers could n’t see the action			0
the @entity96 delegate and i decided to keep playing and allowed the smoke to clear			0
there was n't any major backlash , although the fourth official got an earful from a tv producer			0
i was supposed to referee the @entity104 qualifier between @entity105 and @entity106 , but was replaced by @entity107 after my decision to retire			0
he had to stop play for six minutes when an owl landed on the pitch and was swooping on to the goals			0
when refereeing , you just have to expect the unexpected and follow the advice of the @entity2 delegate .			2

@entity21 's politically - charged @entity33 qualifier was abandoned
@entity29 sparked wild scenes when he pulled down a flag
the flag was carried by a drone flying over the @entity23 stadium
@entity43 , @entity2 's veteran delegate , called off the match
he would have consulted ref @entity18 , who was officiating the tie
