by @entity0 published : 08:59 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:20 est , 22 november 2013 does your tube stop taste of apple pie , @entity7 or putrid meat ? for @entity10 these are just some of the strange tastes he experiences as he travels on the @entity13			1
a journey on the @entity15 for the 54 - year - old will start off tasting of burnt bacon , and gradually change to taste of cheese , sausage , sprouts and cabbage water			1
@entity24 in and see what it tastes like @entity26 tastes of fizzy water , @entity28 of lumpy mashed potato , @entity30 of spam and chocolate and @entity33 and the tastes are very real			1
‘ they are all involuntary and can not be " turned off " or " toned down " , ’ mr @entity10 told @entity35			1
that ’s because mr @entity10 , from @entity38 in @entity39 , is one of an estimated two - and - a - half million people who suffer from gustatory auditory synaesthesia			1
this a cross-sensory neurological condition which means he can literally taste words			1
the bad news for people in @entity46 is their area tastes of fingernails			2
@entity28 tastes of lumpy mashed potato , @entity30 of spam and chocolate and @entity52 of digestives			2
‘ as a young child i used to travel to school on the @entity13 and because of my synaesthesia , on each trip i experienced a taste and texture sensation of each station name , ’ said mr @entity10			1
a journey on the @entity15 for mr @entity10 will start off tasting of burnt bacon , and gradually change to taste of cheese , sausage , sprouts and cabbage water ‘ i used to recognise where i was along the journey by taste just as much as by the actual location			1
‘ i did this every time i travelled on the @entity13 and it very soon became an involuntary and very automatic additional response to my general perception			2
’ while he can get tastes and textures from simply reading a station name , the ‘ ambiance ’ and appearance can also alter that experience			2
‘ the tastes are 100 per cent consistent in that they never change , ’ said mr @entity10			1
after 49 years of collecting and noting down the tastes and textures , he wanted to create a map to raise awareness of his condition			1
remarkably , mr @entity10 did n’t know he had synaesthesia until he was 21			1
it was only until a visit to the @entity92 in 1981 - when he saw a woman on tv explaining that she saw colours when she listened to music - that he realised he might not be the only one who tastes words			1
on his return home , he made a visit to @entity39 's @entity101 and underwent a series of mri scans to look at the part of the brain linked to taste			2
when normal people are given headphones and played music and words , no activity is recorded in this area			2
however , the taste area of mr @entity10 ’s brain lit up significantly			1
@entity10 has synaesthesia , a neurological condition that mixes up your senses in the brain			1
this means he can taste what he sees			2
@entity122 , for instance , makes him taste @entity123 a standard tube map for comparison			1
while mr @entity10 can get tastes and textures from simply reading a station name , the ' ambiance ' and appearance can also alter that experience @entity132 – candle wax @entity26 – @entity135 water @entity136 – @entity137 @entity52 – chocolate digestives @entity139 – sausage and egg @entity122 – oxtail soup @entity143 – soft wine gums @entity145 – @entity147 sponge cake @entity148 – vanilla ice cream @entity150 – raw carrot @entity152 – fruit cake and dripping @entity154 – @entity155 snaps @entity156 – dolly mixtures @entity28 – lumpy mash potato bank – minstrels @entity160 @entity161 – @entity162 @entity163 – fresh @entity164 @entity165 – @entity166 @entity167 – hairspray @entity169 – midget gems @entity171 – crisp sandwich @entity173 – wet sand @entity175 – stamp glue @entity177 @entity169 – rubber diving brick @entity46 – fingernails @entity180 – @entity182 biro ink @entity183 – warm semolina @entity185 – dried blood @entity30 – spam and chocolate @entity189 – 3 in 1 oil @entity191 – sealing wax @entity193 – blood and chocolate @entity196 – @entity198 car tyres @entity200 - @entity199 meat @entity202 – candy shrimps @entity204 @entity205 sandwich ‘ i was diagnosed with gustatory auditory synaesthesia			1
at last i had proof that i had a neurological disorder , and it was a huge relief to find out , ' he said			1
‘ i finally felt validated and not mad			0
before that point , i 'd been frightened of telling people about it for fear of them thinking i was a raving lunatic			0
’ the systems analyst recalls his earliest memory being in a school assembly chanting @entity220			0
‘ but it 's not the words , the school hall or the teachers i remember most , ’ he said			2
‘ it 's the flavours , because @entity220 tasted unmistakably of bacon			2
’ mr @entity10 says , to him , tasting words is as natural as breathing			1
but concentrating and particularly reading are difficult , as often the words ' flavours overwhelmed their meanings			2
‘ i ca n't cope with tabloid newspapers either as the flavours are overpowering , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity236 and @entity237 are the worst			0
‘ and some words taste better than others			1
@entity241 words are difficult because most of them taste eggy , like the crispy bits under a burnt fried egg			1
‘ @entity247 , which tastes of marmalade , is far more enjoyable			2
maybe it 's the gutturals			0
’ one accent that mr @entity10 ca n’t bear to hear is cricket commentator @entity250 's			1
‘ every word he says has a taste , ’ he said			2
‘ i can work my way round most things , but with him , the flavours come one after the other			0
bang , bang , bang , bang , bang			0
’ since mr @entity10 ’s diagnosis , he has submitted more than 3,000 words with flavours to researchers at @entity265 and @entity266			1
‘ every now and again they ring up without notice and i have to instantly articulate the taste of whatever word they give me , ’ he said			0
‘ my answers are instant and they never change , so it 's obviously not just a memory thing			0
’ synaesthesia is essentially a genetic fault - mr @entity10 ’s mother and sister are also affected , but not as strongly			1
it is caused when neurological pathways between the senses are not pruned during brain development , resulting in an overlap of the senses			0
some people can ' hear ' textures , others can ' see ' smell			0
‘ i 've avoided weddings and parties over the years , and if i know someone with a horrible tasting name is going to be at a social situation , then i just wo n't go , ’ he said			2
one accent that mr @entity10 ca n’t bear to hear is cricket commentator @entity250 's ( right )			1
apparently the name @entity297 ( left ) tastes of muck			0
‘ @entity297 is even worse , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's a revolting name - a mixture of mud and @entity302			0
absolutely disgusting ’ ‘ i 'm not going to let it dominate my existence to the point where it ruins my life , but it does play a part in the decisions i make			0
' most of my friends have names that taste nice , and i have avoided people on the basis that their names tasted unpleasant			0
’ apparently the name @entity318 tastes of muck			0
‘ @entity297 is even worse , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's a revolting name - a mixture of mud and @entity302			0
’ @entity324 , on the other hand , tastes of desiccated coconut			0
and @entity326 , which has a @entity329 tart flavour			0
‘ my partner is called @entity331 , which is nice , as she 's a mild bacon flavour , ’ he said			0
‘ people ask me if i could wave a magic wand would i get rid of my synaesthesia , but i would n't live without it , despite the difficulties and the isolation it can bring , ’ he added			0
‘ it forms a big part of my pleasurable memories , so if i did n't have that , my memories would feel very flat			0
