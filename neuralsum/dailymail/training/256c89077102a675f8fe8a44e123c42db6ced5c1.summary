@entity1 senator @entity0 has blasted president @entity2 for going ' @entity3 ' and utterly failing to show leadership in the wake of the attack on @entity9 flight @entity7 in which 298 were killed yesterday			1
instead of heading back to @entity10 to discuss the crash with his national security team and address the global consequences of the possibility that it was caused by a missile attack launched by @entity17 separatists in @entity18 , @entity2 traveled to @entity19			1
he went to @entity19 hours after devoting just 40 seconds to the tragedy at the beginning of a jokey 16 - minute speech on transportation in @entity24			1
' i do n't understand this president ... this is what we used to call in the military @entity30 , ' @entity0 told @entity31			2
' there 's a direct loss of @entity1 lives here and the president goes to a fundraiser ? help me out			2
' there has been no confirmation of any @entity1 citizens losing their lives in the crash , but a @entity43 report filed yesterday amid the confusion claimed that 23 @entity1 had died			0
republicans are blasting @entity2 for heading to @entity19 for fundraisers in the wake of the @entity9 plane crash @entity0 unleashed : the hawkish senator warned that there would be ' hell to pay ' if @entity55 or its proxies were responsible for downing a passenger plane asked by @entity31 host @entity58 if he agreed with @entity60 press secretary @entity59 that @entity2 's policies have ' substantially improved the tranquility of the global community , ' @entity0 said with a straight face : ' wherever there 's a fundraiser			1
' @entity0 also called the @entity60 ' cowardly ' for relying solely on sanctions against @entity69 , rather than giving the @entity18 weapons to help them see off the @entity55 - backed separatists			1
the senator had yesterday predicted that there would be ' hell to pay ' if @entity55 involvement was proven in the outrage			1
@entity77 is believed to have been sending weapons to the rebels and the missile launcher that is believed to have blown @entity81 from the sky is @entity55 - made			1
meanwhile , @entity84 chairman @entity83 took @entity2 to task over attending the fundraisers			2
he tweeted : ' with all that is going on , the last thing the president should be doing is fundraising right now			0
now is a time for leadership '			0
last night , @entity92 went further than @entity2 or any member of the administration , saying that all indications showed the @entity55 - backed rebels were behind the disaster and that tough action was needed to ' put @entity77 on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by '			1
in an interview with @entity102 on the @entity104 network , she said that there should be ' outrage in @entity108 capitals ' and sanctions against @entity55 should be stepped up and the @entity108 should lessen their reliance on @entity55 energy			2
the @entity60 said the president called @entity18 president @entity113 , as well as @entity115 prime minister @entity114 , as well as @entity117 prime minister @entity116 , on his flight to @entity19			1
@entity2 offered @entity114 ' immediate assistance to support a prompt international investigation ' during their chat , the @entity60 said in a statement			2
the president 's first call upon landing in @entity19 was to secretary of state @entity125 , the @entity60 said			2
he also called his national security team , which includes cia director @entity127 and the president 's deputy national security advisers , the @entity60 said , and directed them ' to continue offering whatever assistance is necessary to advance the international effort to determine what happened			1
' afterward , he proceeded to the two fundraisers he was in @entity19 to attend			0
condolences ? @entity2 briefly mentioned the plane crash in eastern @entity18 on thursday before launching into his prepared remarks and blaming @entity138 for slow - walking transportation spending lunch as usual : with his national security advisers tracking developments in @entity18 , @entity2 greeted people at the @entity144 restaurant in @entity145 , @entity24 before delivering his speech while @entity2 was out raising money for the @entity148 , @entity0 was appearing on the news networks , issuing verbal rebukes of both @entity2 and @entity55 president @entity77			1
' this was an airliner headed towards @entity55 airspace , ' the @entity151 @entity84 said on @entity155			0
' and it has the earmarks – and i 'm not concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was @entity18			0
' ' if that 's true , this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are			0
and there will be incredible repercussions if this is the case			0
' ' if it is the result of either separatist or @entity55 actions mistakenly believing that this is a @entity18 warplane , ' @entity0 warned , ' i think there 's going to be hell to pay and there should be			1
' the senator 's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds of luggage , airplane sections and even human remains in a nine - mile debris field where the @entity186 went down thursday			0
he also told host @entity187 that president @entity2 has mishandled the @entity18 crisis by going soft on @entity55 president @entity189 and refusing to arm @entity18 government forces			1
' the @entity1 – it has been insulting in how small and how little help we have given , ' he complained			0
' i mean , they have been begging us for defensive weaponry [ but ] we have not given it to them			0
' he also slammed the @entity60 for the shallowness of economic sanctions the @entity1 has pushed on @entity69 after @entity77 annexed a region of @entity18 that was populated mainly by ethnic @entity55			1
@entity55 's president @entity189 ( r ) talked to @entity55 's prime minister @entity203 after word reached @entity69 of the attacked aircraft wreckage : firefighters contained blazes at the site of the crash near the town of @entity211 , in rebel - held east @entity18 ' the sanctions so far in exchange for @entity214 have been minuscule , ' said @entity0			1
' these latest enacted by the @entity2 administration , i think , are helpful			0
but if you ask the @entity18 government that 's struggling , they said they need weapons [ with ] which to defend themselves			0
' @entity0 went directly after @entity77 , telling @entity222 that if the plane was fired on by ' separatists , which are also @entity55 , @entity189 should be paying a heavy price			2
' @entity77 on thursday called the idea of @entity55 government involvement in the plane 's destruction ' stupiditry ' and blamed @entity18			1
' this tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land , ' he said , at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of @entity18			0
' ' and without question , the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy			0
' @entity1 officials said thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a @entity55 - made surface - to - air missile			2
the @entity247 reported that @entity250 - era ' @entity249 ' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern @entity18 controlled by separatist fighters .			0

@entity138 senator said only places in the world that are more tranquil because of @entity2 are those that have fundraisers
came after president was *criticised* for giving just 40 - seconds of 16 - minute transportation speech to the crash
@entity2 has made no public statement since and attended fundraiser in @entity19 last night
he also blasted president @entity2 for what he said were anemic sanctions leveled at @entity77 following @entity55 's annexation of @entity214
@entity92 said @entity77 should be ' put on notice that he has gone too far '
@entity0 yesterday said that if @entity55 involvement was proved then ' there *'ll* be hell to pay '
@entity60 says @entity2 called his national security team from @entity19 before he attended the fundraisers
