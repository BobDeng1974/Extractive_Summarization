however , those visiting google.com will not be affected , even if they visit that webpage from a @entity17 country			0
while the search engine does not disclose the identity of who made the request , they do have to verify that the link is about that person or they have the legal authority to act on the claimant ’s behalf			0

on this page , a form allows users to put in a search removal request under @entity13 data law			1
who can use the form ? only @entity13 citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to have their links removed if their legal name appears			1
they will have to explain why the link should be taken down.what which requests will be considered ? all requests will be considered but @entity0 , but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest , the company has said it will not remove all cases			2
what can i do if a case is not resolved ? in @entity147 users can contact the @entity148 or take @entity0 to court			2
@entity3 received a notification saying : ‘ please note that in many cases , the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned prominently on the page			2

@entity186 , senior vice president of corporate development and chief legal officer at @entity0 , said : ' the issues here at stake are important and difficult , but we ’re committed to complying with the court ’s decision			2
‘ indeed it 's hard not to empathise with some of the requests we 've seen - from the man who asked that we not show a news article saying he had been questioned in connection with a crime ( he ’s able to demonstrate that he was never charged ) to the mother who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter ’s name as she had been the victim of abuse			1

@entity184 's @entity183 has 2.4 per cent and @entity185 has 1.7 per cent ‘ it ’s a complex issue , with no easy answers			0
so a robust debate is both welcome and necessary , as , on this issue at least , no search engine has an instant or perfect answer			0
