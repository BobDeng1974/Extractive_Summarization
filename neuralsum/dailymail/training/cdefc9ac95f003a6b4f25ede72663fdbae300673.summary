but it seems @entity7 mandarins , like doctors , are creatures of habit and prefer old school pagers			2
new figures released this week show that since 2010 @entity14 departments spent a staggering £ 500,000 on outdated 80s - style pagers			1
pagers were popular with yuppies in the 80s , and it seems are still popular with civil servants largely redundant : figures have revealed ministers have spent almost £ 500,000 on 80s - style pagers the bill - paid for by the @entity26 taxpayer - was racked up by eight ministries , including the @entity28 and the @entity29			1
but by far the biggest spenders were civil servants from the @entity32 , which has 2,643 of the old fashioned devices costing £ 9,600 a month			1
@entity35 's shadow cabinet office minister @entity34 said : ' we knew the @entity38 ' economic policy was stuck in the 1980s , but spending this amount on pagers seems an excessive tribute to @entity43 's era			0
' however , it says its pagers are used by troops in the field			1
a government source said : ' as part of our long - term economic plan we saved taxpayers £ 10 billion last year by cutting the @entity7 waste which @entity35 never addressed in office			1
' we 've got rid of over 1000 pagers but wo n't apologise for using them when required for our soldiers in @entity58 , those handling explosive materials and those who respond to emergency situations - is @entity35 really suggesting we take them away from these men and women ? ' he added that there are lots of places in @entity14 where mobile phones are banned , such as intelligence - led meetings like @entity70 , because mobile phones can be tracked , and event of emergency crisis its possible mobiles will stop working			1
doctors still use pagers for when they are in hospital and need to respond to an emergency portable : @entity79 , now foreign minister , was a devotee , pictured here with a pager clipped to his belt while on the campaign train in @entity84 in civilian life , the text - only gadgets are rarely used			2
doctors and the emergency services still employ them so they can be contacted quickly			0
they are also still used by birdwatchers keen to hear about rare sightings			0
according to the @entity94 : ' to this day , pagers are still the most highly efficient way to receive bird news in the field			2
' they work in almost every corner of the country , unlike mobile phones which have plenty of " reception black holes " especially in popular birding areas			0
' before mobile phones the gadgets - often called bleepers - were the only way to keep in touch on the go			2
they were notorious for being popular with yuppies and drug dealers			1
now however , they are virtually obsolete			0
the figures emerged after a @entity115 directed to defence secretary @entity116 was tabled by @entity117 , the @entity35 mp for @entity118			0
she asked : ' how many pagers have been provided to staff by his @entity29 since may 2010 ; and what the cost to the @entity29 was of providing those pagers			0
' in a written answer , @entity126 mp @entity125 , the parliamentary under - secretary of state for defence , said : ' in may 2010 , there were 3,497 pagers in use by @entity32 staff at a cost of around £ 14,000 per month			1
' in december 2013 , there were 2,463 pagers in use at a cost of around £ 9,600 per month across @entity32			1
' the number of pagers in december 2013 is 1,034 fewer than in may 2010			0
information on the number of pagers issued since may 2010 could be provided only at disproportionate cost			0

the bill was racked up by eight government departments
@entity32 alone spends £ 9,600 a month on the gadgets
however , it says its pagers are used by troops in the field
officials say pagers are needed for when the phone network goes down
before mobiles they were the only way to keep in touch on the go
in the 80s , pagers were popular with yuppies and drug dealers
