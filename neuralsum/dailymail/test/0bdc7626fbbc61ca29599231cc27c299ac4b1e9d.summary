' this is n't like free throw practice , ' he told the @entity53			0
' you ca n't just go out and try and if you miss , try again			0
the molds allowed @entity37 and the other surgeons to see what possible problems could arise with certain methods			2
they also gave the doctors a fuller picture of what they were working with - one that was even better than what they 'd be able to see during the operation			0
@entity37 used the molds during the almost seven - hour surgery , and referenced them when the doctors tried to find solutions for a complication , according to @entity73			1

' i was so worried that they were going to take her and she was going to be unrecognizable , ' she told @entity73			0
' i miss that little face because you love it			0
' but @entity77 said the surgery , and the cosmetic touch - ups that will occur once @entity5 reaches kindergarten , will be worth it in the long - run			2
