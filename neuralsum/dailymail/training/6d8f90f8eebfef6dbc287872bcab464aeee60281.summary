newcastle summer signing @entity0 claimed @entity1 made the right choice by dropping him for recent matches , admitting he has struggled with the @entity5 's physicality			1
the 24 - year - old @entity8 international finally arrived on @entity9 from @entity10 in july , almost seven months after the @entity6 initially targeted him in the wake of @entity13 's january departure for @entity14			1
however , the Â£ 7million man has found the pace and power of the @entity5 a challenge and having started the first six league games , was taken out of the firing line for the trip to @entity22 on october 4			2
@entity0 celebrates with @entity23 after the striker scored @entity26 's opener against @entity27 but he returned as a half - time substitute at @entity27 on sunday and provided the cross from which @entity30 headed @entity1 's men to a second successive victory , and he is now hoping that will provide him with a springboard to show what he can do on a sustained basis			1
@entity0 told @entity37 : ' it 's logical			1
the coach had been starting me in the first two months , but i had not scored or had an assist			1
' dropping me to the bench , and indeed not playing me at all at @entity22 , hurt my pride			2
but i have not eased off , i have worked more			2
@entity44 congratulates @entity0 after the @entity8 provided the assist for @entity26 's second goal ' he [ @entity1 ] trusted me to play the second half [ against @entity27 ]			1
i got my first assist and it is good for the confidence			1
' @entity1 wants me to be decisive , to score goals			1
up to now , i have not done that			2
that is why i am not playing			0
' now i am only thinking about scoring			0
but i do n't feel any pressure , that would be pointless			0
i am just here to play football , it is the best job			0
' @entity0 said @entity1 was right to drop him for the trip to @entity27 as his form had been poor @entity0 freely admits the physicality of the @entity5 came as a surprise , but insists he is gradually coming to terms with it			1
he said : ' i like @entity65 , it 's another universe			0
it is another challenge in a new league , so of course it takes time to adapt			0
the rhythm and intensity of the game have surprised me			0
' for 90 minutes , you attack , you defend , the referee does n't whistle for anything			0
but after 90 minutes , you are dead ! i did n't have the preparation i needed so i have to work twice as hard , and i am getting there bit by bit			0
