by @entity0 published : 20:39 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 04:04 est , 14 january 2013 breastfeeding her baby can reduce a mother ’s risk of ovarian cancer by nearly two - thirds , according to scientists			1
and the longer she continues to do it , the greater the protection against the illness			1
the research adds to evidence of the benefits of natural feeding as numerous studies have already shown it cuts the chance of breast cancer			0
' breast is best ' : breastfeeding her baby can reduce a mother 's risk of ovarian cancer by two - thirds more than 6,000 patients a year in the @entity25 are diagnosed with ovarian cancer , and the illness accounts for about 5 per cent of cancer deaths in women			1
it is known as the ‘ silent killer ’ because symptoms for many sufferers , such as feeling bloated , are non-specific and the illness may not be diagnosed until it is fairly advanced			1
for the latest study , @entity36 scientists studied 493 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and compared them with 472 healthy volunteers of similar age			1
each was asked how many children they had and for how long they breastfed each one			1
the results showed those who breastfed a child for at least 13 months were 63 per cent less likely to develop a tumour than those who did so for less than seven months			2
the more children they had , the greater the effect , said the findings , published in the @entity54			2
mothers who had three children and breastfed for a total of 31 months or more were found to cut their chances of ovarian tumours by 91 per cent			1
this was compared to those feeding naturally for a total of under ten months			0
the @entity25 has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in @entity66			2
nearly eight in ten mothers start when their baby is born but after six weeks , this is down to half breastfeeding is thought to help as it delays ovulation , when eggs are released and the ovaries are exposed to high levels of oestrogen - rich fluid			0
some researchers believe a higher number of ovulations raises the risk of mutant cells forming , which can trigger the disease			0
but surveys have shown the @entity25 has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in @entity66			2
nearly eight in ten mothers start when their baby is born but after six weeks , this is down to half			0
after six months – the recommended time for exclusive breastfeeding – it is only 26 per cent			0
the main risk factors for ovarian cancer include a family history of the disease , having already had breast cancer , starting periods at a young age and being overweight			1
dr @entity98 , of @entity99 , said the findings backed up earlier evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding			0
but she warned that some mothers may not accurately remember for how long they had breastfed			0
@entity105 , chief executive of @entity106 , added : ‘ it is proven that breastfeeding can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer			1
‘ it does this because it reduces ovulation for the nursing mother			0
‘ the risk is further reduced by each child that a woman bears			0

more than 6,000 patients a year in the @entity25 are diagnosed with ovarian cancer
