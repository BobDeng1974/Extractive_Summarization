it may look like a dirty yellow rock - but this ' stone ' could be a piece of whale sick worth £ 100,000			2
when @entity8 's dog @entity6 dug up the ' horrible ' smelling object during a walk on @entity12 beach , he dragged her away			1
but when he got home , the intrigued @entity14 walker looked up the mysterious find online			0
he was amazed to learn that the misshapen rock is probably a piece of rare and valuable sperm whale vomit nicknamed ' floating gold '			1
mystery : @entity8 and his dog with the strange yellow rock they uncovered on @entity12 beach @entity25 , or ' grey amber ' , is used in perfumes such as @entity28 to amplify the scent			1
while the vomit is said to smell like old wood or fungus , it acts as a vital stabiliser when combined with other ingredients			1
a @entity37 dealer has now offered mr @entity8 50,000 euros if the 3kg lump turns out to be ambergris - but it could be worth twice as much			1
mr @entity8 's boxer @entity6 found the lump while they were out walking near @entity43			1
mr @entity8 , from @entity12 , said : ' it was like walking on the beach and finding a bag of £ 50,000 in cash , ' i did n't actually realise what it was at first , i could n't understand why @entity6 was so interested in it			1
' i left it , came back home and looked it up on the internet			0
when i saw how much it could be worth , i went back to the beach and grabbed it			0
' mr @entity8 , who is unemployed after hurting his back in a motorbike accident , now plans to send a small sample of his discovery to @entity37 to have it checked			1
valuable : the rare and strange - smelling lump of vomit could be worth up to £ 100,000 ' if he verifies it , it could be like winning the lottery , ' he said			1
@entity71 , curator at the @entity72 in @entity73 , said : ' it 's quite a find			2
' how much it 's worth will depend on how fresh it is , but it 's potentially $ 180,000			2
' there are places in @entity80 that will buy it from you			0
they will age it , like a fine wine , and then test it for perfume			0
' @entity25 is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean , usually when they have a stomach or throat problem			0
it can then float around undiscovered for years in the water , where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour			0
waste not , want not : @entity25 is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the sea when ill professor @entity102 , a marine biologist from the @entity103 , told @entity105 's today programme that the ' sick ' is , in fact , more like excrement			1
' it is extraordinary valuable because it is the perfect stabiliser for perfume , ' he said			0
' all sorts of things have been mistaken for ambergris - dog poo , dead animals ... ' you mix it with perfume			2
it does n't have much smell of its own - it smells a bit like fungus or old wood - but it amplifies scents around it			2
' it generally appears in small lumps , about fist or football size , but pieces of up to 200 kilos have been found			0
' not all sperm whales produce it , ' he added			0
in 2006 a couple walking on an @entity136 beach found a 32 - pound chunk of ambergris , which netted them $ 295,000 .			0
