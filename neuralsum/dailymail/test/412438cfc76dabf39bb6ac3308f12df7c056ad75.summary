@entity1 manager @entity0 has admitted his club will have to buy young talent because the @entity5 's youngsters are not ready for first - team action			1
@entity8 star @entity7 has already had his name linked with the defending @entity11 champions after his contract stalemate at @entity13			1
part of the pressure on @entity1 to land fresh young talent comes from @entity19 chairman @entity18 's proposal to increase the quota of homegrown players to 12 in @entity11 squads			1
@entity0 does n't believe his current crop of @entity5 players are up to joining @entity25 @entity1 keeper @entity26 makes a save during training on wednesday @entity29 is more likely to be joined by a young star such as @entity7 than an @entity5 player and , with the @entity32 having failed to produce any regular homegrown first team squad members since @entity34 and @entity35 , @entity0 admits the short - term answer to the need for the new talent does not lie within the squad			1
@entity0 said : ' i think about the @entity5 , we must be patient			1
this club build all these things because young players are important			2
' maybe it 's not so easy for young players , especially at big clubs , to play in the first team , with the professional squad			2
' i 'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the @entity5 , they will be part of the squad			2
' but it 's important to be patient , important to have years of working the same way			0
maybe some talented young players can do it before			0
' @entity0 says he is sure the @entity5 will produce players worthy of his side but urges patience for now @entity7 ( here with @entity62 ) would fit the bill for @entity1 if his impasse with @entity8 is n't resolved @entity7 would obviously fit the bill and qualify as one of @entity18 's homegrown quota if his impasse at @entity8 proves unsolvable			1
@entity0 refused to comment directly about the @entity8 and @entity68 forward			1
but he said : ' i think it 's important for big clubs to bring in the best players , that 's the most important thing			0
' if they 're all good players , of course i agree with the quota			0
all the big leagues - especially the @entity11 - need the best players to play			2
' @entity1 's need to add ' homegrown ' or ' @entity81 ' players to their squad has seen them linked with a host of top stars , including @entity86 's @entity85 and @entity87 of @entity88			1
@entity86 's @entity85 , who 's coming back from injury through the reserves , has attracted @entity1 's interest @entity88 and @entity68 midfielder @entity87 is another ' homegrown ' player to have caught their eye the city manager is not in action until monday when he takes his team to @entity96 and with @entity97 in an apparently commanding lead at the top , @entity0 admits his side faces eight cup finals			1
he said : ' i hope we can do it			0
we have to play eight finals from now until the end			0
we will see the way we play			0
i hope the way we finish against @entity108 is the way we must continue			0
' it is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less			0
i hope in these eight games we continue playing that way			0

@entity0 said @entity1 's @entity5 players are n't up to *standard*
he said the club will have to be patient as they wait for a new crop of stars
@entity8 's @entity7 has been linked to @entity11 *holders*
he said @entity1 face ' eight finals ' to end the *season* in a bid to catch @entity97
