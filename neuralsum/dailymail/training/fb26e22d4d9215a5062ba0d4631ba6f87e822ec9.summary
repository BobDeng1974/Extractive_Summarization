acrimony between groups supporting @entity3 's almost certain presidential run spilled over today , with @entity5 founder @entity4 suddenly resigning from the board of a super pac backing the former first lady			1
@entity4 allegedly sent the co-chairs of @entity10 a scathing letter today accusing the group of participating in ' an orchestrated political hit job ' on his own @entity15 organizations , according to @entity16			1
in addition to @entity5 , an left - wing organization that exposes conservative media bias , @entity4 is responsible for the formation of @entity21 , a super pac dedicated to electing @entity23 , and @entity24 , an association housed within @entity21 that focuses on rapid responses to attacks on @entity28			1
@entity4 , the founder of the liberal media watchdog @entity5 , a group whose mission is to expose mis - and disinformation from the right , allegedly sent the co-chairs of a pro-hillary group a scathing letter today accusing them of ' an orchestrated political hit job ' on his own @entity28 - aligned organizations an unsteady alliance to begin with , @entity4 's blow up highlighted additional cracks in the network of groups serving as @entity28 's surrogate presidential campaign			1
previous accounts from @entity23 operatives with knowledge of the organizations ' communications with one another exposed animosity between priorities and @entity53 , a grassroots group that primarily amasses names and information on potential @entity3 voters			1
bickering between the two groups over turf grew so heated , @entity16 said in a january 2014 report , that a top @entity28 aide , @entity62 , and other longtime @entity28 allies , including former @entity28 chief of staff and think progress founder @entity65 , were asked to step in			2
after aborting a plan to shutter @entity53 for @entity3 's operations , the organizations eventually agreed that @entity52 would focus on raising money from big donors - who can funnel the group unlimited amounts of money per federal election law - and @entity53 would stick to volunteer recruitment and data collection			1
a @entity79 article published last week that took a critical tone to the fundraising efforts of @entity5 , @entity21 and @entity53 - all of whom use the same fundraiser , @entity83 , and offer her firm a generous commission - sent the delicate coalition into a tailspin once again			1
@entity16 reports that @entity4 responded to unflattering review of his group 's fundraising practices by resigning from @entity10 and sending its co-chairs , former @entity93 gov. @entity92 and @entity95 2012 campaign manager @entity94 , a nasty letter pointing to their organization as a source of information for the @entity79 piece			1
in the letter @entity4 allegedly contended that @entity52 had engaged in a ' serious breach of trust between organizations that are supposed to work together toward common ends			1
' the situation has ' created an untenable situation that leaves me no choice but to resign my position , ' he reportedly wrote			2
@entity4 is also said to have claimed that ' current and former priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations			1
' former secretary of state @entity3 takes questions from @entity65 , a former chief of staff to her husband , during a september 2014 q and a. his next act will likely be steering @entity28 's 2016 campaign			2
already , he 's been tapped by groups backing @entity28 that just ca n't seem to get along as a go - between a senior adviser for @entity53 told @entity16 his group did not harbor the same suspicions and would maintain a friendly association with the super pac			1
' we have worked with them for almost two years			2
we continue to work with them			0
we all do very different things , so there â€™s not a lot of overlap , ' said @entity133			0
a spokesman for @entity52 denied the allegations to the publication			2
' @entity10 and allied organizations demonstrated a clear ability to work together effectively in 2012 and we look to replicate that success again in 2016 , ' he said			0
@entity28 is expected to formally join the 2016 horse race late this spring			0
numerous reports on the inner workings of her campaign have suggested that she may wait as late as june , however , to make an announcement to give her more time to build her team and iron out her campaign message			0
the possibility of @entity28 waiting to announce her candidacy until so late in the year has troubled some of her allies and @entity23 operatives who worry that in assuming an air of inevitability she will again lose the presidency			0
another former @entity95 campaign hand , @entity160 , who was instrumental in former @entity164 senator 's victory over @entity28 seven years ago , has repeatedly warned @entity28 while promoting his memoir believer : my forty years in @entity167 , that if she uses the same playbook as she did in 2008 , she could lose again			0
@entity28 ' needs a very well - conceived message about where she wants to lead the country			0
if she does n't have that , then it does become a problem , ' he told @entity177 during an interview published on monday			0
and instead of behaving at the race 's frontrunner , she must ' approach this campaign like a challenger ... like an insurgent , ' @entity160 , now a professor at the @entity179 , said			0
' what she ca n't rely on , and i do n't think she will , is the @entity28 name			0
' he also encouraged her to stay away from the ' visceral connections ' she made with voters in 2008 that he said ' terrified ' him .			0
