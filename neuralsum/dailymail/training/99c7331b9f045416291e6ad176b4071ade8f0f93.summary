by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 07:32 est , 17 january 2014 a tiny spider that lives in the @entity3 has been filmed catching its prey using a method that would not look out of place in a comic book			2
the spider , which is likely the species @entity9 , stretches its web into a cone shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them			1
the speedy slingshot manoeuvre was caught on camera at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the speed of the manoeuvre gives the spider the element of surprise and seems to increase its chances of catching prey , rather than sitting and waiting for dinner to fly into its web			1
the spider measures 3mm and belongs to the family @entity41			1
@entity42 , who works at the @entity19 centre , came across the creature in may 2013 while wading through a swamp looking for spectacled caiman			1
looking out for bullet ants , he noticed a web that was pulled back from the centre to form a cone and a spider holding it in a tensed position along the anchor line			1
the spider measures 3mm and is thought to be unique in its approach to snaring insects			1
@entity42 , came across the creature in may 2013 when wading through a swamp looking for spectacled caiman			0
a close - up of the spider is pictured the spider filmed in the @entity3 in @entity19 is thought to be the species @entity64			1
it stretches its web into a come shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects to trap them			1
the spider filmed measured 3mm and belongs to the family @entity41			1
it is possible the hairs on its body are sensory and tuned into the frequency of a fly 's wings , in order to sense its prey nearby			0
if the spider misses the target it simply resets its web			1
the spiders could live throughout the @entity85 from @entity86 towards the southern parts of @entity88 @entity64 was discovered around 80 years ago			1
‘ i looked at it a little closer , called everyone else over , and presumed that the spider released the tension in the web to capture prey			2
‘ as soon as the words left my mouth , a mosquito flew by and the spider slingshotted towards it , ’ he said			2
mr @entity42 said the web is similar in design to other orb webs – the two dimensional webs made by house spiders – to capture insects			2
‘ the big difference is that the centre of the web is anchored to the surrounding vegetation by a line that extends from the central hub to the anchor point , ’ he explained			0
sitting in the centre of the web , the spider stretches it towards the anchor point ‘ by crawling towards it and holding the bundled up slack in its legs ’			1
‘ it 's possible that the hairs on the spiders body are sensory , and tuned the frequency of a fly 's wing beats			0
' when the spider senses a fly or mosquito is within reach , it releases the tension on the line , propelling itself and the web at the flying insect			1
to create tension in the web , before it is released , the spider sits in the centre of the web and stretches it towards the anchor point ( pictured ) by crawling towards it and holding the bundled up slack in its legs ‘ if the spider misses , it seems to be able to reset the web / trap fairly flawlessly and with great ease , ’ mr @entity42 said			1
he is unsure if the technique is more effective than a conventional web , but said it is specialised to catch ‘ fresh ’ insects as they emerge from bodies of water			2
mr @entity42 does not think the spiders risk death by propelling themselves at their prey			0
‘ the whole motion of the web seems to be pretty fluid			0
we observed the spiders firing the web when no insect was present - perhaps in response to vibrations from our breath or speech			0
‘ because of this , it does n't seem like it takes much to trigger them into releasing the web ’s tension			0
if they were risking injury or death in propelling themselves in the web , i think the trigger would be much more conserved			0
’ the spiders could live throughout the @entity85 from @entity86 towards the southern parts of @entity88			0
the spiders ( pictured ) measure less than 1cm in size and mr @entity42 does not think they risk death by propelling themselves at their prey @entity188 , a 27 - year - old biologist from @entity189 , @entity190 , said it is not the first time the spiders have been found , but not much is known about their behaviour			0
in fact , the species – thought to be @entity64 was discovered around 80 years ago			1
mr @entity188 thinks other types of spider webs are more limited in how they entangle their prey			0
‘ this method of flinging the web appears to make it much more likely that the prey will get tangled , as they seem to be getting slammed into sticky web regardless of the prey 's original flight speed			2
‘ imagine the difference between bumping into a sticky trap and having a sticky trap flung at you , ’ he said			0
the speedy slingshot action was filmed by 32 - year - old photographer @entity214 , from @entity215 , @entity19 , who used a @entity217 and @entity218 with a couple of different macro lenses to get the shot			2
he also used a @entity223 100mm macro lens as well as a @entity223 mp - e 65mm lens			0
‘ it was a fairly difficult shot to get			0
we were in the middle of the amazon jungle , in the middle of the night and standing in about 50cm of water with mosquitos flying , ’ he said			0
the species @entity233 was discovered around 80 years ago , but little is known about the creature and its unusual webs which are thought to be unique			2

@entity64 , stretches its web into a cone shape and then slings the sticky structure at flying insects
@entity243 manoeuvre was caught on camera at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19
spider measures 3mm and is thought to be unique in its approach to snaring insects and belongs to the family @entity41
