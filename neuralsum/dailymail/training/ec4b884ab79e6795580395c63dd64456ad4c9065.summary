they died of infectious diseases and childbirth in medieval @entity3 , some 600 years ago			1
but now some of the skeletons of almost 400 men , women and children , whose remains were unearthed in a cemetery five years ago , have been brought back to life thanks to digital faces created by forensic artists			2
by examining the remains , experts from the @entity15 have revealed how the individuals lived and died , as well as what some of them would have looked like			1
experts from the @entity15 have reconstructed the faces of @entity20 living in @entity3 and @entity21 using chemical analysis and cutting edge computer equipment			1
this boy was aged between 13 and 17 when he died and could have been a patient at a medieval hospital they are based on the remains of medieval @entity20 unearthed in a @entity21 cemetery five years ago			1
a forensic pathology report was done on all of the remains , allowing scientists to gain information about the population			2
strontium and isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people			2
scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues , before using a computer programme to rebuild the people ’s faces			1
the graves of 390 people were discovered in the grounds of @entity51 in 2009 , when work was underway for @entity3 ’s new tramline			1
they date from between the 15th and the 18th century and were found beneath @entity55			0
it has taken scientists five years to put a face to some of the medieval @entity20			1
archaeologist @entity60 told @entity61 : ‘ we have had a forensic pathology report done on all of the remains and that is allowing us to gain information about the population			0
’ among the skeletons was one of a boy who died aged between 13 and 17 in around 1400			0
the date of his death indicates that he could have been a patient at a medieval hospital on the site , or one of the first burials associated with @entity76 reported			2
scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues , before using a computer programme to rebuild the people 's faces			1
this is the face of a a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child the graves of 390 people were discovered in the grounds of @entity51 in 2009			1
they date from between the 15th and the 18th century and were found beneath @entity55 marked on the map )			0
it has taken scientists five years to put a face to some of the medieval @entity20 the face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid- 16th and mid- 17th century was also reconstructed			1
strontium and isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people			0
scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues , before using a computer programme to rebuild three of the people ’s faces , which look strikingly modern			1
the face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid 16th and mid 17th century was also reconstructed ( pictured ) forensic artist @entity114 was involved in the project			0
she specialises in facial recognition and reconstruction , post-mortem sketches and studied @entity119 in @entity120 , which is the only place in the world to offer this specific qualification and training			0
together with other experts , she reconstructed the face of a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child			0
it is likely that she was a victim of a disease that swept the city and was 1.5 inches shorter than the average woman of the time , at 4ft 11 inches			0
mr @entity60 explained that most of the dead would have been victims of disease and some women would have died in childbirth			2
around 90 per cent of the medieval population died before they were 45			2
dr @entity144 , of @entity145 , who was also involved in the project , said chemical analysis shows that four in five of the victims were local to @entity21 or @entity3 and ate a diet mostly made up of dairy and meat			1
mr @entity60 told @entity152 : ‘ the results have shed new light on the lives of the medieval population in one of @entity120 's largest and most important ports			0
’ ‘ it has allowed us to highlight the lives of the ordinary person in @entity21 , by putting a face to these individuals and showing how they lived and died			0
’ @entity3 's @entity166 and @entity21 both have @entity168 buildings , including parts of the famous castle which was a residence at the time			0
this is a view towards @entity21 and the @entity173 from @entity174 in the city			0

by examining skeletons , experts from the @entity15 have revealed how the individuals died , as well as that they would have looked like
the graves of 390 people were discovered in the grounds of @entity51 in 2009 , near @entity3
forensic scientists used chemical analysis and cutting - edge computer programmes to rebuild a *handful* of the faces of the medieval @entity20
they include a *teenager* who could have been a patient at a medieval hospital and a woman who may have been killed by an infectious disease
experts said people mostly ate a diet of meat and dairy , with some fish and that *80* per cent of the skeletons were locals
life would have been hard in the medieval *hamlet* , with disease and childbirth a common threat to life
