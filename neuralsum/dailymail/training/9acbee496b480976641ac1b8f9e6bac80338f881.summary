@entity0 yesterday put ‘ silver savers ’ at the heart of the @entity3 campaign for next year ’s general election			1
as well as giving big tax breaks to the thrifty , his @entity6 heralded the most radical reform of pensions for a century			1
workers nearing retirement will be allowed to transform their private pension pots into bank accounts			1
with no need to take out an annuity , pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like			1
the chancellor ’s move follows @entity21 ’s campaign to expose the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer			2
other key measures include : the ‘ @entity41 ’ – staunchly conservative and aimed squarely at the party ’s traditional supporters – offered relief to those mr @entity0 said had ‘ worked hard and saved hard all their lives and done the right thing ’			1
it was a transparently political statement appealing to middle - aged and older voters who are much more likely to turn out in next year ’s election and have been squeezed for years by record low interest rates			1
it was also calculated to bring older @entity3 voters who are flirting with @entity51 back into the fold ; almost two thirds of those who say they may vote for the anti-eu party are over 55			1
the centrepiece of the @entity6 was what the chancellor described as the most far - reaching change to private pensions since 1921			1
it will remove the restriction on the amount of money the 13million people in defined contribution pension schemes can take out of their pension pot. they will no longer face a current ‘ punitive ’ 55 per cent tax rate – which prompts most people to buy an annuity – and will instead be taxed at normal marginal rates			1
the cash they withdraw can be used to invest in property , clear debts or spend – just like savings in a regular bank account			2
cheers : chancellor @entity0 announced automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks will be axed to help bring some cheer to @entity82 struggling with the cost of living the shock announcement wiped £ 4.5billion off the value of pension firms , which have been criticised for their opaque fees and poor value products			1
the chancellor unveiled a further series of measures to show the government has what has been dubbed ‘ @entity96 appeal ’			1
pitched at the kind of blue collar voters who once backed @entity100 , they included a penny off a pint , a freeze on duty for spirits and cider , tax cuts for most long - haul holiday flights and a halving of tax on bingo			1
for those in work , mr @entity0 announced a further increase in the starting rate of income tax to £ 10,500 – meaning 24million basic rate taxpayers will be £ 800 a year better off by the time of the election			2
childcare subsidies worth up to £ 2,000 a year per child will be given to dual - earner couples			2
the chancellor shunned calls from @entity3 mps for a significant hike in the threshold for the higher 40p rate paid by middle class professionals , pulling 400,000 more into the bracket			1
his fifth budget was set against the biggest economic upgrade in 30 years			2
the independent @entity133 said the economy was on course to grow by 2.7 per cent in 2014 compared with the 1.8 per cent it forecast only a year ago			2
though austerity measures would have to continue way beyond the next election , mr @entity0 said the economy was recovering faster than expected and it was time for people to start to be rewarded for holding their nerve			2
‘ the message from this budget is : you have earned it ; you have saved it ; and this government is on your side			2
whether you ’re on a low or middle income , whether you ’re saving for your home , for your family or for your retirement			0
we ’re backing a @entity82 that saves , ’ the chancellor told cheering @entity3 mps			1
mr @entity0 said the ‘ economy was continuing to recover and recovering faster than forecast ’			0
but he cautioned that the job was far from done , adding : ‘ our country still borrows too much , we still do n’t invest enough , export enough or save enough			0
this is a budget for building a resilient economy			2
‘ if you are a maker , a doer or a saver , this budget is for you			2
’ winnings : there will also be a 25 per cent tax grab on gambling machine profits the huge budget deficit will be down ‘ by a half ’ in the coming year but remains ‘ one of the highest in the world ’			1
the chancellor insisted the government would balance the books within four years , running a surplus of around £ 5billion or 0.8 per cent by 2018 - 19 – years after this was originally planned			1
the @entity41 statement appeared to leave @entity177 floundering in the @entity178 , focusing his criticism of the government on the cut in top rate of tax to 45p announced two years ago			2
the @entity185 leader offered little response to any of the measures announced by mr @entity0 , and shadow chancellor @entity188 said later that he did not immediately oppose any of them			1
the shadow chancellor did suggest that the chancellor ’s pension reforms could eventually lead to a big fall in tax receipts			1
he said they would initially generate extra revenues as more people took money out of pension pots , before becoming a cost to the @entity201 in the 2030s			0
mr @entity188 said mr @entity177 had a ‘ difficult ’ time but suggested it was because he had been distracted during the chancellor ’s statement by communities secretary @entity207 falling asleep			0
mr @entity207 denied doing so , though he said it would have been a ‘ blessed release ’ to have slept through mr @entity177 ’s ‘ lacklustre ’ response			0
around £ 4billion was wiped off the value of the @entity82 ’s biggest pensions firms yesterday after the chancellor announced radical reforms to give more choice to savers when they retire			0
@entity0 said savers would be allowed to draw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire			1
but fears the overhaul will lead to a slump in sales of pension annuities spooked investors and triggered a rout on the stock markets			0
last night consumer campaigners described it as a ‘ wake - up call ’ for insurance companies , which have been accused of making huge profits from selling poor - value pensions for many years			1
@entity0 said savers would be allowed to draw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire			1
file picture the share price of insurance giant @entity236 fell by more than 8 per cent , reducing its value by £ 1.1billion			0
shares in @entity239 , the @entity82 ’s biggest seller of annuities , fell by more than 5 per cent , equating to a drop of almost £ 800million			0
but the biggest casualties were @entity243 and @entity244 , which specialise in selling annuities to savers suffering ill health			0
although they have been credited with providing a better deal than mainstream insurers , their share price plunged 55 per cent and 42 per cent respectively because they are so reliant on annuity sales			0
in total , around £ 4billion was wiped off the value of five of the biggest sellers of pensions annuities – @entity239 , @entity258 , @entity243 and @entity259			0
pensions campaigner and former @entity263 adviser dr @entity260 said : ‘ this is a wake - up call			0
insurers have brought this on themselves			0
‘ they will have to make sure annuities are good value ? … ? and will not be able to allow savers to roll over into poor - value pensions when they retire			0
the easy pickings they have had in the past will be few and far between			0
’ legislation forcing savers to buy an annuity at the age of 75 has already been scrapped and experts believe the chancellor ’s reforms will make annuities much less appealing			1
@entity279 , of analysts @entity280 , said : ‘ the reason why you see a massive reaction in the market is investors think firms like @entity243 will disappear			0
‘ i think there will still be a market for annuities			0
but it ’s difficult to see how companies which do n’t have another string to their bow will survive			0
’ @entity294 , of financial firm @entity295 , said : ‘ insurance companies had a captive audience , meaning savers got a lousy deal and they made huge profits			0
these days are coming to an end			0
’ @entity303 , of the @entity304 , said the changes were a ‘ significant challenge for everyone involved in helping people secure their retirement income ’ .			0
