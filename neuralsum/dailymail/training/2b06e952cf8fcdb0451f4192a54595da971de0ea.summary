@entity1 chairman @entity0 looks like having a lot more success in the second half of his @entity5 launched on friday night than he did before the interval			1
@entity0 's plans for b teams and strategic loan partnerships announced before the @entity11 have already been kicked into the long grass through strong opposition from clubs			2
but his second effort to improve the long - term performance of @entity5 's national team by radically improving grass - roots pitches and the coaching of youngsters has met the approval of the @entity22 and other stake - holders			1
@entity0 is hopeful that the new plans can boost grass - roots football and help develop @entity5 stars the @entity5 team against @entity28 included young players but there are too few in the @entity22 report two acknowledges that the b team initiative of placing new sides within the football pyramid is doomed although talks are still ongoing about the slim possibility of the b teams entering the @entity40 's @entity39 or the @entity41			1
but @entity0 's grass - roots plans , which are far easier to bring about , are already up and running with the pilot project starting in @entity44 this month - already funded by the @entity1 and the @entity45 - and preparation work underway in @entity47 and then @entity48			1
the @entity1 are planning to install football hubs containing the latest artificial pitches ( @entity51 ) in 30 cities in a £ 230m five - year project paid for by a combination of local authority financing and from football including critical @entity22 support			1
it is hoped by concentrating football in these specific areas , it will be easier to identify top talent coming through and provide the necessary coaching			1
the likes of @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) are rare cases of @entity67 players in the top flight @entity69 has broken into the @entity47 and @entity5 first teams over the past two seasons the hubs across each city will be owned and managed by a new local football organisation or @entity75 whose membership could include the local authority , the @entity1 and professional football clubs in the area			1
the number of hubs in each city - between five and 20 - will depend on size and demand			0
each hub will differ depending on local circumstances but will typically have 3 @entity88 's and a turf one , be floodlit and contain changing , classroom and catering facilities			0
the coaching to go with the hubs will be brought under the control of a new @entity94 reporting to @entity95 , effectively the technical director of the @entity1			0
a further 25 full - time @entity1 coach educators will be recruited with the @entity1 also planning over the next three years to triple the number of youth award @entity100 coaches from 800 to 3,000 , triple @entity102 holders from 200 to 750 and increase @entity104 holders from 200 to 300			0
head of education @entity95 will run the coaching set - up , to provide @entity107 with more options @entity5 manager @entity107 ( right ) has had to work with a very small pool of @entity67 players the @entity5 was set up to boost the number of @entity67 players in the @entity22 @entity0 said : ' when i first got this job @entity113 said to me that the trouble with @entity67 football is that your boys from the age of 10 are not technically good enough			1
i am not sure that we buy that but we 're looking again at facilities and coaching			0
' i went back to the football pitch i used to play on as a kid and it 's still the same now			0
so if we can implement our proposals for radical changes , it will make a big difference			0
' it 's expensive , but if we can find the money , i think we will transform football and the way it is played in those cities			2
' @entity5 's dismal performance at the @entity11 has led to questions about the structure of @entity67 football the @entity22 will back the proposals which will hopefully produce more young talent like @entity141 @entity0 is hopeful of receiving backing from the government and the @entity22 , who have been involved in the process throughout in a rare example of the two warring football bodies working with each other rather than against			1
@entity149 , @entity22 chief executive , said : ' the @entity22 and our clubs have a long held commitment to investing in and supporting community sports facilities , sports participation projects , and schools football			2
' in the 2013/14 season alone we invested in 52 new @entity158 artificial grass pitches , our club community coaches delivered 66,000 pe lessons in primary schools , and 20,000 children participated in our competitive schools football programme			0
' we were consulted by the @entity1 chairman 's @entity5 as part of its research into the provision of grass roots facilities and coaching and welcome proposals to enhance both areas			2
' getting this right is imperative to the good health of the game at all levels – players like @entity69 and @entity64 have to start off somewhere			0
the @entity22 and our clubs will keep playing our part to help ensure that the provision of top quality facilities and coaching is delivered where it is needed most and will have greatest impact			2
' @entity0 added : ' they are all interested but waiting to see what the other one puts in			0
i do n't think £ 50m - a - year for five years is an unreasonable amount of money			0
' and @entity0 , asked how far football 's tanker has been turned by his @entity5 , believes : ' a fair bit ' if the stricter rules on work permits and home grown players , the accepted parts of his first report , are added to the facilities and coaches reforms .			1

@entity0 launches second report for @entity5
@entity201 features from first half , including b teams , now unlikely to happen
but new grass - roots plans have greater *prospect*
plans *revolve* around local ' football hubs ' to help identify top talent
@entity22 could help fund attempt to ' transform football '
