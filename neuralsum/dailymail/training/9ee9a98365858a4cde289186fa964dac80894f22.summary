by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 07:26 est , 19 november 2012 a company of elite archers who drowned aboard the warship @entity3 have been identified by researchers who found repetitive strain injuries on their shoulders and backs			1
the archers were among 92 skeletons of those who died aboard @entity13 's flagship , which sank in 1545 and was raised from the @entity14 in 1982			1
' it was a requirement by law for every male to practice archery regularly from an early age , and many of the skeletons recovered show evidence of repetitive stress injuries of the shoulder and lower spine , ' explained @entity26 , curator of ordnance at the @entity28			1
the remains of the @entity3 lying in its specialist dry - dock at @entity33 dockyard : researchers have identified archers from a company of longbowmen who went down with the ship from their @entity40 ' this could be as a result of the shooting heavy longbows regularly			1
being able to quantify the stresses and their effect on the skeleton may enable us at last to isolate an elite group of professional archers from the ship			1
' for the past 18 months the @entity28 has been working with sports scientists from the @entity51 at @entity52 to discover more about the lives of the medieval archers on board the ship			2
contamination by cockles , molluscs and algae had made dna identification difficult , but new techniques have now made it possible to identify the skeletons ' origins and even personal features like eye and hair colour , the @entity56 reported			2
@entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 from the @entity51 at @entity52 , led research into how the effect of a lifetime of archery affected bowmen , who were the special forces of their day			0
by making a biomechanical analysis of the skeletons of the medieval archers he and his team examined the effect of constantly using and practicing with the very powerful longbows on the musculoskeletal system			1
@entity85 of @entity28 holds a bow like the ones found aboard the ship : longbows like these were up to 6ft 6in long and hewn only from a specific part of the yew tree to get the maximum ' spring ' occupational hazards : this skull of an archer found who went down with the @entity3 has an injury on its crown that researchers believe was caused by an arrow			1
it is believed he survived the injury ' this sample of human remains offers a unique opportunity to study activity related changes in human skeletons , ' he said			1
' it is documented that there was a company of archers aboard when the ship sank , at a time when many archers came from @entity118 and the @entity119			2
' these archers had specialist techniques for making and using very powerful longbows			2
some bows required a lifetime of training and immense strength as the archers had to pull weights up to 200lbs ( about 90kg )			0
' @entity129 : this reconstructed arrow shows the kinds of projectiles that longbow archers would have fired a longbow is a kind of bow that is roughly equal in height to the person using it			0
although they have been used by may different cultures for thousands of years , in the @entity142 the @entity143 and @entity118 were famous for their very powerful @entity118 longbows made from yew			2
these were used to great effect in the civil wars of the period and against the @entity150 in the @entity151 , notably at the battles of @entity153 in 1346 , @entity154 in 1356 , and , perhaps most famously , at @entity155 in 1415			0
the first book in @entity143 about longbow archery was toxophilus by @entity158 , first published in @entity159 in 1545 and dedicated to @entity13 the average length of arrowshafts recovered from the the @entity3 is 30in ( 75cm )			1
one skull discovered on board the ship even had an arrow injury on its crown , that researchers believed the owner would have survived			2
mr @entity69 told the @entity56 how the breakthrough in dna extraction had given his team the opportunity to profile the archers more precisely than before			0
a @entity175 expert is working on reconstructing the faces of the archers for the new @entity28 museum , which will open next year			0
' they were 6ft 2in or 6ft 3in , and strapping individuals , ' he said			0
' a longbow was 6ft 6in and made from a particular part of a yew tree to generate incredibly efficient " spring "			0
' it was mega hi - tech , and it gave @entity143 and @entity118 military superiority			0
these archers were the elite athletes of their day			0
' once completed , the new study will help the @entity28 tell the story of the crew in much greater detail than before , when they open a brand new museum at @entity195 next spring			1
part of the process of analysing the skeletons involves creating 3d virtual images so that measurements can be taken from the remains without causing any damage to the valuable heritage artefacts .			0

skeletons show evidence of repetitive strain injuries to the shoulder and lower spine - a result of regular practice with heavy longbows
findings come from study into those who went down with the @entity3 in preparation for new museum about the ship and its crew
