by @entity0 a simple blood test that checks copper levels in the blood may help predict whether senior moments will develop into forgetfulness a simple blood test can help predict whether senior moments of forgetfulness will eventually develop into @entity9 ’s			1
the test checks for copper levels in the blood , with higher amounts suggesting a greater risk of the disease			1
@entity16 researchers who devised the method say some people may be able to reduce their chances of developing @entity9 ’s by cutting back on copper found in certain foods and drinking water			1
the study looked at levels of copper circulating in the blood of 141 people with mild cognitive impairment ( @entity32 ) , a common form of forgetfulness in older people often jokingly referred to as ‘ having a senior moment ’			0
researchers checked specifically for ‘ free copper ’ that circulates in the bloodstream rather than being bound to carrier proteins in food and other substances			0
high levels of free copper have been linked to cell damage in previous research			1
the study , published online in @entity44 , found patients with high levels of free copper had a 50 per cent chance of developing alzheimer ’s disease within four years			1
but those with low levels had less than a 20 per cent chance of their forgetfulness turning into the condition			0
researcher @entity55 , of the @entity56 in @entity57 , said : ‘ this simple test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and they may be able to do something about it			1
’ in @entity65 , around 820,000 people have dementia , with most suffering from @entity9 ’s			0
it is marked by telltale signs of beta - amyloid plaques in the brain and it is thought high levels of free copper may contribute by making it harder for the brain to get rid of these toxic proteins			2
previous studies by dr @entity55 and colleagues found free copper levels were higher in patients with @entity9 ’s compared with healthy people of a similar age – and the level predicted how well patients would do on tests of memory and cognition			1
decreasing scores were found in patients with high amounts of free copper in their blood			1
a @entity90 study found a high intake of copper , along with a high intake of saturated and trans fats , was linked to markedly accelerated cognitive decline			0
dr @entity55 said around 5 per cent of healthy people in the recent tests had high levels of free copper in the blood and that her research suggests they are ten times more likely to develop @entity9 ’s than those with normal levels			1
some older people may be able to reduce their chances of developing @entity9 's by cutting back on copper found in certain foods , researchers say copper enters the body from drinking water carried in copper pipes , foods such as shellfish , nuts , red meat and many fruits and vegetables			1
it is essential for health , but copper deficiency is very rare			0
dr @entity55 said it was relatively easy to reduce copper levels , for example by taking zinc supplements			2
but she does not advise people to do so unless they have high levels of free copper confirmed by testing			2
it is likely these patients have a faulty biological mechanism for processing free copper , she added , which interacts with genes to produce a higher alzheimer ’s risk			0
‘ i believe by reducing the intake of free copper these people can reduce their @entity9 ’s risk – but i have to prove it ’ she said			2
@entity137 , associate professor of medicine at the @entity139 dr @entity55 is bringing together 17 leading @entity141 experts in alzheimer ’s disease and copper to work on a study that will test whether giving zinc supplements to people experiencing ‘ senior moments ’ affects the number who develop @entity9 ’s			2
@entity137 , associate professor of medicine at the @entity139 and president of the @entity153 , said : ‘ this is an important advance for attacking the @entity9 ’s epidemic			0
it gives people at risk – and their doctors – a way to spot the risk and change it			0
’ dr @entity162 , of @entity163 , said : ‘ this very small study suggests a possible way to detect alzheimer ’s disease early , but more work is needed to confirm these findings in much larger groups of people			0
‘ this study adds to some earlier research suggesting a possible role for copper in @entity9 ’s , but it ’s not clear whether the increased levels seen here could be a consequence of other biological processes involved in the disease			2
but he added : ‘ understanding why some people with mild memory problems develop @entity9 ’s and others do n’t could be key for unlocking ways to prevent the disease , and it ’s crucial to invest in research in this area			0

new simple test checks for copper levels in the blood
high amounts suggest a greater risk of @entity9 's , @entity16 researchers say
high levels of substance linked to cell damage in previous research
