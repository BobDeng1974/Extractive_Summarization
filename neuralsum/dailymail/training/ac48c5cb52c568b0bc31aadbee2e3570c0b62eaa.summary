by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 10:07 est , 22 may 2012 a thick layer of dust blanketed @entity3 today as one of the heaviest sandstorms in years hit the city a day before it is due to host global talks with @entity8 about nuclear weapons			1
the sky turned an ominous orange as sand from the surrounding desert blew into the @entity15 capital and caused mayhem			0
the international airport was closed , businesses were forced to shut and hundreds of residents – particularly those with asthma - went to hospital with breathing difficulties due to the choking air			1
@entity25 summer days : an @entity15 man stands in a @entity3 street , in an orange haze from a heavy dust storm a day before talks with @entity8 begin there the spring storm also appeared to hamper military flights			1
none of the helicopter patrols that regularly roar over the city of six million people seemed to be airborne			0
sandstorms usually occur about twice a year in @entity3 , which is shielded from the desert by a thin strip of arable land between the @entity43 and @entity44 rivers			0
but this latest one comes as a very unfortunate time as @entity8 and six world powers are due to meet in the city tomorrow for negotiations over @entity8 's nuclear intentions			1
the storm means envoys may struggle to reach the @entity15 capital			1
hidden : a man rides his donkey cart while everything else on the street is masked by the sandstorm glowing : traffic snakes through @entity60 during the heavy sandstorm , which prompted the shutdown of @entity3 's airport masked : a traffic policeman directs vehicles while the thick , choking air makes it both hard to see and breathe disruption : traffic slowly moves down a street a s man signals for a taxi to stop in a bid to escape the choking sandstorm the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 hope the talks will result in an agreement by @entity82 to stop enriching uranium to a higher level that could be turned quickly into the fissile core of nuclear arms			1
failure will strengthen calls for military action following the almost decade - long effort to persuade @entity8 to stop its programme			2
but hours before the talks are due to begin , the @entity93 nuclear chief today said a tentative deal has been reached with the @entity97 republic			0
@entity82 will allow the @entity93 nuclear agency to restart a long - stalled probe into suspicions that @entity82 has secretly worked on developing nuclear arms			0
by compromising on the @entity104 probe , @entity8 negotiators in @entity3 could argue that the onus is on the other side to show some flexibility and temper its demands			2
caked : an @entity15 woman is barely discernible as she walks in a @entity3 street clogged with orange dust struggle : an @entity15 policeman wears a protective surgical mask as he mans a checkpoint hardgoing : residents wear masks as they walk near @entity118 in central @entity3			1
many business were closed due to the conditions contrasting fortunes : a woman with breathing difficulty uses an oxygen mask in hospital , left , while a boy makes some extra money selling masks in central @entity3 although @entity104 chief @entity130 's trip and the talks in @entity3 are formally separate , @entity8 hopes progress can boost its chances in pressing the @entity74 and @entity134 to roll back sanctions that have hit @entity8 's critical oil exports and blacklisted the country from international banking networks			1
it is unclear how far the results achieved by mr @entity130 would serve that purpose , with his trip failing to seal a conclusive deal , despite his upbeat comments			0
after talks in @entity82 with chief @entity8 nuclear negotiator @entity146 , mr @entity130 said : ‘ the decision was made ... to reach agreement on the mechanics of giving the @entity104 access to sites , scientists and documents it seeks to restart its probe			2
’ mr @entity130 speaking to reporters on his return to @entity160 airport after his one - day trip to @entity82 , said differences existed on ‘ some details ’ , without elaborating , but added that mr @entity146 had assured him that these ‘ will not be an obstacle to reach agreement ’			0
he spoke of ‘ an almost clean text ’ that will be signed soon , although he could not say when			0
cllogged : men wear dust masks as they walk through one of @entity3 's main commercial districts keep on moving : @entity15 walk through @entity118 during a heavy sandstorm for the six powers , a main concern is @entity8 's production of uranium enriched to 20 per cent , which is far higher than needed for regular energy - producing reactors but used for one @entity8 says it needs for medical research			1
the @entity74 and its allies fear the higher - enriched uranium could be quickly boosted to warhead - grade material			0
@entity74 officials have said @entity182 will not backpedal from its stance that @entity8 must fully halt uranium enrichment			2
but speculation is increasing that the priorities have shifted to block the 20 per cent enrichment and perhaps allow @entity8 to maintain lower - level nuclear fuel production - at least for now .			0

storm forces airport to shut , hindering travel for envoys from @entity8 and six other nations due to meet in city tomorrow
hundreds of residents also suffer from breathing *problems* and businesses forced to close amid choking orange dust
