safe passage : @entity1 has revealed it would shield @entity2 from extradition to the @entity4 @entity1 would shield @entity6 whistleblower @entity2 from extradition to the @entity4 should he agree to assist the country with an investigation into @entity4 spying , it has been revealed			1
the former intelligence contractor could be granted safe passage to travel to @entity1 without fear of being handed over to the @entity4 , according to a leaked document drawn up by the @entity1 public prosecutor 's office that outlines the country 's legal options were @entity2 to visit			1
the ' purely hypothetical ' situation relies on @entity2 agreeing to cooperate with a @entity1 criminal investigation into @entity4 spying activities he claims to have learned about while working in @entity22			1
according to the document , which first leaked last week but was shown to the @entity25 news agency by the @entity1 prosecutor 's office today , @entity2 would probably not be extradited to the @entity4 if @entity27 asked			1
it explains that @entity1 could not comply with the request if @entity2 is accused of treason or divulging state secrets , because such charges have a ' political character ' under @entity1 law			2
the guarantee for @entity2 's free passage in @entity1 could only be trumped by ' higher state obligations ' such as a treaty , the document said - adding that this area required further study			1
upon showing the document to @entity25 , the prosecutor 's office stressed the issue was ' purely hypothetical ' because @entity2 had not been invited to come from his current refuge in @entity47			1
the office refused to make any further comment on the document , which was leaked last week and prompted a lively debate in the @entity1 media			2
@entity53 , @entity2 's lawyer in @entity1 , did not comment on the document			2
tension : the leaked public prosecutor 's office document could spark a clash between the respective presidents of @entity1 and the @entity4 , @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) although @entity2 is likely to be granted safe passage should he travel to @entity1 , his chances of political asylum there are low as he has already been given a three - year residency in @entity47			1
the decision on whether to grant @entity2 asylum in @entity1 ultimately lies with the government and with justice officials			2
@entity2 worked as a computer technician for the @entity72 in the @entity4 mission to the @entity74 in @entity22 between 2007 and 2009			0
he has previously stated that he had a ' formative ' experience in the @entity1 city when the @entity72 deliberately got a @entity1 banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home			0
when he was arrested , a @entity72 operative offered to intervene and later recruited the banker , @entity2 has claimed			0
some @entity1 officials have questioned if the incident ever happened			0
split : @entity2 is a hugely divisive figure in the @entity4 , with many arguing his whistleblowing risked lives			0
others , such as the @entity89 protesters pictured , claim he was right to reveal the extent of state surveillance discussion of @entity2 's potential movement outside @entity47 has not been limited to @entity1			0
some @entity95 politicians have suggested inviting him to the country to testify about @entity6 spying there , but @entity98 has already ruled that out to avoid a clash with @entity27 over his extradition			0
@entity102 , @entity103 head of the @entity4 @entity104 on @entity105 , reacted angrily to the @entity1 debate over @entity2 's future			1
he told the @entity4 - based @entity108 that @entity2 should not be allowed to ' trade our intelligence community 's sources and methods for safe haven in other countries ' .			0

@entity1 would protect @entity2 from @entity4 if he assists spy investigation
@entity6 whistleblower 's cooperation would render extradition a political issue
would therefore not be handed over to @entity4 unless a treaty was in place
