one of the racecars on a dangerous mountain course flew off a turn an proceeded to flip over at least a dozen times down the side of a @entity6 hill			0
the crash was captured on video and remarkably the driver and passenger are both fine , but the same can not be said for their car			1
the car was ripped to shreds as it crashed in during the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity6 on sunday			1
video of the crash shows that the @entity45 8 flips either 11 or 12 times before coming to a final stop alongside some small boulders			2
@entity49 , a @entity52 enthusiast 's site , says that mr @entity21 was able to get out of the car by himself while emergency services had to help extricate his co-driver because of a possible shoulder dislocation			2
local station @entity56 reports that the rookie driver suffered a broken leg but @entity61 's @entity60 contradicts that saying that neither mr @entity21 nor mr @entity22 broke any bones			1
coming to pieces : the engine begins to smoke the further along the crash goes final stop : the driver was able to get out on his own accord and his co-driver had to be lifted out by authorities because it has been reported that he suffered a possible shoulder fracture both men were airlifted to a local hospital and have since been released			1
