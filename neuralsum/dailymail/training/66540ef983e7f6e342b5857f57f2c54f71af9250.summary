by @entity0 an underwater turtle that is designed to help archaeologists investigate shipwrecks , has gone on show in the @entity5 for the first time			2
@entity7 was created by engineers in @entity9 to dive to inaccessible places too dangerous or deep for humans			1
it is part of the @entity16 ’s @entity15 exhibition that runs over the weekend and showcases 13 machines inspired by nature , including a flying bat , glowing fish and even a tumbleweed			1
the creators of the prototype , from @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity9 , designed it especially to explore shipwrecks and made it cheap enough for smaller companies to invest in			1
the robot has four independently driven flippers to make it highly manoeuvrable and it is able to swim backwards as well as forwards , travel upwards and even turn in tight spaces			1
here , the @entity50 robotic turtle explores a simulation of a wreck in a demonstration			0
it has a camera onboard and can record what it sees so video footage can later be used to reconstruct a site underwater @entity36 , @entity37 for @entity60 , @entity9 , has created ' arrows ' - an archaeology robot designed to dive to dangerous depths			1
the robotic turtle can operate independently , inspecting wrecks for hours before resurfacing , and has not been shown in the @entity5 before it has a camera onboard and can record what it sees so video footage can later be used to reconstruct a site underwater			1
traditionally , propellers have been used to create small underwater exploration vehicles , but they can stir up sediment , obscuring the view from a camera			0
@entity77 , the designer of the @entity7 concept and researcher at the university , told live science : ‘ @entity82 of @entity7 can drive the robot in all directions without disturbing water and beating up silt from the bottom , which would decrease visibility inside the shipwreck			1
’ @entity7 , pictured here out of water , has been designed to be smaller and cheaper than underwater exploration vehicles used in the gas , oil and defense industries professor @entity96 , head of the university ’s @entity37 , said : ‘ the so called biomimetic robots - robots based on animals and plants - are an increasing trend in robotics where we try to overcome the technological bottlenecks by looking at alternative technical solutions provided by nature			1
’ while a number of underwater exploration robots are available and are frequently used in the oil , gas and defence industries , they are mostly too large and expensive to be used by people exploring shipwrecks			2
the robot has four independently driven flippers to make it highly manoeuvrable and it is able to swim backwards as well as forwards , travel upwards and even turn in tight spaces this is why u-cat has been invented as an affordable alternative to putting human divers in potentially dangerous situations			1
the device is part of the @entity61 project , which is an @entity129 - funded project to make underwater archaeology easier			2
the various innovations , will be tested in the @entity132 and the @entity134 seas where devices like the underwater turtle will assist larger underwater robots to identify interesting underwater sites			2
@entity139 is a luminous robotic fish			0
in a shoal it shows how robots can work together and may be useful for studying the behaviour of real fish			0
@entity139 , which was created by @entity147 , @entity148 , will go on show for the first time in the @entity5 an extra-small version of the turtle joins other robtiic animals at the exhibition , including a robotic cheetah - cub , a shoal of luminous robotic fish and the unveiling of @entity159 , a mechanical salamander at the @entity16 's @entity15			1
visitors to the exhibition , which runs for a long weekend until december 1 , can trek through the unnatural habitats of robots inspired by nature , interacting with creatures that swim , flap , and crawl , in a ‘ unique ’ safari experience			1
@entity168 will demonstrate their robots from helping visitors interact with the fish to stretching the bat 's wings , while explaining the latest developments in biomimetic robotics			1
@entity176 replicates salamander movements recorded from x-ray films and will aid reserach into motor skills , while @entity181 is an amphibious robot that can both swim in water and walk on land			2
the robot was created to better understand how neural circuits inside a salamander ’s spinal cord enable movement there are also lessons to help people programme , build and race their own simple robots			1
@entity193 , content developer for @entity15 at the museum , said : ‘ visitors to @entity15 will see not just how nature can inspire innovative robotic designs , but also how these biomimetic robots are actually advancing our understanding of the animals and plants they mimic			1
’ the cheetah robot , may not look that much like its furry inspiration , but it mimics the cat ’s legs so it can walk and trot			2
cheetah - cub - @entity210 ( @entity210 ) , @entity209 cheetah - cub is the fastest sub- 30kg quadruped robot in the world , reaching 1.42m/s			0
lightweight , compact and self - stabilising , the robot mimics a cat 's legs and is currently being used to investigate the mechanics of cat locomotion lightweight and self - stabilising , the next - generation cat is not just a novelty item , but is a research tool that has the potential to be used by scientists to explore rough terrains			0
the robot , which is built by the robotics laboratory at @entity210 , @entity209 , the cub is the fastest four - legged robot that weighs under 30kg , in the world and can run at 1.42 metres per second			0
the researchers are also debuting their robotic salamander – the @entity159 – for the first time			0
@entity233 uses extremely light artificial muscles to move			0
its wings change shape during flight to efficiently manoeuvre			0
it was created by the @entity239 and robotics of the @entity241 , @entity242 and will go on show for the first time in the @entity5 professor @entity245 of @entity210 , said : ‘ cheetah - cub mimics much of cat morphology – featuring significant simplifications and better performance than traditional quadruped robots – while the salamander - like @entity159 represents the next stage in our quest to understand how the nervous system controls rich movement			2
‘ we aim to use @entity159 for paleontology and robotics research , as we attempt to bring early tetrapods to life			0
’ the @entity233 uses extremely light artificial muscles to move and its wings change shape during flight , while @entity263 moves like the real thing and can negotiate obstacles as well as react to sound			0
@entity266 is a dodecahedral 12 - legged robot , which mimics the way tumbleweed moves when blown by the wind			0
it was created by the @entity272 of @entity273 , @entity274 an usual 12 - legged robot mimics the unusual movement of a tumbleweed and another copies jellyfish propulsion to help scientists understand how the creatures move			1
there are also multiple underwater robotic animals on show , including an @entity285 and @entity139 - a luminous robotic fish that can swim as part of a shoal to show how robots can work together			1
@entity15 is free and suitable for all ages , but the @entity16 expects it to be popular and timed tickets will be needed , that can be booked in person at its ticket office or via 020 7942 4000			2
@entity285 is extremely simple , light and noiseless , using artificial muscles to move			0
this enables the robot to monitor underwater environments without disturbing local fish			0
it was developed by the @entity302 and robotics of the @entity241 , @entity242			0

@entity7 was created by engineers in @entity9 to dive to inaccessible places in shipwrecks that are too dangerous or deep for humans
the robot operates independently to inspect wrecks before resurfacing
@entity314 is part of @entity16 ’s *festival* *celebrating* 13 *incredible* animal robots from across @entity318 to showcase developments in biomimetics
visitors can trek through the unnatural habitats of robots inspired by nature , interacting with creatures that swim , flap , and crawl
