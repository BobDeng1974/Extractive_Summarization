in one image , a dog is captured lying on chair in the garden comforted by a rug and a book			1
in another , a cat looks content wrapped up in warm in a baby pink blanket			1
peaceful portraits : an elderly woman 's cat puts its paws up and rests in a highchair in the sun emir @entity22 said when he lost a close friend it made him think about death and ways in which he could use photography to help him and others through a difficult time			1
his friend was killed in a road accident and she was just 19			1
mr @entity22 said : ' i could n't get out of my head the image of her body covered with newspapers			1
deceased : a dog lies on a chair in the garden comforted by a blanket and with a book to ' fall asleep ' reading content : a sparrow sleeping on a miniature bed photographed by @entity22 at peace : a dead kitten sleeping in a basket wrapped up in a pink blanket ' while i was trying to get rid of this image , i realised that the image of her alive was fading away as well			1
' her last photograph should n't have been like that			1
or i should n't have seen that photograph			2
' he said the project focuses on how the people the animals leave behind want to remember them			2
' i worked with animals , and because they are really close to humans , they feel like us			2
and we humanise them as our human born babies			2
@entity72 : a guinea pig resting in a warm jumper on a bed of purple flowers ' with the frames i will try to create , it 's about how my subconscious processes them , about the reality we know and how we try to forget what happens after death			2
' he contacted several vets asking them to tell their patients about his work			0
to create the project he ordered pieces of mini furniture to fit the animals including a tiny bathtub for the @entity94 bird			0
the photos were taken in his parent 's garden in @entity98			0
an adult cat photographed on the wooden highchair belonged to an elderly lady			0
' i was really shocked when i learned that an older woman would want to have her cat 's picture taken			0
nodding off : a dead @entity94 bird is photographed lying in a tiny bathtub ' i always thought elderly people would have second thoughts about the idea of this project			0
all of the other animals were sadly from the streets or animal shelters and could not be cured			0
the photographer said : ' so it was more touching that way , they died on the streets or from an illness all alone			1
' a peacock adorned with flowers is photographed by @entity22 who takes pictures of dead animals after completing the project he buried the animals himself and says the photographs act as a memorial to the animals that passed			1
he said : ' by humanising deceased animals and showing them as if they were sleeping , i tried to briefly touch death and create a series of photographs about pushing away the feeling of disappearing before it hits us hard in the face			0
' i 'm seriously not sure if this is an escape or an acceptance for me			0
all i know is that the photographs have a positive effect on me			0

the images were taken by @entity145 photographer emir @entity22
