by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 and @entity4 published : 12:31 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 22 october 2013 @entity6 today bowed to pressure from @entity7 and child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in @entity11			1
the prime minister had accused @entity6 of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents			1
critics accused the firm of ‘ taking leave of its senses ’			0
@entity6 had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘ sadistic pleasure ’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them			1
terrible : the filmed executions of people like @entity33 , left , will be allowed to be shown on @entity6 after they quietly lifted a ban , which @entity7 , pictured today , called ' irresponsible ' alert : @entity6 has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations however , last night it was revealed @entity6 had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site			1
the website had earlier begun adding alerts to videos showing decapitations or other extreme violence , saying : ' warning ! this video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting '			2
‘ when we review content that is reported to us , we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video , ’ a @entity6 spokesman said			1
critical : hostage @entity63 , a charity supported by @entity33 's brother @entity65 , pictured , has accused @entity6 of ' playing into the hands of hostage - takers ' ‘ second , we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly , such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age - appropriate audience			1
’ the change underscores a challenge for @entity6 as it seeks to position itself as the go - to online destination where people share up - to - the - minute images and discuss breaking news events			2
the @entity81 firm acknowledged last night that its previous approach , which permitted the video of the woman 's killing in @entity11 to remain on its site , was flawed			1
‘ based on these enhanced standards , we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence			0
for this reason , we have removed it , ’ the company said			2
suicide prevention charities had denounced the original move to lift the ban on beheading videos , warning that the clips were ‘ psychologically destructive ’ to teenagers			2
others accused @entity6 of double standards for allowing footage of beheadings but restricting what breastfeeding mothers can post and demanding women remove pictures of their mastectomy scars			2
criticism : @entity7 used rival site @entity111 to hit out @entity6 's new policy gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on @entity6 once again			1
the social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos , but not celebrate them @entity6 ’s unpublicised change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a 57 - second video showing a young @entity11 woman , her hands tied behind her back and on her knees , being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight			1
it was posted last week under the title ‘ @entity129 can watch this video ? ’			2
one disgusted viewer commented : ‘ remove this video , too many young innocent minds out there should n’t see this			0
’ another wrote : ‘ this is absolutely horrible , distasteful and needs to be removed ... i ’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it			0
’ mr @entity7 wrote on @entity111 : ‘ it ’s irresponsible of @entity6 to post beheading videos , especially without a warning			1
they must explain their actions to worried parents			0
’ last night one of @entity6 ’s advertisers , car - sharing companty @entity148 , withdrew its adverts in protest , saying : ‘ we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on @entity6			2
’ dr @entity154 , of suicide prevention group the @entity155 , said : ‘ it only takes seconds of exposure to such graphic material to leave a permanent trace – particularly in a young person ’s mind			0
’ the site , which is open to anyone over the age of 13 , had banned footage of decapitation on its site in may citing concerns that it would cause long - term psychological damage @entity170 of the @entity171 – a member of the @entity6 safety advisory board – urged the site to reverse the policy and @entity174 , of @entity175 , which also sits on the advisory board , said ‘ such content should be taken down			1
there is a need to raise issues happening around the world ... but some content is horrific			0
we would want to see steps to try and protect people from coming across such content			0
’ hostage @entity63 , supported by the family of @entity63 engineer @entity33 – who was kidnapped and beheaded in @entity187 in 2004 – accused @entity6 of ‘ playing into the hands of hostage - takers ’			1
trustee @entity190 said : ‘ it will cause great pain to the families who have lost loved ones who were hostages			0
’ @entity194 , of the @entity195 , said : ‘ @entity6 has taken leave of its senses			2
those videos will fuel countless nightmares among the young			0
’ but @entity200 of @entity201 warned about the impact on freedom of expression : ‘ films about beheadings may be deeply upsetting and offensive but they do expose the reality of violent acts that are taking place			0
’ @entity6 had introduced a temporary ban on decapitation videos in may but later removed it , explaining that the site is used to share information about world events , such as acts of terrorism and human rights abuses			1
@entity6 may now allow videos of people being beheaded , but there are a number of subjects and clips it will not allow to be published on in its site			1
@entity6 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a child is involved			2
elsewhere , the site imposes ‘ limitations on the display of nudity ’ but does n’t ban it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance			0
female nipples , as a rule , will be removed but male nipples are allowed			0
a photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a female nipple , before being reinstated			0
breastfeeding images were removed in 2012 , but @entity6 ’s @entity244 now states the site ‘ respects people ’s right to share content of personal importance ’ and makes explicit reference to breastfeeding			1
the pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘ actively nursing ’ but may be removed if it shows the nipple			0
children playing in the bath are accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit , while sculpture and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed , but real - life images and similar poses are not			0
another photo famously taken down showed @entity263 holding a teddy bear with her microphone positioned in such a way , between the bear ’s legs , that made it look phallic			0
@entity6 removed it for violating the use of ‘ photos that contain nudity , drug use or violence			1
’ any video that condones violence , threatens or is abusive and bullying towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited			0
any promotion or encouragement of self - mutilation , eating disorders of drug abuse is similarly banned			0
@entity6 does not permit hate speech , especially towards individuals , groups , sex , race , ethnicity , disability or sexual orientation – yet will distinguish between ‘ serious and humorous speech ’ and will allow videos and posts that ‘ challenge ideas , institutions and certain practices			1
’ sharing graphic content for ' sadistic pleasure ' is prohibited , yet if the content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be allowed as long as it balances ‘ the needs of a diverse community			0
’ @entity6 monitors photos , but also relies on its users to report content they feel should be removed			1
if a photo is under investigation it may be temporarily removed while @entity6 looks into the complaint but will be reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code .			1

hostage @entity63 , which has @entity33 's brother as trustee , slams the move
