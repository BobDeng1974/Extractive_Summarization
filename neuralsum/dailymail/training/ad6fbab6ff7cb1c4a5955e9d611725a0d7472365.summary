by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:01 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 4 april 2013 chief constable @entity3 has spoken of his ' disappointment ' after one of his officers began legal action to seek damages from a petrol station owner after she reportedly tripped on a kerb while attending a suspected break - in the policewoman suing a garage boss after tripping over a kerb was publicly humiliated by her own chief constable yesterday			1
@entity15 chief @entity3 said the actions of @entity18 @entity17 had undermined the public ’s trust in the police			1
her claim is a ‘ disappointment ’ , he insisted , and does not represent the attitude of the ‘ vast majority ’ of officers			1
mr @entity3 was under pressure to discipline @entity28 as critics said her personal injury claim ‘ brought discredit ’ on his force			1
she was last night considering abandoning the claim after talks between senior officers and her @entity37 representatives			1
mr @entity3 made it clear he does not support @entity28 , who is on sick leave over an unrelated medical problem			1
he said : ‘ this does n’t typify the attitude and behaviour of police officers either in @entity15 or nationally			2
‘ i ’ve got hundreds of officers who perform first - class work across the county , responding to hundreds of thousands of calls a year			2
‘ so it is a disappointment to us and i do understand why it has caused such a public reaction			2
‘ in 27 - and - a - half years in the service , this is the first time i have ever personally come across a set of circumstances like that			0
‘ the vast majority of officers perform their work brilliantly well , they are aware of the risks , and in fact many people are attracted by the risk and the variety of a police career			0
it is surprising and disappointing i think for the majority of our staff that an incident like this has undermined confidence in how we do our job			0
’ @entity28 , a divorced mother - of - two , remains in hiding at her parents ’ home in @entity80 , @entity15			1
@entity18 @entity17 , left , is suing burglary victim @entity81 , right , after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage , pictured , while investigating a break - in she triggered the row by asking a top @entity87 law firm to sue a garage owner after she fell over a 6ins kerb while answering a midnight call			1
the officer hurt her wrist and leg and hopes to receive compensation after her lawyers accused @entity81 of failing to ensure his premises was ‘ reasonably safe ’			0
the businessman , who is not related to her , has passed her claim to his insurers and fears his premium may rise as a result			0
a former colleague of @entity28 said : ‘ we do not know how serious her injuries were			1
but she was certainly able to finish her shift			0
’ further questions also remain over the role of the @entity37 in brokering the civil legal action by one of its members			1
the national federation pointed the finger at the branch which represents constables , while local representatives said they simply passed paperwork to lawyers			0
but yesterday the @entity121 revealed frontline officers are receiving millions of pounds every year from personal injury claims from a @entity37 - backed service			1
lawyers behind the free claimline boast they have recovered £ 42million in the last two years alone after suing over slips and trips , workplace accidents and negligence			0
@entity131 , @entity15 ’s police and crime commissioner , said @entity28 ’s behaviour was ‘ appalling ’ and ‘ leaves me cold ’			2
@entity28 tripped while investigating the break in at the @entity135 in @entity80 , @entity15			2
owner @entity81 said it is example of the ' fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident ' he said : ‘ of course , there are officers who deserve to receive help when they are injured in the course of duty and the public would readily support this			0
@entity28 , i suspect , is not one of them			2
’ @entity150 , @entity151 mp for @entity15 , called on the home secretary to ‘ get a grip ’ of the situation immediately			0
he said : ‘ will a firefighter sue because they do n’t like flames or a paramedic because they ca n’t stand blood ? this threatens the fabric of our emergency services			0
‘ the public need to know they can have confidence that the police will investigate a crime without trying to sue them			0
’ @entity169 , left , chairman of the @entity171 home affairs committee , has demanded urgent @entity173 guidelines while @entity15 mp @entity174 , right , said the @entity80 case was unacceptable			1
