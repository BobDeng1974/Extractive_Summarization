by @entity0 rough sleepers are being given $ 300 cameras to wear to expose what it is like being homeless			1
the footage is then uploaded to the web - revealing the masses of people who avoid eye contact and walk quicker when they see someone begging in the street			1
volunteer @entity11 , 44 , began the project by standing outside a supermarket in @entity14 and pleading : ' it 's my birthday tomorrow '			1
pictured : former drug addict @entity11 , 44 ignored : mr @entity11 stood outside a supermarket and begged , pleading : ' it 's my birthday tomorrow ' but as several hours passed almost no one stopped or even looked at him			1
eventually the footage shows passers - by donating money and , as the day draws to a close , two women buy him a hot meal			1
the moving video is accompanied by the story of mr @entity11 's life , which has seen him sleeping on the streets regularly for 30 years after his mother and wife died and he became a drug addict			1
drug - free for the last four years , he met the founders of the @entity20 project in january and hopes to be the first of a long line of homeless people wearing the cameras			1
but this week he had all his teeth surgically extracted , making him even more unapproachable in the eyes of some			0
shunned : most of the passers - by avoid making eye contact			1
mr @entity11 claimed people are losing social skills mr @entity11 said : ' in the last five years i 've probably known 100 normal everyday working people who become homeless			2
about half of them lose their friends - their family treats them differently ' the volunteers have the high - definition video cameras fixed to their chests and the footage is picked up later by the project 's organisers and uploaded to @entity69			2
mr @entity11 said : ' i notice every day that people are losing their compassion and their empathy , not just for homeless people but for society in general			2
' i feel technology has changed so much where people are emailing and do n't talk face to face any more that people are losing their social skills , their compassion , their empathy and their feeling of real life			0
' in the last five years i 've probably known 100 normal everyday working people who become homeless			2
about half of them lose their friends - their family treats them differently			0
' everyone asks " why did you end up on the streets ? " but not everyone realises homelessness is a product of society '			2
donation : a man gives money to mr @entity11 as he begs outside the supermarket			2
co-founder of the project @entity95 , 29 , said he was inspired to start the work after his uncle was homeless for 30 years @entity99 : two women bring a hot meal to the man after he has been begging outside the store organisers plan to enlist several more of @entity14 's 6,500 homeless people			1
co-founder of the project @entity95 , 29 , told @entity108 he was inspired to start the work after a family tragedy			0
project : @entity95 and @entity11 ' my uncle @entity112 was homeless for about 30 years , ' he said			1
' he had schizophrenia and died about 10 years ago			0
' i visited his grave for the first time at @entity117 and i felt there were many other people still living in @entity112 's situation whose stories had n't been told			0
' a $ 300 high - definition camera is usually reserved for extreme sports and weekend adventures so it 's surprising for it to give us a window into the lives of people we 're not usually tuned into			1
' @entity11 's a brilliant human being who has been on the streets for the same amount of time as my uncle @entity112			1
' they wear the cameras for a few hours and are really just going about their normal days			0
the purpose is to build empathy because that 's a very powerful force connecting people together			0
' it 's what we all probably experience - there 's a lot of implicit rejection where people just turn their shoulder away			0
' but then there are brief moments of humanity , when someone buys him lunch or gives him a few dollars or even just stops to say hi			0
' he added : ' we chose not to conceal the cameras for the reason that some people may object to having surreptitious videos being taken of them			0
but most people seemed to act as they would when seeing any homeless person			0
