in the fight against obesity , counting up the calories in every chip , biscuit or stick of celery can be a faff too far			0
however , a @entity9 company claims to have developed a smart wristband that does the adding up for you - by measuring changes in the glucose levels and liquid in the skin cells			1
the @entity19 wristband is the latest twist in the wearable technology revolution , most of which is built on a theme of improving health			1
the wristband uses an algorithm that analyses data collected by three sensors , designed to monitor changes in the body through the skin it was designed by a team of @entity27 - based developers and product managers led by @entity29 and @entity30			1

these sensors monitor changes in the body through the skin as people go through their day , walking , eating , sitting and sleeping			2

there is a pulse sensor which measures blood flow and heart rate , plus an accelerometer which measures body movement and activity , such as the number of steps taken			0
the third is called a bioimpedance sensor , which the company claims can give a good measure calorie intake			1
the theory is that when people eat , carbohydrates are turned into glucose or sugar in their blood			1
cells absorb the glucose and use it for energy , displacing liquid in the process			1
the bioimpedance sensor measures this change using patented software to translate this into the number of calories consumed , which are shown on the band ’s screen			2

as well as coming up with a figure for calorie intake , the other information collected by the sensors gives a total for calories burned , which allows the wearer to see whether they have done enough to lose weight during the day			1
the information on the pulse is used to deliver a stress level measure , while the device can also measure whether you have slept soundly or been tossing and turning through the night			0
while the theory sounds remarkable and useful , there are questions about whether there is sound science to back up the calorie count claims			2
the device initially launched on @entity134 , and raised more than $ 1 million dollars - 10 times its target			0
following the launch of the campaign , doctors and nutritionists disputed the claims made by mr @entity29 , saying that even if the sensors could accurately measure the energy changes , it would n't be a reliable guide to calorie intake			1
at this week 's @entity148 , @entity147 reporter @entity146 was given the opportunity to test the company 's claims			2

this is then shown on the band ’s screen and app ( pictured )			0
the other information collected by the sensors gives a total for calories burned , letting users compare the figures during the test , mr @entity146 ate half a cheese and turkey sandwich ( 125 calories ) , a small @entity183 ( 220 calories ) , and drank a bottle of apple juice ( 210 calories ) , giving a total of 555			2
the wristband started adding up the calories after 15 minutes and following an experiment lasting two and half hours , it came up with a figure of 515 calories			0
the @entity9 manufacturer , @entity198 , said the science behind the wristband has been verified by studies			0
an independent report , published in september , gave an accuracy rating of 84 per cent to 93 per cent - but only involved five volunteers			0
if that error margin is correct , the wristband , which will go on sale through the company ’s website later this year with a $ 299.99 ( £ 196 plus international postage ) , may be of limited use for calorie counting			2
the device initially launched on @entity134 , and raised more than $ 1 million dollars , but was soon criticised by doctors and nutritionists while the theory sounds remarkable and useful , there are questions about whether there is sound science to back up the calorie count claims			2
