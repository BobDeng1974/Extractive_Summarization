by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:58 pm on 2nd november 2011 crippling defence cuts have left the @entity3 without a single warship dedicated to protecting the waters around the @entity6			1
for the last month the stretched @entity7 has been unable to deploy a frigate or destroyer whose sole task is to patrol the country ’s coastline			2
typically , the @entity7 would place a vessel - known as the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) - on standby to respond swiftly to a potential threat such as a terrorist attack in @entity3 waters or abroad			1
but controversial cuts to the beleaguered fleet and the @entity22 conflict meant naval chiefs were forced to axe the emergency capability at the start of october			1
worrying : cutbacks have left the @entity3 without a single warship tasked with protecting the coastline - the last ship to undertake this role was the type 23 frigate @entity32 it has raised serious concerns that @entity3 ’s defences are at risk because of the gap in firepower			1
admiral lord @entity39 , the former @entity39 , said : ‘ if there was a terrorism incident in @entity3 waters , this would historically be the ship sent in to deal with it			1
‘ it ’s a big problem			2
if we have n’t got a ship ready to do this role then it ’s worrying			1
it ’s a very unsatisfactory position to be in			2
‘ what it shows is that the number of frigates and destroyers we ’ve got now is insufficient			2
we need more ships as a matter of urgency			2
’ in last year ’s @entity57 ( @entity57 ) the @entity56 cut the number of frigates or destroyers in the @entity7 ’s surface fleet from 24 to 19			2
critics warned the cuts would leave the navy overstretched			2
since march nine warships have been deployed to @entity22 to join operations to topple @entity66			1
but the war dragging on has left none left to be on hand in the @entity3			1
concerned : former @entity39 , admiral lord @entity39 , says it is worrying if a ship is not available to protect the country 's shores it is understood the last time the @entity7 did not protect ‘ home waters ’ was in 1982 after every available ship left for the @entity77			1
the last ship to undertake the high readiness role was the type 23 frigate @entity32			1
however , it left the position on october 3 to take part in the joint warrior @entity84 exercise off @entity86 which provides vital training for ships ’ crews			1
major general @entity90 , former commanding officer of @entity91 and a @entity93 veteran , said : ‘ this demonstrates how sea - blind the government has become - they do n’t seem to realise we live on an island			2
‘ the first duty of the @entity7 is to defend the @entity6 and yet it has n’t got enough ships to do so			0
‘ some people might say , " well , we ’re not under attack			0
but if we stay unprotected too often for too long someone might decide to run some guns , or smuggle drugs or ship over a few terrorists			1
it really makes your jaw drop			0
’ the @entity111 said the next @entity15 vessel would be formally notified by the end of the week			1
but with the @entity111 being forced to make cuts of £ 4.7billion by 2015 , as well as eliminate an equipment overspend of £ 38billion , there are fears that the high - alert ship will be ditched more frequently in future			2
earlier this year the head of the @entity7 was hauled over the coals by prime minister @entity122 for warning that the @entity3 ’s defences would be at risk if the war in @entity22 dragged on beyond september - a stance that has proved correct			1
admiral sir @entity127 , the @entity39 , said warships patrolling ‘ home waters ’ around the @entity6 may have to be diverted to the @entity130 to shore up @entity3 ’s war effort			1
at the peak of the conflict , @entity3 had five warships - destroyer @entity134 , mine clearance vessel @entity136 , a @entity138 , helicopter carrier @entity139 and supply vessel @entity141 - off the @entity22 coast			1
sir @entity127 said that beyond september ‘ we might have to request the government to make some challenging decisions about what priorities they want			0
the government will have a choice as to where they chose to take the platform from - it could be from around home waters			2
’ the @entity111 said that as well as the high readiness ship , the @entity7 normally has a frigate escorting the @entity157 nuclear deterrent and others protecting fishing vessels			1
a spokesman said : ‘ due to the successful deployment of @entity164 units to the @entity22 campaign it has been necessary to re-profile the tasks of some ships			1
‘ @entity3 waters remain well protected as at any one time there are always a number of @entity7 ships conducting security operations			1
should a ship be required for a counter-terrorist operation , for example , a @entity7 ship would be allocated immediately			2
’ asked why there has not been a @entity15 since @entity32 , an @entity111 spokesman said : ‘ we do not need one currently			0
we ’ve got ships off @entity22 and they are returning now			1
we ’ve had to look after our priorities and be flexible			0
we are doing the best with what we have got			0
’ the government has been warned that service personnel are ' hurting ' because of redundancies and cuts as further details of a scheme to boost support for the armed forces were revealed			0
defence minister @entity193 announced that more than £ 423,000 had been allocated to 13 bids in @entity195 for local projects funded through the community covenant scheme			0
the projects range from money for a play area to a grant for @entity195 lessons for @entity202 and funding for @entity204 to help commemorate the town 's new @entity206 status			0
the £ 30 million grant scheme was launched earlier this year and aims to reinforce the military covenant spelling out the bond between the nation and the armed forces			0
but @entity213 , chairman of the @entity214 , warned of the impact of redundancies and cuts to allowances on service personnel			0
she told a @entity219 ( @entity220 ) conference in @entity222 discussing the covenant that many were ' keeping their heads down ' in an attempt to avoid the next rounds of job cuts			0
' families are hurting and actually the covenant does n't mean a great deal to those who have just received a redundancy notice , ' she said			0
@entity233 , from @entity234 , @entity235 , criticised the government over cuts to allowances			0
the former warrant officer in the @entity240 , who is a @entity242 councillor , accused the government of paying for a doubling of the operational allowance in @entity246 through cuts to education and disruption allowances			0
' i find it very disappointing that the minister wants to take all the credit for the doubling of the operational allowance when they have cut other allowances to pay for it , ' he said			0
he told mr @entity193 : ' if you want local councils to sign up for this scheme , central government should put its money where its mouth is			0
' mr @entity193 said the armed forces deserved to be properly remunerated			0
' we have to balance the absolutely correct payment of continuity of education allowance to people who need it with the needs of the public purse , ' he said			0
' that is also true of other allowances , that we have to ensure that we are not overly - generous at a time when actually outside the armed forces people are in a pretty difficult situation			0

at least one ship is normally at readiness for an emergency in @entity3 waters or abroad
@entity84 *mission* to @entity22 also given as reason why protective vessel could not be deployed
former @entity39 says *development* is ' worrying '
