when @entity2 sensationally defected to the @entity3 last week , @entity1 leader @entity0 claimed his party had been ' begging ' him to drop the mep after being ' increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months '			1
but @entity7 can reveal the party was warned about his links with a convicted criminal a year ago – months before he was elected to the @entity11			1
local activists urged @entity1 chairman @entity13 to investigate claims mr @entity2 ' was joined at the hip ' to @entity15 - a former @entity1 spokesman who was forced to resign from the party when it emerged he had masterminded a £ 56,000 kidnapping plot in @entity18			1
despite this , the party selected mr @entity2 as a candidate and he was elected @entity5 in may			1
mr @entity2 's defection to the @entity3 last week triggered an immediate damage limitation exercise by @entity1 , which announced mr @entity2 had been suspended pending an investigation into ' extremely serious ' allegations			2
these included questions over his ' continued affiliation with @entity15 , despite the party 's protests against mr @entity15 's involvement with mr @entity2 or @entity1 ' , as well as his ' finances ' and his alleged interference in a candidate selection processes			1
mr @entity0 even said that @entity5 in his party had been ' begging me to get rid of @entity2 in october and november of last year ' and were ' increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months '			1
mr @entity2 dismissed @entity1 's response as a ' desperate attempt ' to smear him and insists there is ' not a shred of truth ' to the claims			1
allegations : @entity1 leader @entity0 ( right ) claimed his party had been ' begging ' him to drop @entity2 ( left ) after being ' increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months ' distanced : upon mr @entity2 's ( pictured ) defection to the @entity63 , @entity1 announced he had been suspended pending an investigation into ' extremely serious ' allegations but last night , former @entity1 mep @entity66 said the leaked emails revealed the party hierarchy knew there were questions over his conduct well before mr @entity2 was appointed as @entity1 candidate for the @entity11			1
he added mr @entity13 should resign as he had been ' dishonest ' in his @entity74 said : ' i am making no criticism of @entity1 or @entity0			1
this is about one man 's dishonesty			0
i believe @entity13 should resign			0
' on february 6 , 2014 , worried party members wrote to mr @entity13 after @entity15 was unmasked as the boss of a gang who kidnapped a @entity18 businessman 's son in @entity85 in 2004			0
@entity15 was later convicted in the @entity86			0
the email to mr @entity13 said : ' these two have been joined at the hip from the day they joined the party			0
@entity15 refers to @entity92 as uncle … @entity94 must have known @entity15 's past and his convictions			0

' finally it questioned whether the pair were ' conservative plants ' , after it was revealed mr @entity15 was formerly a @entity3 member			2
mr @entity13 apparently investigated some claims and responded to activists on march 2 saying : ' as i understand it , @entity15 is not related to @entity2 , but has been involved with him in a business context			2
mr @entity2 tells me he did not know of @entity15 's conviction before i raised it with him			2
