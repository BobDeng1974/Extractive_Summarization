by @entity0 hospitals will no longer be able to profit simply by putting dying patients on the @entity3			1
@entity5 trusts have been receiving six - figure sums for using the controversial end - of - life regime			1
but care minister @entity8 said these ‘ bribes ’ would have to stop unless it was shown suffering had been reduced			1
it is feared the incentives pressure doctors to use the pathway even when a patient ’s life may not be nearing its end			0
hospitals will no longer be able to reap financial bonuses by putting patients on the @entity3 , a scheme that governs the treatment of the seriously ill. file picture freedom of information requests show @entity23 , in @entity3 , received £ 308,000 last year for achieving ‘ goals including the @entity3 ’			1
part of the money was tied to it achieving an @entity3 figure of 43 per cent against a target of 35 per cent			1
@entity30 had lcp - linked payments halved for failing to hit targets			1
mr @entity8 , who has commissioned a review of the pathway , said payments should be made only if it can be demonstrated that individual patients have experienced reduced suffering as a direct result of being placed on the @entity3			1
‘ if incentives are given just to add someone to a list , that seems to be of concern , ’ he said			0
‘ i want the issue of payments to be looked at in the review , but in the meantime , let ’s ensure we only pay incentives when it can really be demonstrated that care at the end of life is being improved			1
’ every year 130,000 people are placed on the pathway , which aims to ease suffering			1
it usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs , and in some cases the removal of tubes providing nutrition and fluids			0
yesterday mr @entity8 named health expert @entity65 as chairman of the independent review			0
her inquiry will make recommendations about any changes needed to ensure patients are always treated with dignity and that they and their families are involved in decision - making			2
it will look at the experience and opinions of patients and families ; the experience and opinions of health professionals ; complaints against hospitals ; local payments made to hospitals in respect of @entity3 ; and the literature about the benefits and limitations of the pathway			1
@entity65 , former chief executive of the @entity94 health think - tank , used to sit in the @entity95 as a @entity96 but is now a crossbencher and is also a senior rabbi to the @entity99			2
she said : ‘ how we care for people at the end of their lives is a reflection of our society ’s values and civilisation			2
mr @entity8 called some aspects of the @entity3 , such as patients not getting food and drink , ' deeply disturbing ' ‘ at its best , @entity112 leads the world in end - of - life care , but it is not always perfect , and we need to work hard to get it right for everyone , providing the personal care individuals and their families both want and need			1
’ mr @entity8 said : ‘ she will be scrupulously independent and she brings a faith perspective to the consideration of this			0
‘ she will be supported by a panel of people ; independent experts and other people from faith perspectives			0
there is deep concern , for example , among the @entity133 perspective			0
’ the @entity96 minister said there would be a specific session of the review which would question families about their experiences			2
medical experts – both those for and against – would also appear			0
he said : ‘ i have been deeply troubled by some of the stories that have been reported to me about the experiences in some hospitals			2
it is impossible to know the scale			0
‘ i am deeply concerned about the apparent misapplication of @entity3 guidelines in some hospitals			1
‘ why it is that in many hospitals , patients are being denied food or drink , even though the guidelines say this should not happen ? it is deeply disturbing and needs to be properly understood and investigated			2
‘ i will act on any rational conclusions that come from the review			0
we have the chance to get to a great conclusion , where we can genuinely improve the quality of care at the end of life			0
‘ it is critical that food and drink is not withdrawn , unless to give food and drink would cause unnecessary suffering			0
i have heard stories of people who are compos mentis being denied liquids – and this is deeply disturbing			0
’ one leading critic of the @entity3 , hospital consultant professor @entity176 , attacked incentive payments last year			1
he said : ‘ given the fact that the diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one , putting a financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea			0
