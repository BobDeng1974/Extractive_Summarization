they might be known for working together in complex colonies , but woodland ants can be quite antisocial			0
the insects are able to fire smelly acid into the air to ward off predators and now , their offensive behaviour has been caught on camera			2
@entity10 ants work together to jointly squirt foul - smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead – such as a hungry bird			1
anti-social behaviour : woodland ants ( pictured ) are able to fire acid into the air to ward off predators			2
the insects work together to jointly squirt foul - smelling liquid when they sense at threat over head - such as a hungry bird @entity23 squirts : in order to trigger the insect 's reaction , the photographer gave the ant 's nest a tap , which prompted the insects to squirt the acid in the air from their tiny abdomens ( pictured ) formica rufa - also known as woodland ants and horse ants - are native to @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 in woodland and parkland			1
worker ants are red and brownish black and measure between 4.5mm and 9mm in length			0
they can spray formic acid from their abdomens in defence , like many other species of ants			1
nests are often built against rotting wood in the sun and colonies can have between 100,000 and 400,000 workers plus 100 queens			0
at their largest they can measure several metres in height and diameter			0
the creatures are aggressively territorial and attack and remove rival ant species in their patch			1
nuptial flights - an important phase in the reproduction of most ant , termite and some bee species - take place in the springtime and are often marked by fierce battles between neighbouring colonies			0
wood ants typically have multiple nests so they can move around in case of drastic changes in the environment			0
the formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar			2
however , it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds , who could wreak havoc on an ant nest			0
@entity10 ants live in the @entity40 as well as other parts of @entity39			1
their aggressive behaviour was captured by @entity98 , 43 , a wildlife photographer , who found a colony of the ants on a log in @entity101 , @entity102			1
in order to trigger the insect ’s reaction , he gave their nest a tap , which prompted the ants to squirt acid in the air from their tiny abdomens			2
‘ there are many different species of woodland ants in @entity40 and these are called @entity116 , ’ said mr @entity98 , who lives in @entity112 , @entity102			1
‘ as a defence mechanism they squirt formic acid which smells a bit like salt and vinegar crisps or fish and chips , ’ he explained			1
‘ if you put your hand an inch or two away from the nest they will squirt the acid to try and drive anything away			0
the ants ' aggressive behaviour was captured by @entity98 , 43 , a wildlife photographer , who found a colony of the ants on a log in @entity101 , @entity102			1
he carefully provoked them to see how they worked together to squirt streams of smelly acid upwards ( pictured left and right ) woodland ants ( pictured ) are the largest native ant species of the @entity40 and are known to be aggressively territorial			1
they often attack and remove other ant species from the area ‘ it does n't hurt but it stinks and i imagine if it was to get in your eyes it would probably sting			2
’ in order to capture the action , he set up his camera on a tripod , ensuring the sun was behind the ants , which had built a nest on a log			0
‘ i then tapped the log and lifted my hand up and started taking photographs , ’ he said			0
‘ i did n't see it when they were squirting the acid but when i looked back at the images , the sun had captured the droplets			0
’ formic acid is used as a preservative and antibacterial agent on animal food , tanning leather , dying textiles , and in the making of rubber			2

the tiny ants ' *incredible* behaviour was captured on camera in @entity101 , @entity102 , by wildlife photographer @entity98
they squirt formic acid from their abdomens , which smells like vinegar , to ward off hungry birds such as woodpeckers and jays
