’ @entity122 : ‘ a very serious allegation , of sex with a minor , was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a @entity69 court			0
the earlier statement categorically rejected that claim ; and as was indicated at the time , we do not intend to comment further			2
’ saturday evening : in response to specific claims about @entity8 ’s alleged conduct : ‘ it is emphatically denied that the @entity8 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity66			2

@entity182 and @entity1 fell out so no further money was ever transferred			1
at the time , the duke 's office repeatedly refused to comment on suggestions that he brokered a deal , but the @entity0 admitted that @entity8 ' and his office ' – four staff funded by the @entity42 – had been ' more than marvellous ' and ' sorted out my debts '			1
in an interview with @entity196 , then editor of the @entity197 , in 2011 , the duchess later attempted to shoulder the blame on behalf of her ex-husband and claimed her judgment had been ' clouded ' by her desperation to get out of £ 5million debts			1

allegations : prince @entity8 pictured with @entity66 and @entity146 , right , in 2001 ' i abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf			1
' i am just so contrite i can not say			0
whenever i can i will repay the money and will have nothing ever to do with @entity1 ever again ... ' the duke is a man who does not know how to tell an untruth or behave dishonourably			1
there have been errors of judgment but nothing substantive has been done wrong by him , ever ... ' he is a first - rate father ; he 's a first - rate man , the finest that i know			2
i will not have his name tarnished by me yet again			0
look at all that he has done for the country			0
' she equated the gravity of her latest error with her cataclysmic fall from grace in the preceding may , when she was secretly recorded taking £ 27,000 in cash from undercover reporters in return for guaranteed access to @entity8			1
she said : ' once again my errors have compounded and rebounded and also inadvertently impacted on the man i admire most in the world , the duke			0
' he has supported me and come to my rescue again and again and there is absolutely nothing that i would not do for him			0
' it is in times of difficulty that character shows itself			0
i am fiery @entity246 redhead and i am to remain strong , fight strong and try to do what is right			0
