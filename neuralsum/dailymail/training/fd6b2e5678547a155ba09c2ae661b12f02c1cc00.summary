by @entity0 tough ? @entity2 's @entity1 signalled a toughening of opposition stance @entity6 's three main parties were on a collision course with @entity8 last night after they all backed plans to limit migrants ’ benefits – in defiance of the @entity13			1
work and pensions secretary @entity14 said migrants should not be able to obtain welfare payments until they had been in the @entity6 for two years – eight times the current limit of three months			1
and @entity2 ’s @entity1 signalled a toughening of the opposition ’s stance , calling for them to receive handouts only if they had paid into the system first as taxpayers			1
even deputy prime minister @entity24 said it was ‘ eminently sensible ’ to work with other @entity27 nations to tighten the rules			1
but the growing consensus that the free movement of labour had gone too far was rejected by @entity27 employment commissioner @entity32 called the proposed two - year limit ‘ a problem ’ that would violate @entity27 rules			2
the government has enshrined the current three - month limit in law after advice from its lawyers			0
but mr @entity14 revealed that he is already talking to @entity6 ’s allies , including @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44 , about plans to dramatically extend it			1
he told the @entity53 : ‘ it could be a year , it could be two years			0
after that , then we will consider you a resident of the @entity6 and be happy to pay you benefits			2
’ he said migrants should ‘ demonstrate that you are committed to the country , that you are a resident and that you are here for a period of time and you are generally taking work and that you are contributing ’			2
far from criticising the government , miss @entity1 made clear that @entity2 now supports the ‘ contributory principle ’ on benefits – a posture that won her predecessor as mr @entity14 ’s shadow , @entity66 , criticism from some on the @entity2 left			1
mr @entity24 said it was ' eminently sensible ' for the government to ' come to an agreement that says you have to jump through certain hoops before you can claim benefits ' she said : ‘ it has got to be right that you only get something out of our social security system if you put something in			0
’ mr @entity24 told @entity81 on @entity82 it was ‘ eminently sensible ’ for the government to ‘ come to an agreement that says you have to jump through certain hoops before you can claim benefits ’			0
but mr @entity87 attacked politicians of all parties , branding them ‘ nasty ’ for the second time in a month and warning that @entity6 risks ‘ losing friends ’ if they continue with the same rhetoric			0
‘ we should n’t assume the @entity6 welfare system is a lot more generous than that of many other countries , ’ he said			0
a source close to mr @entity14 said : ‘ it ’s not the @entity6 that is isolated , it is the @entity13 that is isolated , sticking to rules that no longer command public support			0

opposition and @entity103 dems say migrants should be forced to wait for benefits
@entity2 's @entity1 says they must pay into system before taking benefits
@entity14 is talking to other @entity27 countries about *delaying* payments
