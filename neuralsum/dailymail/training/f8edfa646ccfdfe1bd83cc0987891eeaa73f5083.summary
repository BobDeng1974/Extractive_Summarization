by @entity1 reporter published : 08:07 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 9 june 2013 analysts at the @entity3 are able to secretly access real - time user data provided by as many as 50 @entity6 companies , ranging from credit rating agencies to internet service providers			1
according to two government officials familiar with the arrangements , several of the companies have provided records continuously since 2006 , while others have given the agency sporadic access			2
the officials disclosed the number of participating companies in order to provide context for a series of disclosures about the @entity3 's domestic collection policies			2
many of the details are unveiled by @entity27 , co-author of a new book about government secrecy and surveillance , @entity31 : inside the @entity32			2
storage space : @entity3 's @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , where government records of citizen 's phone and internet usage could be kept ' the idea is to create a mosaic			0
we get a tip. we vet it			0
then we mine the data for intelligence , ' one of the officials said to @entity50			2
in a statement , director of national intelligence @entity51 said that programs collect communications ' pursuant to section 702 of the @entity57 , ' and ' can not be used to intentionally target any @entity6 citizen , any other @entity6 person , or anyone within the @entity6			1
' the @entity3 needs several different collection tools , of which @entity62 is one			1
@entity62 works well because it is able to handle several different types of data streams using different basic encryption methods			1
it is a ' front end ' system , or software , that allows an @entity3 analyst to search through the data and pull out items of significance , which are then stored in any number of databases			0
no knowledge : internet giant @entity77 said that it had never heard of the @entity62 scheme before reports broke last week from the different types of data , including their credit card purchases , the locations they sign in to the internet from , and even local police arrest logs , the @entity3 can track people it considers terrorism or espionage suspects in near - real time			1
an internet geo - location cell is on constant standby to help analysts determine where a subject logs in from			0
most of the collection takes place on subjects outside the @entity6 , but a large chunk of the world 's relevant communication passes through @entity6 companies with servers on @entity6 soil			2
what is more unclear is how the @entity3 interacts with the companies			0
computer giant : @entity107 also said that it had never heard of the @entity62 until now but reports say it has worked contributed to discussions with the government concerning sharing information several of the companies mentioned in past few days deny granting access to the @entity3			1
might be possibly be lying or is it that the @entity3 's arrangements with individual companies are kept so tightly that very few people know about it ? one official likened the @entity3 's collection authority to a van full of sealed boxes that are delivered to the agency			2
a court order permits the transfer of custody of the ' boxes			0
' however , the @entity3 needs something else , a specific purpose or investigation , in order to open a particular box			0
classified : the particulars of the @entity62 data - mining program have been outlined in a top - secret @entity134 presentation for senior intelligence analysts , which ended up being leaked participants : this graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined @entity62 , with @entity107 being the latest addition in october 2012 the chairman of the @entity143 intelligence committee , sen. @entity144 , said the standard was ' a reasonable , articulatable ' suspicion , but did not go into details			1
the @entity3 can collect and store trillions of bytes electronic information revealed by @entity6 citizens			0
in the government 's eyes , the data is simply moving from one place to another			0
it does not become , in the government 's eyes , relevant or protected in any way unless and until it is subject to analysis			0
bombshell : @entity3 and @entity161 have been extracting audio , video , photos , e-mails , documents and other data from @entity107 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity77 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 key source : @entity62 has been described by @entity3 officials ' as the most prolific contributor to the president 's @entity178 , ' providing analysts with a wealth of ' raw material ' a spokesperson for @entity107 also denied any knowledge of @entity62 's existence			1
it was claimed that the @entity188 companies involved in the prism program are @entity107 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity77 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and the lesser known internet company @entity174 , which has hosted a lot of traffic during the @entity193 and the on - going @entity195 civil war			1
however , only @entity168 and @entity77 have been shown to have worked toward creating ' online rooms ' in which to share data with the government			1
the wave of disclosures about the @entity3 programs have significantly unsettled the intelligence community			0
targets : the tech giants involved in involved in @entity62 are @entity107 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity77 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and the lesser known internet company @entity174 the documents obtained by the two newspapers are marked @entity208 , or originator controlled , which generally means that the agency keeps a record of every person who accesses them online and knows exactly who might have printed out or saved or accessed a copy			1
the @entity3 in particular has a good record of protecting its documents			0
the scope of the latest leak suggests that several people with top - level security clearances had to be involved			2
@entity51 said in his statement that the disclosures about the program ' risk important protections for the security of @entity6			0
' ' reprehensible ' : director of national intelligence @entity51 branded the program ' reprehensible ' and said it risks @entity6 ' security mining for data : the @entity3 has been getting millions of phone records from @entity234 on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order			1
