miss @entity7 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ' i do not want sympathy			1
i just wanted surgical help to get my life back and be the independent driven women i used to be , not being sick , in pain and stuck on benefits all my life			1
' wearing a hard collar is very uncomfortable , restrictive , and hot , but it allows me to get out of bed some days and sometimes it is the only indication that i am very sick			0
' the smallest journey is living hell , inflicting vibration and jarring to my body , so even hospital appointments are huge pain filled ordeals			0
clues : last year she was diagnosed with @entity11 due to her hypermobility			1
her super flexible limbs and the way she can put her hands flat on the floor without bending her legs confirmed it miss @entity7 said : ' i do not want sympathy			1
i just wanted surgical help to get my life back and be the independent driven women i used to be , not being sick , in pain and stuck on benefits all my life ' ' i ’ve had a headache for three years now and it just never gets better			2

@entity11 is caused by alterations in certain genes - these can be passed from parents to their children			2
the condition affects at least one person in every 5,000 in the @entity106			2
there are various different forms of @entity109 share some common features , such as loose joints , abnormal skin and fragile body tissues , but each form of @entity11 has unique characteristics too			2
the most severe form is @entity11 which causes the organs and blood vessels to be at risk of rupturing - this can be fatal			2
source : @entity121 her problems started at 23 when she began to suffer from symptoms associated with @entity19 and migraines			0
miss @entity7 also has type 1 diabetes doctors believed the two problems were linked			2
so she carried on with as normal a life as possible , setting up her own bridal make - up business , meeting a long - term boyfriend and getting engaged			0
at 26 she could no longer ignore the nausea and headaches that had come to accompany her stomach problems and returned to her doctors who diagnosed her with stress and dismissed her as a hypochondriac			0
it was only then , when she felt like no - one was taking her seriously , that she began to look elsewhere to solve the mystery of her health problems			0
things took a turn for the worse when she fell down a set of wooden steps a year later			0
suffering from severe whiplash , her migraines worsened and she began to find it difficult to track objects with her eyes			0
after spending thousands of pounds of her savings on tests and doctors , her diagnosis finally came at 29 with a simple test to see how flexible she was			0
@entity155 is one of the markers of @entity7 ’s type of @entity11 her super flexible limbs and the way she can put her hands flat on the floor without bending her legs confirmed it			1
she had always been more flexible than the average child , excelling at gymnastics at school , and had been able to pull her thumb in and out of its socket without any pain - but had thought it was normal			2
but her headaches remained unexplained			0
in desperation she went online and found a specialist clinic in @entity33 who , after seeing her mri scans , believe she also suffers from @entity26 linked to her @entity11 hope : miss @entity7 believes that a pioneering operation in the @entity33 could solve her problem by stopping fusing her skull to her spine to stop her head from pressing down any further this means her neck is not strong enough to hold up her head and her brain stem is slowly being crunched by the pressure from her skull			1
