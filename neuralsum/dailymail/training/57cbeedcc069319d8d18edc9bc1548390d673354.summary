fresh , green and innocent - looking , the neatly tied bunches of khat found in markets across the @entity3 look far from dangerous			1
but , as these photographs reveal , that is exactly what they are			0
banned in the @entity12 earlier this year , khat , a narcotic green leaf which produces a sense of euphoria in users , is a common sight on the streets of @entity16 capital @entity17 as well as other cities in the region			1
but with side - effects that include mouth disease , tooth loss and , in some cases , mental illness , the drug takes a terrible toll on addicts , which in some cases , include children as young as six years old			1
' the children follow their parents ’ lead and end up addicted at an early age			0
' and the consequences of that addiction can be severe , whether being left penniless and unable to work or falling victim to drug - related mania			0
for those who do succumb to madness induced by khat , a life chained inside their homes awaits - psychologists and mental health institutions being in short supply in @entity16 , @entity39 and @entity77			1
more still fall victim to gang violence - usually as a result of being unable to pay for their khat , which costs between $ 0.5 and $ 20 for a bunch , depending on the quality and freshness of the leaves			1
other khat addicts turn out to be a danger to others			1
' the stimulant properties of khat are commonly believed to improve efficiency , so it ’s common to see laborers chewing while working , ' explains @entity59			0
' like alcohol ' : @entity16 users such as this man say that using the drug is their equivalent of drinking alcohol high : people high on the drug can be spotted courtesy of their enlarged pupils and erratic behaviour ca n't stop : for many , chewing khat takes over their lives - with some starting to chew the drug in childhood big business : khat farming is worth £ 160m a year in @entity39 alone , which counts the drug as its fourth largest export popular : as well as @entity77 , @entity114 , @entity16 and @entity39 , khat is also popular in @entity115 and @entity116 , where it is known as miraa ' the same goes goes for taxi and bus drivers but they often cause accidents when they fall asleep at the wheel after the euphoria fades			1
' but with an estimated 20 million users in the @entity3 alone , khat has become a big business - and one that shows no signs of slowing , thanks to the 500,000 farmers across the @entity3 and @entity129 turning their land over to the drug			1
unlike coffee , khat can be harvested twice a year and requires 30 per cent less water to grow - a key consideration in @entity16 , which , according to hydrologists , is in danger of becoming the first country in the world to run out of fresh water			2
but with so much of the local economy dependent on khat , any change to demand can prove disastrous			0
already , says @entity59 , the effects of the @entity12 ban are beginning to be felt in @entity39			1
' for thousands of little farmers and traders in @entity39 , the ban has already had a severe impact , ' says @entity59			2
' @entity150 was @entity39 's fourth largest export , bringing in more than £ 160m in 2013 alone			2
' painful : one of the nastiest side effects is tooth decay and mouth cancer , both of which this @entity77 addict has market leader : the 571 gang , which is thought to be led by a woman , is the market leader for khat sales attractive : many @entity39 women believe that chewing khat makes you more attractive to the opposite sex making money : more than 25,000kg of khat is sold each day in @entity39 's @entity170 alone tradition : in the tiny country of @entity174 , khat is still sold wrapped in traditional banana leaves rather than plastic bags busy : a khat market near the town of @entity40 in @entity39			1
from @entity40 , the drug is exported to destinations across the @entity129 but not everyone is suffering			2
for the 571 franchise based in @entity114 's capital , @entity185 , business continues much as it always has			0
the largest supplier in the region , it sells 80 tonnes of khat every single day			0
' they even own a plane to carry the khat to @entity39 or to the refugees camps [ in @entity16 , @entity194 and @entity195 ] , ' explains @entity59			1
' according to local legend , it is run by a woman who earns many millions of dollars a year from the drug			0
' but while the mystery woman behind the 571 franchise is benefiting from khat , for the millions of addicts living in the region , the future is considerably less secure			2
' many people are addicted to khat for life , ' says @entity59			0
' it has also had a huge effect on the environment because it is sold in plastic bags which litter the ground everywhere you go in @entity16 and @entity114			2
' outside of @entity17 , there are millions of plastic bags littered about			0
the government tried to stop people doing it but nothing ever seems to work			0
in @entity16 , you know you 're approaching a town when you start seeing plastic bags everywhere			0
' lucrative : there are an estimated 500,000 khat farmers across the @entity3 and the @entity129 different methods : in @entity16 , where the desert heat wilts the fresh khat leaves , the majority of markets take place at night cash crop : colourful plastic sheeting is used to protect a khat field close to the @entity16 town of @entity237 popular : this variant of khat , known locally as chami , is grown on the @entity16 - @entity242 border and is widely considered to be the best environmental problems : because khat is sold in plastic bags , suburbs are blighted with piles of discarded carriers			1
