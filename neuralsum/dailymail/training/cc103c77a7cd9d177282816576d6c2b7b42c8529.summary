by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 3 may 2013 painters have been left red - faced after using a ' glaring tomato ' shade instead of terracotta to repaint a @entity7 - listed @entity6 building			1
the bright hue has left drivers ' dazzled ' after passing the @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12 and the council has been inundated with complaints			1
the @entity10 annexe in @entity16 , has been given a paint job in a shade of ' tomato red ' locals were horrified by the sight of the newly decorated red rooftop now , the decorators must put scaffolding back up to repair the 40ft - high building , now converted to flats			2
the former hospital annexe - built in 1877 to celebrate @entity30 @entity29 's @entity28 - is considered one of @entity11 's finest pieces of @entity6 architecture			1
former glory : the @entity10 is considered to be one of @entity11 's finest historic buildings locals have said the flats are ' glaring tomato red ' , with some even saying the paint job has ' dazzled them ' while driving			1
accounts worker @entity42 , 37 , said : ' every time i drive past the building i get dazzled by the paint			2
' the first time i saw it i nearly swerved into another car - they really need to get it sorted soon			0
' the rules when redecorating or renovating listed properties are that any changes must be in keeping with the original character of the building			2
care must be taken to preserve and enhance the period features , by choosing the same materials that were used originally			0
@entity60 is needed for all kinds of work that involves alterations which affect the character of a listed building of special architectural or historic interest , which is determined by the local authority			0
if the property is in a conservation area , additional ' @entity68 ' apply , such as replacing a window with one of a similar design			0
for example , when replacing windows in a @entity6 house , wooden frames are more appropriate than @entity78			1
@entity79 , who has lived in @entity11 for more than 50 years , said : ' it 's one of our finest buildings , it survived the war but now look at it			1
' it looks absolutely ridiculous			0
what moron did it and thought it looked acceptable ? ' one high street businessman , who asked not to be named , took his objections to the @entity91 , which in turn took the matter up with the @entity94			0
he said : ' the painting work seems so unnecessary , as the brickwork painted over was in good condition in the first place			0
' bosses at @entity100 , which owns the flats , have admitted that workers failed to match the ' terracotta colour ' and that re-painting had been arranged			1
a spokesman said : ' when refreshing paintwork on the flats , the terracotta colour was n't matched correctly			1
' we have been working with the local planning department in response to enquiries , and have arranged for the building to be re-painted			0
' a spokesman for @entity114 said : ' we have spoken to the owners who have given us assurances that they will repaint the building a more acceptable colour in the very near future			2

the @entity122 annexe was built in 1877 to celebrate @entity30 @entity29 's @entity28
it is considered to be one of @entity11 's finest examples of @entity6 architecture
owners admit original terracotta colour ' was not matched correctly '
