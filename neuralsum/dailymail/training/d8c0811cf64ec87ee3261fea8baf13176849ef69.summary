captain @entity0 believes @entity1 now have the forward firepower to mount a long - overdue sustained assault on the @entity5 title			1
the manner in which the @entity8 winners saw off defending champions @entity9 in the @entity10 , albeit against a makeshift side , at @entity12 has given hope @entity15 's men can finally last the distance through to may 2015 for what would be a first championship in more than a decade			1
@entity15 strengthened the @entity1 squad with the £ 30million summer addition of @entity21 forward @entity22 from @entity23 , while the arrival of @entity26 international @entity25 from @entity27 offset the loss of @entity29 , who joined @entity9 on a free transfer			1
' attacking-wise this season , we are going to be more different and we are going to have more of a surprise factor , ' @entity0 told @entity56			1
' ( @entity22 ) looks very good			0
he has got pace , that special technique , his feet are so , so quick			0
' he is a bit cheeky on the pitch , and got those runs , that movement , is always on the shoulder of a defender and he wants to score goals			0
@entity22 has the right attitude here - very humble			0
' he is going to do well - i think the fans are very excited and i think they are right because we have signed some player here			0
' victorious : @entity0 holds aloft the @entity10 after @entity1 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity9 @entity0 , appointed as permanent club captain following the sale of @entity77 to @entity23 , added : ' i am very impressed with @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
he 's got great feet , great technique , is very creative and he 's a young lad who is full of energy and is enthusiastic			0
' he wants to stay here , wants to make his stamp here and i think the boss is going to give him a chance			0
' @entity15 indicated he would like to bring in another defender to cover @entity77 's departure , the @entity90 international heading to the @entity91 for more first - team opportunities			2
@entity1 have been linked with the likes of @entity94 captain @entity93 , @entity96 defensive midfielder @entity95 , @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity100 international @entity99			2
@entity101 joined in a £ 16million deal from @entity103 earlier in the summer and the 19 - year - old has produced some consistent displays during pre-season			1
@entity0 is confident there is more to come			2
' i am impressed by @entity101 's character , by how quickly he is adapting and how secure he is when he plays , ' said the @entity36			0
' he is mature , a normal guy and i think he is going to be a very important player for us in the next few years			0
' reward : @entity0 has been handed the captain 's armband at the @entity115 after proving to be a reliable performer @entity119 @entity118 - winning trio @entity117 , @entity120 and @entity121 have all returned to @entity1 's @entity123 training base			1
however , they are unlikely to be considered for the @entity37 ' @entity5 opener at home to @entity127 on saturday , with the first leg of the @entity133 play - off against @entity131 in @entity132 next week a possibility			2
@entity49 , who missed the @entity118 after suffering a serious knee problem in the @entity8 win over @entity135 in january , and @entity137 goalkeeper @entity136 , signed from @entity138 in the summer , have not been included in @entity1 's @entity140 squad list for the tie as they continue their respective recoveries from injury .			1

@entity0 has been confirmed as @entity1 's new captain
the 32 - year - old says his side have a ' surprise ' factor about them this season
the @entity37 were *excellent* as they beat @entity9 3 - 0 on *sunday*
