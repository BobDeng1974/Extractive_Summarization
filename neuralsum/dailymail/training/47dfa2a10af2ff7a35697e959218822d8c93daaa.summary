click here to read @entity2 's match report as a @entity4 goal was enough to hand the home side victory @entity6 made hard work of it after they scored			1
they looked to limp over the line and it was a far from convincing performance as they beat @entity14 1 - 0			1
perhaps the @entity17 result in the @entity18 last month was playing on their minds , during which they shipped two goals to draw 2 - 2			0
like that game , they lost momentum when they went ahead against @entity14 but this time they got away with it			2
they need to learn to finish teams off when they dominate			0
@entity6 lost momentum after @entity4 ( right ) put his side 1 - 0 ahead the young lad @entity31 switched off for the goal			1
when i was growing up , i was always told to get touch - tight to my man in the box and to always be slightly in front of the striker so i could match his movement			0
it ’s important @entity31 works on that			0
@entity14 youngster @entity31 must learn to get touch - tight on his opponent they may have lost but i can see improvement in @entity14			1
@entity44 is seen as an innovator , and his tactics were interesting in the first half			0
@entity48 dropped into defence while @entity50 came very deep to receive the ball			0
@entity52 tucked in and @entity53 occupied the right			0
@entity6 did not know how to deal with @entity14 when they had the ball			1
but the visitors were exposed on the flanks when they lost possession			0
the second half saw a gallant effort from @entity14 — going down to 10 men forced them to give more , especially @entity50			2
however , it will be a worry for @entity64 that @entity66 ’s work - rate did not match the rest of the team			2
@entity50 played well in a more withdrawn role upon his return from suspension @entity66 's ( right ) work - rate did not match the rest of the team around him people seem to be divided on @entity53			1
his former manager @entity76 is right when he says he carries a threat and he had a good all - round game against @entity6			1
but you have to take your chances and he fluffed his lines by missing that header			0
@entity84 midfielder @entity53 should have done better with his header it was vital city won this match , otherwise @entity89 could have had the title almost sewn up before @entity91			0
@entity6 might be the champions , but they are not playing like it at the moment			2
manager @entity94 will hope they can get their swagger back sooner rather than later			1
city boss @entity94 will know his side must improve if they are to catch @entity89			1

@entity6 made hard work of beating 10 - man @entity14
@entity4 scored only goal but champions @entity6 must improve
@entity44 's side are *slowly* starting to click despite loss
city manager @entity94 will know his team must improve
