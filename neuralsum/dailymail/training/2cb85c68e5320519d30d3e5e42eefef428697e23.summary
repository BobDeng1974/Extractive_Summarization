@entity1 's budget has led experts to question the definition of bread @entity1 's budget has left the taxman scratching his head after it prompted @entity7 to launch a public consultation to discover the exact definition of bread			1
last week the chancellor announced vat of 20 per cent will be extended to all hot takeaway foods such as pasties and pies which are ‘ above the ambient air temperature at the time they are provided to the customer ’			1
however , as bread is considered a basic food , it is not subject to @entity11 whether it is warmed in the oven or served cold			2
but bakers have pointed out there is no exact definition of bread			1
for example , is a croissant considered a type of bread ? or a hot - cross bun ? to find out , the government has launched a consultation which has even left retail experts puzzled			2
according to the consultation document : ' for a number of years , the borderline between hot takeaway food ( standard - rated ) and cold takeaway food ( zero - rated ) has been the subject of litigation , with some retailers arguing that the purpose of heating their food products is to improve their appearance or to comply with health and safety regulations , rather than to enable them to be consumed hot			2
' so , although many retailers and takeaway outlets charge vat on the sale of hot chicken products , hot pies and toasted sandwiches , some retailers and bakery chains sell similar products zero - rated			2
' use your loaf : bread is deemed a basic food and therefore not subject to vat @entity59 including @entity60 and @entity61 of @entity62 have in the past appealed against charges on hot food because they believe the products were not necessarily designed to be eaten hot			1
high street baker @entity66 has already threatened to take legal action if @entity7 tries to label its food as ' hot ' and subject to vat			1
a spokesman told the magazine , @entity72 : ' we do not believe that our freshly baked savoury products should be subject to vat and we will be making strong representation to the government regarding the proposed changes			0
' but mr @entity1 said the extension was among a number that were necessary to end anomalies			0
confusion : should croissants , scones and hot - cross buns be subject to vat ? his decision will raise an extra £ 125million this year and £ 350million a year by 2016			1
but it means 18p will be added to the price of a 90p hot sausage roll and 30p to a £ 1.49 pasty			0
@entity66 reported profits of more than £ 50million in both 2010 and 2011			0
the results were due in part to a rapid expansion that has seen the bakery chain increase its number of stores			0
it now boasts nearly 1,500 outlets in the @entity100 – more than @entity101			0
in 2009 , a study found that annual sales of pies nationwide had reached £ 941million .			0
