by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 31 may 2013 animal rights activists are poised to sabotage the controversial cull of thousands of badgers which is set to begin tonight			1
more than 5,000 badgers will be shot in west @entity5 and west @entity6 over a six - week period in an attempt stop the spread of @entity9 among cattle			1
badgers are blamed for spreading the disease to livestock , devastating herds and costing dairy farmers and the taxpayer millions of pounds a year			1
controversial : a cull of thousands of badgers in several @entity20 counties will begin tonight to stop the spread of @entity9 to cows @entity23 : @entity5 is one of the counties where some 5,000 badgers will be shot over a six week period ministers say that unless everything possible is done to control the disease , the bill to the country will top £ 1billion over the next decade			1
but critics favour other methods , including vaccination , and say that the science behind the cull is not sound			1
they warn that many animals will die a slow , painful death , after being maimed , rather than killed outright and say that studies have shown that killing badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease , rather than control it			1
rock star @entity43 has helped raise the opposition ’s profile and will today lead a march against the ‘ pointless slaughter ’			0
more extreme groups have pledged to sabotage the cull by using techniques from making noise to scare the badgers away to putting marksmen under citizen ’s arrest			1
famous opposition : @entity55 guitarist @entity43 will today lead a protest against the cull - he is pictured on a similar protest last autumn under the terms of the licenses for the culls , at least 70 per cent of the badgers must be killed during a six - week period between now and the start of february			1
the culling period is concentrated in this way to try to prevent the disease being spread by infected creatures fleeing into surrounding areas			1
the animals will be shot in fields by trained marksmen or killed after being caught in baited traps			1
no advance warning will be given of the start of the cull			2
some speculate it wo n’t start until crops are harvested and the tourist season is over			0
the alternative view is that an early start would stop tension from building further and deprive activists of preparation time			0
long - term , the strategy could cut the amount of @entity9 in the area by 16 per cent			0
the two pilot schemes are designed to show that the widespread shooting of badgers is safe and humane , as well as feasible			2
protest : an unknown animal - loving graffiti artist has hand drawn a graphic image of a rotting dead badger on a derelict building in @entity96 , @entity97 , in protest of the badger culling if successful , it could be extended to other bovine tb hotpots			0
a cattle vaccine is a decade away and while a jab for badgers exists , its administration is hugely time - intensive as each animal has to be caught and immunised individually			1
taking aim : the animals will be shot in fields by trained marksmen or killed after being caught in baited traps farming minister @entity112 told @entity113 ’s today programme : ‘ all the countries that have successfully dealt with this disease have employed a policy similar to ours			2
‘ what we ’re trying to see in these pilot culls is whether it can be done humanely , safely and efficiently			0
‘ if we have a comprehensive strategy we might be able to deal with this devastating disease			0
’ the @entity124 says that with the number of cases of bovine @entity9 exploding in recent years , a cull is the only option			2
@entity130 environment minister @entity129 described the cull as ‘ an untested and risky approach ’			2
she added : ‘ the policing costs , paid by the taxpayer , will balloon to £ 4million while bovine tb will increase over the next two years as the shooting displaces badgers			2
’ @entity138 , chief executive of the charity care for the @entity140 , said : ‘ the government and the @entity124 are blindly embarking on one of the worst agricultural policies of the last 30 years , which will lead to senseless slaughter , chaos and disruption in the countryside , huge cost to the taxpayer and no meaningful reduction in the spread of bovine tb			0
’ the @entity153 said it has already surveyed the cull site and has people in the area			0
more will be brought in as needed			0
spokesman @entity157 said the group will use bright lights and whistles to scare the badgers away but , if necessary , members will ‘ stand in front of the guns ’			0
the cull will be discussed in @entity166 on wednesday at a debate called by @entity168 .			0

more than 5,000 badgers will be shot over a six week period
badgers are blamed for spreading *tuberculosis* among cattle and livestock
