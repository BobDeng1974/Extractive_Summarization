by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 08:52 est , 27 november 2013 two mysterious safes that have lain unopened in a municipal building for at least a generation will be unlocked this month			2
the safes are in an old @entity6 vault that has been turned into a storage and file room			1
city officials say they were probably installed in the middle part of the last century , but they have no idea exactly when , or which mayor ordered their installation - or what is in them			1
two mysterious safes in an old @entity6 vault that has been turned into a storage and file room are to be opened and when newly - elected mayor @entity20 found them he was intrigued , and ordered them to be opened , @entity18 reported			1
@entity20 said he has spoken to former mayors @entity24 and @entity25 , who each said they knew nothing about the history of the safe and never tried to open it			2
' we do n't know when the safes were installed or what they were used for but they are quite old , ' @entity20 said			1
' none of the living mayors we spoke to recall them ever being opened or used			0
we thought it would be interesting to find out what may be inside and will have a professional open the safes			2
' @entity6 's political history makes you wonder why a safe - much less two - was installed in the mayor 's office			1
' among the colourful former mayors of @entity6 are @entity44 , who was known as ' the granddaddy of @entity46 ' and served from 1917 to 1947 , and @entity47 , who served from 1953 to 1957 and tried to ban rock and roll music from within the city limits			1
former city employees say the safes always had rumours around them , one being that @entity44 used them to store kickbacks received from city workers			1
@entity25 , who preceded @entity20 as mayor and served two terms , said he never gave the safes much thought and never tried to open them			1
as far as he knows , none of his predecessors did either			0
' i 've never been in the safe and i have no idea how far back it goes , ' @entity25 said			0
' i do n't think anybody 's been in it in years			0
that was from the good old days or ' bad ' old days when there was more money floating around city hall			0
' former mayor @entity24 , who served two non-consecutive terms in office first in the early 1980s and later in the early 1990s said he remembers the safes but has no idea what might be in them			1
he 's not sure if he opened either of them during his tenure , but if he did , it did n't leave an impression			0
' i do n't know if we opened them , i do n't remember			0
if we did , i do n't remember anything in it , ' @entity24 said			0
he said the safes were much like @entity44 's desk , which still sits in city hall			1
the desk , which has a two way drawer that opens outward to anyone facing its occupant – rumored to be @entity44 's preferred way to collect cash payouts – has been in use in the municipal building for the better part of a century			2
' everybody thought @entity44 's desk was a big deal , but i did n't want it , it was a ratty old desk , ' he said			2
@entity25 said , while definitely intriguing it 's probably not wise to go all @entity100 over them			0
' they 're probably empty , ' he said			0
' that 's my guess			0
' @entity20 said the city will contract a locksmith to open them sometime next month .			2
