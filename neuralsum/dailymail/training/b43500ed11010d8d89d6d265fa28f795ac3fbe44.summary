@entity7 received it in 1944 while he was in the @entity10 camp in southern @entity11 , having been locked up for taking part in the @entity13			1
within minutes hundreds of prisoners in the camp , which included inmates from across @entity17 and @entity18 , had gathered around his window , to sing @entity20 and other carols in different languages in the snow			2
@entity24 of hope : the tree was smuggled into the @entity28 camp in a food parcel and brought @entity31 cheer to prisoners of war at @entity10 mr @entity7 , then 19 , had been incarcerated by @entity35 ’s regime three months earlier while fighting against the @entity11 in the @entity13			1
the tree was the last gift he received from his parents , who he would not see for another 15 years			2
mr @entity7 , now 87 and living in @entity40 , near @entity41 , @entity42 , took the tree with him when he and 75,000 other prisoners at the camp , close to @entity46 , southern @entity11 , were liberated four months later			1
he has treasured it for the past 68 years , lighting it every @entity31 as a reminder of the hope it brought him during his internment			1
‘ we had been forbidden @entity31 trees , even though we were surrounded by them in a beautiful pine forest , but when i received this little collapsible tree from my parents in @entity60 , i decided i just had to share it , ’ mr @entity7 , a retired architect , said			1
‘ my heart was so full , because here was a link with home , where every year we had a tree			0
‘ it was a frosty night , and within minutes hundreds of prisoners who saw the candles in the window had gathered outside in the snow			0
they came from all over the world , and started singing @entity20 and other carols in all their different languages , some wiping tears from their eyes			0
‘ we had practically nothing to eat - just watery soup the @entity11 gave us - but we had survived - and to us it felt like @entity31			1
’ memories : mr @entity7 , pictured in his home in @entity42 and aged 17 , lights the @entity31 tree every year after the camp was liberated by @entity85 forces in april 1945 , mr @entity7 , who had badly injured his right arm during the uprising , was sent to @entity89 and later @entity90 for treatment			1
he arrived in the @entity92 on a stretcher with a bag containing just a toothbrush , a scrap of soap and his tiny , treasured tree			0
he spent three years in an orthopaedic hospital in @entity100 , where he studied for an architecture degree , and later moved to @entity40 to work on the expansion of @entity103			0
‘ the tree was the last thing i had from my parents , whom i would not see again for 15 years , ’ said mr @entity7 , who was later decorated by the @entity92 for his war heroics			1
‘ i joined the @entity60 resistance at 14 , helped blow up bridges and planes and fought for five years before i was wounded and captured in the @entity13			2
‘ thankfully , my parents survived and so did my sister , who was in another prison camp , though it would be years before we would all find each other and manage to be reunited			0
‘ i studied for my architect ’s degree during the three years i was an inmate at the orthopaedic hospital in @entity100 where my arm was saved			0
i was very fortunate in having the services of @entity121 , personal surgeon to @entity122			0
’ mr @entity7 met and married a @entity92 woman , with whom he had two daughters , before divorcing			2
he met his second wife , @entity125 , 81 , a pole who also fled her home country after the war , in the early 1960s			0
the couple have a daughter and three grandchildren and will celebrate their golden wedding anniversary next year			0
the tree is so important to them that this year they decided to include it on their @entity31 card to family and friends			1
‘ every year , when we light the tree we feel so close together , so lucky that we have each other , that @entity7 survived all those horrible years , and it makes @entity31 come alive for us , ’ mrs @entity140 said			1
‘ the tree has seen better times , having survived a fire and other mishaps , but every year it makes us both feel grateful we have had such a beautiful life together			0
