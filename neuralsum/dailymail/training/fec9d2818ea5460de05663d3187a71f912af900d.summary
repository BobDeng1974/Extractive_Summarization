by @entity0 published : 12:07 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 10:35 est , 20 september 2013 it 's been hailed as the safest smartphone on the market with its fingerprint recognition technology			1
and now the @entity5 has proved just how secure its new password service is , by registering a cat 's paw print as a key to unlock the gadget			1
technology site , @entity12 , wanted to test the new @entity14 feature which allows the phone 's owner and four other @entity14 profiles to unlock the phone using skin - recognition technology			1
video : the @entity5 cat paw test ( @entity12 ) touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
users can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			0
@entity14 can also be replace an @entity34 password when buying music , apps or books			2
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - resolution image scan before the @entity42 in @entity44 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip			0
the prints are not stored on an @entity52 server , or backed up to @entity53			0
after a few false starts , the cat 's paw was recognised as one of the owner 's five chosen keys and was able to access the phone 's content			1
the user was also able to use the heel of his palm and his wrist in the experiment which is described as ' a broadening of the definition of what counts as a “ fingerprint ” '			2
though different parts of the body were able to be registered and then recognised as keys , when trying to fool the phone 's software by using the opposite hand than registered access was denied			1
the experiment pointed out however that no other animals could be used to unlock the phone as cats have unique fingerprint like paws			2
another technology site , @entity85 , found @entity14 is not just a fingerprint sensor , but a toe and fingerprint sensor			1
their tests found that a print from a toe was able to unlock the phone perfectly every time			2
@entity12 wanted to test a theory that even animals could use @entity52 's new @entity14 feature			1
amazingly , after a few false starts , the cat 's paw worked and was able to unlock the phone repeatedly @entity52 unveiled the fingerprint scanner on its @entity5 last week with bold claims about its high levels of encryption and security			1
the firm even suggested that its @entity14 system could revolutionise smartphone security and replace the traditional , everyday password			2
the @entity14 sensor is built into the premium phone 's ' home ' button and can be used to unlock the phone , as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or pin			1
speaking at the launch event in @entity122 , @entity52 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing @entity123 said : ' half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords			0
[ @entity14 ] is an easier and more fun alternative			0
technology site pocket - @entity128 found that @entity14 is not just a fingerprint sensor , but a toe and fingerprint sensor ' it uses key you have with you everywhere you go			1
' it works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			0
a user can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			0
@entity14 can also replace an @entity34 password when buying music , apps or books			0
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity42 in @entity44 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
@entity52 said it is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now			0
' it is also designed to become more accurate the more it is used			0
@entity123 reassured users that @entity14 is secure by explaining that ' all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip ' adding the prints are not stored on an @entity52 server , or backed up to @entity53 .			2

technology site wanted to test if any skin - not just *human* fingerprints - could unlock an @entity5
the cat 's paw was registered as one of five safe @entity14 profiles
heel of palm and wrist were also able to unlock the phone 's content
