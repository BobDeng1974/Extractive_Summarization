the world 's first algae - powered building is being piloted in @entity3			1
the building , which was designed by multinational firm @entity5 , features panel glass bioreactors on the facade which contain microalgae			1
these algae generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source			1
the building , which was designed by @entity5 , features panel glass bioreactors on the facade which contain microalgae the building features panel glass bioreactors on the facade			1
each of the 129 bioreactors measures 2.5m by 0.7m			2
they contain algae that generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source			1
they also insulate the building and keep out noise			1
the panels are controlled by an energy management centre in which solar thermal heat and algae are harvested and stored to be used to create hot water			1
at the same time , the systems provides insulation for the building and keeps out noise			1
currently , 129 bioreactors - each measuring 2.5m by 0.7m - have been fitted to the southwest and southeast faces of the building			2
they are controlled by an energy management centre in which solar thermal heat and algae are harvested and stored to be used to create hot water			2
@entity44 , @entity5 ’s @entity45 , said : ' using bio-chemical processes in the facade of a building to create shade and energy is a really innovative concept			1
' it might well become a sustainable solution for energy production in urban areas , so it is great to see it being tested in a real - life scenario			0
' the news comes after @entity5 announced their vision for the future of skyscrapers which suggested that buildings would be ' living ' buildings powered by algae that respond automatically to the weather and the changing needs of inhabitants			1
research by engineering multinational @entity5 , the firm behind the @entity69 , the @entity70 and many of the stadia for the @entity73 , imagined how urban buildings could look by 2050			1
these algae generate biomass and heat as a renewable energy source their predictions included ideas as outlandish as jet - powered maintenance robots , high - rise farms and photovoltaic paint - all of which , incredibly , are already in development			1
' in 2050 , the urban dweller and the city are in a state of constant flux - changing and evolving in reaction to emerging contexts and conditions , ' the report said			0
' the urban building of the future fosters this innate quality , essentially functioning as a living organism in its own right - reacting to the local environment and engaging with the users within			2
' skyscraper of the future : a new report claims that by 2050 buildings will have modular designs maintained by jet - powered drones , a digital ' nervous system ' and be entirely fuel efficient thanks to algae fuel cells the study by @entity5 ’s internal think tank predicted that structures would be fully integrated into the fabric of the city , responsive to changes in the external environment , and designed for continuous adaptability			1
responding to estimates that in four decades 75 per cent of an estimated global population of nine billion will be living in cities , it foresaw a shift to increasingly dense urban environments			0
at the same time , it predicted , the rise of networked ' smart ' devices could lead cities ' where everything can be manipulated in realtime and where all the components of the urban fabric are part of a single smart system and an internet of things '			2
the @entity134 company that built the @entity135 has landed a contract to build what will become the world 's tallest building - and plans reveal the two look remarkably similar			0
@entity143 - based @entity142 won the £ 780million deal to build the @entity145 , pictured right in an artist 's impression , in @entity148 , @entity149 , which will stand more than 3,280ft ( 1km ) high			0
the @entity135 is currently western @entity151 's tallest building at 1,003ft ( 306m ) high			0
@entity142 will participate in a joint venture with fellow @entity134 firm @entity153 to create the huge building , which has been given a completion date of 2018			2
the @entity145 , which will have a construction area of more than 5,381,955 square feet , will stand at four times the size of the @entity135			0
it will overlook the @entity159 and is expected to take over from the @entity160 in @entity161 , which stands at 2,717ft ( 828m ) , as the world 's tallest skyscraper			0
it is not yet known how tall the skyscraper will be as developers keep exact details of the plan a secret			0
the most incredible prediction in the @entity5 report was that the buildings of the future would benefit from brain - like ' intelligent building systems ' that enable them to automatically adjust to the needs of inhabitants			1
using data about energy consumption , weather , and the whims of residents , they would be able to make ' calculated decisions ' about how to best use resources			0
this could extend as far as using jet - powered maintenance arms to swap the ' modules ' that form the building blocks of the skyscraper			0
such modular components could be used for residential or commercial units , or even urban food production sites housing animal , fish or vegetable farms , depending on what is needed at the time			0
' in this emerging age , with significant developments in construction , prefabricated and modular systems are moved and assembled by robots that work seamlessly together to install , detect , repair and upgrade components of the building system , ' the report said			2
with human population set to mushroom , the predictions took into account likely increased concern about the pressure so many souls would put on our planet 's already - strained natural resources			0
the @entity5 report promised buildings that would one day in fact produce more resources than they consume thanks to external walls coated with photovoltaic paint , wind turbines and even pods growing bio-fuel producing algae			1
@entity230 spaces would be dispersed throughout the building to encourage urban biodiversity , while water systems would be optimised for recycling and reuse and filters would cut down on environmental pollutants , it said			0
the building 's facades , as well as having the potential to generate power from the sun , could also be coated with nano - particle treatments that neutralise airborne pollutants and capture waste carbon dioxide			2
elements such as vast organic leds could even allow for whole surfaces of the structure to light up at night , creating a new form of street lighting			0
' coupled with daylight absorbing abilities , the technology realises the possibility of ' net zero energy ' artificial lighting , ' the report said			0
the @entity5 report , entitled it 's alive , was put together by @entity260 , a consultant in the company 's @entity261 , an internal think tank which focuses on the future of the built environment			2
he concluded : ' by producing food and energy , and providing clean air and water , buildings evolve from being passive shells into adaptive and responsive organisms - living and breathing structures supporting the cities of tomorrow			0
' research by engineering multinational @entity5 , the firm behind the @entity69 , the @entity70 and many of the stadia for the @entity73 , imagined how urban buildings could look by 2050			1

@entity280 firm @entity5 has created a building with a facade of bioreactors
the bioreactors contain algae with generate biomass and heat sustainably
system also provides heat and noise insulation for the building
