the @entity1 administration says its healthcare.gov website is much improved and far less crash - prone , but cybersecurity experts warn that using it is an invitation to hackers and identity thieves			2
@entity9 , a former @entity10 analyst whose company @entity11 is hired by big companies to test the security of their computer systems , told @entity15 that the @entity17 website is a worst - case online scenario			1
' it 's really hard to go back and fix the security around it because security was n't built into it , ' @entity9 said			2
' we 're talking multiple months to over a year to at least address some of the critical - to - high exposures on the website itself			0
' @entity26 , ceo of @entity27 , went further , saying that the entire @entity17 enrollment website should be scrapped and rebuilt from scratch with a proper security backbone in place			1
' there 's not a plan to fix this that meets the sniff test of being reasonable , ' said @entity26			0
' @entity54 should be scared to death , ' warned @entity57 rep. @entity56			0
@entity59 rep. @entity58 , another @entity60 , said providing the federal government 's untested website with @entity64 numbers , income levels , mortgage information , dates of birth and home addresses would create ' a mother lode for identity theft			1
' ' there 's not a plan to fix this that meets the sniff test of being reasonable , ' said cybersecurity ceo @entity26 ' it 's not only @entity64 numbers , ' @entity9 agreed			1
' it ’s one of the largest collections of personal data , social security and everything else , that we ’ve ever seen			0
' @entity58 asked the panel whether they think the public can use the @entity17 website safely			1
' given healthcare.gov ’s security issues , and assuming for the moment that you would be personally responsible for all damages incurred from your advice , ' he asked , ' would any of you advise an @entity54 citizen to use this website as the security issues now exist ? ' ' no , ' replied all four , including @entity9 and @entity26			2
three of the witnesses agreed that the site should be shut down and rebuilt			0
@entity9 told @entity15 that that 15 state - level health insurance exchange websites , including one run by the @entity101 , are equally vulnerable and will be ' a large area for attack			0
' he pointed to a problem on the @entity106 website on friday			0
on nov. 22 , officials in charge of the @entity110 website admitted that one user was shown the personal information of another – including a social security number			1
in another case , a government website delivered a @entity119 man 's personal information to an unrelated person in @entity121			0
president @entity1 returned to campaign mode on tuesday , trying to re-sell the @entity17 to the @entity54 people amid concerns that its flagship website is unworkable and lacks security features a nov. 19 @entity49 hearing found that none of the four witnesses would recommend healthcare.gov as a safe website for consumers to use			1

ceos from computer security firms say it would take a year or more to plug healthcare.gov 's security holes – if it can be done at all
@entity64 numbers , dates of birth , home addresses and mortgage information make the @entity17 website 's *database* a hacker 's dream
every witness in a *november* *congressional* hearing said consumers should n't be encouraged to use the website
