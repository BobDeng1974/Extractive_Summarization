public health bosses in the @entity15 noted that life expectancy aged 85 was ' going backwards '			1
in one local authority , it had dropped from living a further 6.8 years aged 85 in 2011 to just 6.5 years ( file photo ) and the trend was particularly pronounced for elderly women where , in one local authority , it had dropped from living a further 6.8 years aged 85 in 2011 to just 6.5 years			0
@entity24 – the government agency responsible for preventing early death – confirmed the fall in women ’s life expectancy had occurred across the country and it was carrying out further analysis to establish the reasons			1
but senior doctors and mps are worried it is the beginning of a long - term trend brought about by cuts to the @entity37 and social care			1
the email which triggered the investigation – leaked to @entity41 - was sent by @entity42 , director of public health in @entity44 with @entity46 council , to @entity24 at the end of last month			1
it reads : ‘ i just wanted to alert you to the fact that it may now be likely that in many @entity54 ( local authority ) areas in the @entity55 ) / @entity24 are no longer living longer			1
’ ‘ this effect is statistically significant , sustained and ( probably ) preventable ! ’ it goes on to warn that such a ‘ sustained ’ reduction in life expectancy is ‘ extremely unusual ’ and should send out a public health ‘ alarm ’			2
the email lists possible causes such as cuts to basic fall - prevention services and meals and wheels as well as worsening gp and hospital care			2
senior doctors and mps are worried it is the beginning of a long - term trend brought about by cuts to the @entity37 and social care ( file photo ) senior doctors are unsure as to why the fall has occurred in women and not men but believe it could be the start of a long - term trend affecting both sexes			1
dr @entity80 , vice president of the @entity81 , which represents 3,000 doctors and other specialists said : ‘ i am concerned about these figures			0
‘ the obvious concern is about shortcomings in social care which is related to the current debate on accident and emergency @entity91 mp , @entity93 ’s shadow minister for care and @entity94 , said : ‘ this government ’s cuts to adult social care are having a devastating impact			0
half a million fewer people are now getting vital care services , which means more are ending up in hospital or getting stuck in hospital when they do n’t need to be there			0
professor @entity103 , chief knowledge officer at @entity24 acknowledged that although there had been a fall in life expectancy in women in 2012 , early analysis suggested it had n’t continued into 2013			1
figures from the @entity110 for @entity24 show that life expectancy aged 85 for women has dropped from 6.85 years in 2009 - 11 to 6.83 years in 2011 - 13			2
for men it has continued to rise – although at a slower pace than previously - from 5.81 years to 5.83 years over the same period ( file photo ) referring to possible causes , he added : ‘ [ it is ] influenced by many factors and has fluctuated from year to year in the past			0
‘ however , @entity24 is currently conducting further analysis of these trends and we hope to make the findings available in the near future			0
’ figures from the @entity110 for @entity24 show that life expectancy aged 85 for women has dropped from 6.85 years in 2009 - 11 to 6.83 years in 2011 - 13			2
