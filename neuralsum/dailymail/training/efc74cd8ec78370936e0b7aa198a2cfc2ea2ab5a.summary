by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 00:28 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 24 june 2013 @entity2 has been sacked as coach of @entity4 just 16 days before the start of the @entity6 , with @entity7 appointed as his replacement			1
the @entity9 has been the target of criticism in @entity4 both for the form of the team and the disciplinary issues which have dogged them in @entity16 and @entity17			1
captain @entity18 has also resigned as a selector in the wake of @entity2 's dismissal , believed to be as a show of support for the departed coach			1
dumped : @entity2 ( left ) has been axed by @entity4 just before the @entity6 begins some believe that @entity18 's role as a selector - and the strain it puts on his relationships with the squad - has contributed to @entity4 's bad form			1
@entity34 ceo @entity33 said , of @entity2 's sacking : ' the timing is far from ideal but we did n’t feel we could sit back and hope matters would change without addressing issues critical to a high performing team culture			1
' it obviously is n’t the type of change we want to make three weeks out from the @entity6 commencing but we believe a change is needed			0
' he continued : ' this has been a difficult decision to make but one that we feel is necessary			0
we are looking to establish a high performing @entity49 cricket team that is consistent over a period of time			0
' to achieve that , we need all the parts moving in the right direction			0
recent on - field results have been too inconsistent			0
incoming : @entity55 coach and former @entity49 cricketer @entity7 is set to replace @entity2 ' discipline , consistency of behaviour and accountability for performance are all key ingredients that need to improve			1
and we see that the head coach is ultimately responsible for that			2
' @entity66 decided yesterday that @entity2 should not continue as head coach of the @entity49 cricket team			1
in taking this decision , the @entity66 accepted the recommendation to make an immediate change as being in the best interests of the team			0
' @entity2 said : ' naturally i ’m very disappointed with how this has all ended			2
i certainly wanted to see the job through but i accept that the team has n’t been completely galvanised under my leadership and our performances have been inconsistent			0
@entity82 , his wife told @entity4 's @entity84 news : ' he 's absolutely shattered			1
' he 's an absolutely shattered man			2
he never saw it coming for one minute			0
' he was so looking forward to the @entity6 and working with the test team again			0
he 's just absolutely devastated			2
' ' i ’m certainly a believer in good culture and traditions much like all @entity49 and feel we were starting to get a shift in the right direction			0
we certainly need the team to be absolutely unified if we ’re any chance of beating the @entity95			0
' @entity33 continued : ' @entity7 has been appointed as the new @entity4 head coach			1
he has had outstanding success in a short time with @entity99 winning the @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 all within the last two years			0
@entity7 will be contracted until june 2015 – post the @entity103			2
the @entity66 considered him the outstanding candidate to drive the cultural change required in the team and to take it to the number one ranking in all formats of the game			0
' no - one is underestimating the task at hand but we believe he is the right man for the job			0
it is up to the players to respond under his leadership and demonstrate their commitment to a successful @entity49 team			0
' @entity33 also claimed that @entity18 's decision to step down as a selector had been coming since the tour of @entity16			1
he explained : ' being a team selector was proving to be a significant drain on @entity18 ’s time and he sees this as distracting from his primary responsibilities as a player and as captain			1
' the board unanimously supported @entity18 's request and believes that given the coaching change now is also the best time to enact this selection change as well			1
' @entity18 will continue to be consulted ' heavily ' by the @entity135 on all team selection issues			1
role relinquished : captain @entity18 ( right ) has stepped down as a selector gone : @entity2 has been dismissed @entity2 was appointed as successor to @entity140 in 2011 and was @entity4 's first overseas coach			1
his time in charge has been far from easy as @entity4 have struggled to replace retiring stars like @entity145 and @entity146			2
perhaps the nadir of @entity2 's tenure came this march on the tour of @entity16 when vice-captain @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 were disciplined for failing to make a presentation on how the team could improve , an incident which became known as ' homework-gate '			2
disciplinary issues continued to haunt the team in @entity17 earlier this month when opener @entity160 was suspended because of an attack on @entity17 batsman @entity163 in a bar			1
to compound matters , @entity4 finished bottom of their group in the @entity169 after suffering two defeats , including against @entity6 opponents @entity17			2
with the first test of back - to - back @entity6 series beginning on july 10 , the timing is undoubtedly a surprise			0
but former @entity4 bowler @entity176 felt @entity2 's position had grown tenuous since the tour of @entity16			1
he told @entity178 : ' i 'm shocked at the timing [ but ] i would have thought he was on thin ice with the performances of the team on the field in the last six months , particularly that disastrous @entity186 tour where we lost 4 - 0 , but also what 's been happening off the field			2
' it just shows for me that they 're not united and for the leadership within the @entity49 team , that 's the biggest job , to make sure everyone 's going in the right direction and that has n't appeared to be happening in the last six months			0
' should @entity7 be named as @entity2 's replacement , he will take over at a key moment in @entity49 cricket , as they attempt to regain the @entity6 having lost the last two @entity204 series against @entity17			1
@entity7 has impressed since being appointed coach of @entity55			1
disorder and disarray : @entity4 have been performing badly and @entity2 paid the price @entity176 said : ' @entity7 was a fine @entity49 player , they love him up in @entity210 , he 's a legend there and he 's done some good work for @entity55			1
he took over a couple of years ago , they 've won the @entity100 , the @entity214			0
' he 's got the blend of being a fine @entity49 cricketer in his own right and you do n't want to get on the wrong side of @entity220 ( @entity7 )			2
' the only question for him is when you are coaching a new team you want to bring in your own structures			0
is he going to be able to so that 20 days out from the @entity6 ? i do n't think so			0
' but i 'd like an @entity49 coach and particularly one who 's been a fine player like @entity7			1
' @entity7 himself is no stranger to disciplinary breaches			2
in 2003 he received a five - match ban from the @entity232 for a racial outburst after a game against @entity235 .			0
