by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:57 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 29 may 2013 rules forcing descendants of @entity4 to ask the monarch for permission to tie the knot are to be torn up			1
@entity8 and @entity9 are among those related to the former king whose weddings are technically ‘ void ’ if they failed to ask @entity13 if they could tie the knot			1
deputy pm @entity16 said the 240 - year - old law was ‘ unworkable ’ as he set out plans to shake - up rules governing succession to the throne			1
but he was accused of opening a ' royal @entity22 '			2
relative values : @entity25 mayor @entity9 and pm @entity8 are both descendants of @entity4 who needed to ask the monarch for permission to tie the knot legislation will end discrimination against future female royals so that men will no longer take precedence over women in the order of succession			1
it will also end the bar on heirs marrying @entity40 if they want to keep their entitlement to the throne			0
under the 1772 @entity44 any descendent of @entity4 must seek the reigning monarch ’s consent before marrying – without which their marriage is void , mr @entity16 told the @entity49			1
‘ this law – passed 240 years ago – is clearly now unworkable : @entity4 ’s descendants number in their hundreds ; many will be unaware of this arcane requirement ; many will have only a tenuous link to the royal family			1
’ among those descendants are the prime minister and the @entity25 mayor			0
under the @entity63 , descendants of @entity4 could not marry without the agreement of the crown @entity4 was mr @entity8 ’s great - great - great - great - great - great - great - great grandfather			1
however it is thought that because the pm is a descendent of an illegitimate daughter of @entity71 , who was @entity4 's grandson , his claim to the throne is invalid and he may not have needed to seek permission to marry			1
mr @entity9 is a descendant of @entity73 , @entity74 the illegitimate daughter of prince @entity76 whose great - great grandfather was @entity4 the @entity78 warns that ‘ every marriage of any such descendant , without such consent , shall be null and void ’			1
mr @entity16 told @entity82 that new legislation ‘ proposes that the monarch need only consent to the marriages of the first six individuals in the line of succession – without which they would lose their place ’			2
he added : ‘ that way we retain the tradition of monarchical consent , but , in limiting it to the people who could – feasibly – assume the throne it will be applied in a much more reasonable way			0
’ the rules of succession are being changed so the baby of the @entity103 and @entity104 will become monarch , even if it is a girl who later has younger brothers the measure is buried in the @entity110 which will clear the way for the baby of the @entity103 and @entity104 to take the throne , whether it ’s a boy or a girl			1
@entity115 countries have cleared the way for the rule change , which will mean the royal couple ’s first child , expected in july , can become monarch even if it is a girl who later has younger brothers			1
@entity123 mp @entity122 complained that the changes were being rushed through with the urgency of terror legislation mr @entity16 said : ‘ the current rules of succession belong to a bygone era			0
they reflect old prejudices and old fears			0
‘ today we do n't support laws which discriminate on either religious or gender grounds , they have no place in modern @entity137 and certainly not in our monarchy , an institution central to our constitution , to the @entity115 and to our national identity too			0
’ the current rules were based on ‘ supposed superiority of men ’ , mr @entity16 said			0
however he was bombarded by questions in the @entity49 on technicalities and unintended consequences of the @entity148 , including how titles like the @entity103 – held by @entity150 – will be passed on in future			2
mr @entity16 was accused of opening a ' royal @entity22 '			0
critics of the @entity148 also complained that major constitutional changes were being rushed through the @entity49 with just two days for debate			2
@entity123 mp @entity122 said the @entity156 was being ‘ treated as if it was terrorism legislation ’ and it was an ‘ insult to the nation and to our sovereign and indeed to @entity162 ’			0
the @entity163 has also reportedly raised concerns about the legislation with a senior government official			0
in a meeting with @entity169 , permanent secretary of the @entity170 , the @entity163 voiced worries about what will happen if his grandchild marries a @entity174 , the @entity167 reported earlier this month			0
it is assumed any children born to a future royal and their catholic partner would be brought up as @entity40			0
but this could ultimately lead to the constitutional crisis of a future king or queen being barred from the throne because they are a @entity174 - something which is still outlawed .			2

240 - year - old law to be *scrapped* which means weddings of relatives of @entity4 were ' void ' if permission was not granted
@entity9 and @entity8 are both related to the former king
change is part of @entity148 which will allow @entity104 and @entity71 's baby to be monarch even if it is a girl
