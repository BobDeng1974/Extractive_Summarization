by @entity0 last updated at 1:49 am on 2nd march 2012 @entity1 died after choking on a sweet in front of his terrified family a boy of ten who choked on a gobstopper died because an ambulance crew could n’t pinpoint his house on their satellite navigation system			1
@entity10 was playing in his garden when the sweet became lodged in his windpipe			2
his parents dialled 999 and , with @entity1 ’s 13 - year - old sister watching on , desperately tried to clear the youngster ’s throat while they waited for help to arrive			1
despite arriving in the road within eight minutes , paramedics could n’t find the family home on the in - built satnav and lost several vital minutes			1
eventually , the ambulance crew found the address but by then @entity1 had turned blue and stopped breathing			1
paramedics spent 20 minutes trying to revive him but , although they managed to restart his heart , he was pronounced dead in hospital several hours later			2
last night it emerged that although the road where @entity1 lived , in @entity32 , @entity33 , was built in 2007 , his house had been completed only three months before last june ’s tragedy			1
this meant it was not on the @entity38 ’s satnav system , which is updated annually each september			0
@entity1 ’s mother , @entity40 , 38 , and father , @entity41 , 52 , a nightclub entertainer , are now taking legal action against @entity38 for failing their son , who was autistic and was unable to speak			2
miss @entity40 , who has three other children with mr @entity41 – @entity46 , 20 , @entity47 , 13 , and one - year - old @entity48 – said yesterday : ‘ we were relying on that ambulance			2
the woman on the phone kept saying “ it should be with you ” , but there was no sign			0
‘ we ’ve had no other problems			0
we get post , takeaways , everything – but not an ambulance to save my little boy ’s life			1
’ anger : @entity40 and @entity41 by their street sign			2
the @entity67 could n't find their home on their computer , despite the address being in the a-z sources at @entity38 said a fast - response paramedic and ambulance crew were dispatched at 6.39pm on june 26 last year and arrived at @entity77 , where the family lived , at 6.47pm and 6.48pm respectively			1
despite there being just 44 houses in the street , paramedics could not find the home , which is at the far end of a @entity85 , until 6.52pm			1
the delay meant the ambulance missed the target response time of eight minutes by five minutes			2
miss @entity40 said : ‘ so many new estates are being built all the time – is the ambulance service saying this risk is there for all those houses across the country ? ’ she said children playing in the street later reported the ambulance crew parked on a nearby road for several minutes beforehand			1
clearly marked : @entity40 points to her street in the 2010 @entity33 a-z ‘ they could have asked the children where our street was , but instead they just sat there and let @entity1 die , ’ miss @entity40 said			1
