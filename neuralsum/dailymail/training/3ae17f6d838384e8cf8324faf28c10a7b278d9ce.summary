miss @entity24 said : ‘ they ( the police ) have investigated one side of the story and they have not investigated the other			0
‘ if this is nothing to do with money why is there even mention of an out - of - court payment ? ’ trial judge @entity44 then told the jury during his summing up of the case : ‘ you may think it extraordinary that no claim of blackmail has ever been followed ( up ) by @entity51 ’			1
mr @entity5 had denied raping the woman – claiming they had consensual sex when she ‘ came on ’ to him with a ‘ passionate ’ kiss in an empty part of the village pub , yards from where mrs @entity60 was drinking			1
the december 2006 encounter in @entity63 , @entity16 , only came to light seven years later when the woman told a male friend about the alleged sex attack			1

@entity77 heard mr @entity5 took his wife along with him to confront the woman after receiving the first letter , before she made a formal complaint to police in december 2013			2
during the trial a police officer in the case was questioned by @entity86 about the content of the letters received by mr @entity5			2
detective chief inspector @entity89 said the decision was made to treat the letter - writer as a witness and not a suspect because officers considered no threats had been made towards mr @entity5			2
prosecutor @entity96 told the jury it was the @entity99 ’s case that the alleged victim knew nothing about her friend ’s decision to attempt to ‘ achieve some sort of informal justice ’ for her by writing to mr @entity5			1
but the trial heard the letters were not finger - printed by police because they were ‘ not the focus ’ of the police investigation			0
miss @entity24 told the jury : ‘ the victim , on her account , says she has not touched them			0
were her fingerprints on those letters ? we will never know because the police never bothered			0

but he told the jury the allegation of rape had ‘ wrecked ’ his life			0
he denied suggestions from mr @entity96 that he had forced himself upon the woman because he thought that he and his wife were going to ‘ engage in some swinging ’ – the swapping of sexual partners			2
mr @entity5 branded the suggestion ‘ absolutely ludicrous ’			0

‘ the letters ( sent to mr @entity5 ) were not judged to have passed the threshold for a prosecution for blackmail			0
’ a @entity145 spokesperson said : ‘ it was determined that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of a conviction and that it was in the public interest to proceed			0
‘ it is the role of the jury to listen to the evidence from the prosecution and from the defence and decide on that evidence alone whether a defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt - this is a different test than the one applied in our decision making			2
' in this instance , having heard arguments from the prosecution and the defence , the jury have determined that mr @entity5 is not guilty of rape and we respect that decision			1
’ @entity5 , formerly of @entity63 but now living in @entity7 , @entity177 , has been suspended from work since his arrest last march			0
