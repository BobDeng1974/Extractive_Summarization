by 10 , @entity5 's lessons teaching his daughter ' how to be a woman ' turned violent and his regular raping produced five children out of incest in a perverse attempt to create a ' pure ' bloodline			1
@entity5 , who is also known as @entity13 and won fame after directing the @entity17 ' ' @entity16 ' video , was sentenced to 50 years in prison on july 26 , finally ending @entity0 's nightmare			1
the incredibly brave woman , who is now 35 , married and running a promising baking business , spoke out about the traumatic childhood this week for the first time			1
nightmare : the @entity26 case appears to mirror the story of @entity28 woman @entity0 , pictured , whose father raped her from the age of eight , getting her pregnant five times @entity0 told @entity32 her childhood started off relatively normal			1
she lived with her mother and father on the third - floor of an apartment in @entity38 , @entity28 , with her @entity40 immigrant grandparents living below			1
locked up : her father , @entity5 , now faces a combined 90 years in prison for the sexual abuses he committed against two of his daughters @entity0 was home - schooled but still allowed to play with the neighborhood children			1
when her family grew to include eight children they moved into a bigger apartment in the same building			2
it was when @entity0 started to mature that her father started giving her unwanted attention			1
' he told me i was special			0
initially , it was to teach me to be a woman , ' she said			0
' by the time he started having intercourse with me , he was getting more and more violent			2
when i would start fighting him , he would hit me			0
it was more about threats			0
' her father began to change , and became more controlling over the family			2
he moved them out of their grandparent 's apartment to another house in @entity38 before relocating to @entity70 in @entity71			0
the children were only allowed to watch a small amount of tv , and nothing that depicted traditional family life			2
modern medicine was outlawed in the house , and he actually told his wife that his relations with @entity0 were to treat her eczema			2
@entity0 was n't the only one @entity5 was having sex with			1
he had a mistress - a @entity85 lawyer whom he had another two children with - and was also abusing one of @entity0 's sisters			1
he called himself a polygamist and a prophet			0
his family was allowed to pray to god but could only do so through him			0
' he said the world was going to end , and it was just going to be him and his offspring and that he was chosen , ' his ex-wife , @entity93 testified at a 2010 pre-trial hearing			0

when @entity0 's first child was born without defects , @entity5 took it as proof and continued to rape the girl to get her pregnant			1
damaging : @entity0 gave birth to five children by her father , and many of them inherited a rare genetic disorder due to inbreeding award winner : @entity5 , who is also known as @entity13 , won fame after directing the video for ' @entity16 ' by @entity17 , pictured but the following children would not be so lucky			1
two further daughters born from her father would be diagnosed with phenylketonuria ( @entity117 ) a condition that prevents the body from breaking down amino acids			2
@entity117 can cause brain damage and seizures			0
dr. @entity123 , a @entity117 specialist who has treated @entity0 's children , said they definitely got the condition because of inbreeding			1
@entity117 is a recessive gene , so both parents must have the gene in order for it to pass along to the child			0
the gene only appears at a rate of 1 in 4,000 world wide and is must lower for african - americans			2
@entity136 's paternal grandfather had the gene			0
better now : since escaping her father , @entity0 has gotten her ged , married and started her own baking business over the years , @entity0 became obsessed with escaping			1
she would sleep just because her dreams were better than real life			0
' i 'd dream about running away			0
i 'd dream about getting all my brothers and sisters — one of my sisters was a baby , and i was taking care of her — i 'd dream about growing breasts and getting milk and running away with them somewhere , ' she said			0
when she was older and one of her sons fell sick , she finally got the courage to take him to the hospital since @entity5 was out of town on a business trip			1
but she did n't know how to interact with the doctors and a social worker stepped in , alerting the @entity159			0
when @entity5 returned from his business trip he was enraged , and threatened to forcibly remove his son from the hospital			1
child services stepped in before he could do that and placed them in separate homes			0
after that @entity0 , her mother and her sisters moved away from @entity5 as she attempted to get her children back			1
her performance in state - mandated courses and counseling impressed the government officials and eventually her children were returned to her			1
' she has been an exceptional mother , ' @entity123 said			0
' she was so attentive and patient , it 's remarkable			0
for a young girl - with all she 's had - she has been just wonderful			2
' having to fight to get her children back also empowered @entity0 , and translated to her life after abuse			2
she now lives in @entity179 , @entity28 with her husband			1
defects : when @entity0 's first child was born without defects , @entity5 took it as a sign that he was creating a ' pure ' bloodline she went back to school for her ged and will finish her liberal arts degree from @entity190 this fall			1
she also runs her own baking business and plans to start a restaurant someday			1
@entity0 and her sister decided to finally bring charges against their abusive father			2
they delayed pressing charges since they were unsure the affect it would have on the children			0
