@entity0 has gained a wealth of experience during almost 40 years as a manager and will have sat through thousands of interviews			1
the 67 - year - old boss , however , will never have been asked to have a conversation with an @entity7 on wheels while answering recorded questions from fans via an interactive ' @entity11 '			1
@entity0 reveals the toughest manager he ’s ever faced in nearly 40 years in the dugout , which former @entity15 players he ’d love to be able to call up to his current squad and who he 'd choose between @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity0 will lead @entity15 out at @entity21 ahead of the @entity23 qualifier against @entity24 on friday @entity25 reveals all in @entity26 what ’s the best way for a young captain to get players playing together ? i do n’t think it ’s the captain ’s total responsibility			1
to get all of the team together and playing off the same hymn sheet and playing together as a team , i think that it ’s a question of what goes on in the training sessions , what the coach or manager is asking of the players and encouraging the players to do			1
the captain plays an important role of course , as the game starts the manager or coach will have less chance to influence what ’s happening on the field of play and that ’s where the captain comes to the fore			1
he very much needs to be in tune with what the team is trying to do , how they ’re trying to play and what ’s s been agreed upon and hopefully what ’s agreed upon has been a matter of discussion and work amongst the players and training staff			1
@entity0 believes as an @entity15 captain , @entity70 must be in tune with the rest of the players it ’s also important that the players feel as though they trust their captain , hopefully look up to him but most importantly can go to the captain with their problems or doubts and with fears			1
and if he ca n’t answer himself with the problems they have he can at least point them in the right direction			0
it ’s important for the captain to show he cares about all of the players and takes responsibility and , most importantly , accept that being captain puts more burden on him both before and after games , to lead from the front and if some of the unpleasant jobs sometimes need doing – with us at the level i ’m talking about it can mean spending more time with the press or doing things for the commercial department			1
the captain sometimes has to take more of a share of that work than some of the other players , he is the captain , he is the one that everyone wants to see and talk to			2
he is the one of course who has the most responsibility			0
it ’s a question of responsibility and making sure you ’re a good listener			2
if you could pick one player from previous squads to be in your current squad , who would it be ? from previous squads , well i suppose that depends on how far back you would go			0
when selecting players , of course there ’s a question of what you need most at any one time			2
one ’s tempted to look to centre forwards of course and @entity135 would be an obvious choice for his goal - scoring ability			2
also a guy like @entity139 was a fantastic captain for @entity15 and a tremendous midfield dynamo i would choose between those too			2
the @entity15 boss plumped for @entity143 ( above ) when asked to pick a player from previous squads who ’s the best manager you ’ve competed against ? usually it ’s teams that concern me the most , and the players within the teams , but i ’ve been lucky enough to have a long career to come across some very good ones			1
all the ones i ’ve come across over the last eight or five years before taking this job , when i was in the @entity156 , outside of that to national managers i would have to say @entity159			0
i would have to say he revolutionised @entity161 football , he was a big fan of @entity163 football			0
he based a lot of his ideas on what he had seen @entity163 teams do in the past			2
i enjoyed my battles with @entity159 when he was managing @entity170 and i was managing @entity171 and was lucky to get to know him and hear about his philosophies			0
@entity0 believes former @entity170 boss @entity159 ( centre ) revolutionised @entity161 football what ’s the strangest thing that ’s ever happened to you during a game ? it was during a qualifying match for @entity180			1
we were playing against @entity182 in the @entity183 in @entity184 when the game was held up for five or six minutes by an eagle owl , which was nested in the stands , decided it was going to fly up and down the pitch and land on the crossbar			0
it was an amazing sight because these birds are really , really big			0
it made the game all that more interesting for the spectators and luckily we won and the eagle owl was adopted as a mascot by the @entity200 national team afterwards			0
@entity0 was answering recorded questions from supporters via a ' @entity11 ' during a q&a at @entity21 the 67 - year - old manager also revealed his admiration for @entity207 tennis star @entity206 outside of football what athletes do you admire most , past or present ? not an easy one to answer – there are so many great athletes that have done such great things outside of my own sport , the sport i understand most			1
i would maybe look to tennis which is the sport i have played most outside of football			0
the two sporting heroes in that regard that have had great achievements are firstly @entity224 , @entity225 champion and latterly @entity206			0
who was your favourite football player when growing up ? i had three i guess going through the different stages of my youth			0
the first was at @entity232 , @entity233 , and then there were two who were fairly contemporary but both shared my affections , one was @entity238 at @entity232 and @entity239 and the second was @entity241 when he came down to the @entity242			0
if you could steal a player from an international team , who would it be ? good question – lots to choose from			0
i would plump for @entity19			2
@entity0 chose @entity249 star @entity19 as the one player he would steal away from their national team			1
