by @entity0 , @entity1 boss @entity2 insists @entity4 's homecoming will be as big as their @entity6 triumph			1
the @entity4 will return to the @entity7 on friday to host @entity8 , after over a year of playing in @entity9			1
the club ended a rent dispute with the stadium 's owners , @entity7 , last month to make the switch possible			1
pleased as punch : @entity4 boss @entity2 ca n't wait for his side to return to the @entity7 and @entity2 believes it is one of the most monumental days in the club 's history since they won the @entity6 in 1987			1
' with the emotions , without doubt			0
it 's maybe the most emotional day since winning @entity6 , ' he said with the club expecting over 25,000 fans			1
' it 's a night when we have responsibility to entice supporters back on a regular basis			2
' it 's a big club starved of success for too long			1
around the ground there are lots of subliminal messages and references to the cup - winning team and a return to the @entity41 is a major step in our history			2
home sweet home : @entity4 have n't played at their @entity7 for over a year due to a rent dispute ' everything surrounding the club at the moment typifies how important the club is to the city			1
we 've had two or three thousand camping out to get tickets			0
it will be a fantastic atmosphere and we can show everyone the potential of this football club			0
' the players spent time at the stadium on thursday afternoon to reacquaint themselves with it and @entity2 admitted they can not let the occasion affect them			1
he said : ' we must focus on our gameplan			0
we 'll arrive on friday night and feel the occasion			1
that 's what big games are			2
it 's a contrast to last year 's arrival at @entity67 where there was n't really an atmosphere			2
' for the players friday is a different occasion to show as a group we can handle it			0
i 've no doubt we can			0
' pure ecstasy : @entity2 says @entity4 's @entity7 return will be on par with their 1987 @entity6 success @entity4 finished 18th last season after being docked 10 points for exiting administration without a @entity84			1
they are 15th in the early @entity86 table and are tipped to challenge for the play - offs now they have returned home			0
but @entity2 refused to talk up his side 's promotion chances			2
little atmosphere : @entity4 have been playing their home games at @entity94 he added : ' i never like to put a position on it , what i say is to fulfil our potential			2
my goal is that we apply ourselves and if we give that i 'll be a happy man			0
' we 've been working in the football department to put the foundations in place			0
but unless we returned to the city all the work we were going to do at the training ground was never going to be enough to put this club in the right direction			0
' we have a foundation now to build this club and take it back to where we want to be			0
