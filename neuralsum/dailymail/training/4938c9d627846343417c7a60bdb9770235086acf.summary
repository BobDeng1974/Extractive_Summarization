prince @entity0 is planning to leave the armed forces this year and devote his time to more charity work , pictured at @entity4 prince @entity0 is to leave the @entity5 within six months to pursue charity work with injured service personnel			1
the captain in the @entity9 and @entity10 is expected to spend much of the next year in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , where he has links with charities			1
senior royal sources said @entity0 , 30 , was at a ‘ crossroads ’ in his military career			1
‘ although the military will always be a huge part of his life , he is at a point when he needs to make significant decisions about his career and the prince believes he can best serve the charities he wants to work with , particularly those helping service personnel , as a civilian , ’ said one			1
it is clear to many who work with @entity0 that since returning from @entity32 he has been struggling to find a suitable long - term military role that can be combined with the causes close to his heart			1
@entity37 declined to comment yesterday on reports of his decision to quit because the fine details are still being worked through			0
the @entity41 understands , however , that he is likely to leave by the end of the summer			2
before then he will spend several weeks with the military in @entity11 as well as representing the @entity44 , along with his father , prince @entity45 , at the 100th anniversary @entity46 commemorations in @entity48			1
last year @entity0 devised and organised the @entity49 , a remarkable @entity51 - style event for wounded servicemen and women which attracted 400 competitors from 13 nations and was lauded as an unqualified success			1
despite that , some senior royal commentators question the wisdom of leaving the forces – which have given the once wayward prince so much direction in his life			1
many believe prince @entity66 ’s decision in 2001 to leave the @entity67 , where he had a distinguished career , caused some of the problems that have dogged him recently			1
when prince @entity0 leaves the @entity72 , the @entity71 will have no senior members on full - time active military service			1
@entity0 has served twice on the front line in @entity32 since graduating from @entity76 in may 2005			1
he was first sent out as a forward air controller in 2007 after his wish to serve in the infantry was deemed too dangerous to both himself and his men			0
the young royal , 30 , served two tours of duty on the front line in @entity32 , pictured making pre-flight checks on an @entity87 helicopter in @entity4 the angry prince was forced to return early from the posting when an @entity91 website broke the news blackout on his deployment			1
he then retrained with the @entity94 and was picked to fly the @entity87 attack helicopter			0
he returned to @entity32 in 2012			1
he left last year to take up a staff officer role in @entity98 to work on his plan to bring the @entity49 to @entity44			2
his move to the capital brought him back to his then girlfriend , @entity103			0
but when the romance ended , he realised he had little appetite to progress up the ranks			0
he is now focused on working for the @entity108 ’s recovery capability programme			0
it involves working alongside case officers in @entity98 ’s @entity111 and visiting recovery centres , forces charities and @entity115 units			2
a source added : ‘ what he is doing now is helping him develop his knowledge of how the system works			0
the military will always play a very important part in prince @entity0 ’s life and especially supporting those who have served or are serving in the @entity5			1
’ he is keen to pursue his interests in ' conservation and wildlife ' and hopes to spend a time on field projects in @entity13 , pictured playing with children during a visit to @entity130 in @entity131 prince @entity0 passed the qualification necessary to train at @entity76 , in september 2004			1
he entered the @entity76 in 2005 and @entity133 announced that he was to join the @entity9 and @entity10 the following year as an officer cadet			0
it was announced that had been serving with the @entity72 in @entity137 , @entity32 for more than two months in 2008			2
he was promoted to the rank of @entity139 with @entity140 ( @entity9 ) and then begin training to become and @entity142 in january 2009			0
prince @entity0 spent three and a half years in training and operational service with the @entity145 during his attachment to the @entity94			1
the royal has undertaken two operational tours of @entity32 , as a forward air controller in 2007 to 2008 and as an @entity150 between september 2012 and january 2013			1
during his time in the @entity94 he was assigned to @entity152 , @entity153 within 16 @entity154 and in july 2013 , prince @entity0 qualified as an @entity155			1
he was promoted to the rank of @entity157 in april 2011 and was also awarded his @entity158 from the officer in @entity160 at the same time			0
the prince , who currently has the rank of @entity157 , took up a staff officer role in @entity98 in 2014			0
pray prince @entity0 does n't make his uncle @entity66 's mistakes , says @entity166 , editor - at - large warrior prince : @entity169 in @entity32 for as long as he can remember , prince @entity0 wanted to be a soldier			1
aged eight , he sat in a @entity172 armoured vehicle in combat fatigues and camouflage paint , beaming as princess @entity175 took the salute at a @entity178 base in @entity179			0
while his brother @entity180 daydreamed about being a policeman – so he could better ‘ protect ’ their mother – @entity0 yearned for active service			2
this ambition drove him from @entity187 ’s combined cadet force , where he narrowly missed out on winning the prized @entity76 , to @entity76 military academy , and finally active service with the @entity9 and @entity10			0
two tours of @entity32 followed , including one as an @entity94 @entity87 pilot after he retrained to fly helicopters			1
so his decision to end a military career just ten years after it began can not have been an easy one			0
it had , after all , seemed he was destined to become one of the few members of the @entity71 to actually earn most of those medals that routinely cover their chests			0
but life in the military represented a paradox for the warrior prince			0
instead of helping him find the freedom he sought away from the heart of the @entity71 , it increasingly began to suffocate him			0
the restrictions imposed on him because of who he was meant the top brass were not prepared to allow him the luxury – as he saw it – of the further front line posting he craved			1
the @entity72 proposed a desk job , a position which @entity0 is neither emotionally nor intellectually equipped to handle			2
he was , i am told , ‘ desperate ’ to stay in uniform but not at any price , and will now seek to find a new life concentrating on charity projects			0
if alarm bells are not ringing at this woolly if honourable prospect , then they should be			0
for there are some uneasy parallels with another significant royal figure who abandoned a military career to seek a new direction – @entity0 ’s uncle @entity66 , who has never found a meaningful role since quitting the @entity67 in 2001			1
once a heartbeat or two away from the throne as @entity45 ’s brother , @entity66 has slipped down the pecking order with the arrival of a new generation of princes			0
now it ’s @entity0 ’s turn to slide down the line of succession			1
@entity243 , and then in april – when the @entity244 is due to give birth – another royal infant will vault ahead of him			0
so at 30 , and unmarried , @entity0 has momentous decisions to make about his future			1
@entity66 was a divorcee and over 40 when he left the @entity67 , only to stagger from one disreputable episode to another in a kind of extended midlife crisis , culminating in the current scandal in which he stands accused of sleeping with an underage girl – which he robustly denies – and consorting with a known paedophile			0
@entity0 's youthful indiscretions – underage drinking , smoking pot and dressing in @entity261 regalia for a party – seem piffling by contrast			2
and as one figure who has been around him all his life tells me : ‘ the difference between @entity0 and @entity66 is vast			2
@entity0 is a nice guy whereas @entity66 is arrogant			2
yes , @entity0 has been a bit misguided at times , but he is intelligent enough to realise he must learn from his mistakes			2
’ when @entity175 was with him that day in @entity179 in 1993 , she saw a confident figure better equipped for royal duty than @entity180 , and privately described him to friends as ‘ good king @entity276 ’			2
what happens next to harness those qualities is crucial			0
hugely popular with the public he may be , but that fondness may leach away if he returns to the sybaritic lifestyle of a party prince			0
@entity0 stands at a crossroads			2
now , we must hope this charismatic young man chooses the correct path .			0
