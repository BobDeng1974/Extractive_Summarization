when @entity0 and @entity1 finally finished renovating their house in @entity4 27 years ago , moving was the last thing on their minds			1
but as they leafed through the pages of a magazine , they saw a photograph of @entity13 in the @entity15 village of @entity16 – and were immediately smitten			1
‘ it was a slightly ridiculous situation , ’ recalls @entity1			1
‘ we had just finished doing up our lovely house and we had a successful clothing business in town			0
' but we fell in love with the tower , and realised that as it was just a 25 - minute journey from nearby @entity25 to @entity26 , it was a simple commute			1
’ @entity0 and @entity1 have put their fairytale ' @entity30 ' tower on the market for £ 1.35million the property certainly makes a memorable first impression			1
five storeys high and covered in ivy , it ’s reminiscent of the tower in the fairy tale @entity30			1
and even without actually setting foot inside the @entity42 home , you can see its appeal			0
built in about 1890 , it was constructed as a water tower , which seems rather prosaic a use for such a magical dwelling			1
it is one of five houses on a private estate			0
although the four others are close by – a couple can be spotted through the trees in the garden – the surroundings are incredibly peaceful			2
the @entity13 was converted in about 1980 , and the @entity59 , who are in their late 50s and have no children , have done a great deal of further work in their time there			1
they converted the @entity13 in 1980 and each room is like a jewel – individual and with dainty touches five storeys high and covered in ivy , it ’s reminiscent of the tower in the fairy tale @entity30 and even boasts a rooftop terrace each room is like a jewel – individual and with dainty touches – with the overwhelming feel of a five - star @entity81 hotel			1
‘ we have travelled a great deal , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ our love of the @entity81 is reflected in the house			1
’ to the left of the high entrance hall is a bright dining room , with double doors leading out to the garden , and a large but elegant ceramic and metal @entity93 log stove in the corner which reaches from floor to ceiling			2
@entity98 : £ 1.35million location : @entity16 , @entity15 bedrooms : four unique features : @entity42 water tower on a private estate , rooftop terrace , @entity93 log stove , good commuter links ‘ it throws out enough heat to warm the whole of the ground floor , ’ says @entity0			1
a flight of stairs takes you to a cosy but light mezzanine sitting room , and at the back of the dining room is a large wine cellar and storage room , which used to be a coal store			2
the kitchen is on the ground floor of the tower and leads to a small study which has windows on three sides , as well as a glass roof			2
‘ it used to be a very pretty breakfast room , ’ says @entity1 , with a slight feeling of resignation			1
‘ but @entity0 wanted it as a study			2
’ although the kitchen is very pretty , the magic of the house is unquestionably in the upper storeys			0
looking up the tower ’s winding staircase , you can see that each of the 100 steps is meticulously carpeted			0
‘ we ’ve just had the carpet put in , ’ @entity1 explains			1
‘ it took months , but it means that the stairs are n’t remotely slippery			0
’ the first - floor bedroom – currently a spare room – has an en suite bathroom and a balcony overlooking the back garden			0
‘ the walls are very thick , so all the rooms stay warm , no matter how chilly it is outside , ’ @entity1 says			2
built in about 1890 , it was constructed as a water tower , which seems rather prosaic a use for such a magical dwelling it is one of five houses on a private estate in @entity15 , but the surroundings are incredibly peaceful the second - floor bedroom is the master bedroom , again with an en suite			1
double - aspect windows overlook the front garden and fields beyond			0
there are two further bedrooms on the subsequent floors , though @entity1 uses the top one as a dressing room , and two round windows hung with exotic fabric give it the feeling of a sitting room			1
‘ it ’s a lovely place to sit and read if you want to get away from everything , ’ she says			0
all the ceilings are surprisingly high , making the rooms feel larger			0
a roof - level door leads to a wooden terrace covering the top of the tower			0
the views are sublime – you can see for miles across the @entity15 countryside , as well as admire the property ’s large front lawn and neighbouring paddock			0
the @entity59 have enjoyed sitting out on the terrace with a glass of wine on many summer evenings			0
there are excellent local schools nearby and @entity200 is just eight miles away , with a decent array of restaurants and shops			0
the couple are now selling up – the property is on the market for £ 1.35 million – and are planning to retire to @entity207			1
‘ we ’ll be sad to leave			0
but we ’re going to go and live by the sea , and perhaps we ’ll buy a vineyard , ’ says @entity1			2
