by @entity0 having lost both her parents to alzheimer ’s disease , @entity1 has witnessed the agonising frustration they endured of being unable to communicate their simplest wishes			1
it is a fate she knows there is a risk she could also suffer if the illness takes hold and the television presenter has revealed that she has now decided to write a letter to her husband and sons , telling them exactly how she wants to be cared for should she be unable to verbalise it			2
yesterday , miss @entity1 , 53 , spoke for the first time about the preparations she is already putting in place should she also develop alzheimer ’s disease			1
@entity21 unveils their ' time to reflect ' garden with sir @entity24 , centre , @entity26 ambassador @entity1 , left , and @entity27 , right it has meant deciding which care home she would like to be looked after in , despite being currently in good health			1
miss @entity1 , who is married to journalist @entity33 and has two sons @entity35 , 15 , and @entity36 , 12 made her comments as she opened an @entity26 garden at the @entity39 yesterday			1
miss @entity1 said : ‘ of course , [ i think about it ] , of course , my husband says “ but you ’ve always been scatty , you ’ve always lost things , you ’ve always forgotten things ”			1
‘ but now i just think “ oh @entity46 , maybe that means it ’s going to become an illness ”			2
i just keep meaning to write a letter to my husband and boys , being in a family of boys , and i only had brothers , i just fear for where are they gon na dump me ? @entity1 , pictured , lost both of her parents to @entity61 's disease ‘ so i keep meaning to write this letter to them saying “ please , put me here , do n’t put me there , and here ’s the money for it ”			1
’ to some it may seem like a rather drastic measure for miss @entity1 to be taking this early in her life , however both her mother , @entity73 , and father , @entity74 , were young when they developed the disease			1
her father was 76 when he died in 2012 and her mother was 74 when she passed away in 2006			0
common signs of @entity61 ’s , which affects one in three people in the @entity81 , include forgetfulness - something miss @entity1 said she has always had - and confusion about time or place			1
and the presenter , who is best known for her @entity86 days and now regularly appears on @entity88 consumer programme watchdog , sadly recalled the experience of her father when he spent the night in a police cell because he could n’t remember his address			0
miss @entity1 said : ‘ we did n’t even know he had dementia and apparently he was driving erratically			1
so the police stopped him , breathalysed him , and he had n’t been drinking			0
but they took him anyway and locked him up for the night			0
i think it ’s because he could n’t tell them where he lived or anything			0
’ it was n’t until days later when he began ‘ babbling about the police ’ that miss @entity1 and her brothers were able to get to the bottom of what had happened			1
even then it proved difficult , with confidentiality rules getting in the way			0
but perhaps the hardest thing for families of dementia sufferers is watching as their frustrations at being unable to remember things can lead to anger and sometimes aggression			0
and miss @entity1 said it makes her upset to hear of vulnerable people being ‘ hand cuffed and slung in a cell ’ because police officers do n’t know how to deal with them			1
she said : ‘ i ’ve had letters from people saying their loved one has misbehaved in a home , the home has called the doctor , the doctor ’s said call the police and the police come			0
’ miss @entity1 was joined in opening the garden , which marks a partnership between the @entity26 and homes and gardens retailer @entity21 , by sir @entity24 , 79 , whose mother @entity133 developed @entity61 ’s in the years before her death aged 97			1
@entity24 's mother @entity133 developed @entity136 s in the years before her death aged 97 devastatingly , @entity133 suffered such memory loss that she no longer recognised the veteran broadcaster as her son			2
appearing at the flower show with his wife , @entity142 , with whom he has three children , sir @entity24 said : ‘ [ my mother ] did n’t believe i was her son , she thought i was her brother , @entity24			2
she also brought my father back from the dead after several years			0
and she had a girl who came to visit her who she could see and talk to her but i could n’t			0
in the end , the trouble with @entity61 ’s is you lose the parent before they die			0
you have to live with , not a corpse , but a stranger			0
’ the @entity157 - ‘ time to reflect ’ in association with @entity26 was created by award - winning garden designer @entity158 and a team of young gardeners			2
it will remain at the @entity164 ’s @entity39 until the programme ends on saturday .			2

speaks for first time about her own preparations should she develop the disease
the 53 - year - old was speaking at @entity26 garden at @entity39
