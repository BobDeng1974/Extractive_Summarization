by @entity0 sir @entity1 , president of the @entity2 , said police are under increasing pressure to record ' playground high jinx ' as crimes police are under increasing pressure to record ' playground high jinx ' as crimes , one of the country 's most senior officers said last night			1
officers are regularly criticised for not adding petty pranks and boisterous escapades by youngsters to official records , sir @entity1 revealed			1
in one case police dealt with three eight - year - olds caught bearing their bottoms at passing motorists by simply taking them home and informing their parents			1
and in another an officer did the same when he was called to a 10 - year - old boy and a younger friend who were throwing around stolen penny sweets			1
but official inspectors later said both incidents should have been recorded as crimes , potentially triggering a full inquiry , even when the participants could not be prosecuted because they were below the age of criminal responsibility			1
speaking yesterday , sir @entity1 , said the trend is causing ' real frustration ' to chief constables who believe they should have discretion to focus their efforts elsewhere			1
he said : ' the point is less around the individual cases than the impact of a process that obscures the detail and can deliver a false impression of policing that ill informs the public			1
' the aim must be to improve policing and that is best achieved within a profession which has the maturity to discuss and learn , not condemn failures			2
' police crime recording remains in the spotlight after a series of scandals about tricks and cheats used by forces to manipulate all - important figures			2
@entity62 have lambasted forces for ' gaming ' statistics by reclassifying crimes and under - recording serious offences to put a gloss on their performance			2
last year one chief constable broke ranks to admit that an ' obsession ' with reducing crime is leading some officers to manipulate figures			1
sir @entity1 suggested @entity75 , the government - appointed @entity76 , has overcompensated by toughening up the crime - recording regime			1
sir @entity1 said the trend is causing ' real frustration ' to chief constables who believe they should have discretion to focus their efforts elsewhere speaking at the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) annual conference , he said complex policing situations are being over-simplified by bureaucrats			1
he said : ' one chief constable told me that @entity89 's inspectors had challenged him on a set of circumstances involving an officer who responded to a call where three young boys aged eight had chosen to bare their bottoms at passing motorists			2
' he dealt with the matter by escorting the boys home , speaking to the parents and leaving			1
if my eight - year - old had behaved in a similar way i would be entirely satisfied and indeed grateful to the officer			2
' but apparently that should have been recorded as a crime			2
' he added : ' i still remember learning that it was an irrefutable presumption at common law that a child aged under 10 is incapable of committing a crime			0
' an interim report into the crime recording standards of all police forces in @entity113 and @entity114 was published last month and a final version is expected later this year			0
crime records are governed by strict standards laid down by the @entity118 and the @entity119			0
in response a spokesman for @entity76 ( @entity76 ) denied applying pressure to police forces to do ' anything improper '			0
he said : ' the integrity of police recorded crime is important so that police chiefs know the patterns of offending behaviour in their areas , and can deploy their resources with the maximum of efficiency and effectiveness			0
' @entity76 inspects against the rules as they stand			0
there is no question of @entity76 deciding what should and should not be recorded as a crime			0
' making an administrative record of a criminal offence reported by a victim does not and can not criminalise anyone			0
' the choices the police then make in relation to the course of action to be taken are at the discretion of investigating officers and ultimately @entity152			1
' the age of criminal responsibility in @entity113 and @entity114 is ten			0
no criminal proceedings could be taken against an under - age child			0
' it is a common feature in the sphere of public accountability that when entities are held closely and firmly to account , they sometimes dislike and resist it			0
the police service is no different			0
