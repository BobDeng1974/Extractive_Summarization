the official word from @entity1 is that @entity2 is not for sale at the end of the season			1
not to @entity6 , not to anyone			2
@entity2 is one of @entity1 ’s own , a product of the fabled @entity10 academy and an example to young recruits that it is possible to make a first - team breakthrough			1
the reality is that @entity2 will sit with his influential father , @entity16 , at the end of the season to discuss whether a move to @entity6 would enhance his career and not just his bank balance			1
@entity2 takes on @entity22 's @entity21 during the @entity24 game at the @entity25 on tuesday night @entity2 was making his first appearance for the @entity27 since recovering from ankle surgery @entity2 has not featured for the first team since he was injured against @entity30 on november 22 the @entity32 midfielder lays on the @entity34 turf dejected after he suffered an ankle injury whatever manager @entity36 has to say before @entity1 ’s clash with @entity38 on saturday , @entity2 to @entity6 , as revealed in @entity39 on wednesday , is undoubtedly in the works			1
he is on the list of @entity42 , @entity6 ’s director of football			2
at 23 , he is a young @entity43 player who could bring down the average age of this @entity6 squad — if they could prise him from the @entity25			2
it will not be easy			0
@entity2 has always maintained that he wants to remain at @entity1 for the rest of his career			1
@entity6 , though , offer a fresh start and it is possible that @entity2 needs a change of environment after another frustrating season on the sidelines			1
@entity32 manager @entity56 has preferred to deploy @entity2 in a defensive role for the national team @entity6 have snapped up several players from @entity1 in recent times , with varying degrees of success			1
@entity62 transfer fee : £ 7m			1
@entity1 : 1 @entity65 title ( 2003 - 04 ) , 1 @entity66 ( 2005 )			1
man @entity6 : 2 @entity65 titles ( 2011 - 12 , 13 - 14 ) , 1 @entity69 ( 2014 )			2
verdict : decent deal @entity71 fee : £ 15m			0
@entity1 : 1 @entity65 title ( 2003 - 04 ) , 2 @entity74 ( 2003 , 2005 )			2
@entity6 : 1 @entity65 title ( 2011 - 12 ) , 1 @entity66 ( 2011 )			2
verdict : decent deal @entity77 fee : £ 25m			0
verdict : bad buy @entity85 fee : £ 24m			2
man @entity6 : 2 @entity65 titles ( 2011 - 12 , 2013 - 14 ) , 1 @entity69 ( 2014 )			2
verdict : top transfer @entity92 fee : free			0
@entity1 : 1 @entity66 ( 2014 )			0
verdict : decent deal it is also a well - trodden path for @entity1 players in recent seasons , with @entity77 , @entity85 , @entity62 and @entity92 leaving the rhythmic , first - touch football at the @entity25 for super-sized salaries at @entity6			1
it is not an easy decision , particularly with the vulgar salaries on offer at the @entity108 and the inevitable accusations of being a mercenary , but this is key moment in @entity2 ’s career			1
the midfielder is already paid handsomely — £ 130,000 a week all in when he starts for @entity1 — but injuries are a constant source of frustration for @entity2			1
he has not played a first - team game for @entity1 since november 22 , when he was substituted 55 minutes into the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity30 at the @entity25 with an ankle injury			1
in the past , @entity2 has been built up too soon , championed as a future @entity1 and @entity32 captain when he has yet to even make 100 starts for his club in the @entity65			1
even former @entity32 captain @entity123 claimed he had the ability to become one of the best midfielders in the world before he played @entity127 at @entity128 in february 2013			0
‘ @entity129 got a bit of everything			0
he can tackle , pass , get up and down the pitch , create a goal or score a goal , ’ said @entity123 at the time			0
‘ he ticks almost every box , and he ’s going to get better and better			0
he has the potential to become one of the best in the world			0
‘ i do n’t want to put any pressure on him , but having played against him and seen him in training , he ’s a one - off			0
he ’s a lot better than your normal @entity65 midfielder			0
’ the truth is that @entity2 needs time , room to breathe again after being championed ever since he scored that magnificent goal for @entity1 ’s reserve team against @entity151 at @entity153 ’s @entity152 in 2008			1
@entity36 was there that night , grinning with approval in the stands after the 16 - year - old ’s curling left - foot effort confirmed his status as one of the club ’s rising stars			0
he earned instant comparison to @entity164			0
@entity62 ( left ) and @entity85 are just two @entity27 who have left for @entity6 in recent seasons @entity36 's side are currently second in the @entity65 and face @entity38 on saturday since then @entity2 has made the grade with the first team , an established member of a core group of players who are enjoying the club ’s soothing possession football			1
on present form @entity1 are the best team to watch in the @entity65 and @entity176 , recovering from his latest injury , would dearly love to be part of it			2
although dad @entity16 is a @entity151 fan , his son is @entity1 through and through , as he demonstrated after last season ’s dramatic victory over @entity182 in the @entity66			0
during the victory parade , just hours before he joined up with the @entity32 squad to begin preparations for the @entity186 in @entity127 , he mischievously grabbed the microphone to ask the fans : ‘ what do you think of @entity191 ? ’ the answer was well - publicised at the time , but the more pertinent question is whether @entity2 can reclaim his first place in this developing @entity1 team			1
@entity2 could struggle to break into a side containing @entity198 ( left ) and @entity199 next season with @entity32 , manager @entity56 plays him at the base of his midfield diamond , but at @entity36 prefers him in a pairing behind the main attackers			0
with @entity199 , @entity198 , @entity209 and @entity210 the favoured attacking players behind @entity208 , this is not an easy team for @entity2 to get into next season			1
at 23 he has time on his side and even at the end of this season there are still three years to run on his current contract			0
soon enough there will be a decision to be made for all concerned .			0

@entity2 has been linked with a move to @entity6 this *summer*
@entity2 has not played a first - team game for @entity1 since november 22
a host of @entity1 players have *defected* to @entity6 in the past
@entity85 , @entity62 and @entity92 have all moved to the @entity108
read : @entity1 would be *foolish* to dismiss £ *30m* or more for @entity2
