by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 17:51 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 10 may 2013 @entity3 press secretary @entity2 stumbled friday in a routine press briefing that turned ugly , when reporters asked why a @entity8 - approved set of talking points about last year 's terror attack on a @entity12 diplomatic outpost in @entity13 , @entity6 were edited 12 times - seemingly with the influence of @entity17 administration political appointees			1
@entity2 took swipes at @entity19 and faced hostile questions from a press corps that grew impatient with the government 's answers to questions about the sept 11 , 2012 deadly , @entity26 - inspired mayhem			1
many reporters were equally impatient with the @entity28 , which rescheduled the regular daily briefing twice , first holding instead a closed - door background session with 14 selected reporters			0
while @entity2 initially promised that he would remain in the briefing room ' as long as you want ' to answer reporters ' questions , he left abruptly with many hands still in the air			0
responding to questions about whether the @entity17 administration sought to avoid those political consequences , @entity2 took a shot at @entity53 , the president 's opponent			1
the former @entity19 governor of @entity54 , he said , ' put out a press release to try and take political advantage of these deaths			2
' @entity2 quickly corrected himself : ' of the attack in @entity13			2
' at issue is language the @entity8 prepared for the @entity79			0
its initial draft held , in part , that ' we believe ... the attacks in @entity13 were spontaneously inspired ... [ but ] we do know that @entity49 extremists with ties to @entity26 participated in the attack			1
' twelve revisions later , and after emailed input from @entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 , the final version issued sept. 15 read that ' currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in @entity13 were spontaneously inspired ... [ but ] there are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations			2
' all mentions of @entity49 terrorism , @entity26 and the ' attack ' itself were scrubbed from the talking points by the time @entity12 secretary @entity99 blamed the deadly incident on an anti-islam @entity103 video , during five talk show appearances on sept. 16			1
an @entity17 impeachment ? sen. @entity106 ( @entity107 ) and @entity109 columnist @entity108 ( r ) are suggesting that the @entity13 scandal could lead there @entity2 held friday to his previous statements , insisting that the intelligence community was solely responsible for the substantive edits			1
' the @entity8 , in this case deputy director of the @entity8 ... issued a set of talking points on that saturday morning , ' @entity2 said , ' and those talking points were disseminated			1
and the only edit made by the @entity3 or the @entity90 ... was a change in referring to the facility that was attacked as a " consulate " -- because it was not a consulate -- to " diplomatic post			0
" ' but reporters questioned @entity2 's parsing of words , asking if the @entity90 's influence was felt by the @entity8 , which then adapted its talking points to suit political appointees			1
@entity2 said the @entity90 was included in the working group that edited the @entity8 's draft , ' since it was a @entity90 facility that was attacked			1
' @entity2 accused unnamed republicans of leaking a series of emails to @entity136 on friday			0
those communications , the network reported , spell out the trail of edits across 12 separate versions of the talking points			2
the @entity3 , he said , provided the emails in question to the @entity145 months ago , in response to a request related to the confirmation of the incoming @entity8 director , @entity149			0
' the administration took the rather extraordinary step of providing those emails ' to senators ' in late february and through march , ' @entity2 said			0
@entity145 @entity19 voted to confirm @entity149 after seeing ' all of these emails which , of course , now they 've leaked to reporters			0
' @entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 's emails show that the agency , then headed by @entity160 , had a direct hand in suggesting alterations to the official story on the @entity13 terror attack @entity136 uncovered 12 versions of the infamous @entity13 talking points , along with emails suggesting that @entity89 - then @entity160 's chief spokesperson - was chiefly interested in political considerations less than two months before the presidential elections although @entity19 have called on the @entity3 to release unclassified versions of all internal administration emails related to what they term a @entity13 ' cover - up , ' @entity2 said the administration would not comply			1
' @entity178 deliberations are generally protected information , ' he noted			0
the @entity180 includes a list of nine exceptions to government transparency rules , including the provision that ' a privileged inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter ' need not be disclosed			0
but it 's unclear whether that rule applies to @entity190 , or whether @entity19 on @entity191 will drop the now - intensely politicized issue			2
four @entity12 perished in the terror attack on @entity13 , including then - ambassador to @entity6 @entity195			2
he conceded that one feature of the talking points , its claim that spontaneous demonstrations preceded the @entity13 terror attack , turned out to be flawed			1
but reporters focused more on sins of omission on which the @entity3 is now referring questions to the @entity8			0
' you should direct those questions to the intelligence community , ' @entity2 said after one journalist asked whether the @entity8 's first draft - which included references to @entity26 - was accurate before it was edited			1
these bloodstains at the main gate of the @entity12 consulate in @entity13 , @entity6 are believed to belong to an @entity12 staff member			0
four @entity12 personnel , including ambassador @entity195 , died in the sept. 11 , 2012 terror attack the normally unflappable @entity2 seemed to struggle friday to answer questions , in a hostile briefing that was delayed twice and pushed near the end of the work day when most of the day 's news cycle was over it 's an open question whether the @entity3 will be able to rest blame for the ultimately flawed talking points with intelligence agencies despite the @entity90 's now - documented influence over the process			1
but one reporter was heard in the press briefing room after @entity2 departed , speculating about applying the press secretary 's standard of responsibility to his cooking			0
' so if i have this soup recipe that i know is great , and my wife tells me over and over to put different things into it instead , and i do what she asks , and then it turns out awful , whose fault is it ? ' the reporter , who asked not to be named , said			0
indeed , @entity2 said ' no ' when asked if he could deny that the second and subsequent @entity8 drafts of the @entity13 talking points came after input from the @entity90			1
but ' these are talking points , ' he reflected			2

pressure mounts as a @entity19 senator and a liberal columnist both road - test the word ' impeachment '
@entity2 insists the administration 's @entity13 talking points memo reflected the @entity8 's best intelligence
an early @entity8 draft says ' we do know ' an @entity26 influenced group participated in the attack , but the official version omitted terror references
key question : did political appointees direct the @entity8 to change its tune so the president would *n't* look soft on terror just weeks before the election ?
