former model @entity0 is a wealthy woman who knows all about looking after her skin			1
the wife of @entity4 oil tycoon @entity3 , she has tried everything from super-expensive @entity7 moisturisers to the services of the most exclusive @entity10 dermatologists			1
but @entity0 , who ’s originally from @entity11 , @entity12 , has a shocking admission ; she also regularly uses skin - lightening creams to alter the colour of her complexion			1
‘ when my skin is lighter , i just feel prettier , ’ she admits with startling candour			2
‘ it ’s a taboo subject , and people get judgmental about it , but that ’s how i feel			0
’ last month , @entity25 health store @entity24 came under fire for selling a legal skin - whitening product called dr @entity28 , which retails for £ 9.99			1
yet @entity0 , who ’s 34 and lives with her husband and four children in a @entity43 mansion , claims that in some communities the pressure on women to use such products is overwhelming			1
‘ a skin - lightening regime has been part of my life practically since birth , ’ she claims			1
‘ there are many different types of @entity55 skin — from dark charcoal to a lighter version — and you grow up knowing that the lighter ladies are the prettier ones			1
it ’s just a fact			0
’ her younger sister , @entity63 , 27 , agrees , explaining how disturbing hierarchies of skin colour are still influencing @entity55 girls			2
‘ being lighter shows you belong to a different place on the social ladder			0
all the rich , successful black @entity55 men marry either a white or a very light - skinned girl because they too grew up thinking that the lighter is the most pretty			2
it does n’t matter how dark a man is , of course — the pressure is all on women			2
’ @entity78 , 41 , a black television presenter from @entity79 , bought many different products in her increasingly desperate attempt to lighten a patch of dark skin skin lightening is a multi-billion - pound global industry			1
pharmacy shelves groan under the dozens of perfectly legal skin lightening products , from high - end @entity88 and @entity90 to household brands such as @entity92 and @entity93			1
@entity24 , meanwhile , insist their cream is specifically for use on skin blemishes such as ‘ age spots , liver spots , freckles , sun damaged skin and scars ’ , and contains a brown algae called @entity104 , which has ‘ proven skin whitening attributes ’ , according to a spokesman			1
but it ’s not just the ethics of skin lightening that concern campaigners			1
beyond these legal products , there ’s a booming market in illegal creams , soaps and pills , many containing highly damaging ingredients such as mercury , bleach and acid			1
the worst of these , a chemical called hydroquinone , is officially banned in the @entity124 , but can still be prescribed by dermatologists for cosmetic reasons — and is n’t hard to find in the @entity127			0
@entity78 stresses that she uses creams to tackle discolouration rather than to change the colour of her skin overall ‘ anybody can use it , and everybody does , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ just look at all the pop stars whose skin has got so much lighter over the years			2
we ’re just turning a blind eye to it			0
’ essentially a bleaching agent , hydroquinone is the biological equivalent of paint stripper			0
in removing the top layer of skin , which initially results in a ‘ brighter ’ looking face , it also removes the body ’s natural defence against infection and the sun , increasing the risk of skin cancer			2
if it enters the bloodstream , it can cause fatal liver and kidney damage			0
skincare expert @entity160 , who founded her clinic @entity161 in @entity162 30 years ago , has treated many women desperate to reverse the chemical ’s effects			0
‘ some women develop hide - like skin around their eyes when they had hoped that hydroquinone preparations would treat their dark circles			1
others get a kind of spotted , caviar - like effect on their skin			2
’ the @entity175 lists a terrifying catalogue of potential side - effects resulting from the use of illegal skin creams , including foetal abnormalities in pregnant women who use preparations containing mercury and thinning of the skin due to high - dose steroid creams			1
@entity78 , 41 , a black television presenter from @entity79 , bought many different products in her increasingly desperate attempt to lighten a patch of dark skin			1
‘ i had this blistering under my eye , which left me with what looked like a permanent black eye , ’ she says			2
‘ obviously i was very self - conscious about it			0
people kept asking me what was wrong			0
so when i found this cream in an @entity200 market , i bought it , though i had no idea what was in it			2
in the end i tried all sorts of creams , some legal and some not			2
the thing is , they absolutely did make a difference to the darker patches around my eyes , so there was no incentive to stop			0
’ @entity78 stresses that she uses creams to tackle discolouration rather than to change the colour of her skin overall , yet , like @entity0 , she defends the right of black women to use lightening products to even out skin tone			1
‘ we bleach our hair , after all , ’ she says			0
‘ i simply do n’t understand the fuss about this @entity24 cream			1
’ @entity224 , born in @entity225 of @entity227 origin , launched his own fully above - board range of skin lightening creams ten years ago , and claims that women want paler skin to emulate film and pop stars			1
‘ the @entity236 film industry is one of the reasons that people continue to think that fairer is more beautiful , ’ he says			0
but this focus on skin colour goes well beyond fashion			0
‘ in @entity249 communities , ’ he continues , ‘ when a photograph of a potential bride is passed around , the first thing noticed is their skin colour			0
’ ‘ people say : “ she ’s quite dark , ” before any education credentials are looked at , for example			0
’ @entity78 says ‘ i simply do n’t understand the fuss about this @entity24 cream ’ the main agent in @entity224 ’s @entity258 range is a synthetic compound called alpha arbutin , which inhibits the production of the skin pigment melanin			1
but it does n’t come cheap			0
the most popular product in his range sells at an eye - popping £ 97 per bottle			0
‘ our customers are more than 90 per cent female and split equally between @entity249 and black consumers , ’ he says			0
@entity224 , 32 , says he has more than 100,000 customers worldwide ; and he practises what he preaches , using the products on his own skin with startling results according to pictures on his website			2
it is not a habit without risks , he admits , but only when women fail to follow instructions and misuse the creams			0
‘ the danger of @entity258 is that it can become addictive as people start seeing the effects and want to use more and more			0
one customer poured more than 100 bottles of the skin lightening cream into the bath , hoping they would lighten quicker			1
’ despite the already dramatic change in her skin colour , @entity298 , for one , would go paler still			2
‘ it ’s my choice			0
i would never judge a white woman for choosing to tan her skin , ’ she says			0
meanwhile , @entity0 ’s reaction to the controversy surrounding the @entity24 skin lightening cream was simple — she went out and stocked up			1
‘ it ’s early days , so i ca n’t really report on how effective it is yet , ’ she says			0
in a bid for celebrity status , the sisters have launched their own pop group and freely admit this career choice further fuels their desire to be pale			0
‘ i think every woman is free to do what she wants , ’ says @entity0 , ‘ and personally , i feel more like me when my skin is lighter			1
’ but @entity0 and @entity63 are n’t alone			2
and as the global entertainment industry presents an ever - more standardised version of the female ideal , the skin lightening craze will only continue .			1
