getting children to open up about sexual abuse , particularly when it involves a family member , is notoriously difficult			2
so one artist , going under the name of @entity6 , has incorporated @entity8 princesses into his message to young victims - a visual language he hopes will better speak to them			1
' the aim of the poster series is to encourage victims to report their cases in order for the authorities to prevent it from happening again , ' the artist , who is based in the @entity13 , told @entity20			1
powerful message : artist @entity6 aims to encourage young victims of incest and sexual abuse to report their attacks , with posters including this one , which shows @entity29 from @entity30 kissing her father the impactful posters see three iconic @entity8 characters - @entity34 from @entity35 , @entity29 from @entity30 , and princess @entity36 from @entity37 - engaged in uncomfortable lip - locks with their fathers			1
' i recently learned that one of my closest friends was molested by her father when she was seven , ' @entity40 explains			1
' it took her 14 years to be able to share that traumatizing experience , and that story shocked me to my core			0
' he goes on : ' as an artist and activist , i decided to shed light on that topic again in a new form			1
i used @entity8 princess because it 's a visual language that my targeted audience would be attracted to			0
' @entity58 character ? the artist says he cast @entity8 princesses for his campaign because ' it 's a visual language that my targeted audience would be attracted to ' @entity6 says that before going public with the campaign , he tried reaching out to a major organization he hoped might use it for good , but never heard back			1
so he published the work on his own , after which a number of other foundations which fight child sexual abuse and incest shared the images			2
the project has sparked mixed responses			0
one commenter from @entity77 's site wrote : ' [ @entity78 ] now get to have a favorite cartoon , childhood escapism , associated with incest			2
' another wrote : ' creepy and disturbing without being actually helpful			0
' but others see it differently , with one supporter musing : ' choosing @entity8 princesses for this campaign actually makes a lot of sense ... because of the familiarity of the characters ( in both senses of the word ) , these images are creepy and uncomfortable , which is exactly what they need to be			2
' twist : in the original version of @entity35 , written in the 16th century , the princess is actually raped by a @entity97 during her 100 year slumber , unbeknownst to most @entity8 fans @entity6 says that today , just one day after publishing the posters , they have already made a monumental difference to at least one girl			1
' i received an email from a girl thanking me for the project and telling me that she decided to report her father after seeing the posters			1
i actually cried , ' he reveals			0
' you have no idea how glad i am now that i actually published the series			0
if the posters could change one person 's life , then it 's worth it			2
' interestingly , one of the @entity8 characters he used for the campaign turns out to be a more salient choice than he previously knew			2
' [ one girl ] told me that she decided to report her father after seeing the posters			1
i actually cried ' in the original story of @entity35 , which was written in the 16th century , the princess is n't woken by the kiss from a prince at all			0
while she is asleep , a passing @entity97 rapes her and she subsequently births twins			0
the princess is actually awoken by one of her children , finding herself in a decidedly different predicament than she does in later versions of the story			0
@entity6 is based in the @entity13 , and works under a pseudonym to protect himself and his provocative campaigns , in a region which enforces strict censorship			1
his previous work has seen cartoon characters from @entity37 appearing on ' denied ' visa applications from the @entity143 , as well as representations of political figures ; including @entity146 as @entity149 's @entity148 character and @entity150 as @entity152 's @entity151 in @entity153			0
he says he received ' a lot of threats ' after he produced an image of @entity157 in @entity158 describes his work broadly as : ' combining pop art with tyrants and world leaders			0

artist @entity6 created the posters after learning that his friend had been molested by her father at aged seven
one victim of incest has already been moved to report her attack after seeing the campaign
