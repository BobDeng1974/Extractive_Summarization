by @entity0 teenagers who play violent computer games such as @entity5 are more likely to drink , smoke and have unprotected sex , psychologists have found			1
games that glorify risky behaviour can encourage adolescents to become more rebellious and seek out thrills themselves , according to a new study			0
scientists tracked 5,000 @entity15 teenagers for four years , and found a distinct correlation between the frequency that they played violent games and their behaviour			1
teenagers who play violent computer games such as @entity5 ( pictured ) are more likely to drink , smoke and have unprotected sex , psychologists at @entity25 in @entity26 have found they discovered that those who often played adult - rated games were more likely to smoke , drink and become aggressive			1
the teenagers , who were aged 13 and ten months on average when the experiment started , were also more likely to go on , within four years , to display delinquent behaviour such as petty theft , starting fights or running away from home			1
those who played violent games were also more likely to have first had sex at a younger age , more likely to have caught a sexually transmitted disease , and more likely to have had unprotected sex			2
the changes in behaviour , which were similar for boys and girls , increased in magnitude over time , the scientists found			0
separate research published yesterday by @entity48 suggests that playing video games for less than an hour a day can lead to children becoming better adjusted			0
that study , published in the journal @entity53 - which did not differentiate violent and non-violent games - found that young people who indulged in a little video game - playing were more sociable and more satisfied than those who had never played or who used video games for three hours or more			1
the study involved nearly 5,000 young people , half male and half female , drawn from a nationally representative study of @entity64 households			0
research dr @entity65 said : ' these results support recent laboratory - based experiments that have identified the downsides to playing electronic games			0
however , high levels of video game - playing appear to be only weakly linked to children 's behavioural problems in the real world			1
' @entity5 , a phenomenally successful game now in its fifth edition , involves stealing cars and driving at excessive speeds to evade police cars , with extra points for knocking over innocent bystanders or committing other crimes			0
other violent games linked by the scientists to deviant behaviour include @entity87 - a psychological horror video game - and @entity90 , in which a comic - book superhero beats up villains			1
the scientists , from @entity25 in the @entity15 , said the violent characters in the video games appear to affect how adolescents think of themselves , with consequences for their alter ego in the real world			1
the study , published in the @entity102 , follows a 2012 @entity25 study that suggested that such video games may lead teens to drive recklessly and drink and drive			2
professor @entity106 , who worked on the study , said : ‘ up to now , studies of video games have focused primarily on their effects on aggression and violent behaviours			2
‘ this study is important because it is the first to suggest that possible effects of violent video games go well beyond violence to apply to substance use , risky driving and risk - taking sexual behaviour			2
’ his colleague professor @entity121 , quoting a 1960s @entity15 actor , said : ‘ with respect to playing deviant video game characters , we feel it best to follow the admonition of @entity128 in @entity129 : “ we are what we pretend to be , so we must be careful about what we pretend to be			2
” ’ the authors suggested that changes in behaviour following protracted game play was down to alterations in the users ’ personality , attitudes and values , making them more rebellious and thrill seeking			0
other violent games linked by the scientists to deviant behaviour include manhunt - a psychological horror video game - and @entity90 ( pictured ) , in which a comic - book superhero beats up villains they wrote : ‘ across a wide variety of measures , mature - rated risk - glorifying gameplay was associated with deviant adolescent risk behaviour including excessive alcohol use , cigarette smoking , aggression , delinquency , and risky sex			1
the authors added : ‘ character - based video games provide an opportunity to practice being someone else			0
as a result , the behavioural consequences of playing such games are potentially much broader than the specific kinds of behaviours enacted in the game			0
’ playing video games is not necessary all bad , however			0
separate research published yesterday by @entity48 suggests that playing video games for less than an hour a day can lead to children becoming better adjusted			0
that study , published in the journal @entity53 - which did not differentiate violent and non-violent games - found that young people who indulged in a little video game - playing were more sociable and more satisfied with their lives compared with those who had never played or who used video games for three hours or more .			1

this is according to a study of 5,000 @entity15 teenagers by @entity25
other violent games linked by the scientists to deviant behaviour include @entity87 - a psychological horror video game - and @entity90
teenage fans of games are more likely to smoke , drink and be aggressive
within 4 years , the study found behaviour included petty theft and fights
study says violent characters affect how teenagers think of themselves
this , they believe , has consequences for their alter ego in the real world
