a former @entity1 reporter claims that a ' government - related agency ' hacked her laptop and planted spyware and classified documents in a new book			1
@entity7 , who was with @entity1 , says an outside source with a government agency confirmed the breach and discovered the documents hidden in her computer			1
the @entity13 reports that an ' otherwise innocuous email ' landed in @entity7 's inbox in early 2012 that was loaded with spyware			1
she claims the second time she met her source , he gave her a run down of everything the government had planted on her computer , including keylogging software			0
' the intruders discovered my @entity39 account handle , stole the password , activated the audio , and made heavy use of it , presumably as a listening tool , ' she writes in her book			0
worse than anything @entity49 ever did			0
i would n’t have believed something like this could happen in the @entity53 , ' she says the source told her			0
worse , and in some ways stranger , she claims the source found three classified documents ' buried deep ' her operating system where most users would not have known to access			1
' they probably planted them to be able to accuse you of having classified documents if they ever needed to do that at some point , ' the source said , according to @entity7			1
novel : her revelations claim to show there is a liberal bias in the news media as a whole that excuses the @entity21 administration @entity1 had confirmed that @entity7 's laptop was hacked back in 2013 , when it announced an unnamed cybersecurity firm had conducted a forensic analysis of the computer			1
' @entity7 's computer was accessed by an unauthorized , external , unknown party on multiple occasions in late 2012 , ' the network said			2
' while no malicious code was found , forensic analysis revealed an intruder had executed commands that appeared to involve search and exfiltration of data			0
' ' this party also used sophisticated methods to remove all possible indications of unauthorized activity , and alter system times to cause further confusion , ' the announcement stated			0
the reporter also claimed to have recorded video of documents being edited in front of her eyes , but this is the first time anyone involved has tied the breach to a specific individual or entity			0
@entity7 , who is now senior independent contributor for @entity111 , a media channel for conservative think tank @entity113 , frames her book around this hacking attempt			0
in it , she also says that her employer , @entity117 , would kill stories or direct her away from lines of reporting critical of the @entity21 administration			1
@entity7 writes a colleague told her that one executive wanted stories about failing green energy companies on the @entity125 , but then - executive producer @entity126 did not agree			0
when told that the stories would be ' pretty significant , ' @entity126 retorted , ' what ’s the matter , do n’t you support green energy ? ' @entity131 also claims one of her superiors made it a rule to explicitly label conservatives as such , but that liberals and left - wing analysts were not called out			0
apparently saving the details for the book , @entity7 says a conservative analyst who was far afield of her boss 's personal views would be labeled ' right wing ' in scripts			2
another issue @entity7 points out is that @entity1 president @entity147 has a glaring conflict of interest with the @entity21 administration , as his brother @entity150 is @entity151			1
nasty emails to @entity150 and @entity147 would apparently be sent when the network aired something distasteful to the administration , according to @entity7			2
@entity1 reporters have still gone after the @entity21 administration in the past — a 60 minutes report from @entity159 about the unpreparedness of consular security in @entity162 retracted after its primary source was determined to be a fraud			1
for @entity7 though , the digging was too little too late , and she left the network in 2014 , unsatisfied with what she saw as liberal excuses for the administration 's actions .			2

@entity7 claimed that her laptop was breached in 2012
an outside source with a government agency confirmed the breach , and said hackers planted spyware and classified documents
@entity7 's new book , stonewalled , details the hack along with ways the @entity21 administration *harassed* her during reporting
she also *blames* @entity1 for being willing to kill stories that were critical of government or *controversial*
a conflict of interest with @entity1 president @entity147 , whose brother is part of the @entity21 administration , also *complicated* reporting
