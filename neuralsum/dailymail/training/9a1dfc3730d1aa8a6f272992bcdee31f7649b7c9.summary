an eight - year - old boy - nicknamed ' @entity0 ' by his friends - has grown a second row of teeth after suffering from a condition known as ' paediatric shark teeth '			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , must spend extra time brushing and visiting the dentist to maintain his two sets after his baby teeth did not fall out when his permanent teeth pushed through the gums			1
and @entity7 's condition also means he has suffered the cruel misfortune of not losing a tooth before growing too old to believe in the tooth fairy			1
however , he did lose his first baby tooth last week and it is hoped it will signal the start of normality for @entity7			2
' it looked really odd , and they kept on coming			0
all the while he was n't losing his baby teeth			2
' what was actually happening inside @entity7 's mouth was that his permanent teeth , which would usually help push out baby teeth , were coming through			1
but instead they came in behind the first teeth and failed to move the baby ones out			2
so while his older sister , @entity42 , 10 , and younger brother , @entity44 , six , were cashing in on the tooth fairy , @entity7 was getting frustrated			0
she said : ' it did bother him			0
it does n't hurt and he has no problems eating but he would complain and wish his teeth would come out whenever they lost a tooth			0
he would try and wiggle and wiggle his teeth to make them come out but nothing ever happened			0
' but he 's got used to it now			0
his friends call him ' @entity0 ' because he 's got a second set of teeth just like sharks do			1
' @entity7 's first permanent tooth came through about a year ago , with the others following shortly after			1
the eight - year - old 's first permanent tooth came through about a year ago , with the others following shortly after both she and @entity7 's father , engineer @entity64 , 45 , from @entity65 , @entity9 , were pleased when he finally lost his first baby tooth			1
she said : ' we gave him Â£ 10 to a-bait him			0
it 's funny because he 's so old now he does n't even believe in the tooth fairy anymore			0
' @entity7 is such a showman that if anybody asks about his teeth , he is happy to show them			2
the footy - mad lad is now on a waiting list to get his baby teeth extracted to allow other adult to come through			1
he will then more than likely need a brace			0
but , she said : ' unfortunately there is now a good two or three year wait to see the orthodontist			0
all children are born with 20 teeth know as the child 's baby , or milk , teeth			1
these teeth usually start breaking through the gums and exposing when the child is about 6 - months - old			2
they remain in the child 's formative years but begin to fall out when they reach the age of five or six - often with the first to arrive being the first to go			1
as they start falling out , they are replaced by permanent teeth breaking through the gums			2
these remain with the child for the rest of their life			0
permanent teeth are more yellow than baby teeth and they have longer roots			1
they also feature things called mamelons - these are the bumps on the edge of the permanent teeth which give them a serrated appearance			2
' we have been told we can go private if we chose but i imagine that may cost a lot of money			0
' it is something i 'd like to sort out sooner rather than later , though , because although it does n't hurt and he has no trouble eating it is starting to affect his speech slightly because he has too many teeth in his mouth			0
' the condition - known as paediatric shark teeth - can affect as many as one in 10 children although it is thought not many cases are as striking as @entity7 's			1
it occurs when an adult tooth does n't exert enough pressure on the baby tooth it is under , or does not have enough room to emerge			0
it then takes the easier route and grows behind the baby teeth - causing the baby tooth root to take longer to dissolve and the child is left with two sets of teeth .			1

@entity9 eight - year - old suffers from ' paediatric shark teeth ' condition
@entity7 's friends at *school* have now nicknamed him ' @entity0 '
the problem occurs when child 's permanent teeth fail to push out baby teeth
@entity7 is expected to have two rows of teeth for another three years
