a bright - eyed young girl sits on the set of a tv studio , conducting one of her first ever interviews after being selected from a crop of nationwide hopefuls to win a prestigious modelling contract			0
undeniably beautiful and destined for greatness , the 13 - year - old 's selection as a magazine cover girl has already drawn criticism from media groups as being little more than paedophilia			0
facing some difficult questions for someone her age - she has just turned 14 after her competition win - she is asked by reporter @entity19 if there is anything she would not consider doing in her future career as a model			0
i love being with people and i love fashion ' the young girl 's feelings are quite clear on the subject , saying : ' i wo n't be doing any lingerie shots or anything like that			0
' the year was 1997 and the teenage girl is @entity26 , who would go on to be one of the world 's most recognised lingerie models			0
the clip was featured in @entity53 channel @entity52 programme on tuesday night , which offered a unique insight into the model 's family life			1
ten years later : @entity26 of course went on to be one of @entity62 's secrets most celebrated models , seen here on the catwalk in @entity66 in 2007 at least there 's no lingerie : @entity26 bares almost all in a shoot for @entity70 it did not deliver the anticipated answer to why @entity26 's close - knit family now feels that it has been shut out of the model 's day - to - day life			1
they claim they have not seen @entity26 or her son @entity78 for more than a year - not since the break - up of her marriage to @entity82 star @entity81			1
but even her earliest of interviews provided a hint that @entity26 wanted to leave her country upbringing behind for the bright lights of the world 's biggest cities			1
@entity19 asks @entity26 why she wants to be a model at all , and her answer is simple : ' i just think it 's be really fun			0
i love being with people and i love fashion			0
' in @entity95 : @entity96 and @entity97 spoke warmly of how the family were all together in the norht - eastern @entity100 town , and how they yearned for that family closeness again when @entity19 asks ' and you like the idea of travelling ' , the answer is an immediate and resounding ' @entity106 ! '			2
in tuesday night 's documentary , it was clear that the rest of the @entity97 family did not share their famous family member 's desire to see the world			1
the show started with @entity26 's mother and father - @entity96 and @entity97 - reminiscing about the simple life in @entity95 , a town in @entity100 ( 300 miles from @entity120 )			1
throughout the interview they , as well as @entity26 's grandmother @entity122 , are at pains to show that they are still country folk who extol the virtues of a simple life			1
grandmother and brother : @entity122 says she fears that her great - grandson is missing out on important family time , while @entity134 says both @entity26 and their mother @entity96 are both women who like to be in control @entity97 especially made his feelings clear , saying he wished @entity26 had never gone into modelling and that she had married a ' nobody ' instead of someone famous			1
he almost proudly told the story that he did n't know who @entity81 was when told his daughter had started up a relationship , adding : ' i 'd heard the name ... i 'm not one for movies			2
' he added : ' after what i know now i would rather she did just marry a nobody because you really ca n't get that family time by yourself			2
' and on the topic of his grandson @entity78 , his hopes were once again homespun ones			1
happy families : an undated photograph handed out by the @entity52 ahead of the @entity52 programme shows the @entity163 - @entity134 , @entity26 , @entity96 and @entity97 - after one of @entity26 's many early successes grown up : @entity134 , @entity26 , @entity96 and @entity97 are older in this photo , and @entity26 has clearly grown into the beautiful looks that would take her around the world - and away from her family he said : ' what i 'd like to do as a grandfather would be to teach @entity78 how to milk a cow , ride a horse , those country things			1
' similarly , @entity26 's grandmother @entity122 lamented the fact that she had n't seen @entity78 , now three , as often as she would have liked			1
she said : ' i miss the baby and i think he 's missing out on family , that closeness that we have always had			2
it 's very nice where they are but nothing like @entity53 , nothing , and i think hopefully @entity78 might end up here			1
we just keep our fingers crossed			0
' a source tells @entity190 , however , that @entity26 does stay close to her family			1
' @entity26 is totally committed to her family and in regular contact , she recently flew out her cousins to so they could spend @entity193 together , ' said the friend			2
' @entity26 directly employs her dad , brother , aunt and uncle			0
her career was never going to keep her in @entity53 , to flourish she had to venture overseas , like many aspiring @entity53 models do			0
' @entity26 's connection to @entity53 is incredibly important to her and the documentary is not representative of her life			2
' she does a remarkable job balancing an incredibly successful career with being a loving and dedicated mother			0
' with son @entity78 : @entity26 is seen with @entity96 and @entity122 at @entity207 in may 2012 reflecting ? @entity26 posted this old shot of herself and her mother and grandmother on her @entity211 in december			1
the model has made no public remarks about her deteriorating relationship with either the documentary touched on a possible explanation behind a family rift that has rent her once - close - knit family			2
in 2012 , @entity26 took over control of the @entity221 skincare line , created by her but managed by mother @entity96			0
@entity26 made clear to all - including her family and those involved in her modelling career - that now that she was 30 , she would be taking greater control of her life			1
separated : the @entity97 family say they have n't seen @entity26 or her son @entity78 for over a year @entity97 spoke of his wife 's determination and ambition , saying that ' she can get very blinkered ' when going for something she wanted			1
@entity26 's younger brother @entity134 added that mother and daughter were the same in that they both ' like to be in control ... they 're leaders '			2
since parting ways with @entity221 , @entity96 has created her own called divine by @entity244 , and says that while she realises her daughter 's fame has helped get the ' message out ' , it has perhaps come at a cost to her family			1
breaking the news : @entity97 , pictured here with his daughter and @entity252 in august 2012 , says it was the actor who confirmed to him the news of the couple 's separation last year , over the telephone ' you have to be in the media to be able to get your message out , but then our little @entity263 does n't know what it 's like to walk outside without paparazzi , ' she said			2
@entity96 , who said she used to speak to her daughter every single day , was teary as she explained how she had to eventually ' let go ' of @entity26			0
she said : ' what i have had to do is let go , and allow her to be assertive and lead her own life and i guess for any mum that 's a little bit challenging sometimes to do that			0
' missing his grandson : @entity97 says he hopes that @entity78 grows up and wants to be with his ' nan and pop ' @entity96 said she now sent texts to @entity26 to remind her that she was always there for her , but as she was filmed doing so during the documentary , they were not always immediately reciprocated			1
she said : ' we have been best friends for most of our life			0
we used to talk just about every day			0
' i send her messages , just little texts to say " i love you honey , let your little light shine , my arms are wrapped around you "			0
' sexy selfie : @entity26 posted this racy selfie on thursday during what appeared to be a modelling shot before @entity26 moved to @entity66 at the age of 25 , her parents say they told the then budding supermodel ' the day you think you 're better than anyone else is the day you do n't model under our guidance '			0
@entity96 said these days her daughter 's life was completely different , but it was important to stand ' true '			1
she said : ' @entity26 's life is so different now [ and ] she 's surrounded by yes people all the time			0
it 's so important for me to be real , to be true , to be who she needs me to be			0
