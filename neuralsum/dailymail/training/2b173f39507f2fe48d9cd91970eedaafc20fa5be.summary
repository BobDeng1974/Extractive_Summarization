@entity0 tried to end @entity2 ’s disastrous ‘ elitism ’ row yesterday by insisting he admires the working classes			1
@entity6 ’s second poll victory over the @entity7 had been eclipsed by a @entity2 frontbencher apparently sneering at a white van driver whose modest home is decked with @entity12 flags			1
mr @entity0 bizarrely declared he felt ‘ respect ’ on seeing a white van and insisted it was right for @entity15 to resign over her tweet			2
some of his mps said miss @entity15 ’s gaffe was ‘ horrendous ’ while others claimed he was playing into @entity33 hands by asking her to quit			1
on a dramatic day at @entity34 : the furore over @entity36 , mp for @entity37 and @entity38 , erupted after she tweeted the picture of @entity41 ’s home while campaigning in @entity42			2
when accused of sneering , she claimed she had ‘ never seen anything like ’ the house and said her critics were prejudiced against @entity37 , which has become a byword for champagne socialism			0
but mr @entity0 was said to have exploded in fury when he heard about miss @entity15 ’s tweet , first ordering her to apologise and later telling her to stand down as shadow attorney general			2
gaffe : @entity15 , the mp for upmarket @entity37 and @entity38 , tweeted this image from @entity42 yesterday leading to accusations of snobbery @entity56 turned up at ms @entity58 's £ 3million home in @entity37 and accused her of being a ' snob ' labour strategists had hoped a @entity6 landslide in @entity42 would mark the moment that pressure switched on to mr @entity64 and away from mr @entity0 , who has endured weeks of speculation about his leadership			1
but with @entity6 ’s win narrower than expected , a result likely to deter further potential defectors who want to keep their commons seats after next may ’ s election , there was little sign of @entity33 disunity			1
instead , @entity2 was riven over whether mr @entity0 ’s treatment of @entity36 had been over the top and how it should counter the threat to its working - class vote from @entity6			1
her treatment was particularly brutal , given that she was the first mp to nominate him for the party leadership			0
however aides said mr @entity0 was ‘ angrier than he has ever been ’			2
humiliated : while miss @entity15 initially apologised over the picture , she stood down as shadow attorney general just hours later after speaking with a ' furious ' @entity0 some senior figures privately accused the @entity2 leader of overreacting because of his own sensitivity about accusations made earlier this month in the traditionally supportive @entity93 magazine that he is an ‘ old - style @entity95 socialist ’			1
‘ @entity0 ’s abandoned an ally when his enemies have survived far worse , ’ one source said			2
miss @entity15 said : ‘ i made a mistake , i ’ve resigned and if i ’ve upset anyone or insulted anyone i apologise			0
’ mr @entity0 insisted : ‘ i ’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect			0
' that ’s not my view , that ’s not @entity2 ’s view , it ’s wrong , it never will be our view , and that is why i think it is right that she resigned			0
’ asked what he thought when he sees a white van outside a house , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ what is going through my mind is respect			0
' @entity123 is the basic rule of politics and i ’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect			0
there is nothing unusual or odd , as her tweet implied , with having an @entity12 flag in your window			0
’ mr @entity64 said : ‘ @entity15 is one of @entity0 ’s closest allies and aides			1
effectively what this means is that @entity0 ’s @entity2 sneers at people who work hard , who are patriotic and who love their country			2
’ mr @entity142 said @entity2 voters looking at the party ’s leadership would not recognise them as ‘ members of their own tribe ’			1
@entity2 mp @entity150 said : ‘ it was horrendous			0
it insults people like me , it insults the people i know – my friends and family – @entity2 voters across the country because white vans , @entity12 flags , they ’re @entity2 values			0
’ @entity160 , a former @entity2 frontbencher , said : ‘ lots of people around the country suspect the country is run or politics is run by an out - of - touch metropolitan elite that does n’t understand anything about their lives , does n’t understand the pressure they ’re under , does n’t care about their concerns , and sneers at them			0
’ but @entity2 ’s @entity172 said he did not think miss @entity15 should have quit : ‘ she ’s not a stranger to council housing – it ’s where she comes from			1
it does n’t sound to me like a resignation scandal			0
’ though it held the seat for 13 years until 2010 , @entity2 put little effort into the contest in @entity42 , triggered by the defection to @entity6 of former @entity33 mp @entity182 , who won it for his new party .			1

@entity186 split after @entity0 orders @entity15 to stand down
some branded gaffe ' horrendous ' while others called her treatment *unfair*
aides said @entity0 was ' angrier than he has ever been ' after news broke
the full scale of the *doomed* @entity33 attempt to hold @entity42 was laid bare , with *cabinet* ministers making 100 visits ;
@entity142 claimed @entity2 had shown itself to be ‘ *anti-english* ’ and @entity6 was now the party of the working class ;
a potential @entity33 defector *welcomed* @entity6 ’s new mp back to @entity34 and sided with the party in an @entity208 vote ;
@entity64 was urged by @entity33 mps to *toughen* his stance on the @entity212 and *immigration* ;
the @entity215 suffered their worst ever result , finishing fifth with just *349* votes .
