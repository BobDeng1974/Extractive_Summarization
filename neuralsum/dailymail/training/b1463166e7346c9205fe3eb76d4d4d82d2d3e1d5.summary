by @entity1 reporter published : 12:46 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 02:32 est , 10 may 2012 a former campaign spokeswoman for @entity3 broke down on the stand today as she described how close friend @entity5 told her one of her fears of dying was that there would be no man there who loved her			1
@entity11 , who is now deputy communications director for president @entity12 , also told the @entity14 court about the time @entity5 angrily confronted a key donor about his support for the presidential candidate 's pregnant mistress in 2007 at a hotel in @entity21			1
she said the candidate had called her to the @entity24 , @entity21 , hotel room where his wife was arguing with campaign finance chairman @entity26 and his wife about the couple 's financial help to @entity30			1
@entity31 had become close friends with @entity5 , and her husband hoped her presence could help calm the situation			1
worried : @entity31 , right , @entity3 ' chief spokesman during @entity5 ' 2004 presidential run , arrives at a federal courthouse in @entity14 , today to testify and left @entity5 with his daughter @entity38 witness : @entity40 , who once wrote speeches for @entity3 , enters the federal courthouse today after detailing conversations she had with @entity5 in july 2009 about whether he should issue a statement saying he had fathered @entity47 's child she said she eventually distanced herself from the former candidate after he acknowledged the affair in an august 2008 television interview because he had n't been truthful about the baby he had with his mistress			1
the former aide later began crying while discussing her friendship with @entity5 who she had grown close to while working with her husband			1
@entity31 was with the @entity5 family when @entity5 died in december of 2010 after battling cancer			2
she broke down in tears describing what @entity5 said : ' she was concerned that when she died , there would not be a man who loved her there , ' @entity31 said , though she noted that @entity3 was there in the end			1
that day in @entity21 in october of 2007 , @entity31 said @entity26 's wife , @entity65 , admitted to @entity5 that she had flown @entity47 to @entity66 for a shopping trip			1
' you 've got to hold your friends close and your enemies closer , ' @entity31 quoted @entity71 as telling the enraged wife			0
@entity71 added that @entity47 was a ' loose cannon ' who could have exposed the affair to the media , @entity31 said			2
at the time , a tabloid was publishing an article about the affair , and @entity31 said the campaign was absorbed with keeping the story from crossing over into the mainstream media			0
@entity5 had told his wife he had a brief fling with @entity47 , but that he had ended the affair many months earlier , according to earlier testimony			1
in fact , @entity5 had continued the affair and @entity47 was then pregnant with his child			1
a close aide to @entity5 , @entity92 , had rented the mistress a home a few miles away from the @entity5 family estate in @entity96			2
the candidate had kept the arrangement secret from his wife			0
team : defense lawyers for @entity3 , @entity101 , left , and @entity102 , right , enter a federal courthouse today to continue questioning the witnesses witness : former @entity5 donor @entity106 , center , arrives today for his second day of testimony in the trial against @entity5 and is the first person to mention the sex tape @entity31 said @entity5 could n't comprehend why @entity26 and @entity71 would have any contact with @entity47			1
' she did n't understand why they were embracing her , spending time with her , ' @entity31 said			0
asked what @entity5 was doing during the argument , @entity31 said she did n't remember him saying much			2
' he was more of a spectator than a participant , ' she testified			0
how much @entity5 knew about the money spent in the effort to cover up his affair is a critical question at his trial			2
@entity5 has pleaded not guilty to six counts for campaign finance violations related to about $ 1 million in secret payments from @entity26 and 101 - year - old heiress @entity132			1
@entity5 has denied knowing about the money , much of which was used to hide the pregnant mistress as he campaigned for the @entity137			2
@entity26 flew @entity47 across the country in his private jet , paid for stays in luxury resorts and secured a $ 20,000 - a - month rental mansion in @entity143			1
glare of the media : everyday since the beginning of his trial @entity3 has had his daughter @entity38 by his side on tuesday , campaign speechwriter @entity40 testified that @entity5 had later admitted to her he knew ' all along ' that @entity26 had been supporting his mistress and baby			1
the girl was born in february 2008 a few weeks after he suspended his presidential campaign after poor showings in the early primary states			0
that contradicts what @entity5 has said about his knowledge of the money , most notably in a nationally televised network interview in august 2008			2
during an initial phone call , she said @entity5 told her that he had wanted to tell the truth since november 2008 but had been hampered by things at home			2
' he acknowledged that @entity170 was his daughter and that he 'd always known she was his daughter , ' @entity40 testified			0
' he said that it was wrong for him to deny her			0
' on wednesday , @entity5 ' defense lawyer @entity173 admitted his client had ' lied quite extensively ' in that interview , saying he had only a brief sexual relationship with @entity47 and denying he fathered her baby			1
@entity31 said she had advised @entity3 against doing the interview , which came shortly after tabloid reporters photographed @entity5 visiting his mistress and baby at a @entity183 hotel			1
' i said i did not want him doing the interview if he was going to lie , ' @entity31 recounted			0
' even i did n't believe what he was saying			0
' but @entity31 said @entity5 decided to go ahead anyway after his wife pressed him to make a public statement denying the baby was his			2
yesterday : @entity106 testified that he retrieved possessions of @entity30 's from a rented house in @entity96 that included a signed picture of @entity5			1
the picture was signed : ' i love you , @entity3 ' benefactor : @entity196 and @entity197 seen circa 1987			0
bunny is now blind and a recluse in an attempt to mitigate the damage , @entity31 said she selected @entity203 's nightline as the venue for the interview because the news show was going up that night against the opening ceremony of the @entity208 on rival @entity209 , which was expected to get far bigger ratings			0
' if @entity3 could n't do the interview and tell the truth , it was a mistake , ' @entity31 said			0
' i did n't think it would be great if the whole country watched			0
' after the interview , @entity31 said she asked a friend of @entity5 ' to deliver him a message that she did n't want him to call her for help any more			0
' i believed @entity3 was continuing to lie and trying to drag me into it , ' @entity31 said			0
the government says the money should have been reported as political donations because it was meant to keep @entity5 ' image and candidacy intact			0
the defense argues the payments were from one private third party to another and should not be characterized as campaign contributions			0
@entity132 's money went into the personal accounts of @entity92 and his wife and was used to help cover @entity47 's living and medical expenses			0
@entity26 paid for private flights and luxury accommodations as the @entity240 and @entity47 spent months on the run to keep the media from finding out about @entity5 ' affair .			1

former campaign spokeswoman for @entity3 also testified about how @entity5 angrily confronted @entity26 over financially supporting @entity30
@entity11 grew close to @entity5 and eventually distanced herself from @entity5 as the *scandal* *erupted*
*prosecution* expected to rest *tomorrow*
still *unclear* whether @entity47 will take the stand
