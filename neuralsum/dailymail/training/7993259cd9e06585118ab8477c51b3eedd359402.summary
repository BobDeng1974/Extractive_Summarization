by @entity0 last updated at 3:32 pm on 18th november 2011 anti-capitalist protesters took over an empty office building owned by investment bank @entity3 last night			1
it is the latest defiance from @entity6 protesters who announced yesterday they would legally challenge 24 hour eviction legal notices pinned to their tents outside @entity9			1
a group of around 30 protesters got into the three storey office block in the heart of @entity15 's financial district with @entity6 taking responsibility on its website today			1
occupy @entity3 : protestors today in the three - storey office block in @entity15 , they say taking over the building is part of ' public repossession ' the anti capitalist movement said it took over the abandoned office block in the neighborhood of @entity28 in a ' public repossession ' overnight			1
yesterday evening members of the group , stood in the windows looking down on @entity33 , the @entity34 , which is opposite another @entity3 building			1
one , with his face covered , tied himself to a window frame with rope and sat on the ledge			2
when asked how they got in , one of the protesters replied : ' @entity43			2
' armed police and a police helicopter were at the scene of the occupation , which is close to a similar occupation in @entity49			2
members of the group held a press conference on the ground floor with the press where they said they pledged they would be there round the clock			1
take over : an @entity6 protestor , clad in hard hard , can be seen sitting on the window ledge today ' welcome room ' : a man plays a ukulele and a lady holds a child inside the @entity3 building , protesters took over the three - storey office block yesterday evening they sat cross legged on the floor in front of a huge banner which read ' @entity6 '			1
speaking about why they were occupying the disused building , one demonstrator , who wished to be named as @entity74 , 36 , said : ' @entity3 did gamble with pensioner 's money and they lost a lot of money so there are some real issues that are global in terms of the economy			1
' and it 's the pensioners that are going to be hit the hardest			2
' the group said they were due to hold the first national conference of the @entity88 on saturday from the site in @entity33 and promised more people would be joining them			2
they told reporters they planned to use the space as a ' @entity95 ' to hold workshops and political discussions			2
near and far : banners put up by the protestors and , right , preparing this morning asked whether they were worried about eviction @entity101 , 41 , part of the @entity104 , said : ' we are not particularly worried			1
' we are occupying the space at the moment and before the police come there would have to be a court case			2
' we 're here on behalf of the pensioners who lost money			2
we hope to talk to @entity3 and the police			2
we 're very happy to negotiate and hope sense can be seen			0
' speaking about why they were occupying the disused building , a demonstrator who wished not to be named , said : ' when the @entity3 security guards were yelling at us we said we would give it back if they gave back the billion dollars the stole from pensioners			1
he added : ' we 've got more people joining us from the rest of the @entity125 and @entity126 tomorrow			0
' inside : demonstrators from the @entity88 give a news conference inside the building today you 've been served : a bailiff pins an eviction notice to a tent outside @entity9 time to leave : bailiffs acting for the @entity135 handed out eviction notices to the tents at the @entity34 site the @entity135 had told the protesters to move tents and equipment from the public highway by 6pm last night or face @entity144 action			1
but instead of packing up , protesters were discussing putting up @entity147 decorations as they prepare for a lengthy legal battle			0
bailiffs had tied notes to some of the 200 tents pitched in the churchyard telling activists to leave or face @entity144 action			1
but protesters vowed to continue and a sign on one of the tents yesterday declared : ‘ @entity159 , no – we wo n’t go ! ’ the notice was issued a day after @entity162 police cleared the @entity164 camp in @entity165			1
but lawyers warn the situation is more complex here due to human rights laws and the eviction could drag on for months			0
@entity171 had halted earlier court action to hold talks with protesters			0
but policy chairman @entity175 said the negotiations went ‘ nowhere ’			0
@entity177 , for @entity6 , insisted earlier this week the eviction ‘ was not something we need to be remotely worried about ’			1
she added : ‘ it could take months			0
’ legal threat : the warning notice handed out to protesters the @entity186 told last month how thermal imaging cameras showed the camp virtually empty at night			0
even if the court action succeeds , the protest is likely be continue in the churchyard during the day as long as nobody pitches tents			0
@entity194 , head of public law at @entity196 , said the @entity197 would make evicting @entity15 protesters a far more complex affair			1
before deciding whether to give the go - ahead to the eviction , a judge would have to consider @entity203 , which covers freedom of expression , and @entity206 , freedom of assembly , he said			1
‘ any judgment would hinge on whether the interference with those rights is " proportionate "			0
deadline passed : the anti-capitalist protesters did have the option of leaving voluntarily - but not one person has gone home ‘ the protesters have in their favour that @entity9 ’s remains open and so there is not a massive amount of disruption to the normal use of the land			1
‘ @entity223 also needs to decide if is just trying to remove the camp , or to stop the protest altogether , which would be much more difficult			0
‘ it is likely that we could get a situation where , even after the removal of the tents , protests are allowed to continue outside @entity9 ’s during the day			0
’ he said there were likely to be similarities with the attempts to evict the protesters camped in @entity238 which began in may 2010 but only concluded ten months later in march this year			0
on patrol : police officers walk among protesters outside @entity9 on wednesday the anti-capitalist protest at the @entity9 is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy			1
demonstrators have been camped outside @entity9 ’s since october 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby @entity253 failed			0
the @entity135 halted earlier court action to hold talks with protest organisers aimed at finding a compromise that would allow the demonstrators to remain at the site until january if they removed some of the tents			0
after a humiliating internal row within the church which led to two high profile resignations , @entity9 decided not to join the legal action against the protesters			0
a spokeswoman for @entity9 ’s said earlier this week : ‘ we recognise the local authority ’s statutory right to proceed with the action			0
‘ we have always desired a peaceful resolution and the @entity272 will continue to hold regular meetings with representative of the protesters			0

around 30 activists took over three - storey office building yesterday evening
@entity6 said it took over the building as part of its ' public repossession '
