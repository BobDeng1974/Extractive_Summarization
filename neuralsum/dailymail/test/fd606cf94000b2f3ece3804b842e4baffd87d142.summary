a wartime scientist has revisited the secret underground factory where she helped build aircraft engines 70 years since the end of the @entity4			1
@entity5 was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , in 1943			1
she spent two years testing metal for @entity12 aircraft engines in the site 's underground laboratory , working as the only woman in her department			1
now , 70 years after leaving her position , the 91 - year - old great - grandmother has revisited the now defunct factory			1
@entity5 revisited @entity20 in @entity8 , @entity9 , where more than 700 people worked during the war ( right ) to produce aircraft engines			1
now 91 , the great grandmother tested metal for aircraft engines revisiting the site with her son , @entity26 , mrs @entity5 said it was ' strange ' to see it so quiet			1
she worked as the only woman in its laboratory between 1943 and 1945 built in 1943 , the factory became known as @entity33 for its vast network of underground paths spread over three - and - a - half miles			1
it was one of 26 ' shadow ' sites set - up to mass produce engines and parts for military aircraft and tanks that were built underground or into hillside so that production could continue if bombed			1
designed by @entity47 at the behest of the @entity49 , @entity46 employed 700 people when mrs @entity5 began working there			1
arriving every day at 8.30am , she used scientific formulas to analyse the ratio of metals in shavings given to her by ' the men '			0
spanning more than three miles , the site became known as the @entity33 for its vast network of secret passageways the entrance to one of the tunnels which are built into hillside beneath @entity63 , @entity8 another of the tunnels ' entrances in @entity63			1
while built at road level it is 300ft from the top of the hill set up by @entity47 under the instruction of the @entity49 , @entity46 was one of 26 ' underground ' factories established to allow production lines to continue if the country came under fire with more than 700 people working at the site at a time it was one of the largest underground factories during the war mrs @entity5 was sent to work there in 1943 after being called up at the age of 20			1
she had wanted to join the @entity82 beforehand a stretch of offices in the underground factory			2
their windows were high up so that staff would not be distracted by co-workers walking by the kitchen where staff would have eaten during one of the long , underground shifts			2
mrs @entity5 had no previous experience when she was called up , but said she ' just got on with the job ' mrs @entity5 said while the tunnels were built to protect production lines from bombing , by the time she began working at @entity46 the worst of the raids had already hit the country			1
right , a newspaper cutting from 1941 detailing the deaths of three men killed when one of the tunnels collapsed during ' excavating operations ' ' i 'd had no experience at the time , someone , i think my sister - in - law , just gave me a book which told me how to do it and i just got on with it , ' mrs @entity5 told @entity114			1
' the metal could come in and it would be one of the men who would drill it into shavings			2
i 'd dissolve it in acid and then put something on it that would allow me to analyse it so i could find how much nickle , chrome etc was in each part			0
' the only woman in the laboratory , mrs @entity5 had wanted to serve in the army before being called up			1
' in a way it was luck of the draw an din a way it was n't			0
i wanted to go into the forces but parents in those days told you what to do and mine said : " no , you 'll go into industry			0
" ' earning Â£ 3 a week , she was also tasked with taking photographs of the metal for developing in a dark room next door			2
while the factory 's design was so carried out to avoid raids , the worst of the bombing across @entity149 had already occurred by the time mrs @entity5 took up work , she said			2
' they started building the tunnels in 1941 , quite late in the war			0
around that time we were being badly bombed but never when i was there			0
' the site was restored in the 1980s by the @entity159 which installed two @entity161 generators tunnel 4 , one of the main passageways used during the @entity4 to shuttle workers to their stations after the war ended , mrs @entity5 trained as a teacher and spent years teaching @entity169 in @entity170			1
she met her late husband , @entity171 , after the war had ended and the pair married in 1953			0
revisiting the @entity33 with one of her sons , @entity176 , the great - grandmother said it was ' strange ' to see it so quiet			1
in 1936 , the @entity49 approached the car manufacturer rover , asking them to help with wartime production			0
by 1939 , all motoring production had ceased and the company had begun working solely on aircraft parts and engines			2
but when its @entity188 factory was blitzed , bosses cited the need for a more secure setting to allow production to continue			0
shadow factories were then created			2
built underground , safe from the shelling of @entity196 's army , workers were free to work on engines for military aircraft and tanks			1
a canteen that was reused during the @entity201 when @entity202 became a @entity204 bunker the @entity206 site was one of the largest , spanning more than three miles			2
built into @entity63 , the factory is 300ft from the top of the hill but is in fact at road level			0
it was used to produce aircraft engines specifically for four models of @entity12 aircraft ; the @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity217			1
when demand wavered at the end of the war some staff were kept on to continue working on tanks			0
production of the @entity227 continued until 1952 when parts became surplus to requirements			2
all production stopped indefinitely thee years later when the site was handed over to the @entity232			2
in 1961 the government converted half of the tunnels to become a nuclear - safe bunker known as @entity237			0
by the 1980s it had been modernised again with new blast doors fitted to meet updated requirements			0
it was decommissioned and sold to a private company in the early 1990s and remains in their ownership			0
' all my memories are of a bustling hive of activity			0
i did enjoy my time there , it was certainly an experience			0
i just got on with it			0
' the @entity33 or @entity7 was one of 26 of the same kind across the @entity149 , built into the ground or landscape			0
during the war it was used to produce engine parts for four @entity12 aircraft - @entity219 , @entity218 , @entity220 and @entity217			1
for a short while afterward the war production continued but to create parts for army tanks			0
the site is owned by a private @entity266 company , though historians are eager to turn it into a permanent museum .			0

@entity5 worked at @entity20 from 1943 - 1945
aged 20 , she analysed metal in its laboratory for @entity219 engines
now 91 , the great grandmother has revisited the site in @entity8
it was one of 26 underground factories used to produce military parts
