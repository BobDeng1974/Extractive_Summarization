she embraced him , thanked him , held his hand and forgave him			2

@entity11 looked startled at first , then smiled			1
he placed a kiss on her cheek and listened to the words of the 81 - year - old woman who , with her twin sister , was once the subject of @entity20 ’s monstrous human experiments			1

mrs @entity3 was criticised by other victims and their families for her public forgiveness			2
‘ not only criticism , ’ she said			0
‘ they called me a traitor			0
’ but she explained : ‘ as long as we understand my forgiveness that the victim has a right to be free , you can not be free from what was done to you unless you remove from your shoulder the daily burden of pain and anger and forgive the @entity71 – not because they deserve it , but because i deserve it			0
‘ when i talk to survivors , and i say why on earth does my forgiveness hurt you , they have no answers			0
i guess victims like to have more victims ; the bigger the crowd , the better			0
i do n’t understand it			0
‘ the victims , 70 years after liberation , with 300 others , they were all talking about their experience , falling apart – “ poor me … what have they done to me ? ” ‘ i do n’t forget what they have done to me			2
but i am not a poor person – i am a victorious woman who has been able to rise above the pain and forgive the @entity71			0

recovery : @entity100 and @entity3 as shown in a 1949 photo			2

’ mrs @entity3 later tweeted : ‘ i met @entity11 , introduced myself reached to shake his hand - he grabbed my arm & fainted - i screamed 4 help			1
it was a strange reaction ! ! ’ she said @entity11 bore responsibility for helping to run the wartime concentration camp – but urged him to spend his last days teaching others about the evil of @entity128			1
in a moving interview on @entity130 ’s today programme she continued : ‘ he is 93 years old			2

but he can do some good … ’ mrs @entity3 travelled more than 4,000 miles from home in @entity134 , @entity135 , to the hearing in @entity137 , @entity138			2
@entity11 was known as the ' bookkeeper of @entity10 ' because it was his responsibility to collate and ship the valuables of the doomed back to the @entity6 in @entity142 @entity20 ( 1911 - 1979 ) , the notorious @entity21 @entity138 physician , in an image taken from from @entity145 : the @entity146 , by @entity147 her family had been among hundreds of thousands deported in cattle trucks from @entity151 and @entity152 to death camps such as @entity10			1

it was at the camp that the ten - year - old @entity3 and her twin sister @entity100 were singled out by @entity20 for his grotesque genetic experiments			1
being chosen ‘ did n’t mean the person was assured a life ’ , she said			0
‘ it meant you were not immediately taken to the gas chamber			0
’ she told how she had to stay alive for the sake of her twin sister			1
she knew if she had died , it would effectively sentence her sister to death – one twin without the other would have been useless for the experiments			1
survivors from @entity10 ( pictured ) , who are plaintiffs in the case , travelled from the @entity135 , @entity184 , @entity151 and elsewhere to attend @entity11 's trial between may 16 and july 11 , 1944 , @entity11 was on duty when 450,000 @entity35 were transported there , with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival			1

mrs @entity3 described how she was injected with a ‘ deadly germ ’ that she still can not identify			2
‘ @entity20 stood by my bed and was laughing sarcastically after reading my fever charts and saying i had only two weeks to live			2
for those following two weeks i have only one single memory : crawling on the barrack floor and trying to reach a faucet ( tap ) at the other end of the barrack for some water			0
‘ as i was crawling and fading out of consciousness , i kept saying to myself , “ i must survive ”			0
’ mrs @entity3 said she asked the defendant if he knew @entity20			1

she added : ‘ i still do n’t know what was injected into my body , and i do n’t know what was injected into my twin sister ’s body , who died 20 years ago , nor into the bodies of any of the other twins			1
’ appealing for any information about the files , she said @entity100 ’s kidney failed in 1987 and although she donated one of her own , @entity100 subsequently died			0
‘ i believe in this big world we have talked so much about human rights that i should have the human right to find out what they injected into me 70 years ago			0
