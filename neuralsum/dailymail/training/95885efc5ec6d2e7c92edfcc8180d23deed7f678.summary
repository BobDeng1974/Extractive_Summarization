by @entity0 published : 20:46 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 05:08 est , 23 january 2014 attorneys representing the husband of a pregnant , brain - dead @entity5 woman being kept on life support despite his protests is carrying a fetus that is ' distinctly abnormal ' after being deprived of oxygen for an unknown period of time			1
@entity12 remains hooked up to machines in a @entity15 hospital , while her husband and the hospital are locked in a court battle about whether to retain life support			1
the case has raised questions about end - of - life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus			0
the case has gotten the attention of groups on either side of the abortion debate , as anti-abortion groups argue @entity12 's fetus deserves a chance to be born			1
tragedy : @entity36 found @entity37 on the kitchen floor in late november			1
she 'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain			2
she was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness questions : in @entity5 , state law stipulates that , in cases of pregnant women , @entity45 do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus @entity51 said his wife , a fellow paramedic , was clear with him before he found her unconscious on november 26 : if she ever fell into this kind of condition , pull life support			1
but @entity56 says it 's bound by state law that prohibits the withdrawal of treatment from a pregnant patient , although several experts interviewed by @entity0 have said the hospital is misapplying the law			2
@entity12 's attorneys , @entity66 and @entity67 , issued a statement wednesday describing the condition of the fetus , now believed to be at about 22 weeks ' gestation			1
@entity66 and @entity67 based their statement on medical records they received from the hospital			0
' according to the medical records we have been provided , the fetus is distinctly abnormal , ' the attorneys said			0
' even at this early stage , the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender can not be determined			0
' the attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem			0
normal heartbeat : doctors previously said that the baby has a normal heartbeat and had the potential to be carried to full term happier times : above , @entity51 holds their 1 - year - old son @entity95			2
his attorneys are now saying that the fetus is deformed ' quite sadly , this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus , after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time , is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body , as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish , distress and sadness , ' the attorneys said			2
spokeswomen for the hospital and the @entity112 district attorney 's office , which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit , declined to comment wednesday			0
a hearing in the case is scheduled for friday			0
@entity12 's lawsuit asks a judge to order the hospital to pull life support and return @entity12 's body to her family			1
several experts have said the @entity124 does n't apply in this case because @entity12 , having suffered brain death , is legally and medically dead — a key argument in @entity51 's lawsuit			1
@entity12 previously told the @entity0 he was n't confident about the health of the fetus			2
his wife was 14 weeks pregnant when he found her unconscious in november , possibly from a blood clot			0
a 2010 article in the journal @entity137 found 30 cases of brain - dead pregnant women over about 30 years			0
of 19 reported results , the journal found 12 in which a viable child was born and had post-birth data for two years on only six of them — all of whom developed normally , according to the journal			0
i do n't agree with this law ' : @entity36 says he ca n't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the @entity5 law , which applies to all pregnant women , even those with do not resuscitate orders ' we knew what her wishes were ' : both @entity36 and @entity12 were both paramedics			1
he found her collapsed on november 26 and initiated @entity160 , but it was no use			1
@entity36 says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they would n't want to be kept alive by machines unfortunately your browser does not support @entity169 .			0

@entity51 of @entity171 , @entity5 , found his wife @entity37 on the kitchen floor on november 26
