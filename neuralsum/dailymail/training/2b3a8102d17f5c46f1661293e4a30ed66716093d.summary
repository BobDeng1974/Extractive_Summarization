the shimmering blue surface of a giant @entity2 lake has concealed a sunken mystery for nearly 70 years , which a drought parching the southwest may soon help reveal			1
beneath the waters of man - made @entity7 lies a b - 29 bomber that went down carrying a top - secret missile defense system that may have actually caused the crash			1
the aircraft was known as the @entity14 and was the same model as the @entity17 and @entity18 planes that dropped atomic bombs on @entity20			2
a diver at the wreck of the @entity14			2
recreational divers will soon be able to explore it for themselves the bomber went down carrying a top - secret missile defense system that may have actually caused the crash with @entity7 at record low levels , the @entity28 intends to grant permits for diving the bomber it crashed in 1948 as it flew over @entity7 testing a sun - powered missile guidance system			1
for decades it lay at a depth of 300 feet in the man - made lake that was formed by the construction of the @entity41 , but the drought has lowered water levels to the point where the plane is just 110 feet down , well within the range of recreational divers			1
better - equipped divers , using a special helium - rich gas mixture , for example , have been secretly exploring the crash site since 2001 , when it was first discovered in the giant lake 's @entity7 section			1
but now it is set to become possible for any recreational diver to reach the wreck , perhaps the secrets of the sunken plan can be fully revealed			1
' it would be amazing to see it , ' @entity59 , of @entity60 in nearby @entity61 , told @entity64			0
' there 's a lot of history there			0
the site would be right up there with any shipwreck for a diver			0
' the @entity14 at the bottom of @entity7 was one of the last of its kind to be built			2
the @entity76 , which would later become the @entity77 , received it days after @entity20 surrendered , on sept 2 , 1945			0
two years later , the plane was stripped of its defensive armament and was turned over to the military 's @entity81			0
when it went down on june 21 , 1948 , the plane and its five - man crew were testing a secret ballistic - missile guidance system known as a ' sun - tracker , ' according to the blog @entity88 is boring			1
the highly - classified device , allegedly mounted in a dorsal dome atop the bomber 's fuselage , allowed a missile to get its elevation and orientation from sighting the sun. testing it required the @entity14 's crew to repeatedly ascend to 35,000 feet , then drop to just 100 feet above the lake			1
but , according to the blog , the lake 's surface reflected the sun , and may have caused captain @entity105 to lose depth perception			1
the wreck was discovered in 2001 in @entity7 's @entity7 section , accessible to better - equipped divers this field drawing shows how the @entity14 has come to rest on the bottom of the man - made lake the aircraft was the same model as the @entity17 and @entity18 planes that dropped atomic bombs on @entity20 the plane skimmed into the lake at 230 miles per hour and while the crew escaped on life rafts , the plane dropped to the murky depths			1
recreational scuba divers have been officially banned by the @entity28 from exploring the site because of the dangers associated with such depths			2
but with @entity7 at record low levels , the federal agency intends to grant permits for diving the bomber , beginning in april			0
it was not simply the danger to divers that prompted the @entity28 to protect it from mistreatment and to prevent recreational divers from going down to the wreckage site			1
the agency is also concerned that weekend warriors could damage the wreck			0
in 2002 , it sent a remote - controlled submarine down to explore the wreckage , and discovered ropes and lights from previous dives			0
a year later , technical divers sent down by the @entity150 found signs of damage and looting			0
in 2007 , the agency allowed two licensed dive operators to lead guided scuba tours of the site , but demand was limited			0
plunging water levels have made the site much more accessible , and likely much cheaper , for recreational scuba divers , although they would still have to be accompanied by approved guides			2
the @entity150 plans to offer a two - year , commercial - use permit allowing guides to take up to 100 divers per year down to the wreck			2
' we have had people express an interest over the years , ' @entity165 , a spokesman for @entity166 said to the @entity170			0
' we think this is the best option , and it provides a business opportunity			0

aircraft , known as the @entity14 , crashed into @entity7 in june 1948
was carrying an *experimental* sun - powered missile guidance system
testing it required 35,000 feet ascents followed by *descents* to just 100 feet
the sun may have reflected off the lake 's surface , causing captain @entity105 to lose depth perception and crash into the water
wreckage was 300 feet down but is now just 110 feet following drought
recreational divers have been banned from exploring it but this is likely to be lifted soon , meaning the wreckage 's secrets could be fully revealed
