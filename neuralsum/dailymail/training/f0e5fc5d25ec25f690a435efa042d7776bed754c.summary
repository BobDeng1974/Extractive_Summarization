a mother who pays £ 130 a month to drive her autistic son to school has hit out at the ' unfair system ' after @entity4 revealed her son 's transport is paid for by the taxpayer			1
@entity8 , 44 , spoke after the millionaire glamour model defended her right to have council - funded taxi rides for her 12 - year - old disabled son @entity13			1
mrs @entity8 and her husband , a telecommunications worker , receive no council support for their son @entity16 , also 12 , who attends a special school			1
she says driving 32 miles a day to and from his school has left her unable to hold down a job			2
' @entity23 ' : @entity8 , 44 , spoke after @entity4 defended her right to have council - funded lifts for her son @entity13 , 12			1
mrs @entity8 has to pay £ 130 a month in petrol to take her son @entity16 ( right ) to school she and husband @entity30 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said they were left feeling unfairly treated after hearing the revelation from @entity4 on celebrity big brother			1
@entity16 and @entity13 are the same age			1
both have severe autism , both attend special schools assigned to them by the council and both schools are outside the council area where they live			1
@entity13 also has severe disabilities alongside his autism			2
he suffers from a genetic condition which has left him blind and unable to walk long distances unaided			0
because councils examine cases individually without looking at income , there are differences from one area or one case to the next			2
that means miss @entity4 has received support from her local council , thought to be @entity58 , but the @entity59 have not had any transport paid for by @entity61			2
mrs @entity8 said : ' i do n't blame @entity4 at all			1
she is taking what has been offered to her , despite the fact she probably does n't need it			0
mother and son : @entity4 defended her right to have taxpayer - funded taxi rides for @entity13 ( left with her at a film screening in february last year ) ' i just feel that everyone should be put into the same boat , no matter who they are			1
it 's something that really needs highlighting			0
' the system seems so unfair			0
it costs us approximately £ 130 a month in fuel , which we can barely afford			1
' i have to go on the @entity81 where there can be a lot of traffic			0
it can take between 25 minutes to an hour and a half , and i have to make that journey twice a day			0
' i know of at least three other families whose special needs children are educated out of borough and are provided with either transport or given a fuel allowance , so why are we treated differently ? ' mrs @entity8 , who gave up her job as an operations manager when @entity16 was two , described her son as ' much like a toddler ' who struggles to understand his surroundings and personal safety			1
' he gets into everything , ' she said			0
' he will go to a hot stove when it 's on			0
he 's got no concept of road awareness whatsoever			0
' he would run across a road if he saw something on the other side			0
' mrs @entity8 and her husband have another son , ten - year - old @entity108			1
she said her husband , a former telecommunications firm supervisor , was unemployed for four months last year after being ' unfairly dismissed ' , a claim he plans to fight in a tribunal			0
that left the parents almost penniless while they tried to keep paying for fuel			0
although mr @entity116 , 47 , is now working for another telecommunications firm , he is earning £ 6,000 a year less and the family struggles to make ends meet			2
' we were unable to claim benefits during this time and so ended up having to spend most of our life savings , ' mrs @entity8 said			1
' he has a new job , but is on a lower wage and i ca n't work as i need to do the school runs			0
' @entity16 joined his current school , @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity32 , after his mother removed him from @entity31 's @entity132 in 2012 because he was unhappy and losing weight			1
she also said several parents had concerns about the way pupils were treated at the school			0
the old school was just a mile from his home , and the new school is eight miles away			2
she said she had to home - school him for more than a year while she waited for @entity61 to arrange his new placement			2
after the place was confirmed , the family said they made two requests for help - and both were refused , despite their situation becoming far more desperate			0
mrs @entity8 's husband not only lost his job but was also diagnosed with skin cancer , and her father had a stroke			1
school : @entity16 ' new school , the @entity159 eight miles away , is designed for autistic pupils mrs @entity8 added : ' when we applied for transport after he had started , we were given an outright " no "			1
' i told the @entity165 about the amount of pressure i was going through but they made no effort to help us in any way , making the process as difficult as possible			0
' the second time they 've just seen that they 've declined us before and not even bothered to look into our circumstances again			0
' @entity174 , @entity61 's interim director of children and families , said : ' the council ’s view was that @entity16 's special educational needs could be met in the borough			1
' it was considered to be parental choice that @entity16 attended @entity183 , and therefore as part of the agreement with parents the council would name @entity188 on the condition that parents meet the transport costs and the parents agreed to this			2
' @entity4 passionately defended her right to bill the taxpayer for @entity13 's transport after revealing the situation on celebrity big brother			1
a spokesman for @entity200 said in a statement : ' where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the @entity208 ' duty to provide transport that meets the child 's needs			2
' this is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them			0
' debate : @entity4 made the comments about her son 's transport in the @entity221 house while talking to @entity222 ( right )			1
miss @entity4 said councils have a duty to provide transport for disabled pupils miss @entity4 said paying for her private driver , a private nurse and fuel for the one and a half hour round trip to @entity13 's @entity232 school would cost £ 1,000 a day			1
' the cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child , ' she added			0
' local authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough			2
' if @entity13 's school was on his doorstep as with schools for healthy children , then this would not apply , but it was the government 's choice to close the special needs schools			1
' councils must to provide transport to any pupil who is deemed to need it as part of their statement of @entity259			0
this transport can range from paid - for taxis and minibuses to bus and train passes , fuel allowances and ' independent travel training '			0
many councils have been trying to cut down on the number of taxis they use in order to save money			0
@entity273 , believed to be the responsible for the area where @entity4 lives , guarantees free transport with no means - testing for all children with special educational needs who can not attend a school within three miles of their home			1
the council says that the use of taxis rather than bus , car or train is allowed ' in exceptional circumstances only , usually for children with severe disabilities ' .			2

@entity8 and @entity116 send autistic son @entity16 , 12 , to a special school
they have to pay £ 130 a month petrol for 16 - mile round trip twice a day
but @entity4 's son @entity13 , also 12 , has travel funded by council chiefs
children are same age , severely autistic and attend schools far from home
yet cases are assessed individually and do not take *wealth* into account
' the system seems so unfair , ' said mrs @entity8 . ' we can barely afford it '
@entity13 also has several disabilities *including* blindness and @entity319
