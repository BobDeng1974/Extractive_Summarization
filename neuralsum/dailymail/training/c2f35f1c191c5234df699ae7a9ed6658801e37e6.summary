by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 13 march 2013 stargazers in the northern hemisphere have finally had their first chance to view the first of two comets set to blaze through our skies in 2013			1
@entity8 / 2011 @entity9 , already visible for weeks from the @entity10 , appeared to observers above the equator for the first time this week			1
incredible pictures showed the comet blazing a trial above @entity17 and @entity18 last night , as it continued its long trek north as seen from @entity20			1
cosmic flyby : the comet @entity22 is seen in the evening sky off the western coast of @entity17 , in @entity25 , last night			1
the comet will be visible until the end of march @entity9 is seen next to the waxing crescent moon : already visible for weeks from the @entity10 , it appeared to observers above the equator for the first time this week the first good viewing night for northerners was last night , when @entity9 appeared next to the crescent moon at dusk in the south - western sky			1
prior to that , glare from the @entity38 had obscured the comet			1
@entity9 is on a 106,000 - year orbit with a high inclination of 84.2 degrees with respect to the ecliptic , @entity41 reports			0
that means it is moving more or less parallel to the ' 0 hour ' line in @entity49 - the same spot that will be occupied by the @entity38 at next week 's @entity51 - and is gaining elevation only slowly as nights pass			0
bright lights : @entity9 , the bright dot in the top - right , passes over the @entity56 along with a waxing crescent moon over the @entity59 range last in @entity18 , @entity60 at the moment @entity9 is only visible in the @entity61 and @entity62 using binoculars or a telescope , but astronomers expect the first naked - eye sightings in the next few evenings			1
@entity17 astronomer dr @entity68 said the comet 's proximity to the moon will make it easier for novice sky watchers to find it			1
‘ wait until the sun is fully below the horizon to scan for the comet in the darkening twilight , ’ dr @entity68 advised			1
omen ? @entity22 , left , is visible next to a crescent moon in the western sky after sunset over @entity84 , @entity85 @entity9 ' name is an acronym for the @entity89 telescope used to spot it two years ago - the @entity90			1
the volcano - top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way			0
- and in recent months there have been several			0
like other comets of its type , @entity9 is thought to have originated in the @entity100 , a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two light years from the @entity38 the apparent path of @entity9 over the course of march : the comet will appear to move through @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
from the @entity110 it will be in the western and north - western evening sky @entity9 travelled in towards the inner solar system for millions of years , dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and ices			1
when comets approach the @entity38 , these ices heat up , eventually turning to gases that jet out into space together with dusty material to form a head or coma around the cometary nucleus			0
a comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on @entity130 , astronomers say			2
according to current calculations , comet @entity132 ( @entity131 ) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the @entity130			2
but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits , which can change as jet - like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the @entity38 , means it could pass further away , or veer into a direct collision course			2
respected astronomer @entity147 , author of @entity150 's @entity149 blog , has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with @entity130 would cause a one billion megaton explosion			2
that , he says , is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on @entity20			0
particles from the @entity38 ( the so - called solar wind ) blow the gases back in a straight tail , whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles to create a curved tail			0
to find it in @entity110 skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , according to the @entity173			1
' after sunset the comet will be low down in the west and appear as a misty patch not far from the @entity179 , ' an @entity173 spokesman said			2
' using binoculars will make it easier to find and will certainly help identify the tails which should point up from the horizon			2
' as the days pass , the comet will move away from the @entity38 and fade and light from the @entity185 will interfere more			2
' at the same time however , @entity22 will be higher up , will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky			1
' after its brief period of visibility , the comet will travel back out towards the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large telescopes			0
' an animation of comet 2011 @entity9 entering the view of @entity200 satellite @entity198 ’s @entity197 camera an image of @entity9 made by an @entity203 astronomer : the curved dust tail can be seen sweeping up from the coma on the left hand side of the image , while the straight gas tail runs upwards from left to right @entity9 is only the first comet expected to light up our skies in the next year and a half			0
@entity213 may come close to outshining the moon in november			0
it was discovered last september by @entity216 astronomers and got its acronym name from the @entity218			0
scientists have also identified a comet that is hurtling into our solar system from deep in space , and which could next year hit @entity130 with potentially catastrophic force			0
according to current calculations , comet @entity132 ( @entity131 ) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the @entity130			0
but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits , which can change as jet - like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the @entity38 , means it could pass further away , or veer into a direct collision course .			0

observers below the equator have been able to see the comet for weeks
last night was the first good viewing night for northern stargazers
@entity110 observers need a clear sky , away from city lights and a good western horizon
