by @entity1 reporter published : 05:13 est , 20 may 2012 updated : 01:37 est , 21 may 2012 unlikely supporter : atheistic scientist @entity3 is backing a @entity5 scheme that is supplying state schools with @entity7 he is the arch - atheist whose best - selling book @entity9 argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society			1
so it may come as some surprise to learn that @entity3 has thrown his full support into a scheme to send free @entity17 to every state school			2
the plan , backed by @entity21 leaders , was announced by education secretary @entity22 earlier this year in the hope children will learn about the religious text 's impact ' on our history , language , literature and democracy '			0
the @entity31 were , unsurprisingly , outraged , saying the Â£ 375,000 proposal was a waste of money and favoured @entity35 when many schools needed to accommodate several faiths			2
@entity3 , you might think , would be among the critics			0
but he said he was ' a little shocked ' that every school did not already have a copy and that he would have contributed financially to the scheme if he had been approached			1
writing in @entity43 , he says it contains a wealth of literary merit and refers back to a section in @entity9 in which he lists 129 biblical phrases which any educated speaker would recognise			0
the bible delusion ? mr @entity3 hopes the scheme will open children 's eyes to what he perceives to be moral corruption in the religious text ( file picture ) ' a native speaker of @entity59 who has never read a word of the @entity61 is verging on the barbarian , ' he adds			1
however , he admits to having an ulterior motive in backing the scheme as he hopes it will actually put pupils off religion			1
he highlights how long wars have been fought over how to interpret words ' allegedly uttered ' at the @entity69 and how centuries - long schisms were based on ' nothing more serious ' than whether @entity72 is both @entity73 and his son or just his son			0
bad influence ? @entity78 's @entity77 , an event which , mr @entity3 claims , has triggered long wars due to arguments over the interpretation of words ' allegedly uttered ' during the meal he also describes the @entity84 as horrors ' and pointed out how some fundamental protestants still take them literally			0
he said : ' people who do not know the bible well have been gulled into thinking it is a good guide to morality			0
' whatever else the @entity61 might be - and it really is a great work of literature - it is not a moral book and young people need to learn that important fact because they are frequently told the opposite			1

@entity99 ' shocked ' all schools did *n't* already have one
but admits he hopes scheme will put pupils off religion
' whatever else @entity61 might be , it is not a moral book '
