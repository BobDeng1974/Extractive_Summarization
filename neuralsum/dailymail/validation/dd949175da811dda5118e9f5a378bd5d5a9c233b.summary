it was a case of @entity1 winning his battle with @entity3 but @entity4 emerging victors in the war with @entity7 after @entity8 at the @entity9 on sunday in @entity10			1
goals from @entity12 and @entity13 gave @entity4 a 2 - 1 win to move four points ahead of @entity7 atop @entity16 with 10 games remaining but it was only @entity1 who got his name on the scoresheet , after a quieter display by @entity3 's imperious standards			1
@entity3 appeared relaxed in the tunnel , dabbling in conversation with his @entity4 team - mates , his fleece zipped up to his chin			2
@entity1 stood poised , staring forward			0
the @entity9 was an inferno , shrouded in gold , purple and blue with the 99,000 supporters in fearsome voice as the two superpowers of global football marched out on the pitch			0
@entity1 got on the scoresheet but it was @entity3 who was happiest after @entity8 @entity3 ( left ) provided the assist for @entity4 's first goal in @entity8 from @entity12 @entity12 ( right ) headed in to give @entity4 the lead after only 19 minutes against @entity7 @entity3 ( second right ) celebrates assisting @entity4 taking the lead against @entity7 @entity1 ( left ) poked @entity7 level after 31 minutes , completing a tremendous move @entity1 ( second left ) watches on as he brings @entity7 level against arch rivals @entity4 @entity1 's first touch of the ball after 40 seconds was met with searing jeers by the @entity4 fans			1
he was eventually crowded out by @entity54 and @entity55 and the dispossession of @entity7 's talisman was met with emphatic cheers			2
@entity3 's start was subdued , the diminutive @entity61 international lingering quietly in the centre of the pitch , exchanging the occasional pass with @entity65 in the first five minutes			2
but he snapped into life in the sixth minute with a nutmeg on @entity7 playmaker @entity68			0
six minutes later , the first clear chance of the game fell to @entity1 , who escaped his defender on the back post but could only turn @entity74 's deft lob onto the crossbar with @entity76 beaten			2
he should have scored and @entity4 were off the hook			0
@entity3 was still awaiting his first opportunity to get at @entity7 's defence			1
@entity80 aside , his first 15 was perhaps best summed up by @entity65 uncharacteristically hitting a looping pass over his team - mate , who had found space out on the right touchline			0
but two minutes later , @entity3 had the ball at his feet and he surged inside , picked out @entity87 and burst into the area , where he met the cross with his head but sent it wide			0
@entity4 's breakthrough came on 19 , and @entity3 had the assist			1
@entity13 was fouled on the left , @entity3 whipped a glorious ball into the area and @entity12 flicked it past @entity96 to give @entity98 's side the lead			1
it was @entity3 's 15th assist of the season and @entity1 's miss after 12 minutes already appeared costly			1
the goal galvanised @entity4 and @entity13 drew a foul from @entity105 two minutes after the opener and @entity3 seized the ball again			1
this time he was central and 25 yards out but his effort was deflected out for a corner which came to nothing			0
@entity87 missed a glorious chance for 2 - 0 on the half hour mark , meeting a ball across goal from @entity13 six yards out , only to guide his effort safely into the hands of @entity96 with the goal gaping			2
@entity1 and @entity3 walked out to a formidable atmosphere at the @entity9 for @entity8 @entity1 's goal came moments after @entity87 ( right ) has missed a great chance from close range @entity1 ( right ) wheels away to celebrate after scoring for @entity7 against @entity4 @entity1 ( right ) celebrates bringing @entity7 level against @entity4 in the @entity16 clash @entity1 hit the crossbar from close range with the scores goalless at the @entity9 it was a shocking miss and 30 seconds later , @entity7 were level			1
@entity1 led the surge forward and as @entity74 collected possession on the right of the penalty area , the @entity131 international continued his run through the centre			0
@entity74 sensed his presence and picked out his run with a glorious swish of his heel			0
@entity1 hit fifth gear to beat @entity76 to the ball , poking it under the goalkeeper to haul @entity7 level as the jeers spewed out at the @entity9			1
eight minutes before half time , @entity1 picked up the ball on the left and skipped past @entity54 but with @entity148 and @entity149 closing him down , @entity1 went tumbling			0
television replays showed that @entity149 momentarily left his boot dangling , perhaps to entice a @entity1 fall but the referee 's decision to book the @entity7 man was correct			1
in the 40th minute , @entity1 thought he had assisted a goal from @entity157 , who poked @entity1 's header into the back of the net			1
@entity157 was definitely onside but @entity1 was not and the goal was rightly ruled out			2
but the @entity7 man was finishing the first half in scintillating form			0
a ferocious shot from 30 yards out was tipped over by @entity76 and @entity157 skewed a shot wide from the corner			0
as the second half began , it seemed @entity3 was in the shadow of @entity1			2
@entity7 undoubtedly ended the first period of play in the ascendency			0
@entity3 ( left ) of @entity4 closes down @entity7 defender @entity105 in the first half at the @entity9 @entity1 ( right ) was booked for diving in the first half of @entity8 @entity1 was jeered by @entity4 's supporters every time he had possession for @entity7 @entity1 ( third right ) had strayed offside before flicking the ball to @entity157 to score and it was @entity1 who was involved in the first incident of the second phase , returning the ball into @entity74 in a probing attacking move , before @entity76 dived to his left to beat out the @entity188 striker 's clever shot across goal			1
@entity3 was drifting deep to find the ball , and @entity148 picked out his compatriot on the halfway line on 52 minutes			0
he turned and sprinted at the heart of @entity7 's back line and @entity195 reached for the ball with his leg but only managed to clip @entity3 's heels			1
the free kick failed to worry @entity7 like @entity3 's sprint forward did			1
four minutes later , @entity4 went ahead with a tremendous finish from @entity13			1
the @entity203 striker was found by a forensic pass by @entity54 , who spotted @entity13 had escaped the attention of @entity105 and had curved his run to stay on side			0
the ball was floated over , @entity13 caressed it under control with the outside of his boot and threaded it across @entity96 and into the far corner			0
@entity1 might have been worried after a clash with @entity148 on the hour mark			0
he was flattened by the midfielder but appeared to retaliate , with @entity148 exaggerating the contact made by the @entity7 attacker			0
@entity3 ( centre ) attempts to evade the challenge of @entity220 , @entity1 and @entity68 @entity1 enjoyed a formidable first half for @entity7 but was quieter in the second @entity1 ( second right ) tries to block a clearance from @entity149 of @entity4 but the referee was not fooled , only booking the @entity4 man for the initial foul			1
tempers began to fray after the clash between the pair and it suited @entity3 's @entity4 side more as the clock ticked on			1
as 73 minutes passed , @entity3 went inches away from extending @entity4 's lead			1
again out on the right , he ran inside and sprinted ominously through the centre before unleashing a fine strike from the edge of the area that went the wrong wide of the post with @entity96 beaten			0
@entity4 manager @entity98 thought the shot was in and a minute later , he must have been certain his team were about to add to their advantage			0
@entity3 was again the engineer , perhaps buoyed by his attempt seconds earlier			0
with @entity13 to his left and @entity87 to his right , @entity3 played in the @entity250 international , who blazed wide on an unusually wasteful night from the former @entity252 man			2
the pair combined again on 77 , this time @entity3 shooting at goal but his low , right - footed strike was blocked and @entity7 cleared			1
@entity74 almost punished @entity4 and @entity3 for spurning their chances when his shot from 25 yards deflected wickedly off @entity148 , but @entity76 managed to turn the ball away brilliantly			2
@entity3 ( left ) celebrates @entity13 's goal as @entity4 moved ahead in the second half @entity3 curled an effort from range inches wide in the 73rd minute for @entity4 @entity3 was creating again four minutes from full time , unlocking @entity7 's defence with a neat pass into @entity265 , who was denied by @entity96			1
@entity4 were pouring forward looked to extend their advantage			0
they did not manage to do so , but @entity3 's side held on			2
he might not have settled his duel with @entity1 , but it is advantage @entity4 in the race for the @entity16 title .			2

@entity3 assisted @entity4 's opening goal from @entity12
@entity1 finished a superb @entity7 move to level on 31
@entity13 won it for @entity4 with a tremendous finish on *56*
