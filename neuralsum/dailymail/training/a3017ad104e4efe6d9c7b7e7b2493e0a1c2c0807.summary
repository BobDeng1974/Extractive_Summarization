by @entity0 even the @entity1 could be banned , if used in the context of the atrocities committed in @entity4 @entity5 has passed the first step on the road to more severe banning of the use of @entity11 symbols and offensive ideology			1
the ban would stop the use of all @entity11 symbols and expressing remorse for the fall of the @entity11 regime , and would make calling someone a @entity11 illegal , with a punishment of up to six months in prison and a fine of 100,000 shekels ( around £ 20,000 )			1
in addition , the law would ban the use of the @entity26 symbol when used in the context of the internment camps or in reference to the holocaust			2
the bill has passed its first reading , but still has two more readings before it can become a law			1
the first reading of the bill , submitted by @entity36 passed largely unopposed , receiving 44 votes for and 17 mks voting against			2
the bill was approved on sunday by the @entity39 , meaning that it stands a better chance of becoming a law because it has the backing of the coalition government			2
an effort to pass a similar bill happened a few years before , but was voted down because many believed the existing laws were tough enough , and worried that newer , tougher laws might affect free speech			1
general attorney @entity50 , who had reservations about the possible ban the bill says the word ' @entity11 ' would be banned for anything other than ' for the purpose of learning , documentation , scientific study or historical accounts			1
' also , using words that sound like ' @entity11 ' to indirectly refer to someone as an insult would also incur punishment			0
the bill reads : ' insulting someone by expressing the wish , hope , or anticipation for the fulfillment of the @entity70 ’ aims , or expressing sorrow or protest that they were not accomplished is forbidden			0
' ' unfortunately , the phenomenon of using @entity11 symbols and epithets has grown in recent years			1
the intolerable ease with which the day - to - day usage of these concepts as part of public and political discourse , and with blatant disregard for the feelings of @entity83 survivors and their descendants , is reprehensible			0
' it received objections from attorney general @entity89 , saying that it might raise constitutional problems			0
he said : ' not all behavior that offends the public deserves to be made a crime			0
' is it proper in a democratic country to ban an entire world of images from the public discourse to protect people ’s feelings ? ' ' given the centrality and importance of the constitutional right to freedom of expression , any restriction on it must be examined meticulously and with exceptional caution			0

calling someone a a @entity11 could lead to jail *sentence* and £ 20,000 fine
use of @entity1 in context of @entity83 would be banned
@entity117 has reached first reading , still has two more readings to become law
attempts on similar bill were shot down years *ago* on free speech grounds
