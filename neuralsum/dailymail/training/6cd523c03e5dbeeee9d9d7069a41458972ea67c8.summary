a former @entity1 contestant forced to crowdsource funds so she can have life - saving brain surgery says it is staying in her small home town , and not moving to @entity6 , that is saving her life			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , was a top 20 finalist on the fifth season of @entity1 , and while public support could n't get her to the final 12 of the popular reality show , the small town support she is getting now is saving her life , as she has already raised the $ 30,000 initial payment for her surgery			1
and it 's not just money that is helping the married mother of three get by these days			0
' with a small town , someone is always there to give you a hug , tell you they ’re praying for you , as well as cook you a meal if needed			2
big cities may offer more to do , but my small town has literally been a life saver			1
' miss @entity9 revealed that back in her @entity1 days , host @entity52 urged her to move to @entity6 to pursue her music career , something she is now grateful she never followed through on , preferring to go back to her small town because ' the sense of community is so much greater			1
' she was diagnosed with having a pineal gland tumor in the center of her brain in 2010 , which doctors initially said could only be removed by way of a dangerous craniotomy			0
even with this surgery however , there was still a chance she could end up with brain damage or even dead			2
miss @entity9 has since found another doctor who will perform a less invasive surgery , which is good news for the mom whose three children , @entity72 , 5 , @entity73 , 2 , and 1 - year - old @entity74 , are the biggest reason she keeps fighting			1
“ one of the most difficult thoughts that i have to battle is the thought of my three precious babies growing up without their mommy here , ” she said			0
famous friends : miss @entity9 ( above with @entity52 ) got some support from fellow @entity1 alums @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 , who all publicized her cause after reaching her first goal two days ago , no doubt thanks to some support from a few of her big name @entity1 pals like @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 , who all publicized her efforts to raise money , miss @entity9 thanked everyone on her @entity100 page			1
' this is a huge thank you to family , friends , anonymous donors , and to total strangers who felt it in your heart to give ; you are all amazing and my heart continues to cry thank you ! ! ! ! ' she wrote			0
her ultimate goal is to raise $ 100,000			0
miss @entity9 also says she is getting some major support from her husband , @entity25			2
' @entity115 has blessed me with a wonderful husband , @entity25 , and he has been such a pillar of strength for me when i ’ve needed it most , and we ’ve birthed three beautiful children that have literally given me a reason to live , ' she said			0
