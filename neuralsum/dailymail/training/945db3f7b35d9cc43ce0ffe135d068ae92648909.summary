when @entity1 sings the @entity2 at @entity3 before @entity4 play @entity5 on sunday afternoon , it will be the realisation of a dream formed in the gym of a @entity9 youth club , where she played against boys four years older			1
‘ the fact there ’ll be 55,000 people singing it back at me makes you realise how far you ’ve come as an individual but also as women footballers , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ it was always our aim to raise the profile of the game and i believe it ’s only going to get bigger			1
’ this is the first time an @entity4 women ’s game will be played at the new @entity3			1
demand for tickets for the friendly far outstripped that for the men ’s friendly against @entity29 in september and there might have been an even bigger crowd were it not for engineering works on @entity34 ’s transport system putting a cap on ticket sales			1
@entity1 ( far right ) celebrates scoring her first goal of the @entity39 qualifier against @entity40 in september @entity1 poses during a fashion photoshoot at @entity42 ‘ we sold out for our capacity , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ who knows , in the future if we get invited back to @entity3 again it could be a bit higher			2
‘ i ’ve been to @entity3 before to watch @entity9 and @entity49 in the @entity50 semi-final in 2012			2
i saw the atmosphere there and i did n’t ever think women ’s football would be played in front of those crowds in my time			2
’ @entity1 ’s love of the game began on the playing fields of her primary school and at her local youth club where she watched her older brothers play and had a kickabout on the sidelines			1
‘ i played with lads four years older than me , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ it brought me on physically and mentally and challenged me a lot more than when i played with the girls because there were n’t that many girl footballers about			0
‘ when i was 12 i was told i could n’t play with the boys any more and i was devastated			0
i ’d recommend for any little girl starting out to play with the boys as long as possible			0
’ @entity1 tackles @entity74 's @entity73 during an international friendly in august ‘ a lot of the boys i played with went on to play non-league and they come and watch me sometimes			1
‘ i remember as a kid scouts from @entity9 and @entity49 would come along and i ’d try to impress them and they ’d look at me like , “ you ’re not a boy ”			0
but even at @entity83 now if someone comes along to watch us train i ’ll be putting in the extra 20 per cent to make sure they know women ’s football is a good standard			2
that ’s the fight we ’ve been fighting all our lives			0
that ’s why the @entity3 game is so big — we ’re finally winning the battle			1
’ @entity1 , 23 , joined @entity49 as a teenager but last year she was lured to @entity83 , another @entity95 side who are at the vanguard of developing women ’s football at elite level			1
‘ if i want to be at the top @entity83 is the best club for me , ’ said @entity1 , ‘ the women are treated exactly the same as the men , they ’ve built a mini stadium just for the women ’s team			1
we train with the under 18 boys			0
@entity1 plays for @entity108 , and says it is the best club to be at to fulfil her ambitions @entity1 ( centre ) in action for @entity83 as she holds off a challenge from @entity115 's @entity114 ‘ that takes me back to my childhood , i get a kick out of that			1
i see the likes of @entity121 , @entity122 or @entity123 around the building and they will say they ’ve watched our games sometimes			0
’ anyone who has seen @entity1 ’s sweetly struck volleyed goal against @entity130 which was judged @entity50 goal of the month can not deny the skill level of women ’s football			1
@entity1 , who is fond of a pair of fake eyelashes and manicured nails , says people should not be deceived by her appearance			2
‘ being feminine and sporty is not mutually exclusive , ’ she said			0
‘ that ’s just the way i am and i ’m not going to change that because i ’m a footballer			0
‘ i ’m a totally different person when i go on the pitch			0
you can judge me and say i like to look after my nails or i want to wear false eyelashes but it does n’t mean i ’m going to pull out of a 50 - 50 challenge			0
i think it ’s good that there are a couple of girls on the team who are a lot more feminine and it ’s important that girls have different role models			0
the 23 - year - old forward has represented her country 16 times and scored 12 goals ‘ it ’s important that people are judged on their footballing ability first and foremost			0
it does n’t mean to say because someone else is n’t as feminine they ’re not as good			0
’ @entity1 knows there will be no scope for worrying about chipped nail varnish against @entity5			1
the visitors have won seven out of the last eight @entity171 , as well as two of the last three @entity173 and will provide a stern assessment of @entity176 ’s side			0
@entity5 cruised through the qualifying campaign for the @entity39 with 10 wins , including a 10 - 0 thrashing of @entity180			2
‘ i would n’t want any other opposition for this big stage , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ if we want to be at the top of our game , we need to be playing in front of 55,000 against one of the best teams in the world and people can see how good we are			2
