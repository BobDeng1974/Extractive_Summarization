capt @entity9 risked her life to coolly defuse one ied before retreating to a safe distance			2
she returned to the alleyway to take photographs of the device when a second booby - trap partially detonated , resulting in no injuries			2
instead of cancelling the mission , capt @entity9 made a joke and nervelessly re-entered the narrow alleyway to neutralise the device			1
her comrade , corporal @entity95 , told @entity96 : ‘ she had a few cigarettes and made light of the situation			0
‘ i asked captain @entity9 over and over again if she was happy to continue and being a stubborn @entity103 woman as she was , she was quite happy to continue			1
’ tragically , a third bomb exploded , inflicting terrible injuries			0

on arrival we realised she was a quadruple amputee and time was limited			0
‘ she could not speak but her eyes were open and she was responsive			0

i commend you on that			0
’ colonel @entity145 , an @entity147 bomb disposal expert who investigated capt @entity9 ’s death , said the first @entity19 had a high metal content and was placed as a ‘ come on ’ for coalition soldiers who found it with metal detectors			2
