by @entity0 and @entity1 a group of friends soaking up the golden @entity5 sun , laughing as they fish with sticks by a campsite and showing off a shark caught in shallow waters			0
these are the stunning images which give a beautiful insight and rare context into @entity13 , the iconic 1930s photograph which best represented @entity5 's unique beach culture			2
the quintessentially @entity5 image , snapped my @entity17 , has been revealed to have come from a collection of 108 other photographic prints from a group camping trip down the @entity23 south coast			1
they were put together into an album by @entity17 's good friend , architect @entity26 , and hidden away in the dark room at his home for many years			2
the @entity13 : @entity17 took this iconic image in 1937 though it was n't published until 1975			2
there are believed to be around 200 signed prints of the photograph now on display for the first time at @entity36 of @entity23 , the ' @entity33 ' shows an array of photographs taken by @entity17 and his then partner @entity39 during camping trips to @entity41 in 1937			1
beyond the one iconic photograph , the album , donated to the @entity36 by the late mr @entity26 's son , @entity43 , presents an important record of @entity5 life in the late 30s , just after the depression			0
' every now and then it would come out at dinner parties and things like that but after my dad died i think we forgot about it for some period of time , ' @entity43 said of the album to the @entity58			0
' @entity59 used to talk a little bit about history , he was n't one that dwelled on the past a lot but there were a couple of stories that he told about those times which were , life was very simple during the depression and i think some of these simple camping trips reflected some of that - and it was always good to have such interesting good friends around			0
' fellow photographer : @entity39 's work was also featured in the @entity33 but what astonished the library 's curators , was the alternative versions of the famous @entity13 image that were found in the holiday album , one of which @entity17 preferred and had originally chosen for publication			1
the extremely rare photo , of which the negative has been long lost , looks identical to the popularised image at a moment 's glance , but actually presents the subject in a more realistic way			0
the photographs subject , @entity93 builder @entity92 , holds one hand in a fist and lies somewhat more in proportion to the sky , the surf clearly seen behind him			0
the album also reveals alternative shots of @entity102 , taken from different angles and varying views by @entity17 , despite his claims that the shot was spontaneous			1
@entity17 , who died almost 22 years ago , was known to have resented the undying fame and attention given to @entity102 , striving to give credit to his other works			0
the other @entity13 : this version of the image shows @entity17 's friend @entity113 with his right hand clasped			1
this is @entity17 's favourite version of the photograph though less famous			2
no copies of this photo exist except the one housed by the @entity36 of @entity23 and the negative has been lost beach culture : the images give a context to the photo which cemented @entity5 beach identity new angle : this is @entity113 in the same pose as in @entity13 , taken from another perspective @entity41 : the series gives an insight into what was simply a group of friends enjoying time on @entity23 ' @entity134 @entity135 : the beach is shown here at night illuminated by a bright moon the photographer photographed : @entity39 took this shot of @entity17 with all his cameras @entity17 : the series includes many portraits , including this one taken by @entity39 , who took 17 of the 108 photos in the album and again : @entity17 can be seen here enjoying a joke with the person behind the camera @entity113 : this is the same man pictured in the iconic sunbaking photograph @entity26 : this builder was the owner of the album containing all these photographs , which is now held by the @entity36 of @entity23 @entity155 : she appears in many of the photographs taken by @entity17 and @entity158 in 1937 boys will be boys : @entity158 captured this playful moment between @entity17 and @entity26 a sunburnt country : trees line the beach on the @entity23 @entity134 simpler times : this is believed to be @entity155 writing beneath the shade of a gumtree on duty : @entity39 can be seen here washing dishes with two friends telling a tale : the photographs give an insight into what life was like in the 1930s @entity177 shot : @entity17 took this candid photo of friends he was camping with @entity180 : @entity41 is shown in exquisite detail in the series of black and white photographs @entity113 and @entity184 : friends of @entity17 and @entity158 relax in the @entity5 sunshine got a big one : @entity113 holding a shark caught off the beach down under : the collection captures the essence of the @entity5 way of life time out : @entity17 ( left ) relaxing with a male and female friend summer sunshine : @entity17 and @entity197 muck around on the beach gone with the wind : a woman takes in the scenery on the @entity134 happy snap : the group can be seen here taking it in the sunshine mucking around : the photographs show the group of friends enjoying their time on the @entity5 land young love : @entity113 and @entity184 rumble in the grass gone @entity213 ' : @entity113 checks the surf at the beach triumphant : a man looks out towards the ocean on @entity41			1
