there are no longer four basic face shapes , with scientists identifying five new distinct shapes among @entity5 faces			1
dr @entity6 , a leading facial recognition scientist , analysed over 1000 faces from different states across @entity5 , unmasking five new face shapes			1
new face shapes that were discovered are kite , rectangle , teardrop , heptagon and oblong in research conducted by dr @entity6			1
before this research , more than half of @entity5 thought their face was oval , however , it has turned out that only 14 per cent actually have this shaped face			2
the most common face shape among @entity5 's is a new model , coined , ' @entity25 ' ( above )			1
a study found 20.4 per cent of @entity5 have a kite shaped face the research , commissioned by @entity30 , found that around one - third of @entity5 are unsure of their face shape , prompting the company to better understand the different shapes of individuals			1
the most common face was a new model , coined ' kite ' , which is found among 20.4 per cent of @entity5			1
the second most common shape is the heart frame , which is a more traditional pre-existing shape among @entity5			2
@entity5 super model @entity40 has a square shaped face			2
people with square shaped faces have an angular shape , where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal ' rarer types such as teardrop , heptagon and oblong , although reflecting a relatively small percentage of @entity5 of only 5 per cent each , all have very distinct features that set them apart form more common groups , ' dr @entity47 told @entity57			1
she said that the most surprising discovery was the diversity in face shapes			1
' i did not expect to find nine shapes that stood out so prominently , ' she said			0
' this was really the first study of its kind and so i was really surprised with the number of shapes			0
' dr @entity47 said that knowing your face shape is just as important as knowing your shoe size or clothing size			1
she said that this research helps optometrists to ' better understand their customers and the type of frames that would suite them best '			0
' you go shopping for shoes and dresses knowing your size , so knowing your shape face also makes you feel and look your best ' , dr @entity47 said			1
but dr @entity47 said a lot of people confuse their shape with existing models			1
' an oval shape is very similar to a kite face but it has more even features like the forehead and jawline , which is more even in terms of length and curve , ' she said			2
when asked whether there is one particular shape that is more attractive amongst others , dr @entity47 insisted that beauty was in the eye of the beholder			1
' the measurements that we used for this research is just a small part to determine someone 's attractiveness - any shape could be just as beautiful - the attractiveness is more about features and symmetry rather than the shape '			0
@entity5 actress @entity113 ( left ) has a kite shaped face , one of the most popular shapes found among @entity5			1
@entity118 , @entity119 ( right ) , has a heart shape face , the second most common shape among @entity5 but when it comes to models , dr @entity47 admits they tend to have a square shaped face			1
' they have a defined bone structure and everything is fairly in proportion '			0
only 11 per cent of @entity5 have a square shaped face , among them is super model @entity40			0
@entity131 describes their characteristics as ' an angular face shape , where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal '			2
other @entity5 celebrities were put through a face analysis which found @entity119 with a heart shaped face , @entity141 with an oval shaped face , and @entity113 with a kite shaped face			2
dr @entity47 analysed 1000 @entity5 faces using image processing and point detection software			1
' i took measurements with the points and used something called cluster analysis which grouped people in their category ' , she said			0
# 1 kite : 20 % of @entity5 characteristics : kite face shapes have prominent cheekbones , which are slightly wider than the mid and lower forehead			1
the kite face narrows at the jawline and the chin			0
# 2 heart : 20 % of @entity5 characteristics : heart faces have a longer and wider forehead , with cheekbones a similar width to the lower forehead			0
hearts have a slightly more prominent jaw than kite shapes and narrow at the chin			0
# 3 @entity175 : 16 % of @entity5 characteristics : rectangle faces are recognisable by their defined jaw line , of similar width to the cheekbone and lower forehead			2
# 4 oval : 14 % of @entity5 characteristics : ovals are typically smaller than average on all measures			0
@entity187 faces are widest at the cheekbone and narrow through the forehead and jaw			0
# 5 round : 11 % of @entity5 characteristics : round faces have soft , balanced features , typically with a shorter face length and narrower cheek and jawline			2
# 6 square : 7 % of @entity5 characteristics : an angular face shape , where the forehead and chin lengths are almost equal			1
square faces are angular with wider but equal forehead cheekbone and jaw width			0
# 7 @entity207 : 5 % of @entity5 characteristics : @entity209 is a shorter face , with a narrow forehead and cheekbone			0
this is the only group for which the forehead length is shorter than the chin			0
# 8 @entity216 : 4 % of @entity5 characteristics : @entity219 faces are typically longer than average			0
their most striking features are a wide forehead and prominent cheekbones			0
# 9 @entity225 : 2 % of @entity5 characteristics : while rare , the oblong differs from other groups being longer and wider through all measures .			0
