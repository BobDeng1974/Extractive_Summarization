by @entity0 - parkinson published : 07:16 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 09:54 est , 15 may 2012 fun - loving and mischievous : @entity2 was killed after being kicked across a room and into a door , rupturing his abdomen a ' wicked and controlling ' man who murdered his ' fun - loving , mischievous ' stepson has today been ordered to serve at least 17 years in prison			1
@entity9 , 34 , was yesterday found guilty of murdering @entity2 , five			1
@entity9 admitted he kicked and bit @entity2 on the day of his death but denied murder			1
the boy 's mother , @entity12 , 27 , has been found guilty of failing to prevent his death and is due to be sentenced next month			1
the kick was so hard that @entity2 flew two feet through the air hitting a door at his home in @entity18 , near @entity19 , rupturing his abdomen and slowly killing him			1
at @entity22 today , mr @entity21 sentenced him to life with a minimum tariff of 17 and a half years			1
he said : ' @entity2 had been left in your care while his mother took two other children to school			0
' his young life was cut tragically short			0
this has been a tragedy for his father , his mother and the rest of the family			0
@entity2 was particularly vulnerable because of his age			0
he was only half your height and a quarter of your weight			0
' i entertain the lingering suspicion you inflicted more blows than you have admitted and that may have been the reason @entity2 said nothing to his mother when she returned			1
' a report published after the conviction found that key opportunities to protect @entity2 were missed by authorities tasked with his care			1
it acknowledged that previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been ' seen in isolation ' with ' minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries '			1
@entity57 , mitigating , said @entity9 ’s attack on @entity2 on march 7 last year was not pre-meditated and was instead a loss of temper and ' act of spite '			1
@entity9 , left , was found guilty of murder while @entity2 's mother , @entity12 was found guilty of allowing his death he said : ' my client was himself the victim of considerable violence as a child			1
he lacked a real appreciation as to the consequences of what he did because , despite the treatment he himself had been the victim of , he had never suffered serious injury			0
' the trial heard evidence that @entity2 suffered a number of ' non-accidental ' injuries in the year before his death			1
but mr @entity81 said his client had been cleared of cruelty and neglect allegations and should be sentenced on the basis that this was an isolated attack			2
in june 2010 , a year before he died , @entity2 was taken to hospital with a fractured leg			2
his mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body			0
children 's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident			2
in september that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike			0
again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed it to be from a genuine accident			0
on february 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a radiator burn			0
@entity2 's mother said he was accident prone			2
he was taken to see a gp but there was no further action			0
head of children 's services at @entity120 , councillor @entity116 said : ' it was a single violent assault that led to his death and the perpetrator has now been brought to justice			1
@entity125 , executive director of @entity126 , said : ' there were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous			1
' a serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that @entity2 's death was predictable or preventable			1
mr @entity125 added : ' nonetheless the service we offered @entity2 was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing			0
' @entity2 , who lived in @entity18 but is originally from @entity138 , and @entity9 , also from @entity18 , were each cleared of two counts of cruelty or neglect relating to their failure to seek prompt medical attention on previous occasions			1
in statement read outside the court on behalf of @entity2 's family yesterday , his father @entity145 said : ' the last year of my life has been unbearable			2
@entity2 was a fun - loving mischievous little boy with a big heart and amazing smile			2
' i feel lost without him in my life and i ca n't believe he has gone			0
it hurts me that i will never get the chance to see him grow up and see the man he should have become			0
' a serious case review , compiled by the @entity157 and published after the verdict at @entity22 , acknowledged failings by the organisations responsible for his care , including @entity162			2
the report concluded that it was impossible to say that , had there been greater intervention , the tragedy would have been prevented			0
but the report said : ' whilst it would be very challenging to state with any conviction that the subject ’s ( @entity2 ’s ) death was either predictable or preventable , there were certainly numerous missed opportunities when interventions should have been more rigorous and incisive on clear occasions when there were concerns about his safety at home			1
' additionally , there were some occasions when initiatives were not taken to assess the levels of risk to the subject when there was a procedural requirement to have done so			0
' even if any of the missed assessment opportunities had in fact been taken and completed in line with procedures , it could still not be said with any certainty that they would have made a difference to the eventual tragic outcome			1
' superintendent @entity196 , from @entity197 , said : ' this was a wicked crime in which an innocent five - year - old was murdered by a person who should have been looking after him			0
@entity145 , @entity2 's father , watched in court as @entity9 was sentenced to 17 years in prison ' @entity9 is a controlling and violent man who lost his temper and inflicted fatal injuries to @entity2			1
@entity2 has been found to have allowed his death following these fatal injuries - @entity2 deserved more from his mother			2
' every child has the right to be protected and feel safe in their own home and it is a parent ’s responsibility to ensure this is the case			0
' in a statement , @entity125 , executive director of children 's services at @entity120 , said there were ' lessons to be learned ' following @entity2 's death			1
he added that these were consistent with previous @entity227 inspections which had found weaknesses in the council 's procedures to safeguard children			2
@entity116 , the council 's cabinet member for children 's services , expressed regret for the ' terrible tragedy '			2
@entity236 @entity196 described the murder as a ' wicked crime ' in which an innocent child was killed by someone who should have been looking after him she said that since last year the council had recruited an extra 25 social workers , reduced workloads and is now completing assessments of all vulnerable children in a ' timely fashion '			0
mr @entity125 said : ' there were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous			1
however , sadly , it is not clear that even if we had completed this work to the required standard , that the outcome for @entity2 would have been any different			0
' nonetheless , the service we offered @entity2 was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing			0
' we would like to reassure residents that @entity19 's children 's social care department is unrecognisable now to what it was 12 months ago and we have made significant improvements to our services to vulnerable children			2
' we appreciate that our actions since last summer can not change what has happened in the past , but we can confirm that our services are now much more effective at protecting vulnerable children			0
