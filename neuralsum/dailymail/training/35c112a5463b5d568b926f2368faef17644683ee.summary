tiny microbes hidden in the soil are one of the major amplifiers of global warming			1
but researchers are unsure whether these microbes are slaves to their environment or the cause of climate change			1
now , scientists from the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , claim to have evidence that a single species of microbe found in @entity13 may be driving global warming			1
scientists from the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , claim to have shown that a single species of microbe found in @entity13 may be driving global warming			1
the researchers installed special instruments for measuring methane changes using @entity23 chambers that trap the gases emanating from the soil the discovery could help scientists improve their simulations of climate change by including data on how microbes control the release of gases , such as methane			1
earlier this year , scientists found a single species of microbe in permafrost soils of northern @entity13 that had begun to thaw under the effect of globally rising temperatures			1
researchers suspected that the microbe played a role in global warming by releasing vast amounts of carbon stored in permafrost soil close to the @entity45 in the form of methane			1
methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for trapping heat in the @entity52 's atmosphere			1
but the actual role of this microbe - dubbed @entity54 , which roughly translates to ' methane - bloomer from the @entity55 ' - was unknown			2
the discovery in @entity13 could help scientists improve their simulations of climate change by including data on how microbes control the release of gases , such as methane the international research team installed automated chambers that measure greenhouse gases emanating from the soil as microbes metabolise nutrients previously locked up in the permafrost soil the new research pins down the role of the new microbe , finding that the amount of @entity74 , should help to predict their collective impact on future climate change			1
' if you think of the @entity80 savanna as an analogy , you could say that both lions and elephants produce carbon dioxide , but they eat different things , ' said senior author @entity86 , an associate professor at the @entity87			0
' in @entity74 , we discovered the microbial equivalent of an elephant , an organism that plays an enormously important role in what happens to the whole ecosystem			0
' climate - changing microbes , known as @entity96 ( pictured ) , may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history the worst mass extinction in @entity52 's history - long before dinosaurs roamed the planet - was caused by microbes , according to a recent study			1
the tiny organisms suddenly began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide - some 250 million years ago			2
fumes spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species , from snails and small crustaceans to early forms of lizards and amphibians in less than 20,000 years			0
the ' @entity116 ' occurred more than 252 million years ago - long before dinosaurs lived roamed @entity52 - at the end of @entity120 era			2
in the past asteroids , volcanoes and raging coal fires have been blamed but the finger is now being pointed at tiny microbes called @entity96			0
these spewed enormous amounts of methane into the atmosphere , dramatically altering the climate and the chemistry of the oceans			2
unable to adapt in time , countless species perished and vanished from the @entity52			0
alarmingly , the same effects are starting to happen today as a result of global warming caused by carbon emissions			0
the study revealed that because of these microbial activities , all wetlands are not the same when it comes to methane release			0
' this has been a major shortcoming of current climate models , ' said lead author @entity146 , at the @entity147			0
' they assume the wrong isotope ratio coming out of the wetlands , the models overestimate carbon released by biological processes and underestimate carbon released by human activities such as fossil - fuel burning			0
' to study microbes , researchers drive cores into the ground at @entity160 in northern @entity13 one of the big questions facing climate scientists , according to professor @entity86 , is how much of the carbon stored in soils is released into the atmosphere by microbial activity			1
' as the " global freezer " of permafrost is failing under the influence of warming , we need to better understand how soil microbes release carbon on a larger , ecosystem - wide level and what is going to happen with it , ' he said			2
' for years , there 's been a debate about whether microbial ecology ' matters ' to what an ecosystem collectively does , ' added @entity185 from the @entity87			0
' this work shows that microbial ecology matters to a great degree , and that we need to pay more attention to the types of microbes living in those thawing ecosystems			0
' projected temperature change from 2081 - 2100			0
one of the big questions facing climate scientists , according to professor @entity86 , is how much of the carbon stored in soils is released into the atmosphere by microbes			2

scientists found the microbe in permafrost soil of northern @entity13
the soil had begun to thaw under the effects of globally warming
microbes may have played a role in warming by releasing methane
methane gas is responsible for trapping heat in @entity52 's atmosphere
find could help scientists improve their models on climate change
