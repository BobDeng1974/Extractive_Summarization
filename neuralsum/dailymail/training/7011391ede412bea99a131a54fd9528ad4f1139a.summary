@entity0 has urged his @entity2 team - mates to put their first defeat of the season behind them to cement their place at the top of the @entity10 table			1
the @entity11 ended up on the wrong end of the scoreline for the first time in 22 games in all competitions at @entity17 on saturday as substitute @entity19 's second - half double secured a 2 - 1 victory for the @entity21			1
however , keeper @entity0 insists they must forget the disappointment of defeat at @entity25 as they prepare for wednesday night 's @entity28 clash with @entity29 before turning their attention to @entity33 's visit to @entity34 and the business of winning the title			1
@entity0 ( right ) has urged @entity2 to regroup following the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity17 @entity19 came off the bench to score twice against @entity2 on saturday @entity2 fell to their first @entity10 defeat in 15 games this season the 22 - year - old told @entity42 : ' that 's the most important , that we are still leaders and from the next game on , we will fight to keep that bonus up and make the gap bigger			1
' there are only difficult games in the @entity10 and we know that			0
the next game is in the @entity28 at home and then against @entity33 , we have to win in front of our fans			0
' @entity2 , who have now lost on their last three league visits to @entity25 , left the north east for the second time in a week wondering how they were doing so without three points after dominating for long periods just as they had done at @entity59 seven days earlier , when they emerged with a 0 - 0 draw			2
on this occasion , however , their inability to turn pressure into tangible reward was punished by their hosts , who defended manfully before striking decisively on the counter			0
the @entity2 keeper is unable to stop @entity19 's opening goal at @entity25 @entity70 looks on helpless after @entity19 scores the second goal for @entity17 the deadlock was broken with 57 minutes gone when @entity19 , who had only been on the pitch for four minutes , slid home @entity76 's cross after @entity77 could only help the ball into his path			1
@entity2 immediately launched a fightback and came desperately close to an equaliser with 12 minutes remaining when @entity83 's shot came back off the post with @entity17 's third - choice keeper @entity86 , who had replaced the injured @entity88 at the break , beaten for the first time			2
but worse was to follow as the @entity21 turned defence into attack for @entity93 to play in @entity19 for his second			2
substitute @entity95 gave the visitors hope when , after defender @entity97 had been dismissed for a second bookable offence , he glanced home an 83rd - minute @entity101 free - kick , but despite having 13 minutes , including six of stoppage time , in which to find an equaliser , they could not manage to beat debutant @entity86 again			2
@entity2 manager @entity105 remonstrates with fourth official @entity106 @entity95 rises above the @entity17 defence to give @entity2 hope in the closing stages @entity0 said : ' obviously we are disappointed with the result			1
we tried our best to win this game , and it was a hard game			0
we were a little bit unlucky			0
' at 2 - 0 , it 's harder			2
we tried to fight back , we scored to make it 2 - 1 , but then the ball would n't fall right for us and we could n't draw this game and maybe then win it , so obviously we are disappointed			1
' but we will work hard again tomorrow in training to win the following games			0
everybody worked hard and gave it all on the pitch to win this game , but we know here it is difficult and we went down against them			0
' it was a hard game , but we have to stay positive			0
we are still leaders , but we know these games to be champions you have to win , so from the next game on , we will try our best to win all the games if possible			0
' @entity0 insists the @entity2 players must forget the defeat against @entity17			1

@entity2 lost first game of the season with 2 - 1 defeat against @entity17
@entity19 scored twice to give @entity21 commanding lead
@entity95 scored late *header* to give @entity2 hope
@entity0 insists @entity11 must move on
