by @entity0 researchers from @entity2 and the @entity3 say the over- 50s would be better off avoiding insulin injections insulin injections may do more harm than good for some diabetes patients over the age of 50			1
researchers say the benefits of the treatment can be outweighed by the daily disruption and side effects that include weight gain			2
patients with type 2 diabetes should instead make simple lifestyle changes such as exercising and eating healthily			1
around 2.9million @entity20 have this form of the disease , which is triggered by obesity			1
some of these patients have to take insulin up to five times a day			2
it works by controlling the blood sugar and thereby preventing complications such as blindness , strokes and even amputations			0
but the researchers from @entity2 and the @entity3 say the over- 50s would be better off avoiding the injections and becoming more healthy			0
their study , which is published in the @entity36 , used a computer model and the findings of a @entity20 study of 5,100 patients to calculate the benefits and risks of insulin injections			1
for the over- 50s , the injections lowered the risk of suffering from kidney failure , heart disease , blindness or needing amputations by less than 0.01 per cent			0
there are no figures for exact numbers of type 2 diabetes patients using insulin but charities say it is in the order of hundreds of thousands			1
the jabs are administered between two and five times a day and a third of patients gain weight while others suffer headaches and flu - like symptoms			0
lead author @entity64 , professor of internal medicine at the @entity66 , said : ' for people with type 2 diabetes , the goal of managing blood sugar levels is to prevent associated diabetes complications , such as kidney , eye and heart disease , but it is essential to balance complication risks and treatment burdens when deciding how aggressively to treat blood sugars			1
' if you 're a patient with fairly low complication risks , but are experiencing symptoms from low blood sugar , gaining weight or find frequent insulin shots to be disruptive to your daily life , then the drugs are doing more harm than good			0
' prescribing medicine is n't just about reducing risks of complications , but also about helping patients improve their quality of life			0
' patients with type 1 diabetes – usually diagnosed in childhood – have to take insulin otherwise their blood sugar would rise to a dangerously high levels			2
their study used a computer model and the findings of a @entity20 study of 5,100 patients to calculate the benefits and risks of insulin injections and the researchers point out the injections still provide substantial benefits for younger patients with type 2 and for those who can not control their blood sugar			1
@entity115 , professor of medicine at the @entity66 , said : ' drugs that lower blood sugar levels are extremely beneficial in some patients but offer almost no benefit for others			0
' these results have major implications for the millions of people who are currently being told they need to increase medication in order to achieve their glucose goal			0
' @entity130 , director for health intelligence at the charity diabetes @entity20 , said : ' clearly , everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to have insulin to stay alive			2
' but for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , sometimes there is a balance to be struck where certain medications might help give someone a longer life but also cause side effects that might negatively impact on quality of life			1
' this study highlights the importance of looking at the individual needs of the person with type 2 diabetes , rather than adopting a blanket approach			1
' it also underlines how vital it is that healthcare professionals and people with diabetes work closely together to jointly decide what the best treatment options are for that person			0
' weighing up the potential benefits and side effects needs to be at the centre of that discussion			0
