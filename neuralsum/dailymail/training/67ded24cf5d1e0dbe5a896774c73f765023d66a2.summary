the screen icon was the first owner of the 1967 @entity10 / 4 after he took delivery while on the set of @entity13			1
@entity14 was a huge fan of the coupe , which is regarded by many as one of the ultimate @entity18 , and held on to it until 1971			1
@entity5 's @entity4 gtb / 4 after restoration back to how he owned it in the @entity22 in @entity23 the classic restored @entity4 has been transformed back to original owner @entity5 's personal spec - thanks to its @entity7 - winning owner @entity5 was the first owner of the 1967 @entity4 275 @entity27 / 4 after he took delivery while on the set of @entity13 he had the original silver car re-sprayed to red and fitted the wheels from his @entity32 , which he had previously crashed			1
but a later owner decided to spend $ 10,000 controversially having it transformed from a coupe ( @entity36 ) into a convertible ( @entity32 )			1
the result was a stunning conversion - but the @entity4 had lost the @entity5 factor			1
it was later resprayed yellow and then silver before it was bought in 2011 by @entity45 racing star @entity44			1
mr @entity44 , a @entity5 fan who won @entity7 in 1983 , decided to ‘ bite the @entity13 ' and have the car returned to the identical condition as when his @entity49 hero owned it			2
he handed the car over to @entity4 and its @entity53 department which certifies , restores and repairs special cars from the @entity23 marque			2
@entity14 : screen icon @entity5 with the @entity4 before it was sold in the 1970s @entity5 's @entity4 gtb / 4 pictured in its original state in 1966 before @entity5 resprayed it original condition : the motor was silver before @entity5 had it sprayed red @entity4 jumped at the chance to work on the @entity65 / 4 , describing it as ' one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory '			1
they reproduced the roof and buttresses with hand - beaten steel panels , before respraying the car from silver to the dark red which @entity77 star had opted for			2
incredibly , the original rear deck , rear glass and chrome surround , internal rear pillars and other related pieces were reunited following its 1970s roof removal			0
@entity5 's @entity4 as a @entity32 pictured some time in the 2000s when it was yellow @entity44 , pictured here with his wife , had the original silver car re-sprayed to red and fitted the wheels from his @entity32 , which he had previously crashed @entity44 with his son @entity91 who also helped to refit the car @entity93 , director of @entity53 , said : ' @entity53 's ethos is to assist clients and collectors in ensuring that their car accurately reflects how it was when it left the factory			1
' as only ten @entity99 were ever built , as you can imagine , over the years a number of coupes have been converted into replicas , so the client 's decision to restore the car to its original configuration was one we welcomed with open arms			0
' after commissioning the restoration and making various trips back and forth from the factory , @entity44 was delighted with the results and loaned the @entity4 to its museum at the factory in @entity116 , @entity23			1
@entity5 's @entity4 gtb / 4 during restoration work at @entity118 in @entity23 mr @entity44 decided to ¿ bite the @entity13 ' and have the car returned to the identical condition as when his @entity49 hero owned it @entity4 jumped at the chance to work on the @entity5 275 @entity27 / 4 , describing it as ' one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory ' under the bonnet of the @entity4 @entity27 / 4 is a 3.3 - litre v12 engine which develops 300bhp he said : ' i have always wanted a @entity4 275 @entity27 / 4 and the @entity5 ownership of this one certainly added to the appeal			1
aesthetically i think it is one of the most beautiful ferraris			0
' in my opinion , the decision to convert it back was a no brainer , i do n't think any car from the 1960s was quite as beautifully done as it			0
' the finished conversion is outstanding and i could n't praise the @entity53 centre more			0
' @entity5 's @entity4 gtb / 4 after restoration back to how he owned it in the @entity22 in @entity23 with @entity145 , the @entity4 boss under the bonnet of the @entity4 275 @entity27 / 4 is a 3.3 - litre v12 engine which develops 300bhp			1
this gives the sleek sports car a 0 - 60mph time of around 6.5 seconds and a top speed of more than 160mph			0
a @entity4 275 @entity27 / 4 with a @entity53 certificate is typically worth around £ 1 to £ 1.5 million , but a world record £ 1.9 million was paid for a model at auction earlier this month			1
@entity5 took delivery of the car when he was on the set of @entity13 , which was released in 1968 but adding the @entity5 factor helps sends values soaring			2
in 2011 , the racing overall worn by @entity5 in the 1971 film @entity7 sold for more than £ 600,000 at auction			1
during the same year a @entity162 911 once owned by film star sold for £ 830,000 - more than 12 times its typical value			1
but @entity44 , an @entity166 - based @entity45 who spends a lot of time in the @entity169 , is more than happy that @entity4 has seen fit to put the car on show in the new wing of @entity173 which was recently inaugurated by @entity145 where it currently resides today			1
he added : ' at the moment it is in the @entity22 and i am happy to leave it there			0
' @entity4 has announced record profits - by deliberately selling fewer cars			2
the @entity23 manufacturer delivered 6,922 cars in 2013 , a reduction of around 5.4 per cent			0
but the sales drop allows the firm to ' maintain exclusivity ' by selling fewer models to customers who spend more on optional extras			0
as a result , overall revenues were up five per cent to 2.3bn euros , with net profit of £ 246m euros , an increase of 5.4 per cent			0
the @entity169 market grew slightly with 677 cars delivered , setting a new record to become @entity197 's leading market , overtaking @entity198			0
with 2,035 deliveries , the @entity199 was the largest market for @entity4			2
the policy of pushing optional extras is paying off , with 100 per cent of cars sold undergoing some sort of personalisation			2
options on @entity208 cars are notoriously expensive , with dustcaps costing £ 79 and little badges setting back owners £ 675			0
and the firm 's tailor made programme , where buyers can deck their vehicles out with denim seats and other odd materials , continues to grow			0
@entity4 also confirmed its @entity219 was going from strength to strength			2
this part of the company deals with restoring and classifying cherished models such as @entity5 's @entity10 / 4			0
@entity145 , @entity4 president , said : ' this is a very important result that comes as a direct consequence of the huge effort made by everyone			1
' we wanted to maintain a high level of exclusivity , designing amazing products such as the @entity233 , the @entity234 and the just launched @entity235 , the result of significant investment in product and technological innovation			0
' the @entity233 is the @entity23 firm 's fastest and most expensive road car ever			0
it is capable of 220mph and costs £ 1 million			0
but despite its price - tag , the 499 planned were quickly sold with desperate punters rumoured to be willing to pay a £ 500,000 premium to own one .			0
