by @entity0 a @entity2 mother - of - two has criticised a new design of @entity4 nappy claiming it seeps fluid			2
up until three weeks ago @entity7 , 41 , had entrusted her regular @entity4 brand to keep @entity9 , three , and @entity10 , one , well protected			2
however a recent design change has forced her to switch to @entity12 because of repeated and lengthy clean up jobs			0
now other mothers are backing up the claims of leaking and seepage and questioned whether they will ever buy @entity4 again			0
@entity18 had suddenly noticed her tried and true @entity4 brand was failing to keep her two children , @entity21 ( left ) and @entity9 , right , dry ms @entity7 attributes the problems to the new ' thinner look and feel ' of the toddler protective wear			1
before realising the nappy was at fault , she tried changing her childrens ' feeding requirements and taking other fruitless measures to stop the seepage			0
but when she took her complaint to the company itself and wrote about her experience on a @entity2 mother 's @entity39 group - the real reason for the leaks became more apparent			2
' there were about 20 odd days or so where they were leaking all the time , i was having to wash sheets daily and and lay down mattress protectors			0
' she complained to @entity4 directly about their new selling point for the @entity51 and @entity52 varieties which claim to be more ' soft and secure ' than the original , offering a ' new layer designed to absorb wetness and spring back dry			1
' @entity52 and @entity51 varieties have recently undergone a design change but the altered version , which mrs @entity7 said is ' looser ' , appears to be causing more problems than solutions across @entity2 with her complaint posted to @entity39 receiving 41 comments from mums also dealing with the same dilemma of seepage			1
mrs @entity7 said it became evident from reading a label on the packaging that it must have been the new design which was causing the problem			2
' when i posted to the mother 's @entity39 group and found similar problems that 's when i noticed they ( @entity4 ) had changed the design			1
' ' i began to feel it ( the nappy ) when it was on and noticed that it was really loose so i tried a different size but that did n't work			0
' she phoned the @entity4 hotline and the operator told her that they had various complaints of a similar nature of seepage regarding the @entity51 and @entity52 varieties			1
a company spokesperson told her to send back two nappies for testing in the hope of finding a resolution to the problem - and the issue is still being investigated			1
in the meantime , mrs @entity7 has switched to @entity12 - a brand she could not speak more highly of			0
' other mums themselves have also switched over and posted bout how good they are			0

@entity7 , 41 , noticed more nappy seepage in her children
her complaint was shared on @entity39 with other mothers
mothers complained of a similar issue with @entity52 and @entity51 nappies
they *pinpointed* the problem to a change in the design , look and feel
a company operator told her similar complaints had already been *lodged*
the company is testing @entity52 and @entity51 nappies for their *effectiveness*
