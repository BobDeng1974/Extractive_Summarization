if @entity2 fans were sceptical when @entity3 was announced as @entity5 's successor last month then they will be pleasantly surprised now			1
saturday 's impressive comeback against high - flying @entity7 made it six wins in eight @entity11 games under the @entity12 and 19 points from a possible 24			1
@entity2 have reignited their season in some style , scoring 22 goals under their new manager at an average of nearly three per game - and all that with 15 - goal top scorer @entity19 having been ruled out for a year with a knee injury two matches in to @entity3 's reign			1
@entity2 manager @entity3 has led his side to an excellent run of form since taking over @entity27 ( left ) celebrates his goal for @entity2 against @entity7 with @entity29 @entity30 ( right ) accepts the plaudits from @entity32 as @entity2 made it 19 points from 24 @entity36 fans must be wondering where this @entity3 was hiding during his two years at the club			1
widely considered one of the best young @entity40 managers around before he left @entity41 for @entity36 , @entity3 departed @entity42 in october with his managerial reputation tarnished			0
watching @entity36 play in @entity3 ’s final few months - and in truth for the majority of his time at the club - was an uninspiring experience			2
@entity3 the self - assured @entity41 manager became @entity3 the big - headed @entity36 boss - blind to his team 's failings and unwilling to change his methods			2
@entity3 was widely considered one of the best young @entity40 managers around before he left @entity41 his spell with @entity36 was more difficult but he is using a similar system at @entity2 with good results but in reality the character of the man has not changed			1
there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and success is the litmus test			0
he will have learned lessons though from his testing experience at @entity36 - he has to have done if he harbours any hopes of a long and prosperous managerial career - which he does			0
despite the goal glut , @entity3 's system - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 - has not changed from his time at @entity36 but @entity2 's players are clearly responding better			1
his habit of tinkering with his line - up regardless of the previous result frustrated @entity36 fans but appears to have galvanised a @entity2 squad where several players were left on the fringes under @entity5			2
@entity27 blasts in his goal against @entity7 at the @entity84 on saturday in the championship @entity30 ( left ) finishes high into the net on saturday afternoon as @entity2 beat the in - form visitors we can only guess what a manager does aside from his team selection and media comments but sometimes in football a manager and a club just click and sometimes , as with @entity3 and @entity36 , they do not			1
that being said , things clicked at @entity36 in @entity3 's first season in charge for a short while , and sceptics will wonder if this is just a honeymoon period he is enjoying at @entity2			1
a brilliant run of form in early 2013 almost saw @entity36 sneak in to the play - offs and there are parallels with how he has started at @entity2 - though that run was not as instantaneous as this one			0
@entity3 's habit of tinkering with his line - up appears to have galvanised the @entity2 squad several players were left on the fringes of the squad under @entity5 's leadership but that 's changed @entity3 makes an appeal for a decision on the touchline during his time with @entity36 back in may forest owner @entity120 has admitted that @entity3 's future will be assessed at the end of the season but denied claims the @entity12 's contract was only for three months			1
either way , the 18 games he had ahead of him when he took charge have always felt like an audition , a chance to build for next season			0
keep up this form though and , with 10 games to play , @entity2 fans might soon start dreaming of a return to the top flight after a 16 - year absence			0
having been 12th and 13 points off the play - offs when @entity5 left , they are now ninth and nine points off			0
the safe money is still on @entity2 missing out on the top six but having lost momentum at @entity36 in the spring of 2013 , never to get it back , @entity3 will be desperate to keep this going			1
@entity29 is already departing this summer for @entity144 but @entity2 could get promoted @entity145 is also leaving - and @entity2 ca n't afford to be in the @entity11 for much longer with £ 22.9million losses for last season recently announced , the forced sales of @entity145 and @entity29 last summer and having been under a transfer embargo earlier in the season it would appear @entity2 can not afford to be in the @entity11 for much longer			0
their @entity153 owners came in with the target of @entity156 football nearly three years ago and , five managerial departures later , they needed to get this one right			0
@entity159 will tell if this is merely a honeymoon period for @entity3 and @entity2 but it 's a case of so far , so good			2
owner @entity120 has gone through five managerial departures since taking over three years ago good week for ... @entity160			1
three wins in three games under new manager @entity163 - the latest coming against @entity164 - have propelled the @entity165 right in to play - off contention in @entity167			2
the third tier is so tight - just nine points separate 14 clubs from sixth to 19th - that @entity160 have managed to leap 12 places up to seventh in the space of just three weeks			0
bad week for ... @entity173			0
@entity175 's side conceded a last - minute winner against @entity177 to stay firmly rooted at the bottom off the @entity179			0
a point for @entity181 against @entity182 has stretched the gap to @entity185 safety to eight points with just 11 matches remaining			0
@entity189 are firmly rooted at the bottom off the @entity179 and are eight points from safety talent scout : @entity191 ( @entity192 , on loan from @entity194 ) there 's no shortage of promising youngsters at the @entity198 and the latest to hit the headlines is 19 - year - old @entity201 youth international left back @entity191			1
given freedom to attack from wing back in @entity205 's 3 - 5 - 2 system , @entity191 - who was part of the @entity194 ’ @entity208 - winning side two years ago - scored the @entity209 ' third in their 3 - 0 win over @entity211 on saturday			2
@entity191 ( left ) won the @entity208 with @entity194 and is enjoying a good loan at @entity192			2

@entity3 took over as @entity2 manager last month
since then his side have taken 19 points from eight championship games
@entity3 has the *belief* of his players , which he did not have at @entity36
good week for @entity160 who have three wins in three under @entity163
bad week for @entity189 with time close to running out on survival hopes
@entity191 is revelling in his freedom to attack at @entity192
