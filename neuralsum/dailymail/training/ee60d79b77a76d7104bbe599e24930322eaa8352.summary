by @entity0 it is a part of a holiday that many people dread – the moment when they have to extricate themselves from the car - hire kiosk without signing away their lives to a raft of extra charges and financial add - ons			2
that , at least , is the picture that has emerged of @entity16 travellers ’ attitudes to renting a vehicle while away on an exotic escape			0
according to a new survey , almost a third of tourists ( 31 per cent ) feel pressurised during their transactions with car - hire companies , and feel that they are being deliberately scared into buying excess waiver insurance by unscrupulous representatives			1
rip - off : almost one - in - two holidaymakers think car - hire excess insurance polices are too high and almost one in four people – 24 per cent – feel that they have been rail - roaded into purchasing costly additional policies at the car - hire desk			1
the research was conducted by @entity35 on behalf of @entity36			0
it uncovered widespread nervousness about excess insurance – the add - on policies that protect consumers against high charges if a car is lost , damaged or stolen			2
far from reality : many holidaymakers feel the car - hire experience does not match this dream image the amount in question varies from transaction to transaction , but can easily be up to £ 1,500 , depending on the make of vehicle			2
excess sums can be stored on customers ’ credit cards if they decide against taking out excess waiver policies – another cause of concern for holidaymakers			0
figures show that excess deposits in @entity63 have gone up by 22 per cent in the last year – while the price of excess waivers has increased by some 26 per cent			0
almost half of those surveyed – 45 per cent – said that they think the cost of excess policies is ‘ a rip - off ’			1
under pressure : almost a third of @entity16 tourists feel they have been pressurised into buying car - hire extras and almost two thirds – 62 per cent – said they were unaware that they could buy excess waiver policies from providers other than the hire company they are dealing with			1
‘ it ’s a scandal that sky - high deposits are being used as a stick to beat with when people are trying to budget for a break , ’ says @entity81 of @entity82 .			0

@entity16 holidaymakers feel ' scared ' into taking out extra insurance policies
almost half of car renters feel that excess waivers policies are a ' rip - off '
