by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 16:48 est , 5 march 2013 from the lavish invites and a plush location to a show - stopping dress and decadent cake , weddings do n't come cheap			1
but one cash - strapped bride - to - be is so desperate to tie the knot that she has resorted to selling advertising space - on her wedding dress			1
@entity11 , 29 , and her partner @entity12 , 28 , had their hearts set on getting married this year but can not afford their wedding even at a cut price			1
@entity11 and her partner @entity12 are looking for people to sponsor their wedding			1
cash - strapped @entity18 is so desperate to tie the knot she is selling advertising space on her dress @entity22 had bought her wedding dress in anticipation of booking their nuptials but rising costs meant they had to put their plans on hold			1
but now , in a desperate bid to plow ahead with their big day , the couple are looking for sponsors			1
imaginative @entity22 says she is even prepared for her dress and her fiance 's bridal outfit to be covered in logos and adverts if it helps them bring in the funds they need			1
the couple , who met two years ago , say they are happy to sit down and discuss ideas with the individual businesses about how they can advertise the services they provide them with on the day			2
mother - of - one @entity22 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , said they did n't want anything ' big and fancy ' but they hoped companies would back their idea			2
she said : ' i started planning eagerly last year but due to the economic climate it 's all had to be put on hold for the foreseeable future			2
the couple say they are happy to sit down and discuss ideas with the individual businesses about how they can advertise the services they provide them with on the day ' my fiance works full time and we have even moved in with my parents so that we can save			2
' we want a church wedding because it 's a bit more traditional , but with church fees , venue fees , catering , rings , suits , @entity72 even for the most basic of weddings , it just was n't possible for us to do it this year			2
' we do n't want a big fancy wedding but even the most basic of packages is too expensive			2
' doing everything on a budget we reckon it will still cost between £ 3,000 and £ 5,500			1
' while some couples might not want to get married in 2013 because they 're a little superstitious we 'd love to get married this year - after all , we just want to say " i do "			0
' we would even be willing to have any advertising for any companies that would be kind enough to help us out			0
' we 'd be willing to talk about signs on my dress and the back of suits , all we 'd ask is that they could be removed for photographs			1
and @entity22 is n't alone in offering herself up for sponsorship			0
in japan some women are renting out their bare legs for companies to market their products in return for payment			0
with the notion that a good advertisement should be put where everyone 's eyes are drawn , an attractive woman 's limbs seem like the perfect idea - and sure enough , the clever marketing strategy is proving a huge hit with businesses all across @entity111			0
as of november 2012 , about 1,300 girls have already registered their legs as ad space with @entity115 , and the number keeps increasing			0
@entity117 , forearms , hands and backs have all been covered in marketing messages and in @entity122 , about 1,300 girls have already registered their legs as ad space with @entity115 participating women get their legs stamped with an ad and go on with their usual life - albeit wearing a short skirt or shorts and showing off their pins as much as possible			1
as long as the ad is showing on their legs for eight hours a day or more , their job is done , and they are paid a part of the advertising fee			0
and this is n't a completely new idea			0
the first ' skinvertisement ' was sold in 2003 on the back of the head of an @entity140 man named @entity141			0
@entity142 paid mr @entity141 $ 7,000 for the ink and the promise that he would leave the logo for at least five years			0
if you guessed that the tattoo outlasted the company , you 'd be right .			0

@entity12 , 28 , and @entity11 , 29 , plan to wed on an *extreme* budget
they are prepared for her dress and his bridal outfit to be covered in logos
only *condition* is that adverts later be removed from the photographs
