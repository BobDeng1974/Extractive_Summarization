travellers living at the @entity10 gipsy and traveller site in @entity11 , near @entity12 , @entity13 ( pictured ) , have contacted council chiefs to complain about plans to expand the current 20 - pitch site by 11 caravans the council was given funding to carry out the works earlier this year and must purchase adjacent farm land to accommodate the extended site boundary			1
residents at @entity10 said there was a divide over the council plans between those who had been there for decades and newcomers			1
one elderly resident said there would be an exodus to local car parks in protest at the expansion , if it went ahead			2
he told @entity54 : ' most people here are happy with the way things are and do n't want this changed			0
' this site is already overcrowded and expanding it will only attract more people , it 's like an advertisement			2
' if it goes ahead people will be heading for @entity12 and setting up in the first car park they come to			0
that 's what i 'll be doing			0
' we have lived here since it opened 30 years ago , a lot of people have , but this will drive them back to their old way of life			2
' he added : ' if this expansion happens there will be overcrowding at local schools and at the doctors			2
' the council would be better off saving its money			2
we are happy with things the way they are			0
' @entity93 , a councillor in @entity11 , said : ' if you live in a lovely , countryside area , in a close - knit community , would you want strangers coming in ? ' @entity98 , another long term resident at the site , said : ' it 's not a question of the people , it 's the space			2
' how would these councillors suddenly like a lot of houses built opposite where they live ? nobody wants that			0
' but mother - of - seven @entity108 , 30 , originally from @entity109 , welcomed the expansion plans			1
she said : ' i know some people here are against this but they tend to be the older generation			0
' people here with families support the expansion			2
the children would like to see a park built as well			0
' i think more people should be able to come here if they want			0
there are more people for this than against			0
' @entity93 , a councillor in @entity11 , said he has been approached by about a third of the travellers who live at the site and object to the council 's plans			1
he told @entity54 : ' i have been approached by some members of the community that do n't want an expansion on the site			1
' out of the residents on the site , there are about a third that are vehemently opposed to any expansion			1
' they are closed communities , very family - orientated and about a third are not supportive to the point that they are trying to start a petition to prevent the council from going ahead			1
' about another third are not bothered one way or another what happens , while another third would encourage more travellers to the site			1
' he agreed that those who object to the expansion of the site are against it because they are worried about new travellers disrupting the camp			1
he said : ' people think gipsies come and go , but there are some at the site which have been there for more than 40 years			1
' they are entrenched there			0
if you live in a lovely , countryside area , in a close - knit community , would you want strangers coming in ? i think that 's the perception they have			0
one elderly resident said there would be an exodus to local car parks in protest at the move , if it went ahead ' they are all related or close friends , they do n't want people to come in and disrupt the harmony			0
' they do n't want bad neighbours , to put it simply			2
' there 's sometimes a fear of the unknown			0
their fear is that if someone bad turns up then it would cause problems on the site			0
' mr @entity93 said the expansion of the site would occur over the next 15 years , if given the go - ahead			1
@entity190 , director of environment at @entity22 , said there was a need for additional pitches up to 2026 and confirmed a consultation process has been launched			0
he said : ' this planning application proposes the provision of additional pitches as a means to address this proposed need			0
