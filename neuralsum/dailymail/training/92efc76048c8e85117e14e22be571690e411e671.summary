the @entity0 has been called in , hundreds of families have been forced to evacuate their homes , and small businesses are wondering if they ’ll ever be able to reopen			2
but it ’s not bad news for all the inhabitants of the @entity7			2
the river ’s population of @entity10 is safe			0
as residents faced an uncertain future , it emerged the @entity14 rejected calls to dredge the flood - hit lower reaches of the @entity18 because of the presence of the endangered mollusc			1
and even though a public consultation indicated support for de-silting work , the quango said it would be ‘ environmentally unacceptable ’ due to the ‘ high impact on aquatic species ’			1
but last night a spokesman at the @entity14 said the report on mussels was ‘ badly worded ’ and the presence of the mussels would not have been the only argument against dredging			1
‘ if protected species are living in a river and dredging would reduce the risk of flooding then we would ensure that dredging occurs without having a serious impact on wildlife , ’ he said			1
‘ this is case not just for the @entity18 but all rivers			0
’ saved , but at what cost : the endangered @entity67 but he added ; ‘ an independent study carried out by engineering firm @entity70 has shown that the natural activity of the @entity26 removes significantly more silt than mechanical dredging would do			2
’ the revelation came as it emerged that @entity76 waste regulations have made regular dredging on @entity79 ’s rivers uneconomic			0
documents released under the @entity81 revealed that the disposal of silt became so complex and expensive that it was more attractive to take advantage of financial incentives given by @entity86 to conservation schemes			0
@entity88 describing that stretch of the river as one of the ‘ largest and most at - risk developed and undefended flood plains in @entity95 ’			1
hundreds of houses on the @entity18 are presently under water and there are fears the situation could get worse			2
the @entity26 river has hit record levels causing extensive flooding to parts of the southeast of @entity95 the @entity67 , the name of which comes from the flattened shape of its shell , is categorised by environmentalists as ‘ vulnerable and threatened ’ , with the number of rivers it lives in declining by 30 per cent in the past 25 years			2
however , some believe the @entity79 actually has the healthiest populations in @entity115 , with the possible exception of @entity117			0
one river - the @entity119 - may have 1.2million of the mussels alone			1
the agency ’s report said : ‘ a number of protected and threatened species are known to be present in the waters of the @entity26 , including the @entity67 , which is a @entity127 species , and on the @entity128 as near - threatened			1
‘ this poses a constraint on any works to be undertaken within the @entity18 itself , especially activities such as dredging			0
’ a ‘ strategy appraisal report ’ , compiled by the agency into the prospect of defence works on the @entity26 in august 2010 , said dredging was one of the ‘ options rejected at preliminary stage ’			0
the @entity14 described that stretch of the river as one of the ' largest and most at - risk developed and undefended flood plains in @entity95 ' however , the previous year the @entity14 held a public consultation with residents along the banks of the @entity18 , and the official report shows that they thought ‘ dredging of pinch points of the @entity18 is essential to provide interim relief from flooding ’			1
@entity158 mps said they were appalled that the @entity14 appeared to be more interested in promoting the welfare of molluscs than householders			1
@entity162 said : ‘ ever since we have given responsibility for flood defences to this central quango , they ’ve elevated the interests of the natural over and above the human			0
' we can see the consequences today			0
there is nothing nice about letting our rivers and coastline revert to nature			0
@entity176 used to be a swamp , and if we leave these clowns in charge it will return to that			0
’ @entity181 , @entity158 mp for the flood - affected @entity26 - side constituency of @entity184 , said : ‘ the priority has to be protecting people and property not mussels			1
ultimately , any decision on dredging any river has to take into account the impact on communities living further downstream			0
’ regular dredging was undertaken for 50 years on the stretch of river from @entity37 to @entity38 following the 1947 floods , but was stopped in 1996 when the agency took over responsibility .			1

the endangered mollusc halted calls to dredge strife - hit stretch of water
@entity14 put welfare of ' aquatic species ' before residents
@entity14 claims the mussels were not the only reason it was *n't* dredged
*140,000* people back @entity35 's *petition* - which you can sign here - for @entity217 to use *foreign* aid cash to tackle floods
