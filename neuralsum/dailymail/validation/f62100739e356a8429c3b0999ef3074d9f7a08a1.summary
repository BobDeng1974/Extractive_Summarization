cancer survival rates in @entity2 lag more than ten years behind those in many other @entity5 countries , experts warn			1
even for breast cancer – one of the most treatable forms of the disease – the figures are still well below those reached by @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 in the late 1990s			1
for lung cancer , the rates are so far behind that patients in @entity2 are now half as likely to survive as those living in @entity19			2
@entity20 has described the situation as ‘ shameful ’ and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in @entity5			1
cancer survival rates in @entity2 lag more than ten years behind those in many other @entity5 countries , despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the @entity2 's survival rates ( file picture , posed by models ) and despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years – £ 640million invested by @entity30 in the early 2000s and £ 750million by the @entity31 – @entity2 does not appear to have gained any ground			1
in 2002 @entity30 increased @entity34 tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then chancellor @entity37 specifically to pay for major improvements in the @entity39 , notably cancer care			0
but only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by @entity45 warned of ‘ unacceptable ’ variation in care			2
data analysed by @entity49 shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in @entity2 survive five years			1
this is a lower rate than @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 in the late 1990s , when the figure was 83 per cent			0
in these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher			1
for bowel cancer , 54 per cent of @entity2 can expect to survive five years , whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in @entity57 and 55 per cent in @entity58 , the @entity59 and @entity12			1
the five - year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries , including @entity19 , @entity64 and @entity14 , it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s			2
@entity65 , chief executive of @entity20 , said : ‘ frankly , this is shameful			0
what we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable			1
‘ if countries like @entity13 , @entity12 , @entity57 and @entity19 can achieve these rates , then the @entity2 can , and should , bridge the gap			2
’ experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough , before it has spread to other organs			0
it may also be down to patients not being offered the newest , most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures , which are routinely available in other countries			0
this is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail			0
experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the @entity39 can not cope with the ever - increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer			2
it is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes			0
the figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of @entity5 countries carried out by researchers at the @entity107 , known as the ‘ @entity109 programme ’			1
meanwhile , the latest monthly @entity39 statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as x-rays , ct scans or ultrasounds – up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since february 2008			0
it follows a report by @entity45 warning of ‘ unacceptable ’ and ‘ unexplained ’ variation in cancer detection and treatment across @entity123 – particularly for the elderly			0
@entity125 , of @entity123 , said : ‘ we are diagnosing and treating more people than ever before and as a result the @entity39 is helping more people than ever survive cancer			0

cancer survival rates more than 10 years behind other @entity5 countries
breast cancer survival rates in @entity2 below those achieved by others in 1990s
figures despite @entity2 *spending* billions to improve situation last 15 years
@entity49 said it was ‘ shameful ’ and proves better rates not unachievable
