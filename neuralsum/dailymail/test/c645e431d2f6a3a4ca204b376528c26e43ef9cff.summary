a population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the @entity2 to freely roam the plains of @entity4 for the first time in over a century			2
the moment was captured on video and shows @entity9 biologist @entity8 leading 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile			1
the land mammals were freed from a temporary pen , where they had been kept for just over a week during the transition , and followed mr @entity8 to their new home			1
they journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the @entity22 before reaching the grass meadows of @entity24 , which is surrounded by the @entity25			1
@entity26 are @entity27 ’s largest land mammal , but the native @entity4 species disappeared from the state more than 100 years ago			2
in the video the animals can be seen chasing after the snowmobile in a herd from within side a fenced track			2
@entity26 were imported from @entity36 to the @entity37 in 2008 but restoration of the threatened species was delayed			0
the population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the @entity2 for first time in over a century @entity9 biologist @entity8 lead 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile landowners did n't want their property listed as critical habitat with additional federal oversight			1
the state and federal governments agreed to consider the @entity4 wood bison as ' experimental ' without the usual @entity54 requirements			2
with the help of corporate and non-profit sponsors , the department moved 50 cows and 50 juveniles aged two or less to the village			0
but the task was not without its risks as the large mammals were vulnerable to broken limbs , or if they fell , trampling			0
two wood bison bulls photographed grazing at the @entity37 in @entity68 , @entity4 @entity70 bison cows resting and grazing at the @entity37 in @entity68 , @entity4 @entity9 biologist @entity71 , said : ‘ when you 're transporting a very large , not completely domesticated animal , you always have to worry about injuries			1
’ to minimize jostling in the cargo plane the juveniles were transported in small groups within special bison boxes			0
cows had individual pens , which provided them with enough room to stand for the one - hour drive from the conservation centre to @entity85 and a one - hour flight to the village			0
once arrived , the bison moved on their own from the boxes to the snow - covered fields in a fenced area outside @entity95			0
the land mammals chased after the snowmobile , which dropped alfalfa cubes , in a herd from within side a fenced track the wood bison journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the @entity22 before reaching the grass meadows of @entity24 ms @entity71 said : ‘ some of them trotted out , some of them galloped out			1
some of them made it all the way to the opposite end of the pen , as far away from people as they could get			0
‘ some of them stopped 15 feet from the box and started eating hay			0
’ over the next seven to 14 days the bison were moved on a daily basis from one pen to another to keep them from settling into one place			0
before the snowmobile coaxed them with alfalfa cubes and led them to their new permanent location , which should start producing an abundance of sedge – one of the bison ’s natural foods – once the snow melts			1
like we never left ! the bison arrive at their new home , which will have sedge for them to feed on once the snow melts			1

@entity9 biologist delivered the animals
the land mammals followed his snowmobile dropping alfalfa cubes
they travelled a mile and crossed the @entity22 to @entity24
new location should start producing sedge for the bison to feed on
