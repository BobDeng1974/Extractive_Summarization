by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 03:41 est , 5 october 2012 the ancient @entity1 had prosthetic toes - and they still hold up today , according to research from the @entity4			1
two ancient replica toes - one found on the foot of a mummy - suggested that the @entity1 were had prosthetic body parts			1
now , for the first time in nearly 3,000 years , researchers have tried ' walking like an @entity1 ' - and confirmed the replica toes did help those missing one of their own , particularly when wearing sandals			1
false toe : the replica , presumed to date from around @entity17 , was found near on a mummy in @entity19 researcher dr @entity20 wanted to find out how successful the two discovered toes were at helping people walk			1
the first toe was created from wood and leather , and dates from between 950 to @entity26 , and was found on a female mummy buried near @entity28 in @entity1			1
the second one is the @entity31 artificial toe from before @entity32 , and made of cartonnage ( a sort of papier maché mixture made using linen , glue and plaster )			0
both display significant signs of wear and their design features also suggest they may have been more than cosmetic additions			0
dr @entity20 says : ' several experts have examined these objects and had suggested that they were the earliest prosthetic devices in existence			0
' there are many instances of the ancient @entity1 creating false body parts for burial but the wear plus their design both suggest they were used by people to help them to walk			1
' the toe , seen here both attached and un-attached , appears to have been designed to be worn with sandals dr @entity20 , who is based in the @entity61 ' @entity60 for @entity62 , recruited two volunteers who were both missing their right big toe			0
design replicas of the ancient toes were made to fit each volunteer along with replica leather ancient @entity1 style sandals			1
the tests were carried out at the @entity71 at @entity73 's @entity72			0
each volunteer was asked to walk on a 10 metre walkway bare foot , in their own shoes and wearing the replicas with and without the sandals			0
their movement was tracked using 10 cameras and the pressure of their footsteps was measured using a mat. the 10 best walking trials were recorded for each foot , using their normal left foot as the control			0
walk like an @entity1 : the big toe was put to use , with volunteers saying the replica sandals made for a comfortable walking experience it was surprising how well both volunteers were able to walk using these devices although one volunteer performed much better than the other			1
the camera footage revealed that when wearing the sandals with the cartonnage replica , one of the volunteers achieved 87 per cent of the flexion achieved by their normal left toe			0
the three part wood and leather design produced nearly 78 per cent			0
interestingly the ability to push off using the prosthetic toe was not as good when this volunteer was n't wearing the sandals			1
the second volunteer was still able to produce between 60 - 63 per cent flexion wearing the replicas with or without the sandals			2
an ancient @entity1 kingdom close to the @entity119 collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change , according to new research			2
during @entity1 ’s @entity125 - the pyramid - building time - 4,200 years ago , droughts and fires plagued the region , causing famine and social unrest			1
scientists examined 7,000 - year - old ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the @entity119 to piece together the time - and found evidence of a ' mega drought ' in the the area			2
@entity135 , of the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) , said : ' even the mighty builders of the ancient pyramids more than 4,000 years ago fell victim when they were unable to respond to a changing climate			0
' this study illustrates that water availability was the climate - change @entity143 then for @entity1 , as it may well be now , for a planet topping seven billion thirsty people			2
' when wearing the replicas the pressure measurements showed that for both volunteers there were no overly high pressure points			2
this indicated that the false toes were not causing any undue discomfort or possible tissue damage			1
however , when the volunteers wore just the replica sandals without the false toes the pressure being applied under the foot rose sharply			1
dr @entity20 says : " the pressure data tells us that it would have been very difficult for an ancient @entity1 missing a big toe to walk normally wearing traditional sandals			0
' they could of course remained bare foot or perhaps have worn some sort of sock or boot over the false toe , but our research suggests that wearing these false toes made walking in a sandal more comfortable			1
' alongside the test data dr @entity20 also asked her volunteers to fill in a questionnaire about how they felt when doing the trials in the gait laboratory			0
despite it having performed well the comfort scores for the cartonnage replica were disappointing although it was felt to be an excellent cosmetic replacement			0
describing the performance of the three part wooden and leather toe both volunteers found this one to be extremely comfortable , scoring it highly , one volunteer commenting that with time he could get used to walking in it			0
assessing the volunteers ' experience dr @entity20 said : " it was very encouraging that both volunteers were able to walk wearing the replicas			0
' now that we have the gait analysis data and volunteer feedback alongside the obvious signs of wear we can provide a more convincing argument that the original artefacts had some intended prosthetic function			0
' the findings from this study , which have been published in full in the @entity205 , means the earliest known prosthetic is now more likely to come from ancient @entity1			2
the three part example pre-dates by some 400 years what is currently thought to be the oldest , although untested , prosthetic device			1
this is a bronze and wooden leg that was found in a @entity214 burial in @entity215 , @entity216			2
that has been dated to 300 @entity17 although only a replica now remains as the original was destroyed in a bombing raid over @entity221 during the war .			1

disabled volunteers tested replicas of @entity1 false toes - and found them good enough for daily use
tests push back the age of prosthetics by 400 years
previous oldest prosthetic - from @entity214 - was destroyed in bombing raids over @entity221 in @entity235
