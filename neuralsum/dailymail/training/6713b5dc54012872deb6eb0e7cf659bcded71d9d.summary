prosecutors , however , described @entity20 as a gold digger who hired a former boyfriend to kill businessman @entity24 to collect on a $ 2 million life insurance policy			1
they say she wanted the payout to maintain her lavish lifestyle as her finances dwindled			0
it 's been nearly two decades since @entity24 died when his car exploded as he was leaving a @entity9 - area country club after playing golf			1
defendant @entity20 listens to her attorney talk to the jury as opening arguments commenced today @entity36 and the @entity38 's office look over the car in which @entity9 developer @entity24 was killed when it exploded in the @entity41 parking lot in @entity9 authorities say @entity43 paid ex-boyfriend @entity44 $ 400,000 to carry out the hit			1
@entity44 was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to two life terms in prison , but jurors are n't allowed to consider his case while determining @entity51 ' fate			1
@entity43 , 56 , has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder			2
' @entity24 lived on the edge , the financial edge ... he borrowed a lot of money from all sorts of people , many people who maybe were connected with organized crime , ' defense attorney @entity57 told jurors			0
' that 's who we think did this			0
that 's who killed @entity24 , not @entity20			2
' prosecutors presented a wildly different theory of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and found herself struggling financially with an easy way out			0
' there is one reason that @entity24 was murdered			0
he was murdered because his death benefited @entity20 in a big way - $ 2 million is a hell of a motive , ' prosecutor @entity78 said			1
@entity44 ( left ) was convicted of killing @entity24 ( right ) in 2010 and is serving two life sentences @entity24 was a developer who made millions investing in @entity86 bingo halls and slot - machine parlors in @entity88 and @entity89 before @entity90 authorized tribes to open full - blown casinos			1
but after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests , @entity24 went broke			0
that 's around the time @entity43 filed for divorce , prosecutors say , because @entity24 could no longer support her expensive tastes			1
' all of a sudden , the lifestyle that this defendant insisted on and expected was no longer there , ' @entity101 said			0
the couple , who had two children together , separated , but @entity43 remained the beneficiary of @entity24 's insurance policy , paying the premiums herself			1
she eventually moved to @entity5 and worked in real estate before meeting @entity44			0
the two would soon hatch a plan to kill @entity24 and collect on the policy , @entity101 said			2
' they were talking about it for years , ' @entity101 said			0
defendant @entity116 , center , listens to her attorney as opening arguments started in her trial today @entity44 later left @entity5 while being investigated by police for fraud , and turned up in @entity9 briefly in the summer of 1996			2
' the reason he comes to @entity9 was that he and @entity20 had already agreed to kill @entity24 , ' @entity101 said			1
after the killing , @entity44 was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in @entity7 on fraud charges while @entity43 was sending him money for the hit , eventually adding up to $ 400,000 , @entity101 told jurors			1
the investigation into @entity24 's killing stalled until @entity44 's arrest in 2005			2
authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial transactions with @entity43 , including recorded telephone conversations and invoices			2
@entity101 said police also found divorce records pertaining to @entity43 and @entity24 in a van rented by @entity44			1
that 's when @entity44 and @entity43 became the key suspects			2
by then , @entity43 had received the $ 2 million insurance payout and had left @entity5 for a life abroad			1
she was arrested in @entity148 in 2009 and extradited to @entity9			0
her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time			0
@entity43 ' attorneys , meanwhile , say the evidence against her is flimsy , and that @entity43 was already wealthy with her own money			0
they say @entity44 did n't even kill @entity24 , raising the specter that it could have been a hit by a jilted investor , one of whom @entity24 was about to file a $ 10 million lawsuit against			1
' so when the state tells you that nobody else had anything to benefit from @entity24 's death ... that 's just not true , ' @entity57 said			0
' there 's people out there that are angry with him ... and remember , benefit can be driven by revenge			0
