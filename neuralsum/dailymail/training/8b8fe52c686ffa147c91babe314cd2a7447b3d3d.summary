@entity5 , 34 , won 114 caps for @entity4 , scoring 21 goals in the 14 years since his debut			2
the @entity9 midfielder captained his country at the @entity15 in @entity16 this summer but they went out in the group stage and he has decided to call it a day on the international stage			1
walking away : @entity5 has announced his retirement from international football after 14 years the tenacious midfielder has won the third highest number of caps for @entity4 : 1			2
@entity33 - 9 @entity5 , who is @entity4 's third most capped player ever , behind @entity26 and @entity25 , said : ' i have enjoyed every minute of representing my country and it is a sad day for me knowing that i wo n’t pull on the @entity4 shirt again			1
' however , i do look forward to continuing my strong relationship with the @entity39 and helping out in any way i can going forward			0
' i ’d like to firstly thank my family and friends for all their support throughout my @entity4 journey			2
' i ’d also like to thank everyone who has been part of my international career , from the @entity4 managers i ’ve played under to the staff at the @entity39 and , of course , all the players i ’ve been fortunate to play alongside			0
' in particular , the supporters have been amazing , not least in @entity16 when they got behind the team despite the disappointing results			0
the cap fits : @entity5 played his first international in 2000 under @entity57 , against @entity58 delight : ' i have enjoyed every minute of representing my country , ' said the former @entity4 skipper back then : @entity5 made his @entity4 debut alongside the likes of @entity64 14 years ago @entity66 statement : @entity5 took to @entity67 to announce his retirement who should be @entity4 's next captain ? who should be @entity4 's next captain ? now share your opinion ' i ’d especially like to thank @entity74 [ @entity75 ] , firstly for giving me the captaincy permanently when he took the job , making me the proudest man in the country and allowing me to fulfill my childhood dream			1
' he has been very understanding over the past few weeks and is a man i will always hold in the highest regard			0
' this has been a very difficult decision , one of the toughest i ’ve had to make in my career			1
' i have agonised over this since coming back from @entity16 and have spoken to family , friends and people close to me in the game before coming to this point			0
captain : @entity5 leads the way for @entity9 during training at @entity94 on monday lean on : @entity5 uses midfield partner @entity95 for support during @entity9 's training session knees - up : the @entity9 captain has said he is focusing on their upcoming @entity8 campaign ton up : the @entity4 captain won his 100th cap in 2012 , when @entity4 met @entity103 in a friendly end of an era : @entity5 applauds the @entity4 fans after his final international appearance against @entity107 celebration : @entity5 returned to his primary school when he won his 100th cap to celebrate with the pupils caps : 114 ( 38 as captain ) goals : 21 @entity115 cards : 1 ' most importantly , @entity116 [ @entity117 ] has been fantastic and obviously i have to look after my body as much as possible to ensure i can give everything when i take to the field			1
' to ensure i can keep playing to a high level and giving everything to @entity9 i believe this is the right decision , and having @entity8 football back at @entity126 is another big factor in my decision			2
' ' i do feel as if i could probably still play for @entity4 in september , october , november , i 'm still in great physical condition , ' @entity5 continued			0
' but - big picture-wise - over the next two , three , four years , the best thing for my body where i stand now is to step aside out of the international fold ' passion : being made @entity4 captain made @entity5 the proudest man in the country , he claimed ' the most important thing for me was not to make an emotional decision or rash decision			1
i was asked questions before during and after the @entity15 to make a decsion on my future and it was n't the right time			0
' it was important that i came away from football , i had some time to be alone , time to be with my close family and friends and basically discuss and talk about what 's going to be the best decision for me moving forward			0
' the first time i spoke to @entity74 properly was this week , i had tried to have an initial chat with him straight after the @entity15 but i was too emotional to talk to him , i was still very upset with how the @entity15 went			0
iconic : a young @entity5 scored a stunning goal in @entity4 's 5 - 1 victory over @entity156 in 2001 heartache : the midfielder was one of @entity4 's penalty villains as they crashed out of the 2006 @entity15 good times : @entity5 's 21 goals for his country put him 20th on the list of @entity4 all - time top goalscorers ' what i 'll always remember the supporters for is the reception the fans gave me straight after the @entity107 game - we 'd just gone out of the @entity15 at the first stage , it had n't gone well for myself personally or the team and they gave me an unbelievable reception and that 's what 's sticking in my mind			1
' i 'd have loved nothing better than to carry on and continue to fight for the @entity4 fans moving forward but there is a time when you 're a football player where you 've got to make the right decision , when you 've got to be selfish			2
' having made his debut under @entity57 in 2000 , @entity5 played in six major tournaments , scoring twice in the 2006 @entity15 as @entity4 reached the quarter - finals			1
debate : his career was constantly dogged by the question of whether he could play with @entity30 sad end : the @entity192 in @entity16 could have been a glorious ending - but it ended in humiliation his career was always dogged by an inability to thrive alongside @entity30 in the centre of midfield , but he will be fondly remembered for a 20 - yard strike against @entity156 during the 5 - 1 win in 2001 , and a superb strike against @entity201 in the 2006 @entity15			0
however he was also part of the @entity4 team that lost 3 - 2 to @entity203 at @entity204 to miss out on qualification to @entity206 , and captained his country during their turgid 2010 @entity15 campaign in the absence of @entity211			2
having been made permanent skipper by @entity75 , he started both of @entity4 's meaningful games in @entity16 as they lost to @entity216 and @entity217 to exit the @entity15 after two games for the first time ever			1
a remarkable 110 of his 114 caps came from the start , and his 21 goals make leave him 20th on the all - time list of @entity4 goalscorers .			0

@entity4 captain earned 114 @entity4 caps since his debut in 2000
@entity9 midfielder captained @entity75 's team in 2014 @entity15
@entity5 says ' it is a sad day for me knowing that i wo n’t pull on the @entity4 shirt again '
@entity4 captaincy ' made me the proudest man in the country '
gives up @entity4 to ensure @entity9 can stay in @entity8
captain thanks family , friends and fans for their support
