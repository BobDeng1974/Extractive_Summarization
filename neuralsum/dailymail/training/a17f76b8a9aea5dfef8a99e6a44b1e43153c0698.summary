this is in addition to the @entity5 mini with @entity6 which has a 7 - inch screen , compared to the @entity5 ’s 9.7 - inch display			1
this announcement , coupled with @entity1 ’s earlier statement about the @entity53 , signals a fundamental shift from @entity1 to widen its appeal and attract more customers , especially in emerging markets			1
the @entity5 4 , pictured , was discontinued in october following the announcement of the firm 's flagship @entity10 , leaving the ipad 2 as the cheaper , entry - level device			1
with this latest announcement , @entity1 's @entity25 becomes an entry - level 9.7 - inch tablet but with higher specifications both devices appear to be @entity1 's way of offering devices with higher - end specifications to people with smaller budgets - although the prices are still much higher than products from @entity75 , @entity76 and other rivals			1
casting its net wider , and appealing to mid-tier and high - tier customers , is a tactic succesfully used by its major rival @entity82			1
reports claim @entity1 introduced the @entity86 version and dropped because the colourful device is now price selling as well as expected			2
the new model comes with @entity90 of storage and costs £ 429 - half the size of the next model up , and £ 40 cheaper			1
it is available directly from @entity1 's online stores in the @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , but not the @entity102 @entity1 's latest version of its @entity3 comes with @entity90 of storage and costs £ 429 - half the size of the next model up , and £ 40 cheaper			1
it is available directly from @entity1 's online store but is only appearing in certain regions , including @entity97 , pictured , @entity101 and @entity100 , but not in the @entity102 manufacturer @entity109 is said to be gearing up to start production of @entity1 's next handset , dubbed @entity3 6			1
reports claim production will begin in the ' second quarter ' of this year ahead of a september launch			0
the @entity3 is expected to launch in two different models - one with a 4.7 - inch display and one with a 5.7 - inch display			2
there are also claims the handset will have a display made of super-strong sapphire glass after @entity1 announced plans to open a mineral plant in @entity125 , in conjunction with sapphire crystal makers @entity127			0
images of a so - called @entity130 leaked earlier this week , hinting the tech giant might follow @entity82 's lead and add fitness and health tracking features to an upcoming device			2
it is not yet clear why this is			0
network operator @entity138 has also released tariff prices , starting at £ 28 a month for 500 minutes , unlimited texts and @entity142 data – although customers will need to pay £ 49.99 for the handset upfront			0
aside from the drop in memory , the @entity53 is identical to the @entity21 and @entity148 models in terms of other specifications			0
there is an £ 80 price difference between the @entity21 and @entity27 versions - £ 469 and £ 549 respectively			1
the @entity3 was launched at the same time as @entity1 ’s high - end model , the @entity154 , in september			1
despite the company posting record sales figures for the final quarter of last year , it ’s believed the bulk of these were made up with the @entity154 , which starts at £ 549 for @entity21			0
further reports claimed at least a million of the cheaper models are sitting in warehouses because demand is lower than anticipated			0

the @entity3 , pictured , was launched in september			0
reports earlier this year claimed at least a million of the cheaper handsets are sitting in warehouses because demand is lower than anticipated by comparison , @entity76 's @entity172 , pictured , released in august , comes in a range of colours , like the @entity3 , has a 4.5 - inch screen , compared to @entity1 's 4 - inch display , and comes with @entity90 of storage for just £ 135			1
this is a more than third of the price for @entity1 's latest low - end handset since 2007 , @entity1 ’s handsets have been seen as high - end devices			2
the release of the @entity3 signalled a move away from this and saw the @entity187 - based firm take aim at emerging markets such as @entity101			2
despite @entity1 posting record sales figures for the final quarter of last year , it 's believed the bulk of these were made up with the @entity154 , pictured @entity1 ’s biggest rival @entity82 is popular in @entity197 markets particularly because of the lower prices , colourful and plastic designs , and larger screens			2
the @entity3 ticked only one of these three boxes and is still more expensive and smaller than its rivals ' handsets			0
the @entity187 - based company is also expected to add a new @entity3 to its smartphone line later this year , dubbed @entity3 6			0
fewer phone manufacturers are releasing phones with @entity86 storage because demand is a lot lower			0
handsets come pre-installed with the operating system , and various files , and this immediately reduces the amount of available storage			0
on the larger @entity3 and @entity220 models , these built - in files take up around @entity221			0
if the @entity86 model follows suit , users will get just half of the allocated space			0
by comparison , @entity76 ’s @entity172 handset , released in august , comes in a range of colours , like the @entity3 , has a 4.5 - inch screen , compared to @entity1 ’s 4 - inch display , and comes with @entity86 for just £ 135			1
this is a more than third of the price for @entity1 ’s low - end handset			2
however , @entity1 may have targeted these areas due to the rising popularity of @entity238 , also known as @entity239			0
@entity238 is pretty well established in the @entity102 , for example , but it is still being gradually introduced across the @entity97 and other similar markets			0
by dropping the price of the @entity3 , @entity1 may be trying to attract people who want an @entity238 handset without paying the top prices			2
analysts have also claimed @entity1 's @entity3 mid-tier market is showing signs of growing year over year , and may be another reason for the launch of the @entity3 and change in the @entity5 line - up .			2

@entity1 is bringing back its @entity5 with @entity254 , also known as @entity5
available in @entity21 , prices start at £ 329 ( $ 399 ) - *previously* £ 399 ( $ *499* )
firm has also discontinued its @entity5 2 , making its @entity5 4 the new entry - level 9.7 - inch tablet
this announcement follows the launch of @entity1 ’s @entity53
both signal a shift from @entity1 to appeal to wider , more emerging , markets
it also follows @entity82 's lead to attract mid and high - tier customers
@entity1 ’s @entity3 is now available in @entity86 , @entity21 and @entity27 versions
the smaller device costs £ 429 - £ 49 cheaper than the @entity21 version
