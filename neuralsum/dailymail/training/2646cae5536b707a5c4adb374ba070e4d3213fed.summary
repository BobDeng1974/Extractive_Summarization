cafe owner @entity62 said at first he was taken aback by the council 's order			1
' we were a little bit shocked because we did n't realise we needed to get a @entity91 [ development approval ] for a cubby house , ' he told @entity94 's today			1
mr @entity62 has met with @entity16 mayor @entity95 about the cubby house ' we understood the reason they gave us but at the end of the day it 's not a fixed structure			1
it 's just a little small cubby house			2
' mr @entity62 has met with @entity16 mayor @entity95 and said it was going to take a lot of money to keep the cubby house but it was something they were willing to do			1
but there were no guarantees from ms @entity112 that the cubby house could stay			0
