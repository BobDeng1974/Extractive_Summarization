by @entity0 published : 03:31 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 05:06 est , 26 april 2012 one of the richest men in the world says a £ 1.7m painting he bought at @entity5 is a fake , and today he takes his fight to the @entity8 to get his money back			1
prolific art collector and oil tycoon , @entity10 , says the nude painting he bought in 2005 could not possibly be by prominent @entity14 artist @entity13 - as it was signed years after his death			1
the 56 - year - old , believed to be worth more than £ 7bn and rated 64th richest person in the world , is calling on a bank of top art experts to prove that the painting of a nude woman reclining on a bed , known as ' odalisque ' , is by an unknown artist			2
real or fake : @entity10 believes the painting ' odalisque ' , by @entity13 and sold to him by @entity5 , is by another artist but @entity5 's are standing firmly by the attribution they made before the sale and are calling on their own eminent team of experts to establish the painting as an authentic @entity13			1
the battle to prove the the providence of the painting will last 19 days , and centre around a tiny signature in cyrillic script - said to be that of @entity13 and dated 1919			1
64th richest man : @entity10 also collects fabergé eggs @entity43 , for @entity44 , through which the painting was purchased , said careful analysis of the signature showed it ' running over ' existing cracks in the paint and indicated that it was not written until the late 1940s			1
also highlighting the use of an aluminium - based pigment on the canvas , the @entity50 said it was of a type which was not commonly used by artists until after @entity13 's death			1
' @entity58 ' was returned to @entity5 's after doubts about its authenticity were raised after the sale			1
the painting was placed on an easel in court for mr @entity65 to view			0
however , the case began with a dispute over which side should have physical custody of the painting , which @entity72 's legal team wants to subject to further tests			2
mr @entity74 said microscopic , extremely high resolution , photography of the signature could prove conclusively whether it was appended in 1919 or ' considerably later '			0
the famous auction house @entity5 's stand by their original research into the painting he added that , if a ' cross-sectional test ' of the signature showed a layer of dust between it and the pigment beneath , that would also support @entity72 's case			2
@entity91 , for @entity5 , did not object to fresh photographs being taken , but said cross-sectional testing would be ' unethical ' and ' extraordinarily invasive ' , given the very small size of the signature			0
through a detailed comparison between ' odalisque ' and authenticated works by @entity13 , @entity5 insists that the technique , subject matter and other similarities support the attribution to the @entity14 master			2
they also say the @entity104 - based pigment identified in the painting was in use by artists in 1919 , although not as commonly as in the 1930s			0
the @entity8 hearing - the legal costs of which are likely to equal - if not exceed - the sum paid for the painting seven years ago , continues			1
self - portrait : @entity13 in 1912 @entity13 was born in 1878 in @entity115 is southern @entity14			0
he lost his father at an early age , forcing his family to move into a rich merchant 's house , which he said would inspire his paintings for the rest of his life			0
he moved in stage - set design and book illustrating , and then gained a name for himself as a painter , in particular for his portraits			0
@entity13 moved to @entity129 and entered the @entity130 , becoming a student of the artist @entity132			2
his paintings and satirical drawings of the aftermath of the @entity136 are often seen as a symbol of @entity14 in the 1920s			0
sadly , tuberculosis of the spine took a toll on him , eventually leaving his legs paralysed , but despite this he continued to paint up - beat paintings about his beloved homeland .			0

oil tycoon @entity10 believes ' @entity58 ' is a fake
cracks under artist 's signature ' show it was signed 20 years after @entity13 's death '
@entity8 hearing lasting 19 days is likely to cost more than the value of the painting
