the 30 - year - old , of @entity86 , @entity87 , said : ' i was ecstatic that i got to witness this phenomenon , as it is very rare and not something you 'd see every day			0
' i woke up early on this particular day to go on a morning walk through a meadow when i spotted the special moment			0
' he added : ' the frog did n't seem to react at all , it just kept quiet and let the butterfly move around and get into a comfortable position on its head , and then they just sat there together			2
' mr @entity79 watched as the butterfly perched on the head of the frog for around three minutes , before flying away			2
line - up : this time , the frogs form an orderly queue on the branch			0
they are classed as a near threatened species by the @entity55 go away : the frogs turn their back on the 25 - year - old photographer , who spotted them near his home in @entity18 , @entity19 green and yellow : they can be either light green or dark green in colour and they have black spots around their backs and heads the blue pansy butterfly was lucky to leave in one piece as the diet of a green tree frog , otherwise known as a dumpy frog , consists mainly of insects and spiders			1

a green tree frog can grow up to 10cm in length , and is native to northern and eastern regions of @entity141 and to southern @entity142 mr @entity79 added : ' when people see these photographs they usually laugh , i 've had a few comments from people saying the frog looks like it 's wearing a little bow			1
' i was originally only out looking to photograph frogs , but to my surprise the little butterfly hopped on this unsuspecting frog			2
' i let the butterfly move freely , and the frog did not seem bothered by the presence of butterfly at all			2
