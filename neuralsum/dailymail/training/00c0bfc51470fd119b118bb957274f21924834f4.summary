by @entity0 this is the dramatic moment that a young woman who said she was going to kill herself after a row with her family almost ended up carrying out the threat when she slipped off the balcony , and ended up hanging 11 floors above the street			1
@entity9 , 23 , tried to kill herself by hanging out of a window in @entity12 city in southwest @entity15 's @entity14 province			1
the drama started when she was heard having a furious row with her family and shouted that she 'd had enough and was going to end it all			1
but after she climbed onto the balcony in a dramatic gesture the young woman slipped			1
according to neighbour @entity33 , living on the 11th floor and just below the family of the young woman , he had heard shouting that seemed to be from the balcony above , and had gone out to look			2
he said : ' i could n't believe it , she had clearly slipped from the balcony above but had somehow managed to either grab onto my guardrail or had got her feet stuck			2
hanging by a thread : she is pictured being held tightly by rescuers after she tried to kill herself ' either way she was hanging upside down by her feet and threatened to slip onto the street below at any moment			0
i grabbed hold of her feet and held on			0
' @entity46 were quickly on the scene and were able to reach the young woman by clambering over the front of the balconies , and then helping her back up to the flat she had fallen from because there was a metal grill over mr @entity33 's flat that prevented entry			0
the dramatic scenes of the last moment of the rescue were snapped by a person on the street below who uploaded them onto social media sites where the fireman won praise for his bravery in clambering out of the window , despite the risk to his own life			0
safety : luckily , rescuers hauled @entity9 to safety and dragged her inside			0

@entity73 , 23 was *overheard* rowing with her family in @entity15
she told them that she 'd had enough and *wanted* to end it all
her family did not believe her and went back to watching tv
soon the 23 **-** year **-** old was hanging over their balcony and slipped
she was later rescued by firefighters who hoisted her back to safety
