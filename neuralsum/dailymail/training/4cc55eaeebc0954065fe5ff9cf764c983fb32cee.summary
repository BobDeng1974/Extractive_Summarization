who 's next on the @entity2 conveyor belt of world - class superstar heroes ? in the absence of major trophies , a forceful section of @entity5 are taking it upon themselves to thrust forward a certain player as a world - class star who ’s better than everyone else on the planet			1
the tell - tale signs of this condition are as follows : gooners go on social media to over-praise a certain player , selectively use statistics which support their point , and avoid at all costs a degree of measured judgement			0
the @entity2 player should be compared favourably with all others , especially if they play for @entity24 , @entity25 or @entity26			2
@entity2 manager @entity27 pictured during their @entity28 win over @entity30 at the weekend @entity31 cost £ 42million and created plenty of hype when he arrived at the @entity34 from the @entity35 @entity36 international @entity31 left @entity24 and they won the @entity37 as @entity2 won the @entity28 @entity38 are shovelling money into @entity41 's bank account for nothing @entity43 requires a superhuman effort to restore past glories to @entity46 @entity47 are on the verge but @entity50 's lack of empathy for fans holds them back guide to how much you hate @entity53 : think @entity54 dived ? obsessed with @entity56 ? think @entity58 's goal should not have stood ? you hate @entity53 the focus is on whoever ’s playing well for @entity2 at the time , and the aim is to convince anyone gullible enough to take this nonsense seriously that @entity2 are still a serious force at the top level of the beautiful game			1
at the start of last season it was @entity31			0
he cost £ 42million so he must be good , right ? that all went a bit quiet when everyone quickly worked out the reasons why @entity24 were happy to let him go			1
without him they won the @entity37 , with him @entity2 lifted the @entity28			0
@entity31 was swiftly shifted into the shade and @entity81 was paraded as the new world - class star			1
it seemed like only a few weeks had passed since @entity2 fans were united in their desire for the @entity87 international to be moved on			2
yet @entity5 would have us believe he was the best midfielder in @entity90 , the best welshman on the planet - his @entity28 final goal was surely better than @entity96 ’s @entity95 final effort , they claimed			0
@entity2 's @entity81 was hailed as the new world - class star at the @entity34 after @entity31 gooners would have us believe @entity81 was the best midfielder in @entity90 but he has proved otherwise this season it was @entity100			1
then he felt a bit tired , so @entity102 was the next shiny superstar			1
just the kind of player @entity2 needed ( probably why he was sent to @entity105 until there was an injury crisis )			0
did i just hear someone compare him to @entity111 ? next they ’ll be claiming he ’s better than @entity114 and @entity115 put together			0
the over-hype of @entity102 embarrassed a few gooners who understandably felt the need to inject some realism into the matter			0
so now the spotlight is on @entity122			2
he ’s the new @entity2 love - interest			2
stats are being passed around showing he ’s got more assists that @entity127 and @entity128			2
but how many managers would sign @entity122 over @entity127 or @entity128 ? i ’d wager very few , although there ’s no doubt he ’s been playing well			1
so well that it ’s been reported @entity135 are keen to sign him			0
@entity102 ( left ) became the next superstar tipped to lead on from @entity2 legend @entity111 the spotlight is now on @entity122 - billed as the @entity2 hero who will lead them to trophies @entity122 has become the latest to get @entity2 fans excited with his performances at the @entity34 so who will it be next ? there was a brief flurry of love for @entity148 after his goal against @entity46			1
and then his bang average performance in the defeat by @entity152 calmed all that down			0
@entity155 ’s clean sheet stat - until that pain at the @entity157 - had him promoted to @entity159 status among the @entity34 faithful for a short time			0
per @entity162 won the @entity163 so he must be world class , right ? unfortunately for the big @entity171 , his mate @entity166 , and a whole host of footballers from @entity170 past , it does n’t work like that			2
so what ’s the big idea ? what has made @entity2 fans come out with all this nonsense ? @entity148 ( centre ) recently caused a stir , pictured here with @entity181 ( left ) and @entity122 @entity155 ( left ) - until that pain at @entity157 - had been hailed as up there with @entity159 it ’s this : they do n’t win big trophies , so in order to try to keep themselves in the picture towards the top of the table , and keep up the image of a big club still up there with the big boys , they have to over-promote their players on a rotation basis beyond their true abilities			1
if these players really are as good as @entity2 fans want us to believe , the @entity199 would be top of the @entity204 table and favourites to win the @entity37			1
but they ’re not .			0

@entity31 cost £ 42million and was billed as @entity2 's world - class star
@entity81 was next big thing before attention went to @entity100
@entity102 was also supposed to be the next shiny superstar
the spotlight has turned to @entity216 *playmaker* @entity122
but few managers would sign him over @entity127 or @entity128
@entity2 fans keep themselves in the picture by over-promoting players
