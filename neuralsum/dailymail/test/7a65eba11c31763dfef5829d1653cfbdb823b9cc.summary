eating out just once a week raises your risk of suffering from high blood pressure			1
those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension – elevated blood pressure – with just one extra meal out a week raising the odds by six per cent , a study found			1
eating out is associated with higher calorie , saturated fat and salt intake – all causes of high blood pressure			1
stock photo a team at @entity22 in @entity23 found 27.4 per cent of the population suffered from pre-hypertension			1
of these , 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals out per week , the @entity26 reported			1
professor @entity28 , of @entity29 ( @entity22 ) , designed and supervised a study to find behaviour associated with hypertension in a young adult population in @entity34			0
her team surveyed 501 university students , aged 18 to 40 , in @entity23			0
figures on blood pressure , body mass index ( @entity40 ) and lifestyle , including meals eaten away from home and physical activity levels , were collected			2
the association with hypertension was then determined			0
researchers in @entity23 found those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension			2
stock photo using statistical analysis , the researchers found that pre-hypertension was found in 27.4 per cent of the total population , and 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals away from home per week ; while the gender breakdown showed that pre-hypertension was much more prevalent in men ( 49 per cent ) than in women ( nine per cent )			1
the findings showed those who had pre-hypertension or hypertension were more likely to eat more meals away from home per week , have a higher mean @entity40 , have lower mean physical activity levels , and be current smokers			2
the novel finding of the study , published online by the @entity26 , was the link that dr. @entity71 's team was able to show between pre-hypertension and hypertension with meals eaten away from home			0
the researchers said that what was also significant was that even eating one extra meal out , raised the odds of pre-hypertension by six per cent			0
dr @entity71 said : ' while there have been studies conducted in the @entity83 and @entity84 to find behaviours associated with hypertension , very few have surveyed a @entity34 population			0
' our research plugs that gap and highlights lifestyle factors associated with pre-hypertension and hypertension that are potentially modifiable , and would be applicable to young adults globally , especially those of @entity34 descent			0
' she said future studies should examine the effect of lifestyle modification programmes on blood pressure levels of at - risk people .			2
