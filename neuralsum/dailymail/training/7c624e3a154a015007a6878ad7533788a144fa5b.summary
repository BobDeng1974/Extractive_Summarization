@entity0 - under scrutiny for her pricey contract with @entity3 - has n't been featured since january , but the network says it does expect two completed stories to air soon , and two others are in the works			1
@entity10 and @entity9 's daughter , who was hired in 2011 , has done just a smattering of reporting for @entity3			2
last week , @entity12 reported she is being paid $ 600,000 a year			0
@entity12 also said the 34 - year - old , who is expecting her first child later this year , is now on a month - to - month contract that would ease her departure should her mother decide to run for president in 2016			1
while it is not uncommon for well - known anchors to earn multiple millions per year , but @entity22 's reported annual salary is high for the frequency of her segments			1
all grown up : @entity27 's wealth has allowed her to regularly dye her hair blonde and blow out her naturally frizzy hair in the spotlight : the work of @entity10 and @entity9 's daughter , who was hired in 2011 , has attracted interest after it emerged @entity3 is paying her $ 600,000 a year by comparison , her salary is higher than both of the last two editors of the @entity39			1
the paycheck inevitably helped @entity27 , 34 , and her husband when they bought a $ 10.5million apartment next to @entity44 's @entity43 last spring			1
it is not clear how much fellow first daughter @entity46 , who is a @entity47 correspondent , makes as part of her contract			0
the news division has so far refused to reveal publicly any information about @entity22 's contract or her work			1
a @entity22 spokesman , @entity55 , referred questions to @entity3			2
earning her keep : @entity27 switched from an annual to a month - to - month contract earlier this year ( pictured with her mother watching over her at a function n @entity44 on thursday ) @entity3 has aired two stories by @entity0 so far in 2014 , both on education programs targeting the underprivileged that were shown on @entity65 in january			1
@entity3 indicated , however , that @entity22 has done two stories that are expected to air on @entity65 shortly and two others for which filming has been scheduled			2
@entity22 is also busier with outside work , reportedly taking a more active role in her parents ' foundation , and @entity3 wanted to avoid the appearance of a conflict by having her on the air around the time @entity9 was doing a round of media interviews about her new book			1
@entity22 began work at the network in november 2011			1
she was the second presidential daughter to get work at @entity3 ; @entity46 , daughter of @entity85 , is a today show correspondent			1
besides @entity65 , @entity22 was hired to do stories for @entity89 ' @entity88 newsmagazine , which has since been canceled			1
@entity22 profiled designer @entity90 and author @entity91 for @entity88 and also did a cringeworthy voiceover interview with the @entity94 gecko			2
much of her work falls under the umbrella of @entity3 's making a difference stories , about various efforts to make communities better			2
@entity100 pay up : @entity0 started working for @entity3 in 2011 and making segments for the now - defunct @entity88 with @entity89 ( pictured ) but her most recent contribution aired in january she 's done stories on the @entity104 , a school program for jailed teenagers ; a restaurant chain that donates leftover food to the needy ; a @entity111 school program where teachers at public and charter schools swap ideas ; and an @entity116 tutoring program			1
her @entity65 stories this year were about a ' homework diner ' in @entity119 that feeds free meals to schoolchildren and their families , and a boxing gym in @entity124 where youngsters must prove they 've done their schoolwork to put on the gloves			0
' she has a niche on the ' @entity65 ' profiling philanthropic , volunteer and community service programs , often in praise of these groups , ' news consultant @entity134 , who monitors the content of network evening news programs , said wednesday			0
' she puts herself in the center of these groups ' activities			0
it 's a cheerleader style of reporting			0
' @entity85 's daughter seems genuinely interested in being a television journalist , while that does n't appear to be the case with @entity22 , @entity134 said			2
@entity146 interviewed president @entity147 about fatherhood for a today story that aired earlier this month , and @entity150 this winter about the first lady 's healthy living initiatives			2
she 's also interviewed @entity154 and reported on school curriculum efforts recently			0
luxury look : @entity27 wore leather pants , a @entity159 necklace and @entity160 heels to an event two thursdays ago for a news division , an unspoken advantage to having a presidential relative on the payroll might be help in getting access to their famous family in newsworthy situations			0
@entity85 gave his first television interview since leaving the @entity172 to the @entity47 's @entity173 in 2010			0
@entity174 also interviewed her father about his paintings for today in april			0
meanwhile , @entity9 's first television interview on her new book went to @entity179 of @entity180			0
paying the mortgage : @entity27 and her husband @entity182 bought this four bedroom apartment overlooking @entity43 in @entity184 for $ 10.5million last spring the @entity3 paycheck is just part of her take - home pay , however , since she has been spending most of her time working for her family 's eponymous foundation			1
her mother 's expected presidential run is not the only factor that could weigh into her contractual switch from year to month since she is expecting her first child this fall			1
she has not discussed what she plans to do when the baby is born and whether or not she will return to @entity3 as a mom			0
the furor over @entity22 's salary comes just days after her mother 's book was released , and during an interview with @entity180 's @entity179 she said that the family struggled financially after leaving the @entity172 in 2001			2
' we came out of the @entity172 not only dead broke but in debt			0
we had no money when we got there , and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses , for @entity27 â€™s education			0
you know , it was not easy , ' she said .			0
