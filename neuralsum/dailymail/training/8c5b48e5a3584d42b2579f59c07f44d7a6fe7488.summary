@entity140 said her son was a ' daddy 's boy ' and could not have carried out the killings far from a quiet life of tending cattle , they claimed @entity6 had been give control of the cartel following their deaths			1
but ms @entity140 claimed her son was just a simple , hard - working farmer and said she refused to believe that he could be responsible for the young women 's murders			1
' it 's not just because i 'm his mother , but he is a sweetie and i miss him , ' she said			2

he 'd come home with fruit or food he knew i liked , just so i knew he had thought about me			0
' he worried about me and always reminded me to take my medicines for my nerves and high blood pressure			0

if he remains a prisoner , i do n't know what i 'm going to do			0
' back at the @entity18 jail , prison director @entity267 claimed @entity6 ' protests of innocence will not convince a judge or jury to set him free			1
' of course he 's not going to testify against himself			2
@entity6 is a dangerous narcotrafficker and the whole town is frightened of him			1
everyone knows what he is capable of , ' he said			0
