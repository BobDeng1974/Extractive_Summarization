’ mr @entity0 , former leader of the @entity1 , wants to detail in court one of the most shameful episodes for @entity5 intelligence this century			1
he says that in march 2004 – the same month @entity52 did his ‘ deal in the desert ’ with @entity14 – @entity5 intelligence helped the @entity9 arrange his rendition alongside his wife to @entity57 after they sought asylum in @entity60			1
he says he was blindfolded and beaten in a ‘ black prison ’ in @entity62 while his wife was chained to a wall			1
once in @entity7 , he says he was tortured during six horrific years in jails including @entity66 and @entity67			1
days after @entity14 was overthrown in @entity57 , i found documents detailing startling collusion between @entity5 , the @entity9 and @entity7 in the destroyed residence of the @entity5 ambassador			2
these included a series of questions sent by @entity5 spies for @entity14 ’s security forces to ask @entity0			2
another letter found elsewhere revealed sir @entity79 , then head of @entity11 ’s counter-terrorism division , taking credit for capturing the couple			0

‘ i consider this to be an issue of dignity that can not be settled with money , ’ said mr @entity0			1

‘ when they refused i wanted the judicial system to cast light on what happened to us			0
’ the @entity116 rejected government attempts to quash the case in october			0
despite spending almost £ 400,000 of taxpayers ’ cash already , ministers are expected to make one final attempt at the @entity123 next year			0
@entity125 officials claim @entity5 relations with the @entity9 could be damaged by the case – a spurious argument designed to shield their involvement in unethical practices and destroyed by the depth of revelations in the @entity24 report			2

‘ on the contrary i have a great deal of appreciation and thanks to the @entity5 people for standing with us after the @entity7 revolution … and helping us end the tyrannical rule of @entity14			2
' all i ask for is justice			0
it is up to the @entity5 judicial system to decide who was responsible and to hold them to account			0

‘ i would like my case to be a window for the @entity5 judiciary and public to see what was done in their name so that we can end such abuses in the future			2
