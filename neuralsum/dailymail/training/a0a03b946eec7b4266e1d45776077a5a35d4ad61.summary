by @entity0 photographs dating back to as early as 1970 of astronauts training on a barren @entity4 island in preparation for their historic missions to the moon were released by @entity9 on saturday			1
the photos show the crews of @entity12 , 15 and 17 training on @entity14 's @entity14 , a volcanic landscape which sports an environment remarkably similar to the one found on the moon			1
the astronauts practiced with equipment such as the moon buggy in area with recent volcanic activity , also rehearsing activities such as taking soil samples			1
the earliest photograph dates back to 1970 , which shows astronauts @entity25 , @entity27 and @entity28 of @entity12 training with a @entity30			1
this image from 1970 shows @entity32 14 astronauts @entity25 , @entity34 , and @entity28 training with a @entity36 along with another unidentified individual			0
this photo was among a set recently unearthed by @entity9 showing astronauts training in preparation for their historic moon missions			1
this photo , taken in 1971 , shows apollo 17 astronaut @entity44 ( pictured left ) training in a lunar roving vehicle on the @entity14 of @entity14			1
@entity32 17 , which launched on december 7 , 1972 , was the last manned lunar mission undertaken by the @entity48 , making this photo the latest in the set recently unearthed by @entity9			0
according to @entity9 , the photographs were found by @entity51 , executive director of @entity52 , a @entity14 state agency			0
@entity51 reportedly found the photos while visiting the @entity54 , in @entity55 , @entity56			0
@entity51 said that crews from @entity32 missions 13 through 17 trained on the island for their lunar missions			1
the island is still used by @entity9 to test robots for missions to the moon and to @entity64			2
this picture , dated december 1970 , shows members of the crew of @entity69 training with gear on			0
the area was picked for it 's remarkable similarity to the terrain of the moon			2
@entity32 15 members @entity74 ( pictured left ) and @entity76 ( pictured right ) digging soil on the @entity14 in december 1970			2
according to @entity51 , robots are being tested on ' lava tubes ' , areas formed after lava solidifies and becomes a solid sheet			0
formations similar to lava tubes have been found on satellite imaging of planets such as @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity64			0
in recent years , @entity9 has also begun to use the island to test new technology that can pull oxygen out of the area 's dirt , which is volcanic basalt much like the soil commonly found on both the moon and @entity64			1
the technology could allow future missions to simply extract oxygen from the planet 's soil instead of bringing it on the trip			2
the technology could also be applied to make fuel for the missions .			0

never *-* before seen photos show crews of @entity12 , 15 , and 17 lunar missions training in conditions similar to the moon
training took place on @entity14 's @entity14 , a volcanic area in the *archipelago*
area now used for testing robots and new technology for *upcoming* space missions
