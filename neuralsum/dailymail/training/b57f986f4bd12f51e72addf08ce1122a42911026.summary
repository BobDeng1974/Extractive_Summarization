secretary of defense @entity0 announced today that he had approved a recommendation from a top general to quarantine all soldiers returning from ebola - afflicted countries for 21 days in @entity6 before allowing them to return to the @entity7 acting on behalf of the heads of all the armed services divisions of the military , @entity13 gen. @entity12 , chairman of the @entity14 , on tuesday asked @entity15 to instate the quarantine rules			1
the @entity13 , acting on its own authority , had already announced a mandatory quarantine for its soldiers at a base near @entity22 , @entity23			1
the move has sparked intense outrage from @entity23 officials			1
' they should n't have been sent here , they should do their quarantine for @entity33 at home , ' the president of the region 's assembly , @entity27 , said according to a local news report			1
' major general @entity46 , the commander of the @entity7 military operation in @entity48 placed himself and 11 members of his staff in isolation at the @entity52 , @entity23 base earlier this week			1
none of the military personnel are showing symptoms of @entity33 , the news report said , but the hospital there has set aside a special wing with five beds just in case any of them do			2
@entity15 said today at a conference in @entity64 that all service divisions of the military will now have to abide by a similar quarantine			1
the @entity69 chief said wednesday that it had approved the request after the families and communities of the roughly 1,000 service members working in @entity48 and @entity75 voiced concerns about the possibility of an @entity33 outbreak			1
' the fact is the military will have more @entity7 in @entity48 than any other department , ' @entity15 said , today during an on - stage interview at the @entity83 , an annual event hosted by the @entity85 and the @entity86			1
' our people are younger , the cohorts are different , they are not volunteers , ' he continued			0
@entity15 said that the need for a new policy ' was discussed in great detail by the communities , by the families of our military men and women , and they very much wanted a safety valve on this			1
' the defense secretary also disclosed to the audience that he ordered the @entity14 to provide him with a blueprint of how the quarantine will be implemented within the next 15 days and a progress report after 45 days have passed			2
@entity69 spokesman rear adm. @entity106 said in a statement that the ' review will offer a recommendation on whether or not such controlled monitoring should continue based on what we learn and observe from the initial waves of personnel returning from @entity115			2
' @entity106 noted that @entity15 felt the quarantine was necessary given the large number of troops in @entity6 who are aiding @entity33 health workers and the ' unique logistical demands and impact this deployment has on the force			1
' the secretary 's highest priority is the safety and security of our men and women in uniform and their families , ' @entity15 's spokesman said			1
the @entity69 's announcement today was not unexpected			2
the @entity136 confirmed yesterday that @entity69 was considering an service - wide quarantine			1
president @entity139 also acknowledged the probable policy shift on tuesday			2
after the @entity139 gave reporters a brief update on the administration 's efforts to slow down the rate of @entity33 infections in @entity6 , he took a single question from the press			2
the reporter asked @entity139 if he was concerned there might be ' confusion ' about why states are introducing different quarantine rules than the federal government			1
' well , the military is a different situation , obviously , because they are , first of all , not treating patients , ' @entity139 said , whereas health workers being put into quarantine once they arrive in the @entity7 do have direct contact with @entity33 patients			2
' second of all , they are not there voluntarily , it ’s part of their mission that 's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me , the commander - in - chief , ' he asserted			0
' so we do n't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians			0
they are already , by definition , if they 're in the military , under more circumscribed conditions			0
' members of the @entity69 's @entity183 dress with protective gear during a training seminar at @entity186 last week			2
states have introduced policies requiring the at - home monitoring of medical professionals who 've recently traveled to ebola - stricken countries			0
the military will require their personnel to undergo mandatory quarantines in @entity6 @entity136 press secretary @entity196 gave a similar explanation to reporters at his daily briefing on tuesday			0
' i do n’t think it ’s a particular surprise to anybody who understands that it ’s not uncommon for the policy that ’s implemented for civilians to be different than the policy that ’s implemented for our military service personnel , ' he said			0
' that ’s not unusual			0
' @entity196 also pointed out that policies requiring the at - home monitoring of medical professionals returning from @entity6 are different because ' we ’re talking about a couple of dozen health care workers a week ' coming back			0
' ' when we ’re talking about military personnel , we ’re talking about thousands of military service members who have been or will be deployed to @entity6 to carry out the mission that the president ordered , ' the @entity136 spokesman said			1
' and in order to monitor their health , it simply is easier to do that if their movements are restricted and they ’re all co-located , ' he stressed			0
@entity196 told reporters that it 's important to keep in mind that that the quarantine is not that dissimilar from the other ' kinds of sacrifices that our military service members make on a daily basis			1
' ' there are a wide range of sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make for the sake of efficiency and for the sake of uniformity and for the success of our military , ' he said , and this is just one of them			0
the @entity139 aide also reasserted the administration 's position that mandatory quarantines for civilians not showing symptoms of @entity33 are undesirable and over the top			2
' implementing this military policy in a civilian context would only have the effect of hindering our @entity33 response by dissuading civilian doctors and nurses from traveling to @entity6 to stop the outbreak in its tracks , ' he said			2
' the only way that we can entirely eliminate the @entity33 risk to the @entity7 people is to stop this outbreak in its tracks in @entity6			0
' @entity15 , left , told national correspondent of the @entity86 @entity274 said that the need for a new quarantine policy ' was discussed in great detail by the communities , by the families of our military men and women , and they very much wanted a safety valve on this			1
' the conversation took place at the @entity83 , hosted by @entity85 and the @entity86 , in @entity64 at wednesday 's invite - only gathering in @entity64 of top government and business leaders , @entity15 also gave an assessment of the military 's efforts to eliminate @entity293 in @entity294 and @entity295			1
as the @entity139 administration and military leaders have said time and time again , defeating @entity293 ' will require a steady , long - term effort , ' @entity15 said			1
later he professed , ' i think we 're in for a longer term challenge here , ' maybe more than ' any of us ' had hoped			1
' but that 's the world that we live in , ' he added			0
' we 've got a monster out there			0
and we got ta be smart about it			0
' @entity15 warned that ' each one of these issues ' involving @entity7 security ' regardless of where they are affects us now and will continue to affect us in the future			0
' and meeting them will require a partnership between the military and @entity317 , he said , because @entity317 the government 's finances			0
' so we need them , ' he said			0
' we ca n't do this any other way			0
' the upcoming midterm elections will hopefully ' self correct ' the gridlock in @entity317 and allow for a closer partnership between the administration and lawmakers , the @entity69 chief said .			0

army gen. @entity12 , chairman of the @entity14 , on tuesday asked @entity15 to instate the quarantine rules
the @entity13 , acting on its own authority , had already mandated the quarantine for its soldiers in @entity23
local @entity23 officials are not happy about the policy : ' they should n't have been sent here , they should do their quarantine for @entity33 at home '
@entity15 said the families of service members as well as their communities ' very much wanted a safety valve on this '
the @entity69 head made the announcement at an invite - only gathering in @entity64 of top government and business leaders
speaking later about @entity293 , @entity15 said : ' i think we 're in for a longer term challenge here , ' maybe more than ' any of us ' had hoped
