by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 did n't choose the year he was born			1
he did n’t choose his precise place of birth			0
he did n’t choose the country , either			2
in the grand scheme of things , none of that matters a bean			0
all that counts is that the @entity12 winger is freely allowed to choose whichever country he wants to represent			1
it should be his democratic right to attach himself to the country of his choice			2
instead , what we have at the moment is a 19 - year - old kid being pushed and pulled in every direction by every international team with half a chance of nicking him for their senior side			1
welcome home : @entity1 arrives back in @entity14 from @entity34 on tuesday after @entity12 's warm - weather break ( left ) , during which he was pictured posing with the legendary @entity36 ( right ) catch him if you can : @entity1 in action for @entity12 during their draw against @entity41 earlier this month take @entity14			1
‘ we ’re still in dialogue with @entity50 , ’ was the measured response from one of @entity45 ’s aides when @entity14 ’s head coach was asked for an update on @entity1 ’s naturalisation			1
seriously , you would have thought we were dealing with a hostage crisis , not the international aspirations of a @entity12 substitute			1
there is a certain amount of sympathy for the predicament @entity45 finds himself in , even if he did direct a yorker at the feet of the @entity63 board			0
he wants a policy decision from the @entity63 on this sensitive situation , something that may well come long after @entity45 has departed as @entity14 ’s head coach			2
judging from the political noises in @entity15 , there are no such difficulties as they prepare to play their first international friendly , against @entity71 , next month			1
explosive entrance : the 19 - year - old burst onto the scene with a double strike at @entity76 last year headache : the @entity12 winger is wanted by @entity14 but has several international options waiting for the call : @entity14 boss @entity45 is a confirmed admirer of the talented youngster the tie is an emotional one , with @entity1 ’s family involvement in the country ’s bloody battle for independence in the nineties a key factor in their attempts to secure him			1
these are noble and honourable arguments , but a gruesome war , with its origins centuries old , should not influence his final decision			0
then there is @entity16 , where @entity1 was born on february 5 , 1995			1
on the basis of his birthplace , @entity98 , the country ’s international manager , has the greatest claim of all			2
which brings us to the ‘ @entity110 is @entity110 ’ debate , a phrase coined by @entity108 when he was talking about @entity109 in 2008			0
in @entity112 , written by the @entity63 ’s former director of public affairs , it is claimed @entity115 wanted @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , @entity118 , @entity119 ( both @entity120 ) and @entity121 ( @entity122 ) to represent the @entity14 national team			1
@entity108 was vehemently opposed to @entity116 ’s selection , arguing the case for young , emerging @entity110 goalkeepers			0
back in 2008 , @entity127 made it known he would consider @entity109 , a @entity129 national , if he acquired a @entity131 passport			0
@entity14 ’s @entity117 - born manager did not want to push it publicly or privately , but he would have been considered for selection if he had become a naturalised citizen			1
boy wonder : an even younger @entity1 holding trophies during a school tournament in @entity16 if the shirt fits ... @entity1 ( back left in @entity140 kit ) poses for a team picture at @entity143 school it was met with generational resistance , something @entity108 , then @entity14 ’s goalkeeping coach , spoke about at the time			1
‘ i am all for @entity110 goalkeepers in the @entity14 team , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s as simple as that			0
’ except it is n’t any more , is it ? taken in its purest form , this awkward phrase would mean discrimination at every turn			0
people would want proof that every @entity110 had been born to the strains of @entity162 in the delivery room			0
take @entity164 as an example			0
ask 10 people around you where @entity168 is on the map and the majority of them will struggle to stick a pin in right place			0
but it does n’t matter because @entity164 , who was born in the @entity177 - @entity176 , @entity168 , in fact - went on to play 36 times for @entity14			1
before he chose @entity14 , presumably because he was playing in this country at the time with @entity181 , he was also eligible to play for @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			1
@entity186 , a member of @entity14 ’s @entity188 squad , was born in @entity189 , @entity190			2
he qualified for a @entity131 passport under residency rules and opted to play for @entity14			2
@entity186 ’s father is @entity117 , his mother @entity190			0
that is an example of the @entity1 principle and anyone who was around the @entity14 team at the time of @entity186 ’s change of nationality will tell you that they did n’t bat an eyelid			1
not born in @entity14 : @entity206 left - backs @entity164 ( left ) and @entity186 ( right ) ultimate prize : @entity208 ( right ) kisses the @entity188 in 1998 alongside @entity209 ( centre ) still patriots : @entity212 and @entity208 were both born outside @entity185 but played for @entity213 @entity217 to other countries , little @entity214 , born in @entity215 in 1968 , went on to lift the @entity188 30 years later with @entity185			1
by then he had changed his name to @entity208 and was widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished central defenders in the history of the game			2
look at the pictures of @entity208 , sent off with 10 minutes left to play in the @entity185 , celebrating with his team - mates at the final whistle			1
@entity212 , the right - back , was born in @entity227			2
@entity228 was born in @entity229			0
substitute @entity230 was born in @entity231			0
over in @entity129 , the success story at @entity233 began with @entity234 , born in @entity235 , @entity122 , lifting the trophy after @entity237 scored the winner in the final			0
@entity234 , who made 28 appearances for his adopted country , was the 40th naturalised player in @entity129 ’s history			0
in terms of international football , the lines are blurred by the increase in travel and the desire to experience life in other countries			0
if @entity1 chooses to play for @entity14 , we may never discover the reasons why			1
then again , it should n’t matter .			0

@entity12 forward @entity1 is being coveted by @entity14
the 19 - year - old can also play for @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 or @entity18
just because star was born in @entity16 does not mean he has to play for that national side
@entity208 is just one example of many stars born outside the country they played for at international level
