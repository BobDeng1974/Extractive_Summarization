@entity0 was positively brimming with bouquets			0
he praised his resolute defenders , he celebrated his strikers , he paid particular tribute to the brilliance of @entity6 , @entity8 ’s most influential contributor			1
but , in the wake of a genuinely momentous victory , he could not refrain from stealing a modest moment at centre stage			0
the cue was a suggestion that he might feel vindicated by the recent performances of his team , following the critical bruisings he had suffered last season			0
he started to mutter about the dangers of looking back , of dwelling on the past			2
then he burst out : ‘ it ’s well documented : i ’m still here ! ’ in fairness , only the meanest curmudgeon would deny the manager his satisfaction			0
if @entity8 had found an available replacement , then @entity0 would surely have been on his way last spring			1

@entity0 spoke of ‘ a terrific performance ’ and ‘ a massive , massive victory ’			0
as a consequence of a full - hearted , soundly - organised effort , the title ambitions of @entity104 have moved into sharper focus			0
as a further consequence , the continued tenure of @entity64 ’s @entity85 is coming into question			1
the @entity111 denied feeling under any pressure , but since he also asserted that his team had deserved to win this absorbing match , his judgment may not be entirely reliable			0
for @entity64 are currently playing like strangers to their real form			1
a side which once reeked of class , now reeks of something like passive complacency , a malady best demonstrated by the man who was once their most devastating player			0
until the team finally found itself , deep in the second half , @entity73 had performed like a weary irrelevance			2
his impact was minimal , his contribution belying the talent which had once made him one of the @entity133 game ’s most illustrious imports			0
just as @entity6 toiled and sweated for the midfield control he enjoyed , so @entity73 seemed reluctant to join the battle			0
with @entity75 untypically missing chances galore , with @entity67 suffering a merciless chasing from @entity8 ’s front men , and with @entity66 not only equally ineffective but hugely fortunate to remain on the field after a string of frustrated lunges , the wonder was that @entity64 remained in the argument for so long			1
goals from @entity52 and @entity28 had carried @entity8 clear and , despite a fine retaliation from the admirable @entity74 late on , @entity64 never did enough to state a plausible case			1
they were left to curse a number of squandered opportunities , but they had done little to deserve equality			0
their rally had arrived too late and carried too little conviction			0
they began with a degree of optimism			0
@entity75 , running from half way , battered a drive which caught a deflection and saw @entity45 scrambling at the foot of a post			2
then @entity74 struck a free kick a foot over from 22 yards			1
and that was about as good as it got for @entity64 in the first half			1
as @entity6 assumed total midfield control and the front runners @entity52 and @entity167 began to persecute @entity64 ’s centre - backs , the champions were reduced to hopeful retaliation on the break			1
a @entity8 success seemed inevitable , and it came in the 21st minute			1
song slid a pass down the right , @entity54 sprinted on , reached the byline and pulled back an inviting cross			1
the ball evaded @entity65 , and @entity52 was awarded the simplest tap - in			1
it was no more than @entity8 ’s control had deserved			1
@entity74 scores for @entity64 to make it 2 - 1 but it was not enough to take anything from the game @entity74 celebrates his goal with captain @entity66 as the @entity188 midfielder halved the deficit @entity52 scores to put @entity8 1 - 0 up and celebrates his goal with team - mate @entity191 @entity52 ( center ) scores past @entity64 's goalkeeper @entity33 to give @entity8 the lead at @entity93 @entity33 looks back helplessly as the ball crosses the line from @entity52 's shot @entity52 ( right ) celebrates his goal in the first half that put @entity8 1 - 0 up @entity6 put in a commanding performance for @entity8 as they beat @entity64 song 's heat map shows he got around the middle of the pitch and was busy throughout the game song plays a ' rabona ' pass in the penalty area during @entity8 's win song salutes the @entity8 fans after the win in a game in which he was named man of the match @entity75 speaks to referee @entity87 as the @entity64 striker had a frustrating afternoon at @entity93 @entity75 was lucky to stay on the pitch after this over the top challenge on @entity51 @entity219 miles @entity8 109.2 67.9 @entity51 90 12.2 7.6 @entity220 90 11.0 6.9 @entity191 90 10.7 6.7 @entity64 104.8 65.2 @entity221 90 11.1 6.9 @entity74 90 10.5 6.5 @entity65 90 10.1 6.3 the notion that @entity0 ’s side have suddenly become a team of tap dancers is fanciful			1
they are strong , muscular , relentlessly direct			0
but this should have come as no great surprise to @entity64			1
they knew precisely what would confront them , and they failed to cope with the problems			0
for a side with title pretensions , it was woeful			0
@entity8 were winning battles all over the pitch , and might have scored a second when @entity54 dived at a half - chance as a low cross came skidding in from @entity220			1
@entity66 was booked on 44 minutes for cleaning out @entity54 with a peevish assault			2
then , from the rarest of breaks , @entity64 might have equalised on the stroke of half time , when @entity75 almost squeezed in a chance at the near post			1
he failed , and it would have been a travesty had he succeeded			0
@entity85 sat in the dug out , shaking his head			0
this was not how the plot was supposed to unfold			0
the city manager sent out the same side for the second half , presumably obeying the managerial dictum which says : ‘ you lot got us into this			2
you can get us out			0
’ yet his team ’s plight might well have grown even worse when the thoroughly rattled @entity66 went crashing into @entity54 and escaped the card which would have seen him dismissed			0
nevertheless , @entity64 started to enter the game			2
@entity73 began to appear vaguely interested , and the appearance of @entity77 for @entity76 introduced an extra sense of purpose			0
after 59 minutes , they had their best chance yet but @entity75 ’s shot was saved by @entity45 ’s knees			2
a minute later , the @entity266 struck the bar and the ball bounced down to @entity73 , who drove it into the goalkeeper ’s midriff from four yards			0
by now , the fight was on , and @entity64 seemed more likely to prosper when an interchange between @entity74 and @entity75 allowed @entity73 to bounce a drive against the angle of post and bar			1
but in the 75th minute , @entity8 appeared to strike the decisive blow , when @entity220 , advancing down the left , flighted a cross and @entity28 , leaping immoderately , scored the header , becoming just the second player to score in all of his first six @entity99 starts			1
but , as @entity93 celebrated , @entity64 began to play their most impressive football of the match			2
at last , the fluid movement which had been absent returned with a rush , and their reward arrived within two minutes			0
@entity74 picked his way nimbly from the right , deceived @entity51 , and swirled the most precise drive inside the far post			2
from there on , the match was up for grabs , with @entity64 making despairing efforts to take the consolation of a point			2
but @entity8 survived the frenzied attacks , and at the final whistle , they collapsed in claret and blue heaps all over the field ; exhausted , but justly triumphant			2
@entity53 challenges @entity73 for the ball as the @entity64 midfielder looks to break away @entity8 's @entity30 ( left ) competes for the ball with @entity64 midfielder @entity71 @entity8 's @entity46 ( left ) competes for the ball with @entity64 substitute @entity72 the @entity64 away fans shield their eyes from the sun as they watch their side lose at @entity8 @entity64 's manager @entity85 looks dejected as his side fall behind to @entity8 @entity8 manager @entity0 masterminded his side 's win over @entity64 @entity33 looks dejected as he is consoled by @entity51 at the final whistle			1

@entity52 opened the scoring for @entity8 midway through the first half
@entity8 *doubled* their lead *15* minutes from time thanks to a @entity28 header
@entity64 pulled a goal back through @entity74 near the end
