by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here to start managing your @entity3 and plot your way to glory			0
excitement continues to build with the @entity8 season beginning on august 16 ... and that means you have just two weeks to finalise your @entity3			1
with a £ 100million budget you may think the options are unlimited , but that cash needs to fund the purchase of 14 players so a bargain or two can go a long way			0
here , @entity18 give their recommendations on three must - have players for the spine of your team - @entity8 powerhouses @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
fantasy : @entity18 gives you the lowdown on three must - haves if you want to walk away with the title @entity22 ( goalkeeper , @entity30 ) - value £ 5.4m @entity22 excelled at the @entity31 for the @entity32 and he is likely to transfer that form to the @entity8 for @entity35 's side			1
at £ 5.4m @entity22 is a snip compared to @entity37 ( £ 6.0m ) and @entity38 ( £ 5.8m ) and his points return is likely to be extremely similar			2
@entity30 kept an impressive 15 clean sheets last season and @entity22 made some splendid saves , giving him an even greater return of points			2
a good side is built on a solid base with an exceptional goalkeeper and @entity22 fits the bill			2
he plays in a settled side and , at 35 , is showing no signs of ageing			0
he made a @entity31 record 16 saves in just one match in @entity56 - if he was to do that in the @entity8 then his points tally would rocket ! stopper : @entity30 goalkeeper @entity22 is a perfect choice in goal at £ 5.4m due to his side 's tight defence you shall not pass : @entity22 made a @entity31 record 16 saves against @entity68 in @entity56 , racking up the points @entity70 : @entity30 kept 15 clean sheets last season , allowing @entity22 to accumulate lots of points @entity23 ( defender , @entity76 ) - value £ 6.8m if there is one thing @entity79 is renowned for it is getting results based on clean sheets , and the @entity85 trusts his main lieutenant @entity23 to provide them			1
the £ 6.8m price - tag is expensive for a defender but that is because you are signing the @entity90			0
@entity76 kept 16 clean sheets last season and @entity23 played on 34 occasions , meaning he brought in plenty of points			2
what 's more , @entity23 scored three goals last season and he has already netted the same number in pre-season this year - so he can even contribute a bit going forward			1
he has an eye for goal at the minute so it could prove wise to capitalise on that while you can			0
the 33 - year - old will be at the centre of @entity79 's title charge this season , meaning the points @entity23 provides really could end with prizes ... captain marvel : @entity23 is @entity79 's most trusted defensive lieutenant at @entity76 defensive : @entity23 ( left ) was key to @entity76 keeping 16 clean sheets last season in the @entity8 attacking ? the defender also popped up with three goals , and has scored three already in pre-season @entity24 ( midfielder , @entity117 ) - value £ 11.0m he may be the most expensive midfielder on the game , but there 's a perfectly good reason for that - @entity24 absolutely guarantees you points			1
the @entity123 scored an incredible 20 goals from midfield last season , making him worth his weight in gold			0
it 's like having another striker ! the 31 - year - old also provided nine assists and kept 15 clean sheets , meaning he just racks up the points			2
he would be an ideal pick for captain as well , because he benefits from both scoring goals and gaining from @entity117 keeping clean sheets			0
what 's more @entity24 barely misses a game - and for a team who won the title last season , he will continue to provide assists and find the back of the net			1
man - of - the - match awards will also come in abundance for @entity117 's star man			0
he had an unsettled summer and will come back with a point to prove - he is the number one must - have pick			0
pricey but worth it : @entity117 's @entity24 will set you back £ 11m but he will guarantee you points eye for goal : @entity24 ( right ) netted a staggering 20 goals from midfield for @entity117 last season total them up : @entity24 also provided nine assists and @entity117 kept an impressive 15 clean sheets			1

the 2014 - 15 @entity8 season kicks - off on august 16
there 's just two weeks left to finalise your @entity169 team
@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are must - haves for the spine of your team
