by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 10:23 est , 18 october 2013 a sacked @entity1 who is suing @entity4 's @entity3 for discrimination has successfully argued @entity6 is suing @entity7 for disability discrimination after she was turned down when applying to become a pc due to failing a background check which revealed that she had a criminal record for stealing she did not know she had amnesia when she failed to declare a conviction for theft			1
but a tribunal has reserved its decision on several key points that will determine whether her claims against the police force are ultimately successful			2
@entity6 , 43 , took the @entity3 to court after she was denied a role as a police constable in december 2009 , claiming she was discriminated against because of a disability			1
she was denied the job - and has since been sacked - because she was reprimanded earlier that year for failing to declare a conditional discharge for theft in 1991			1
but ms @entity28 had since argued at the time she did not remember being arrested because she suffered dissociative amnesia stemming from personal trauma she had experienced around that time			1
a preliminary hearing at the @entity33 today was tasked to determine whether ms @entity6 knew she had amnesia when she filled out the security form and whether she should have mentioned that on the form			1
ms @entity6 said she was n't aware when she filled out the form and only had any recollection at all she might have been arrested when she was contacted by a vetting officer in february 2009 , about two months after she filled in the security form , to ask why her fingerprints were in the police database			1
' for some strange reason ... i had a couple of small flashes of memory - nothing else , " she said			2
' i still did not know of the existence of the dissociative amnesia then			2
i did n't even know what on earth he was talking about			0
' miss @entity6 also told the hearing that she felt the @entity3 did not support her after she discovered her memory loss			1
' i just had a feeling that some sort of assessment need to be done			0
it is not very nice experience to go through - they refused to provide me with medical assistance			2
' without the help of my family and seeking psychiatric assessment i could have spent the rest of my life not knowing what was going on with my memory			0
' february 26 ( 2009 ) was the first time i was aware there was an allegation of theft that had resulted in the receipt of a conditional discharge			1
' ms @entity6 said she only had any recollection at all she might have been arrested when she was contacted by a vetting officer in february 2009 she added that she did not know what other memories had been lost because of the ' traumas ' she had suffered making her condition ' long - term '			1
not specifying the issues , she said : ' i do n't know how many memories are still lost in my mind			0
they have to be triggered - that is the impairment			2
' i have come to accept that i am going to have to live with this for the rest of my life , waiting for the trigger moment , or hopefully not			0
' as a result of failing to reveal her conviction for theft , believed to involve stealing £ 20 worth of makeup from a @entity95 department store while she worked there as a cashier in 1991 , miss @entity6 was given a reprimand by the @entity3			1
she says that because she had a justifiable medical reason why she did not reveal her criminal record , she should never have received it			0
miss @entity6 believes that she would never have been sacked if the reprimand was not on her record and should now be wiped off			2
judge @entity103 expressed his surprise it remained and said that the @entity3 should look into removing it from the record			2
' she has genuine dissociative amnesia			0
clearly it should be removed from the record , ' he said			0
@entity109 , representing @entity3 , said he accepted ms @entity6 's amnesia was real and she did not know about it at the time			1
but citing medical evidence , mr @entity109 argued ms @entity28 's disability was not long - term and she was not discriminated against because of it			1
once she realised she had amnesia , it was no longer a disability impacting her work , he argued			2
however , ms @entity6 said she had to live with the knowledge that certain triggers could spark repressed memories at any time , which rendered her amnesia an ongoing , long - term disability			1
mr @entity103 reserved his judgement over the point			0
' this is not an easy case , ' he said			0
how ms @entity6 's disability is defined will affect up to five separate claims she has made against the @entity3			1
the latest claim came after she was fired following a disciplinary hearing into an £ 80 littering fine she received for throwing a cigarette butt			0
ms @entity6 said she would never have been sacked if the reprimand was wiped from her record			1
she argued because she had a justifiable medical reason why she did not reveal her criminal record , it should have been			0
the reprimand still remained on her record , she told the tribunal			0
mr @entity103 said he thought it should not have remained there			0
' she has genuine dissociative amnesia ... ( so ) it clearly should be removed from the record , ' he said			0
both parties have been given a week to send mr @entity103 submissions over the point in contention			0
ms @entity6 had previously asked for the hearing to be heard in private , arguing her reputation was being damaged by her case being reported by media			1
mr @entity103 rejected the request .			0
