by @entity0 published : 20:44 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 8 february 2013 the @entity2 's closest aides are to be publicly grilled by @entity3 to justify her spending , the @entity5 can reveal			1
members of prince @entity8 ’s inner circle will also give evidence to @entity10 about whether they are wasting taxpayers ’ money			0
the amount of public funds going to the @entity15 soared last year , despite @entity17 cuts			0
now the most powerful watchdog in @entity19 , the @entity20 , will scrutinise royal finances to ensure the country is getting value for money			1
value for money : the finances of @entity2 , pictured with the @entity26 during her @entity27 , will be scrutinised by the @entity20 committee sources say the @entity3 , chaired by former @entity30 minister @entity29 , will hold hearings into the money paid to @entity8 , before moving on to the @entity33 , the £ 7billion property empire from which the @entity2 derives her income			1
in april , @entity36 will receive a payment of £ 36.1million of public money to fund the @entity2 ’s official duties , a 16 per cent increase on the £ 31million paid by taxpayers to finance the monarchy last year			1
public funding to support prince @entity8 rose by 11 per cent last year , taking the contribution from the taxpayer to almost £ 2.2million			1
his spending rose by 3.6 per cent to more than £ 20.2million			0
the unprecedented @entity48 probe will mean that sir @entity49 , the keeper of the @entity50 – effectively the @entity2 ’s treasurer – will face being questioned in front of the television cameras			1
sir @entity53 and @entity54 , the private secretaries to the @entity2 and prince @entity8 who usually operate behind the scenes , could also be called to give evidence			1
‘ the plan is to do the @entity8 first and then look at the @entity2 , ’ a source told the @entity5			2
‘ we need to be sure when other public services are being cut that there is value for money			0
’ the committee will focus on the @entity2 ’s use of public money to perform her official duties , including official receptions , investitures , garden parties and maintenance of the royal palaces			1
she pays for the running of her household from private income			0
but it will also look at @entity8 and prince @entity54 ’s travel arrangements			0
the £ 2.2million extra @entity79 received last year was primarily spent on overseas tours			2
but critics claim some of the money goes on private visits			0
the inquiry has come about because of a change this year in the way the @entity15 is @entity87 has scrapped the @entity88 – an annual handout to the @entity15 that had to be approved by @entity10 since 1760 – in favour of paying the @entity91 15 per cent of the income from the @entity33 assets , which include @entity94 and @entity96 racecourse			0
but a second part of the deal – enacted into law in 2011 – means the royal finances are now subject to scrutiny by the @entity102			1
and now the @entity20 is set to take up its option of holding public hearings into the @entity15 ’s funding			2
@entity107 mp @entity106 said he backed the move to give @entity10 scrutiny of the @entity2 ’s expenses as long as it was ‘ proportionate ’			2
he added : ‘ it would be unreasonable to examine the @entity2 ’s private sources of income and expenditure			2
@entity30 mp @entity115 , who sits on the @entity20 , said : ‘ it is about ensuring that the public are getting good value for money			0
at the moment there is no accountability for spending what is a considerable fortune			0

@entity36 will receive £ 36.1m to fund the @entity2 's official duties
@entity127 is a 16 *%* increase on the £ 31m paid to finance the monarchy last year
