by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 25 december 2012 doctors have saved a patient 's life by killing off part of his heart with neat alcohol			1
medics used the rare treatment on @entity9 to induce a controlled heart attack , after they realised they could not safely perform standard procedures on him			2
cardiologist dr @entity12 said his 77 - year - old patient would have died without the procedure			2
@entity15 raises a toast with his wife @entity17 to the doctors who saved his life mr @entity9 was suffering from a life - threatening disruption to his heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia ( @entity23 ) - which occurred as a result of a previous heart attack			1
the team decided to treat mr @entity9 , from @entity27 near @entity28 , with ' ethanol ablation '			2
the treatment has only been conducted a handful of times in the @entity34 to treat @entity23 , dr @entity12 said			0
the procedure involves passing a catheter to the heart from the groin which identifies which part of the heart the dangerous rhythms are coming from			0
a tiny balloon is then blown up in the heart artery supplying that area and a small amount of absolute alcohol is injected into the artery to produce a small controlled heart attack			1
@entity49 was suffering from a life threatening disruption to his heart rhythm this kills the area of the heart muscle causing the problem allowing the heart 's rhythm to return to normal			1
mr @entity9 said he was admitted to hospital after his implantable defibrillator ( @entity60 ) gave him a " thunderstorm of shocks "			2
dr @entity12 , an interventional cardiologist , said : ' mr @entity9 presented a couple of months ago with this life - threatening type rhythm disturbance , @entity23 , which was related to the damage done to the heart - the scar associated with his previous heart attack			1
' the defibrillator is there to try and prevent you from dropping dead in the community - they listen out for the heart doing unusual things - if your heart is doing something unusual like going very , very fast , firstly it will try and pace you out of that rhythm - it will try and suppress the activity within the heart			2
' if that fails it will actually illicit a shock of energy across the heart which hopefully straightens things out and puts you back into a normal rhythm			0
' it is potentially a rather difficult thing for a patient to live with because there is that threat that it could go off and actually when it does go off it is like being kicked in the chest			0
' mr @entity9 added : ' i was admitted to the @entity97 after what doctors described as a thunderstorm of shocks from my @entity60			0
' i had an @entity60 fitted about ten years ago after i had a double by - pass operation at the hospital			0
the device gives my heart a shock when the rhythm becomes abnormal ; however , i had about 30 shocks and knew there was something wrong			0
' mr @entity9 was treated at the @entity97 , which is a state - of - the - art centre that opened in 2009 dr @entity12 said the team of medics tried to treat mr @entity9 's irregular heartbeat with medication and " electrical ablation " to try and burn away - or kill off - the area of muscle which was generating the irregular heartbeats			1
consultant cardiologist dr @entity12 performed the rare procedure but they were unable to perform the procedures - so treating they decided to treat mr @entity9 with ethanol ablation			2
' the alternative , unfortunately , was that he was going to die from his irregular heart rhythm , ' he said			1
dr @entity12 has previously performed the procedure for patients with @entity131 - a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick - but this was his first use of the procedure to treat @entity23			1
' the patient is doing tremendously well and is doing and is much better , ' he said			0
' he was n't going to leave hospital unless something was done			1
there was no other option			0
' mr @entity9 added : ' after the procedure i was out of hospital within about three days			1
' i think it 's wonderful that the doctors tried everything to help me			0
if they had n't have done this i would n't be here now			0

@entity9 , 77 , suffering from a life - threatening disturbance to heart rhythm
neat alcohol injected into artery to *destroy* heart muscle causing the problem
patient was well enough to leave hospital three days later
