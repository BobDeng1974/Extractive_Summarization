a dozen or more metal implements are arranged in neat rows on the table next to the bed			2
they look like something @entity6 might have had applied to his monster 's neck			2
i begin to feel nervous			2
what on earth have i got myself into ? the pristine white room adds to the feeling that i 'm about to undergo major surgery			1
i 'm here to try the wackiest face treatment to hit the beauty scene : the tuning fork facial			1
offered at the upmarket @entity21 in @entity22 and other clinics nationwide , the scary sounding tuning forks are pieces of metal that make different pitched sounds when struck and made to vibrate			1
tuned in : @entity27 is given the tuning fork treatment when they are placed on specific parts of the face - the neck , the jowls , forehead and around the eyes - vibrations are said to tighten sagging skin , eradicate dark circles , lessen the appearance of wrinkles and stimulate collagen			1
the results mean that your face looks younger , brighter and more toned			2
some say it 's the non-jab equivalent of @entity47			2
the treatment comes from the @entity49 - where else ? advocates claim the ' sound waves of the forks vibrate and travel deeply into the body along energy pathways , affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed '			1
so far , so @entity58 gibberish			2
there seems to be no scientific proof that tuning forks can make you look younger , prettier or more rested			1
it sounds nutty - the kind of thing practised by people who like panpipes and hemp seeds			1
the @entity70 beauty industry employs more a million people and is worth £ 17 bn i prefer my facials to involve peels , not strange pieces of metal			2
but while i may be sceptical , i am also , at 37 , willing to try anything			2
over the past few years , frown lines have begun to appear on my forehead , and my face appears increasingly pale , puffy and bloated			2
i explain all this to therapist @entity83 , who 's sympathetic			2
' what 's wonderful about these facials is they improve the appearance of the skin , but also treat the cause of the problem , ' she says			1
' if you 're pale , you probably have poor circulation			2
the forks can boost blood flow , which will give you a healthier colour			1
' @entity83 has been a facial acupuncturist for 20 years , but she has started using the forks on their own and in conjunction with needles			1
' i can see my jawline for the first time in a while , and my skin looks plumper and pink , rather than white ' the therapies work on the same principle of @entity108 acupuncture , which follows the idea that our body 's energy - or ' qi ' - flows through 12 main channels called meridians			1
if this flow is interrupted , it can cause ill health and affect our appearance , causing premature ageing , dry skin and eye bags			1
inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy , improving fine lines and circulation , leading to a clearer , rejuvenated complexion			1
@entity83 uses them together for a more powerful effect , but for the needle - phobic the forks can be used on their own			1
certain forks are designed for different parts of the face and the body - there are dozens of them , with names such as ' @entity142 ' , ' @entity143 ' and ' @entity144 '			1
the physical vibrations have an effect on the body , while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing			1
@entity83 pings one of the forks and puts it up to my ear			1
the sound is magical , like a xylophone from outer space			2
she asks me to get on the bed and remove my socks			2
she explains she will tap my feet with the forks and apply needles to ' bring the energy down for grounding ' ( whatever that means ) before starting on the face and getting the energy flowing all around my body			1
@entity83 uses a ' @entity170 ' tuning fork			1
she strikes it against a hard disc strapped on her leg , which creates a vibration , before putting the base of the fork on various points on my feet			1
i can feel a gentle , deep vibration travel through my feet and halfway up my legs			2
it 's a strange , tingly sensation , and builds as she places the fork on more points on my feet			1
within two minutes i feel as if i 'm floating			0
she then puts needles in between my toes to ' cleanse the system '			0
they do n't hurt at all			0
then she moves to my face			0
she feels around my jawline and says she can feel i have raised glands			0
she asks if i get a lot of sore throats , and i say yes			0
' the vibration from the forks can help the lymph glands to drain , which will help bring down the swelling , ' she says , adding that all she 's doing is ' clearing blockages ' , which will help everything work better			1
inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy , improving fine lines and circulation , leading to a clearer , rejuvenated complexion @entity208 finds the physical vibrations have an effect on the body , while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing she also explains that she uses tuning forks to help tighten loose muscle around the jawline			1
as she puts the base of the ' @entity143 ' fork around my jawline , the vibrations go deep into my head			1
it feels odd , but also rather lovely			0
she then puts the forks up to my ears and i hear a clear , deep , bell - like sound that feels as if it 's cleaning my mind			1
all my normal chattering thoughts are gone for a moment			0
@entity83 , who is wafting around the room ethereally , as @entity233 therapists are wont to do , explains in her soft , slow voice that different forks have different sounds , varying from deep and resonant to high - pitched			1
she says the ' @entity144 ' fork is good for wrinkles and crow 's feet , because it relaxes the skin			1
but when she starts talking about how the sounds will ' bring me into alignment with the cycles and rhythms of the cosmos ' , it feels a step too far			1
she found the effect was less pronounced the following day - although she still looked better i begin to feel it is all ridiculous			0
but then she moves up my face			0
@entity83 tells me i have deep lines between my nose and mouth and my cheeks are puffy			0
she asks if i get a lot of sinus problems			0
again , i say yes			0
she 's more thorough than some gps i 've seen			0
@entity83 presses the forks along the side of my nose , where the vibrations should help drain the sinuses , and then my eyes , where apparently they will help reduce dark circles			2
finally , @entity83 comes to my forehead			0
she tells me i have a line forming between my eyebrows , known as the ' suspended sword ' , which can be caused by fear and concentration			0
' do you frown when you are concentrating ? ' she asks			0
' and do you find yourself feeling frightened quite often ? ' she asks			0
yes ! this woman is a mind - reader			0
and then we 're done			0
it feels as if i 've been lying there for a minute , but @entity83 tells me it 's nearly an hour			0
i 'm so relaxed it 's hard to speak			0
apparently , this is normal , the result of feel - good endorphins created when pressure points are stimulated			0
i 'm pleasantly surprised - in the mirror , my face looks less like the @entity286			0
i can see my jawline for the first time in a while , and my skin looks plumper and pink , rather than white			1
the next morning , i take a long , hard look at my face			0
the effect is n't as pronounced as the day before , but my skin looks smoother and i have more colour			2
@entity83 recommends 12 sessions , but most people see a difference after just three or four			0
at £ 90 for an hour , it 's not cheap , but it 's reminded me of a basic beauty truth : a glowing complexion is n't something to be obtained in an expensive cream - it comes from being healthy inside and out			0
@entity83 packs me off with some good advice : drink fresh ginger tea to boost my immune system and try to avoid dairy , which does n't help if you 're prone to congestion , coughs and colds			0
maybe i am the hemp seed type after all			0
i have booked a second appointment			0
@entity314 , the @entity21 , @entity22 ( 020 7631 0156 )			1
at £ 90 for an hour , it 's not cheap			0
