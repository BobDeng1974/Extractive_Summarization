by @entity0 a 31 - year - old civil servant almost died after being bitten by a normally - harmless house spider while in bed at her home in @entity5			2
@entity6 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , suffered horrendous swelling to her arm that blocked the blood flow and turned her limb septic			1
the astonishing bite resulted in her developing @entity14 , a condition which saw muscle and flesh on her arm begin to die			2
horrific pain : mrs @entity6 visited an @entity20 clinic and was told her injuries appeared to be a house spider ( file picture ) bite			1
she was then prescribed antibiotics ‘ it was agony , ’ mrs @entity6 , who has since recovered , told the @entity26 ‘ i was lucky to survive			1
you ’d expect it in @entity30 - but not in @entity8			2
’ there was a possibility that her arm could have been amputated after it turned life - threateningly septic - but it was saved after five operations			1
@entity35 began in february , when she woke up to see a red bite on her left wrist , before her arm began to swell and throb over the next two days			2
mrs @entity6 visited an @entity20 clinic and was told it appeared to be a spider bite			1
she was prescribed antibiotics and told to take paracetamol			0
but things got worse over the next two days and her husband @entity44 , 35 , called 999 after she started throwing up green pus and could n't stand up			1
location : mrs @entity6 suffered the bite , which caused horrendous swelling to her arm , in bed at her home in @entity7 , @entity8 ( file picture of area ) her muscles and nerves were dying			1
surgeons spent three days removing infected tissue before they used flesh from her thigh to rebuild the arm			0
' i know i have been very lucky to survive and keep my arm			0
i ca n’t believe all this happened over a spider bite ' @entity6 , 31 she spent three weeks in hospital but is now back at work now after physiotherapy , although her arm still bears the scars of what happened , reported the @entity26 experts told the newspaper that house spiders have fangs big enough to penetrate human skin - but are not known to attack people			1
mrs @entity6 told the @entity26 : ‘ i know i have been very lucky to survive and keep my arm			1
i ca n’t believe all this happened over a spider bite			0
‘ i now sleep with my window shut and check the bed before getting in			0
’ compartment syndrome can be caused by severe swelling that arises from an injury , such as a limb being crushed			1
but it can also be caused by a venomous snake or insect bite , surgery or a severe bone fracture			0
medical literature suggests being bitten by a spider is a more unusual way to develop the condition , thought to affect around 2,000 adults in the @entity5 each year			0
muscles in areas such as the lower leg and forearm are separated into compartments by strong bands of tissues			0
compartment syndrome causes painful swelling and increased pressure within one of these compartments			0
the tough , inflexible nature of these tissues means they can not stretch to accommodate swelling , to the point that blood can not supply the muscles and nerves with oxygen and nutrients			1
if the syndrome is left untreated , the muscles and nerves fail and may eventually die			0
symptoms may include : numbness , pain and / or pale skin in the affected region ; severe pain upon moving the affected limb ; gaining no relief from painkillers ; tight , swollen , and shiny - looking skin over the affected area			2
the treatment for acute compartment syndrome is surgery			0
this involves freeing up the bands of tissue ( rather like splitting open the casing of the sausage ) , relieving pressure on the muscles and nerves .			0
