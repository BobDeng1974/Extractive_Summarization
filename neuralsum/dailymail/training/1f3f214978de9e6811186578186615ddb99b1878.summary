by @entity0 healthy snack : the cookie , baked for website @entity3 , is designed for slimmers who do n't want to give up their treats it could be the tasty way to lose weight			1
a chocolate chip cookie packed with as much protein as two chicken breasts is being billed as a new weapon in the fight against flab			2
designed for slimmers who ca n’t give up their treats , its high protein content should help slimmers feel fuller for longer			1
the chocolate chip cookie is also lower in fat , sugar and calories than usual			0
despite this , it is claimed taste is n’t compromised – and the fact that they have sold out three times in the past month seems to bear testament to this			0
baked in @entity33 for specialist food website @entity35 , the biscuits weigh a whopping 77g			1
some 40g of this – or more than half of it – is made up of soy , milk and other proteins , following research suggesting that the nutrient is especially good at keeping hunger pangs at bay			1
fat is reduced by using cocoa powder rather than milk chocolate and an artificial sweetener helps keep the amount of sugar used to under a teaspoon per cookie			2
however , they do n’t come cheap , at £ 19.95 for a box of ten – or almost £ 2 each			1
@entity57 , of @entity58 said : ‘ we ’re a nation of biscuit lovers but we have become far more conscious about what put into our bodies			1
‘ we were determined to create a product that could stand up to leading @entity66 brands in terms of taste and texture but with greater nutritional benefits			0
‘ these cookies will complement hard work in the gym and efforts to shed pounds			0
’ @entity75 , a spokesman for the @entity76 , agreed that studies have shown protein to be particularly satisfying			0
however , despite the efforts made , the cookies are still high in fat and calories , with a single cookie containing as many calories as a dieter ’s entire lunch			2
’ @entity100 , professor of human nutrition at @entity101 , described the protein content as ‘ huge ’			0
he said : ‘ that is very remote from the type of food which humans evolved to eat , and very high protein foods put the kidneys under pressure - in rare cases resulting in serious renal failure			2
so i would not want to eat this type of cookie			0
