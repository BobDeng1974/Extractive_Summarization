created group ' @entity1 ' before posting messages saying ' who 's up for it ? ' group invitation sent to 700 people in @entity7 after first outbreak of violence by @entity11 reporter last updated at 1:44 am on 1st december 2011 relief : @entity13 avoided a prison sentence despite posting messages on her @entity17 page to encouraging people to loot during the @entity20 riots a teenager facing jail for inciting a riot during the summer troubles walked free from court yesterday after a judge decided she was guilty only of making a ‘ stupid ’ joke on @entity17			1
@entity13 , 19 , had faced a five - year jail sentence under a relatively new section of the @entity30 of ' encouraging the commission of an offence believing it would be committed '			2
but judge @entity33 recognised that slang acronyms such as @entity35 backed up her claim that her ' @entity1 ' event page had been set up in jest			1
@entity39 had created the @entity17 group and even posted on the message board , just hours before looters trawled shops , homes and local businesses throughout the @entity20			1
her messages such as @entity35 - which means ' laughing my f * * * * * * @entity50 ' and is used to indicate you 're laughing - were alleged by authorities to have incited criminality			1
but the judge said he could not accept that the term referred to miss @entity13 ' sitting in her bedroom laughing inwardly about @entity7 being burned to the ground '			1
the former pupil at @entity60 was stunned when a marked police car turned up at her door in at the family home in the suburbs of the @entity66 town on the evening of ' one of the darkest summer days ' @entity20 had ever seen			2
she was placed in the back and taken to the police station where she spent the night in custody before telling police the following afternoon she ' was just mucking about '			2
at @entity74 yesterday the case was thrown out after a one - hour ' trial ' that followed a previous @entity77 plea and directions hearing and two magistrates ' court appearances			2
there was no dispute that @entity39 created the @entity17 event page ' @entity1 ' which was sent to more than 700 people on tuesday august 9 about 5.30pm			1
in the early hours of the following morning police would face their fourth night of rioting and running battles with looters in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
however , @entity95 , the recorder of @entity74 , said there was not enough evidence to disprove miss @entity13 's claim that it was a joke , adding : ' that 's been her account from the start '			1
thrown out : judge @entity33 rejected calls for @entity13 to face a jail sentence at @entity74 crown court the judge was also bemused that police had not asked miss @entity13 about the letters @entity35			2
defending barrister @entity107 said : ' to put it bluntly , it 's riddled with references to jokes			1
' @entity112 , prosecuting , also failed to mention the letters when opening the case and when asked by the judge what if he knew what the abbreviation meant said he did not and had ' no instructions '			2
opening the case mr @entity112 told the jury : ' it is not in dispute as to what happened			2
the key issue is what was meant by what happened			2
that 's for you to decide - to interpret the actions of the defendant which she admitted carrying out			1
' this was in the dark days of summer just gone , metaphorically speaking			2
some of the darkest days perhaps you will recall this country has had on its shores for a number of years			2
' i 'm talking about the riots			0
on august 9th the country was in the thick of them			0
' the prosecution say no one could think anything like that was funny			0
it 's not funny now			1
it certainly was not funny on 9 august			0
' the case against miss @entity13 suggested her @entity17 group encouraged looters the court was told @entity39 , who is now pregnant and expecting her first child in april , had been sitting alone in her bedroom that evening when she created the @entity1 page with a picture of the town centre and the cathedral and message : ' who 's up for it ? ' she told police because of the way the @entity17 events system works she had to put a date in and chose the following saturday when @entity7 city centre would have been packed with people			1
the event was received by more than 700 people , of which 62 replied they would not come , 16 said they could , five were " maybes " and 691 did not reply			1
miss @entity13 admitted she did not actually know most of them			0
the alarm was raised when one of miss @entity13 's @entity173 @entity172 , 16 , accessed his @entity17 account via his iphone and told his brother @entity176 who is a policeman			1
earlier , miss @entity13 's friends had warned her she was getting herself into trouble			1
@entity180 wrote : ' @entity13 , this is stupid			0
why are you even making this event ? you might think it 's funny but it 's not			1
' all you are doing is causing trouble and not just for yourself but everybody else			0
if i was you i would just delete this			0
' several young people targeted were encouraged via various social mediums to loot throughout the @entity20 before posting pictures of their successful looting but miss @entity13 left the page up and sobbed out an interview about what had happened the following afternoon to pc @entity197 after a night in custody she said : ' i made it			1
i was joking with my friends			0
i did not realise the police would get involved			0
i was just mucking about			0
' i did not believe it when the police came around			0
there is nothing more for me to say except i should n't have done it			0
it was just a joke			0
i was not really going to do it			0
' but @entity210 asked her : ' have you seen all the disruption ? have you seen all the property damage ? all the police officers that have been injured ? all the houses and businesses that have been burned to the ground ? people 's lives have been put in danger			1
is it funny now ? ' but the judge agreed after 45 minutes of prosecution evidence there was no case to answer			0
he rejected the @entity77 's argument that similar previous cases which resulted in jail terms would have been equally difficult to prove			1
the judge maintained those cases were different because the defendants pleaded guilty and could not accept @entity35 referred to miss @entity13 ' sitting in her bedroom , creating this , and laughing inwardly about @entity7 being burned to the ground '			1
there were tears from the @entity39 family as the judge ordered the jury to acquit her of encouraging violent disorder on @entity17			0
one said : ' we are just glad it 's all over			1
' miss @entity13 , who is only about 5ft in height , and dressed all in black , was hugged by her parents @entity245 , an ambulance paramedic , and @entity247 , a hospital cleaner			0
the teenager appeared in a daze after the verdict was announced			0
mr @entity39 said : ' we do n't want to talk about it now or ever			0
' @entity13 , a former pupil of @entity7 's @entity254 , lives with her parents in a semi-detached house and was charged under the @entity257 2007			1
the court heard there was no @entity260 in the end			0
miss @entity13 told police had lives and businesses been endangered she would have felt ' awful and that it was all my fault ' .			0
