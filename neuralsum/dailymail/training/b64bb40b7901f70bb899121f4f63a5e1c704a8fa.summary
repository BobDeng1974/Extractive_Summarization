a devoted cat owner claims her beloved moggies saved her life by alerting her to the fact she had cancer			1
@entity5 , 55 , had no symptoms of the disease - but says her three feline friends repeatedly nudged her stomach			2
her doctor later discovered a tumour on her appendix â€“ a rare cancer usually has no symptoms and normally goes undiagnosed until it is too late			2
@entity5 , 55 , claims her cats followed her around , lying on her stomach and poking at her abdomen in an effort to alert her to a tumour on her appendix			1
mrs @entity5 is pictured with her cat @entity20 mrs @entity5 credits her cat @entity20 ( pictured ) and her other two moggies @entity22 and @entity23 for helping alert her to a tumour on her appendix , which is usually symptomless and normally goes undiagnosed until it is too late mrs @entity5 from @entity26 , @entity27 , who has now had surgery and is recovering , said : ' they have saved my life			1
' i adored them in the first place , but this just made my love for them even stronger			0
' @entity23 , @entity22 and @entity20 first noticed something was wrong in february 2014			1
mrs @entity5 claims they constantly followed her around and sat on her lap poking at her abdomen			1
in july , six months after the cats first indicated a problem , she found a small lump after losing some weight and headed to her doctor			1
it was originally thought she had an ovarian cyst , but this was later dismissed , as were ovarian cancer and bowel cancer as possible causes			2
as doctors were baffled about what type of cancer she had , mrs @entity5 needed the support of her husband @entity56 , 65 , one of her step - daughters @entity59 - a dermatologist who works with skin cancer sufferers - as well as her beloved cats			1
after listening to her pets ' intuition , and losing some weight , mrs @entity5 found a lump on her stomach which turned out to be cancerous			1
she underwent a complex 12 hour operation to remove part of a section of her bowel along with her appendix , spleen , gall bladder and cervix ( pictured ) they started researching the symptomless condition and mrs @entity5 was eventually diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei			1
this is a rare cancer of the appendix , and she began treatment at @entity81 and @entity82 in september			1
in october she underwent a life - saving 12 - hour operation at @entity84 , all thanks to her three pets			1
the incredibly complex and invasive operation was carried out by two teams of surgeons who removed a section of her bowel along with her appendix , spleen , gall bladder and cervix			1
dogs can be trained to smell cancer in its early stages , according to charity @entity97			2
the organisation now has 12 dogs who live with host families and come to work from monday to friday at the charity 's headquarters near @entity104 , detecting traces of cancer from urine and breath samples			2
they are trained by sniffing urine samples of people with cancer and rewarded when they single out these samples from other urine from non-cancer sufferers			2
malignant cells produce changes in volatile organic compounds , and it 's these compounds which dogs are believed to detect in urine			0
dogs can detect odours at concentrations as low as one part per trillion , identifying scents which the human nose could never detect			0
humans have five million sensor receptors dedicated to smell - dogs have 300 million , the charity says			0
the procedure also involved a full hysterectomy and left her with a huge scar , which her grandchildren have nicknamed ' @entity140 's zipper '			0
but mrs @entity5 says she has her cats to thank for saving her life			1
she said : ' i absolutely believe the cats knew			0
' the cancer is a molecular change in your body so you give off a different smell that they pick up on and they just try to get your attention			0
' for a while my cats had been following me around but that 's normal - they 're cats and that 's what they do			0
' but it got more and more intense and for months they stayed with me everywhere i went			0
' if was n't until the day i got back from the doctors that they disappeared into their normal spots			0
' it was as if they were saying , " finally , you 've discovered it "			0
' the surgery was horrendous and i was in intensive care for a couple of days on morphine but i would have died without it			0
' even thinking was hard work , i could n't talk properly or move without becoming exhausted			0
' i was overwhelmed by the goodwill and wishes of not just family , but friends and people from work			0
' it was unbelievable , they were seriously concerned and upset , not only that i had cancer but that i had to go through all of that			0
' i absolutely believe the cats knew , ' mrs @entity5 says			2
' the cancer is a molecular change in your body so you give off a different smell that they pick up on and they just try to get your attention , ' she is pictured with her husband @entity192 photos of her beloved cats @entity20 ( left ) , @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity23 ( right )			1
