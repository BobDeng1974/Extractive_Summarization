musicians have rallied around a fellow subway performer who was arrested for playing at a @entity4 subway stop - after the cop recited the law saying he was allowed to be there			1
@entity8 , 30 , was ejected from the @entity10 subway platform at the @entity12 stop on friday after calmly explaining to the officer that he was doing nothing illegal			1
a video of the incident captured by straphangers waiting for a train shows a police officer approaching @entity8 and telling him he needed a permit to play there - which the musician disputes			1
' i 'm not going to argue with you , ' the officer says calmly in response			2
@entity8 points him to the correct part of the @entity33 's rules , right anger : the officer , who has not been identified , decided to eject the musician anyway and told him to stop @entity8 , also speaking evenly , refuses to leave and tells the officer he has a right to be there performing , then directs him to the section in the @entity33 's rules of conduct that says artistic performances and solicitations of donations are allowed			1
the flustered officer reads the section aloud and discovers that the musician is indeed right - but still decides to eject him anyway			0
while the @entity33 rules did state he could be there , there remains a gray area - because @entity33 rules differ from state law , which says an entertainer can be arrested for loitering in a transportation facility unless he was authorized to be there			1
as the police officer calls for backup on the video , straphangers clap and @entity8 puts his guitar back on and continues singing			1
the officer approaches him again to make him stop			2
you 're leaving , ' the officer says			0
fighting back : @entity8 carries on playing so the officer removes his guitar - but he continues singing anyway kicked out : several other police officers eventually arrive and forcibly remove the man from the station not giving up : but even as he is handcuffed , @entity8 continues singing			1
he was arrested for loitering the officer removes theguitar from the shoulders of @entity8 , who continues to sing a cappella			1
' i 'm being oppressed , ' says the musician , wearing hot pink socks , no shoes , a jacket , a tie and a fedora			0
meanwhile , straphangers taunt the officer and ask if there are more serious crimes he should be policing , with one pointing out there are crack dealers operating in the city , while others say they see the musician every day and enjoy listening to his music			0
eventually , several other uniformed and plainclothes police officers arrive at the station and force @entity8 to the floor before handcuffing him - as he continues to sing - and dragging him out			1
as he is pulled up the stairs , travelers shout ' f * * * the police '			2
the video was posted online and has been viewed more than 800,000 times			0

the musician , who has been performing in the subway since 2008 , has previously received two tickets at the station			0
' this time , i decided that i was just going to stand up for my rights and say no , ' he told @entity130			0
