a @entity1 pensioner who is expecting quadruplets said she went in search of sperm and egg donors when her youngest of 13 children told her : ' i want to have a little brother or sister			1
' @entity10 , 65 , was plunged into a vortex of travel and trials thanks to the wish of daughter @entity15 , who turns ten this year , but says she is not bothered about what people say about her decision to have more children so late in life			1
their scheduled births for the schoolteacher from @entity24 , @entity25 , is just weeks away - but there are major fears that the health risks for her unborn quads will spike massively if they are induced early			1
babies on the way : @entity10 , 65 , and her nine - year - old daughter @entity15 are seen during a recent ultrasound filmed for an upcoming documentary about how the teacher is preparing to welcome the quads @entity10 , meanwhile , is weathering the debate centred on the rights or wrongs of her decision to both become pregnant and raise the children with cool detachment			1
' there will obviously be cliches bandied about , ' she said , ' and i find that quite strenuous			0
but i have always been a person who says live and let live and it is not for the opinion of others but for me			0
' i have enough experience of childbirth not to be afraid			0
i am not scared actually , i am just hoping to stay healthy and fit			1
if others are mega-prim about this i believe they have no interesting lives themselves and therefore it no longer bothers me			0
i think this is the right choice			0
' ' she is a very strong , very fit woman , ' her doctor , @entity60 tells @entity61			1
' i hope she can come to full term , i think she can			0
she is very well placed to be a fit mother for these babies			2
the schoolteacher from @entity24 , @entity25 , is set to become the world 's oldest woman to give birth to quads ms @entity10 and her large brood are seen during an appearance on @entity1 television in 2005 ' the pregnancy so far makes no distinction between the body of a younger or older person but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high burden			1
' we of course are keeping a close watch on the cardiovascular system			0
we all have little or no experience with such a pregnant woman in this age group , but i can say that this is certainly going very well			1
' thrombosis , her heart , her circulatory system - these are the areas causing concern for the unborns in the run - up to delivery day			2
' but she is highly motivated and this positive psychological mood is optimally important , the rest is not in our hands , ' added her gynaecologist			0
both were speaking in a clip released by the @entity106 tv network which is airing her story on monday night			0
one woman who had a child at 42 tells the programme : ' i met her and found her to be a very sympathetic and intelligent woman			0
' as a 56 - year - old woman who raised a just - pubescent son , it is hard to imagine why she would want to have quads			2
i also wonder how she can meet the needs of her growing children , especially as the children will have no father			2
' it was mentioned in the publicity clip released by @entity106 that her fertility treatment - including both donated eggs and donated sperm - would never have been greenlighted in @entity1			1
two countries where treatment for women of such an advanced age is allowed were stated as @entity129 and @entity130			2
all her 13 children , ranging from @entity15 to a daughter of 44 , were sired by five different fathers .			1
