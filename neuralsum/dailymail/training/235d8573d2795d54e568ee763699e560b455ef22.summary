about the last thing @entity1 remembered was her husband @entity2 turning off the lights and getting into bed			1
then , she eventually told detectives , they held hands as they drifted off to sleep			2
three hours later her nightmare began			0
a brutal gang burst into the hut where the @entity11 were staying at the remote but luxurious @entity12 in @entity13 on september 11 , 2011			1
they shot @entity2 dead and took @entity1 hostage			1
after beating her with a rifle butt , they dragged her to the beach and took her by boat to @entity21 , where she was held in primitive conditions for more than six months			2
a seasoned team from @entity25 ’s @entity24 reached @entity12 two days after her abduction			0
the evidence given by its leader , detective superintendent @entity28 , would later prove crucial in the trial of the only man charged in connection with @entity1 ’s kidnap – @entity33 , an illiterate @entity13 woodcutter and gatherer of wild forest honey			1
ordeal : @entity1 and husband @entity2 in @entity13 just days before the gang struck trial : @entity33 in court convicted and sentenced to death by hanging , he is now on death row in a tough jail in @entity45			1
after the 16 - month trial ended last year , the @entity46 treated this as a triumph			0
‘ welcome conviction … today of mr @entity33 for his role in @entity1 kidnap and murder , ’ tweeted @entity50 , the @entity51 ambassador to @entity21			1
but @entity56 can reveal that if @entity13 hangs @entity33 , it is likely to be executing an innocent man			1
we can disclose that : the conviction is deemed so unsafe it faces a @entity64 challenge in @entity65 , led by @entity66 , a former director of public prosecutions			0
the transcript of @entity33 ’s trial and key statements taken by @entity25 detectives have been obtained by this newspaper			2
the documents show the main reason for @entity33 ’s arrest was a decision by @entity13 police to quiz anyone seen in the vicinity of the @entity12			1
‘ we told hotel workers to arrest anybody seen around the premises and report to police , ’ @entity79 , from @entity13 ’s @entity80 , told the court			1
@entity33 finally does have a local lawyer , @entity86 , who will be fighting his appeal in @entity13			1
he said yesterday : ‘ there were no clues that led particularly to him			0
they just took him into custody and then tried to make the evidence fit			0
’ of course , by the time the manhunt started , the kidnappers and mrs @entity1 were in nearby somalia.at his trial , @entity33 insisted that he himself had been a victim of crime : deep in the forest , ivory poachers had stolen his shoes and his tools – a power saw and a machete called a panga			1
escaping their clutches , he came across a police vehicle near @entity12			0
he approached it to report the theft and promptly became a suspect – mainly , it seems , because he said he thought the poachers were @entity21			0
crime scene : the ' banda ' where @entity115 was killed @entity33 and his family are desperately poor			1
they live in the village of @entity119 , a few miles from @entity120			0
@entity33 ’s wife divorced him after the trial so his two sons , aged five and seven , live in a one - room mud - hut with @entity33 ’s father , @entity125 , who is in his 80s and blind			2
@entity125 said that without his son , the family has almost no income : ‘ we depend on help from anyone who comes to visit us			0
’ @entity125 ’s elderly wife weaves mats , but could make less than £ 1 each from selling them			0
@entity125 is sure his son is innocent : ‘ i cry thinking of him and the pain and hardship he is suffering			0
all we can do is pray			0
but we are happy that good people have come to be his lawyers			0
’ in his trial testimony , @entity33 claimed he was tortured			2
as well as beating him , he said police ‘ pulled my private parts ’ which had made him incontinent			0
police denied this , but when he was first due in court in @entity152 , two hearings had to be adjourned because he needed hospital treatment			2
@entity33 said at his trial : ‘ they wanted me to admit i had witnessed the killing of the white man and kidnapping of the white woman			1
’ he did not confess			0
enter the @entity25 's finest @entity28 arrived in @entity12 two days after @entity33 ’s arrest , accompanied by six detectives			1
they were later joined by a ballistics expert , a crime scene manager , a photographer , a blood spatter analyst , and a fingerprint specialist			1
by now , their @entity13 colleagues were suggesting that @entity33 ’s role had been to guide the gang to the ‘ banda ’ , the hut where the @entity11 were staying			1
surprisingly , perhaps , the yard team did not interview @entity33 , though if the @entity13 theory was true , he presumably must have had vital clues to the gang ’s whereabouts and identity			1
in any event , the @entity25 ’s @entity181 expertise was to have little impact : there was no forensic evidence linking @entity186 to the crime			0
but although he failed to come up with any evidence , mr @entity28 ’s stature as a senior @entity25 officer meant his opinions carried huge weight			1
before the trial started , he set down a formal , written statement , which was later read out in court			2
its influence was enormous : when judge @entity198 delivered his final judgment , he closely echoed both the reasoning and the language of mr @entity28 ’s account			1
in mr @entity28 ’s view , the critical piece of evidence was a pair of ‘ @entity208 shoes , ’ a type of plastic sandal			1
according to mr @entity28 , distinctive @entity208 footprints were found leading from the beach where the gang landed their boat to the bandas			1
‘ these appear to be the shoeprints of someone searching the bandas for potential victims , ’ he said			0
he added in his statement : ‘ @entity33 was arrested wearing @entity208 shoes			1
it is extremely unusual to find these at the resort			0
none of the staff are allowed to wear these shoes			0
all of the suspects in the boat [ with mrs @entity1 ] were barefooted			1
’ mr @entity28 went on : ‘ @entity208 shoes are predominantly worn by @entity21 and are not allowed to be worn at @entity12			1
to have a set of @entity208 footprints at the resort is highly unusual and significant			0
’ he repeated these claims in court			0
an unfair trial ? hostage : @entity1 the day she was freed in @entity21 apart from the lack of forensic evidence , the prosecution faced a further difficulty			1
interviewed by police after her release , mrs @entity1 , of @entity242 , @entity243 , was clear the gang had turned the lights on when they burst in			1
but when detectives showed her photos of @entity33 , she said : ‘ prior to seeing these images , i had never seen this man before			1
he was not one of the men who took me out of the banda , who were present on the boat or held me during my time in captivity			2
’ it was possible there had been someone else present grappling with her husband , but if so , she had not seen him			2
there is no legal aid in @entity13 other than for defendants charged with murder , and @entity33 was ‘ only ’ charged with robbery with violence and kidnapping			1
a lawyer arrived to represent him at one hearing , but did not bother to speak to him			0
for the whole of the prosecution case , dragged out over months , @entity33 had no lawyer			2
moreover , he is not fluent in @entity271 , the language in which the trial was conducted			2
he asked repeatedly for an interpreter to translate into his mother tongue , @entity277 – but was refused			0
mr @entity86 said : ‘ a totally uneducated man , he was forced to cross-examine witnesses speaking in a language he did not fully understand			1
to make matters worse , mr @entity28 and mrs @entity1 gave evidence in @entity279 , which he does n’t know			1
’ their evidence was translated into @entity271			0
so what of the @entity208 shoes ? they were produced in court as an exhibit , but none of those who first came into contact with @entity33 when he emerged from the forest mentioned them			2
and as for mr @entity28 ’s claim that they were worn mainly by @entity21 , several witnesses said they were common in @entity13			1
mr @entity28 admitted they did not bear @entity33 ’s fingerprints			1
if they were tested for his dna , this was never mentioned			0
nor were there any photos of the footprints			2
astonishingly , corporal @entity305 , the @entity13 officer who arrested @entity33 , told the court that the defendant ‘ was not wearing any shoes ’			1
almost at the end of the trial , mr @entity86 agreed to represent the defendant for free			2
aware that the shoes were too small , he asked @entity186 to try them on			2
mr @entity86 said yesterday : ‘ he could n’t get into them at all , much less walk			0
’ it was all to no avail			0
on july 27 last year , the judge convicted @entity33 and decreed he ‘ suffer death , as provided by law ’			2
@entity321 , @entity45 @entity25 and the @entity322 have agreed to respond to the pending @entity64 action by june 4			0
the action , brought by the human rights charity @entity325 , asks the court to issue a statement saying the involvement of @entity51 authorities was unlawful because @entity33 ’s trial was an abuse of natural justice , and – because he faced a death sentence – a breach of guidelines that say @entity51 police may offer only ‘ limited assistance ’ when a suspect faces such punishment			1
@entity25 refused to comment on the case			0
the @entity322 said the @entity342 ’s help followed ‘ assurances from the @entity13 authorities that @entity51 assistance would not directly or significantly contribute to a violation of human rights and / or international humanitarian law ’			0
but @entity325 ’s @entity349 said : ‘ i fail to see what assurances they can have been given when he was facing what amounted to a mandatory death sentence , and a farce of a trial			0
’ meanwhile , @entity33 languishes on death row at the notorious @entity359 maximum security prison in @entity45			1
one source said : ‘ @entity361 is one of the worst places in @entity13			0
just its name instills fear when prisoners are told they are to be moved there			0
’ @entity13 has not carried out an execution since 1987 , but mr @entity86 pointed out this policy could change with the government or shifting political whims			2
the @entity56 approached mrs @entity1 via publishers @entity372 , where her husband was finance director and which published her account of her ordeal , a @entity376			1
a spokesman said she could not make any comment			0
mr @entity86 said : ‘ a favourable judgment from the court in @entity65 would help @entity33 enormously			2
it could tip the balance			0
ultimately , it could save his life			0

@entity1 was kidnapped by a gang while on *holiday* in @entity13 in 2011
her husband , @entity2 , was shot dead and @entity1 taken hostage for six months
@entity33 , a @entity13 woodcutter , is the only man charged over the crime
@entity33 is currently on death row in a tough jail in @entity45
the @entity56 can reveal that he is very likely to be innocent
@entity1 said she did *n't* recognise him as being present during her ordeal
astonishingly , mrs @entity1 said that until she was shown photos of @entity33 after his arrest , she had never seen him before . she told police she did n’t recognise him being present either when her husband was shot or when she was in captivity .
@entity33 was said to be wearing shoes that matched footprints at the crime scene when he was arrested . but the arresting officer told the court that @entity33 was not wearing shoes at all – and he could n’t fit into those that *supposedly* matched the prints as they were two sizes too small .
the trial was held in a language in which he was not fluent , and for almost all of it he had no defence lawyer . he had to cross-examine witnesses including @entity421 and mr @entity28 on his own .
