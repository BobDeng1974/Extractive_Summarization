by @entity0 an earthquake off the coast of @entity3 today sparked fears @entity4 may have carried out his threat to conduct more nuclear tests			0
the magnitude - five tremor was detected 80 miles from the @entity9 at around 3.48am local time ( 7.48pm yesterday gmt ) , according to the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
it comes just two days after the sabre - rattling state threatened to launch a ' new form ' of nuclear power tests - and hours after the @entity16 exchanged artillery fire near a disputed sea boundary in a heightening of tensions on the peninsula			1
but its location at a depth of nearly 10 miles in the sea did not immediately suggest nucelar testing was the cause this time , it was reported by the @entity42			1
yesterday , @entity43 fired shells into @entity3 waters after their rivals sent more than 100 rounds below the disputed sea boundary during a live - fire drill			0
the heated artillery exchange was prompted by an unusual warning fax sent from the @entity52 to the @entity43 , informing them of their live - fire drill			1
though it is not unusual for the reclusive nation to practice at sea , @entity43 officials were alarmed by the alert , which they claim ' indicates their hostile intention '			0
suspicious : wreckage of a crashed drone on @entity63 near the disputed waters of the @entity65 , triggering an investigation by @entity43 into whether the aircraft was from the @entity52 @entity43 was also investigating an unmanned drone which crashed on one of its islands , a @entity43 defence ministry official said on tuesday , triggering an investigation into whether the aircraft was from the @entity52			1
the drone fell on @entity63 at about 4pm ( 0700 gmt ) on monday during the artillery exchanges			0
the @entity43 military was trying to verify where the drone had come from and what its purpose might have been , and was also looking into any possible link to @entity3 's espionage operations , the military official told @entity86			0
on saturday , @entity3 also accused the @entity43 of ' gangster - like ' behaviour by ' abducting ' one of its fishing boats and threatened to retaliate			1
has previous : @entity4 members of the military in march last year when tensions spiked after a near - daily barrage of @entity3 threats , including warnings of nuclear strikes against @entity98 and @entity99 the @entity100 said it had sent the boat back after it drifted into its waters			0
hours later , @entity103 threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point			2
last spring , tension spiked after a near - daily barrage of @entity3 threats , including warnings of nuclear strikes against @entity98 and @entity99 , following international criticism of @entity103 's third nuclear test in february of that year			2
but the @entity52 has gradually dialed down its threats and sought to improve ties with @entity43 in what foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure international investment and aid			2
the @entity3 live - fire drills and the country 's hints at a nuclear test are meant to express anger and frustration over what the @entity52 sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with @entity43 and the @entity128 , said @entity129 , a @entity3 expert at @entity43 's @entity130			1
@entity129 said the @entity16 might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants			0
