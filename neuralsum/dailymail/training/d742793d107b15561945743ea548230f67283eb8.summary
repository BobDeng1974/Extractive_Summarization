@entity0 had wanted an @entity1 run to galvanise his struggling @entity3 side , so this defeat will only heap further worry on a club going backwards			1
the @entity7 had started the season looking as if they ’d be challenging the @entity10 ’s top six but appear more likely to become embroiled in a dogfight at the bottom should this winless run stretch much longer than its current eight games			1
even the floodlights packed up on the hosts , suspending the first half for 10 minutes and the manager saw @entity20 meekly sent off for a second booking which summed up another dour afternoon			1
@entity23 's @entity22 celebrates after scoring his side 's opening goal against @entity3 @entity26 appeared to be delighted with his first goal of the afternoon @entity28 ( third on right ) celebrates getting @entity3 back on level terms against @entity23 addicks skipper @entity33 fires in an effort on goal for the hosts during the match @entity3 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity38 6 ; @entity39 6 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 6.5 ; @entity28 7 ( @entity43 84 - 6 ) , @entity33 6 , @entity20 6 , @entity44 6 ; church 5 ( @entity45 63 - 6 ) @entity46 4 ( @entity47 89 ) subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goal : @entity54 55 booked : @entity20 , @entity55 sent off : @entity20 72 @entity23 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity56 5 , @entity57 7 , @entity58 6 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 ; @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6.5 ; @entity22 8 , @entity63 7.5 ( @entity64 72 - 6 ) , @entity65 7 ; @entity66 6.5 subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 goals : @entity22 4 , 59 booked : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity74 referee : @entity76 attendance : 8,727 @entity78 man : @entity22 going with what is close to their best xi , @entity3 lacked ideas or invention against a @entity23 team who maximised their squad depth with seven changes			1
the league is much more important for @entity89 - he has designs of the play - offs - but it was the visitors who meant business and were ahead inside four minutes			0
@entity65 teased down the left and floated a cross towards @entity22 , starting his first game since september , to head beyond @entity38			1
they should have been out of sight long before this was eventually over			0
@entity66 , all alone at the back post , could only head straight at the goalkeeper , while @entity65 skewed wide when it was easier to score			0
it had all the hallmarks of a game between two @entity10 sides suffering for form and was - for the majority - a rather rank affair			2
but this third round clash was lit up by a moment of invention from the lively @entity28 who - standing over a dead ball 30 yards out - spotted @entity56 too far across his line and wonderfully beat the goalkeeper at the near post			2
@entity3 were level for just four minutes though			2
@entity22 got his second , but was indebted to the team move preceding it			0
the imperious @entity63 jinked in midfield , keeping hold of possession , before @entity61 knocked a super through - ball into @entity66 ’s path and he found @entity22 to thunder in			0
there was time for @entity74 to rattle the bar late on , but this was done well before then			0
@entity20 ( centre ) is given his marching orders by referee @entity130 after fouling @entity65 the third round @entity1 clash was suspended for 10 minutes during the first half due to floodlight failure @entity63 runs past @entity3 defender @entity40 - @entity134 during the @entity1 third round encounter midfielder @entity33 and manager @entity0 walk off the @entity137 pitch despondently after the 2 - 1 defeat			1

@entity22 double *ensured* @entity23 defeated @entity10 rivals
@entity3 's @entity28 scored for the home side
@entity7 midfielder @entity20 was sent off in the 72nd minute
@entity1 encounter was suspended during first half due to floodlight failure
