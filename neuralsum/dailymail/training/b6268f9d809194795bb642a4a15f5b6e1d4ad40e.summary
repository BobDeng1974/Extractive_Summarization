leaked documents show how 343 @entity23 and overseas companies shrink their tax bills by routing their profits through the tiny @entity17 nation an @entity20 logo is seen outside a store warehouse in @entity33 south of @entity34			1
the @entity36 company has had an estimated profit of $ 1.01 billion in profits in @entity23 since 2003 , but has only paid $ 31 million in tax @entity10 director @entity40 said the companies featured in the documents – including @entity23 companies @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 – all used different tax structures			1
' the emphasis is that all of this is perfectly legal , no one is breaking any laws here , ' mr @entity40 told @entity57			1
' @entity8 is n't seen as a tax haven , it 's seen as a first - world country			2

' mr @entity40 said the global corporations use @entity8 to reduce billions of dollars in taxes , often by setting up subsidiaries or separate entities in the country			2
between 2002 and 2013 : ' the idea of doing this all legally is to make sure your profits are being earned in a place where you 're being taxed the least , ' he said			0
' so if you are taxed 10 percent in @entity23 , you want to earn the money somewhere else where the rate is one percent or less			0
' so you might set up an entity in @entity8 that lends your @entity23 company money at a high percentage , and then what happens there is you 're shifting the profit because the @entity23 company has to pay interest rates to @entity8			1
' mr @entity40 said @entity8 received a small percentage of the money but for the country ' it is about volume '			2
