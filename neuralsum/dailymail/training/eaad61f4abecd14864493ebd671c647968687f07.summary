the @entity0 has received a series of complaints over a recent on - air outburst by @entity5 quarterback @entity4 , even though none of it was audible			1
and the @entity9 star is n't happy about it			0
the fiery 37 - year - old unleashed several f - bombs toward the end of the november 30 game against the @entity15 , after it became apparent his team was set to lose			1
while it was obvious @entity4 was cursing the notorious four letter word , it was not picked up by microphones during the national broadcast by both @entity23 and @entity24			1
however that did not stop at least three viewers filing official complaints with the @entity0			1
at issue was the fact children watching the game could easily lip read and understand what @entity4 was screaming out			1
' i understand the first time it happened that the camera man would not have expected that , but to keep the camera on @entity4 as he kept yelling was uncalled for			2
' another complainer added : ' they clearly knew he was saying it and so did my 10 - year - old son … it was almost as if the announcers got away with it , because they did n't actually say it			2
' third complainant , an @entity59 parent , wrote that their ' six - year - old children know how to read lips even if there is no sound '			1
@entity4 has since addressed the situation , and said it was not his fault			2
he explained that @entity9 players are n't ' choirboys ' and that upset viewers should ' blame @entity23 and @entity24 for putting it on tv '			0
hitting back : quarterback @entity4 warms up before the @entity9 game against the @entity15 at @entity73 on november 30 , 2014 in @entity15 , @entity74 ' i wish i did have a better mouth out there at times , but there 's nothing that quite expresses the way i feel like that word , ' @entity4 said monday on @entity83			1
' it is , it is ( a great word ) , especially in the heat of the moment … blame @entity23 and @entity24 for putting it on tv			0
' do n't blame me			0
we 're not choirboys , i know that			0
' you bring us up to a certain level of intensity to the game , you 're job is to go out there and physically , emotionally , mentally dominate the game ' ' you do n't do that at church on sunday			0
you 've got to go to the football field for that			0
