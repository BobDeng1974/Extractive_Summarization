by @entity0 a stunning visualization from a @entity4 master 's student shows how the middle class have been pushed almost completely out of the @entity6 in only a few decades			1
@entity7 has created a series of maps dating back to 1970 show the rapidly expanding upper class on the traditionally well - off @entity11 and the explosion of poverty on historically poorer @entity14			1
the public policy major said the maps posted to his personal website are meant to show that the entrenchment of wealth in the @entity21 and on the @entity11 , and of poverty elsewhere , may only be part of a cycle that has seen neighborhoods change radically in only a few years			2
scroll down for animation what once was : @entity6 's wealth was mainly confined to the @entity11 and far northern outskirts in the 1970s , and a large middle class lived throughout the city - but poverty begins to take hold as the 1980s wear on rising gap : the growth in the 1990s of wealth was matched by a rise in poverty , but larger amounts of wealth started concentrating in @entity40 ( dark green ) while the rest of the city began to struggle as it is today : staggering amounts of wealth exist on the @entity11 and shocking poverty persists to the south and west of the neighborhoods in green the maps are ‘ not merely to depress you ( you ’re welcome ! ) , but to suggest just how dramatically the reality of @entity6 ’s ‘ two cities ’ has changed over the last few generations , how non-eternal its present state is , and that a happier alternate reality is n’t just possible , but actually existed relatively recently , ’ said @entity57			1
they are based on census tracts and use historical data compiled from a variety of sources , @entity57 disclosed on the blog spot			0
@entity64 , representing wealth , was always present in the @entity40 neighborhood stretching from the @entity66 to a few blocks west of @entity68			0
as the decades wear on , less prosperous residents are seen pushed out of the @entity11 , slowly at first , but then further and further west until they are barely part of the city			2
@entity6 ’s reputation as a violent city comes without qualification , but that violence is nowhere to be seen from @entity79 , the neighborhood surrounding the iconic @entity81 ballpark , all the way to the downtown area referred to as @entity82			1
recent developments including @entity84 and countless condo buildings in the area have turned @entity82 from the ghost town it was after office hours to the vibrant upper - class neighborhood it is now			2
tale of two cities : wealthy @entity94 have taken over @entity82 and @entity11 while the rest of the city has sunk deeper into poverty @entity64 , which at its darkest shade represents incomes at 200 % or higher than the metro median , stretches further and further west from @entity103 into even the @entity21 , which has recently undergone explosive growth as warehouses have been converted to loft apartments			1
@entity57 refers to this as ‘ the ever - widening ghetto of the affluent ’ and says that ‘ radically exclusionary housing laws ’ have made it possible			0
the rest of the map shows a virtual explosion of poverty , especially on the @entity14			2
the area ’s incomes were either just below , above or at the median for the city as recently as 1970 , but poverty begins to take hold in the 1980s and only tightens its grip as the decades wear on			0
pale shades of orange representing struggling families give way to blocks of red paint a picture of shocking despair			0
affluent ghetto : new development was spurred in @entity82 by @entity84 thriving : @entity6 's @entity11 , especially the area around @entity68 , has always been a relatively prosperous neighborhood , but recent decades have seen that prosperity explode what was once a working - class neighborhood has turned into drug - addled , crime ridden slums that rank among the most dangerous in the nation and have been dramatized in the @entity141 series ‘ @entity142			1
’ there are exceptions to each , pockets of relative prosperity , but the overall trend is downward as most middle class families are pushed further and further out into the suburbs and impoverished ones are hopelessly marooned in less prosperous areas			1
going west from the lake is no better			0
a short 20 minute drive from the bankers and academics on the @entity11 and in @entity82 , especially along @entity157 and @entity158 , transitions from industrial areas to poor , lower class households			2
shameless : the hit @entity141 series is set on @entity6 's @entity14 and chronicles the life of an impoverished family struggling in the poor neighborhood the area west of @entity168 has not fared well , nor have the other neighborhoods immediately along the @entity170 , a main @entity172 artery just to the south			1
‘ the obvious and immediate reaction to these maps is to see them as a direct consequence of rising income inequality , ’ wrote @entity57 , but he thinks something else is at play			0
‘ income segregation has actually risen faster than inequality , ’ he believes , or , in other words , purchasing power from working class incomes has continued to fall as the upper class increasingly continues to prosper			0
the solution , as @entity57 sees it , is through housing laws aimed at bringing down the barriers to migration that have gone up over the years .			0

@entity6 's once *sizeable* middle class has been pushed almost entirely out of the city since the 1970s
wealthy @entity94 have concentrated on the @entity11 and in @entity82
crime and poverty have overrun the @entity14 and @entity200
