playing with @entity0 turned @entity1 into the @entity3 's top goal scorer last season			1
the duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat , with the @entity10 scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league 's golden boot			1
doing it again might be a lot tougher			0
@entity0 , the @entity17 international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league , has retired and @entity1 is going to have to go through an adjustment period			1
@entity1 ( left ) did n't have a shot in the @entity24 ' season opener against @entity25 @entity0 retired at the end of the season meaning @entity1 has a new strike partner the @entity24 have revamped their roster and @entity0 is n't the only one gone			1
@entity31 international @entity30 has departed along with fellow midfielder @entity32			0
in the season opening tie against @entity25 , @entity1 did n't have a shot			1
' i do n't have to readjust my game , ' the 30 - year - old @entity10 said after the @entity24 practiced for their home opener against @entity38 on sunday			1
' i am always going to play the same way i always have			0
the players that have come in , i 'm trying to learn like i did with @entity0			2
i learned how he played and i learned to play off him			0
i 'll try to do the same with the new guys			0
' the additions this season are midfielders @entity46 and @entity48 and striker @entity49			2
but in the 1 - 1 season - opening draw , the chemistry was lacking up front			0
' on the day of the game i put a lot of it down to me , ' @entity1 said			2
' i was a bit too eager to get behind			0
i could have done a little bit better with my runs			0
it 's the first game , i do n't really lose my mind after a first game of the season			1
' if there is a difference this season it 's the style of the @entity24 ' play under new coach @entity67			1
there is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing			0
a lot went through @entity0 in past seasons			2
the @entity24 drew 1 - 1 with @entity25 in their first @entity3 game of the season ' for us , it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like @entity0 on the team , ' @entity24 captain and midfielder @entity76 said			1
' he was a little of a wild card , a joker			0
if you are losing or in a bad situation , you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened , which more often than not did			0
i think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that 's going to be a big shift this season			2
@entity76 said the team could have helped @entity1 more in the opening game			2
' we did n't create enough chances for @entity1 , ' @entity76 said			1
' i think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs			0
that is the thing that is going to make us successful this season			0
@entity1 is n't heading into the season thinking : how does he top last year ? he has set a goal target that he is not disclosing			1
if he meets it , he 'll set another one			0
whatever he does , @entity1 is n't interested in heading back to @entity10 , where he played for @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 before coming to the @entity24 in july 2013			1
' i do n't want to go back to @entity118			1
i 've said that several times , ' @entity1 said			2
' there were one or two whispers that i heard about but it does n't interest me			0
i 'm playing for the @entity24 and i love living in @entity124			2
' @entity1 says he has no desire of coming back to @entity10 and is enjoying life in the @entity127			1
