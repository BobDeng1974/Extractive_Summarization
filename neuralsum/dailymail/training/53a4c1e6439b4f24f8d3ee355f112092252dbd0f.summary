the @entity16 also insisted on returning from the election in the minibus rather than in a special papal car pope @entity7 has already displayed his intentions to remain humble and connected to the people ' he then stopped in the office , greeted everyone and decided to pay the bill for the room ... because he was concerned about giving a good example of what priests and bishops should do			1
' @entity7 is already winning plaudits for his down - to - earth manner			1
he has so far refused a motorcade and the official papal @entity58 for official business			0
and even on the night of the election he insisted on accompanying the other cardinals back to their lodgings , by mini bus , saying : ’ i came on the bus , so i ’ll go home on the bus			2

during his first @entity83 since being elected as supreme pontiff , @entity7 and his cardinals were dressed in simple yellow robes over their cassocks , rather than the formal ceremonial outfits they would normally wear on such a major occasion			1
speaking in @entity101 without notes , he said : ' we can walk all we want , we can build many things , but if we do n't proclaim @entity105 , something is wrong			0

we are worldly , ' he said ' we may be bishops , priests , cardinals , popes , all of this , but we are not disciples of the @entity110 , ' he said			0
it was a far simpler message than the dense , three - page discourse @entity141 delivered in @entity142 during his first @entity83 as pope in 2005			2
