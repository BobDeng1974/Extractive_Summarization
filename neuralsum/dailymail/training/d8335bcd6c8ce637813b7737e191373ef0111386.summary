the only thing i 'll be happy with is when @entity30 is defeated , ' @entity39 said on thursday			0
' the next " @entity10 " is on the way			0
' @entity20 had a privileged upbringing which included earning a computer science degree from @entity46			0

it 's very frightening to me '			0
mrs @entity11 added : ' we need to forgive him for not having a clue what he was doing			1
' mr @entity1 said he would not dwell on the background of his son 's killer			1
' in all fairness , discovering who he is might be important to some people but it 's certainly not important to me , ' he said outside the forum , according to @entity69			0

and then @entity2 hostage families can be respected and our government can treat us with some honesty '			1
the @entity73 echoed the sentiments of the family of @entity109 , a young international aid worker who recently was killed while held captive by militants ms @entity109 's family said in an interview on @entity113 's ' today ' that @entity2 government policies were contradictory and prevented the 26 - year - old from @entity116 , @entity75 , from being rescued			2
