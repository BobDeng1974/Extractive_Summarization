the racehorse had made headlines three years earlier when he became the first to win a race without wearing horseshoes			0
he had retired from racing by the time ms @entity2 , now 21 , took him and she had not ridden for some time - but she says the stables assured her it would be fine			1
she lost control as the horse gathered speed and fell on to wooden fencing around the riding arena , breaking her back			1
ms @entity2 had surgery to stabilise her severed spinal cord but remains paralysed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair			1
she is now suing the stables of @entity33 , where she was working at the time of the accident			0
the stables , founded by entrepreneur @entity37 , are the home of leading @entity40 trainer @entity39 , 34			0
ms @entity2 , of @entity41 , @entity13 , has made a claim with the @entity43 which details her accident			1

painful : ms @entity2 fell through a fence and broke her back after she lost control of the horse injured : ms @entity2 says the stables told her she ' would be fine ' riding the history - making racehorse but the horse quickly went from a walk to a trot and the teenager was unable to control him as he accelerated further			1
she lost her right stirrup and started to panic as the horse began galloping even faster			0
one of the stable staff tried to stop him by waving her arms , but it failed to work and ms @entity2 lost her other stirrup and was thrown from the saddle			2
mr @entity45 claims @entity77 breached its own health and safety policy by allowing her to ride in the circumstances , without the horse being led by a rope			2
he alternatively claims that the horse had suffered an attack of an equine condition known as ‘ the strangles ’ some weeks earlier which would have made him resistant to being ridden			2
the allegations have yet to be tested in court			0
no one was available for comment at the stables			0
in a statement released today , @entity91 said : ' @entity2 's accident was a terrible tragedy			1
' @entity2 was well liked on the yard and good with the horses , although she never rode for us - the accident had nothing to do with her work			2
' @entity77 is a close knit team and we have kept @entity2 on the payroll			0
' we have always hoped she might be able to come back to work for us in a different role but at this point in her recovery she has n't felt able to talk to us about that			0
' you will appreciate that because @entity2 has brought court proceedings and solicitors are involved , there is a limit to what we can say to the press but despite our deep sympathy for @entity2 's serious injuries , what happened was a riding accident and any criticism of our staff is not justified			1

@entity2 was just 17 when she broke her back by falling on to a fence
