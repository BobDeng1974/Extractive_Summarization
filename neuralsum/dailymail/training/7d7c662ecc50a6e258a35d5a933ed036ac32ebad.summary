migrant parents care more about their children ’s education than those from white working - class backgrounds , @entity1 ’s chief said yesterday			1
sir @entity7 attacked the mothers and fathers who failed to support their youngsters with homework and reading after school			1
pupils from migrant , black and @entity16 families were getting more backing at home – and it is helping them outperform their white classmates , he said			2
sir @entity7 told the @entity22 ’s today programme : ‘ family is important and we need to send a message out to parents that they need to support their children			1
sir @entity7 , a former head teacher , suggested immigrant families cared more about their children 's education than white working class @entity31 there are parts of our communities – particularly people from immigrant groups , ethnic minority groups , where their children are doing fantastically well because their parents support them			1
’ former head teacher sir @entity7 has previously called for parents to be fined for not helping children with their homework			1
reiterating the demand yesterday , he said : ‘ if parents do n’t support their children and do badly there should be sanctions			0
' i think it ’s important that families and parents support the school			2
’ his comments tally with a recent commons ’ education select committee report warning that the under - achievement of white working - class pupils is ‘ quite staggeringly low ’			1
research last year by the @entity59 revealed that in 2012 , only 26 per cent of poor white @entity61 boys gained five a * to c grades at gcse including @entity64 and maths			1
but 40 per cent of black boys achieved the same result , against a country - wide figure of 63 per cent			0
and earlier this week an immigrant mother wrote in the @entity71 how @entity16 values could prevent indigenous @entity61 children performing badly by understanding how learning can pave the way to a better life			2
later yesterday , at the @entity77 at @entity78 , @entity79 , sir @entity7 warned that thousands of pupils were being let down by the ‘ baleful legacy ’ of trendy teaching methods and poor discipline at ‘ bog standard ’ comprehensives			1
the pervasiveness of 1960s and 70s teaching methods meant state secondaries were associated with ‘ mediocrity , laxity and failure ’ , he said			0
its fallout could be seen in the toleration of poor behaviour , the ‘ disdain ’ for competitive sports and the ‘ half - hearted pursuit ’ of high academic standards			2
singling out the once - fashionable concept of ‘ individualised learning ’ – the belief that criticism and adult supervision stifle youthful creativity – he said : ‘ its legacy still lingers in some schools today : academic rigour is undervalued ; basic literacy and numeracy are neglected ; subject specialism is relegated in favour of cross-curricula muddle			0
’ weak head teachers who remain resistant to academic rigour and the importance of tests were also attacked			0
sir @entity7 insisted that good leadership was essential in ‘ the battle against tired ideologies and harmful classroom practices ’			2
head teachers must insist that the curriculum is ‘ academically robust ’ and confront parents who refuse to take responsibility for their children , such as flouting uniform rules			0
he now wants to ‘ reclaim the comprehensive ideal ’ , insisting that it is the only approach to ‘ address the educational needs of the entire country ’			0
he added : ‘ phrases such as “ behaviour management ” are still bandied around as if a child ’s conduct is something to be negotiated			0
it smacks of compromise and containment			0

sir @entity7 says bad parents should be fined to raise standards
says immigrant families and ethnic minorities outperforming white @entity61
suggests this is because white working - class parents do *n't* care as much
@entity1 chief also calls on state comprehensives to copy elite private schools
