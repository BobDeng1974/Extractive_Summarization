and suddenly , it ’s all about @entity1 again			1
it ’s the weekend of @entity4 ’s @entity3 ( @entity5 ) as the meeting of @entity8 and @entity9 jousts with @entity11 v @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity13 v @entity14 for the title of @entity16 ’s classic @entity3			1
the @entity4 match wo n’t win that title but this ‘ @entity3 ’ carries extra spice because @entity9 , revitalized by @entity21 ’s eccentricities , are top of @entity23 and @entity8 , vitalized by their owners ’ billions , lie second			1
@entity1 watches midweek @entity26 tie between @entity8 and @entity27 thus , with all the timing of a thespian ‘ luvvy ’ , @entity1 is suddenly ready for curtain up and is vying for centre stage			1
he has not scored since august , nor played since september and a couple of weeks ago @entity33 ’s medic was hinting that we are beginning to see @entity1 ’s tired body call for surrender			1
but , as his autobiography declares : ‘ i am @entity1 ’			2
on thursday he did light training , on friday he put in a group session and , suddenly , ahead of sunday 's @entity42 grudge match , the buzz is all about ‘ will he start ? ’ and ‘ will he win the match with a trademark goal to put @entity47 within a point of the leaders ? ’ all of which is like a scorpion down the underpants for @entity54 @entity53			2
from the moment they shared a club , the @entity58 has been dr @entity59 to @entity60 — not so much second fiddle as no fiddle , no music and no groupies			0
in @entity66 ’s 4 - 3 - 3 formation , @entity1 stomps the central turf and @entity53 must play wide			1
there is no question who is team leader , who must receive the best passes and the most scoreable crosses			0
@entity1 ( right ) has not played since september because of a heel inury yet while the @entity74 has been out , @entity53 has been a brilliant understudy , emphasizing why he , or perhaps @entity1 given his age and injuries , must move on			1
@entity53 scored the only goal in each of @entity47 ’s @entity79 wins over @entity80 in the @entity26			2
domestically , too , he has filled the @entity1 - vacuum but it took him time to hit his most clinical form , given that playing out of position has eroded his confidence			2
nor has he enjoyed the best of luck			0
celebrating with his ‘ rifleshot ’ pose after scoring a penalty at @entity91 , the referee booked him ( even though @entity53 has done that every time he has scored for years without punishment )			2
when @entity53 questioned the decision , he was sent off , thus missing another @entity1 - free game to firm up his claim to the centre - forward role			1
it ’s a dilemma — one which will probably be resolved with @entity53 starting in the middle on sunday and @entity1 on the bench			1
but it has caused much comment among those who know or just appreciate the vastly talented @entity58			0
former @entity105 midfielder @entity104 points out : ‘ prior to @entity1 being out , i think @entity53 lost a bit of confidence , which caused flaws in his game			1
@entity53 has taken the chance to stake his claim for the central striking role ‘ he struggled with self - doubt and it ’s difficult to be asked to do something extremely difficult — remain in @entity1 ’s shadow yet be prepared to replace him from time to time			1
’ two further parts of the problem are that @entity53 was brutally expensive to buy from @entity119 — the € 64m outlay helping to cause @entity8 ’s @entity120 problems			1
he has also had domestic strife to cope with			0
never an aid to a ‘ confidence ’ player			0
former @entity129 @entity128 striker @entity127 is a huge fan of @entity53 but is pessimistic about his future at @entity8			1
‘ @entity53 ’s struggling with the 4 - 3 - 3 formation but @entity47 ’s too big a club to expect them to change to suit him , ’ he says			2
‘ he has to adapt			0
@entity1 ’s a phenomenon — better than @entity53			1
if @entity53 ’s really miserable , he should leave			2
’ @entity66 , architect of the move to 4 - 3 - 3 , says : ‘ @entity1 is n’t an easy man to manage but then nobody is			2
the guy is exceptional and there are others much less able than him who are far more demanding ’			0
on @entity53 struggling when the @entity74 takes his favourite position , @entity66 says : ‘ it ’s bound to be just a passing phase because scoring goals is in this guy ’s blood			0
’ from @entity151 , the chorus of disapproval intensifies			0
before hitting the big time at @entity119 , @entity53 starred at @entity153 whose owner @entity157 rants : ‘ @entity47 deserve a coach of the highest level and i ’d give @entity66 6.5 out of 10			0
if he was n’t @entity4 , he ’d never have been put in charge			0
they have to go to 4 - 4 - 2			0
’ all music to @entity21 ’s ears			0
‘ @entity163 ’ for the @entity164 .			0

@entity9 are top of @entity23 and rivals @entity8 lie second in the table
@entity1 set to return after *recovering* from heel injury
@entity53 may be forced to play out wide in @entity5
