it is one of the most enduring and baffling crime mysteries of modern times : the disappearance and murder of candy heiress @entity6			1
the horse - loving @entity6 , who inherited a multi-million dollar fortune from her husband , @entity9 , vanished in 1977 , following a visit to a clinic in @entity12 , for a routine medical check up			1
no - one has ever been convicted in connection with her disappearance			1
but now recently revealed documents , and the claims of a former federal investigator , show that there is evidence and testimony that may finally solve the mystery			0
@entity25 , it is alleged in the documents , was kidnapped , beaten , shot and her body disposed of in a steel furnace , on the orders of a notorious @entity31 horse dealer			1
he opened a candy store and factory in @entity38 , the building used in the 2008 film @entity47 treats : the company 's first product was caramels , but they are best known for their candy corn the heiress , 65 when she disappeared and a dealer in horses herself , had stumbled into the dark underbelly of the trade , discovered major fraud and , it was feared by the plotters , was going to tell all			1
it was an insurance fraud , where highly - prized horses , many of them show jumpers , were killed for cash			1
a new book who killed the @entity70 ? by @entity71 and published by @entity72 has brought together all the evidence â€“ and sheds doubt on the involvement of the one man serving a prison sentence linked to the murder , @entity25 's lover , a sweet - talking conman called @entity37			1
@entity37 , now 85 , is in a federal prison in @entity82 serving a 30 - year sentence			1
he pleaded guilty to a federal racketeering charge , being part of an ongoing conspiracy to cheat elderly women out of their money			0
but , in an unusual sentencing hearing in 1995 , the judge agreed to hear claims from prosecutors of his involvement in the murder of @entity6			1
and the judge agreed , on the preponderance of evidence rather than beyond reasonable doubt , that @entity37 was involved in her disappearance and murder			1
on that basis , the judge handed down the 30 year sentence , 20 for his alleged involvement in @entity25 's murder			1
@entity25 's disappearance nearly three decades ago continues to fascinate			1
the former hat check girl from @entity107 , a beauty in her youth , was 38 when she met and married then 60 - year - old @entity110 , who died in 1971			2
founded in @entity38 in 1904 by @entity9 's father , @entity112 , the brand was arguably best known through its jingle ' stop where you are , buy a @entity25 's candy bar '			1
following the death of her husband , and living alone in her home on the north shore of @entity38 , @entity25 began to get involved in selling and buying horses			1
and this was how she stumbled into a world of deeply unsavory characters involved in fraud , implicated in murder and with links to the @entity132			2
it was also how she met the smooth - talking conman named @entity37			1
@entity71 , a @entity38 - based author , has been following the story for some 15 years , driven by the belief that @entity37 had nothing to do with the disappearance , or murder , of @entity25			1
' the reason i was fascinated is because it 's a story with everything , ' @entity71 said			0
' it 's got bad guys , commen , gigolos , horse thieves , an heiress , money and murder			2
this makes it a complicated story because there are so many characters , you could not make them up			0
' @entity71 writes : ' @entity37 is an interesting character , a born conman			2
' when he met the widow @entity25 in the mid 70s , he was already middle - aged and quite the lothario			1
' he has a particular quality that things will always be better around the corner			0
he was friendliest , brightest inmate i have ever interviewed			0
' @entity71 has interviewed @entity37 in prison a number of times over the past 15 years			2
' he 's not a good guy but one thing i do not think he is , is a murderer			0
' @entity71 believes , based on the recently revealed documents obtained by the author and interviews with a former federal investigator , that @entity25 became a victim of a sinister ' horse mafia ' that operated for decades in the @entity31 area			1
for much of that time it was led by an individual named @entity180 , the head of a family of horse dealers			0
@entity183 , who died in the mid 1980s , was implicated in a series of murders , and convicted of conspiracy to murder his own brother			1
@entity183 is a central figure in the files detailing what two senior investigators , @entity192 , recently retired from the @entity193 , and @entity194 , of the @entity197 state 's attorney 's office , believe happened			0
the files were produced following an investigation carried out ten years ago after an individual named @entity201 came forward with claims he knew exactly how @entity25 was killed and her body disposed of			1
horsing around : all fingers point to @entity180 as the man who was responsible for @entity25 's disappearance and death , says the author			1
his motive : @entity6 had discovered his insurance fraud scheme guilty ? @entity6 's houseman @entity212 , appeared at a probate hearing in 1984 to determine if @entity25 should be declared legally dead			1
but he was implicated in @entity25 's disappearance by an eyewitness @entity201 , who alleged he was part of the gang that kidnapped and killed @entity25 , implicates @entity183 , claiming the notorious horse dealer ordered @entity25 's murder from his prison cell , where he was serving time for conspiracy to murder his brother , @entity201 named names of those involved in the plot , a motley , and pretty nasty , crew including @entity25 's long time house man @entity212 , long a prime suspect in her disappearance			1
@entity201 is still alive and living in @entity82			0
two others , @entity231 , and @entity232 , the police officer , are also still living			0
neither of the two would speak to the author			0
plemmons tale , and the painstaking efforts of investigators to independently verify his claims , is laid out in gruesome detail in the files produced by the investigation but only recently revealed			0
@entity25 was targeted after she threatened to reveal to authorities details of a major fraud involving horses orchestrated by @entity180			2
horses were bought and insured , then killed for the insurance money			2
the elderly heiress was beaten , shot point blank and her body disposed of in a blast furnace in an @entity256 steel plant , according to @entity201			0
crucially , @entity71 argues , @entity37 is not implicated in the gruesome plot			2
his name does not appear in the files , but following the investigation , no further action was taken by prosecutors			0
@entity263 : @entity6 got involved in the horse trade and came across a scheme run by mobsters where horses were bought , insured and then killed for the insurance money innocent : the author has been following the case for some 15 years , driven by the belief that @entity37 had nothing to do with the disappearance , or murder , of @entity25 the home where @entity6 lived in @entity38 @entity192 , the former @entity193 agent deeply frustrated at the failure to pursue the prosecution following @entity201 ' 2005 revelations , said there was still a chance , probably the last , to solve this great crime mystery			1
@entity192 told @entity71 : ' there is no secret to the @entity25 case			2
we know how , we know why and we know where			0
i 'll go to my grave knowing that we had it done			0
' @entity71 believes @entity37 was the victim of a system and federal prosecutors who wanted the crime solved			2
he believes that @entity37 should be released from the @entity297 federal correction institution , not least because of his age			0
' he long ago served his 10 years for fraud			0
the extra time was a sentence for the @entity25 murder			2
but he 's served enough even on that			0
the fact is they were wrong to add that time			0
' @entity71 believes if @entity37 knew anything of the murder he would long ago have revealed everything			0
' even if somewhat damaging to him , he would have played that card a long time ago and blamed anybody if he could have			0
' @entity71 added : ' @entity37 is not the hero by any stretch but the @entity312 wanted to solve this case and going after @entity37 was the only way to do that			2
' who killed the @entity70 ? by @entity71 and published by @entity72 is available on @entity317			0

@entity6 's husband , the scion of @entity38 's @entity320 died leaving her a *multi-mllion* fortune
in 1977 the widow . who had taken up with well - known lothario @entity37 , vanished without a trace
@entity6 got involved in the horse trade and came across a scheme run by mobsters
highly - prized horses were insured and then killed for cash
@entity37 was convicted of racketeering but the judge added decades to his sentence believing he was implicated in @entity6 's disappearance
an eyewitness has come forward claiming the @entity340 murdered @entity25 and tossed her body
