the head of a maraschino cherry factory who shot himself dead last tuesday after police found a secret drug lab on site could have been making up to $ 10million a year from his illicit venture			1
@entity7 , 57 , president of @entity10 's @entity9 factory in @entity11 , was believed to have been managing a huge marijuana operation on the side of his food business			1
according to a report in the the @entity16 , he could have earned up to $ 6,500 for a pound of the substance - depending on the quality			1
it has been claimed he could have been making up to $ 10million a year the smell of the 400,000 pounds of cherries produced each day in his factory hid the smell of the 1,200 plants he grew @entity7 asked his sister @entity30 ( right ) to ' take care of [ his ] kids ( two daughters @entity33 and @entity35 and ex-wife @entity36 left ) , ' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom if he was growing 100 plants and the drug was ' high quality ' , it means he would have been making more than $ 2.5million every three months , a consultant told @entity43			1
it was revealed on saturday that he was able to keep investigators in the dark as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of @entity9 his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the marijuana plants			1
reports suggest he was capable of growing at least 100 at a time , but could have managed up to 1,200 , meaning he could have been making substantially more from the criminal enterprise			0
furthermore , the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation			2

all that , along with 120 expensive grow lamps , were completely hidden , leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company			0
' in theory , it could have been him and outsiders , ' said the source			0
' this is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees wo nâ€™t know			0
' despite all this , the company , which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , is back in business and family lawyer @entity115 states managers are cooperating fully with the @entity118 's investigation			0
