by @entity0 published : 18:24 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 18:24 est , 16 may 2012 thousands of students are gaining degrees with relatively little work despite record numbers of firsts being handed out each year , a study shows			1
they are managing to graduate from some universities by putting in ‘ much less effort ’ than that demanded on degree courses at other more prestigious institutions			1
the @entity12 has warned that the finding raises an ‘ uncomfortable question ’ about degree standards			1
thousands of students are gaining degrees with relatively little work despite record numbers of firsts being handed out each year , a study shows its report , @entity21 at @entity22 , comes as the number of graduates awarded first class degrees has soared by almost 50 per cent over the last five years			1
however critics have also accused universities of failing to provide value for money since the trebling of tuition fees to £ 3,000 in 2006 has not impacted on the amount of teaching students receive or the size of group tuition			1
@entity37 surveyed over 9,000 first and second year students in @entity40 universities			1
it found that ‘ in almost all subjects ’ , students in pre- 1992 red - brick universities devoted more time to their work than students in ‘ new ’ universities - former polytechnics and specialist colleges			1
for example , in medicine and dentistry , students at pre- 1992 universities have a total workload of 37.3 hours a week on average - including teaching and private study - compared to 34.5 hours in post- 1992 institutions			1
in veterinary science , students at red brick universities devote 37.9 hours a week to work compared to 27 hours at former polytechnics while law students spend 31 hours and 26.5 hours respectively at the different institutions			2
however , there are also big differences between the amounts of effort required in different subjects			2
the number of graduates awarded first class degrees has soared by almost 50 per cent over the last five years in ‘ mass communications and documentation ’ which includes media studies , students have a total workload of just 18.1 hours a week in older universities and 20.4 hours in newer universities			2
the average of 20.1 hours across all these institutions is akin to ‘ part - time ’ employment , whereas studying for medicine and dentistry is the equivalent of a ‘ full - time job ’			2
the report says the policy question that needs to be addressed ‘ is what it says about a @entity88 degree , if students can obtain degrees which are held to be comparable , while devoting very different amounts of effort to their studies ’			1
the think - tank carried out similar surveys in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 and discovered that students in @entity40 universities ‘ by and large ’ devote ‘ far less effort ’ to work than students in most other @entity101 countries			2
speaking ahead of the latest report ’s publication , @entity102 , @entity37 ’s director , said he suspected that students with degrees from this country ’s universities ‘ do n’t have the depth of knowledge and understanding ’ that many of their overseas rivals have			0
his report says : ‘ our degrees are already shorter than those elsewhere			0
‘ it appears also that less effort is required by our students during each week of study			0
‘ this raises potentially awkward questions , and indeed these are being posed by our @entity101 partners and those who sponsor students from overseas			1
’ overall students reported an average of 13.9 hours of scheduled teaching per week across all types of institutions , compared to 14.2 hours in 2007 and 13.7 hours in 2006			0
students have been ‘ working a little harder ’ in their own time , reporting 14.4 hours of private study a week , compared to 12.7 in 2007 and 13.1 hours in 2006			0
the report says that in terms of the amount of teaching contact students have and the size of groups in which they are taught , the increase in fees in 2006 has led to ‘ no change ’ in provision			0
referring to the introduction of £ 9,000 - a - year fees this @entity146 , @entity147 , general secretary of the @entity148 , said : ‘ we are entering a very dangerous period for higher education			0
‘ students and their parents will expect more bang for the massively increased buck , but the reality is that universities simply can not deliver more for less			0
’ some 53,215 students gained firsts in 2010/11 ( 15.5 per cent ) compared to 36,645 in 2006/7 ( 12.6 per cent )			0
at the same time , 48.4 per cent of graduates - 166,100 - were awarded a respectable 2.1 in 2010/11 , with only seven per cent - 24,825 - finishing with a third class .			0
