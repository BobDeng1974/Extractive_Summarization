over 250 dolphins are being held captive in a cove on the coast of @entity3 , waiting for either a life in captivity , or slaughter			1
the bottlenose dolphins , including one young and very rare albino dolphin worth millions , will be kept until the brutal selection process of the aquarium industry begins on january 18			1
those that are n't taken to perform in shows will either face death by spear , or a gory corral back into the sea with their community much thinner and a lot weaker			0
within the captured pod there is a young albino bottlenose dolphin , who is likely to be kidnapped by the aquariums			1
albino bottlenose dolphins are extremely rare , and are worth considerable money to marine parks as spectator items and entertainment			1
the marine parks in @entity3 are modeled after the @entity65 aquarium industry that make millions of dollars using dolphins for extremely popular aquatic acrobatic shows			2
tradition : each year the fishermen capture and kill a huge amount of dolphins , putting the population at risk did she kill herself ? there is speculation that the mother of this albino dolphin trapped by @entity3 fishermen in a cove has committed suicide after being torn apart from her baby one of the crusaders from @entity84 , who hope to bring the dolphin 's plight to light ( left )			1
the fishermen preparing their nets to capture the next pod of dolphins ( right ) the albino dolphin is one of the rarest from this current batch of captured bottlenoses if the dolphins that escape captivity are not killed , they are ' driven ' back to the open ocean by ' banger boats ' that force them to travel out to sea using long poles attached to the sides of the boat			1
these poles are deployed above the water , and then the fishermen hit a flange on the top of the poles with a hammer , creating a cacophony that drives the dolphins back out to sea			0
this is the same tactic that the fisherman use to push the dolphins into the cove and capture them			0
heavy machinery : fishermen hoist a dolphin out of the sea , on its way to either lifetime captivity or death boat : ' @entity129 ' use poles and flanges to make unpleasant sounds , driving the dolphins to specific places preparation : fishermen and trainers unload the orange nets yesterday - just 24 hours before decision day ( @entity139 ) the fishermen are for the most part , a selection of fishermen from the @entity144			0
( @entity145 ) one of the dolphin fences inside the cove that allows the fishermen to stand watch those driven back to sea will likely be very young , and will not have the guidance of the elders that have been killed or captured , making them very unlikely to survive			2
because the process is being repeated every year , entire communities of migratory dolphins along the coast of @entity3 are being destroyed			0
the capturing and killing of the dolphins is mostly carried out by the @entity135 's union , who are being fought relentlessly by the @entity164			0
the dolphins will be uncomfortably oblivious of the impending doom some of them will suffer at the hands of the fishermen			0
they are captured around four to five at a time until enough of them are collected for ' selection ' treatment : the fishermen brutally kill the dolphins they do not set free or capture using a sharp spike or spear cramped : the cove does not provide much space for the dolphins to swim , forcing them to huddle up in groups			2

250 dolphins being held captive , waiting for slaughter by spike or captivity
they will meet their fate *tomorrow* , when the selection process begins
the *hunting* process was documented in the oscar winning film ' @entity49 '
albino bottlenose dolphins are the rarest and will be captured and sold
blame could lie with *burgeoning* @entity3 marine park industry
fishermen use brutal tactics to herd and capture the dolphins in the cove
the yearly killings mean the dolphin population is being *decimated*
elder dolphins are killed or captured , *meaning* they can not raise young
