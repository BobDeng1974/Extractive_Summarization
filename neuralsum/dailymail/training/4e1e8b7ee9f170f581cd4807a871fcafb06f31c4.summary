by @entity0 secretary of state for communities and local government @entity1 has confirmed that two ' garden cities ' could be built in the south east @entity1 has confirmed that two ' garden cities ' could be built in the south east in a bid to tackle @entity7 's housing crisis			1
the @entity8 insisted that they would not be forced on unwilling new communities , and said local councils had already come forward to express an interest			2
he insisted his department had not been responsible for drawing up a document , which was reported last week as proposing new settlements at @entity16 in @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity19			1
speaking on @entity22 's @entity21 programme , he said no decisions had been made on location			0
' let me be absolutely clear : i have not seen , formally or informally ... this report does not come from my department , ' he said			0
' we tend to be the experts in planning and housing so we would expect some degree of involvement			0
' i do n't rule out an ambitious civil servant from another department putting something together but both parties stood on a manifesto saying we would not force eco-towns or garden cities on the population			1
' mr @entity1 said land was being released by the coalition through the local infrastructure plan for housing and that plots for 100,000 homes would be available before the next election			2
and he added : ' it is important to set up settlements where there is going to be some infrastructure there , where there is going to be roads and the like			0
i think we could probably produce garden settlements , we could produce a garden city or two - provided it is in places where people want it and there are authorities expressing an interest			2
@entity16 : a draft proposal suggests new settlements in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity19 ' but it has to be on the basis of consent			1
after all , @entity71 promised five garden cities and produced none and when that failed to arrive they promised 10			1
all that happened with that policy was building resentment , not a single dwelling			0
' writing in the @entity80 last week , deputy prime minister @entity79 said : ' we can not make the mistakes of past governments and sit on our hands while a whole generation of people are squeezed out of the housing market			0
it is our duty to change the story			0
' we must bring decades of indecision and stagnant political will to an end			0
' that is why i am a strong advocate of garden cities , where there is clear local support and private sector appetite			1
in 2011 , our housing strategy committed us to publishing a prospectus for new garden cities and that is exactly what we 'll do			2
' @entity18 : a new settlement could be built in the @entity19 town			1

@entity1 has confirmed two ' garden cities ' could be built in the south east
settlements could be in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity19
