by @entity0 researchers in @entity2 could be on the verge of a medical breakthrough after pinpointing three types of stem cells in umbilical cord blood , which could be the key to preventing cerebral palsy			1
as part of a trial to prevent the disorder , babies in @entity11 will be given back their own umbilical blood , reported @entity16 cerebral palsy is a physical condition affecting posture and movement , due to damage to the developing brain during pregnancy or shortly after birth			1
new hope : a trail will see babies in @entity11 given back their own umbilical blood in a bid to prevent the cerebral palsy one @entity28 child every 15 hours is born with cerebral palsy according to @entity30			1
often caused by oxygen deprivation around the time of birth , about 700 @entity28 babies are born with cerebral palsy each year , making it the most common childhood physical disability			1
researchers at the @entity38 found that giving back umbilical cord blood to newborns within 12 hours of birth could prevent the likelihood of birth asphyxia , which causes brain damage			1
during the @entity46 of the @entity47 of @entity28 and @entity48 , scientist @entity45 revealed researchers were in the process of determining the link between umbilical cord blood and brain repair			1
the @entity54 at @entity38 , pictured , is leading the way in preventing the disorder ' cord blood works , but we want to know what ’s the best cord blood to give back , ' dr @entity45 said			2
' these particular cells can actually stop the inflammation which causes damage			0
they can help the baby ’s own brain repair itself , and help these blood vessels become stronger			0
' the @entity54 's research is focused on three types of stem cell and their characteristics : anti-inflammatory t - regulatory cells , endothelial progenitor cells , which stimulate blood flow to injured areas and the brain - repairing @entity78 stem cells			2
part of the team 's research involved taking umbilical cord blood from lambs and then isolating the specific stem cells			1
once this was done , the stem cells were then injected back into the animals 12 hours from the time of injury , dr @entity45 said			2
the results from the study will form the basis of a national human clinical trial , which will see babies at risk of cerebral palsy given the umbilical cord blood in the first few days after birth			1
mesenchymal stem cells , pictured , are one of the three singled out by researchers and are able to help fix damaged nervous tissue in the brain ' the results that are coming out of our studies and the clinical trials overseas are so promising			2
it ’s going to happen			0
it has so much potential , ' dr @entity45 said			0
the trial will be led by professor @entity111 and associate professor @entity112			0
in 2012 , a world - first trial at @entity115 saw pregnant women whose babies were not developing normally , given an antioxidant			0
doctors believed this was capable of stopping their babies from suffering brain damage in the womb and developing cerebral palsy , reported @entity125			0
research centres around the world are testing the success of stem cell therapies			0
in @entity131 , human clinical trials appear promising with children aged between six months and 10 years old , who received donated cord blood together with other rehabilitation therapies , showing improvements in cognitive function and motor skills .			0

a @entity11 trial will see babies given their own umbilical blood back
the process could prevent cerebral palsy
researchers are focusing on three types of stem cells in the cord blood
cerebral palsy is the most common childhood physical disability in @entity28
