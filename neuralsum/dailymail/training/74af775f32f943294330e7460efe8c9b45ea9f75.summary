@entity6 was swimming in his family 's pool in @entity10 , @entity11 on sunday when he received a jolt that threw him out of the pool
the light switch to the pool was not properly grounded , meaning power that should have been diverted from the pool was instead going in to it
the family had the light fixed about 9 months ago and now contractors face *questions* over what happened
