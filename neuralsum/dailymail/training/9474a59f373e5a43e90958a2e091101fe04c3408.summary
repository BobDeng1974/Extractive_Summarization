by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 13:41 est , 11 march 2013 a couple who routinely drugged their toddler daughter so they could ' catch up on their sleep ' have been given suspended prison sentences			1
the drug addict mother , 41 , and father , 40 , regularly gave their two - year - old daughter the liquid paracetamol @entity9 - intended for children more than twice her age - for a year and a half so she was less likely to wake in the night and disturb their sleep , a court heard			1
@entity20 @entity19 was told the little girl also sometimes had the sedative @entity22 - used to treat severe anxiety and agitation			1
the parents admitted cruelty after drugging their toddler with @entity9 so they could catch up on their sleep the girl had to be fed through a nasal tube when she was born due to problems caused by her mother 's use of @entity22 and the heroin substitute methadone while she was pregnant , the court heard			1
instead of weaning their daughter off the tube , the couple , from @entity37 in @entity38 , continued to use it routinely because it was easier for them , prosecutor @entity35 said			2
they went on to give her @entity45 on a nightly basis between the ages of two and a three and a half so they could sleep , he added			0
the little girl was taken into the care of an aunt in june 2011 after her ' plainly selfish ' parents , who met in rehab , told a social worker what they had been doing			1
judge @entity56 criticised the couple for their ' remarkably stupid ' actions , and told them he would have jailed them were it not for the fact it would deprive their daughter of weekly supervised visits from her parents			2
the parents , whose identities can not be revealed , walked free from court after being handed suspended sentences their offences were not malicious but they were quite plainly selfish to spare themselves the tribulations of parenthood , the judge said			1
' every parent of a young child will have undergone sleepless nights because the child is unsettled for one reason or another			0
you chose to adminster @entity9 , which was not intended for a child that age , and you chose to keep very quiet about it , ' he said			1
' i see before me a wholly inadequate man who was rather struggling with this child and a mother who was more concerned with herself than her child , ' the judge added			2
both parents admitted being cruel to their daughter between september 2009 and june 2011 by routinely administering medised - a liquid medicine typically prescribed to children between the ages of six and 12 to relieve cold and flu symptoms , fevers or headaches			2
her mother admitted a similar charge involving her daughter taking @entity22 , but denied that she had given it to her daughter deliberately			1
' plainly selfish ' : the mother , 41 , and father , 40 , were given suspended sentences at @entity109 the couple 's denial of a charge of administering methadone to their daughter was accepted by the prosecution			1
they had faced another charge of cruelty by using a feeding tube on the child , which was not proceeded with			0
judge @entity56 the woman was sentenced to 18 months suspended for a period of two years , while the man was given a 12 month sentence suspended for the same period			2
both were placed under a curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am for a period of six months			0
the court heard the couple 's daughter was eating normally within a month of being taken into care and had grown into a ' bright little button '			0
her parents have supervised access to their daughter at weekends			0
it might send the little girl ' off the rails ' if she were to be deprived of the visits , the judge said			2
her aunt said in a recent statement : ' she is a much loved , beautiful and bright little girl , surrounded by the people who love her deeply , especially her mum and dad			0
' @entity146 , representing the girl 's mother , said the couple met when they were both in rehab in 2001			1
' i am afraid they went badly wrong as parents , ' he said			0
@entity156 , representing her father , said : ' he thought that by giving @entity9 he was relieving her [ his daughter ] and relieving himself			1
he now recognises he was wrong and is ashamed			0
he loves his daughter dearly			0
' judge @entity161 told the couple that with their own drug addiction histories they should have known better and what they had done was ' most remarkably stupid '			0
he said the mother had show no real effort to address her own addictions and was still taking the highest prescription of methadone he had ever seen .			0
