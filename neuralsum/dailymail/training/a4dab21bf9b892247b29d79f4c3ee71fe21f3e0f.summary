families hitting the road for the half - term holiday face paying double for lunch at motorway services compared with supermarket prices , a study has revealed			1
the average picnic lunch for a family of four costs nearly £ 32 from service stations but is just over £ 15 from @entity11 , research by the supermarket found			1
some services charged as much as £ 2.40 for a bottle of water , while sandwiches , sweets , fizzy drinks and crisps were at least twice the normal price at the roadside			2
comparison : how supermarket prices compare with service stations researchers studied prices at the four biggest motorway services providers : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity29 and @entity32			1
they found hugely inflated prices , including bags of @entity36 selling for £ 2.99 in @entity31 , compared with £ 1 in @entity11 , and @entity38 sandwiches at nearly £ 4 in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity29 , compared with £ 2 in the supermarket			2
at a @entity30 on the @entity40 in @entity41 , a lunch consisting of a @entity38 sandwich , a standard - sized chocolate bar , a packet of crisps and a litre of water cost £ 8.33			0
the equivalent lunch would cost £ 4.05 – less than half the price – from the supermarket			0
other service stations also hiked prices , with the same lunch costing £ 8.18 at a @entity31 services on the @entity56 in @entity57 , £ 7.94 at a @entity29 in @entity58 and £ 7.06 at an extra on the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61			1
buying petrol from services could also cost around £ 10 a tank extra , with fuel costing up to 15p more per litre			0
services : the survey found that stations including @entity31 , pictured , were often twice as expensive as supermarkets busy : millions of drivers will take to the roads this weekend - and often end up stopping in service stations the study was published as the @entity74 predicted 17million cars would be on the roads over this @entity77 weekend , with monday being the busiest day of the year as it coincides with the start of half term			1
@entity81 , pricing expert at @entity11 , said : ‘ we recommend planning ahead and with the cash you save , treat the family to games or snacks to share or perhaps use the extra money to fill the car with fuel for your trip			0
‘ by pre-packing a lunch for the family , you could save yourself close to £ 100			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity95 said : ‘ there is no reason why fuel and food costs should be higher , other than these service stations have a monopoly and appear to charge whatever they like			1
’ prices in the survey relate to food on sale in @entity109 stores at @entity30 and @entity32 , @entity110 at @entity31 and @entity111 at @entity29			2
none of the four services providers could be contacted for comment last night			0
in the past they have defended their high prices by saying they run a wide variety of services 24 hours a day so have large overheads			0
