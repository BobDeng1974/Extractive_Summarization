@entity0 is alleged to have started a fire that three young children and a teenager a teenager died as he tried in vain to rescue his three younger siblings after a fire was started in a wardrobe , a court has heard			1
@entity16 , 19 , battled to get to his sisters , twins @entity10 and @entity11 , four , and their two - year - old brother , @entity12 , who were asleep at the time of the fire			1
but he was overcome by fumes as he went upstairs following the fire which was allegedly started by @entity0 , 19 , who is on trial for murder			1
@entity0 , who admitted to drinking neat vodka before the fire , was the only other person upstairs at the dormer bungalow in @entity25 , @entity26 , when the fire broke out as a birthday party was being held downstairs for the children 's mother , @entity29			1
prosecutor @entity31 told @entity32 : it is the prosecution 's case that the defendant , @entity0 , was responsible for starting that fire and he did so deliberately			1
' three family friends were also in the house along with the defendant who was a friend of another of ms @entity41 's sons			0
@entity0 was a regular visitor and stayed overnight the evening before the blaze , the jury was told			1
according to people in the house he spent most of the night on january 7 in the second upstairs bedroom , said mr @entity31			0
he continued : ' @entity41 had allowed @entity0 to store some of his personal belongings that were in a large blue @entity49 bag in bedroom one ( the young children 's room )			1
' the presence of that bag may be significant because it would provide a reason for @entity0 to go into that bedroom			1
' apart from the three young children who were asleep in their beds , he was the only person upstairs when the fire started and he was the person that alerted the other occupants of the house to what was happening			2
' mother - of - nine ms @entity41 , 37 , said she said remembered the lights going off and then the defendant jumped down the stairs and shouted ' @entity68 ' before he ran through the kitchen and out of the back door			2
@entity10 and @entity71 , aged four , were killed in the fire in @entity25 , @entity26 , in january this year mr @entity31 said : ' @entity41 's memory of subsequent events is understandably not clear but she recalls being taken out of the house and sitting on the little wall at the end of the driveway			1
' she does n't remember @entity16 going up the stairs but she remembers him being brought out and everyone gathering around him			1
' thereafter she was taken in a police car to the hospital where she discovered that four of her children had died in the fire			2
' ms @entity41 told police that smoke alarms had been fitted at the top and bottom of the stairs but @entity16 had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both of them kept making beeping noises			1
she said she took the twins up to bed at about 10pm to join @entity12 who was already asleep			1
the prosecutor said : ' she is sure that the doors to the wardrobe were closed when she left the room because it annoys her if they are left open so she always checks that they are closed and that the children 's dressing gowns are hanging from the handles			0
' @entity0 , from the @entity25 area , denies four counts of murder and four alternative counts of manslaughter			1
the court heard the recollection of most of the witnesses who attended the party was ' affected to some extent by drink and in some cases by drugs in the form of cannabis			0
' mr @entity31 said : ' in particular , most of the witnesses are unable to say with any certainty at what time various events occurred			0
' @entity16 ( right ) died as he tried to save his twin sisters and little brother @entity12 ( left ) , two it could be established though that the first 999 call to report a fire was made at 11.20pm by a neighbour			1
and that some time after 10.45pm one of the family friends , who was sober , went up to the bedroom where @entity0 was			1
he said the defendant appeared ' drunk and stoned ' after @entity0 had earlier told him was going to make a mix for a cannabis bong			1
when he returned downstairs there was a loud bang shortly after and all the lights in the house went off			0
in a witness statement given to police in the early hours of january 8 , @entity0 confirmed he was a friend of @entity16 and one of the victim 's younger brothers			1
he said he began celebrating ms @entity41 's birthday at lunchtime by drinking from a bottle of vodka			0
@entity0 said he was upstairs when the lights suddenly went out and he thought it was a power cut			1
he saw the children 's bedroom door was shut but he could see an ' orange glow ' in a gap at the bottom			0
' i opened the door to check and all of a sudden thick black smoke just hit me in the face , ' he said			0
i started shouting " fire , fire " straight away			2
' he said he told @entity16 there was a fire and to ' get those kids out '			1
he ran downstairs to rouse a person who had fallen asleep on the sofa and then ran outside			0
firefighters outside the house where the three children and a teenager were killed in january this year the morning after the fatal blaze the court heard that @entity16 was heard kicking at the door to the children 's bedroom as others escaped from the property			1
when police arrived at the bungalow the defendant was outside , and an officer asked him if he was all right			0
@entity0 replied : ' no i 'm not			1
please , i 'm worried about my friend @entity16			1
he went back in and upstairs for the babies			0
i tried to follow @entity16 upstairs to get the babies but the smoke was too thick			1
i 've got asthma and i could n't do it			0
' @entity16 was pronounced dead at the scene , while the three other children all died at @entity195 shortly after midnight , the court heard			1
post-mortem examinations concluded all four had died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by smoke inhalation			0
mr @entity31 told the jury that several ' extremely detailed investigations ' had taken place into the cause of the fire and the unanimous view of the experts was that it was started deliberately			2
one expert concluded the fire started in the hanging clothes in the wardrobe , and the most likely source of ignition was a naked flame			2
@entity0 said he saw an ' orange glow ' in a gap at the bottom of the door and that he ran down the stairs shouting ' fire , fire ' the fire was detected because of an electrical fault that caused the house electrics to trip out , he continued			1
and anyone who caused the fire would have seen the ignition and would have had ' ample opportunity ' to raise the alarm			2
the electrical fault occurred when the fire spread from the wardrobe to a lighting unit fitted to the ceiling of the room , the jury was told			2
by that time the fire would have already reached its maximum , said mr @entity31			2
forensic evidence showed the three children in the bedroom were likely to have been ' incapacitated very quickly ' but that @entity11 and @entity12 made attempts to escape			1
outside @entity242 , the defendant told a neighbour ' the electrics all cut off ' and ' we had to put candles up '			0
another neighbour told police she overheard @entity0 say : ' it was the candle			2
the electric went off and we put a candle in the room			0
i went upstairs and there was a glow and i felt the door and it was so hot i ran downstairs and rang the @entity257			0
' mr @entity31 told the jury : ' you may wish to consider whether what the defendant was saying suggests that he knew rather more about the start of the fire than he later told the police when he made his witness statement			0
' moreover , you will have noticed that what the defendant said does not fit with the sequence of events described by the experts - namely that the electricity went off as a result of , and not before , the fire			2
so there would have been no opportunity to put a candle in the bedroom because by then the fire would have been burning for between three and five minutes			0
' on january 10 the defendant went to a church memorial service in @entity242 for the @entity280			0
he later called at the @entity282 pub in the town with several others , said the prosecutor , where he was said to have told a friend : ' i do n't know what to do			0
i 'm leaving tomorrow and going to @entity290			0
' @entity0 was arrested the next day and then bailed pending further inquiries			2
police re-arrested him in december 2012 and found two ' interesting ' @entity294 conversations recovered from his laptop , said the prosecutor			0
in one of the chats he told a female @entity294 user : ' btw ( by the way ) this is what i did xxxxxx			0
well menna have done xxxxx			0
' he then sent her a website link to a newspaper article which detailed his arrest on suspicion of murder			0
@entity0 went on to maintain his innocence before police charged him with the four murders			2
the trial , which is scheduled to last up to eight weeks , continues tomorrow			0
