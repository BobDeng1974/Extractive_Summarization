the film told the story of a prim missionary and a gruff adventurer , the captain of the @entity2 - two totally different characters - who in true silver screen fashion end up falling in love despite the odds			2
@entity25 wrote a frothy account of the making of the @entity2 , which was shot between @entity26 and neighbouring @entity44 , subtitled ' how i went to @entity47 with @entity3 , @entity48 and @entity49 and almost lost my mind '			1

i 've travelled the full length of the river , from the @entity69 to the source in @entity71 , ' the father of three recounted			0

' back in the 1990s he set up a rafting company in @entity26 's @entity59 area , and then had an eco-lodge built on an island in the river			2
@entity8 says he wants his projects to be sustainable - from both an economic and an environmental point of view			0

' @entity8 learned of the existence of the @entity2 when on holiday on @entity109 's island of @entity110 , where traditional @entity112 - style sailing dhows with lateen sails are common			1
' i was looking for an authentic @entity47 boat to run on the @entity6 and i was thinking of buying a @entity117 dhow , ' he recounted			2
' then this hotel owner said : ' why do n't you buy the @entity2 ? she 's from @entity26 ! ' a week later @entity8 had gone to @entity120 and tracked down @entity121 , a septuagenarian who explained how he had found the hull of the boat abandoned in northern @entity26 's @entity125 national park 20 years earlier and had done it up			1
when he left @entity26 for @entity109 he brought the boat with him			2
authentic : @entity8 learned of the existence of the @entity2 when on holiday on @entity109 's island of @entity110 another five years went by between the boat 's return to the banks of the @entity6 and the start of services on the river			1
one of the challenges was to rebuild the steam engine , which was more than 100 years old			0
in the movie , directed by @entity139 and released in 1951 , the boat was powered by a diesel engine that was made to look like a steam engine			0
but when @entity121 restored it he decided to fit a real steam engine and had one airfreighted from @entity146			0
' when we got this boat , the boiler had been sitting around for a very long time , ' explained @entity89 , the @entity2 's captain and mechanic , adding that he had to strip down the engine and re-machine it			2
adventure : @entity8 ( right ) , owner of the @entity2 , stands on his boat with his colleagues on the shores of the @entity6 in @entity59 , @entity26 @entity8 explains that he has tried to recreate an atmosphere of times gone by on board his african queen , the time when huge tracts of @entity47 were - for @entity163 adventurers at least - still virgin territory waiting to be explored			1
' @entity89 wears the same kind of clothes as @entity3			0
we have adopted the fez for the waiters , which is associated with the @entity170 , where the @entity6 makes most of his journey ' , @entity8 said			1
' and we are serving gin and tonics , like @entity3 drank in the movie			2
' keeping the engine fed with wood has virtually no environmental impact , @entity8 says , since he is using wood left over from a construction project , and he has planted trees to ensure supply when that stock runs out			0
' it 's probably more environmental friendly then a modern boat , ' he says			0
