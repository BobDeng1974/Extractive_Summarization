@entity2 police today tear - gassed schoolchildren protesting against a politician 's alleged move to seize their playground and turn it into a car park			1

activists , joined by pupils , brought down the perimeter walls claiming that the playground belongs to the school smash it down : the impassioned young pupils beat the metal fence blocking access to their playground with rocks dislikes authority : the pupils and activists pulled down a wall thrown up around their playground by the private developer fight the power : the view from above shows how riot police fortified the gates to the playground with heavy blocks another brick in the wall : students and activists push down the wall that was put up around the playground over the @entity61 holidays under attack : a tear gas canister spews noxious , burning fumes in the midst of the children as police move in save the children : a man picks up a tear gas canister in an effort to move it away from the crowd of schoolchildren it was lobbed at bullyboy tactics : the children flee alongside activists and journalists after police lobbed tear gas at them to clear the area in such an incident tear gas should not have been used because the protests were not violent , acting police chief @entity85 said			1
he said five people have been arrested ; three for vandalism and two for incitement			0

once inside they pushed down at least one other wall put up to cordon off the site			2
about 40 police officers in riot gear then faced off with the children before hurling tear gas canisters into their midst			1
works democratically with peers : delighted schoolchildren run into the playground after breaking the wall illegally erected around it works well with friends : the youngsters , who were aged from six to 13 years old , had stormed their former playground holding placards aloft after smashing down walls and forcing open a tall metal gate with the help of adult activists displays good citizenship : the children had a range of placards decrying the corruption of senior politicians in @entity2 's ruling coalition expresses ideas clearly : boys and girls shout and wave placards after helping to smash the wall put up around their playground can sometimes be cheeky : youngsters rally around a placard calling for their parents ' generation to be more politically active does n't listen to instructions : children stand on the half - demolished wall with their placards as a riot policeman stands before them uses vivid language when writing : schoolboys face off against a dog handler after riot police moved in to clear them away children screamed as police officers in riot gear and waving truncheons pushed them back , some panicking as they sought water to wash their burning eyes			1

' it is difficult to believe that police can actually deploy against primary school children and lob tear gas at them to defend a land grabber , ' mr @entity251 said			1
' this image of a nation determined to steal forcefully from its own children can not be what we aspire to			0
it can not be the legacy we want to bequeath the children			0
' confident when faced with challenges : schoolchildren face off against a riot police officer carrying a long stick but accepts help graciously : activist @entity96 joins the schoolchildren and the policeman is forced to retreat and stay away ! the children wave sticks at the policeman in military fatigues , as mr @entity96 continues pointing him away from the site hmm , surely not called for ? a police officer fires tear gas towards the crowd of children inside the playground during the protest fightback : protesters take on the riot police surrounding the school as children attempt to occupy the playground fury : the scuffle can be seen here from another angle as adults angry at the police targeting children take on the riot officers comeuppance : what looks like the same police officer is seen with blood streaming down his face after he is hit with a rock and for the cows , life goes on as normal : cattle walk amidst teargas fired by riot police during the protest the demonstration came as reports emerged in local media that @entity9 senator @entity319 had filed a court action to try to reclaim the playground			1
