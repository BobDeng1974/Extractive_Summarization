by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 07:21 est , 5 march 2014 damning : @entity2 , pictured with his wife @entity3 , says young footballers want to be rich before they 've kicked a ball in the @entity6 modern footballers demand riches before they ' play one single match ' and ' queue in front of the mirror ' because they are more interested in their image than becoming greats , @entity2 has said			1
the outspoken @entity16 manager says society has changed and produced a younger generation more interested in money , fame and celebrity than ' winning titles '			1
the 51 - year - old paid tribute to @entity24 and @entity25 , saying they understood to be ' fanatical about victories ' meant they would be ' rich before the end of their careers '			2
but he added that footballers are overpaid because ' others do more to benefit humanity ' and finding young people who put winning over wealth is difficult			1
' you have to find the right boy : the boy who wants to succeed , has pride and passion for the game , ' he told @entity43			1
' his dream is not one more million or one less million , his dream is to play at the highest level , to win titles , because if you do these things you ’ll be rich the same at the end of your career			1
' what i feel is that before , players were trying to make money during their career , be rich at the end of their career			2
but in this moment , the people who surround them try to make them rich before they start their career			2
' they try to make them rich when they sign their first contract , when they did n't play one single match in the @entity6 , when they do n't know what it is to play in the @entity64			1
this puts the clubs in difficult conditions sometimes			1
' so we are working hard to give the best orientation to young players , to follow examples of guys from the past — the @entity74 , the @entity75 — who were always fanatical for victories			2
@entity2 is one of the world 's most successful managers , having played football himself at a low level in his native @entity82 before he made his big break after he became an interpreter for sir @entity85 when he was manager of @entity86			1
he then forged his own managerial career later winning the @entity88 twice , with @entity89 and @entity90			2
he is in his second spell at @entity16 , having managed @entity92 for three years before returning to @entity93			1
the special one said it was while in the @entity96 capital he saw vanity from his squad , which included @entity99			2
' lots of times at @entity92 , the players would be queuing in front of the mirror before the game while the referee waited for them in the tunnel , ' he said			1
critical : the special one says while at @entity92 , where @entity99 is a star , players ' would be queuing in front of the mirror before the game ' outspoken : @entity16 manager @entity2 told @entity43 he is desperate to find teenagers with ' pride and passion for the game ' above a dreams of being wealthy ' but that ’s how society is now			1
young people care a lot about this : they are twenty something and i am 51 and if i want to work with kids i have to understand their world			0
how can i stop my players on the bus doing , er , what do you call ? … twitters and these things ? how can i stop them if my daughter and my son do the same ? so , i have to adapt to the moment			0
' @entity2 told @entity43 footballers do ' earn too much money ' and despite the pressures of the @entity6 and working for @entity141 , ' nothing ' stops him sleeping			0
' i sleep seven , eight hours every night			0
i can not compare my job with the doctor who is doing heart surgery			0
there is much more responsibility for him than for me			0
' that ’s why i sometimes feel that we earn too much money compared to people who do much more than us to benefit humanity			0
what is football ? football is emotion			0
' winners : @entity2 has praised the ' fanaticism for victory ' of @entity25 and @entity24 he added that his wife and daughter are not fussed about football because they are ' more intelligent '			0
' in our house , it ’s two and two			0
mum and daughter isolated of football			0
they like me to win and they care about my happiness , but they do n’t live for football			0
and obviously the boy [ @entity175 ] is a boy , and at this age — 13 , 14 , 15 — he gets involved in the game , too			1
so , it ’s two for football and two who are more intelligent than the men of the house ' .			0
