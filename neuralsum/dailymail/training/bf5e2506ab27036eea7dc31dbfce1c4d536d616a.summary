@entity0 will line up in their @entity2 title showdown with @entity3 on saturday night without two of their key players in @entity6 and @entity7			1
in a double blow for @entity9 , @entity6 has been banned for three games for his stamp on @entity12 's @entity15 in tuesday 's @entity14 semi-final , while @entity7 is struggling with the hamstring injury that forced his early withdrawal from the same match			2
their absence will undoubtedly be a major boost to @entity3 as they attempt to close the gap from five to two points - but just how important have the pair been for @entity0 this season ? @entity0 will be without star men @entity7 and @entity6 ( in grey ) for the @entity3 match @entity6 has been banned for three games for this stamp on @entity12 's @entity15 on tuesday night @entity7 left the fray early in the @entity14 semi-final win over @entity12 with a hamstring injury @entity0 currently have a five - point advantage over @entity3 ahead of saturday 's match @entity0 player involvement in goals 2014 - 2015 they have been involved in @entity0 's goals on a frequent basis - @entity6 has contributed 17 goals and two assists in the @entity2 , while @entity7 has scored twice and registered an astonishing 15 assists			1
it means the @entity46 striker has been involved in 37 per cent of @entity0 's league goals this term , while the @entity50 midfielder has played a hand in 33 per cent			1
@entity7 remains well on course to eclipse @entity54 's record of 20 assists in a @entity2 campaign , set during the 2002 - 03 season , and a good proportion of them have been to @entity6 's benefit			2
there is a noticeable slump in @entity0 's form when @entity6 is not in the side - although it is not dramatic enough to suggest they are over-reliant on him			0
he has only been absent from three of @entity0 's 22 league matches but their win percentage does dip from 73.7 per cent to 66.7 per cent in his absence and the average number of goals drops from 2.4 to 2			1
@entity6 has quickly become a smash hit with @entity0 fans since his summer move from @entity75 the @entity46 striker celebrates his goal in the 2 - 0 @entity2 win over @entity78 @entity7 slides to celebrate his goal in @entity0 's 2 - 0 win at @entity80 the @entity50 star 's passing and creativity has been excellent for much of the season sport analysts @entity87 believe that a @entity0 win is the most likely outcome against @entity3 @entity7 has missed just one league match to date , the home match with @entity91 in mid-december through an accumulation of yellow cards , and they were n't adversely affected , winning 2 - 0			1
this is , however , is the first league game in which both @entity7 and @entity6 have been absent and it 's rotten luck for @entity9 that it comes in the most important game of the season so far			0
@entity99 is expected to take @entity6 's place in attack and the @entity102 has five goals in 14 career outings against @entity3 , the @entity105 winning nine of those meetings			0
