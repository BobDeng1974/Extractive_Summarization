on a wet tuesday , i am hovering furtively in the fresh produce section of @entity2 ’s			2
but my absorption in the merits of @entity5 and @entity7 @entity6 is but a cunning charade			0
i ’m really on a mission			0
i have just received four hours of tuition in the art of flirting from relationship coach @entity12 and i ’m here to put my skills to the test			1
spotting a middle - aged victim , i sidle up and deliver the line suggested by @entity12 to provoke conversation			1
‘ have you tried that kind of apple before ? ’ the man gives no sign of noticing that i have spoken			1
i clear my throat and repeat myself			0
he looks up vaguely , and responds : ‘ mmm ? ’ i say the words for a third time			1
he stares at me , shakes his head and ambles off			0
clearly , i ’m in need of more practice			0
flirting has been @entity12 ’s specialist subject for more than a decade , after doing a masters degree in social anthropology			1
not only has she produced an entire book on the subject ( @entity39 ) , but she runs ‘ @entity41 ’ courses			1
it has to be said that they ’re not cheap			0
there ’s a two - session @entity45 for £ 299 ; a three - session promotion called @entity47 ’s ( ‘ babe ’ referring to either sex ) at £ 399 ; and a three - month @entity51 programme at £ 900			1
relationship coach @entity12 advises spending time in places where you can start up a conversation with a stranger without any expectations , such as a supermarket ( picture posed by a model ) each one promises to identify where you are going wrong and give you a game plan to find your future partner			1
as a 51 - year - old divorcee who has been largely single for a year , i give it a go			2
and i ’m not the only one — business is booming for @entity12 , whose clients ’ age range spans from the early 30s to the mid 50s			1
‘ i ’m busier all the time , not because it ’s harder to flirt these days , but because it ’s become more acceptable to ask for help , ’ she says			1
‘ people are just expected to know this stuff , and they think everyone else is born good at it			2
’ @entity12 ’s three flirting secrets : 1			1
if you see someone attractive , show signals of approachability — eye contact , open body language , smiles 2			0
ask an open - ended situational question involving a prop ( so in a supermarket : ‘ that cheesecake looks great — have you tried it ? ’ ) 3			1
do n’t worry about taking the direct approach			0
at the worst you ’ve had a short conversation with someone you ’ll never see again			0
at best — who knows ? indeed , the boom in online dating and the rise of so - called ‘ silver splitters ’ , who divorce in midlife , means more of us than ever are struggling on the dating scene : one in five women over 45 is now single			1
‘ clients appreciate a scientific approach			2
flirting is a skill — you can learn it			1
i ’m a catalyst to set people on track — it ’s up to them to act on it , ’ @entity12 says			1
my four hours with her are a condensed version of one of her courses			2
judging by her central @entity119 flat where we met for the first two hours , she is doing very nicely			0
@entity12 asks what i ’m looking for , ushering me away from ‘ objectifying laundry lists ’ such as height , weight and income			1
this is not to say she advocates hooking up with a short , fat pauper			0
but she urges me not to rule out someone just because i prefer taller men : ‘ it ’s holding you back			1
how much of your life are you standing up next to each other ? ’ then she asks what i ’m doing to improve my chances of meeting someone , and suggests a big party where everybody brings a single friend , adding : ‘ you need to spend more time in places where you can start up conversations without expectations			1
’ this , it turns out , is largely what @entity12 ’s ‘ flirtology ’ is about — not being coquettish , but simply going to places where there are other people , and talking to them			1
the idea is meeting as many potential partners as possible in the hope one will click			0
it ’s a numbers game , but one you can only embark on if you ’re confident enough — which is what @entity12 hopes to teach			1
@entity12 says that flirting is ' building rapport with strangers , with a frisson in the undertone to distinguish it from normal conversation ' ( picture posed by models ) she has also devised an unlikely acronym for six flirting signals to look for			1
‘ it ’s @entity168 — humour , open body - language , touch , attention , proximity and eye contact			1
that ’s what you look for to tell someone is flirting with you			2
also self - disclosure — they tell you something about themselves			0
’ she tells me flirting is building rapport with strangers , with a frisson in the undertone to distinguish it from normal conversation			2
‘ @entity188 people do n’t like intrusion , but they love to be talked to , ’ says @entity12			1
‘ my clients can be worried about bothering people			2
i teach you to break these unwritten rules about being polite which make it so hard to meet people			0
the real key to flirting is having the confidence to talk someone you find attractive ( picture posed by models ) ‘ would you be offended if you were at the supermarket and someone asked you : “ have you ever tried that kind of apple before ? ” ’ she seems astonished when i say i might be a tad surprised			1
‘ it ’s only by trying it in a fun way that you ’ll realise people respond really well , ’ she replies brightly			1
i fear i ’m not very good at this after being turned down in @entity2 ’s			2
@entity12 tells me i am ‘ resistant ’ to my ‘ dating journey ’ , relating an anecdote about a client who asked a guy in a supermarket what rice he would recommend			1
‘ after a ten - minute chat , he invited her to his favourite curry house , ’ she concludes triumphantly			2
i ’m awed that anyone could have a ten - minute conversation about rice			0
but she is also very good at matters relating to rejection			0
‘ what does it matter if the person you ’re talking to does n’t engage ? you ’ve had a nice chat with someone you ’ll never meet again			0
’ some clients vouch for @entity12 ’s methods			1
@entity238 , a 28 - year - old from @entity119 who works in marketing , describes @entity12 ’s seminar last september as ‘ life - changing ’			1
‘ i had a two - year relationship which ended six years ago , and had only been on a few dates since , ’ she says			1
‘ i was feeling hopeless because i find it so hard to initiate contact			2
‘ it ’s made such a difference to my confidence to be able to talk to people without worrying i would do something wrong			2
’ @entity238 loved the £ 35 @entity252 tour , a two - hour group outing starting at the @entity254 ‘ where you will learn how to approach anyone without fear ’			2
so i join one of these outings			0
seven women and one man assemble , aged from their mid 20s to mid 50s , all sociable and attractive			0
@entity265 , a 35 - year - old software developer , is the lone male			0
@entity12 tells us to make eye contact with and smile at three fellow gallery goers			2
again i do n’t have the knack , resembling a crazed escapee			0
then @entity12 dispatches us into a local @entity273 to strike up conversation about groceries , telling us one client was so successful in a chat over cheesecake that the guy asked her out and they dated for three months			2
@entity12 says her goal is not always to find someone a partner , but rather to make people realise the great things they already have in their lives ( picture posed by models ) unfortunately there are hardly any shoppers			1
i attempt a conversation about light bulbs with someone who it turns out can not speak @entity295			0
we move on to a busy market to accost strangers for restaurant recommendations , and eventually adjourn to a bar			0
everyone has enjoyed it , and @entity265 has even bagged a phone number			0
it turns out he is on @entity12 ’s £ 900 , three - month course			1
he has been single for several years , and i genuinely can not work out why			0
‘ i have loads of friends but nothing seems to spark beyond that , ’ he says			2
‘ i ’ve done online dating and met one crazy person after another			0
i must be doing something wrong			0
’ actually , it turns out @entity12 ’s goal may not coincide with @entity265 ’s			1
it ’s not completely hooked on the end result of having a partner , more about realising the great things in what you already have , ’ she says			1
and as bonkers as this course can seem , that ’s a valuable lesson			0
the real thing she teaches is not flirting , but having the confidence to flirt			0
if you see someone attractive			0
do n’t contemplate talking to them			0
do it , without worrying what they will think or whether they are single			0
‘ if he ’s not single and you ’re just having a friendly chat , is it inappropriate ? ’ says @entity12			1
when i say i am going to the theatre that night , she tells me that in the bar at the interval , i must say to the man of my choice : ‘ that looks an interesting drink			0
what is it ? ’ that night at the theatre bar i find myself next to a reasonable - looking man			2
sometimes , life just is n’t on my side .			0
