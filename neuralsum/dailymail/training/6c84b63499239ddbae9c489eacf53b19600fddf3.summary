by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:04 est , 7 february 2014 a baby operated on while inside her mother 's womb has defied the odds to survive			1
@entity7 , now ten months old , was given just a 10 per cent chance of survival after her mother ’s 20 week pregnancy scan revealed she had a rare abnormality in her chest			1
@entity7 had no diaphragm which meant her major organs were pushing up into her chest and squashing her lungs , preventing them from developing properly			1
@entity7 ( pictured with her mother , @entity18 ) was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia which meant she had no diaphragm and her organs were pushing up into her chest and squashing her lungs @entity7 's parents were told that without pioneering surgery while still in the womb she would struggle to breathe when she was born and would probably not survive			1
as a result , she had to have a risky operation before her birth			0
image shows a scan of her five weeks after the operation diagnosed with diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia , her parents , @entity18 and @entity32 , were offered a termination			2
but the couple were then told about a pioneering operation which was still in its experimental stage			2
doctors explained they could operate on the unborn baby – at this point just 10 inches long – while she was still in the womb			2
the procedure involved inserting a tiny balloon into her windpipe to stop the amniotic fluid that babies inhale and exhale from leaving her lungs			1
trapping the fluid in her lungs forced them to remain expanded allowing them to develop			2
but the operation was so delicate there was a high risk of miscarriage			0
mrs @entity7 , 26 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , said : ‘ i went for my scan thinking everything was going to be fine and then the doctors started whispering			1
@entity7 's first operation saw doctors insert a balloon into her windpipe to stimulate lung growth @entity64 ( pictured with her parents , @entity18 and @entity65 ) was only given a 10 to 20 per cent chance of surviving the operation that she had while still in the womb but her parents wanted to give her a chance ‘ they told me and @entity32 that our baby was unlikely to survive			1
we were offered a termination			0
‘ but i was determined to give the baby every chance to live and they told us about this new operation			1
‘ the decision to have the surgery was one of the most difficult decisions we have ever had to make			0
@entity85 - congenital diaphragmatic hernia - is a hole in the diaphragm that allows organs from the abdomen to move into the chest			1
in severe cases , such as @entity7 's , there is no diaphragm at all			1
this prevents the normal development of the lungs meaning the baby will struggle to breathe when it is born			1
the procedure involved inserting a tiny balloon into her windpipe to stop the amniotic fluid that babies inhale and exhale from leaving her lungs			1
trapping the fluid in her lungs forced them to remain expanded allowing them to develop			2
first , doctors place a needle through the mother 's stomach and into a baby to inject a sedative			0
this is to ensure the baby does n't move			0
then a small incision is made and a camera is guided down through the baby 's mouth and throat and into the chest			2
a tiny balloon about the size of a penny is then inserted and filled with saline			0
the whole operation takes around 30 minutes			0
‘ our baby was given a 10 to 20 per cent chance of survival but what choice did we have ? ‘ if we did n't have the operation our baby would probably die anyway			1
‘ i had to give our baby the chance of life however small that was			2
’ the surgery was carried out at @entity137 in @entity138 when mrs @entity7 was 26 weeks pregnant			1
she was wide awake as surgeon professor @entity139 operated - in fact she and mr @entity65 watched the whole procedure on a tv monitor			2
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ it was fascinating and terrifying at the same time			2
knowing your baby is so tiny and fragile and is in a life and death situation was very scary			0
‘ i knew that it meant i could go into premature labour and i could lose my baby that way			2
but it was a risk i had to take			0
‘ the doctors placed a needle through my stomach and into the baby then injected a sedative to send her to sleep so she would n't move			0
‘ a small incision was made and a camera was guided through her mouth and down into her throat and into her chest			0
‘ a tiny balloon about the size of a penny was inserted and filled with saline			0
the whole operation took around 30 minutes			0
’ mrs @entity7 was told the balloon would have to be removed before her baby was born but she went into labour at 35 weeks , catching everyone by surprise			1
the baby was born last march weighing 5lb 15oz and the couple named her @entity64 because they never gave up hope that she would survive			2
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ she had to be paralysed with an injection when she was born so she did n't breathe on her own at first			0
the operation @entity7 had in the womb allowed her lungs to develop because it enabled them to expand			1
when she was born , she had to have another operation , this time to move her organs back to her abdomen and to insert an artificial diaphragm when @entity7 was diagnosed her parents were offered a termination as her prognosis was so poor @entity64 ( pictured with her father in hospital ) was given her name because her parents never gave up hope she would survive ‘ then she was taken into intensive care and underwent a three - hour operation to move her organs around			1
‘ doctors then used a synthetic patch inserted into her chest as she did not have a diaphragm muscle			0
’ this patch fills the role of a diaphragm and allows her lungs to expand without being hindered by her other organs			1
full - time mother @entity202 and support worker mr @entity65 are now looking forward to @entity7 's first birthday just a month from now - and she is a normal healthy baby about to take her first steps			1
@entity7 ( pictured in hospital after her second operation ) is now learning to walk and will soon be celebrating her first birthday mr and mrs @entity7 ( pictured on @entity7 's first day at home ) say they will forever be grateful to all of the doctors and nurses who saved their daughter mrs @entity7 said : ‘ she is an absolute joy and has made us so happy			0
when we see her smile it 's hard to take in the journey she has been through before she got here			0
‘ she is a miracle in every sense of the word when i think she was only given a 10 per cent chance of survival			0
’ @entity7 will need another operation when she is older but for now her parents are just enjoying their precious new addition			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ we are so proud of her - she is a very precious little girl			1
‘ it 's amazing to think a tiny balloon saved her life while she was still in my womb			0
we will be forever grateful to the doctors			0
‘ we are very lucky to have our gorgeous daughter - we savour every moment			0

a 20 - week scan showed that @entity7 had no diaphragm
this meant her organs were pushing into her chest and squashing her lungs
her parents were told she would probably not survive without surgery
she had a pioneering procedure to insert a balloon into her chest allowing her lungs to expand - she was given a 10 **%** to 20 **%** chance of surviving
immediately after her birth she had to have surgery to fit an artificial diaphragm but she is now a normal , healthy 10 - month - old baby
