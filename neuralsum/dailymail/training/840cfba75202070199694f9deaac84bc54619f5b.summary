selfie sticks have been banned at the upcoming legs of the @entity11 festival the festival 's promoter took to @entity14 last week to express his hatred for the contraptions he has now warned fans they will have selfie sticks and tablets confiscated at the gates and put in a cloak room if they try to bring them in after support from fans and festival goers calling for him to ban them , the promoter told his followers to ' consider it done '			1
@entity9 also warned patrons if they tried to bring tablets into the upcoming legs of @entity11 - which hits most @entity53 capital cities - they would be confiscated			1

after many fans took his side on @entity14 about barring the devices he made it official he said no one would be allowed to bring a tablet into a @entity74 ' ever again ' @entity9 has pointed out the danger but also inconvenience they are to other festival goers the promoter said the final straw came when he saw someone taking a photo of themselves with a selfie stick instead of the band on stage ' most of them are pointed at the stage with kids taking photos			1
but i think the one that kind of put it in perspective for me was there was a band set going and a young girl pointed it at herself , ' @entity9 added			0
he said that was the final straw for him and said if she had n't been a paying attendee he would have grabbed the stick off her and kicked her out			0
@entity9 said there was no way he would allow selfie sticks or tablets into the @entity109 leg of @entity11 this weekend , and would instead confiscate them and put them in a cloak room until after the festival			1
@entity9 made sure to make his point clear on social media this week some other uses also pointed out the dangers of the selfie sticks being used as weapons the promoter helped the ban would help fans simply go and have a good time watching the performances the promoter said not only was he concerned about fans illegally recording bands ' sets , they posed a danger and also an inconvenience for those there to see the performances			1
