@entity0 has laughed off suggestions he is already fighting to save his job as @entity4 manager			1
the former @entity8 boss , in his first international appointment following a well - travelled club career , has had a rocky start			1
the 62 - year - old replaced @entity10 following this summer 's @entity11 with high hopes of topping a @entity14 qualifying group conspicuously lacking in star power			2
@entity0 has denied reports that he is facing the sack as @entity4 manager but it has not been an easy ride so far , with a 1 - 0 home defeat behind closed doors against @entity21 and a 1 - 1 draw in @entity23 on saturday			1
@entity24 is brewing beneath the surface and defeat at the hands of @entity29 leaders @entity30 on tuesday could incite the notoriously fickle @entity32 fans			1
but @entity0 was in relaxed mood at his pre-match press conference and had a colourful response for the @entity37 journalist who suggested he may face the same fate as @entity39 , the @entity40 boss who was sacked after @entity30 's victory in @entity42			1

' it is very important to beat @entity30			1
' if we do not reach @entity57 it is a disaster me , for everybody , and i would be the chief executive of the disaster			0
' a spokesman for the @entity65 also stepped in to remove any doubt about @entity0 's future , stating : ' there is no fear			1
the @entity65 is willing to travel not just to the @entity70 but to the next @entity11 with mr @entity0			1
we support him with all of our efforts			0
' @entity4 ( right ) have started their @entity14 qualification poorly so far under the 62 - year - old @entity0 is taking the threat of @entity30 seriously , though @entity4 remain strongly fancied on their home turf			1
having seen a number of surprising results over the past week , he is wary of any side carrying the underdog tag			2
' it is not important who is favourite , we know very well @entity30 play good football , ' he said			2
' i am not surprised they are top because i know football very well and football is changing			0
look at @entity92 , they lost ( to @entity93 ) , look at @entity94 , they lost ( to @entity95 ) , look at @entity96 , a draw ( with @entity98 )			2
