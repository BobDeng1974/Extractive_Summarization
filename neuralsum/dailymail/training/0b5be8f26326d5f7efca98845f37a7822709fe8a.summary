read @entity1 's match report from the @entity2 here @entity3 threw in the towel on the title race on sunday evening after watching @entity6 blow another winning position at @entity8			1
the @entity9 surrendered a lead at the @entity2 , with @entity12 's side scoring twice in three minutes through @entity13 and @entity14 to turn the game on its head			1
@entity17 had put the visitors in front , but they were n't able to hold on for the second time in a week			0
‘ if you look at the number of points they have , if they keep that up nobody will catch them			2
‘ there does n’t look to be anybody capable of challenging them at the moment			0
’ @entity3 was far less impressed with his own side , who led through @entity17 before a wonderful @entity13 free - kick and @entity14 ’s header left the @entity9 12 points off the pace			1
the turnaround followed their stunning @entity54 capitulation from 3 - 0 up against @entity55 in midweek , in which they stuttered to a 3 - 3 draw			1
@entity3 said : ‘ @entity31 are on an average of 100 points this season			1
if you look at the number of points they have , if they keep that up nobody will catch them , that ’s for sure			2
‘ there does n’t look to be anybody capable of challenging them at the moment			0
’ he added : ‘ we had a very disappointing week , considering the performances we produced and the end results we got are very disappointing			0
‘ we were 3 - 0 up against @entity55 and 1 - 0 up here and in the end we lose two points against @entity55 and three points against @entity8			1
i think it ’s very , very disappointing because you have to be capable , once you are 1 - 0 up and a big team , to win the game			1
’ @entity3 was at a loss to explain the latest collapse , in which @entity85 looked furious after being substituted for @entity86 in the second half and then stormed down the tunnel at full time			1
@entity13 's stunning free kick flies past @entity90 to level the game for @entity8 @entity3 can only watch on as his team again lost a game he believes they should have won @entity3 admitted @entity85 ’s behaviour ‘ is not my biggest worry at the moment ’ as he rued a missed chance to climb back into the top four			1
‘ i do n’t know how damaging it is ( to morale ) , but in the table certainly it ’s very disappointing , ’ he said			0
‘ we had an opportunity to come back into the top four in a bit more of a comfortable way			0
that we did n’t take it is disappointing			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s unfortunate to lose a game like that			2
we produced quite a decent performance for 75 minutes but you have to last 90 minutes			2
did tuesday night play a part in our mind ? i do n’t think so			0
‘ you have to give @entity8 credit - they did n’t give up , they fought until the end , they scored a good free - kick and in the end we lost the three points			2
’ @entity12 , who has guided @entity8 to fifth in his first campaign as permanent manager , said : ‘ we saw what happened in midweek ( to @entity6 ) but we prepared for the @entity6 we all know			2
i know they suffered in midweek but they are dangerous			0
we managed them very well			0
‘ we are very happy going into the international break with the points that we have			0
’ @entity17 had put the @entity9 into the lead in the second half after a clinical counter-attack @entity17 celebrates his goal , but @entity3 was left frustrated by his team 's inability to see out the win @entity8 players celebrate @entity13 's equaliser at the @entity2 , before grabbing the winner @entity6 players ca n't hide their dismay after @entity8 's second goal and it meant @entity6 lost another lead @entity144 ( left ) struggled to cope with @entity146 's pace ahead of @entity8 's winner video we did n't perform until the final whistle - @entity3			1

@entity6 lose 2 - 1 at @entity2 after leading 1 - 0 with *15* minutes to go
@entity13 scores stunning goal before @entity14 wins it
@entity3 says ' it is *difficult* to explain ' *defeat* in ' very *tactical* game '
the result leaves @entity3 's side 12 points off leaders @entity31
