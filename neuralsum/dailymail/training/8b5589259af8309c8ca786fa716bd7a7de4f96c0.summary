@entity1 head coach @entity0 has told @entity2 to maintain his red hot form - even if it means sparking unwanted interest			1
the 21 - year - old is the top @entity7 scorer in the @entity8 with four goals this season ahead of the @entity1 ' trip to @entity11 on saturday			1
he was tipped for a call - up to the @entity14 ' senior side but has been included in @entity16 's under 21 squad for their @entity18 2015 play - off games with @entity19 instead			1
@entity2 has enjoyed a flying start to the season with @entity1 @entity0 wants @entity2 to continue his early season scoring streak and is not worried about interest from elsewhere			1
' i certainly would n't want @entity2 not to play well because i did n't want him going anywhere else , ' he said			2
' it 's in everyone 's best interests that he continues to play as well as he 's been playing - and continues to develop			0
' and if in the end he goes somewhere else - and it 's a move that is seen as taking his career to the next level , then that would be fantastic and he 'd go with our blessing			0
@entity2 was unfortunate to miss out on a place in @entity39 's senior @entity14 squad ' so the message is to carry on playing well and scoring loads of goals - if he does that we 'll all be happy			1
' @entity2 's brace helped the @entity1 beat @entity45 4 - 0 last week and they go to @entity46 on the back of three straight wins			1
and if he keeps scoring then @entity0 insisted he would not be under any pressure to sell the @entity51 international			0
' if @entity2 gets to the stage where there 's a while load of big clubs chasing after him - then he 'll have done a brilliant job for us in the meantime , ' he said			2
@entity0 insists the @entity1 are under no pressure to sell their star man ' then it becomes a matter of whether the club want to do business with anyone or not			2
there 's no set rule as far as that 's concerned			0
' the club will make the decision on any player who 's attracting attention from other clubs			0
' as we 've shown already this summer , we 've kept hold of some players who other clubs were chasing - but we let others go			0
' it would depend on the nature of anything that happened down the line			0
