by @entity0 published : 15:43 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 18:22 est , 6 march 2014 publication has been canceled for a planned book based on a popular and anonymous @entity5 feed about @entity6 and the financial industry			1
@entity8 , an imprint of @entity10 , announced thursday it would not release @entity11 's @entity12 : @entity13 in the @entity14 , which had been scheduled to come out in october			1
' in light of information that has recently come to our attention since acquiring @entity11 's @entity12 , @entity8 has decided to cancel its publication of this work			2
' revealed : this is @entity11 - who is living in @entity22 at the moment and who has never worked for @entity6			0
he has been exposed as the fake employee behind the @ @entity5 account which lampoons @entity28 bankers @entity8 spokesman @entity29 said the publisher would have no further comment			1
the @entity5 feed , @ @entity5 , had hundreds of thousands of followers and purported to offer an inside and irreverent take on the financial giant			1
but just weeks after @entity8 announced in january that it had reached a deal with the feed 's purported author , the @entity36 revealed his identity as @entity11 , a former bond executive who was based in @entity22 and had never worked for @entity6 , despite earlier public comments that he did			0
@entity8 initially defended @entity11 , saying that he had not misled them and that publication would continue as planned			0
but earlier this week , @entity11 posted an open letter on businessinsider.com saying the @entity5 account was ' not a person at all			0
it 's the embodiment or aggregation of " every banker , " a concentrated reflection of a @entity28 culture and mentality			0
' the @entity5 account was so popular that @entity6 launched an internal inquiry to discover the identity of the indiscreet tweeter ' the issue of my anonymity was simply a device , and one that has suited the construct of the @entity5 feed , ' he wrote			1
' for the avoidance of any doubt , any person who actually thought my @entity5 feed was literally about verbatim conversations overheard in the elevators of @entity6 is an idiot			2
an agent for @entity73 did not immediately respond to a message left thursday for comment			0
stark realities : the account purely played up to a sense of humor that those involved in huge international finance would share cutting : the humor and parody at the center of the @entity5 feed caused a panic at @entity6 when it was launched in 2011			2

publisher @entity8 will not publish @entity12 : @entity13 in the @entity14
