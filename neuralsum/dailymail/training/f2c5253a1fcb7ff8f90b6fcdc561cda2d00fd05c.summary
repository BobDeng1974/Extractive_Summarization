@entity9 , 39 , died of a cardiac arrest while being detained at @entity12 police station in the @entity13 on august 4 2010 , an inquest decided yesterday			1
the @entity15 footage shows the officers responsible for him gathered around a computer while they were supposed to be keeping a constant watch on him			0
it also said custody sergeant @entity34 faked records to make it appear officers were checking on mr @entity9 more often than they did			1
the review was published after an inquest saw footage showing officers laughing , joking and swearing			2
the jury was also told that pc @entity43 made personal phonecalls , and officers surfed inappropriate websites , including one where ' women were offering sex '			1
father - of - two @entity9 , 39 , from @entity51 , died after having a heart attack in his cell in august 2010 @entity27 associate commissioner @entity54 , who published the report , said : ' the indifferent treatment of mr @entity9 by officers and staff of @entity59 showed a disregard for both the stated procedures of detention and also for human decency			1
' the care given to mr @entity9 fell well short of what was expected from when he was arrested to the moment he sadly died			1
' instead of taking mr @entity9 to hospital officers kept him in a police cell and instead of helping him , @entity68 and @entity69 mocked him			1
' in addition to the failure to care properly for mr @entity9 , this was a worrying case highlighted by the findings from our investigation that @entity78 deliberately recorded incorrect information in the custody record and failed to adequately monitor mr @entity9 , @entity68 preferring instead to surf the internet and make personal calls			2
' such actions are not what i would expect to see from the police officers and staff			0
' mr @entity9 collapsed at the police station after being arrested for appearing to be drunk and incapable			1
delivering the verdict that mr @entity9 's cardiac arrest had been caused by underlying alcohol problems the jury said the risk assessment was inadequate			2
they also said 15 - minute visits were not carried out on time and a nurse was late to attend to him			0
the chairman said : ' on his arrival at custody , mr @entity9 was n't capable and , according to policies in place he should not have been detained in custody , he should have been taken to hospital			2
' it is the findings of the jury that , had mr @entity9 been on a monitor in @entity110 at the time of his heart attack , the probability is that he more likely would have survived			1
' @entity68 , who arrested mr @entity9 and was later tasked with monitoring him , was found guilty of misconduct and had to undergo further training and development			1
@entity116 was found guilty of gross misconduct and handed a final written warning			0
police check on @entity9 , 39 , was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and incapable on august 4 , 2010 mr @entity9 collapsed at the police station after being arrested for appearing to be drunk and incapable @entity9 's devastated mother , @entity121 , said her son would still be alive if @entity59 officers had ' done their job '			1
speaking outside the court , she added : ' i hate to think another family has to suffer the way we did and still are - it affects you for the rest of your life			0
' i was satisfied with the inquest process because it brought out the truth - the truth about @entity59 and the officers who dealt with my son			2
@entity138 @entity43 ( pictured outside @entity139 ) made personal telephone calls on the station 's landline and his mobile phone , it was claimed ' their behaviour was an absolute disgrace			0
they failed @entity9 miserably in their duty of care to him and i feel they assisted in his death			2
' it 's very clear from the evidence we 've seen over the last ten days that officers were not carrying out procedures			0
' if they had , my son would still be alive today			0
' @entity51 coroner @entity159 said a ' change of culture ' was needed in the force as she prepared to submit her report to prevent future deaths			0
she added : ' i remain concerned essentially about the conduct in custody suites			0
' i appreciate a custody suite is a very difficult environment to work in but you have very vulnerable people coming in			0
' more cctv played at the inquest showed officers dragging mr @entity9 out of a police van by his legs , staggering around his cell and hitting his head against the wall			1
responding to the inquest verdict and the @entity27 report , assistant chief constable @entity178 said : ' the jury at @entity182 has found officers failed to carry out an adequate risk assessment when arresting mr @entity9 , placing him in custody instead of taking him to hospital			1
' they also found that , once in custody , proper checks were not adequately carried out and visits were not maintained on schedule			0
' we do not underestimate the impact the death of @entity9 has had on his family and friends and the force extends its sincere condolences			0
' on behalf of the force , i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to @entity9 's family			0
