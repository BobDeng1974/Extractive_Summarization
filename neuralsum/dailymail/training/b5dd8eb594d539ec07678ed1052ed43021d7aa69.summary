if your @entity1 has become bent out of shape , @entity0 may offer you a replacement			1
a support employee told @entity6 during a web chat that the decision would be ' 100 % up to the store ' in which the device was returned to - and that it would be on a case - by - case basis			1
but , the employee added that if , following an inspection , the damage met certain guidelines then a free replacement would be covered by the phone 's warranty			1
an @entity0 support employee has since revealed the firm may replace bent devices - but only on a case - by - case basis @entity0 has not released an official line about the replacements , and is not commenting on reports that the larger handset is vulnerable to being bent			1
the problem , dubbed ' bend gate ' by some on social media sites , is due to the phone 's thinner aluminium exterior - but can be solved by ensuring the middle of the phone is not subjected to a large force			1
it is believed that the thinner model , in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design , causes the frame to deform			1
a video , uploaded to @entity55 by user @entity56 , shows the @entity1 bending using just his fingers			2
it has already been viewed more than 18.5 million times			0
macrumors detailed on tuesday that ' a small but growing number of @entity1 owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch '			1
during the web chat , @entity6 journalist asked if a ' bent enclosure occurring during normal use ' would be covered by a warranty			0
the support employee , replied : ' that is 100 per cent up to the genius you speak with at the store			1
' a genius is an @entity0 employee ( stock image ) who works in stores the reason for the bend is due to the @entity1 being made out of aluminium			1
aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so , if enough pressure is applied , it will bend and move			2
according to @entity89 , no part of either of the new @entity88 has more than a quarter of an inch ( 0.64cm ) of aluminium in any spot			0
this means that , in areas of the phones that are weakest , it ’s possible it could be susceptible to bending			0
this is noticeable in images , with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the sim card slot			0
these areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and sim card , so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend			1
to stop the phone bending , users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone			0
for example , do not have it sideways in a pocket , as your pocket will push it against your leg , possibly causing bending			0
putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect , so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option			1
another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied			2
during the web chat , @entity6 journalist @entity136 asked if a ' bent enclosure occurring during normal use ' would be covered by a warranty			0
the support employee , who has not been named , replied : ' that is 100 per cent up to the genius you speak with at the store			1
' a genius is an @entity0 support employee who works in stores around the world			1
the online employee continued that the genius would carry out a test known as a @entity153 , and if the damage was within the guidelines , @entity0 would be able to cover it			1
it has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5 - inch phone and the use of aluminum on the frame will cause the new @entity1 ( pictured ) to bend if pressure is applied the bendy feature of the new @entity1 ( pictured ) has been met with wide criticism on social media the bendy feature of the new @entity1 was met with wide criticism on social media and some hashtagged ' bendgate ' as they poked fun at the defect			1
one user wrote : ' @ tim_cook hi @entity172 , i absolutely love my new @entity1 ! ! my favorite feature is the flexible display			2
' however this is n't the first time @entity1 frames have warped while the issue is n't unique to @entity0 , @entity176 reports			1
it was further mentioned the thinner design and the use of aluminum on the frame causes the phone to misshape if pressure is applied			1
however , other @entity187 users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure			2
app developer ‏ @ drbarnard said : ' it ’s actually impressive that the 6 @entity195 does n’t break			0
seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage			0
' while @entity200 co-editor @ panzer added : ' just an anecdote : i carried around the @entity1 for 5 days in a pocket at @entity205 on rides & coasters and did not bend it			1
' reports in 2012 claimed that the @entity1 had similar frame weaknesses			2
the @entity211 release last year was met with similar complaints			0
@entity0 's chief executive @entity213 ( pictured ) announced on monday the firm sold over 10 million of its ' bigger than bigger ' models , setting a new three - day sales record			1
it beat the @entity211 and @entity218 's record of 9 million the @entity1 has a 4.7 - inch screen , while the @entity1 has a 5.5 - inch display			2
both models also include the @entity0 - designed @entity223 chip with second generation 64 - bit desktop - class architecture , said to boost performance and power efficiency			1
they also have advanced @entity229 and @entity230 hd cameras , and users in the @entity232 will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using @entity235			0
besides larger screens , the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments			0
in the @entity232 , the @entity1 6 starts at $ 199 for @entity242 on a two - year contact , $ 299 for @entity244 and $ 399 for @entity245			1
a sim - only handset starts at £ 539 in the @entity248			0
the @entity1 costs $ 299 on a two - year contract for @entity250 , $ 399 for @entity244 , $ 499 for @entity245			2
unlocked , the handset starts at £ 619 in the @entity248			0
@entity253 devices are also vulnerable , and the @entity254 in particular was found to bend under pressure , as did @entity257 's @entity256			2
other devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to have a curved frame , including the @entity261 and the @entity262			0
both devices were said to be more comfortable to hold , and easier to place in a back pocket			1
@entity0 announced on monday it sold over 10 million of its ' bigger than bigger ' model , setting a new record since it launched three days after the launch on friday			1
this beat the previous record of 9 million for last year 's @entity211 and @entity218			0
however @entity0 has not yet responded to @entity271 's request for comment regarding the issues with the latest model			0
this is n't the first time @entity1 frames have bent or warped ( pictured ) , and the issue is n't unique to @entity0			1
reports in 2012 claimed that the @entity1 had similar frame weaknesses			2
the @entity211 release was met with similar complaints			0

both devices were said to be more comfortable to hold , and easier to place in a back pocket			1
and as @entity0 's bad week continues , the firm was forced to remove its latest software update following reports it broke certain features on the new handset			1
users began reporting overnight that the upgrade to @entity298 robbed them of signal , data service and the @entity302 capability			0
as its the second major issue to arise with @entity0 's newest iphone since it was launched on friday , many are claiming the @entity305 and @entity1 are the most troubled new products since the @entity308 and ' antennagate			1
' shortly after the @entity308 launched in 2012 , customers struggled to get signal when the phone was held on the lower left edge of the frame			0
@entity0 issued a statement advising customers should ' avoid gripping [ the phone ] in the lower left corner ' when making or receiving a call , which was met with even more complaints			2
however , the company acted quickly to pull @entity298 from the @entity321 when users began reporting the problems within minutes of its release			0
the glitch appears to affect only the newest iphones - not @entity218 or @entity211 , or older models			0
@entity0 users on networks across the @entity232 , @entity248 and @entity330 were reporting problems via @entity187 and official support forums after updating their operating systems			2
@entity0 announced it was investigating the glitch , but in the meantime recommended that owners of affected @entity88 restore their devices by connecting to @entity338			2
in an official statement , the tech giant said : ' we apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users , and are working around the clock to prepare @entity345 with a fix for the issue			0
' other devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to have a curved frame , including the @entity261 ( pictured )			0
the phone is said to be more comfortable to hold , and easier to place in a back pocket the @entity353 ( pictured ) , revealed last year , is another phone designed to have an intentional curved display			1
it has a 5.7 - inch concave screen attached to a curved casing , which @entity253 says can boost the viewing angle for videos			0

reports claim ' a small but growing number ' of @entity1 6 plus handsets bend when placed in a back pocket
the *unintended* extra feature has been dubbed ' bend gate '
thinner design and aluminium casing of the larger phone causes the issue
an @entity0 support employee has said the firm may replace bent devices
but added it would be up to *individual* stores , on a case - by - case basis
the next - generation @entity0 *smartphones* launched on friday
@entity0 has not yet commented on the reports
