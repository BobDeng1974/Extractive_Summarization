by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 31 may 2014 updated : 16:01 est , 31 may 2014 when @entity2 and @entity3 bought their idyllic @entity6 home @entity4 in 1992 , it was a ramshackle shell needing complete renovation			1
more than 20 years later , it has been transformed into a perfect family home and has all the luxury trappings you would expect in the light of @entity2 's successful business career founding the @entity14 snaps photographic chain			1
the couple estimate they have spent more than £ 500,000 renovating the property near @entity19 , now on the market for £ 2.95 million			1
back in 1992 this idyllic @entity6 home , @entity4 , needed complete renovation they moved here from their two - bedroom flat above the @entity14 snaps store in @entity26 , @entity27			1
@entity2 , 58 , set up the company in 1982 with schoolfriend @entity29			2
the pair were working for the @entity32 franchise print company @entity31 and spotted a gap in the market for quick photographic printing			2
' we learnt a lot about franchising from @entity39 and were looking for a business we could franchise ourselves , ' explains @entity41 on a trip to @entity43 , @entity29 spotted a one - hour photo - processing machine gathering crowds in a mall			0
it sparked an idea and the pair invested £ 70,000 in a similar machine sourced from @entity51 and opened their first store , named @entity54 at @entity2 's suggestion , in @entity56 , @entity27			1
more stores nearby quickly followed , in @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
after testing out the concept for two years and realising there was a demand for fast printing , the pair decided to franchise the business			1
by the 1990s they had 155 franchise stores - three of which have been run by @entity2 's wife @entity3 over the years			1
' that was our peak - just before the great switchover from analogue to digital , ' says @entity2 , who explains that they made sure the business survived the shift by diversifying into canvases , posters and printable gifts such as mugs and mouse mats			0
@entity2 and @entity3 at their home which is transformed and has all the luxury trappings last year he and @entity29 sold the business to the @entity88 shoe repair chain for a reported figure of between £ 2 million and £ 3 million , although the terms of the sale mean @entity2 is unable to confirm or deny this figure			1
' we had no great plan at the beginning - we had no idea what we were doing at the time , ' says @entity2 modestly , although the schoolboy friends had shown entrepreneurial flair from the time they first met aged 13			0
' i always had a paper round and i worked at a paying - out booth at @entity106 dog track when i was in my teens , ' says @entity2 , a trained chartered accountant			0
the pair also set up a t - shirt printing business while at school , selling customised shirts to their fellow sixth - formers			0
they converted the loft to create two extra en suite bedrooms and built a swimming pool and tennis courts @entity4 , which is set in eight acres , was built in 1926 by the @entity120 family from the @entity122 estate			0
it was for one of their sons , who had suffered shell shock after the @entity127			0
when the @entity129 bought it , for £ 500,000 , it had been empty for years following the deaths of its previous owners			1
the couple spotted it in an advert in @entity137 and fell in love straight away			0
' it was the first house we looked at outside @entity27 and i do n't remember viewing any others , ' says @entity41 ' it was amazing , like a time warp , with crazy 1950s wallpaper and a higgledy - piggledy maze of rooms on the ground floor , ' adds @entity3 , 53			1
as well as rewiring , they knocked through the tiny kitchen , and servants ' rooms and larders , to create a large , open - plan kitchen / diner with an adjoining conservatory and a study			0
the @entity160 kitchen set them back £ 80,000			1
they converted the loft to create two extra en suite bedrooms and built a swimming pool and tennis courts and landscaped the garden			0
now that the couple 's children - @entity171 , 24 , @entity172 , 23 , and @entity173 , 21 - have all flown the nest , the couple have decided to downsize			2
they will divide their time between a smaller house in the same area and their home in @entity180 in north - west @entity181 , where @entity3 grew up			1
they knocked through the kitchen , servants ' rooms and larders , to create a large , open - plan kitchen / diner @entity2 says : ' it 's sad but we 're being realistic			2
we do n't want a big house falling apart around us when we 're older			0
at the moment it 's in a great state of repair so it seemed a good time to sell , ' explains @entity41 the recent announcement that @entity198 will be extended from @entity199 to the local station @entity19 ( a brisk five - minute walk from the property ) is likely to boost interest , according to agent @entity204 of @entity205 and @entity206			1
she adds : ' it can be a sticky market for properties over £ 2 million because of the seven per cent stamp duty threshold			2
' we 're finding strong demand for properties in the £ 1.5 million to £ 2 million bracket because of this			2
but the fact that @entity4 is so close to the station and commuters can be on a train into @entity220 ten minutes after leaving their house on foot will make all the difference			0
