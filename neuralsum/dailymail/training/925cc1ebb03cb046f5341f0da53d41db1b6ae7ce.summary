it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			2
there 's a @entity6 manager manager who is impressing in @entity7 and a @entity9 boss who brought some style to @entity11 , plus a broadcaster put before the @entity14 jury for his lack of film knowledge			2
what 's hot @entity18 the @entity20 coach took touchline chic to new levels when he appeared at @entity23 looking set for a night out in the nearby @entity24			2
memo to @entity26 : do n’t try and copy this look			2
@entity20 manager @entity18 looked ready for a night out while standing on the touchline at the @entity29 @entity30 where are all the bright , young @entity33 managers ? in the championship , it seems			1
the latest is 33 and manager of @entity37			1
he has won seven out of nine since taking over and previously managed at @entity40			0
no , i ’ve absolutely no idea how they found him either			0
@entity30 has made a good start to life as @entity37 manager @entity48 still in the championship , @entity50 ’s team caught the eye with a remarkable 42 shots in their win at @entity55			1
given that only four of them went in , what on earth happened to the other 38 ? @entity48 's @entity61 celebrates scoring a hat trick goal in @entity48 's 4 - 0 win over @entity55 @entity64 a coup for @entity66 to coax @entity67 on to the ‘ @entity70 ’ programme and a blessing to see him looking so well			1
those who dismiss him as a dim - witted boozer should read his book			0
it ’s only because of his remarkable spirit that a true genius is still with us at all			0
@entity64 appeared on the @entity81 on @entity82 alongside @entity83 and @entity84 @entity67 looked well despite his recent troubles as he recounted stories from his career what 's not @entity89 @entity91 commentator @entity90 is the latest analyst to be hauled before the social media jury after mistaking one black actor , @entity90 , for another , @entity90 , in the crowd at @entity96			1
confusing two black men does not make you a racist			0
it just means you should watch more films			0
@entity91 presenter @entity90 mistook @entity90 for @entity90 at @entity96 @entity102 @entity103 have more wide men than an episode of @entity106 and this one has complained that @entity108 has not been in touch during his spell at @entity111			1
he also mentions , in the same interview , that he has changed his phone number			0
@entity102 says he has not spoken to @entity103 manager @entity108 during his time at @entity111 the capital one cup final we love the @entity117 and sunday ’s final should provide a decent showpiece			1
what a shame , then , that it may be overshadowed by the two @entity121 matches taking place on the same day			1
why is this allowed to happen ? @entity123 rivals @entity124 and @entity125 will do battle at @entity127 on sunday for the first piece of silverware @entity130 owner @entity131 maintains a strong interest in the affairs of @entity134 , the man sacked when the club was 17th in the @entity121 last season			1
two managers later , @entity130 are closer to the foot of the @entity139 than the top			0
it looks a long way back			0
@entity130 owner @entity131 ( right ) still maintains an interest in the affairs of ex-manager @entity134 ( left )			0

@entity30 is the latest young manager to impress in the championship
@entity48 scored four goals from 42 shots against @entity55
@entity64 looked well as he appeared on @entity82
@entity102 says @entity108 has not been in touch with him
@entity117 final could be overshadowed by @entity121 games
