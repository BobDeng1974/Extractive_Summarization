by @entity1 reporter published : 19:29 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 20:17 est , 27 may 2013 of the 85 kids who have won the @entity4 , only one became an instant movie star			1
for the millions who watched back in 1999 , @entity7 's face is frozen in time , because the year she won the bee , movie makers were shooting ' @entity11 , ' the @entity13 - winning documentary about the competition released in 2002			1
as this year 's spelling bee drew closer @entity7 reflected on her life since winning the bee 14 years ago and the legacy she left behind for young competitors			1
@entity7 won the @entity4 at age 14 in 1999			1
she became famous after she was featured in the 2002 @entity13 - winning documentary on the bee ' spellbound ' for those who saw the film @entity7 will always be the 14 - year - old girl from @entity26 , @entity27 , with the glasses and dark shoulder - length hair , her arms raised while leaping for joy			1
she became a role model for those who realized it 's ok to be nerdy			0
since the film was made the bee 's popularity has skyrocketed , in part because of @entity7 and the other spellers featured in ' @entity11 , ' a film that made smart people cool long before @entity41 's ' @entity40			1
' @entity7 also became a trend - setter , starting a run in which 10 of 14 national bee winners have been @entity46 - @entity45 , including the last five			1
today , she 's 28 and finishing up a master 's degree in cancer biology with plans to enroll in the @entity52 in @entity53 , having changed course from a career plan that had her researching memory and the brain for three years at @entity58			2
she now aspires to be a physician scientist			0
@entity7 , now 28 , writes out her winning @entity4 word ' logorrhea ' on a board at the @entity63 where she earned her undergrad degree ' my intellectual inspirations are so meandering			1
i blame that on the @entity4 sometimes , ' @entity7 said with a laugh			1
' there are so many interesting things in the dictionary to study			0
' @entity7 will be watching this week when the 86th @entity4 takes place near the nation 's capital			1
her friends tease that her life ' shuts down ' during the bee , but she 'll see a spectacle that 's changed much since she graced the stage			2
the finals are now broadcast in prime time			0
a vocabulary test is being added this year for the first time			1
' i 'm amazed at the sea change , ' @entity7 said			2
' because when i was a speller , that was one thing you totally hid			0
i remember like not even wanting to tell people what i was doing over the weekend when i was competing in the regional spelling bee			0
it was that big of a liability			0
and now i see that , yeah , people want to be nerds			0
i think that 's great			0
' @entity7 jumps for joy after winning the @entity4 in 1999			1
since her win 10 of the 14 national bee winners have also been @entity46 - @entity45 @entity7 is the first to say that winning the national bee has been an overwhelming positive in her life , even if does get tiresome to have people repeatedly asking her to spell her winning word ' logorrhea , ' or to realize that her reputation can unfairly put her on a pedestal in an academic setting			1
' i 've had people say ' i expect more of you because i 've seen what you are capable of , '' @entity7 said			2
' and that 's a huge honor and also very daunting			0
' then there 's another set of emotions she feels every year when her name is mentioned by the @entity46 - @entity45 youngsters who now dominate the national bee			1
all of the recent winners , to some degree , have cited @entity7 as an inspiration			2
' it 's absolutely overwhelming , ' she said			0
' and i think especially as i 've grown older and seeing how much i 've wanted to emulate people in my life			0
yeah , it 's very humbling every time i hear that			0
it feels like a lot of responsibility , to be perfectly honest			0
you become very conscious of that			0
' @entity7 was the winner of @entity4 the year it was filmed for an @entity13 - winning documentary ' @entity11			1
' after the movie 's release @entity7 was rocketed to fame there have also been a disproportionate number of recent winners interested in the brain and medicine , including several who said they wanted to grow up to be neurosurgeons			2
@entity7 pursued an undergraduate degree in brain , behavior and cognitive sciences at the @entity63 , in part because of her experiences from the bee			2
' why do i remember certain words and not others ? why is n't my memory so good for everything else ? ' she said			0
' that question sort of drew me into research			0
' at least much of the terminology was familiar			0
after studying all those big words for the bee , a standard vocabulary test is a breeze			1
i remember taking the @entity165 years ago , ' she said , ' and how i had such an edge over other competitors because i basically studied the vocabulary component for the @entity4			1
' @entity4 champions are a small and tight - knit group			2
@entity7 keeps tabs with many of her fellow winners , and she marvels that she had the nerve to pull off her win all those years ago			1
two years ago a 26 - year old @entity7 spoke to a local @entity26 , @entity27 television station about her life since winning the @entity4 in 1999			1
she is currently studying cancer biology at @entity58 she turned down a chance to be featured on an @entity181 reality show that wanted to follow her through college ; she was n't comfortable with the idea and did n't feel she was crazy enough to be interesting			0
besides , there is life beyond the bee and that 's where @entity7 prefers to keep her focus , at least during the 51 weeks a year when she 's not glued to the television to see another successor crowned			1
like @entity7 , this week 's champion will have a winning moment etched in @entity45 's collective conscious and immortalized on the @entity196 , lasting long after he or she has grown up to pursue an impressive degree or career			2
' it 's something that you fight quite a bit , ' @entity7 said			2
' especially now that i feel like i 'm on a career path , it 's becoming a little bit easier ' ' people always thought of me as this nerdy , excitable , just an awkward kid			0
now they can see me as somebody beyond that , i hope			0

@entity7 became won the @entity4 in 1999 and was the subject of the 2002 @entity13 - winning documentary ' spellbound '
since her famous win 14 years ago , @entity7 is overwhelmed and honored to be a *source* of inspiration for young spellers
this year 's bee on may 28 is changing the rules and will feature a vocabulary test for the first time
