no shame : child rapist @entity1 grinning after his arrest in 2013 - he was free for several years after the attack because of a bungled police investigation and was jailed for five years on friday a grinning child rapist able to live streets away from his victim for years afterwards because of a bungled police investigation has finally been jailed for five years			1
@entity1 , 23 , dragged the teenager into his house and abused her in october 2009 as she walked to a youth club in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the girl , now 18 , eventually went to police in february 2010 and was interviewed by officers who then mysteriously dropped the case			1
three years later police visited her about a different matter and she asked why her rape case was shelved , and detectives then arrested and charged @entity1 with rape			1
today @entity23 admitted ' unacceptable delays and failures ' allowed the rapist to live as a free man just streets away from the girl he attacked			0
she has made a formal complaint about the conduct of the officers involved , and the @entity33 is aware of the case , which will be investigated internally			0
superintendent @entity35 , from @entity23 's @entity36 , said : ' there were unacceptable delays in bringing the case to court after the initial complaint was made			0
' the victim received a service that i believe fell below the level which we strive to offer to victims of rape and other sexual abuse			2
' an investigation is underway to establish the reasons and circumstances around our initial response and apparent lack of action in progressing this case			0
' in october 2009 , the victim was walking along @entity59 , @entity12 with her friends and all were making their way to a nearby youth club			1
@entity1 called the girl over his house on false pretences , separating her from her friends			1
crime scene : the victim was walking to her local youth club when @entity1 dragged her into his house in @entity59 , @entity12 , pictured , and raped her once her friends had walked out of view he dragged her into the house and raped her			1
last year it emerged that @entity23 faced ten investigations into alleged mishandling of sexual assault and rape cases			0
one included a claim that a vulnerable child was able to enter the home of a suspected paedophile , who was already under surveillance			0
in 2013 , the same year @entity1 was finally arrested , @entity23 chief constable sir @entity84 admitted that six out of every ten crimes were not properly investigated			1
@entity13 's officers only ' actively pursue ' criminals in 40 per cent of cases reported to them , he said , with detectives effectively shelving or ' screening out ' the rest because there are no witnesses or clues			0
it meant that more than 106,000 crimes in @entity13 were all but given up by the force as lost causes			0
today the force said that it takes sexual abuse seriously			0
probe : @entity23 is investigating why the case was initially shelved after a complaint from the victim detective inspector @entity104 , from @entity23 's @entity105 , said : ' @entity23 's @entity105 was first made aware of @entity1 's appalling crimes in 2013			1
' as a result , a full and thorough investigation was completed that resulted in this matter being brought to court and which aided in bringing @entity1 to justice			2
' while the @entity114 absolutely accepts the failures in this case , we should also stress that the work of @entity105 and the @entity119 partnership over the last few years that has made huge strides towards protecting vulnerable people who are at risk of child sexual exploitation ( @entity124 )			2
' working with our partner agencies , we can make use of legislation at our disposal to disrupt premises where we suspect @entity124 may be taking place , shut those premises down and also arrest and investigate suspects so we can put them before the courts , as we have done with @entity1			2
' with the launch of the ' it 's not okay ' campaign we are increasing public awareness of how to protect children at risk by increasing people 's understanding of child sexual exploitation and how to spot the warning signs of @entity124			0
' together , we will continue to tackle @entity124 and continue to pursue people like @entity1 and expose them for the criminals they really are ' .			2
