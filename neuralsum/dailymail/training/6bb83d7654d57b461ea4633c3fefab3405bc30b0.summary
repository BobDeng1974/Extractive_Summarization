by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 22 april 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 23 april 2012 with roads and tube lines set to be more congested than ever this summer a few people may be tempted to use it an excuse for a day off			0
but for employees at data services provider @entity6 a chaotic commute during the @entity8 will hold no weight			1
that 's because , in a bid to keep things ticking over this summer , bosses at the @entity15 company are asking staff to sleep at work - in space pods			1
sleeping on the job : staff at @entity15 based @entity6 will be given the choice to sleep at work during the @entity8 , in a bid to avoid busy commutes far from sleeping on the job engineers at the @entity28 based firm in east @entity15 will be asked to stay behind and sleep in the claustrophobic capsules to avoid the rush hour			1
and while other companies are set to offer staff the luxury of working from home during the @entity36 the firm behind the capsules hope to get more workplaces on board			2
@entity41 , the firm behind the unusual cabins , are billing them as the perfect solution to the @entity8 ' congested commute			0
on their official website they state ' @entity15 businesses will be severely affected by the transport problems caused by the @entity8			1

' coming in a range of colours , the capsules made of polycarbonate , sell at anything from Â£ 1,375			0
the stock models are fitted with either foam mattresses or a standard single mattress as well as a storage shelf , mirror and power points			0
tight squeeze : there is limited space in the pods as shown here basic : some of the pods are fitted with just a foam or single mattress these types of capsules have been around for years , in hotels , but @entity6 is thought to be among the first to have them stalled at the workplace			1
an independent report carried out by @entity91 last year estimated that around 450,000 visitors will stay in the capital while 5.5 million people will visit for at least a day during the @entity36			0
