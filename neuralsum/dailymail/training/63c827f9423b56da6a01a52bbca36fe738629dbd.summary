@entity0 is paying a record $ 22.5million fine to settle allegations that it broke a privacy promise by secretly tracking millions of web surfers who use @entity6 's safari browser			2
the penalty announced thursday by the @entity8 is the largest fine imposed against a company for violating a previous agreement with the agency			1
in spite of their hefty payout , @entity0 is n't admitting any wrongdoing in the latest settlement			0
shady dealings : the fine comes as the @entity8 argues @entity0 used it 's cookie software to track user 's information without their knowledge they claim that the fine does not directly pertain to @entity0 's data collection , but for misrepresenting what was happening			1
last october , @entity0 had signed a 20 - year agreement that , among other things , included a company pledge not to mislead consumers about its privacy practices			0
the @entity8 opened its investigation into the @entity35 activities six months ago after a researcher at @entity37 revealed that @entity0 had overridden @entity35 safeguards that are supposed to prevent outside parties from monitoring web surfing activity without a user 's permission			1
the tracking occurs through snippets of computer coding , known as cookies , that help internet services and advertisers target marketing pitches based on an analysis of the interests implied by a person 's web surfing activity			0
paying up : @entity0 ceo @entity54 and his fellow officials deny any wrongdoing in the case but are paying the fine because they misrepresented previous findings @entity0 immediately withdrew its intrusive technology from @entity35 after the manipulation was reported			0
but the circumvention of @entity6 's built - in settings appeared to contradict a statement in @entity0 's online help center assuring @entity35 users that they did n't need to do anything more to ensure their online activities would n't be logged by @entity0			0
the apparent contradiction between @entity0 's words and actions became the focal point of the @entity8 investigation			2
@entity0 's fine surpasses a nearly $ 19million penalty that the @entity8 slapped on a telemarketer accused of duping people into believing they were donating to charities			1
@entity0 's stock price increased 60 cents to $ 642.83 in midday trading thursday , after the @entity8 announcement .			2

fine is the largest in the *history* of the @entity8
