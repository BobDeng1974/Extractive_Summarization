by @entity0 world record : @entity2 produced more than 2,600 watts of power to hit his 100m time of 9.58 seconds olympic champion @entity2 produced 50 times more energy than that of a speeding bullet during one of his record - breaking 100metre runs , scientists have revealed			1
physicists studying the secrets of @entity2 's success announced the findings after a detailed study of the @entity19 sprinter 's 100m performance during the @entity20 in @entity21			2
they discovered that he produced a remarkable @entity23 of energy - compared to just @entity25 of energy a bullet produces when it leaves the barrel of a 0.44 calibre @entity30 handgun			1
they also calculated that he reached a top speed of 27mph during the race			0
but unlike a bullet - which can reach 1,000mph - @entity2 's huge 6ft 5ins frame meant more than 92 per cent of his energy was absorbed in battling air resistance			1
the researchers found he had to produce an ' extraordinary ' amount of power to reach his 100m world record time - and because he 's so tall he is less aerodynamic than the average human			1
they made the discovery after taking into account the altitude of the @entity21 track , the temperature at the time of the race and the cross-section of @entity2 himself			1
@entity2 reached a maximum power of 2,619.5watts - a horsepower of 3.5 - within 0.89 seconds when he was only at half his maximum speed , which shows the effect the drag had on his acceleration			2
@entity61 , co-author of the study which was published in the @entity63 , said : ' our calculated drag coefficient highlights the outstanding ability of @entity2			0
' he has been able to break several records despite not being as aerodynamic as a human can be			2
the enormous amount of work that @entity2 developed in 2009 , and the amount that was absorbed by drag , is truly extraordinary			1
' it is so hard to break records nowadays , even by hundredths of a second , as the runners must act very powerfully against a tremendous force which increases massively with each bit of additional speed they are able to develop			0
fastest : @entity2 , pictured at @entity82 , had to exert an ' extraordinary ' amount of power to make the time because his large frame makes his less aerodynamic ' this is all because of the ' physical barrier ' imposed by the conditions on @entity90			0
of course , if @entity2 were to run on a planet with a much less dense atmosphere , he could achieve records of fantastic proportions			0
' the researchers , from the @entity96 , claim their equations can be used to calculate the effect of a tailwind , which can vary between races and significantly reduce running times			0
they compared @entity2 's time in @entity21 with his previous world record time of 9.69 seconds , set during the @entity104 a year earlier			2
in @entity105 @entity2 was running with no tailwind , but in @entity21 there was a tailwind of 0.9 metres per second			0
according to the researchers ' new equations , @entity2 would have clocked a slower time in @entity21 if there was no tailwind , but would still have beaten his world record from @entity105 - they predict that he would have run a time of 9.68 seconds			1
resistance : @entity2 developed more than @entity117 of energy but more than 92 per cent of it was absorbed by the drag the calculations in the study were tested for accuracy by fitting real - life experimental data into the equations			1
the figures were from the @entity129 's ( @entity128 ) laser velocity guard device , which recorded @entity2 's position and speed every one - tenth of a second during the 2009 race in @entity21			1
dr @entity61 added : ' the accurate recording of @entity2 's position and speed during the race provided a splendid opportunity for us to study the effects of drag on a sprinter			0
' if more data become available in the future , it would be interesting to see what distinguishes one athlete from another			0
' @entity2 is in @entity147 at the @entity148 today to take part in a anniversary games to mark a year since @entity82 .			0

researchers analysed physics of his record - breaking 2009 race in @entity21
he produced more than @entity117 of energy but 92 per cent absorbed by drag
a speeding bullet has around @entity25 of energy when it leaves the barrel
his huge 6 ' 5 " frame means he is less aerodynamic than average human
