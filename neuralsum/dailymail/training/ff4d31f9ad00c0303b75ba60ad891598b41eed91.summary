by @entity0 if you value comfort and space , these are probably not the homes for you			2
a team of students from the @entity8 and @entity9 have designed tiny houses for ‘ affordable ’ living			1
the 3d printed homes are intended to provide an alternative for young adults struggling to get on the property ladder			1
young adults may soon be living in shell - like @entity16 printed homes if a project to build mini houses is realised			1
these 3d printed abodes would be intended to provide an alternative for the many young adults struggling to get their foot on the property ladder the students from @entity27 future lab , led by @entity28 and architect @entity29 , studied at the @entity30 and the @entity31			1
university students in @entity33 announced the other day they have designed mini-houses for urban living			1
' @entity36 ' are 8 feet wide , 16 feet long and can fit in @entity8 parking spaces			1
each $ 40,000 abode can be individually tailored and decorated			0
the team says half of @entity8 's 105 million parking spaces are empty			1
and the ' housing crisis ' could be solved by filling them with these homes			2
their mini-homes are about 50 square foot ( 4.6 square metres ) and were designed as a part of a project on ‘ @entity50			1
’ the houses are entirely 3d - printed , providing a cheaper living solution than modern homes			2
the houses are dome or mussel shaped and could be placed in various locations around the world			1
their portability and small size means that , in theory , they could be taken to places where regular houses could not be placed			0
when closed , the top level of the home serves as a bed with the ‘ spring mattress ’ , which is also 3d printed			2
the closed structure is entered and exited via a small door located on the wall			0
a projector is also included inside , allowing multimedia such as movies to be viewed inside the mini-home			0
at the top a small eye - like window provides light inside the claustrophobic environment			0
on the ‘ ground floor ’ is a movable kitchen countertop			2
this also has a sink that covers a ‘ bathtub ’ of sorts			0
a small kitchen can be extended that , apparently , is comfortable enough for two people			2
there ’s even a fridge for you to store food and drink			0
and @entity29 tells @entity94 that the illustrations you can see here are accurate representations of how much space would be inside each of the prototype houses			0
he stresses , however , that he will not be bringing the products to market - they are merely intended as an example to show what is possible			0
all the parts for the homes are @entity16 printed and then put together , including the bed and the sewage system here the ' bedroom ' area is shown with a ' spring mattress ' to sleep on			2
the team of students , headed by @entity28 and architect @entity29 , developed the 3d printed houses to offer comfortable accommodation on a smaller but much more affordable scale last year , the graduate students of @entity118 teamed up with other students from @entity120 and @entity121 to explore the topic of @entity50			1
the students from @entity27 future @entity124 studied at the @entity30 and @entity31 a projector inside the home allows you to watch tv shows and movies while you are ' relaxing ' the ‘ bathroom , ’ also found on the ground floor , has a folding toilet that is hidden in the wall when not in use			1
the house even has a shower as well			0
the entire home is designed to be @entity16 printed , including the electricity , heating , water , sewage systems and thermal insulation			0
‘ returning to the @entity148 topic , it is necessary to underline that the apartment was printed on a highly detailed level , ’ the company said in a release			0
on top of the world : the designers suggest their 3d printed homes could be placed in less accessible locations around the world such as , supposedly , on top of mountains and hills the industrial 3d printing process is shown here through which the homes are created ‘ so for example you can see the mattress springs , heating , water , electricity sewage systems and thermal insulation			1
' however , according to the company , heater and water treatment devices are not able to be printed yet so non- 3d printed replacements are used for now			0
the hope is that the finished fully - @entity16 printed homes could provide a solution for housing young adults around the world			1
it is rumoured that a @entity182 company is interested in manufacturing the product on a large scale to the order of hundreds			0
@entity29 says he is not involved in talks with them at the moment , but he would be involved ' for sure ' if they got in touch			0
coming to a city near you ? the unique shell - homes are shown here on display in a city street , where they could provide cheaper and more accessible living for young adults all of the components of the houses are @entity16 printed save for the heating and water treatment devices is this the future of living ? five of the @entity16 apartment designs are shown at a dockland here			1

a team of students from the @entity8 and @entity9 have developed tiny homes
shaped like a mussel , they are designed for young adults and students
the homes measure just 50 sq ft but include household items
this includes a bed , bathroom , kitchen and even a folding toilet
the portable homes could be placed in various locations around the world
