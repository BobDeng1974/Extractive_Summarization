a summer she will never forget for all sorts of reasons could take another remarkable turn for @entity4 with a serious run at the @entity7 title			1
just as her high profile split from the @entity10 has ignited his golf the same could be said – albeit on a slightly lower plane – for her tennis , and last night she scored one of the best wins of her career			1
in steaming humidity on the @entity19 she overcame fifth seed @entity21 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 2 to score a hugely popular victory that puts her through to the last eight			1
@entity4 is training to run the @entity46 in november , and her increased levels of stamina helped in the hostile conditions as she warded off one of @entity21 ’s trademark fightbacks with some scintillating tennis			1
energy : @entity4 munches on a banana between games false dawn : @entity21 celebrates winning a point but @entity4 had the last laugh going through : @entity4 clenches her fists after winning the decisive point she also had to contend with the @entity61 ’s usual stalling tactics and early in the third set implored umpire @entity63 to try and speed up the pace of play from the other end			1
@entity21 had already been given a code violation for taking too long in the permitted ten - minute break after two sets which the women are allowed in searing heat			1
@entity4 , a former world number one , went into a slump during her relationship with @entity74 as trying to keep it going across the world took its toll on the pair of them , and this is her first @entity81 quarter final since january 2012 in @entity82			1
after he dumped her by phone in may when the wedding invitations had gone out she regrouped and has played steadily better since , actually winning an event in @entity87 the day he claimed the @entity89			1
winner : @entity74 's career has gone from strength to strength after he ended his relationship with @entity4 @entity4 afterwards brushed off questions about whether the split from @entity74 had re-energised her saying : ' i do n’t think that ’s really relevant here			1
' she was more open about her marathon training , explaining that she was told this highly unusual form of preparation for a tennis player should not be over-damaging on her joints : ' to be honest , tennis is tough on your body			1
' i think all of us wake up every morning and something is hurting			1
you know , we play on hard courts so much and it takes a beating			1
but at the same time , i have done a lot of running			2
i do a lot of running in my training anyway			2
' so i think my team looked and said , look , she 's so excited about this			2
she 's doing it for charity			2
she 's so pumped about it			2
so they just said , go for it			2
you know , tick off as many things on your bucket list as possible			2
they 're happy for me			0
' she denied questioning her ability to return to the top of the game after a prolonged dip , adding : ' i never doubt myself			0
i work hard every day			0
i know i have the levels to compete against anybody , and i can beat anyone on a good day			0
but as i said , the women 's game is really evolving and it gets tougher and tougher			0
' the season for me has been a little bit up and down , and it 's so nice to kind of start feeling like i 'm playing the way i want to			0
you know , this hard court season has been amazing for me			0
' i actually started already feeling really good on court since @entity150			0
i have just been building on my game since then			0
' today i just kept thinking to myself , just stay in there			0
try and take the initiative			0
' the wind was blowing a lot from one side of the court			0
so you kind of had to adapt a lot			0
