it was a surreal start to the day for a bleary - eyed night shift worker , after he got a lot more than he bargained from his morning cereal			1
@entity5 , 22 , woke up at about 3pm last tuesday and headed into the kitchen at his home in @entity8 in @entity10 's northern beaches			1
he took some food out of the fridge and walked over to the kitchen counter when he saw something strange and scaly sticking out of a @entity16 box			2
' i thought mum had bought some strange door stopper at first but then i saw the tail end of what looked like a snake and thought " no way its a snake " , ' he told @entity31			0
' then i peeked in the top of the cereal box and its head popped out , ' he said			1
' i dropped my food and ran out of the kitchen and screamed out to my dad downstairs " dad , there 's a snake in the kitchen ! "			0
' his father also took a while to comprehend the situation thinking his son meant there was a snake on tv			0
' when dad walked in it maneuvered even further into the box that 's when i took the video			0
' @entity5 then called the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) and explained to the lady on the other end of the phone where the slithery reptile was hiding			1
' she burst out laughing and said " are you serious ? " , he said			0
the diamond python retreated into the box when @entity5 's dad came to see the unexpected surprise the snake handler turned up minutes later and was surprised to see the size of the python , which he estimated at about one and a half metres long			1
' he asked if we minded if put the snake back in our garden which we did n't , ' @entity5 said			2
' the snake would n't fall out of the box so he had to rip it and the whole snake dropped out			0
' ' he was more surprised when he saw it properly because he said it actually looked about two metres long			0
' diamond pythons are known for being quite timid and the snake handler told @entity5 that the species is harmless and only attacked when aggravated			2
although @entity5 has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he was impressed with how attractive the reptile was			1
' he 's a good looking snake so if he comes back it 's fine - i just did n't expect to find it in my cereal			0
' the snake handler had to rip open the cereal box to release the snake which was two metres long although @entity5 has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he described the diamond python as ' good looking '			1

@entity5 , 22 had started to *prepare* his *breakfast* when he noticed something unusual about his @entity16 cereal box
after a few seconds of *disbelief* , the night shift worker realised that there was a snake in the box
he called @entity54 for *advice* on how to *remove* the slithery reptile
says the good looking reptile is welcome to return to his house
