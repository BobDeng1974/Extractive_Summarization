@entity0 has released a professionally produced propaganda video blaming @entity3 president @entity2 for the recent deaths of an @entity3 and @entity6 hostage in @entity7			1
the video clip features @entity9 , a top commander for @entity0 in the @entity10 , accusing @entity2 of recklessness and warning the @entity3 against attempting to carry out rescue raids on hostages in future			1
@entity16 's comments mark the first time @entity0 has made a public statement since @entity19 - born @entity3 national @entity20 and @entity6 @entity21 were killed when @entity3 special forces attacked an @entity0 safe house in a failed attempt to rescue the two men last week			1
the six - minute video - released by the terror group 's in - house @entity28 media centre - appears to have been shot using an expensive hd camera in the style of the professionally produced and edited films put out by @entity0 's @entity35 enemies in @entity36 and @entity37			1
shared on the terror group 's social media websites , the slick effort marks a significant step up in professionalism from the grainy films previously released by @entity0 and its affiliates			1
the terror commander accused @entity2 of recklessness , and said the raid ' caused things to go in a completely different way than we wanted			1
' @entity2 previously said he ordered the raid because @entity20 , a 33 - year - old journalist , was believed to be in ' imminent danger			1
' the president condemned @entity20 ' killing as a ' barbaric murder			2
' @entity3 officials said that about 40 @entity3 special forces were involved in the rescue attempt , which followed @entity3 drone strikes in the area			2
the rescuers , backed by @entity7 ground forces , advanced within 100 meters of the compound in @entity77 province when they were spotted by the militants			0
a firefight ensued , and the raid was over in about 30 minutes , they said			0
hard decision : @entity2 previously said he ordered the raid because @entity20 , a 33 - year - old journalist ( pictured in a recent @entity0 propaganda video ) , was believed to be in ' imminent danger ' @entity16 described the rescue operation as an ' execution order ' and that poorly equipped militants fended off heavily armed @entity3 forces for nearly three hours			1
initial @entity0 demands were never clear , but @entity9 said the terror group wanted to negotiate the release of detainees held at @entity94			2
he also mentioned @entity95 , known as the ' @entity95 ' , who is serving a life sentence in the @entity3 on a terrorism conviction			2
' they could have at least negotiated with us about some clauses or show sincerity , ' he added			0
@entity102 laid plans : @entity104 made it to within 100 yards of mr @entity20 and fellow captive @entity21 but they were executed by their captors before the team could reach them @entity16 also warned that @entity0 would continue to ' put the lives of all @entity3 in danger inside and outside of @entity3 ... in the air , on the ground and in the sea			1
' @entity115 considers @entity116 to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror group founded by @entity119			0
the group has been linked to several sophisticated plots to attack the @entity3 homeland that were either botched or foiled			0
with the permission of @entity7 's government , the @entity3 has for years launched drone strikes against militant targets in the country and provided @entity7 with hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance			2
civilian casualties from the drone strikes have stoked anger			0
hours before the release of the video , the group said that it shelled a @entity7 air base used by @entity3 forces			0
it was not immediately clear if there were casualties			0
@entity0 has issued a veiled warning to @entity141 propaganda chiefs by attacking sickening beheading videos as damaging to the international image of @entity145 terrorism			0
in a 43 - minute long filmed statement released earlier this week , senior @entity0 commander @entity146 said the terror group would no longer be beheading captives - adding that in future hostage executions would be carried out ' with a bullet '			1
although he did not name @entity141 , @entity9 's message - which he said made on behalf of @entity0 as a global organisation , not just his @entity10 branch - was clearly aimed at the terror group led by self - appointed caliph , @entity157			2
' no doubt , some of our brothers were affected by seeing scenes of beheadings that were spread recently			0
we do not accept and we strongly reject them , ' he said in a clear reference to @entity141 ' brutal filmed murders of @entity3 @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 , @entity19 @entity169 and @entity170 , and 22 @entity36 soldiers by the group 's executioner in chief , @entity172			1
' recording such acts , and spreading them among the people in the name of religion and jihad , we see as a big mistake			0
it is not acceptable , no matter the justification , ' @entity9 added .			0

@entity0 commander says @entity2 's ' recklessness ' was to blame for deaths of @entity3 national @entity20 and @entity6 @entity21
@entity146 said @entity3 refused to negotiate before rescue mission
claimed @entity0 had attempted to strike a prisoner *exchange* deal
terrorist chief warned @entity3 against future hostage rescue attempts
