as many of you are no doubt aware , transfer deadline day actually started about two weeks ago over at @entity2			1
the studio has been given a makeover for the new season			1
much like the new doctor ’s @entity6			2
and also like that rather unique @entity9 , there is an irascible @entity10 at the the helm			1
but @entity14 ’ very own timelord @entity12 ( ‘ the clock is ticking ! ’ ) ca n’t be at the controls all the time			1
no worries , though , because his team of assistants have been fanning the flame for this particular monday since the season began			2
indeed , so much was the chain cranked over the approaching days , even come monday morning , with over 11 hours to go , the studio felt like it was already at @entity24 1			1
one presenter even riffed on @entity12 ’s repertoire and told us the ‘ clock was ticking @entity29 ’			1
although on further inspection , it was actually ticking at the normal rate			2
phew ! no teething problems for the new studio there , then			1
it showed us a multi-split screen of their reporters on the ground			2
which actually looked like an episode of @entity57 in anoraks			2
also out the traps early was deadline - day favourite @entity60			2
his enthusiasm , first - hand knowledge and ready wit is custom built for this date in the calendar			2
and he put all of that to good use in a story about an agent who could n’t work a fax machine and how all the girls in the office ‘ used to wear flats ’ so they could scamper about more easily			2
‘ i bet the girls here wished they could do that ’ , was the awkward , muttered reply			2
but this was all just breakfast fayre			2
the main feast would be served from tea time when @entity83 , sorry @entity84 , and his beautiful assistants @entity42 and @entity38 made their entrance			1
and i do n’t mean to be frivolous or condescending about their @entity88 here			0
because there is no doubt that @entity2 happen - chanced across a piece of pure light entertainment with the transfer deadline			0
and when they saw it was becoming something of a spectacle , quite rightly , they went for it ! tricks of the trade : @entity104 attempted to restore order by using the vanishing spray at @entity107 crowd control : @entity104 was copying @entity35 referees with his spray not working : one fan managed to get in front of the camera and was pushed away by @entity104 keeping them entertained : a @entity116 fan agreed to do the @entity117 on @entity14 out of hand : supporters made a mockery of @entity14 ' roving reporters at the grounds extreme viewing : a sex toy was shoved in presenter @entity126 's ear as he spoke outside @entity127 trying : @entity128 offered @entity104 safety indoors the problem with that is , it ’s a bit of a one - trick pony			1
quite frankly , only the names of the players really change			0
the rest is the same old story			0
and as a result , as the windows roll by , their front of house faces have to try to continually up the anti			0
so what are the options ? well , use the set ! they gave @entity12 a dentist ’s reception couch on which to occasionally ruminate on matters			1
while he and @entity42 also got to stand at the big video wall so he could show us his trousers were too long			1
there were even the occasional forays into their ‘ nerve centre ’ , to show us the cutting edge sight of people staring at computer screens			1
but the problem is , that ’s not what brings home the bacon			0
that is the job of their men in the field			0
them , but mainly , whichever member of the public decides this is their @entity173 ’s @entity172 audition			0
@entity2 ' regional reporters may once have thought it was quite fun to have a bit of an audience when they work			0
indeed , while the sun is still shining , it is something of a cakewalk for them			0
but then , after dark , they are basically static targets for all manner of custard pie attacks			0
which in the case of this deadline , for example , manifested itself in a sex toy to the ear at @entity192 , and some choice language straight into the mic from an athletic chap outside the @entity196			1
while outside @entity107 , @entity104 ’s gag with a vanishing spray failed as both a joke and crowd control			1
calm down : fans have taken to gathering at grounds to get on @entity14 on deadline day lady in red : @entity207 took the early evening shift as the transfer activity hotted up incoming : reporters were getting the latest transfer news at it happened , right up until the 11pm deadline @entity213 : viewers saw @entity207 and @entity215 replaced by @entity12 , @entity216 and @entity217 awkward : the changeover was far from smooth as the window entered its final three hours through to the end : @entity217 and @entity12 have been the final anchors for several deadline day shows as a result of these incidents @entity42 , not the first or the last time , was forced to apologise ‘ for anything you saw or heard that was offensive ’			1
which strikes me as the most hollow of statements			0
because quite frankly , anyone watching who does n’t think they ’re going to see and hear things that are , in those terms , offensive have clearly not engaged in the abstract social intercourse of @entity2 on transfer deadline day before			0
indeed , they are more likely to be offended if they could n’t actually relive the moment time and time again on some social media outlet or other			0
quite frankly , this was n’t much of a transfer deadline window			0
which is the way it goes			0
but i ’m not sure @entity14 quite gets that now			1
because once they started making the content light entertainment , and their presenters showbiz turns , they went down a road that was difficult to come back from			1
do n’t get me wrong			0
there ’s a lot of good solid telly journalism happening on the band wagon they are rolling out			0
and there is certainly drama that goes along with that			0
however , all the banging of drums and firework displays the channel feel the need to use to maintain the hype serves not to enhance it , but obscure it in smoke and mirrors			0
it ’s been a fun ride , @entity14			1
but perhaps its time to get back to basics ?			1

@entity14 have a new studio but their show was more of the same
@entity12 resumed his role as their ' timelord '
the @entity10 was assisted by @entity42 and @entity38
but the fans were allowed to run riot outside grounds
@entity104 used the vanishing spray to keep the crowd back
fans brought a *inflatable* doll and sex toy which were shown live
