@entity2 's @entity1 debt has finally be repaid in full – more than 100 years after the outbreak of the conflict			1
the government repaid some £ 1.9billion still owed to more than 100,000 people who held ' @entity7 ' , issued in 1917 to help fund the military effort			1
@entity9 said he could pay off the debts because he can borrow the money cheaper elsewhere			2
more than 100 years after it started , the first world war debt has been paid off by the @entity14 government the government was paying 3.5 per cent in interest to the 120,000 people who bought the bonds in 1917			1
the @entity18 estimates that @entity2 has paid some £ 5.5 billion in total interest on the loans since 1917			1
current low interest rates mean the government is able to pay off the debt with new bonds which pay a much lower rate of interest			2
mr @entity9 said : ' this is a moment for @entity2 to be proud of			2
we can , at last , pay off the debts @entity2 incurred to fight the @entity1			1
' it is a sign of our fiscal credibility and it 's a good deal for this generation of taxpayers			0
it 's also another fitting way to remember that extraordinary sacrifice of the past			0

the @entity50 claim that @entity2 can borrow at such low interest rates because the government has got a grip of the public finances and international investors know they will get their money back if they lend it to the @entity2			1
they claim the @entity58 's spending plans would see billons added to the national debt			0
treasury secretary @entity61 said : ' there is a clear choice at this election : sticking with the competence and stability of @entity68 and the @entity70 ' long - term economic plan that 's securing a better future for @entity2 – the deficit has been halved , there are 1.85 million more people with the security of a regular wage and the economy is recovering from @entity58 's @entity77			1

' the warning came after @entity58 's shadow chancellor @entity93 claimed @entity9 's spending plans would mean £ 70billion of cuts – more than double the amount admitted by @entity68 and @entity9			0
he said if the @entity50 were to keep to their promises to protect spending on health , schools and overseas aid , this would mean the @entity103 and @entity104 being shut down altogether			0

he added : ' the @entity50 now have a choice			0
they can either say that these unprecedented , extreme and close - to - impossible cuts to our police , armed forces and social care are the true consequences of their spending plans , ' he said			0
' or they can confess that their plans are in fact impossible to achieve without breaking their promise to protect the @entity130			0
