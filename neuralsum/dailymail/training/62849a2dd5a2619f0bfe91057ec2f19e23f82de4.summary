in court : @entity11 , left , and @entity83 , right , appeared alongside three other men accused of paying girls for sexual services ' they were very vulnerable girls , some of whom came from unstable or difficult backgrounds			1
they were easy prey for these men , who made them feel important and safe , buying them presents to keep them on side			2
' the girls at times felt flattered by the attention and were grateful for the gifts			2
but they gradually realised that what they were involved in was wrong , they were putting themselves at risk and the men were exploiting them			2
' he added : ' we have a dedicated team of officers who work with other agencies , such as social care , to safeguard children and investigate cases of abuse and exploitation			0
' it is important that people realise that men who abuse children come from all walks of life , backgrounds and cultures			2

' the girls have had to wait for two years for this case to come to court where they then had to relive their horrific ordeal all over again			2
' giving evidence in court and being questioned in front of the perpetrators has been a harrowing experience for them			1
' they have showed amazing bravery and strength of character and without their testimonies these men would not have been convicted			2
' this case demonstrates that child sexual exploitation can come in many forms from on - street to internet grooming and that offenders can come from all walks of life			0
' we hope these verdicts show that child sexual exploitation will not be tolerated in any form			0
' the charity family lives , which provides help and support to families , said : ' the jury 's verdict in the trial of these five disturbed individuals , who preyed on " vulnerable " teenage girls for sex , sends a clear and unequivocal message that this will not be tolerated			0
' parents and guardians have a duty to educate both themselves and their children about the dangers of who their children associate with when outside the school and home environment			0
' even within the home , parents and families need to be aware of the risks of new streams of social media and pressure to participate in sexting - the sending of inappropriate images			0
' @entity275 encourages all parents and carers to have conversations with their children about the consequences of associating with adults - male or female - who offer alcohol and narcotics freely to their children			0
' no one can know where their child is 24/7 , but parents can equip themselves with support and information on how to talk to their kids about the consequences of engaging in risky behaviour			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
