@entity0 may not have worn his special - edition birthday boots against @entity2 , but the ones he did lace up in @entity4 certainly did the job			1
in the 2006 and 2010 @entity7 the left - footed magician scored just once			0
he has four in three games this time round â€“ a brilliant double against @entity2 taking him on par at the top of the goal - scoring charts with @entity17 's prodigal son , @entity16			1
in @entity21 , @entity0 was lining up against one of the few goalkeepers who has come out of a duel with the @entity38 star relatively unscathed			2
at the @entity40 the @entity2 goalkeeper made four world - class saves to keep @entity0 at bay , as @entity38 edged past their @entity44 opponents 1 - 0 courtesy of a sixth - minute goal from @entity48			1
salute : @entity0 celebrates scoring his second goal of the game against @entity2 those happy memories were consigned to the past after just three minutes of their rematch at the @entity55			2
a divine throughball from @entity57 found @entity58 on the left side of the area			0
the @entity62 midfielder flicked a shot against the post , which rebounded off @entity21 's head and back on to the post , and there was @entity0 , running at full pelt but still somehow able to guide a thumping finish into the roof of the net from 10 yards			1
within a minute @entity2 were level , @entity73 cutting in from the left and whipping a finish inside the right - hand post			2
the strike , deservedly , had both @entity2 and @entity38 fans on their feet			0
all smiles : @entity2 goalkeeper @entity21 shares a joke with @entity0 during the @entity33 clash @entity0 nearly got on the end of a flowing move in the 25th minute to restore his side 's lead			2
after instigating the move himself with a driving run from the right , di @entity58 's sweeping cross / shot just evaded @entity38 's no 10 at the back post			2
two minutes before the break @entity0 forced @entity21 into a fine diving stop with a curling free kick from 35 yards			1
with his sighters set the recently - turned 27 - year - old gave @entity21 no chance from a second set piece less than a minute later			0
@entity100 : @entity0 @entity101 hot : @entity0 curls home a free kick for his second goal against @entity2 in @entity4 @entity0 won the free kick by gliding past two challenges before being chopped to the ground by @entity2 centre - back @entity106			1
there were no questions about who would take it , as @entity0 grabbed and placed the ball down immediately			0
he then curled the dead - ball sublimely into the top - right corner , @entity21 so bewitched by the flight of the strike that he did not even dive to stop it			0
two minutes into the second half @entity2 equalised through that man @entity73 , though they were not level for long as @entity121 got the final touch at an @entity38 corner to deflect @entity125 's header past @entity21 and make it 3 - 2			1
influence : @entity0 scored four of @entity38 's five goals to help his side reach the knockout stages with @entity38 's place in the last 16 secure , @entity131 withdrew @entity0 in the 63rd minute , no doubt wrapping him in cotton wool as soon as he took his place on the bench			1
@entity38 boast some wonderful talents in their squad , including @entity138 and @entity139 , but @entity0 is streets ahead of the pair of them			0
their captain has scored four of his team 's five goals at the tournament , dragging them into the knock - out rounds			0
