@entity0 has admitted that his failure was a direct cause of the deaths of 96 @entity5 fans at the @entity7 disaster the police match commander in charge of @entity5 's @entity11 semi-final with @entity12 in 1989 has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 fans at the @entity7 disaster			1
during the inquest into the deaths today , @entity0 also admitted that he ' froze ' on the day in question , while @entity18 suggested that a child of ' average intelligence ' could have realised the consequences of opening a gate to relieve congestion			1
up to 2,000 fans entered @entity7 stadium 's @entity25 , with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which mr @entity0 had not ordered to be closed			1
they then continued to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing			0
mr @entity33 reminded mr @entity0 of his earlier evidence to @entity35 , counsel for the inquest , about his state of mind after the opening of @entity25 when he told her : ' it was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step			1
my mind for a moment went blank			0
' asked again if he ' froze ' , mr @entity0 said : ' it appears to be a distinct possibility			1
' mr @entity33 said : ' you know what was in your mind and i will ask just one last time			0
will you accept that in fact you froze ? ' mr @entity0 responded : ' yes sir			1
' mr @entity33 went on : ' do you agree with the following , that people died in a crush in the central pens ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' yes sir			1
' mr @entity33 said : ' that if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred ? ' the witness repeated : ' yes sir			0
' @entity5 supporters were crushed to death during an @entity11 semi-final with @entity12 in 1989 @entity5 supporters and family members of the victims of the disaster have long sought justice the barrister continued : ' that closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy			1
' mr @entity0 said again : ' yes sir			1
' mr @entity33 said : ' that you failed to recognise that there was a need to close that tunnel			1
' mr @entity0 said : ' i did fail to recognise that sir			2
' mr @entity33 said : ' and therefore failed to take steps to achieve that			0
' mr @entity0 replied : ' i did sir			2
' a young @entity5 fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the @entity7 pitch mr @entity33 said : ' that failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the @entity7 tragedy			1
' mr @entity0 said : ' yes sir			2
' earlier mr @entity0 had claimed he was unaware of the geography of @entity97 's ground , this being his first match in charge , and denied that he ' bottled it '			2
mr @entity33 , representing the @entity101 , put it the retired police chief : ' do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be ? ' thousands of @entity5 fans hold up scarves during a @entity7 memorial service at @entity114 last year mr @entity0 replied : ' i did not think of it on the day , sir , because of the pressure i was under			1
' mr @entity33 asked : ' is the explanation of your failures mr @entity0 not that you were ignorant of the geography for example but rather that you knew the geography , you knew what the consequences might be of people entering the crowd but you simply froze ? ' the witness replied : ' i am not in a position to make that judgment , sir			2
others should make that judgment			0
' mr @entity33 continued : ' you bottled it			0
you panicked and you failed to take the action that you knew needed to be taken to avoid consequences that you had foreseen			0
now does that describe your state at the time ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' i disagree with you sir			2
' a shirt of local rivals @entity140 is among thousands of flower tributes laid at @entity114 shortly after the disaster ' why ? ' asked mr @entity33			0
mr @entity0 said : ' because that 's my view			2
' the barrister said : ' why is it your view ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' because it is my view and there can be no other view than mine			2
' mr @entity33 said : ' do you accept that might thought to be a rather arrogant thing to say ? ' the witness replied : ' sir i apologise			0
if that appears arrogant i did n't mean that to be so			0
' the inquests have heard that mr @entity0 told the 1989 @entity157 into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were ' grave '			1
chair of the @entity164 , @entity165 , arrives at the inquest last week he has told the jury that his serious failings were due to his lack of experience and that others also played their part in the cause of the deaths			0
mr @entity0 agreed with mr @entity33 that it was ' totally unacceptable ' that a match commander ' did not have a grip on the geography of that ground sufficient to enable you to understand the consequences of your decision making '			2
he also accepted that when giving evidence to @entity186 it appeared that he was aware that the congested @entity188 turnstiles did lead to the central tunnel			0
mr @entity0 said he did not want to go into detail about his ' personal circumstances ' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but it may have been he was ' confused ' when giving evidence in 1989			1
supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the @entity114 gates in @entity5 after the disaster in 1989 mr @entity33 said : ' the other possibility that i put to you is that you did at the time know much more about the geography of that ground and you are seeking to conceal that knowledge from this jury			1
' mr @entity0 said : ' i can assure you , sir , i had no idea where fans would go from a to @entity210 ( turnstiles ) or the opening of @entity213 ' mr @entity33 pointed out that mr @entity0 could have looked at a plan of the ground layout in the police control box before opening the gate at 2.52pm and that he could have consulted a fellow senior colleague with greater experience of the ground			1
a memorial service is held at @entity5 's @entity114 ground on the april 15 , 1989 anniversary of the disaster the barrister told the court that another officer who was in the control box , who was operating the cctv cameras , had earlier told the jury that he thought mr @entity0 was ' not a leader in that control room during that critical period '			1
mr @entity33 asked mr @entity0 : ' do you agree that ( the officer ) was describing a match commander who had frozen ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' it is a possibility , sir , but that is his view and i can not comment further			0
' mr @entity33 said : ' can you not tell us whether on that day in that situation you simply froze ? ' the witness replied : ' sir , i think it is fair to say that we were all in a state of shock			0
' @entity0 agreed with @entity33 that it would be ' disgraceful ' and ' cowardly ' to shift blame for his failings mr @entity33 said : ' you were the one whose job it was to get past any feelings of shock , do you agree ? ' mr @entity0 said : ' yes , sir , but i am human			0
' mr @entity33 said : ' do you agree that you failed to offer any true leadership in that situation on that day ? ' the witness replied : ' that is not my view			0
' earlier , mr @entity0 agreed with mr @entity33 that it would be ' disgraceful ' and ' cowardly ' to try to shift blame for his own failings to officers under his own command			0
the retired chief superintendent of @entity264 has previously said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the @entity269 overlooking the @entity188 terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them			1
but he accepted they had no received formal instructions to do so			0
