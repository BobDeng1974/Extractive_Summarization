@entity1 owner @entity0 has been warned he risks creating a lost generation of supporters if he fails to invest in the club			1
thousands of fans stayed away from sunday 's @entity9 defeat by @entity10 at @entity11 in protest at the way the sportswear @entity15 is running the club , with the official attendance of 47,427 - the capacity of the stadium is in excess of 52,000 - understood to include many season ticket holders who did not attend			1
protesters are calling for a repeat when @entity23 head for @entity24 on saturday , but @entity25 , editor of online fanzine www.themag.co.uk , fears longer - term consequences			1
@entity1 owner @entity0 has been urged to invest in the club or risk losing a generation of fans @entity1 fans hold up ' @entity32 ' banners , mocked in the style of his sports direct chain of stores thousands of @entity1 fans boycotted the club 's last game , a 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity10 on sunday @entity25 , who himself stayed away from sunday 's game , said : ' i feel sorry for young people , what they are watching now and this lack of ambition			1
at least when i was young , the team might have been rubbish and we were going nowhere , but it was exciting to be on the terraces			0
' there was so much more wrapped up in it , whereas now if the football is rubbish , i 'm not quite sure what the lure is			0
' that 's a long - term danger			0
whether @entity0 is here in the future or not , there 's a danger that you are turning all these people off @entity1 and going to the match , especially with the rival attraction of being able to watch it in your local pub. ' unofficial estimates have put the actual attendance for the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity10 at significantly lower than 47,000 , although some have seemed wildly optimistic			1
however , there is little doubt that those who answered calls for a boycott made an impact			0
@entity25 said : ' i thought it was a massive success			2
comparing it with the walk - out at the end of last season , basically it 's always going to be symbolic			0
' it 's not going to bring @entity0 to his knees , but to have thousands and thousands of people , or whatever figure you want to put on it , who have already paid for something not going to the match ... ' imagine thousands of people going to @entity94 or @entity95 's and buying £ 30 worth of shopping and saying , ' hang on a second , i 'm not happy , you can have your shopping back '			1
it 's a massive statement			0
' last week 's revelation that the club banked in excess of £ 34million as well as recording a profit of £ 18.7million for the last financial year has simply served to increase anger among fans , who have seen a squad assembled on a budget struggle to compete during the second half of the current campaign , and not for the first time in recent years			2
@entity10 striker @entity113 nets his 20th league goal of the season to round off a 3 - 1 win over @entity1 a fan holds up a sign protesting against @entity0 's ownership as @entity1 slump to a sixth straight defeat @entity1 midfielder @entity122 ( left ) jostles for possession with @entity10 's @entity124 ( right ) on sunday they have not been placated by head coach @entity127 's insistence that there will be investment during the summer , and an increasingly vocal lobby are demanding that @entity0 sells up			1
@entity25 said : ' when you see the benefits that he 's getting , as well as now profits in each of the last four years and the way that the tv income is going , to those people who say , ' why is n't there a buyer ? there is n't one ' - why would n't there be a buyer ? ' the climate of @entity9 football has totally changed due to these tv deals , and so if you have got a sustainable @entity9 club , especially one with the third biggest attendances , at the right price - and with a willing seller - there is definitely a buyer out there			2
' in the meantime , @entity127 faces the task of attempting to end a run of six successive league defeats , which has left the club just seven points clear of the drop zone , against the @entity158			0
he said : ' i think there 's enough experience to deal with it , yes			0
but we have got to stop losing players , though , sendings - off , injury ... ' @entity1 fans point towards the club 's rude financial health amid poor performances on the pitch			2

@entity1 owner @entity0 is an *unpopular* figure at the club for his *perceived* lack of ambition and investment in the last few years
@entity25 , editor of the @entity1 fanzine , the mag , predicts that unless @entity0 changes his *approach* the club will lose supporters
