as a designer who 's famed for her lady - like glamour and pared down pieces it came as quite a shock to see shrimp emblazoned kimonos making an appearance on @entity10 's @entity9 catwalk			1
attended by a host of celebrity fans including @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity10 's latest collection presented something of a turnaround from her traditional presentations			1
the 39 - year - old @entity21 designer called her newest line an ' evolution at @entity10 ' as the range sees the high - end design merge with @entity27 's diffusion line @entity28			1
@entity10 showcased a relaxed collection of silk kimonos and flat trainers with @entity33 influence including this silk coat which featured a large prawn motif on the back the result was a collection of effortless silhouettes featuring billowing @entity40 , lose suit pants and forgiving waistcoats			1
the models floated down the catwalk with perfect ease as @entity27 presented something that is rarely seen on the catwalk but always well received , flat shoes			2
the line saw a plethora of lose fitting fabrics that @entity27 hopes will transfer from day to night as well as her bold new colour scheme @entity27 presented her typical wash of summer pastels the lace up plimsolls decorated with this season 's key prints from the collection gave the collection a younger a more relaxed feel and made the collection even more appealing as the models seemed more relaxed than ever			1
the bold colour palette featuring tomato oranges and sky blues was inspired by @entity33 @entity70 paintings which showed in the boxy silk jackets lose fitting jackets			1
embroided coral and graphic rope design gave the collection a mermaid vibe the use of flat shoes on the runway gave the models effortlessly relaxed walks the line also saw a nod to @entity27 's more traditional colour combination of pastel pinks and baby blues adding the @entity87 's typical feminine charm			1
the evening wear took on a mermaid like feel with fishnet and graphic rope and encrusted with crystal sea creatures			0
@entity27 believes her latest collection combines the brand 's signature style with a modernist twist			0
' ( it is ) a collection that is wearable with a strong contemporary edge			0
' this collection will see @entity10 's diffusion line , @entity27 combined with the collection @entity14 made an appearance on the front row in thigh high black boots other distinguished guests included @entity108 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) @entity15 made an appearance in a monochrome grey ensemble paired with metallic golden heels @entity10 bought her son out with her to thank the crowd a collection that was inspired by the radiant colours of @entity33 artwork would surely call for equally bold shades of makeup			1
well at least that would be the obvious option			0
however , @entity121 make - up artist to the stars says that the relaxed line needed to be met with equally relaxed beauty			1
' the collection features lots of flat tennis shoes ' says the 39 - year - old beautician ' we wanted the make - up to compliment that			2
pared down beauty was the make - up look for @entity135 ' it would make no sense to have the girls walk down the runway in red lips and heavy make up			2
' the result is bare faced beauty that is actually extremely achievable and requires most attention on building up a healthy complexion			0
' the beauty is very much skin based ' says @entity121 , adding ' we wanted to create sport glossy skin that looks effortless			1
' to create the look @entity121 used nothing more than tinted moisturiser and super balm when describing how to get the look @entity121 explains that using a balm can help achieve the glossy look the girls had on the runway			2
' we have just used tinted moisturiser and a super balm on the lips eyelids and eye brows			0
' the eyebrows continued the trend for bigger is better with @entity121 brushing them up to create more volume			2
other than a high lighting pencil and a eyelash curlers that was the extent of the makeup for @entity10 and yet the models appeared glowing			2
' it 's fresh and sporty and has a strong natural feel ' added @entity121			2
so we can all breath a sigh relief in the knowledge that the no make - up look is hot this season			0

@entity184 's @entity9 collection made a rip roaring debut in the @entity187 show space yesterday			2
the hotly anticipated collection comes from the @entity21 based designer who was previously a member of @entity190			0
her @entity9 inspiration comes from reworking references from throughout the @entity193 and combining them seamlessly into modern fabrics and silhouettes			0
the collection features motifs of @entity200 as a way of demonstrating the unification of east and west as @entity200 is an internationally known brand			0
nostalgic silhouettes and shapes from the past become bound by restyled @entity209 braiding in rubber , based on traditional handmade silk fastenings , and the duality of @entity203 and @entity204 are drawn together in playful , girly multi-layered tea dresses with oversized collars			0
the beauty looks at the show had an oriental influence the @entity9 show saw a star studded front row including ( from left to right ) @entity232 @entity231 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 @entity236 knits , bra - lets and oversized retro graphic prints flirt with social stereotypes of the day			1
