it is understood the @entity107 will be sending a high - profile representative to @entity4 ' planned state memorial service - on a date yet to be announced			2
@entity112 chief executive @entity111 said it was ' out of the question ' that the players should be expected to play a test match a day after the funeral of a respected teammate and treasured friend			1
@entity111 said @entity112 would understand if , for some players , emotions were still too raw next tuesday to face the challenge of test cricket and any player who felt unready for that match could withdraw without recrimination			1
' any player that is not comfortable or does n't feel right , or there is medical advice to suggest they 're not quite right , then we will obviously understand that , ' he said			0

forever in our hearts ' a tribute reading : ' @entity154 ' written on a cricket bat hangs with green and gold ribbons by a sports field in @entity4 ' hometown veteran fast bowler @entity160 became the first player to publicly express misgivings about playing a test match so soon after the tragic death of a team - mate , saying he had n't yet decided whether he would take part			1
@entity160 said wednesday 's service at @entity6 - where the @entity47 sporting colors of green and gold are adorning stores and public buildings around the town - would be an emotional trial for the @entity47 players and only after that could they address their thoughts to the test match			2
' let 's get through that first			0
it 's going to be pretty bloody hard , ' @entity160 told reporters in @entity65			0
' it might be a bit of closure or it might take longer			0
' the thing is no one knows			0
no one has been in this situation before , losing a teammate and a very good mate and trying to play a cricket game less than a week later			2
' @entity160 said players would ' probably like a little bit longer ' to reconcile their emotions before facing a test preparation			0
' but that is reality , ' he said			0
' there 's a test series on and there are games to be played , that 's what we have to prepare for			0
but at least we have a date to work towards			0
' a cricket bat and cap are tied to a fence outside @entity4 ' former school in @entity6 a tribute to @entity4 marked on the hill at the home ground of his former country club at @entity216 in the week since @entity4 ' passing , @entity0 has become a lightning rod for the emotions of his team and his nation			1
@entity0 may not have been a universally popular figure in the past and his relationship with @entity112 had been strained by his unorthodox efforts to prove his fitness for the first test after a hamstring injury			2
but all of those issues and impressions have been swept aside by the manner in which @entity0 has comported himself since the death of a teammate he said was ' like a brother to me			2
' in articulately and unashamedly expressing his own grief , he made it possible for his team - mates and compatriots to grieve			0
@entity0 will draw from the same well of emotion when he addresses wednesday 's funeral service at the recreation hall of the @entity40 , close to the banana plantation on which @entity4 was raised .			1
