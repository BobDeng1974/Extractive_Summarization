@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned that @entity2 face the threat of another cup upset on wednesday , claiming that @entity6 teams do n’t take the knock - out competitions as seriously as those in the lower divisions			1
@entity10 and @entity11 crashed out of the @entity12 on a weekend of shocks that also saw @entity2 lose at home to @entity15			1
now @entity0 wants to pile on the misery for @entity18 ’s side by guiding his @entity20 underdogs to victory in the @entity24 semi-final second leg at @entity25			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 ( left ) has warned @entity2 they face the threat of another cup upset @entity0 wants to cause an upset against @entity18 ( right ) in the @entity24 semi-final the 48 - year - old believes that @entity11 ’s decision to take a long - haul flight back from @entity33 the day before their shock defeat against @entity35 is typical of how top - flight teams and their players view the domestic cup competitions			1
‘ i think it ’s all down to the @entity6 lads not taking the cups as seriously as the other players , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the cups are so important to lower - league players , and i do n’t think that ’s matched in the @entity6			1
‘ i do n’t think they regard it with the same importance , even when they put a full side out			2
‘ @entity51 want to do is their business , but to have a seven - and - a - half - hour flight the day before a game ? i wonder if they ’d do that for a @entity59 game			2
‘ would they fly back on friday from @entity33 before they play @entity10 this saturday ? ‘ we can take inspiration from the weekend , certainly			1
it puts everyone on high alert			0
anyone now who is facing a lower - league team , do n’t take them lightly because , on their day , they can do things like saturday			1
‘ @entity70 started it off ( drawing at @entity72 ) on friday night			0
things like that give you belief and inspiration			0
you watch a game and you go to bed thinking “ come on , we can do this tomorrow ”			0
it ’s amazing how it works in players ’ minds			0
’ @entity84 handled the ball inside his own penalty area in the 74th minute to give @entity2 a penalty @entity88 stepped up and converted to put @entity2 ahead with just over 15 minutes to play @entity88 jumps for joy after scoring the penalty to give @entity2 a first - leg lead over @entity1 @entity0 ’s side trail @entity2 1 - 0 from the first - leg but he has yet to lose a cup tie at home during his 15 months in charge of the @entity96			1
the @entity98 club progressed to the @entity12 semi-finals at @entity100 last season and have already beaten three @entity6 teams – @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 – in the knockout tournaments in this campaign			1
@entity0 is determined to make life as uncomfortable as possible for his opponents at a packed @entity25			2
‘ we ’re at home and 25,000 of the 30,000 will be cheering us on , that will make a difference , ’ he added			2
‘ it ’s a different kind of atmosphere and a different kind of football than they ’ re used to			0
even in the big @entity6 games , it can be a little bit of a damp squib			2
‘ the pitch quality is n’t as good as they ’re used to playing on week in , week out			0
we ’ve got to make it everything they ’re not comfortable with			0
‘ i ’m sure @entity2 will be aware of the sort of game it could be for them			2
there ’s a few lads who ’ve been out on loan and they ’ll know what it ’s about – @entity139 , ( @entity88 ) @entity88 , ( @entity141 ) @entity140 , ( @entity142 ) @entity143 ’s a good young @entity144 midfielder , @entity143			0
they ’ve got a few with that sort of experience and they ’re probably going to need it			0
’ however , @entity0 is refusing to look beyond tonight ’s tie to the possibility of a @entity100 return on march 1			1
‘ i ’ve honestly not even thought about getting that far , ’ admitted			0
‘ i was speaking to the chairman at @entity153 about getting together for lunch on a sunday and he said “ give us a couple of dates ”			0
‘ i gave him a couple and he said “ that one ’s okay , but the other one , i ’m hoping to be cheering you on at @entity100 ! ”			0
