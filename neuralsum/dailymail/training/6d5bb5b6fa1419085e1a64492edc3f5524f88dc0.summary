by @entity0 the parents of a four - year - old with a fatal degenerative illness are desperately trying to raise enough money for a clinical trial into a potential cure			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , has @entity9 , which means she will stop speaking in about six months time			1
she will then lose the ability to walk and look after herself and she is unlikely to survive into her teens			1
but , there is no money to pay for the treatment to be produced and trialled			1
as a result , @entity7 's parents , @entity23 , 41 , and @entity24 , 39 , are trying to raise the necessary $ 1 million before it is too late to save their daughter			1
on the fundraising video , which has gone viral , mr @entity28 says : ' you know where it 's heading - it 's heading towards suffering , it 's headed towards pain for her and as a father you want to be able to protect your children			2
' this trial really is the only chance she has			2
' @entity7 seemed completely health for the first two or three years of her life but then her parents and teachers began to notice her development was slightly delayed			1
@entity23 and @entity47 have raised more than half a million dollars in the past two weeks thanks to a viral video which helps explain their plight of their 4 - year - old daughter @entity7			1
they are pictured with @entity7 and her older brother , @entity54 until @entity7 was about three , she was thought to be perfectly health			1
she was only diagnosed after starting to show signs of developmental delay			0
currently she is healthy but will soon start to deteriorate they thought she might have autism or a mild learning disability			2
however , a geneticist friend of mrs @entity7 suggested that it was worth having a genetic test done just in case			1
@entity65 is a metabolism disorder which is passed down through families			0
it occurs when the enzymes that are needed to break down heparan sulfate sugar chains are missing or defective			0
this causes the toxic substance to build up in the body and brain			0
sufferers are initially healthy but start to show signs of a decline in learning ability between the ages of two and six			2
they then slowly deteriorate and those with @entity9 - the most severe form - often do not survive into their teens			2
children can only inherit the condition if both of their parents are carriers - in that situation , the child has a 25 per cent chance of being a sufferer			2
mr and mrs @entity7 were so unconcerned at this stage that mr @entity28 did not even attend the appointment when the results were given			2
however , mrs @entity7 , herself a paediatrician , was told the horrifying news that @entity7 had @entity65			2
she said : ' this is really bad , this is really bad			0
' but she added : ' we do n't just have hope , there is something very real that exists that with enough money will happen and will happen in time for our @entity7			1
' it 's not a question of if this can happen , this will happen			0
' she explained that @entity113 , in @entity114 , has developed a treatment that is thought to be able to cure the illness			1
the hospital is ready to go ahead with a clinical trial - which @entity7 could be part of - but needs $ 1 million to fund it			1
children with @entity122 have a mutation of a gene which allows for the production of an enzyme essential for normal cellular function			0
because the children lack this enzyme , over time a toxic material called heparan sulfate builds up in their brains and bodies leading to severe disability and death before they even reach their teens			0
if @entity28 and mrs @entity7 can raise enough money , @entity7 could take part in the clinical trial which could mean a one - off treatment prevents her ever developing symptoms the response to the @entity7 video has surpassed her family 's wildest expectations as news of their daughter 's plight has spread around the globe however , the hospital has developed a treatment which involves the child being given just one intravenous treatment			1
they are given a substance that diffuses throughout the brain clearing the build up of heparan sulfate and preventing the development of symptoms			0
the treatment also prevents further build up of the toxic substance meaning one treatment could be enough to prevent the child ever developing symptoms			1
on learning about the treatment , @entity28 and mrs @entity7 launched a fundraising campaign			1
a @entity169 photographer and filmmaker called @entity171 heard about their plight and offered to help them by making a video about @entity7			2
the video was released on @entity176 on april 2 and has helped the family raise nearly $ 400,000 to date			1
' we do n't want to be two years from now and say as parents that we left anything on the table , ' said @entity182 about the plight of their young daughter the money being raised is going towards trials to be run at the @entity113 in @entity114 it has been viewed 140,000 times on @entity176 since being posted			1
mr @entity28 told @entity190 : ' the comments we are getting from around the world are just amazing			0
the outpouring is just incredible			0
‘ it 's unbelievable – we are completely overwhelmed with emotion			0
we could say thank you a million times over and it would n’t be enough			0
’ he added : ' i was absolutely moved by the video but had no idea people are willing to help			0
' it ’s just people are good – they want to help			0
' we are going to know by the end of the year whether this will work – it ’s a miracle story in the making			0
if we can stop it , and stop it soon – wow			0
’ to donate , visit @entity213			0

@entity7 , four , suffers from @entity215
she is currently healthy but will soon lose the ability to speak
she will then stop walking and will no *longer* be able to look after herself
without *pioneering* treatment she will not live into her teens
@entity113 in @entity224 , @entity114 , has a potential cure
but , it does not have the money to create and trial the treatment
@entity7 's family are trying to raise the money before her condition worsens
if they manage to do so , @entity7 could take part in a trial of the treatment which could prevent her developing any symptoms
