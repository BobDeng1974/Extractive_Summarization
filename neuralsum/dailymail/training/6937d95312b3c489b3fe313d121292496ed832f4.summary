by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 is posing for pictures on @entity5 quayside with a group of children whose parents were possibly not born when he was @entity11 ’s best , winning our only track and field medal of the @entity12 in @entity13			1
the long sideburns are gone , stubble shaved and the unkempt mane of dark hair is grey and brushed			1
his off - white cotton running vests — which back then revealed thick tufts of chest hair — are stored away , replaced by a smart navy blue suit and tie			1
this is @entity2 the businessman , the raconteur who can pick up the phone to @entity31 , @entity32 , or @entity33 to ask a favour			1
one in a million : @entity2 , who had the idea for the @entity36 , is celebrating the event 's millionth runner best known as the distinctive @entity40 voice of athletics , @entity2 is most proud of his days as a brave frontrunner			1
he gritted it out in an era where systematic doping was as much a part of track and field as running spikes			2
but perhaps what will prove his greatest legacy is written in giant lettering on the @entity53 , just behind him as he poses for pictures			2
@entity55 ’ reads the sign			2
the event , which @entity2 conceived of during a twilight run on an @entity60 beach with his friend @entity61 , will pass its one - millionth runner on sunday			1
more than 56,000 will set off from the heart of @entity64 for the 34th edition of the biggest mass participation sport event in the world			1
the @entity68 will be second to reach a million and the @entity70 marathon follows in two years			1
‘ we did n’t realise until we started doing the numbers , ’ recalls @entity2			1
‘ then we got in touch with all the other major events and said to them , “ so how many have you got ? ” if you ’re from @entity64 , you do n’t really beat @entity77 in anything , so it ’s a proud moment for the @entity80			2
’ back then : @entity2 ran as an amateur and says he feels sorry for modern , professional athletes @entity2 looks out from the glass - fronted @entity5 building , the heart of @entity86 ’s arts scene , and gestures to the landscape that has made him tick down the years			1
from behind modern tower blocks peeks the upper tier of @entity91 , where , since he was seven , many happy and some despondent afternoons have been spent cheering his beloved @entity94			2
he ran on the riverbanks as a teenager , while part of @entity98			2
trained by a local welder , @entity99 , @entity2 became @entity11 ’s best long - distance runner before the public had heard of @entity102 , @entity103 or @entity104			1
a chemistry teacher , he broke world records over two miles and 3,000 metres			2
‘ when i broke the ( two - mile ) world record at @entity109 in 1973 i was teaching ( at @entity111 ’s @entity110 in @entity112 ) , ’ he says			2
‘ there were guys who were joiners , carpenters , welders and bank workers			2
eventually you got a few quid but it was nothing more than pocket money			2
record breaker : the long - distance runner broke the world record at two miles and 3,000 metres in the 1970s last time out : @entity128 wins the 2013 @entity36 ahead of @entity11 's @entity129 ‘ i feel sorry for some professional athletes now because if they do n’t run fast they ca n’t pay their mortgage			1
we were less conventional , we did n’t have to do good interviews or thank the sponsors			2
’ @entity2 was adored for his no - nonsense northern attitude , which drew comparisons with a series of 1970s cartoons titled ‘ tough of @entity139			1
’ the main character @entity140 , with his wild looks , bore a resemblance to @entity2			1
‘ @entity140 was a typical northern lad			2
he ate fish and chips , beat the toffs and overcame the establishment			2
maybe some i ran against would say i was the tough lad of the track , but it was n’t about being toughest , just being fastest			2
’ there are still no airs and graces with @entity2			1
he litters his stories with ‘ i should stop , i ’m telling you too much , ’ but free - flowing honesty is the only way he knows			0
it has made life difficult for him at times in the commentary box , like when he laid into a young @entity129 after he won a mile race on the same weekend as the @entity36 several years ago , before he made his breakthrough			1
‘ i said : “ what on earth are you doing ? you need to get a proper coach and a new set - up			0
” he had a hell of a finish , he just did n’t have a clue how to win a race			0
’ @entity175 hero : at the 1976 @entity176 was the only @entity11 medalist in track and field @entity129 nonsense : @entity2 laid into a young @entity129 but the @entity11 star has taken his advice on board his plain talking is what has made @entity2 such an enduring broadcaster , having commentated on every major athletics event since 1983			1
he learned from the peerless @entity188 , who died last year			0
‘ he invited me to join him in the commentary box , ’ says @entity2 , ‘ i did n’t realise until i sat next to others that i ’d been next to a @entity192			1
if that ’s your first car you do n’t appreciate it until you ’ve had a @entity195			0
’ at last month ’s @entity196 , @entity2 was a rare voice on @entity198 to stick up for the @entity200 steeplechaser @entity201 , who was harshly stripped of his gold medal for ripping off his shirt on the final straight while a long way clear			1
‘ i ’ve seen @entity208 score and his celebrations were understated , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ just because another goes mental does n’t mean they should get a prison sentence			0
‘ the rebel in me liked him ripping his shirt off			0
athletics ca n’t always be a function of how hard you try but it has to be a fair reward for what you ’ve achieved			0
he did n’t get fair reward because he ’s a bit crackers			0
@entity129 is getting fair reward now for years of unfailing effort			0
‘ i believe in a meritocracy			0
i guess it ’s based on my history			0
i lost a gold to a guy who cheated			0
it does n’t affect my life but i wish i had n’t			0
’ @entity2 is used to battling against the tide , having competed at a time when athletics was rotten with drugs cheats			1
different era : @entity2 claims athletics is a much cleaner sport these days than when he was competing ‘ the entire nation of @entity239 was designed to win medals by fair means or foul , ’ he says			1
‘ a guy i used to run against a lot was ( @entity239 ) @entity245 but we were n’t allowed to speak , we could n’t swap vests , he was always whisked away after races			0
' i used to go to training with him on my mind but i could never physically get to meet @entity252 are a lot better in that regard now , the authorities have taken a stand against drugs			0
there will always be some but it ’s nowhere near as bad			0
’ after his running career , @entity2 set up @entity260 , a company which holds dozens of mass - participation sport events across the country with more than 200,000 people a year taking part in runs , swims and bike rides			1
now 66 , and a grandfather of two , he is still trim and runs four times a week			0
‘ i go with my mate who lives across the road , ’ he says			0
‘ he ’s 75 , we ’ve been running together for 20 years and have both got progressively slower			0
it ’s hilly where we live so now we walk up the hills and run on the tops			0
’ he still lives in @entity64 and has a holiday home in the nearby town of @entity280			0
‘ i go to the local butcher to get the meat for the weekend and he ’ll ask me what i ’ve been up to and it ’s lovely			0
’ @entity2 believes the region and the @entity80 in general is often given short shrift			1
‘ there ’s a significant problem in this country , it ’s that @entity70 is everything and everywhere else is nothing , ’ he says			0
by way of example , he recounts a piece of advice given to him by @entity297 , then editor of @entity298 , about how to raise the profile of the @entity36			1
‘ about 15 years ago , it was the biggest event in the country			1
we had the best athletes and celebrities			0
i said , “ how can we get promotion or on to your programme ? ” he said : “ the best thing you could do is take @entity80 out of the title and people in the @entity313 will be more receptive ”			0
‘ i was in the same class at school as @entity297 , he ’s a good lad and was giving me proper advice			0
but that made me even more determined to make it work and make sure everyone knows about it			0
’ the @entity36 , televised on @entity198 , is @entity11 ’s biggest running event			1
the @entity260 event will become the first of its kind to celebrate its one - millionth finish			1
