by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:29 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 08:44 est , 20 february 2013 @entity2 was today putting the finishing touches to what could be the most important product launch in its history			1
the @entity8 console is set to be unveiled in @entity9 at 11pm tonight			1
the struggling electronics giant hopes the next generation console will help it regain market share against @entity13 , who is yet to reveal plans for its new xbox console - which is also expected to be on sale in time for @entity19			1
touch me : this apparently leaked image purports to show the controller for the hotly anticipated @entity8 , which @entity2 is expected to announce at an event to be held in @entity9 next wednesday although no details have been confirmed by @entity2 , the @entity8 's main features are believed to include : the unveiling will excite millions of computer games fans across the world , and further fuel the on - going battle between @entity2 , @entity31 manufacturers @entity13 and @entity32 , the makers of the @entity34 system			1
experts say the event is critical to @entity2 's future			1
' for @entity2 , they have to come out and make this @entity8 event the definitive statement of why gamers need to adopt the @entity8 or @entity8 or whatever they end up calling it , ' said @entity41 , @entity42 executive editor at video game site @entity44			1
' their focus is on establishing a beachhead for the next generation of consoles , and that 's what feb. 20 is all about , " said @entity45 , ceo and founder of @entity47			0
' the reality is they have been playing catch - up			0
' since the first @entity42 console launched in december 1994 , @entity2 have sold over 310 million home consoles worldwide , and 2.9 billion games			1
pictures allegedly showing the new ps4 controller reveal the device will incorporate a touchscreen built into the middle of the familiar dualshock layout			0
it has also been rumoured the console will cost £ 270 in an attempt to undercut rivals			1
electronics giant @entity2 is holding an event in @entity9 , during which it promised to reveal ' the future '			1
but the games manufacturer has refused to confirm widespread rumours that the latest version of the console will be launched			0
leaked photographs which have emerged online appear to show a prototype controller with a touchpad alongside the classic @entity81 - style controls have fuelled the speculation			0
the touchscreen is at the front , where the start and select buttons are found on the current generation of @entity42 controllers			0
the image appears to back up rumours circulating earlier this week which added @entity92 and @entity94 buttons have also been remodelled and improved			0
pushing ahead of @entity13 's @entity95 and @entity32 's new @entity96 could help @entity2 revive an electronics business hurt by a dearth of hit gadgets , a collapse in tv sales and the convergence of consumer interest around tablets and smartphones built by rivals @entity107 and @entity108			1
tablets and smartphones already account for around 10 percent of the $ 80 billion gaming market			0
those mobile devices , analysts predict , will within a few years be as powerful as the current slew of game - only consoles			0
@entity2 has slashed the price of its struggling @entity119 handheld games console in @entity120 in a bid to spur sales of the device			1
the maker of @entity8 consoles trimmed the price of its @entity128 version by 10,000 yen ( $ 110 ) to 19,980 yen , with all other models also reduced , it said in a statement			2
@entity2 this month trimmed its forecast for handheld sales , including the @entity119 and older @entity133 , to 7 million machines in the year ending march 31 compared with an estimate of 16 million at the start of the business term			2
@entity2 has kept its cards close to its chest regarding the expected launch , so far only officially releasing a teaser video via @entity142 announcing date of the event and calling on gamers to ' be the first to know '			1
the video also promoted a @entity148 hashtag , # @entity147 , to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event			0
asked about the purpose of the event , @entity152 , a spokesman for the company said only : ' we will be talking about the @entity42 business			0
' tantalising : a still from @entity2 's teaser video , published on @entity142 on january 31 , announcing the date of its event on ' the future of the playstation ' to be held in @entity9 next week console rival @entity13 is also believed to be gearing to launch its successor to the @entity31 , which is codenamed @entity163 , though it is understood the @entity165 giant is likely to delay announcement of the machine until the @entity169 show in june			1
observers expect both systems to be on the shelves in time for @entity19 , which could mean a battle for supremacy between @entity13 and @entity2 as their next - generation consoles go head - to - head in the vital holiday season market			1
due for an update : @entity13 is expected to announce the successor to its @entity31 console at june 's @entity169 , in time for a @entity19 launch date it has been more than six years since @entity2 launched the 70million - selling @entity182 , a longer gap than between it and its @entity184 predecessor , adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept			1
the last time @entity2 held a @entity42 event , in january 2011 , it presented a protoype of its handheld @entity119 console			2
before that , it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the @entity182 concept			0
a meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the @entity184			0
rumours surfaced last week that the new machine would be heavily focused on the cloud , which would put the @entity120 firm 's purchase last year of a leading cloud - based gaming company into perspective			0
@entity2 paid $ 380million for @entity202 in june last year			2
at the time @entity2 's chief executive , @entity203 , said : ' by combining @entity202 's resources including its technological strength and engineering talent with @entity204 's [ @entity204 ] extensive game platform knowledge and experience , @entity204 will provide users with unparalleled cloud entertainment experiences			2
' @entity204 will deliver a world - class cloud - streaming service that allows users to instantly enjoy a broad array of content ranging from immersive core games with rich graphics to casual content anytime , anywhere on a variety of internet - connected devices			0
' the @entity119 : the portable console , successor to the @entity133 , was unveiled the last time @entity2 held a @entity42 event , in january 2011 as well as the touchpad controller , the new console is expected to have an eight - core x64 @entity229 processor ( codenamed ' @entity230 ) , @entity231 of @entity232 , @entity233 of video ram , four usb ports that use the new high - speed usb 3.0 standard , a blu - ray drive , a hard drive of @entity239 , an @entity240 , and both @entity242 and optical outputs			1
specs for the next - generation @entity95 are rumored to be comparable , with insiders suggesting that it will also pack @entity245 of @entity232 , @entity242 connectors and usb 3.0			0
however , video gamers have been horrified by rumours that the @entity13 machine will only work with the @entity252 sensor plugged in and that it will only run games registered to the machine - potentially blocking not only second - hand games but also games borrowed from friends			1
the co-founder of @entity95 has launched a scathing attack on @entity13 for ' five years of failure ' - and claimed that @entity107 could ‘ kill them ’ at any given moment			2
former xbox engineer @entity263 - who came up with the console ’s name ( albeit spelled @entity266 ) - slammed @entity13 for failing to capitalise on innovations such as @entity252 and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device			1
the attack follows reports that @entity13 are likely to announce their @entity31 successor , codenamed @entity275 , at @entity169 in @entity276 in june this year			1
writing on his blog ilike.code , under the title ‘ stupid , @entity266 ’ , @entity263 said : ‘ the past 5 years , and the last year in particular , have been simply painful to watch			0
' coasting on past momentum			0
failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like @entity252			2
touting strategic and market success when you ’re just experiencing your competitor ’s stumbling failure ( yes , @entity2 , @entity32 – you are , i ’m afraid , stumbling failures )			2
' a complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room			0
’ the @entity8 could cost as little as £ 270 when it launches later this year , according to a report in a @entity120 newspaper			1
the @entity292 reported that @entity2 's new gaming console will cost 40,000 yen - which translates to about £ 270			1
however , @entity295 gamers will have to factor in @entity296 , which adds a whopping 20 per cent to the price , taking the possible @entity295 figure to around £ 325			2
even at that price , the @entity8 will be a @entity182 cost 60,000 yen when it launched in @entity120 2006			2
the new console is expected to be announced at a press conference in @entity9 on february 20			2
if the price is as low as the rumours suggest , it could steal a march on @entity13 's next - generation xbox console , which does n't yet have a launch date			1
@entity13 's console , which could be named the @entity95 720 , could be announced at the annual @entity169 gaming conference , held in @entity276 in june			1
observers expect it to be on the shelves in time for @entity19 , which could mean a battle for supremacy between @entity13 and @entity2			1
the launches are important for both companies , as gamers have moved away from consoles since the @entity31 and the @entity182 débuted			0
more and more people have shifted to tablets and smartphones as a gaming platform			0
analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today 's games consoles within a few years			0
many are already able to run the kinds of @entity331 games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high - spec gaming @entity333 last hurrah : the @entity335			0
@entity2 are still actively marketing the console , and are releasing it in two different colours tomorrow @entity338 : the @entity340 ' super-slim ' units may represent one last push of their current gen hardware despite next - gen rumours and stiff competition from mobile devices , @entity2 are still actively marketing the @entity346			2
the company today released the console in two different colours			0
the new limited edition @entity350 and @entity340 ' super-slim ' units seem to represent one last push of their current generation hardware .			0

launch will be shown live on @entity358 from 11pm tonight
@entity2 claims it will reveal ' the future ' with new console , which was codenamed ' @entity8 '
expected to go on sale in *november* , with reports of a £ 270 price tag , and come with camera to compete with @entity13 's @entity252
