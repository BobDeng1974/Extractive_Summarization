by @entity0 for @entity1 learning lines from @entity3 need not be boring after a father found a way to help his daughter learn a monologue from @entity8			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , filmed his daughter @entity6 saying a line from the play in different locations over the course of 18 months			1
the two - and - a - half minute video opens with the famous line ' all the world 's a stage ' as @entity6 plays on a roundabout			2
the camera then flicks to @entity6 playing tabletop game @entity23 as she declares : ' and all the men and women merely players			0
' further scenes show @entity6 in a location relevant to the line she is speaking			2
she holds open a door and says earnestly : ' they have their exits and their entrances			0
' other shots feature @entity6 in a variety of location from the middle of the sea to the school run			0
