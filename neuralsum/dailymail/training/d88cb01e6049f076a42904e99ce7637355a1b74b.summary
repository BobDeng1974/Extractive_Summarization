by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 16:35 est , 2 june 2013 a mother of three is facing death after being refused a breakthrough cancer treatment			1
@entity4 , 43 , who has been fighting breast cancer for five years , was denied the treatment because of a recent @entity8 funding clampdown			1
just two months ago , she would have got a new type of radiation therapy , but she was not referred to hospital until it was too late			1
mother of three : @entity4 ( pictured with her three boys , @entity14 , 13 , @entity15 , eight , and seven - year - old @entity16 ) is determined not to lose the chance of spending more time with her family she had gone to her @entity21 surgery 15 times with telltale symptoms that her cancer had spread to her liver – but was told she was probably too young for that to have happened			1
the therapy , which could halve mrs @entity4 ’s tumours , was cut from the @entity30 list of treatments in april			1
in a further bitter twist , the radiation would even save the @entity8 money as it costs less than the chemotherapy she is having – which is failing to work			1
now mrs @entity4 , her partner @entity37 , 47 , and three boys , @entity14 , 13 , @entity15 , eight , and seven - year - old @entity16 are determined not to lose the chance of spending more time together			2
she said : ‘ time is of the essence , and i do n’t understand why i and women like me can be refused funding – it is grossly unfair			0
‘ when this nightmare started and i had to tell my boys that i had cancer , i promised them that i would do everything and anything in my power to stay with them for as long as i possibly could			0
i was elated when i discovered there was a real chance of extending my life , but it has turned to despair			0
‘ my oncologist says i need to be treated within the next month , and i will fight this decision – i am fighting for my life			0
’ mrs @entity4 , who lives near @entity58 , @entity59 , had pinned her hopes on a breakthrough treatment called @entity62 , known as @entity62 , in which millions of tiny radioactive beads are injected into the artery that supplies the cancer			1
battle : @entity62 only became available in @entity66 via the @entity30 two years ago after a fight by doctor @entity68 ( pictured ) , who was denied it by a local trust			1
she died last year it only became available in @entity66 via the @entity30 two years ago after a fight by doctor @entity68 , who was denied it by a local trust			2
she eventually got treatment after a u-turn but died in may last year			0
since then @entity62 has been axed pending a review – a decision which could stop up to 500 patients getting it this year			0
doctors can make funding requests for ‘ exceptional ’ patients , but two attempts to get treatment for mrs @entity4 have been rejected			1
' @entity39 is of the essence , and i do n’t understand why i and women like me can be refused funding – it is grossly unfair ' @entity4 when first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 , aged 39 , she made the brave decision to also have her healthy breast removed because cases of cancer in the family meant odds were stacked against her			1
despite the operation , by october 2010 mrs @entity4 felt very unwell and feared the cancer had spread			2
but it took 15 visits to @entity101 and a private @entity102 before a huge mass was found on her liver			0
she said she was ‘ over the moon ’ when her doctor said @entity62 treatment might reduce the liver tumours by 50 per cent and prolong her life ‘ by many months ’			2
but mrs @entity4 ’s medical team at hospitals in @entity113 and @entity114 were told last week by @entity66 , which oversees such requests , they were not allowed to treat her			2
she said : ‘ i was so shocked			0
i did n’t think it would be a problem as the @entity8 is paying for my chemo which is very expensive and is n’t working			0
what can i do to be more “ exceptional ” ? ' i still have three children at school			0
’ the family now face the daunting task of raising £ 45,000 for private treatment – when the @entity8 cost is around £ 14,000			2
she added : ‘ my grandmother , who is now expected to outlive her granddaughter , always said “ value your health ” … i just wish the @entity8 would give me the chance to do that			0

@entity4 , of @entity59 , has been fighting breast cancer for five years
she was denied treatment because of recent @entity8 funding clampdown
just two months ago she would have got new type of radiation therapy
but mother of four , 43 , was not referred to hospital until it was too late
