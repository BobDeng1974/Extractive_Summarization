by @entity0 click here to read more on a busy weekend for @entity3 's scouts across @entity4 , including a trip to watch @entity7 score for @entity8 ... @entity8 are continuing to show interest in @entity11 defender @entity10			1
the @entity12 is looking to open talks over a new contract at @entity15 and is keen to stay but the wealthy @entity17 club are monitoring developments			1
@entity19 is a big fan of @entity10 and would not want to let him go but the next contract is a crucial one for a player who turned 30 last month			2
his current deal has two years to run but early negotiations are underway with @entity10 seen as a key senior figure			2
in - demand : @entity11 long - serving @entity12 defender @entity10 is wanted by @entity8 @entity11 will take decisions over the future of @entity29 and @entity30 over coming weeks as well as @entity31			1
it is understood @entity31 could trigger another year option if he plays a set amount of games but that seems unlikely with @entity19 's current team selection			2
@entity29 and @entity30 are expected to be offered one - year options but @entity31 is ready to leave with @entity38 of @entity39 expected to arrive in the summer			1
@entity38 thing : @entity11 are expected to move for the @entity39 left back ( left ) in the summer moving on ? @entity31 ( left ) has fallen out of favour at @entity11 this season otherwise it is a relatively young @entity11 squad and @entity10 will play a pivotal role in the dressing room for @entity19 over the coming years			1
@entity8 have made no secret of their admiration for @entity10 but realising his affection for @entity11 have also considered his team - mate @entity48 , who is again figuring on the list of targets for @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity53 wants players with @entity56 competition experience to fit in alongside @entity57 with former @entity11 defender @entity58 possibly moving on to @entity59 depending how his own contract talks go			1
in the market : @entity8 boss @entity53 is looking for defensive reinforcements this summer @entity11 rebuff loan interest in young @entity65 star @entity64 @entity66 and @entity67 are set to be disappointed in their pursuit of @entity11 youngster @entity64			1
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 all made enquiries in january and were given a similar response with @entity11 keen to keep the 19 - year - old at @entity15			1
signed from @entity76 in 2011 , @entity64 was @entity11 's young player of the year in 2013			1
he can play left - back , centre back or centre midfield and @entity11 want the @entity65 under 21 international to qualify as a homegrown player			1
@entity66 and @entity67 are both interested in taking him on loan but he is set to continue his development with @entity11 's @entity84 and first team squad			1
@entity65 of class : @entity11 have high hopes for versatile defender @entity64 @entity88 links up with former @entity90 team - mate @entity89 at @entity72 former @entity90 and @entity3 goalkeeper @entity88 has linked up with @entity89 as chief scout at @entity72			1
@entity88 , 52 , who also played for @entity71 , @entity92 and @entity93 , had been scouting for @entity94 among other clubs			1
he replaces @entity96 who left @entity72 on thursday			2
@entity89 is also keen to bring in former @entity98 coach @entity97 in a director of football role			2
@entity100 , meanwhile , have recruited former @entity102 scout @entity101 who was chief scout at @entity94 with @entity103 , he will work alongside @entity104			1
scouting mission : @entity88 ( right ) worked with sir @entity106 at @entity3 @entity107 released by @entity108 @entity110 young striker @entity109 has been released by @entity108 to give him the maximum opportunity to find another club			2
@entity107 , signed from @entity113 , was told he can go by manager @entity114 as he looks to shake - up his squad for next season			0
@entity109 - who was brought to the club by previous manager @entity118 - has spent this season out on loan at @entity120 , where he was twice voted player of the month , and @entity122			0
@entity107 , 19 , has this week been offered a contract by @entity125 manager @entity124 until the end of the season , after his loan came to an end			2
former @entity39 midfielder @entity124 has agreed to allow @entity107 to trial for interested @entity131 clubs too as part of the deal			2
@entity125 are in play - off contention in seventh place in the @entity136 but have three games in hand on some of their rivals			0
@entity141 keen to stay in @entity142 @entity93 defender @entity141 is keen on a permanent return to @entity142 after impressing during his loan spell			1
the 23 - year - old has been a dependable figure under @entity147 since joining from @entity148 in december			0
the @entity149 made just nine appearance for @entity148 and despite the attraction of @entity152 is hoping his performances for @entity93 will lead to a bid in the summer			2
one problem though is it is understood that former @entity93 sporting director @entity157 did not negotiate an option to buy for the club so there is a risk his valuation will increase and that could allow other interested @entity164 sides to step in			0
