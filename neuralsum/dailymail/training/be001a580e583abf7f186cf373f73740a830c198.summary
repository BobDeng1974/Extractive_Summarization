her parents , @entity12 and @entity13 , could n't hold her for three months and were told to expect the worst			1
@entity7 ( pictured with mother , @entity13 ) was born 13 weeks early weighing just 1.4lbs at @entity15 they were even given the option of switching off her life support seven times			1
however , they never gave up hope of her recovering and following four major operations their seven - month - old daughter is now on the road to recovery			1
her father , @entity12 , 31 , of @entity15 , said : ‘ the doctors took us to a small room in the hospital seven times to ask us if we would consider turning her life support machine off because she was n't going to make it			0
‘ they were just making sure we were aware of the situation and letting us know that they should probably just stop treatment now as they were only prolonging her life by a week or two			0
‘ but we told them we could n't give up on her			2
that 's why we think she is a miracle , because nobody told us that she was going to make it			2
‘ the probabilities of her recovery were very , very slim but we are so happy to see @entity49 the way she is now - she keeps surprising us with her progress			0
’ she was so unwell that her parents , @entity12 and @entity13 , could n't hold her for three months and were told to expect the worst - doctors even suggested seven times that her life support was turned off she had four major operations shortly after her birth because she developed a bleed on the brain , a serious eye condition and numerous infections when the baby was born at @entity15 at 24 weeks in october she was the size of her father ’s hand			1
she went through four major operations in the first few weeks of her life as she suffered bleeding on the brain and a number of serious infections			1

her parents refused to give up hope and kept deciding to give her a chance of survival			2
she is now seven - months - old and her parents describe her as a ' miracle ' @entity77 's parents do not know whether she will ever be able to walk or talk but say that they continue to hope that she will be able to lead an independent life mr @entity79 , who is originally from @entity80 , said : ‘ the progress she 's made is quite remarkable			0
there 's a photo when she 's a few weeks old and she 's smaller than my hand			0
‘ @entity77 's chances of survival were rated at 30 per cent , then 10 per cent and then we were told she was n't going to make it through the night			0
‘ i 'm not blaming the doctors , as they were just being honest about what they believed at the time , but we live in hope that @entity77 can continue to surprise them			0
‘ we do n't know if she will ever be able to walk or talk , it 's just too early , but we 're still keeping our hope that she will be able to lead an independent life			0
