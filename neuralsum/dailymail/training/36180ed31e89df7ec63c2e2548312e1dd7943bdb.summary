@entity1 hooker @entity0 is the latest player to be ruled out of @entity3 ’s tour of @entity4 , in order to be with his wife while she is being treated for a serious illness			1
the 27 - year - old will be left out of a 40 - man squad to be named later this month and head coach @entity10 said : ‘ our thoughts are with @entity0 and @entity12 at this time and it is entirely right that he stays at home to support her and their daughter @entity17			2
’ while @entity0 has been stood down on compassionate grounds , the management have ruled @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 out of their disintegrating plans on fitness grounds , even though the first two are set to make comebacks this weekend			1
ruled out : @entity1 hooker @entity0 ( centre ) will miss this summer 's tour to @entity4 boost : @entity3 coach @entity10 is sweating over several player injuries ‘ @entity21 and @entity0 have worked really hard to come back before the end of the season but they will not have played enough rugby to be considered , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ it ’s the same with @entity23			2
’ the removal of @entity0 , along with the serious knee injury suffered by @entity40 ’s @entity39 and @entity42 ’s recent lay - off from @entity44 duties , has created a significant problem at hooker			1
the country ’s first - choice no 2 , @entity49 , has been recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in march			0
@entity51 are still uncertain whether their captain will return to action this weekend or next			0
and if the @entity54 reach the @entity56 final , @entity49 will not be available for @entity3 ’s first test against the @entity58 in @entity59 on june 7			1
that game is increasingly likely to feature a team decimated by the loss of several key players , due to the fixture congestion which means it is taking place seven days after the showpiece culmination of the domestic season			0
needs more time : @entity69 flanker @entity22 will also miss out on @entity3 's summer tour @entity10 will be forced to field a savagely weakened line - up , including a fifth or sixth - choice hooker			1
@entity73 of @entity74 may find himself pitched into a test debut against the world champions in the hostile surroundings of @entity78			1
the 28 - year - old spent three years at @entity80 in the @entity81 , but he is now poised for an international call			2
another contender would be @entity84 ’s highly - rated rookie , @entity83			0
@entity3 are preparing to be without @entity85 for the @entity59 match , after he went off with a damaged ankle last weekend			0
but the 25 - year - old may still be selected in the hope that he can be fit for the later tests in @entity91 and @entity92			0
@entity93 is another problem , with any two of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 destined to be involved in the @entity56 final			0
other concerns are tighthead prop – where @entity101 is the only properly established figure – and fly half			0
with @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 all potential finalists on may 31 , @entity104 could play against the @entity109 at @entity110 the following day , before joining the senior tour			2
thumbs up : @entity104 has been tipped for a place on @entity3 's tour to @entity4			1

@entity1 hooker @entity0 to miss @entity3 's tour to @entity4
@entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 also ruled out
