by @entity0 last updated at 11:54 pm on 31st january 2012 @entity5 is likely to launch terrorists attacks on @entity2 soil if the isolated @entity4 regime feels threatened , @entity2 intelligence officials believe			1
citing last year 's thwarted @entity5 plot to kill the @entity14 ambassador in the @entity2 , ' some @entity5 officials â€” probably including supreme leader @entity11 ... are now more willing to conduct an attack in the @entity2 in response to real or perceived @entity2 actions that threaten the regime , ' director of national intelligence @entity8 told the @entity18 tuesday			1
officials also asserted that @entity5 has the means to build a nuclear weapon but has not yet decided to follow through , in contrast to @entity23 's insistence that time is running out to stop @entity5 from developing such a weapon			1
threat : @entity8 told @entity27 tuesday that he thought @entity5 could launch terrorist attacks against the @entity2 @entity5 has the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon , @entity8 said			1
but he , cia director @entity31 and others reasserted their stance that @entity5 is not building nuclear weapons , in subtle contrast to @entity23 officials ' statements that @entity5 could have nuclear capability within a year			2
' there is dissension and debate in the political hierarchy of @entity5 ' over whether to build a weapon , @entity8 said			2
' there is not unanimity about this ' as @entity5 political officials weigh the regional prestige they believe they may gain by possessing a weapon against the cost of further international sanctions and the risk of retaliatory military action by @entity23 or the @entity54			2
@entity31 said the latest round of sanctions against the regime is beginning to bite , with a run on @entity5 banks in recent weeks , but he conceded that the ' clock is ticking ' as @entity5 moves ahead enriching uranium to a grade that 's below weapons - ready , but higher than normal for regular industrial use			0
defense secretary @entity65 said in an interview aired this week that the @entity5 could build a bomb quickly			2
tensions high : the @entity69 was one of several @entity2 warships that traveled the @entity71 during a standoff with @entity5 ' if they decided to do it , it would probably take them about a year to be able to produce a bomb and then possibly another one to two years in order to put it on a deliverable vehicle of some sort in order to deliver that weapon , ' @entity65 said sunday on @entity83 ' ' 60 minutes ' program			1
@entity23 defense minister @entity85 said last week that @entity5 is proceeding toward nuclear weapons capability and time is ' urgently running out			0
' @entity31 said he met with the head of @entity23 's intelligence agency , @entity89 , last week to discuss @entity23 's concerns			0
while he said @entity23 sees the threat of an @entity5 nuclear weapon as ' an existential threat to their country , ' he did not say whether @entity23 agreed with the @entity2 assessment that @entity5 had not yet decided to make a nuclear weapon			1
@entity18 chairwoman @entity98 called 2012 ' a critical year for convincing or preventing @entity5 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
' the threat of @entity5 lashing out as it ponders building nuclear arms is one of a potent mosaic of interconnected enemies facing the @entity2 , including terrorists , criminals and foreign powers who may try to strike via nuclear weapons or cyberspace , @entity8 and the others said			1
@entity111 continues to be a major threat , though it is far weaker since @entity115 's death at the hands of @entity117 in @entity118 last year			0
@entity31 pointed out that ' four of the top 20 in a single week were captured or killed ' last year , leaving the leadership struggling to replace itself			0
@entity8 said the group likely will have to resort to ' smaller , simpler attacks ' as its ranks are thinned by continued pressure from @entity2 drone strikes and special operations raids			2
the intelligence chiefs predicted @entity111 's regional affiliates , such as @entity129 's @entity128 , will try to pick up the slack for the beleaguered core group in @entity118			0
the @entity2 continues to put pressure on the @entity129 offshoot , and on monday mounted airstrikes targeting @entity111 leaders there , killing at least four suspected militants , according to @entity129 and military officials			0
just below @entity5 and @entity111 on the list of threats comes the possibility of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , from chemical and biological to nuclear and radiological			0
the intelligence community does not believe states that possess them have supplied them to terror groups , but that remains a risk , @entity8 said .			0

director of national @entity8 told @entity154 leaders are considering attacks against the @entity2
@entity8 says @entity5 is one year from a nuclear bomb , if they decide to build one
however , some @entity5 *factions* are against making a nuclear weapon
