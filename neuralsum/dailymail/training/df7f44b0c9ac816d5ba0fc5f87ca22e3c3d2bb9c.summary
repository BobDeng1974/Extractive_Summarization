three cheers for @entity1 ... the only manager who sees festive fixtures like a fan whoever grants christmas wishes is really on the ball this year			0
it was december 20 , following defeat by @entity9 , when @entity10 again voiced his desire to return to media work , so he could properly let loose on the failings of referees			2
just nine days after blaming the officials for losing 3 - 0 to a team with no striker , @entity10 is gone			1
@entity19 chairman @entity18 heard one excuse too many , considered the direction of the club after a fall into the bottom three and @entity10 became the @entity24 ’s first managerial casualty of the season			1
he can now rail against referees to his heart ’s content — although whether @entity30 want an expert with @entity10 ’s record telling @entity33 where he ’s going wrong is another matter			2
@entity10 was sacked as @entity19 manager after a @entity38 defeat by @entity39 @entity18 ( left , pictured with @entity40 at @entity41 on sunday ) is now looking for a replacement @entity10 ’s statistics as a manager in the @entity24 or the old first division read played 118 , won 27			1
he has taken 110 points from a possible 354 , at an average of 0.93 per game			1
that is a history of relegation form — an aggregate of 35.3 points a season			1
@entity57 sacked him for fear of getting relegated , @entity55 and @entity56 stayed loyal and went down			0
@entity19 are not prepared to wait around to find out			2
perhaps the final straw came with @entity10 ’s comments after the @entity38 defeat at home to @entity39			2
‘ i thought they had a lot of luck last year , ’ he said of @entity19			1
‘ i do n’t see us having the same luck this year			0
’ @entity10 claimed that @entity69 ' ( pictured ) @entity19 were afforded a lot of luck last season in reality , @entity19 had defensive organisation to gather them points , rather than a sprinkling of fairy dust @entity18 said he slept on it before making the decision to jettison @entity10 , and it may have been that comment swirling around in his head			1
luck ? if it was just about luck , it would n’t matter who the manager was			0
if all @entity19 had to do was wait for fortune to intervene then they would n’t need a manager at all			2
@entity69 got lucky , poor old @entity10 did n’t			1
it is as if the two were interchangeable , as if all managers are without talent and merely blown by the wind			0
and @entity10 would like this to be true , because then his aggregate of 0.93 points per game would be a random event , and in no way his responsibility			1
it would be like those other times — @entity106 and @entity107 ’s weakened @entity105 team , and another round of faceless , incompetent officials , who always seem to gang up on him at this level			0
‘ quite a lot of luck went with them last year , ’ @entity10 added			1
‘ we must be due some now			0
’ @entity10 has an average of 0.93 points per game in the @entity24 - it is a history of relegation form @entity69 and @entity119 speak at a press conference announcing the former 's appointment on august 25 , 2013 of course , if @entity10 wants to believe his failures are in the hands of fate , that is his delusion — but to deny what @entity69 achieved at @entity19 last season is plain wrong			1
he took over a club joint bottom with seven points from 12 games and propelled them to 11th in the table			2
yes , there were occasions when matches were won on the break or against the run of play , but that was more down to defensive organisation than a sprinkling of fairy dust			1
the fact is @entity19 averaged 0.58 points per game when @entity69 arrived and 1.46 points during his reign			1
at that rate , had he been in charge for the season , the club would have finished ninth			0
the incredible comeback to help deprive @entity105 of the league title stands out , but before that @entity19 went on a five - game winning run , defeating @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			1
@entity69 ’s defence was n’t constructed by accident , either			2
under him , @entity19 were tight			2
he lost 10 league games , but five by single - goal margins , and four by two - goal deficits to @entity9 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
@entity19 finished 12th in the @entity24 last season , their highlight a 3 - 3 draw against @entity105 @entity178 ( right ) slots the ball past @entity180 to level the scores at 3 - 3 on may 5 , 2014 only @entity182 gave @entity183 ’s @entity19 what might be termed a hiding — 3 - 0 on december 21			1
@entity69 ruled himself out of a return on saturday , which is a pity as he is exactly what @entity19 need right now			1
his great strength is that he does not care what people think of him , or his football teams			0
he is unapologetic , unconcerned by his reviews			0
if nobody likes him , he does n’t care			0
@entity10 likes to give that impression , but it is n’t true			2
nobody who makes that many excuses has a thick skin			0
@entity10 does n’t like criticism			0
that ’s why it is always the referee ’s fault			0
that ’s why it is all random , a matter of luck			0
he did not do a particularly rotten job at @entity19			0
they had lost two games before he took over — including one to a last - minute @entity215 goal away at @entity172 — and managed to secure wins at @entity162 and at home to @entity105			0
@entity18 slept on his decision to sack @entity10 , but woke up in the morning convinced he needed better @entity219 ( left ) has been a shining light this season , but is set to leave for the @entity222 captain @entity223 ( left ) is also a @entity19 stalwart , but is leaving to represent @entity224 in the @entity225 they were not adrift like @entity227 and only one win short of 15th place on the day he was sacked			1
yet the squad had improved from @entity69 ’s time but in defence , @entity19 looked increasingly poor			1
they had won a single game against teams in the bottom eight , and two vital players , @entity223 and @entity219 , will be missing for the best part of january , on international duty for @entity224 and @entity240 at the @entity225 and the @entity222			0
@entity10 was staking his hopes on the january transfer window , but @entity19 did not wish to spend extravagantly to survive			1
so @entity18 turned the bedside light out , and awoke convinced he needed more			0
he will be painted as a trigger - happy chairman , the first to crack — and nobody would say @entity19 ’s path since the end of last season has been stable — but to judge @entity119 too harshly would be a mistake			1
perhaps , by sacking @entity10 , he was merely trying to make his own luck .			2

@entity10 claimed @entity19 had a lot of luck with @entity69 last season
@entity18 sacked @entity10 after the @entity19 won one game in 12
@entity10 has a @entity24 average of 0.93 points per game - it is a history of relegation form at 35.3 points a season
@entity19 averaged 1.46 points a game with @entity69 , and their *success* was more down to defensive organisation than a sprinkling of fairy dust
