by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 13:42 est , 14 november 2012 enigma variations : this coding machine sold for £ 85,000 at auction			2
for years it frustrated @entity6 intelligence with its fiendishly clever enciphering a @entity8 enigma coding machine has sold for more than £ 85,000			2
the rare device went under the hammer today and estimates expected it to sell for £ 40,000 to £ 60,000			0
however , a lively bidding session at @entity13 in @entity14 saw it fetch an impressive £ 85,250			0
auction officials said there was a lot of interest with a large number of online and phone buyers joining those bidding in the auction room			0
a keen buyer from the @entity24 made the final bid and secured the historic machine			1
built by @entity30 and @entity31 in 1941 , the oak - encased machine , which encrypted @entity8 codes during the @entity29 , is the three - rotor version , used between 1938 and 1944			2
patented by @entity34 at the end of the @entity36 , the device was intended for commercial purposes but by 1939 the majority of @entity40 machines had been appropriated for @entity8 military use			1
the @entity40 was the most advanced machine of it 's kind and analysts have argued it paved the way for modern computer systems			1
code - named @entity48 , its employees eventually broke the @entity40 codes , with the help of @entity51 colossus : the first electronic computer was designed and built by @entity54 , a post office engineer using a complicated system of rotors , the machine would encode messages before sending them via @entity60 to another machine			1
however , its downfall was the construction of the world ’s first top secret computing machine , @entity51 , at @entity48 near @entity67			2
at its peak the team at @entity69 , who included @entity70 , regarded by many as a mathematical genius , were cracking 6,000 encrypted @entity8 @entity40 messages every day			1
@entity70 played a key role at @entity48 during @entity29 , where he worked as a codebreaker			0
@entity77 is a rebuild of the original ' supercomputer ' that helped @entity70 and others break @entity81 codes during the war messages scrambled by the enigma machine were eventually decoded in under 24 hours			1
the fact that the @entity6 managed to crack @entity40 is credited with shortening the war by two years			1
there were many battles taking place during @entity90 and @entity29 - apart from the military and propaganda wars , there was also a race to crack the enemies ' coded messages			0
@entity48 , near @entity67 , was the site of secret @entity6 code - breaking activities during @entity29 it was code - named @entity48 it was the modern - day equivalent of @entity100 in @entity101 and the government recruited thousands of people from a variety of backgrounds to take on the might of @entity108 's intelligence machine			1
a @entity8 warship firing artillery during the @entity111 @entity112 referred to @entity69 as the goose that laid the golden eggs because it produced a daily stream of intelligence that helped guide his decision making			0
one particular success of intelligence was when @entity6 forces received information through decoding that vast numbers of naval @entity8 craft were assembling			0
during the following @entity111 some 8,648 @entity6 and @entity8 sailors lost their lives on 31 may and 1 june 1916			0
@entity69 's biggest breakthrough came with the building of @entity51 , the first electronic computer that helped @entity6 scientists crack @entity8 @entity40 codes			1
there were many talented people at @entity69 , including @entity54 , a post office engineer who designed and constructed @entity51 , but perhaps the most celebrated is @entity70			0
@entity70 was a mathematical genius whose work was key in breaking the @entity40 codes			2
@entity70 committed suicide at the age of 41 , with some blaming persecution because he was homosexual .			0

a keen buyer from the @entity24 secured the historic machine
the @entity40 was the most advanced machine of it 's kind
using a system of rotors , it sent encoded messages via @entity60
