by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor @entity3 will not ' align ' with @entity5 dictator @entity4 to defeat the growing threat posed by @entity8 fighters , the foreign secretary @entity2 insisted today			1
mr @entity2 said @entity3 may have a ' common enemy ' with the @entity5 regime but added : ' that does n't make us friends			1
it does n't make us able to trust them , it does n't enable use to work with them			0
' his remarks came after @entity21 , the former chief of the general staff , said it was impossible to fight @entity8 terrorists in @entity24 while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering @entity5			1
the peer said @entity3 would eventually have to work with president @entity4 to defeat the insurgency by getting his approval for a bombing campaign in @entity5			1
the row came after the @entity32 president @entity31 appeared to blame @entity3 for the rise of @entity8 – also known as @entity34 or @entity34			1
in august last year , the prime minister was humiliated when @entity47 and @entity49 rebels defeated the government , ruling out military action against @entity4			1
the @entity32 president said : ‘ if , two years ago , we had acted to ensure a transition , we would n’t have had @entity8			0
if , one year ago , the major powers had reacted to the use of chemical weapons , we would n’t have had this terrible choice between a dictator and a terrorist group			1
’ former @entity3 military chief @entity61 rejected president @entity31 ’s claim – arguing that @entity40 had been right to reject military action against @entity5			1
he said : ‘ it ’s clearly turned out over the past two or three years to be a very diverse , very complicated country – and i think the reason why quite rightly the @entity3 @entity40 voted against intervention a year ago and we did n’t join @entity70 airstrikes is that we could n’t be certain who we would be supporting			1
’ @entity5 president @entity4 , speaking in the country 's parliament in @entity74 , is fighting @entity8 terrorists in @entity5 but also moderate citizens calling for his overthrow a @entity5 man mourns over a dead body after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by @entity4 's forces in @entity83 , @entity74 , in august last year			1
@entity32 president @entity31 has attacked @entity3 for blocking airstrikes against @entity5 forces in the wake of the chemical attack a former @entity50 advisor on anti-terror laws has called on the government to reintroduce tougher police powers to track extremists			1
@entity94 , former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the government , said the decision to scrap @entity99 ’s control order system in favour of more limited terrorism prevention and investigation measures should be revisited			2
@entity94 said : ‘ i do think the government could make a legislative response to the current problem by reintroducing control orders , or beefed - up @entity107 , as they are called , to ensure that people who are identified by solid intelligence as presenting this kind of risk can be placed under controls which can prevent them activating their ideas			2
‘ i think that we can demonstrate that , certainly in the last six or seven years of control orders , they were very effective , including a provision that allowed certain people - if a judge agreed , a very senior judge - to be relocated			0
‘ of course , there are no @entity107 at all at the moment			0
the @entity107 that were created ran out and the government decided to have no more , for reasons which i have never understood			0
’ the remarks are a blow to the home secretary @entity129 , who has insisted the public are not in any more danger as a result of watering down the previous @entity50 ’s anti-terror legislation			0
it came as it emerged today that an independent watchdog called for stricter controls on terror suspects months ago			0
@entity138 , the independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation , said changes to the government 's @entity141 and @entity143 which replaced @entity99 control order regime , to make them more effective			0
but he added : ‘ what do we do about @entity4 ? ' i think whether it ’s above the counter or below the counter a conversation has to held with him because if there is going to be any question of air strikes over @entity5 airspace it has to be with the @entity4 regime ’s approval			2
’ lord @entity61 said : ‘ the old saying my enemy ’s enemy is my friend has begun to have some resonance with our relationship with @entity166 and i think it ’s going to have to have some resonance with our relationship with @entity4			2
’ but mr @entity2 rejected the former @entity172 chief ’s proposal			1
he said : ' @entity173 i heard talking about the adage that “ my enemy ’s enemy is my friend ”			0
i ’ve said very often that one of the first things you learn in the @entity179 is that “ my enemy ’s enemy is not necessarily my friend ”			0
he added : ‘ we may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy , but that does n’t make us friends with someone			0
it does n’t make us able to trust them , it does n’t enable us to work with them			0
‘ it would poison what we are trying to achieve in separating moderate @entity193 opinion from the poisonous ideology of [ @entity195 ] if we were to align ourselves with president @entity4			2
’ the foreign secretary also said that he does not believe the president has the authority to reject military intervention from other countries			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t know where the idea comes from that @entity4 has to assent to a military intervention in his country , there ’s a civil war raging in his country			2
’ mr @entity2 also rejected that @entity3 would be providing lethal support to the @entity5 moderate opposition			1
defeating the islamic state terror network will require the @entity70 and its allies to take on the terror group in @entity5 , @entity70 ’s top - ranking military official said last night			2
@entity214 , chairman of the @entity215 , said that the group could not ultimately be beaten without @entity5 featuring in @entity70 ’s broader strategy alongside the airstrikes @entity219 is currently carrying out in @entity24			1
general @entity220 said : ‘ this is an organisation that has an apocalyptic , end of days strategic , vision that will eventually have to be defeated			0
‘ can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organisation that resides in @entity5 ? the answer is no. ‘ they will have to be addressed on both sides of what is at this point a non-existent border			0
that will come when we have a coalition that takes on the task of defeating @entity34 over time			0
’ the comments , delivered in a joint briefing with @entity241 , the @entity70 defence secretary , came as @entity219 continued its assault campaign against the militant group in @entity24 , targeting areas close to the beleaguered @entity246 dam , according to the @entity247			1
@entity248 was humiliated after @entity99 joined forces with @entity49 rebels to vote down military strikes against @entity5 mr @entity241 , for his part , refused to rule out the prospect of @entity70 airstrikes in @entity5 , saying that the administration was ‘ exploring all options ’			1
he insisted that the @entity8 posed one of the biggest terror threats the world had yet seen , warning that defeating the group would be a long - term mission			0
‘ they are beyond just a terror group			0
this is beyond anything we ’ve ever seen , ’ said mr @entity241 , noting that the organisation was extremely well funded and ‘ sophisticated ’			0
@entity214 added that immediate threat stemmed from the risk of jihadists from @entity270 returning to their home nations with plans of attack on their own soil			0
‘ they can go home at any point , ’ he said			0
the @entity8 insurgency in northern @entity24 and @entity5 is , it seems , leading to a significant redrawing of political allegiances across the @entity179 – at least temporarily			2
calls for political engagement with the @entity284 regime of @entity5 president @entity4 as well as the theocrats of @entity166 have made them unlikely potential bedfellows of the @entity70 and its @entity270 allies			1
just 12 months ago , @entity289 lawmakers were seriously debating launching air strikes against @entity172 positions in an effort to halt its resistance to rebels who sought to overthrow the dictatorship			0
now those very rebels ' @entity5 strongholds are all but in the sights of the @entity300 's drones and bombers , while a senior @entity3 parliamentarian has identified @entity4 as the enemy 's enemy who is now our friend			1
@entity166 too was facing the threat of military action to halt the nuclear programme which @entity309 , in particular , feared was working towards an atomic weapons programme			1
but with the @entity70 saying it may deploy limited ' boots on the ground ' to defend @entity70 interests in @entity315 there is the bizarre prospect of @entity317 standing shoulder to shoulder with @entity166 @entity319 already stationed in @entity24			1
meanwhile , @entity309 's recent air and ground offensive in the @entity322 , ostensibly against @entity324 militants but effectively hitting thousands of @entity326 civilians , has seen the jewish state 's international standing plummet			0
and there are questions about how far @entity8 's power and influence is down to the help of wealthy individuals in @entity335 , the oil - rich @entity70 ally			2
the kingdom is well - known for espousing a fanatic form of @entity193 known as @entity339 , whose adherents , like the @entity8 's militants , are violently opposed to the beliefs of @entity344 in @entity24 and elsewhere .			2

lord @entity21 said @entity3 and @entity70 will have to open *negotiations* with @entity4
ex chief of the general staff says @entity349 can not solve ' half a problem ' in @entity24
but foreign secretary @entity2 today rejected the proposal
comes as @entity31 attacks @entity40 's decision to block airstrikes
in august last year @entity47 ruled out military action against @entity4
@entity31 said this left the @entity349 with ' choice between dictator and terrorists '
