@entity1 mislead customers over how quickly it would fulfil orders for the new @entity4 , the @entity0 said @entity1 mislead customers over how quickly it would fulfil orders for the new @entity4 , the @entity7 has today ruled			1
information on the company ’s website seemed to suggest that all orders placed before 4pm on the day before launch would be delivered next day , but that was not the case , the watchdog said			1
the claims were made on website www.o2.co.uk , in the answer to a frequently asked question about the release of the phone			2
it said : ' when will my @entity4 pre-order be delivered ? ' if we get your pre-order before 4pm the day before launch , we ’ll get it to you on launch day			1
' the only exception to this will be those customers with an address in the @entity35			0
' six complainants , five of whom had ordered the phone and not received it on launch day , challenged whether the claim was misleading			2
@entity43 @entity42 , trading as @entity1 , explained there were different types of orders for the launch			2
consumers could make a special order prior to launch which would be dispatched to arrive on launch day and this was named a pre-order			0
once their initial stock was fully allocated to customers who had pre-ordered , they stopped accepting these and accepted orders that would be met from future supplies , which were known as standard orders			0
the company said it should have been made clear to customers buying before launch whether they had made a pre-order or a standard order , and those making a standard order should have been informed that the product could take up to three weeks to be dispatched			1
@entity1 said 100 per cent of pre-orders were dispatched as planned for launch day			0
information on the company ¿ s website seemed to suggest that all orders placed before 4pm on the day before launch would be delivered next day , but that was not the case the company said that in hindsight it appeared some people making standard orders while the frequently asked question was online may have been confused by it , believing it applied to their order			1
six complainants , five of whom had ordered the @entity4 and not received it on launch day , challenged whether the claim was misleading the @entity0 said it did not consider that the claim in the frequently asked questions made the distinction between the two types of order clear to readers , who would infer that all orders placed before 4pm the day before launch would be delivered on launch day			1
' although @entity1 had explained that they had advised customers , when purchasing , which type of order they had placed , we did not consider that was sufficient to remove the misleading impression conveyed by the claim , ' the @entity0 said			0
' notwithstanding that , five of the six complainants had ordered the @entity4 from @entity1 believing that they would receive it on launch day and had not done so			0
' because the claim implied that all @entity4 5 orders placed before 4pm on the day before launch would be delivered on launch day , and because we understood that was not the case , we concluded that the claim was misleading			1
' an @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' we accept the @entity0 ’s ruling and apologise to those customers who were led to believe they would get an @entity4 the next day as a result			0
' we can confirm that the claim will not appear again in its current form and we will ensure that our ads make clear the distinction between ‘ pre-orders ’ and ‘ @entity119 ’ in future			0

@entity7 ruled the company had not been clear
the claims were made on o2 website
