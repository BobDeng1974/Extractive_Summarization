there 's no escaping the @entity2 selfie trend , so is n't it about time you perfected your photo face ? since model @entity6 first coined the term ' smizing ' a bevvy of popular poses have been infiltrating our social networking sites , including ' pruning ' , ' teeging ' and most recently the ' squinch ' by photographer @entity14			1
but how do you decide which one to choose ? fear not , one intrepid beauty writer is here to help			1
@entity17 from style site @entity19 has road - tested the ( supposedly ) most flattering poses to see which ones really work ...			1
what 's involved ? lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid to come down slightly			1
verdict ? ' perhaps i did n’t get it quite right because i think i look like i ’ve had seven and a half @entity27 too many			2
' i teamed it with a grin here , which probably does n’t help the drunken look , but without a smile it would no doubt look more serious and therefore more cool			2
' beauty journalist @entity17 of @entity32 has tested out the most popular picture poses including squinching ( l ) and smizing ( r ) what 's involved ? smiling with your eyes in the style of @entity6 on @entity39			1
verdict ? ' it ’s actually pretty hard to smile with your eyes			2
whilst also trying not to smile with your mouth			2
i felt like i was trying to freeze myself with a peculiar look on my face as if playing @entity46 ’s footsteps			2
i ’ve realised that @entity6 ’s heavy layer of smoky eye make - up gets her half way to the smize			1
' what 's involved ? copying the @entity54 sisters to project a sultry almost serious look with your mouth			1
verdict ? : ' this felt like the most posey of the lot and least like what i ’d naturally do with my expression if a camera was thrust in my face			2
to me , it looks like i ’ve had a dodgy filler / collagen job done around my mouth			0
or have really bad mouth ulcers			0
' but on those @entity69 , it looks utterly fabulous			0
as poses go , it ’s far better than the 90s pout ( see @entity73 ) and thoroughly easy to do on demand			1
' @entity17 attempts to give the @entity75 a run for her money with her pruning pose ( l ) and teegs like @entity80 ( r ) what 's involved ? bear your front teeth and press your tongue closely behind them with it slightly on show ( this is @entity80 's favourite pose )			1
verdict ? ' though @entity80 nails this look every time , i do n’t think my version looks anywhere near as good			0
it reminds me of my 3 year old niece who has a distinct lisp and whose tongue seems to permanently hang out of her mouth like a @entity99 puppy			0
i think i ’ll leave this one to @entity80			0
' what 's involved ? let loose , giggle , chuckle , @entity102 and then freeze			1
verdict : ' this felt natural and easy and although it was completely phoney , i think i fooled the camera well			0
it felt the most normal of them all			0
i thought back to saturday night when my best friend slipped across the dance floor ( ending up in a near - splits stance ) , let out a loud belly laugh and hey presto , there it is			1
' loling : this pose involves laughing out loud and freezing before the flash goes off @entity115 claims the squinch is the act of squinting your eyes in such a way as to ooze confidence and self - assuredness			1
he believes that this will make you look far more attractive than staring wide - eyed into the camera , which portrays fear and uncertainty			1
firstly , @entity14 emphasises that squinching is n’t the same as squinting and while the difference may be minor , it is vital			0
when you squint , your top and bottom eyelids close , which , @entity14 believes makes you look far from confident			0
does it really work ? @entity115 thinks that ' squinching ' ( r ) makes you look more photogenic when you ‘ squinch , ’ however , you ’re lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid to come down slightly			0
he says : ' if you 're a photographer out there , make your people squinch			0
and if you 're a human being who just wants to look hot , this is going to do it for you			0
' want to know why ? because confidence comes from the eyes			0
