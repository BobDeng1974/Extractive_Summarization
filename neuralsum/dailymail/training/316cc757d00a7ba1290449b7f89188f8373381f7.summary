by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor first minister @entity2 said @entity3 would not be stopped from sharing the pound with the rest of the @entity6 if it voted for independence a majority of @entity10 voters think an independent @entity3 should not be allowed to use the pound , according to a new poll			1
some 53 per cent of those questioned disagreed with the idea of @entity3 continuing to use the pound if it left the @entity6			1
this is more than double the number who said an independent @entity18 should be allowed to use sterling			0
some 15 per cent said they neither agreed nor disagreed and nine per cent did not know			0
it comes as the key issue of what currency an independent @entity3 would use comes under scrutiny in the run - up to the independence referendum on september 18			1
but a @entity3 government adviser said the decision on what currency @entity3 should use if it became independent was not up to @entity30			1
@entity31 , chair of the @entity33 's @entity32 which considered the issue , said : ‘ a currency is not something which can only ever be used by a single country and one country can not prevent another from using it			2
‘ indeed the choice of currency is determined by the laws of a country itself and , more importantly , the confidence people have in it			0
‘ people can choose to trade in whichever currency they wish			0
what is up for debate and negotiation is the form of governance for the currency			0
‘ and , in this regard , i remain firmly of the view that a well - designed monetary union is the best option for both @entity3 and the @entity6 post-independence			1
’ @entity62 , the @entity63 and the @entity64 have all ruled out entering into a currency union with an independent @entity3			1
@entity67 @entity66 said : ‘ a currency union would not happen if we left the @entity6			1
‘ that 's why we need to know @entity2 's plan b for what would replace the pound			2
would we rush to adopt the euro ? or would we set up a separate unproven currency ? but @entity3 ’s deputy first minister @entity76 said a separate poll showed 71 per cent of people in @entity3 agreed that the ‘ pound belongs to @entity3 as much as it belongs to the rest of the @entity6 ’			1
ms @entity76 said that research , which was commissioned by @entity18 , ‘ shows that the no campaign is increasingly out of touch with @entity3 opinion on the pound ’			1
she added : ‘ the people of @entity3 overwhelmingly believe , by a margin of nearly four to one , that the pound would belong to an independent @entity3 every bit as much as the rest of the @entity6			2
and they are right , because the pound is @entity3 's currency too			1
’ more than half of @entity10 voters do not want an independent @entity3 to be allowed to share the pound @entity3 will have to pay extra to watch @entity96 and radio shows if they vote for independence , a former director - general of @entity99 has warned			1
@entity100 attacked as ‘ make - believe ’ @entity2 ’s claim that the @entity96 would provide all its programmes for free in return for the shows produced by the first minister ’s proposed new @entity105			0
instead he said the @entity96 would be under an obligation to licence fee payers in the remainder of the @entity6 to get the best possible price for its shows when they were sold to a separate @entity3			1
he said the @entity105 would only have a programming budget around a tenth the size of the @entity96 ’s and would have to tailor its schedule to its ‘ modest means ’			0
this would mean it would have to decide which @entity96 programmes it could afford to buy			0
the net result would be @entity3 viewers having to pay to watch or listen to @entity96 programmes not purchased by their new state broadcaster , he said			2
the @entity124 meanwhile has defended a memo sent to staff telling them they had to support the @entity129 in its objective to maintain the union			0
the message , written by the @entity124 's top civil servant @entity133 , was criticised for being ‘ ill judged ’ amid concerns it could be seen as telling staff in @entity3 how to vote in next month 's independence referendum			1
but the @entity124 insisted the memo was simply intended to set out for staff the restrictions of the purdah period in the run - up to the september 18 ballot			0
the @entity96 reported the email said : ‘ it is important that , as civil servants , we understand why the @entity3 independence referendum is different from elections such as a @entity6 general election or a @entity152 election			2
‘ this is because the @entity129 has a clear position to maintain the union and so it is legitimate and necessary for @entity6 civil servants to support the government in this objective			2
’ @entity159 , general secretary of senior civil servants ' union the @entity160 , said the memo was ‘ ill judged ’ and added : ‘ it is factually accurate but it probably could have been written a lot more sensitively			0
’ a @entity124 spokesman said : ‘ of course the department has not told its staff , or anyone else , how to vote			0
‘ it was an open letter to all @entity124 staff setting out @entity3 referendum guidance and the role of the civil service			0
similar advice has been issued by the @entity33			0
