@entity0 became an instant @entity2 hero when he scored their winning goal deep into stoppage time at @entity6 on saturday			1
the new boy settled the spicy opening day derby when he sprinted forward from right - back to collect a pass from @entity11 , round goalkeeper @entity12 and roll the ball into the unguarded net			2
but who is the man who stole the headlines in such dramatic circumstances at @entity19 ? video : scroll down to watch @entity0 in action during his @entity22 days debut goal : @entity0 slots home the winning goal on his @entity2 debut let 's celebrate : @entity0 ( 15 ) is mobbed by @entity2 team - mates including @entity11 ( 18 ) what a start : @entity0 is the opening day hero as he celebrates with @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) name : @entity0 age : 20 position : centre - back where does he come from ? @entity0 , to give him his full name , was born in @entity39 but his parents moved to @entity41 aged 10 when his mother , who works in the mass catering industry , was offered a job at the 2004 @entity45			1
soon after arriving from @entity47 , @entity0 's footballing ability was noted by his @entity49 teacher @entity48 and he was referred to scouts at @entity22			1
in an interview with @entity52 last year , @entity0 explained : ' my pe teacher used to scout for @entity22 and , when i was nine , he recommended me for a trial			1
' from there , i just went up through the age groups and was always kept on while others were dropping out			0
what a moment : @entity0 is congratulated by @entity11 as they head for the @entity2 following with the ball in the net ' i suppose it was only when they offered me a contract at 14 and i enrolled in the academy school that i realised it might be quite serious			1
' @entity0 soon found the @entity22 academy a home - away - from - home and when his parents returned to the @entity69 in 2010 , he stayed out in @entity41			1
in a @entity71 interview that year , a 16 - year - old @entity0 said : ' i love the training , the @entity74 people , the @entity74 culture			1
everything about this place i like			0
' he duly signed professional form with @entity22 in april 2010 , with the @entity74 club seeing off interest from @entity82 , @entity2 and @entity83 , the team @entity0 supported as a boy			1
dominant : @entity2 might not have been at their best at @entity19 but @entity0 made his presence felt what happened next ? in january 2011 , @entity0 joined @entity87 on a loan that was initially meant to last until the end of june			1
@entity22 said at the time the loan was ' an opportunity for the athlete to grow in a more competitive and demanding environment			1
' in the end , this short - term loan lasted some 18 months as he became a regular in @entity87 's youth and reserve sides			1
the move came at just the right time , as @entity0 later admitted : ' i had become a bit spoiled or complacent at @entity22 and i needed a kick up the backside , which is what @entity87 gave me			1
' it was quite tough going to an unfamiliar place where i did n't know anyone at first			0
' coaches like @entity111 were quite hard on me but that helped a lot			0
it was the best thing that could have happened			0
it really hardened me up physically and mentally			0
the football was much faster , physical and more direct than here			0
' @entity117 : @entity0 keeps the ball from @entity119 - now of @entity120 - while on @entity22 duty return to @entity41 sporting - the academy that produced the likes of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 - were never going to let a talent like @entity0 stay away for too long and , with designs on fast - tracking him to their first team , he returned to @entity41 in august 2012			1
@entity0 was placed in the b team squad for that campaign , playing in the second - tier @entity133			2
his debut came as a substitute for @entity136 in a 3 - 1 win at @entity138 on august 26 and his first goal came against rivals @entity140 a couple of months later			2
it was certainly a moment he 'll never forget , as he explained to @entity52 : ' i was determined to take my chance when it came along			0
the @entity140 match was an amazing experience - flares were going off everywhere and you can tell the fans do n't like each other			0
' it went by in a blur			0
one thing i 've found in the first team is the intensity of concentration required is much greater and that was very tiring at first , but i 'm getting used to it			0
' sorting things out : @entity0 established himself as a central midfielder when he first broke through in @entity160 promotion to the first team a week later and @entity0 was handed his first team debut in a home win over @entity164 and a further fortnight after that , he scored his first and only senior goal for the club against @entity169			2
he went on to establish himself in the side , regularly playing as a central midfielder , before a fractured rib curtailed his first season in the first team			0
@entity0 was in and out of the team the following season , usually slotting in at centre - back or in a defensive midfield role			1
in all , he played 32 senior games for @entity22 , scoring once			2
happy : @entity0 spoke of his delight at moving to @entity2 after signing his five - year deal on august 2 this year london calling @entity0 signed a five - year contract with @entity2 on august 2 this year , with a £ 4m fee agreed			1
upon moving to north @entity183 , @entity0 said : ' i 'm really excited to be joining such a big club			2
' i 'm really happy to be here			0
i want to impress the manager and keep the fans happy , i just want to do as well as we can with the club			0
' @entity2 are a massive club			2
i 've always enjoyed their attacking football and i think coming from @entity41 that suits me - this season i want to adapt really quickly to the @entity193 and have as good a season as we can			2
' his winning goal at @entity19 has certainly set them on their way to that			0
into the groove : despite being born on these shores , the @entity6 game was his first in the @entity193 what about international honours ? @entity0 , who speaks @entity74 as fluently as @entity207 , had been asked to consider playing for @entity41 but @entity209 rules prevented him doing this until he turned 18			1
it allowed @entity47 to seize the opportunity when he signed for @entity87 back in 2011 and @entity0 made his debut for the @entity47 in an under 18 match with @entity215 in november that year			1
he quickly established himself as a regular at @entity218 level the following season and committed to the country of his birth			0
international quality : @entity0 has been a regular in a number of @entity47 youth side and could now step up despite being a year younger than most of his squad mates , he played a full part as @entity47 reached the semi-finals of the 2012 @entity45 in @entity228			1
that performance ensured a place at the 2013 under 20 @entity231 and @entity0 was duly named in @entity233 's @entity231 squad			0
he made his first appearance for the under 21 team on august 13 , 2013 in a 6 - 0 thrashing of @entity237 at @entity238 in @entity239			0
what are his strengths ? the first thing you notice is that @entity0 is far more than a standard centre - half			1
while this is his preferred position , he can also operate at right - back and in defensive midfield			0
this versatility is matched by good aerial ability ( @entity0 is 6ft 2in ) , reading of the play , strength and tackling			0
impressing in training : @entity0 nicks the ball away from @entity255 while on international duty he must have some sporting pedigree ? yes he does			0
@entity0 is the great nephew of @entity258 , who played in the 1947 fa cup final for @entity260			2
his granddad is @entity262 , a former secretary of the @entity263 between 1973 and 1989 and also an ex-president of @entity39			0
his father @entity265 is a former professional tennis player who appeared at @entity266 in the 1980s			0
how far can he go ? @entity0 has made the perfect start to his @entity2 career and can look forward to more appearances in the season to come			1
with @entity2 chasing trophies on a number of fronts , depth in their squad is essential and the 20 - year - old has already shown he can cut it in the @entity193			1
manager @entity278 proved at @entity279 that he is willing to put faith in youth and @entity0 will be at the centre of his plans			2
he will continue to play for @entity47 's @entity284 in their @entity286 campaign and , if his good form can be sustained , may well get a call - up into @entity290 's senior squad			2
scenes : the young centre back wheels away to celebrate his goal at @entity19 that won the game			1

@entity0 made a £ *4million* move to @entity2 from @entity22 this *summer*
he has played in @entity41 since having a trial at the club at the age of nine
@entity0 spent time on loan at @entity87 - almost 18 months - earlier in his career
he played for @entity47 under - 21s as recently as last year
the strong centre back is fluent in @entity74 as well as @entity207
