@entity0 , which has its @entity3 headquarters in @entity4 , @entity5 , has pleaded guilty to 23 charges of failing to notify the @entity7 about a potential deadly risk from its cookers white goods manufacturer @entity0 has been fined more than £ 75,000 after admitting it failed to reveal to authorities for four years that thousands of its cookers were potentially unsafe and could cause deadly carbon monoxide poisoning			1
the @entity18 firm , which is one of the world 's biggest kitchen appliance manufacturers , was aware from 2009 that 23 different models of its cookers produced the deadly gas from its grill if used in very particular circumstances			1
the domestic appliance giant , which has its @entity3 headquarters in @entity4 , @entity5 , knew of a risk which can occur when some of its cookers are converted for use with @entity32 gas but did n't inform @entity33 until august last year following an @entity35 investigation			0
@entity36 , @entity0 's quality manager for the @entity3 and @entity37 , yesterday pleaded guilty to 23 counts of failing to notify @entity7 about the fault on behalf of the company at @entity41			1
on behalf of @entity0 , mr @entity36 admitted that the company failed in its obligation to notify the authority about the potential risk to the cookers , after concerns arose that they were not ' safe products ' if used with bottled gas and with the door closed			1
the manufacturer 's instructions warn customers not to keep the door shut when using the grill oven but the company failed to inform the @entity7 of the risk when using the lpg kit - which converts the appliance from using natural gas to liquid petroleum			0
the company had faced a total of 69 charges brought by the council but the remainder were dropped following the guilty pleas			1
under safety regulations , the company is required to tell the local authority of problems involving its products as soon as they are discovered			0
prosecutor @entity73 said : ' when they are aware they should notify them forthwith that their products are unsafe			1
' once it was decided for it [ the cooker models ] to be converted into @entity32 it posed a substantial risk if the grill door was kept in the shut position when it was on , because there was a substantial risk of a build up of carbon monoxide			1
there 's a substantial risk of injury and death			0
' of the company 's failures , mr @entity73 added : ' it went on , not for weeks or months , but years from february 2009 to july 2013			0
' @entity0 , in february 2009 , realised there was a problem with some of their cookers and as @entity0 's hq is in @entity4 , @entity97 takes a role as its " @entity104 "			2
' if there is an issue or problem it should notify @entity33 so it can notify all other authorities			2
' the local authority ca n't do its job properly if it 's not notified by the company			0
' they had been aware that the 23 models posed a risk and we say a substantial risk because of carbon monoxide			2
' @entity119 , defending , said the company admitted that there had been a ' genuine oversight ' to notify the authority			0
he said the company had contacted owners of the affected conversion kits but had only failed to notify the council because of the oversight			2
@entity0 was fined £ 77,660 and ordered to pay £ 11,000 in costs after admitting the failings			1
following the hearing , the company confirmed 23 models of cooker – all made before 2009 – were found to be potentially dangerous when converted for use with bottled gas and used with the door closed			1
@entity36 , @entity0 's quality manager for the @entity3 and @entity37 , pleaded guilty to 23 counts of failing to notify the @entity7 about the potential risk on behalf of the company at @entity41 ( pictured ) of the 2,320 converter kits provided to households by @entity0 , more than half have been traced and the owners informed of the dangers by the kitchen appliance giant			1
however , a total of 836 remain unaccounted for			0
a company spokesman said : ' @entity0 acknowledges it should have notified @entity151 about the @entity32 conversion kits issue as soon it was aware of the matter			2
' it accepts responsibility for not doing so			0
finding these lpg kits was @entity0 's priority at the time and its efforts are continuing through a wide range of activities			2
' it is important to record that the charges relate solely to @entity0 's communications with @entity151 around the @entity32 kit issue , not its extensive activities to trace the kits			1
' these @entity32 kits are designed to convert specific models of pre- 2009 @entity0 - manufactured mains gas cookers to run on bottled gas			1
' we are only looking for a limited number of @entity32 kits in relation to this issue			0
none of @entity0 's current range of cookers is affected			0
' @entity181 , cabinet member for community safety at @entity33 , said he was pleased the court had taken a ' serious view ' of the matter			0
he said : ' i am deeply disappointed that it has proven necessary for us to initiate court proceedings in this case			0
' the fact that this prosecution has been successful is gratifying and the level of penalty imposed , plus the fact that costs have been awarded , is an indication that the court has taken a serious view of this matter			0
