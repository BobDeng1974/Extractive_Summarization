by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here to see the final leaderboard from @entity4 @entity5 has joined the pantheon of golfing greats by winning his first @entity9 title – and his third in total – at the age of 25 following a thrilling final round at @entity14			1
in the history of the game only @entity17 and @entity18 – the two greatest players of them all - had won three majors by that tender age , but that is the exalted company @entity5 is now keeping			1
@entity5 had to hold off a charge from @entity23 to lift the @entity24 for the first time , and is now three quarters of the way to a career grand slam in majors , having already won the @entity9 and @entity31			1
@entity5 began the day with a huge six - shot advantage over @entity48 but the orange - clad @entity49 was not able to challenge his playing partner			1
instead the man who came closest to hunting @entity5 down was @entity23 , who imploded here dressed in yellow eight years ago when @entity18 won and then told friends he had just ‘ bludgeoned @entity71 ’			1
but , despite @entity23 ’s brilliant round of 66 , @entity5 closed out a two - shot victory with a closing 71 and a winning total of 271 strokes - 17 under par. if @entity5 was feeling any nerves as he stood on the first tee those were immediately settled when he crunched a bullet drive down the first fairway before draining a putt from 15 feet for an opening birdie and stretched his lead to seven strokes			1
grandstand : fans watch on as @entity18 putts on the fifth on course : @entity5 should complete a career @entity40 within two to three years @entity90 out : @entity5 in the rough sandstorm : @entity48 plays out of a bunker on the 6th focus : @entity18 catches a ball as he lines one up during the final round old head : five - time open champion @entity99 carded a 68 on the final round but @entity23 also birdied the first , and two more followed at the third and fifth holes as the @entity103 overtook @entity48 as @entity5 ’s nearest challenger			1
@entity5 dropped two shots in successive holes at the fifth and sixth , but still led by four heading into the back nine after picking one back at the short ninth			1
the @entity103 , however , made his big move by eagling the long 10th hole and by the 13th @entity5 ’s lead was just two strokes			1
but once @entity112 left a bunker shot in the sand at the 15th victory was all but assured			2
@entity14 stood to acclaim @entity5 as he walked down the 18th fairway			1
they knew they were witnessing the latest step on @entity5 ’s path to golfing immortality			1
spectated : @entity18 watches his approach shot with a group of fans on the seventh grassy knoll : @entity127 tries to get one out of a bunker fallen : last year 's champion @entity130 of @entity49 surrendered his title way out : woods and girlfriend @entity133 make their way out ' it feels incredible , ' @entity5 told the @entity136			1
' today was n't easy			0
there were a lot of guys making runs at me and i just needed to stay focused , keep in the present and concentrate on what i was doing out there			0
' to be three legs towards the career grand slam at the age of 25 is a pretty good achievement			2
it 's not going to sink in for a while			0
" asked if he always felt in control , @entity5 added : ' the lead never got less than two			1
i always felt i had that little bit of a cushion			0
' i knew i had some holes where i could make birdie and 16 was the real hole for me which i think settled the championship			2
' speaking about the bet struck by his father and three friends , he added : ' i do n't think it matters so much to my dad anymore but the team - mates he did it with , i think they 're a little happier			0
hopefully the bet still stands			0
i 'm not quite sure but if it does then that 'd be great			0
' in a hole : @entity171 of @entity172 plays from a bunker on the 18th @entity174 : @entity47 's @entity23 on the fairway onto the green : @entity177 chipping to the hole on the first @entity179 : fans dressed in @entity182 attire watch @entity5 eyed up : @entity5 trying to maintain a six - shot lead going into the final day making way : @entity186 's @entity185 heads up the fairway on the 18th there was some good - natured booing at the presentation ceremony when @entity5 thanked the fans for their support , even though he is a @entity193 fan			1
the former world number one also praised the efforts of @entity48 and @entity23 , adding : ' well done for putting up such a fight			1
' @entity48 , no doubt with the way your major record is this year your time will come , and @entity23 too ...			1
