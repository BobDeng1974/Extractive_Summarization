nine - year - old @entity1 has glycogen storage disease , which means her body ca n't convert the food she eats into energy			1
there is no treatment for the condition so the youngster has to gulp down cold milk mixed with five spoonfuls of cornflour before bed to stop her falling into a coma			1
the cornflour contains starch , which acts as a slow release of energy during the night			1
her mother @entity22 , 35 , who has spent almost Â£ 2,000 on milk since the treatment began three years ago , said : ' we have to make sure she always drinks it because some nights she does n't want to			1

we get through so much in this house			0
' ' @entity1 was diagnosed aged two after she collapsed at her home in @entity38 and her neighbour had to resuscitate her			2
doctors at @entity41 noticed her blood levels dropped dangerously low , leading them to believe she had the rare disorder , which affects just one in three million people			0

as she gets older and needs more energy , this will have to increase			0
mrs @entity22 said : ' she loves milk and she 's got used to the cornflour now			2
it 's normal to her			0
she just does n't like it when it gets to the bottom and it 's all powdery			0

they say she gets away with everything			0
' i try to keep everything as normal as possible , but @entity1 still gets embarrassed about her condition			1
' when she went on her first overnight school trip i had to have a word with her teachers because she did n't want to drink the milk with cornflower in front of her friends			1
' now she 's older she understands it better and knows she needs to drink it to keep her alive			0
she 's less embarrassed and will go to sleep overs and on school trips			0
her friends all call it @entity1 's special milk			1
' at the moment we have to do blood checks so that we know @entity1 's energy level is safe , but i 'm hoping that one day she 'll know herself when she needs to get her energy up and eat more accordingly			1
' glycogen storage disease is where the body can not convert food eaten into energy			1
glucose is a major source of energy for the body			2
it is stored in the form of glycogen in both the liver and muscles and later released with the help of enzymes			0
people affected by the disorder have an inherited defect in one of the enzymes responsible for forming or releasing glycogen as it is needed by the body during exercise and / or between meals .			2

@entity1 , 9 , has glycogen storage disease , which means her body ca n't convert the food she eats into energy
no treatment for the condition so youngster has to drink milk mixed with cornflour to stop her falling into a coma
