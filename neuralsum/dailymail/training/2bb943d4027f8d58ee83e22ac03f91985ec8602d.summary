by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 14 march 2012 ' abhorrent ' : @entity1 lived with his father 's corpse for nearly five months while claiming £ 2,000 of his benefit payments a man left his father 's dead body in bed for nearly five months so he could claim his benefit payments - even telling his innocent 10 - year - old daughter that her grandfather was just asleep			1
@entity1 was jailed for three years after police found the body of his father @entity13 , 54 , on a bed in the living room of his home in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the macabre discovery was made after neighbours raised concerns when they did not see the elder mr @entity1 for five months			1
@entity22 had been living at the house alongside the body but kept quiet about his father 's death as he pocketed nearly £ 2,000			1
the 29 - year - old , now of @entity29 , @entity30 , admitted preventing a lawful and decent burial of a dead body between october 31 , 2010 and march 22 last year			2
he also pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to theft after collecting £ 1,869 of his father 's income support payments from the post office			1
sentencing him at @entity40 , recorder judge @entity39 said : ' such offending is abhorrent to all decent - minded people who will be disgusted by your behaviour			2
' it was callous and offensive to his [ @entity47 's ] friends and family who no doubt have been caused considerable distress by these circumstances			2
' it also seems to me that you were motivated in part by greed			2
' @entity1 falsely told police he had spoken to his father since november 2010 and had had a drink with him at @entity59			1
concerns : police found the body of @entity47 , 54 , on a bed in the living room of his home in @entity17 , @entity18 an inquest last february was told mr @entity1 had a long history of poor health , including heart attacks and strokes , and had been in ‘ extremely emaciated ’ with a protruding rib cage and long fingernails			1
he had lived in the house for 26 years but his health had deteriorated due to heavy drinking and smoking and he was largely confined to his bed after returning from a spell in hospital			2
distressing : @entity1 even lied to his 10 - year - old daughter and told her her grandfather was asleep his dead body was found last march after neighbours became concerned for his welfare , having not seen him since the previous october			1
the neighbours contacted @entity85 , and police then visited the house , where they found mr @entity1 ’s partially mummified body on a bed in the front room			1
a post mortem examination revealed he had died of coronary artery atheroma , with no evidence his death could have been suspicious			0
a verdict of death by natural causes was recorded			0
judge @entity39 told @entity22 : ' you pretended he was still alive , misleading others - particularly your own daughter , a little girl			1
' you have shown little remorse for your offending			0
' a decent person would have immediately admitted to the police that this poor man had died months before but you tried to pretend he had been dead for only days			1
' det insp @entity106 of @entity107 said : ' this is an unusual case and it is the first of its type that we have dealt with in @entity18			0
' it was a challenging crime and one that most members of the community will have found appalling and i am pleased that @entity22 has now been punished for what he did			0
' one neighbour said : ' i had always got on with @entity13 , he was a nice bloke , but i had not seen him for ages			0
i kept asking his son if he was ok , and he would say " yes "			0
' we thought his son was looking after him , i was constantly saying " is your dad alright ? " and obviously he was not			2
it is not nice , it has upset me			0
' another neighbour said : ' @entity13 was a friendly chap who would do anything for anybody			0
' “ it has made me so upset , you do not leave an animal like that			0
when you think it is your dad , it is even worse			0
i would like to remember him before he got ill having a laugh and a joke , not dying the way he did			0

@entity1 claimed £ 2,000 while living with the emaciated corpse
told police he had had a drink with his father at @entity59
