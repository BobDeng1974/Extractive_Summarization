in @entity1 , @entity2 , it all begins with a euphoric voice over a crackling radio : ' hey , hey , hey ! ' the signal from an @entity7 whaling captain in a tiny boat on the grey waters of the @entity10 is heard in nearly every home of this frozen town as far north as you can go in the @entity14 , and its meaning is clearly understood			1
a bowhead whale - one of the oldest and largest mammals on earth - has been caught			0
the marine mammal , which can reach sixty feet in length and weigh more than 100 tons , required a herculean effort to move			0
@entity22 continued into the night to butcher it into manageable portions			0
warning : graphic images fresh catch : in this october 7 photo , @entity27 , center , helps cut up a bowhead whale caught by @entity7 subsistence hunters on a field near @entity1 , @entity2 keeping with a tradition that stretches back thousands of years , bowhead whales are hunted by boat during the fall season			1
once ashore , residents flock to help in the work of divvying up the whale			0
as children slide down the whale 's slippery side , officials inspect the catch and ensure the hunters have followed international guidelines to keep traditional whaling on a subsistence scale for native communities			0
the skin and blubber , known as muktuk , is prized by the @entity7 , and often eaten frozen			2
the community says the catch helps them feed their families in the town where produce such as watermelons that are flown in cost as much as $ 20 each at the local grocery			1
animal encounter : children play on to the whale 's head before work begins to butcher it whale of a time : whaling is a community event in @entity1 , as family members and town residents race to the beach to congratulate the hunters and help to butcher the catch ( above @entity74 , right , and daughter @entity75 take a picture ) bloody : a cutter stands on top of the whale - the meat , baleen , bones and organs are used for food , art , household goods , and construction from ship to shore : once a whale is caught , it is pulled on land by the tiny boats , in an effort that often takes hours local celebrity : @entity96 , center , gets a hug from his wife as he is congratulated for harpooning the bowhead whale - the crews that bring in a whale are celebrated in town grub 's up : the whale skin and blubber , known as muktuk , is prized by the @entity7 , and often eaten frozen team effort : family members and friends of the @entity112 whaling crew celebrate the capture of the sea creature way of life : @entity96 , second from left , walks his son along the giant mouth of the bowhead whale he harpooned - the skills for the hunt are learned first by watching , and then by doing , as the tradition is passed forward giving thanks : @entity125 , above center , leads a prayer flanked by his sons @entity129 , in green suspenders , @entity131 , in white bib , and @entity133 , fourth from right giant : the whales , which can reach sixty feet in length and weigh more than 100 tons , can take a herculean effort to move sliced : blades lashed to poles are used to cut down through the blubber in sections , to be hooked and hauled off enough for all : a section of the skin and blubber is reserved for the captain of the boat , who hosts a feast for the community tradition : children of @entity1 too small to help with the hooking and cutting , are brought down to the whale to learn about the process air mail : some sections of blubber are placed into duct - taped coolers and shipped by plane to elders living in warmer climates farther south keeping the energy up : as workers continue with the cutting and hooking of the whale blubber , others prepare a soup to warm the crews getting into the spirit : most members of a whaling family pitch in once a whale is caught			1
often , three generations of a whaling family are at the task of butchering and dividing the whale manual task : young whalers learn about butchering on job - they start by using a hook to pull off the giant slabs of skin and blubber - later , they may move to the more skilled task of cutter momento : whale bones are coveted by many in @entity1 , often used to adorn the grave sites of loved ones clean up time : after a whale is divided and shared , blood and some remains are hauled off farther from town			2
