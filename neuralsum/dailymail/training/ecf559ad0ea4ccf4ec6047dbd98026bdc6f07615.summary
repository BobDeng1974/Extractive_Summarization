the shimmering lead - cut crystal teardrops of a large chandelier that hangs precariously from the rotting ceiling joists offers a hint of the house ’s former grandeur			2
as do the expensive swag curtains hanging incongruously as a backdrop to a rubble - strewn floor			1
this is the @entity12 , a home once owned by the @entity15 royal family			1
its cracked walls are covered in moss patches , weeds grow through the plaster , pigeon and rat droppings litter the rotting carpets and the swimming pool is covered in green slime			2
yet this husk of a home is worth about £ 30 million , even in its ruined state			1
the reason ? it sits on tree - lined @entity31 in @entity33 — as famous for its @entity34 ’ row nickname as for its tasteless architecture — which was proclaimed last month the second most expensive road in @entity38			1
paint flakes off the walls , the ceilings have disintegrated and weeds sprout on the vast double staircase			0
a few hundred yards down the avenue is another palatial home , @entity63 , also empty			2
@entity64 and algae cover the tiles of its pool , damp seeps through its ceilings and discarded mattresses and furniture litter its rooms			0
two more homes nearby — @entity76 and @entity77 — have also met the same sorry fate			0
this prestige address reflects an extraordinary and disturbing new trend in the property boom in which multi-millionaire overseas home - owners leave houses empty and untended for years on end , until they become derelict			2
there are some 15 unoccupied and dilapidated mansions on @entity31 , worth as much as £ 350 million			1
the super-rich who own them are confident that even if they leave the properties to rot they will still get a tremendous return on their investment when they sell up , because of increasing land values			2
since they have houses all over the world , these wealthy men need not set foot in these ruins			0
and because they can afford to leave them empty , they benefit from tax concessions most of us who actually live in our homes can only dream of			2
renovation costs on houses left empty for more than two years are eligible for a reduced vat rate of just five per cent compared to the normal 20 per cent			1
in addition , if these gargantuan , wrecked properties are demolished , and a new home constructed on the site , building costs are not subject to vat			0
valuable : decaying properties like @entity52 will still recoup a huge profit tread carefully : ferns and weeds now climb its dilapidated staircase by stoking demand for such multi-million - pound properties , these potentates are pouring fuel on an already roaring housing market — which means the prospect of home - ownership further down the chain is spiralling far beyond the reach of countless families and young couples			0
why has @entity31 become a road full of deserted mansions ? and why are more and more wealthy foreigners using @entity33 ’s property market as an investment ? the @entity31 used to be owned by the @entity141 in the 19th century , and its homes were on vast , leafy and attractive plots of land a short walk from @entity147 and within easy reach of the @entity149			1
soon industrialists such as @entity151 , of @entity153 sugar fame and @entity154 , the son of the supermarket founder , as well as cinema and musical hall stars such as @entity159 moved in			0
by the 1940s the street became the butt of comedians ’ jokes because of the increasingly ostentatious homes springing up and the influx of nouveau riche inhabitants such as holiday camp king @entity167			0
in the @entity169 , the rich were building what a @entity170 of @entity172 council official noted as ‘ often unscholarly and dull or aggressively modern and incongruous ’ homes			0
with worldwide political and economic unrest in the @entity179 , oil and shipping magnates from across the world began buying up properties on the street which was by now earning a reputation as being the @entity38 equivalent of @entity183 in @entity184			1
over the decades affluent businessmen from @entity186 , the @entity187 and @entity188 all bought on the @entity31			1
the @entity189 acquired several properties			0
more recently , @entity192 oligarchs have moved in			0
former glory : the @entity52 ' imposing staircase is green with mould haunt of the super-rich : these days , the only visitors to the @entity52 are security guards meanwhile , the owners started to compete with their neighbours to build the most opulent @entity202 , a @entity204 industrialist , bought a huge 30,000 sq ft home there , named it @entity206 and installed a bath big enough for 20 people			2
inevitably , locals nicknamed it ‘ @entity212 ’			0
as the @entity31 ’s international reputation grew , land values soared			1
@entity215 , the @entity217 steel magnate and once @entity38 ’s richest man , bought the @entity219 in 1996 for £ 6.75 million and sold it in 2011 for £ 38 million — a profit of £ 2 million for every year			1
@entity76 was bought in about 2005 for £ 12 million by a @entity222 former minister			1
the property was seized in 2011 by @entity224 after a lengthy @entity226 battle , and put on the market for £ 30 million			1
@entity228 , where fashion tycoon @entity229 was shot dead in 1984 , was bought for just £ 400,000 in the @entity179 and is today estimated to be worth £ 14 million			1
ten of the homes now standing vacant were owned by @entity15 princes			1
they invested in the @entity38 property market because they feared @entity236 dictator @entity235 was about to invade their homeland and seize their vast wealth			1
these mansions were sold last year and are to be redeveloped — ‘ when ’ is open to question			2
many of the houses are purchased by offshore companies , and @entity247 documents show a paper trail leading to @entity249 , the @entity250 and the @entity251			0
this desire for anonymity has robbed @entity31 of any sense of community spirit , however			1
many owners have spent a small fortune screening their property from the road , and some years ago , a council report lamented how many of the homes were becoming ‘ intimidating ’ fortresses to keep prying eyes out			2
around a third of the houses on the exclusive row are currently standing empty given the continuing demand for homes on the street , owners are understandably confident that even if they leave the properties empty to rot they will still get a tremendous return on their investment			1
there is one snag , however			0
wildlife enthusiasts claim that the numerous nooks and crannies in these derelict properties are now inhabited by bats and owls			0
and since all species of bat and their roosts are protected by law , developers could be prevented from knocking down the dilapidated houses , as well as making extensive refurbishments			0
@entity289 , the free - market think tank , has proposed a ban on foreign buyers outside the @entity293 buying homes , claiming that in 2012 , at least 85 per cent of prime property was paid for with money from overseas			0
but @entity33 is still seen as a safe investment , with no sign of an end to ‘ land - banking ’ and tasteless development on @entity31 and surrounding cul - de - sacs			1
the council lists several of the houses — many adorned with turrets , weather vanes and curly gables — as @entity54			0
now , to add insult to injury , the properties are not only vulgar but falling down			0
and if the bats and owls have their way , they will remain derelict for a very long time to come .			0
