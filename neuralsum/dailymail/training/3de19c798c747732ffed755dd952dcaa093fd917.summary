@entity0 will spark a fresh scramble to secure his services among @entity4 clubs after a close confidante reveals that he expects his next job to be in @entity7			1
@entity0 is under contract at @entity9 until 2016 but a new book on his life at the @entity13 club reveals he is planning a short , intense career at various club and that @entity7 is his preferred next destination			1
@entity17 would be favourites to recruit @entity0 , given his friendship with @entity19 , his former @entity20 team - mate , who is now director of football at @entity17 and held that role at @entity23 when @entity24 was coach			1
a close confidante of @entity0 says the @entity9 manager expects his next job to be in @entity7 @entity27 : the @entity28 is out now but @entity0 's preference for @entity7 will put @entity31 chief executive @entity30 on alert , given the contortions @entity31 went through last season waiting for @entity34 to renew his contract			1
@entity34 , aged 65 , signed a three - year deal only at the end of the season but the need to plan for a succession was a prominent theme of last week 's @entity42 at the club			2
journalist @entity44 had year - round access to @entity0 in the authorised book of his first season at @entity9 , @entity27 , and wrote : ' @entity0 says : ' i 'm a @entity20 man and always will be			1
' this does n't mean , however , that he 'll ever be back training @entity20			0
in fact , if i were a betting man , i 'd say that his future is going to be @entity9 and then @entity7			1
' who knows ? he may end up in eight - to - ten years taking a curtain call by coaching a national team			0
he is n't planning a very long career and the family agreement seems to be just that : a limited but intense career span			0
' what he would really love to do is manage the youth programme – train young players , oversee their development , teach them the fundamentals and get everything he can out of them			0
perhaps he 'll do it one day , although it certainly wo n't happen any time soon			0
he has three years in @entity67 and , if he does n't extend his contract , possibly a stint in @entity7			2
' @entity70 would be interested in bringing @entity0 in to replace the possibly departing @entity34 @entity19 ( right ) worked closely with @entity0 at @entity20 and could also be targetting the @entity71 @entity19 came close to persuading his former colleague to joing @entity17 in 2012 whilst @entity74 owner @entity73 was desperate to appoint @entity0 , before @entity0 eventually opted for @entity9			1
another close friend , @entity76 coach @entity75 , also expects @entity0 to leave @entity9 in 2016 and come to the @entity4			1
' will @entity0 be able to keep this up for more than three years ? ' said @entity75			2
' i really doubt it			0
the guy uses up so much energy			0
he lives everything at 1000 miles an hour			0
i think the same thing will happen here as happened in @entity20			0
he 'll be exhausted after three or four years and he 'll have to take another break			0
then he 'll be off to @entity7 and more of the same			2
