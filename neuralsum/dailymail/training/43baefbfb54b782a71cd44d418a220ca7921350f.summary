@entity14 , dubbed the @entity15 , said : ' since @entity16 was seen with a swaddling blanket more people have been buying them but now they need to know how to use them properly			1
it 's more than just a blanket			2
if folded correctly it can transform a screaming baby into a calm one in three minutes			2
' cry baby solution : swaddling can soothe a distressed newborn according to dr @entity28 swaddling is one of the techniques @entity32 recommends to new mothers as she teaches the parenting practices recommended by @entity35 's dr @entity28			1
he said babies can be soothed by following what he calls the ' @entity40 's ' - swaddling , putting them in a side - on position , making shushing sounds , swinging them and giving them a dummy to suck			1
dr @entity28 's advice in based on his belief that babies aged 0 to three months are in the ' fourth trimester ' and can be best settled into the world by being in an environment similar to how they were in the womb			1
his ' the @entity55 ' advice has been widely followed in the @entity35 and now @entity32 , from @entity56 , is spreading the word in the @entity58 after becoming one of a handful of credited instructors in dr @entity28 's baby calming techniques			1
the baby calmer : @entity14 teaches dr @entity28 's ' five @entity40 's ' technique in the @entity58 a mother of three grown - up boys , @entity32 said she wishes she had known the methods sooner as it would have made her life easier when her sons were newborns			1
she said : ' it is tempting to think that someone who can calm a baby easily has a special gift but it has nothing to do with talent and everything to do with understanding why restless babies cry			2
' she said all of dr @entity28 's advise is based on ' tried and tested methods ' and ' ancient techniques ' such as swaddling			1
swaddling goes back to biblical times but has died out in recent generations in @entity58 as women no longer know how to due it - or fear causing hip displacement in their babies by doing them too tightly ( a problem @entity32 said is n't relevant if you wrap the baby so their hips still have room to move )			1
ancient technique : @entity32 shows a new mother how to correctly swaddle her baby it 's a wrap : swaddling replicates how babies felt curled up in the womb but they must n't be bound too tightly she gets her clients to first practise swaddling on dolls so they can get the technique right before wrapping their baby			1
she said a swaddled baby will sleep longer during the night and , if swaddled at certain periods during the day , will settle easier and some very restless babies will latch on with more ease if swaddled , though skin - to - skin feeding is still the ideal			2
she explained that the method works by replicating how the babies were in the womb when they were comfortably curled up			0
in the current heatwave , she said mothers need n't have their babies swaddled for long periods			0
to avoid them overheating , she said they should be swaddled without any clothes but just wearing a nappy			0
parents should always be sure to check the baby is not too hot			0

he went to a friend 's christening where all the babies were crying and upset and he calmed them by swaddling each one			2
' but @entity32 says if put down to sleep babies must always be put on their backs and the swaddled must be @entity156 should be discontinued when the baby is able to turn over in its cot			0
@entity32 added that the shushing noises are also key to a happy baby			0
she said : ' babies are not used to complete peace and quiet			0
