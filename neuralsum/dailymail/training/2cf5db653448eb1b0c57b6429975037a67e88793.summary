by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 13:37 est , 21 december 2012 a varistor , a variable resistor , believed to be similar to the one sent 15,000km to the @entity4 to try and save a £ 7m project to drill two miles under the ice it is one of the most valuable deliveries ever made to the remote @entity4 ice			1
scientists from the @entity12 today took delivery of a thumbnail sized ' varistor ' - a variable resistor believed to cost just £ 1 - that could save their £ 7m project			1
it was sent 15,000km after the original , and a spare , both failed , threatening the future of the ambitious project to drill 2 miles under the ice to look for signs of early life			1
engineers will now attempt to fit the part in the next few days in the hope of restarting drilling next week			1
the drill is powered by hot water , but was halted when the resister inside a boiler burned out			2
a spare was sent from @entity36 via @entity37 to the remote camp in @entity39			1
twelve scientists from the @entity12 have worked around the clock over the past fortnight to bore 10,000ft down to ice - locked @entity43 to collect samples of water and sediment			0
they hope to find unique microbial life forms there which have been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer			1
the team 's test drill hole			2
they now face a race against time to drill 2 miles into the ice to try and reach a frozen lake where they will look for signs of microbial life the team 's 12 scientists have been working around the clock to try and save the mission the malfunction could mean that the project , which took 16 years to plan , would have to be abandoned the team had hoped to penetrate the thick ice cap to reach the lake last week , but technical difficulties have knocked them off schedule , pitting them in a race against time to complete the mission before their equipment freezes			1
the bas team have been trying to melt their way down to @entity43 using a 2 mile - long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to @entity78 at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch			0
however , when the scientists fired up their boiler 's primary burner for the first time its controller circuit failed			2
a secondary burner was fitted and the team worked around the clock to shovel snow to feed the hot - water drill , and in four days they had melted enough to begin drilling the borehole to the cavity			1
aerial view of the site , where the the 12 scientists , from the @entity12 , are now in a race against time to complete the mission drill testing at the base , where staff now face a race against time the 12 scientists , from the @entity12 , are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt but then , on saturday afternoon , this secondary burner failed leaving the @entity12 team with nothing to do but wait for a replacement part as their bore hole - and equipment - slowly begins to freeze shut			1
' we are now committed , having gone past the point of no return , ' expedition leader @entity116 told the @entity119			0
' if anything stops working now , water could freeze in the pipes and the whole programme could come to a halt			0
' drilling preparations for the team , who admit that they only have one more chance to complete the project the drill site in situe of the @entity43 mountains			1
the £ 7million project to drill beneath two miles of @entity4 ice in search of undiscovered life hangs in the balance - after a major equipment failure			1
the @entity12 reports that the replacement components will be with the deep field team in a few days time			2
they will work with the manufacturers to make sure they install them properly			0
but if the replacement parts malfunction malfunction again the team will have no option other than to by pass the circuitry and manually ' drive ' the burner - an operation that will require skill and a light touch			0
the @entity43 drill site on the @entity4 ice sheet : four @entity36 scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice for queen and country : the mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent one of more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in @entity39 , @entity43 is equivalent in size to the @entity36 's @entity173 , measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and nearly 500ft deep			1
completely cut off from any light from the @entity175 , any life lurking beneath its waters must endure complete darkness , intense pressure and subzero temperatures			1
it is only geothermal heat from the @entity184 's core and the intense pressure exerted by the weight of the ice above that has kept it liquid			1
should any organisms be found living in its icy depths , they could offer tantalising clues as to how life might look elsewhere in the solar system , such as in the ice - covered oceans of @entity199 's @entity198			2
expedition leader @entity116 confirmed they were past the point of no return and feared the water would re-freeze in the pipes and borehole , halting the programme			0
a plane unloading fuel at the site staff at the site working on the project 's test drill holes the bas team planned first to bore down to 1,000ft , then stop to create a cavity , then drill a second borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way down to the lake			1
the cavity is what controls the pressure of the liquid being drawn from @entity43 , stopping a geyser of prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and spilling out over the surface of the ice			0
once they reach the waters , they will have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense uv light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before the hole refreezes again			0
technology : the @entity12 team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile - long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to @entity78 at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch @entity43 is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the @entity4 : equivalent in size to the @entity36 's @entity173 , it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and is nearly 500ft deep the location of @entity43 on the @entity4 ice sheet : it is just one of 400 subglacial lakes detected beneath the ice of the frozen southern continent @entity116 , a @entity12 engineer who is heading the programme , spoke earlier this month to the @entity258 by phone from his tent on the @entity4 ice sheet			2
' it 's bloody cold , ' he said			0
the team will spent six weeks at the site , where temperatures , according to the @entity12 , are @entity265 , with winds of 20 knots			0
for much of that time they will work around the clock			0
' @entity43 principal investigator @entity270 from the @entity271 said : ' this @entity36 mission is part of an international effort to discover and explore subglacial lake environments			2
team effort : the 12 - man team have been working around the clock to shovel snow to feed their hot - water drill - until the boiler frustratingly malfunctioned inhospitable : the team have been battling against freezing cold weather to complete their mission ambitious : intrepid engineers and scientists from the @entity12 have been trying to drill two miles to an ice - locked lake deep beneath the glaciers of the western @entity4 ' we are about to explore the unknown and i am very excited that our mission will advance our scientific understanding of @entity39 ’s hidden world			1
' right now we are working round the clock in a cold , demanding and extreme location – it ’s testing our own personal endurance , but it is entirely worth it			0
' the technical difficulties are something that are not unfamiliar in @entity39 - it 's a hostile environment and very difficult to do things smoothly			0
' the good news is that we found the fault relatively early on in our deployment system and so we have quite a lot of fuel that is left remaining			0
' if we did n't have that of course we would n't be able to continue any further			0

tiny variable resistor sent 15,000km from @entity36 as researchers race against time to complete project following drill failure
now set to be fitted and tested by engineers who hope to resume drilling next week after malfunctioning boilers have now pitted them in a race against time to complete the project before their equipment freezes
they hope to find life forms which have been shut off from the rest of the @entity184 for at least 100,000 years
