ten minutes or so into the second half of @entity4 's @entity3 game against @entity5 on tuesday night , the home team were winning 2 - 0 and progress to the next round was all but assured			1
@entity4 's captain , however , was found 20 yards inside his own half executing a sliding tackle on breaking opponent @entity11			2
this , in essence , is the new life of @entity13			2
@entity16 's captain and most reliable centre forward is no longer a striker for his own football club			1
@entity19 's team formation all but confirmed what @entity13 has known for a while and as national coach @entity22 attempts to move his own team forward he is going to have to accept it , too			1
@entity4 's @entity13 is no longer a striker at his own club as he is pushed back in midfield @entity13 sat back away from the action up front against @entity5 in his new role under @entity19 @entity13 applauds the fans at @entity31 after @entity4 ran out comfortable winners on tuesday @entity4 's average positions against @entity5 on tuesday night with @entity13 ( no 10 ) and @entity34 ( 31 ) @entity13 has always liked to tackle , has always liked to roam the field in search of the ball			1
this is different , though			0
@entity40 does not want to play @entity13 as a central striker anymore , a fact confirmed when he sent his team out with @entity34 in a position further advanced than @entity4 's third - placed record goalscorer on tuesday			1
' i think he 's a bit lost , ' was the opinion of former @entity4 forward @entity48 , now an in - house tv analyst			1
' he 's there to score goals			2
' can he play in midfield ? he can because he 's good but is it his best position ? in last six or seven games , it 's apparent that it 's where he is going to play			2
' he 's the most natural goalscorer at the club and always has been			0
his goals tell you that			0
he knows whether to bend it , place it or drive it or take a touch			0
there is an art in that and he has got it			0
' at the moment he is wasted in midfield			0
he was at the far post in front of how own goal with ten minutes to go , challenging as the @entity5 defender came in			2
@entity4 were 3 - 0 up			1
' why is he there ? is that really the best place for him ? ' @entity13 has long since been a victim of his own versatility and energy at @entity31			1
he tackles , passes and anticipates more than well enough to play in the middle of the field			0
contrary to what @entity48 said , he does not look lost there but whether that is his best position is something that can only fuel debate			0
sir @entity87 admitted six years ago that he had played @entity13 out of position too often in order to accommodate @entity90			2
he vowed to change that and never did			0
@entity92 , meanwhile , spoke earnestly about restoring @entity13 to his ' best position ' last season but by that stage @entity94 was the club 's automatic choice at ' number nine '			1
@entity13 shoots against @entity5 but the @entity16 centre forward finds it hard to push forward these days @entity13 is living a new life under @entity40 as the @entity4 manager avoids using him up front @entity13 averaged a position further back than @entity34 ( left ) and @entity105 ( right ) on tuesday night @entity13 's average position on the pitch this season there is a difference , though , between @entity13 playing in and around a central striker and being transformed in to a much deeper player , a midfield player			1
@entity13 always knew the change would come one day but – as he said in an interview last september – he did not expect it to come for a couple of years or more			0
' the manager goes into so much detail about the opposition and there 'll be times i 'll be needed to play deeper or wider , which i 've no problem doing , ' @entity13 told the @entity124			2
' but in the main i feel i 've still got at least two or three years up front			0
i know i 've the qualities to play in midfield			0
i 've done it comfortably			0
' there 'll come a time when i move to a deeper position for good and that could be this week , it could be in a couple of years			0
it 's down to the manager and i 'll accept it			0
' @entity40 has accelerated that process now			0
the @entity4 manager 's centre forwards are now @entity141 , @entity142 and young @entity143			1
it 's a decent line up , certainly , but the fact that @entity13 is no longer on the list maybe says more about the lack of quality midfield options available to @entity40 than anything else			1
what @entity22 makes of it is anybody 's guess			0
@entity40 will not concern himself with this and nor should he			0
@entity4 's supporters – notoriously ambivalent about the national team – will not lose sleep either			2
the @entity16 head coach , though , will be concerned			0
this season has seen @entity22 's options in the centre forward department expand significantly			1
@entity40 has taken over at @entity4 and given the club 's @entity164 captain an entirely new role @entity40 has moved @entity13 back although the @entity4 star still has eight goals this season @entity16 manager @entity22 has decisions to make for who to use up front next month @entity13 may partner @entity171 ( right ) up front but his new position could make @entity22 reconsider at least one happy striker on tuesday night was @entity143 , who scored as @entity4 beat @entity5 3 - 0 at @entity31			1
click here for @entity177 's match report a @entity179 season that has seen @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity183 blossom , for example , will surely be reflected in the squad when @entity16 gather for their next mind - numbing @entity187 qualifier against @entity189 next month			1
what is certain , though , is that @entity22 started this campaign with the image on an attacking partnership of @entity171 and @entity13 in mind for next summer 's finals in @entity196 and will not have expected to consider deviating very much from that in the intervening months			2
currently @entity13 has eight goals for his club this season and has scored in just one @entity4 game since the middle of december			1
@entity181 , meanwhile , has 13 , @entity180 20 and @entity183 – who did n't get going until the end of october – seven			0
these are statistics that very much reflect the direction of @entity13 's career at @entity4			1
asked about it on tuesday night , @entity40 gave little away , preferring to talk about @entity34 's height – ' he is a very long player ' – than the actual matter in hand			1
that is the @entity4 manager 's prerogative			1
he will do what he thinks is best for his club and currently he is managing to nudge his peculiar and inconsistent team vaguely along in the right direction			0
they are third in the @entity179 and now in round five of the @entity3			2
@entity13 , though , must adjust to a drastic change in his circumstances			0
had been deployed much further back on tuesday night , he would have been untangling his studs from his own goal net			1
@entity13 's stats show that he is adapting to his new life in midfield away from acting as a striker @entity13 must adjust to his new role under @entity40 and he was playing in that position against @entity5			1

@entity13 averaged a position behind @entity34 on tuesday night as @entity4 beat @entity5 at @entity31
@entity4 comfortably won 3 - 0 in their @entity3 fourth round replay
@entity13 must adapt to his new role under manager @entity19
@entity16 's most reliable centre forward is getting used more in midfield
@entity13 has eight goals this season despite being pushed further back
