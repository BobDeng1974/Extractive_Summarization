by @entity0 and @entity1 at first glance , @entity2 , a 39 - year - old mother of four , from @entity4 , does n't appear to have a care in the world			1
but appearances can be deceptive and the reality is quite different			0
although she looks healthy , this summer will be the last @entity2 and her family will ever enjoy together			1
' what 's killing me is motor neurone disease and the medication , ' she explains			1
' i 've been told i only have a year to go but i do n't believe it			2
we 'll see ! ' brave : @entity2 , 39 , is dying of motor neurone disease and plans to spend her last months with her family @entity2 was diagnosed with motor neurone disease , a degenerative condition that attacks the nervous system , on the 23rd december 2010 and told that she had just over two years to live			1
three years on , @entity2 , who appears on tonight 's @entity26 documentary , my last summer , believes she has at least one year left , which she plans to spend with her husband @entity31 and her two youngest children , @entity33 , nine , and @entity34 , six			1
' i did n't want them to think i was keeping things from them , ' reveals @entity2 , who told her family , including her two older children from a previous relationship , of the diagnosis immediately after finding out			1
' i 've never done that before so why start now ? ' while @entity34 appears to be coping with her mother 's illness , @entity33 took it badly and in a heartbreaking scene in my last summer , reveals that she wishes she had n't been told			1
' it was a shock , ' says the nine - year - old , who says that she would ' be more happier ' if she did n't know anything			2
' while @entity52 struggles to come to terms with the prospect of losing her mother , @entity2 herself has thrown herself into planning her last weeks and even her funeral			1
brave : @entity2 ( second right ) with ( from left ) @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , who also appear in the documentary ' i have made a decision , ' she reveals			1
' if i ca n't swallow , you do n't feed me , if i ca n't breathe , you wo n't make me breathe - i do n't want that stuff			2
' i do n't want to end up paralysed with a feeding tube and a breathing machine			2
you can go on for a very long time like that			0
' when it comes to when i ca n't physically speak or ca n't move , i 'll be too far gone for me to change anything about it - i 'll be stuck			2
' her funeral plans include a party led by a celebrant who will help her family relive happy memories and deliver her final goodbye from beyond the gravee			0
that , however , does n't make the prospect of leaving her family behind , the two youngest girls in particular , any easier			0
' the only thing i 'm scared of [ about dying ] is who 's going to find me and how will my children will cope			1
@entity34 and @entity33 are young			0
@entity90 is n't going to plait their hair and give them the motherly chat about periods			0
tragic : of the five to appear in my last summer , @entity2 is one of only two still alive to enjoy summer 2014 ' and my fear is , he 's going to make the wrong choice , ' she says stopping mid-sentence , her voice cracking			1
' it hurts knowing that someone else is going to have to step into my shoes to be a mother to my children - and not knowing who they are			0
' because you do n't know if they 're going to do right -- if they 're actually going to love them right			0
he 's a fantastic dad - but he 's not a mother			0
i wish i could meet them [ potential step - mother ] now			0
i 'd like to choose them , but @entity31 would have a fit ! ' @entity2 , ordinarily so composed , wells up			2
' i 'm dying ... ' she adds , her voice wobbling			0
' my body 's dying , my inside and my heart are dying - when i look at my children and when i ca n't do things with them			1
' you 've got to look it and say , " what would be the best thing ? " the best thing would be to survive it			0
but it 's not going to happen			0
it 's just going to get worse and worse			0
' @entity2 appears on my last summer , tonight at 9pm on @entity26			1
