useless : the turbine outside the @entity2 government office in @entity3 is to be scrapped after only producing £ 5 of electricity a month a wind turbine which cost the taxpayer almost £ 50,000 but generated just £ 5 of electricity a month is to be scrapped			1
installed outside an office of the @entity2 government , the turbine was part of its plan to become more environmentally friendly			1
despite the fact that civil servants were warned the 60ft turbine was being placed a location that was too sheltered and would not experience enough wind , they went ahead and paid £ 48,000 for it			1
last year it was revealed that the turbine was producing an average of just 33 kilowatts of energy a month – the equivalent of £ 5.28 worth of electricity			1
based on those figures , the turbine would need to stand for 757 years before the cost of it was offset by the electricity it produced			1
yesterday it emerged that the turbine is to be removed because the manufacturer has gone into liquidation			2
ministers said they do not have anyone else to maintain it			0
a spokesman for the @entity39 ’ @entity37 said : ‘ it beggars belief that tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ’ money was squandered on a scheme with such a minuscule return			0
’ the turbine manufacturers , @entity45 , warned civil servants that their office in @entity3 , @entity48 , was the wrong place for the turbine before it was erected in 2009			1
instead of putting it close to the coastline , they insisted on sitting it in a valley , two miles from blustery @entity55			0
turbine expert @entity56 said : ‘ it ’s very important with any wind turbine to ensure they have unobstructed access to wind from all directions			2
‘ unfortunately , the @entity2 government ’s turbine was located in a valley two miles from the sea			1
it was also located next to tall buildings , so even if there was a strong wind it was displaced by the time it reached the turbine			2
’ the wind turbine ’s performance was monitored from january 2012 until july 2013 and it was found to generate 33 kilowatts per month			1
using the current average price of electricity of 16p per kilowatt , that means it made £ 5.28 of electricity a month			2
the turbine broke down in january and the manufacturer went into administration soon after that			0
a welsh government spokesman said the turbine stopped working when the brakes were ‘ locked on ’			0
he said : ‘ our contractor was in discussion with @entity45 until march to try and resolve the fault , when they received an email [ to say ] that the company had gone into administration			0
‘ they have been unable to progress the matter with the administrator and , as such , the wind turbine has remained out of use			0
‘ as the prospects of finding a company able to take on the maintenance and repair are limited , we are considering options for its removal			0
’ not enough power : last year it was revealed that the turbine was producing an average of just 33 kilowatts of energy a month			1
based on the figures , it would have needed to stand for 757 years before cost was offset experts are divided over the efficiency of wind turbines and their capacity to generate electricity			1
lucrative subsidies – paid for by taxpayers in the form of higher energy bills – are offered to landowners who erect turbines on their property by the government , which sees building new wind farms as key to meeting tough @entity131 carbon emission targets			0
but opponents say the targets , which aim to reduce carbon dioxide by 80 per cent by 2020 , are unrealistic and wind turbines will never be an efficient source of electricity for the @entity137			0
earlier this year @entity138 in @entity139 was criticised after it emerged it spent £ 30,000 on two turbines which generated only £ 95 of electricity in 12 months .			2

structure was placed outside @entity2 government offices in @entity3
civil servants were warned the turbine would not get enough wind
last year it generated 33 kilowatts a month *-* equivalent to £ 5.28 of electricity
it would have needed to stand for 757 years before its cost was offset
turbine is being removed because manufacturers have gone into liquidation
