like millions of women across @entity2 , i will stop at virtually nothing if it promises to make me fitter faster			0
from toning footwear to vibrating dumbbells , @entity7 and aqua - aerobics , you name it , i ’ve tried it			2
and , as a busy mother - of - two , if it requires no effort on my part , so much the better			2
so , when i heard about a new , high - tech exercise regime , which simply required me to strap myself into a body suit that looks like something from @entity19 , plug in some electrodes and let science work its magic , it sounded like a dream come true			1
@entity40 was first designed as a rehabilitation aid for elite athletes — top footballers @entity43 and @entity45 are fans — but has since garnered a reputation as a quick fix for weight - loss and improved muscle tone			1
this , in turn , has led to huge demand from normal women who want to get rid of cellulite and stubborn body fat			2
it uses @entity60 ( @entity59 ) technology to provide the equivalent of an hour ’s workout in 20 minutes , giving your muscles electric shocks as you work out			1
although you ca n’t see results straight away — it takes about four sessions — @entity59 apparently stimulates 90 per cent of your body ’s main muscles every time you use it			1
@entity73 with specially trained e-fit expert @entity74 who travels the globe training people to use the system the scientists behind it claim it can help with body - shaping , weight - loss , stamina and endurance , as well as improving posture and reducing back pain			1
the system also promises to stimulate your mood and sense of wellbeing — in fact , pretty much the only thing it wo n’t do is give you a massage afterwards			2
during a single session , the device works 350 different muscles , contracting them a total of 36,000 times , meaning they ’re working up to ten times harder than during conventional exercise — ideal for busy women who do n’t have enough time in their week to spend hours pumping away in the gym			1
admittedly , it sounds oddly reminiscent of the @entity59 - style slimming belts that have been around since the @entity109 — the same belts that led thousands of couch potatoes to believe they could get a six - pack just from sitting on the sofa and which were dismissed as ‘ quackery ’ by the @entity116			2
the scientists behind it claim it can help with body - shaping , weight - loss , stamina and endurance , as well as improving posture and reducing back pain it ’s true the principles of @entity59 have been around for a while , but the technology has advanced and new research shows @entity59 can have a positive effect in conjunction with exercise			1
sadly , you still ca n’t just sit on the sofa and expect miracles			0
various studies confirm you can get serious results from this approach			0
in fact , the @entity139 recently tested developments in equipment , and revealed that muscle strength and endurance improved over time in those who had used an @entity59 device			0
so , with all this in mind , i headed to one of the six gyms in the @entity2 to offer @entity40 , and eagerly squeezed myself into the gymwear provided — a skin - tight t - shirt and three - quarter - length gym trousers , specially made from 95 per cent breathable cotton , so that nothing will stand in the way of the electrodes as they power through to your muscles			1
then , it was on with the gear that contains the technology — a bulky , high - tech jacket and unflatteringly - padded shorts — with extra straps fastened around the biceps and calves			0
i smiled at specially trained e-fit expert @entity74 as he pulled the straps tighter			1
how bad could it be ? @entity74 , who travels the globe training people to use the system , warned me that my muscles would be put through their paces , thanks to short , sharp electric shocks			1
it sounded a little extreme , but the list of benefits spurred me on , not to mention the fact i knew it would be over in 20 minutes			0
as he jabbed at the buttons on the shiny , silver keyboard attached to the suit by a series of wires , i began to feel a slight tingle through my body			1
‘ crank it up ! ’ i chirruped with a thumbs - up , thinking of all the hours of gym - time i ’d save			0
this ultra-modern system works by contracting the muscles , during which you basically clench your entire body while waiting for the pain to subside i felt brave — this was easy			1
all i could feel were jabbing , pinprick sensations all over my body			0
it was rather strange , and certainly not nice , but by no means painful or uncomfortable			0
so , at my insistence , @entity74 cranked it up			1
the scale goes from zero to 100			0
by the time it reached half capacity , i was a jibbering , juddering wreck as , every few seconds , electronic pulses seemed to sink beneath my skin , before trying to blast their way out to the surface			0
i could n’t say aloud what i was thinking — because i was too breathless to do more than gasp			0
in the @entity218 , @entity217 sports scientists used @entity59 in the training of elite athletes this ultra-modern system works by contracting the muscles , during which you basically clench your entire body while waiting for the pain to subside			1
@entity74 kept reminding me of the importance of moving — this is designed to boost your workout , not replace it , so you ca n’t just let the machine take the strain			2
he led me through a gruelling regime of bicep curls with light weights , lunges , squats , running and jogging on the spot , before fast - paced sit - ups , abdominal crunches , cycling and scissoring my legs — each of the exercises accompanied by what felt like constant , static electric shocks			0
as he cranked up the intensity , i gritted my teeth as electrodes pulsed on to my skin , triggering my nerves to contract and relax the muscles			2
at £ 50 per session , @entity40 is not much more than a regular session with a posh personal trainer , and takes up far less of your day as your body is rigid , even the simplest squat or lunge is a real effort			1
performing strengthening and toning exercises while wired up to the machine apparently intensifies the way the muscles respond , forcing them to work twice as hard in the same time			2
towards the end , i could feel my muscles were contracting involuntarily , even when @entity74 switched the machine off			1
was this normal ? i asked			0
‘ yes , ’ @entity74 reassured me			2
‘ it ’s a sign it ’s doing the job			0
’ the underlying muscle tissue is activated , too , which is what gives such a powerful sensation and makes you even more exhausted			0
by the end of the session , i collapsed , drenched in sweat , feeling as if i ’d been through an hour of circuit training , not a 20 - minute workout			1
at £ 50 per session , @entity40 is not much more than a regular session with a posh personal trainer , and takes up far less of your day			1
so , if you can endure the discomfort , this could be worth the effort			0
and if it cuts down my time in a sweaty gym , i could definitely be persuaded to return			0
