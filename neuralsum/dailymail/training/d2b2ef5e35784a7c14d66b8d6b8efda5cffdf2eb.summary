one unlucky bride literally fell head over heels on her wedding day			2
@entity3 was getting ready to make her big entrance at her wedding reception at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , on october 11 , when her new groom , @entity9 , decided to be spontaneous and pick her up in his arms as they sprinted into the tent holding all their guests			1
things were going great for the first few seconds of their entrance , but then @entity18 , 27 , dropped @entity3 to the ground , falling on top of her and causing brief panic among the guests			1
in an interview with @entity46 , @entity3 explained that the fall , which happened on a concrete walkway , looks far , far worse than it actually was			1
' both his arms went under me so really he took most of the impact			0
it looks like in the video he body slammed me but really , i really felt , like , nothing , ' she said			0
' i was kind of sore the next day but , i mean , when you fall onto the cement , of course you ’re going to be sore			0
' bouncing back : seconds after the fall the couple was back on their feet seeing the bright side : @entity3 is now happy she and her new husband had a unique wedding entrance now , the high school sweethearts from @entity69 just ca n't believe how popular they have become - and are very grateful for that unplanned entrance			1
' i was shocked but i mean , really , i think back on it and i was , like , who else can really top that kind of wedding entrance ? ' said @entity3			2
' it ’s something me and my friends and family will never ever forget			0

@entity3 and @entity9 of @entity69 , @entity8 , were making their entrance at their wedding reception when @entity18 decided to carry @entity3
while sprinting down the concrete walkway with his new bride in his arms , @entity18 *stumbled* and dropped her to the ground
while the two were a little scrapped and bloodied , they bounced right back up and continued their entrance
