foreign secretary @entity0 , speaking yesterday in the @entity1 , @entity2 , warned the @entity4 report into @entity6 's nuclear ambitions could spark a regional arms race @entity9 will launch military action to prevent @entity6 developing a nuclear weapon as soon as @entity12 , intelligence chiefs have warned			1
a report by a @entity4 watchdog into @entity6 ’s nuclear ambitions ‘ completely discredits ’ the @entity17 nation ’s protestations of innocence , according to foreign secretary @entity0			1
the @entity19 found that @entity6 is developing a nuclear test facility , nuclear detonators and computer modelling for a nuclear warhead that would fit on an existing missile			1
sources say the understanding at the top of the @entity29 government is that @entity9 will attempt to strike against the nuclear sites ‘ sooner rather than later ’ – with logistical support from the @entity32 a senior @entity34 figure has revealed that ministers have been told to expect @entity9 military action , adding : ‘ we ’re expecting something as early as @entity12 , or very early in the new year			1
’ officials believe president @entity40 would have to support the @entity9 or risk losing vital @entity42 - @entity32 support in the next presidential election			1
in recent weeks , @entity45 sources confirmed that contingency plans have been drawn up in the event that the @entity29 decided to support military action			1
but the source ruled out direct @entity29 support , adding : ‘ of course we are not in favour of @entity6 developing a bomb – but do we think they ’d use it : no. ‘ the bigger concern is it will be impossible to stop @entity56 and @entity57 from developing their own weapons			1
’ mr @entity0 said @entity29 would push for more sanctions against @entity61 when the @entity19 committee meets later this month			1
meeting the masses : @entity6 president @entity64 waves to supporters while visiting the city of @entity68 , of @entity61			1
he vowed that @entity6 will not retreat ' one iota ' from its nuclear programme all smiles : @entity64 hit out at the @entity19 , saying it is discrediting itself by siding with ' baseless ' @entity32 claims that @entity6 is seeking to develop nuclear weapons @entity6 ’s president @entity64 , meanwhile , vowed not to retreat ‘ one iota ’ from its nuclear programme			1
in a statement on @entity78 affairs , the foreign secretary was critical of @entity9 ’s ‘ occupation ’ of @entity81 land			1
but he announced @entity29 will abstain on a @entity4 vote later this week to give statehood to @entity81			1
in its latest report on @entity6 , the @entity4 @entity19 outlines the sum of its knowledge on the @entity88 's alleged secret nuclear weapons work , including : yesterday the @entity6 president gave a passionate speech to thousands of supporters in central @entity6 , and broadcast on live state television , denouncing the @entity4 report			1
he hit out at the @entity19 , saying it is discrediting itself by siding with ' baseless ' @entity32 claims that @entity6 is seeking to develop nuclear weapons			1
the @entity32 has yet to comment on the findings , but @entity96 said it is ready to push for sanctions of ' an unprecedented scale ' if @entity6 refuses to answer new questions about its nuclear programme			1
foreign minister @entity101 said that if @entity6 fails to answer concerns raised by the report , the international community should raise diplomatic pressure to a new level			1
@entity107 is n't publicly commenting yet on the @entity4 assessment in a likely sign that it will wait for @entity110 and @entity111 to signal their intentions			2
@entity115 spokesman @entity114 yesterday said that @entity116 is studying the report and repeated calls for dialogue and co-operation			2
speaking to supporters in the city of @entity68 , @entity64 said @entity6 will not stop its nuclear development , adopting a defiant position against the report , which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country			2
he said : ' if you think you can change the situation of the world through putting pressures on @entity6 , you are deadly wrong			2
the @entity6 nation will not withdraw an iota			2
' @entity6 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , not weapons production			2
@entity64 's regime is already thought to have built a top - secret explosives test facility at a site in @entity142 , just outside @entity61 , where it is conducting experiments to develop a weapon			2
scientists are building hi - tech precision detonators which would be essential for a nuclear device , and developing a uranium core for a nuclear warhead , the @entity4 said			2
spreading the word : @entity64 is adopting a defiant position against the report , which could spur efforts for new sanctions against his country nationalism : supporters of @entity64 wave flags during his speech in @entity68 the report also lays bare that @entity6 scientists are trying to mount a nuclear payload into their @entity164 missiles - which can reach @entity9 , @entity6 ’s arch foe			2
the report compiled by @entity167 is the strongest sign yet that @entity6 seeks to build a nuclear arsenal , despite @entity61 's insistence its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes			0
the document claims that while some of the suspected secret nuclear work by @entity6 can have peaceful purposes , ' others are specific to nuclear weapons			0
' a 13 - page attachment to the agency 's @entity6 report details intelligence and @entity19 research that shows @entity61 working on all aspects of research toward making a nuclear weapon , including fitting a warhead onto a missile			0
ahead of the report 's release , @entity9 defence minister @entity188 warned of a possible @entity9 military strike against @entity6 's nuclear programme			0
he told @entity193 that he did not expect any new @entity4 sanctions on @entity61 to persuade it to stop its nuclear defiance , adding : ' we continue to recommend to our friends in the world and to ourselves , not to take any option off the table			0
' the ' all options on the table ' phrase is often used by @entity9 politicians to mean a military assault			0
@entity6 is also pursuing its nuclear weapons programme at the @entity142 military base about 30 kilometres from @entity61 , diplomatic sources in @entity207 say while some of the suspected secret nuclear work outlined in the annex could also be used for peaceful purposes , ' others are specific to nuclear weapons ' , the report claims			0
some of the information contained in the annex was new - including evidence of a large metal chamber at a military site for nuclear - related explosives testing			0
the bulk , however , was a compilation and expansion of alleged work already partially revealed by the agency			0
but a senior diplomat familiar with the report said its significance lay in its comprehensiveness , thereby reflecting that @entity6 apparently had engaged in all aspects of testing that were needed to develop such a weapon			1
also significant was the agency 's decision to share most of what it knows or suspect about @entity6 's secret work with the 35 - nation @entity19 board and the @entity242 after being stonewalled by @entity61 in its attempts to probe such allegations			0
copies of the report went to board members and the council , which has imposed four sets of @entity4 sanction on @entity61 for refusing to stop activities that could be used to make a nuclear weapon and refusing to cooperate with @entity19 attempts to fully understand its nuclear program			0
inspection : @entity64 visits the @entity255 in april 2008 the nuclear power plant in @entity257 , southern @entity6 - a site that may be targeted in a mooted military strike the agency said the annex was based on more than 1,000 pages of intelligence and other information forwarded by more than 10 nations and material gathered by the @entity19 itself			0
the report suggests that @entity6 made computer models of a nuclear warhead and includes satellite imagery of a large steel container the @entity19 believes is used for nuclear arms - related high explosives tests			0
in remarks broadcast on state television , @entity64 said that @entity19 chief @entity167 was simply repeating @entity32 allegations			0
' he delivers the papers that @entity32 officials hand on him , ' @entity64 said			0
' i am sorry that a person is heading the agency who has no power by himself and violates the agency 's regulations , too			0
' he repeated @entity6 's stance that it is not involved in making a nuclear weapon : ' they should know that if we want to remove the hand of the @entity32 from the world , we do not need bombs and hardware			0
we work based on thoughts , culture and logic			0
