' ' the brass at @entity4 feels like they 've tried to do everything possible to breathe new life into this show , ' said the insider			0

when contacted by @entity82 , a show spokesperson denied any plan by @entity4 to end the show			0
the show is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of @entity91 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity8 the way they were : the show originated with @entity68 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 went on to have @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 join the panel series			0

in 2012 , following the cancellation of talk show @entity161 , @entity4 launched a test show called @entity164 , the network 's first extension of @entity98			2

they believe the success of @entity98 could carry over right into that 11am slot that @entity9 currently holds , ' another insider said			1
