they are seen in the footage rifling through bags and coat pockets of about 40 wealthy customers while one woman had her wedding ring ripped from her finger			2
one looter is seen rifling through drawers and what appears to be a till			2

it has also emerged that one rioter , @entity112 , 18 , was living in a £ 3million apartment , funded by @entity115 taxpayers			2
he and his family were housed in one of @entity119 ’s most fashionable areas after they fled @entity120 to claim asylum in @entity115 but he claimed to be so poor that he joined the riots to steal money for food			1
@entity54 : the mob also attacked the @entity96 , a casino and shops			1
a taxi and a pizza delivery driver were also attacked and police vehicles were bombarded @entity14 footage shows rioters on the rampage in this shop			0

’ the @entity157 can now reveal that @entity112 and his family trashed their six - bedroom flat in a grand @entity161 mansion block in @entity162 after being housed there by the council			1
to the fury of neighbours , who include a naval admiral , they enjoyed a 3,000 sq ft basement apartment just by @entity168			0
the property , which if rented on the private market could command around £ 6,000 a month , had been refurbished before their arrival last year			0

‘ the windows were broken , the doors were off			0
it looked like it had been party central			0

he was given a youth rehabilitation order after being convicted of wounding and possession of an offensive weapon in 2010 and robbery in june 2011			0
but like many of the gang members , he breached the order to join the riots , during which he was part of a group that ransacked an off - licence , battering the terrified shopkeeper over the head eight times with a bottle of champagne			2
yesterday judge @entity229 jailed @entity112 for six and a half years for conspiracy to commit violent disorder and robbery			2
the court heard that @entity112 was part of a mob of more than 50 youths from rival gangs who teamed up for a night of ‘ devastating ’ disorder			1
she told them : ‘ it was a year ago today that you were involved in the mob criminality that so disturbed the law - abiding members of the public			2
' today , in stark contrast to the scenes of arson , looting and damage , @entity119 is hosting the @entity252 , which demonstrates the excellence which can be achieved in sport and is an inspiration to all			1
' however , those involved in these events were intent on the opposite			0

on the subject of the lavish accommodation previously given to @entity112 and his family , councillor sir @entity299 , leader of the @entity300 , said yesterday : ‘ it is important to note that rent levels for local housing allowance are not set by councils but by the @entity308			0
‘ but we welcome the cap introduced by the @entity311 that will ensure that taxpayers no longer fund unreasonable levels of housing benefit			0
