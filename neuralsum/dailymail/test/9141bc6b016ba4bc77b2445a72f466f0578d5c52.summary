one of @entity1 ’s most respected @entity0 claimed that the @entity3 judges did not want to give 12 years a slave the @entity5 because it was not patriotic enough to @entity6			0
according to hacked @entity9 emails , @entity7 said that the voting panel objected to having a @entity12 director paint their country in a bad light			1
she said that @entity16 would not win as the @entity17 did not want such a dark message about the @entity6 to be ‘ sent around the world ’			1

@entity37 founder @entity47 said that the documents ‘ show the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation ’ and should be in the public domain			0
but @entity9 reacted with fury and a spokesman said that the company wanted to ‘ strongly condemn ’ @entity47 ’s actions			1
the email from @entity7 , who has been called the most powerful pr on the @entity58 of @entity6 , was sent to former @entity40 chair @entity59 in october 2013			1
global perception she wrote in the email : ' this film is made by a @entity63 that exposes the darkest " hidden history " of @entity6 , exposing a cruel and brutal segment of our white society			2

‘ they are all fiercely patriotic and very aware of our day by day international standing politically and culturally			0
‘ this film is made by a @entity63 that exposes the darkest " hidden history " of @entity6 , exposing a cruel and brutal segment of our white society			2
these plantation owners are as terrible as the @entity70 , who are the only " acceptable " cinematic villains			0
‘ as powerful as @entity82 is as a producer / spokesman , he will not over expose himself in the states			0
’ she added that the @entity17 ’s experience of watching the film was ‘ not pleasant ’ and that some might fast forward or turn it off because of the violence			2
she wrote : ‘ many others who have seen it tout the brilliant filmmaking but are a bit embarrassed by the story and more importantly did not " enjoy " watching it			0
‘ my point is ...			0
is this the story @entity6 cultural bell ringers want to send around the world as the " best story " in the best picture ? ’ two members of the voting panel later admitted to not watching 12 years a slave , giving some credence to the claims			2
but in another twist , by january last year @entity7 had changed her tune and organised a lunch for the film , photos of which are still on her website			1
she was also wrong about the film and 12 years a slave did win the @entity28			1
the tranche of emails were stolen last year by group calling itself @entity120 , though it later emerged that it was the work of @entity121 in response to the release of the @entity9 film : ‘ @entity125 ’ , a parody about the secretive communist nation			1
when @entity121 threatened to carry out further attacks at screenings @entity9 cancelled the opening but changed its mind after pressure from the @entity132			1

but by then the damage to @entity9 ’s reputation was already done			1
among the new revelations is that there will be a @entity1 movie of @entity151 - but not for a few years			0
an email sent in january last year from @entity153 , president of @entity154 for @entity9 , to the company ’s chief executive @entity155 explains the plans			1
@entity153 writes that she has spoken to @entity159 , the director of @entity160 and that negotiations are underway			2
the email says : ‘ he said that while there has been tremendous interest ( and pressure from @entity166 ) ( @entity167 ) to do a dr who film , the show runners feel very clear that they do n’t want to do one at this moment			2
‘ that said , over the course of the coming months , the show running team is coming up with an 8 year timeline for the brand – laying out all that will happen with it			0
‘ he says that a film will certainly be a part of that timeline			2
‘ so the answer is that a film wo n’t happen in the next year to 18 months , but it is expected that it will happen after that within the 8 year horizon			2
’ @entity188 has already been fired by @entity9 and is due to formally leave the company next month to set up her own production company			1
she has apologised over the affair and in a statement said that the emails were ‘ insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who i am ’			2
