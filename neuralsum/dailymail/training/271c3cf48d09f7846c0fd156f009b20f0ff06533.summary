by @entity1 reporter for more than half a century , it has been cinemagoers ' favourite treat			0
now there may be another good reason - apart from the flavour - to scoff popcorn at the movies			1
researchers found film fans are much less likely to be influenced by irritating screen advertisements if they are munching popcorn at the time rather than sucking a sweet			1
researchers found film fans are much less likely to be influenced by irritating screen advertisements if they are munching popcorn at the time rather than sucking a sweet in tests , popcorn eaters spent less on advertised brands than those who sucked on a cube of sugar instead			1
psychologists think the reason may be due to the complex way our brains react to adverts designed to reinforce brand awareness			0
evidence suggests consumers subconsciously mouth or pronounce brand names that are repeated while their eyes are fixed on the screen			1
sucking a sweet allows this to happen uninterrupted			1
but grazing on popcorn , which involves picking up and chewing the snack , interrupts this sequence			1
in other words , scientists say , it 's not simply a distraction from what 's being broadcast on the screen but actually interferes with the whole familiarisation process			2
popcorn was introduced to @entity48 just before the @entity49 when dispensing machines were launched in cinemas by the @entity53 firm @entity52			1
then with the growth in prosperity during the 1950s , cinema visits increased and it soon became available in shops			0
sales have grown in recent years and the @entity48 market is reported to be worth more than £ 40million a year , partly thanks to a boom in home cinema and giant tv sales			1
as a result , traditional plain , salty and sweet flavours now compete with newer ranges such as toffee , raspberry , chocolate brownie and even sweet jalapeno			2
it 's nearly 80 years since psychologists first discovered that when someone is repeatedly exposed to a word or name , they subconsciously pronounce it			0
it has since become a key tool in advertising strategies			0

scientists at the @entity92 in @entity93 recruited nearly 200 psychology students and got them to watch a series of short films			0
some of them were given popcorn to snack on , others chewing gum and a third group a cube of sugar to suck			2
in between the films , they were exposed to a number of ads for products ranging from body lotions and fizzy drinks to crisps and charities			2
a week later , all the recruits were invited to another experiment during which they were given cash and told to buy what they wanted from a counter selling a variety of products - including those they had seen advertised			0
the results , published in the @entity123 , showed the sugar cube group were much more likely to opt for the brands they had seen advertised at the cinema , while the popcorn - munchers were more inclined to choose cheaper less well - known alternatives			2
chewing gum during the adverts had the same effect as popcorn , researchers found			0
in a report on their findings they said : ' oral interference due to eating popcorn or chewing gum while watching commercials reduced advertising 's effects			1
' @entity144 - based psychologist @entity143 said the results fit with previous studies suggesting chewing or talking can also reduce the affect of stress on the mind			0
it has been shown that when people worry they have an internal dialogue that keeps them focused on the problem and that if you keep the mouth busy it 's more difficult for them to do that			0
