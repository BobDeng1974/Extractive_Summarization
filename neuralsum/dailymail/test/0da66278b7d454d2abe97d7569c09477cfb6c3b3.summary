no other scoreline could have emphasised how seriously this new @entity2 team are taking their prospects of winning major trophies again			1
' one - nil to the @entity2 ' used to be commonplace before @entity5 arrived and made everything more exciting , and you sensed the class of 2015 quite enjoyed travelling north and nicking the narrowest of victories at @entity12 with a first - half goal from @entity14			1
it was @entity2 's eighth win in a row , their best run since the @entity20 team in 2004 , and kept the pressure on @entity22 , who they meet in their next league game at the @entity26			1
only once before this season have @entity2 won 1 - 0 but striker @entity28 feels the hard - fought victory proved there is more to this current @entity5 team than pass - pass - pass and dissolve when the going gets tough			1
in other words , they are built to last			0
@entity28 wants @entity2 to continue their @entity36 winning streak and challenge for the title ' you ca n't play your best football every game			1
we tried to be focused on not conceding and it 's one more clean sheet , ' @entity28 said proudly			1
' as long as we were winning the game i do n't think we were in too much danger			2
' if we had been told we would win this game 1 - 0 i would have signed for it straight away			1
@entity12 played really tough against us			1
it was a big fight			0
' we know about the record of the @entity48			0
it 's really good for us to be near that and i 'm really proud to take part			2
but we do n't want to stop here			0
we want to carry on and keep this good run going until the end			0
' @entity14 's 12th - minute strike was enough for @entity2 to earn a 1 - 0 victory over @entity12 on saturday the win was @entity2 's eighth in a row and they kept up the pressure on @entity36 leaders @entity22 if @entity2 manage that , @entity61 might have a far tighter finish to the title race than he could have anticipated a couple of months ago			1
@entity5 has even found his own @entity66 in 23 - year - old @entity68 @entity67 who sat in front of the back - four and kept @entity12 's chances to a minimum on saturday			1
club legend @entity72 even gave him a new nickname ' the detective ' for the way he sensed danger and snuffed it out			0
' i always knew i could do a job for the team			0
i just needed a chance to show it , ' said @entity67 , who was sent loan to @entity82 earlier this season			0
it 's ironic that having preached the beautiful game for nearly two decades @entity5 has finally found a couple of warriors in @entity88 and @entity67 that hark back to the @entity90 era			2
@entity5 's side face @entity22 in their next home game and have an @entity93 semi-final to look forward to even if they ca n't catch @entity22 this time they will fancy a proper tilt at the @entity36 next season and by then they might be back - to - back @entity93 winners			1
they won the trophy last may and face @entity102 in another semi-final at @entity104 on saturday			2
' we have a better balance in the team , ' @entity5 said			0
' @entity67 contributes to that , @entity108 has come into the team and big players like @entity88 , @entity28 and ( @entity113 ) @entity112 were out for four months in the season			2
' i also have a quality bench and quality players like @entity120 and @entity121 who did n't travel			0
we have a big squad and i think we have quality			0
' @entity67 was praised for his performance in midfield with @entity72 calling him ' the detective ' 360 - days since @entity2 's last 1 - 0 away win in the @entity36			1
that was in march 2014 against @entity129 when @entity130 scored the winner			0
the @entity2 manager is playing down chances of overtaking @entity22 : ' we have to be perfect ' â€“ but the @entity26 will still be buzzing in a fortnight when the top two clash			1
for @entity12 , it will be matches against @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 in the next five weeks that determine their @entity36 survival prospects rather than this result			1
striker @entity145 , who was twice denied an equaliser by goalkeeper @entity147 , said : ' if we could have got something against @entity2 it would have been a bonus			2
but we get cracking again next weekend against @entity150			0
' the return of @entity152 as a late substitute was also a boost for the @entity12			2
@entity152 has missed eight months with an achilles injury but his experience will be extremely valuable in the run - in .			0

@entity2 beat @entity12 1 - 0 at @entity159 on saturday
win was @entity2 's eighth in a row in the @entity36
@entity28 wants @entity2 to maintain charge and challenge @entity22
@entity2 play @entity22 in their next league game at the @entity26
