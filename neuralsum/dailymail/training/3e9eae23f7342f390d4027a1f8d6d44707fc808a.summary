by @entity0 ditch the helmets for flat caps and switch bright jackets for a grey cardigans to blend in with the locals and avoid scaring the sheep - this is a @entity9 man 's video advice to the @entity11 riders when the grand race begins in july			1
@entity14 's tongue - in - cheek video for those joining @entity16 hopes @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 for the opening three stages of @entity11 in @entity16 has gone viral with its broad - ranging advice extending to pies and peas , livestock , the weather and the best - suited footwear for traversing wet roads - it 's clogs , by the way			1
the video saw 10,000 hits in its first few hours of posting on @entity33 and has soared over 60,000 views , attracting attention from around the world			2
' the bike must have weighed more than a car , with all this heavy gear on , ' he said			0
' i just thought what a difference in technology now where they all have carbon frames			0
' it made me smile and consider how hardy @entity9 folk are			2
nothing phases us , and it 's going to be fantastic up here when the @entity11 arrives next month			2
' i jotted down a few ideas and mixed in a few jokes about @entity9 attitudes			0
' the video features figures from @entity87 to @entity17 among a series of great @entity9 landscapes , as @entity14 speaks with a dubious @entity9 accent over a hearty soundtrack			1
he can cheekily be heard telling the cyclists set to race that they ' need to know one thing - we do n't like bright colours as it scares the sheep ' and so asks them to ' pop on brown or grey cardies over your top while you 're cycling around '			2
local headdress : helmets will look out of place in @entity9 , so blend in with a customary flat cap kitted out : @entity16 's @entity18 is not just a top cyclist but also a world class cardigan wearer on the four - minute video , he also comments that having heard people are coming from south of @entity58 , he also suggests spectators wear a ' heavy duty donkey - jacket ' as it can get a ' bit blowy '			1
@entity14 politely asks that the last cyclist in the group ' shuts the gate behind them to keep the sheep in , as they do n't want them getting off everywhere '			0
he also suggests riders leave their ' shiny , strange looking ' helmets off the road in favour of a flat cap and that the king of the mountain classification may have to change it 's name as there was only one @entity130 in @entity9 , @entity132 cricket legend @entity131			1
@entity14 , a tennis coach , also had an ulterior motive for the video to promote his @entity11 camp site , @entity136 on @entity137 , which he 's set up for visitors during the race 's @entity16 sojourn			1
he said : ' there 's a lot of people charging a lot of money for camping during the @entity11 which i thought was very unfair			2
royalty : there 's only one king of @entity9 , says @entity14 , and that 's cricket legend @entity131 mountain stage : @entity14 was inspired to make the video by an elderly man pushing a bike up @entity137 ' everyone was moaning on @entity157 so i got in contact with a local farmer and set up a proper camp site really close so people can walk up there			1
' we 've had hundreds of people book in to stay and we 're by far the biggest campsite in the area now			0
even the @entity168 are planning to stay here , i 'm told			0
' @entity14 is expecting spectators from as far afield as the @entity171 to stay at @entity136 on @entity137 and the video 's done his marketing no harm			1
' everyone seems to love it , ' said @entity14			0
' it shows how amazing the @entity11 is going to be			0
' there 's a few coming from @entity171 , and also people from @entity180 and @entity181 , so we 're expecting a great atmosphere			0
' we 're all very excited			0
' and a final bit of advice from @entity14 - ' do n't forget wellies ! '			1
