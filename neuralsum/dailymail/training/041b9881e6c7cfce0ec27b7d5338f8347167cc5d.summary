by @entity0 and @entity1 rape victims were left traumatised after their attackers sent them threatening letters from their prison cells			1
@entity6 and @entity7 received ‘ hostile ’ letters written by their rapists while they were in prison			1
last night the women , who have waived their right to anonymity , said they had been failed by a flawed victim protection system which should have kept them safe			0
miss @entity7 , now 19 , was raped and sexually abused by her 44 - year - old uncle @entity15 between the ages of eight and 16			1
her attacker was jailed in march 2013 after admitting 22 charges of rape , indecency with a child , indecent assault and incitement against five children			0
shocking : @entity6 , 34 , whose husband @entity25 was jailed for 19 years for raping her , together left , and @entity7 , who was raped by her uncle , have been receiving unwanted letters from their attackers but only a few weeks after he was jailed , miss @entity7 , from @entity28 , received a hand - written letter from @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			1
she said : ‘ a few weeks after @entity15 was sent to prison i was at home when i heard the letter box clatter			1
i walked over to the front door to pick up the letters			2
‘ one of the letters was addressed to me and it bared a prison stamp			2
i ripped open the envelope , skimmed over the writing and started to scream			0
i grabbed my phone from my pocket and rang my mam			0
@entity15 had sent me a letter from prison			1
‘ he had written to me telling me he knew which pubs i had been in and who i had been with			2
i felt sick to my stomach			0
’ her mother @entity52 also received a letter from the prisoner , suggesting that she had been to blame for her daughter ‘ going off the rails ’			0
she quickly rang the probation service and they promised to step in to stop any more letters being sent to the house			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ the prison tried to suggest that the letters might have been smuggled out , but they had the prison stamp			1
we still have n’t received any apology from the prison			0
’ trauma : @entity7 's letters from her abusive uncle said he knew where she had been going after he was jailed disgraced : written on prison paper , her uncle was able to tell her he loved her and that he wanted to kill himself @entity7 's mother @entity74 , who ensured her daughter 's attacker had his sentenced increased , also received letters mrs @entity6 , who also received letters from her attacker , said : ‘ i have been told by police that prisons have lists of people inmates are not allowed to contact , but there are obviously flaws in the system			1
‘ i am disgusted that this happened at a time when i was particularly vulnerable			0
’ mrs @entity6 was repeatedly raped by her husband @entity25 , a policeman , who has since been jailed for 19 years			1
serial child rapist @entity15 , 44 , persistantly posted letters from prison to one of his victims - his neice ' but he was able to send 34 - year - old mrs @entity6 at least three letters during his time in prison			1
the first letter was sent from @entity100 in @entity101 where @entity25 , who has two children with his victim , was being held on remand			2

i could n’t believe this had been allowed to happen			0
’ mrs @entity6 , also from @entity31 , passed the letter on to police and assumed that it would be the last time she heard from her husband			1
but she received two more letters while @entity25 was being held in @entity101 and then a hostile one from @entity114 where he was sent after his conviction			2
prisoners have a legal right to send and receive letters in jail but their communications are supposed to be checked			2
any inmates wishing to correspond with their victims must apply to the prison governor for permission to do so – who should in turn get in touch with victim liaison officers before any letters leave the prison			2
a @entity132 spokesman said : ‘ there are very strict rules governing correspondence and contact between offenders and their victims			0
‘ any breach of these rules is unacceptable and will be dealt with swiftly and robustly			0
’ but @entity139 , assistant chief executive of @entity140 , said : ‘ something has gone wrong here – this kind of contact is not supposed to happen			0
abusive : @entity6 suffered for years because of her husband @entity144 , who has continued to torment her from his cell , even during his trial unhinged : @entity25 , a former police officer , sent letters declaring his love for his wife before they became more abusive			1
