@entity0 : desperate to take her first steps a mother has condemned the @entity3 for refusing to fund surgery which would allow her daughter to walk			0
two - year - old @entity6 was born prematurely and has a form of cerebral palsy which means she can not use her legs			1
an operation on her spinal cord would enable her to take her first steps – but health chiefs have decided that it is too expensive			1
now her parents are trying to raise the £ 25,000 needed for her to have the surgery privately			1
@entity6 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , was referred by local doctors to @entity20 , which specialises in the selective dorsal rhizotomy procedure			1
but the hospital , part of @entity24 , was denied funding by @entity26 – which does not routinely agree to pay for such operations			1
perversely , a 22 - year - old aspiring glamour model was given breast enhancement surgery on the @entity3 last year at another @entity31 hospital within the same @entity3 trust			1
@entity33 had her @entity35 breasts enlarged to a @entity36 with taxpayers ’ money , after saying her flat chest was ‘ ruining her life ’			0
her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local gp			0
under @entity3 guidelines , cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘ to protect a person ’s health ’			0
@entity6 ’s mother @entity50 , 40 , a former nurse , said : ‘ when you think that you can get a boob job or a tummy tuck on the @entity3 but not something that can help a little girl walk , it really makes me angry and upset			2
surely the type of treatments should be prioritised in terms of what is essential			0
' when i was told we needed £ 25,000 for the operation my world came crashing down			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous as £ 25,000 is a lot of money for a family to try to raise , but if it means @entity6 can walk then it is all worth it			1
’ family : @entity6 with brother @entity73 and parents @entity50 and @entity75 - who are trying to raise £ 25,000 for their daughter 's operation last year , an aspiring model was given breast enhancement surgery at the same @entity24 which is unable to operate on @entity6 , pictured @entity33 , who hit the headlines when she had her breasts enhanced on the @entity3 last year @entity6 was born prematurely at 33 weeks and she spent most of the first year of her life in hospital			1
her mother noticed that at 18 months old she was ‘ bunny hopping ’ rather than walking and she was diagnosed with spastic diplegia			0
sufferers of the condition are unable to use their legs as the signals from the brain do not reach the muscles , causing agonising contractions			0
@entity6 has been undergoing painful intensive therapy to strengthen her muscles and spends an hour each day in a frame to help her stand			2
although the ten - hour procedure would allow her to take her first steps , it would take months of further therapy before she could walk freely and unaided			1
mrs @entity6 has set up an online fundraising page for the operation called @entity6 ’s @entity104 , which has so far raised more than £ 1,300			1
she and her husband @entity75 , 44 , and son @entity73 , 13 , are raising money with the help of @entity109 , a charity that helps families with disabled children			0
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ she is such a bubbly little girl but i get sad when i see her watching her friends from the sidelines and not being able to get involved			2
‘ she always says to me “ mummy walk ” and you can see how desperate she is to take those first steps			0
’ the family is hoping to raise the money before @entity6 turns three			2
their @entity123 fundraising page reads : ‘ hello , my name is @entity6 and i am two years old			2
i was born premature at 33 weeks and weighed just 3lbs 8oz and i spent most of the first year of my life in hospital			2
‘ in july 2013 my mummy and daddy were told that i had a condition called spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy that means i ca n’t stand , walk or run like my friends do			1
‘ i have to do special exercises and use a standing frame for one hour every day which helps my muscles and joints to get stronger			0
