the @entity7 saga has echoes of the recent case involving @entity51 , the @entity54 news editor who was moved sideways into another department despite having numerous complaints upheld against him			1

’ another said : ‘ he has been moved to a plum job – he has been given the keys to the sweet shop			0

it is @entity125 all over again			0
‘ the bullying really affected a lot of people			0
after the complaint was finally finished one person said to me , “ i can finally sleep now			0
” others who said they thought they were quite resolute and could cope with it also admitted they were struggling			0
’ @entity135 mp @entity134 , a member of the @entity136 , pointed to a ' cultural problem ' of bullying within the @entity0 several @entity0 workers made complaints of bullying and intimidation against mr @entity7 last year , with other staff providing statements in support of those making the claims , it is understood			1
some complaints were not upheld , though the @entity0 would not disclose which			1
the source added : ‘ a lot of those that complained about @entity7 do not even know what parts of the allegations were upheld			1

he left the corporation after a petition signed by 15 journalists complained about problems in the @entity0 ’s arts department and led to him and an unnamed producer being cited for bullying			2

her @entity207 review , also known as the @entity208 , received submissions from more than 930 individuals and made recommendations , including resolving accusations within 30 days , and launching a confidential hotline through which staff could report abuse			2
the @entity0 said cases of bullying at the organisation are always dealt with and staff are supported when they make complaints - maintaining a confidential process in an interview last week @entity26 said : ‘ what happens when you say you wo n’t tolerate bullying and harassment is that you get a hump of more cases coming forward			1
that ’s to be expected			0
‘ these things take a lot of careful management but i want a culture where people can come to work and feel they are valued and do n’t feel bullied			0
these are not easy things to deal with but we are working our way through that			0
’ a @entity0 spokesman said last night : ‘ we do not comment on individual cases but where we find instances of bullying they will be dealt with			2
‘ the @entity0 is leading the industry in the way we support staff with complaints and this includes maintaining a confidential and fair process			2
‘ the fact that we do not comment on individual cases does not indicate that the @entity0 accepts that suggestions put to us by any newspaper are factually accurate			2
