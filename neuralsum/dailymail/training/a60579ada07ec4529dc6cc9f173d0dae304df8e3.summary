@entity0 's blog , @entity26 , was updated on saturday afternoon with an ' unconfirmed report that @entity0 has been captured at the border of @entity5 and @entity29			1
' ' that is not true			0
he is not in police custody , ' officer @entity21 told @entity6 on sunday morning			0
@entity0 has frequently used the rambling blog to keep the world updated on his bizarre attempts to evade captured in the @entity36 nation , which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection			1
he has in the past claimed that there exists enough material to keep the blog going for a year and has also stated that should anything happen to him a man named @entity47 would be put in charge of posting information - and it seems that day has come			2
in @entity5 , a source at the @entity14 embassy speaking anonymously to reporters said that friends of @entity0 denied he had been captured and that they and the police had no information on a possible arrest			1
rumors that the software developer has been apprehended come directly after an interview with @entity16 , in which he claimed his life was in danger and that he had tired of life on the run			1
@entity0 has been the subject of police interest since his neighbour , @entity13 , was discovered with a bullet in his head on november 11th			1
homecoming : anti-virus software pioneer @entity0 is on his way back to the @entity14 after his arrest last week in @entity74 in the brief talk with a @entity16 reporter , @entity0 said , ' i will certainly not turn myself in , and i will certainly not quit fighting			1
i will not stop my blog			0
' claiming that he will either be arrested or get away , clarifying ' get away does n't mean leave the country			0
it means they will , @entity83 , find the murderer of mr. @entity13 and , @entity85 , the people of this country - who are by and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out			1
' @entity0 and @entity13 repeatedly had run - ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in one interview with @entity92 claimed that the killers of mr. @entity13 were looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbour			1

the @entity16 report also noted that police in @entity5 have said they do n't consider @entity0 a suspect in the killing ; they say they only want him for questioning			2

’ @entity0 said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy , including police departments and homeless agencies , but not through the @entity5 government itself			2
‘ i do n’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out because if i give $ 5 million to the government , $ 10,000 goes to the people and $ 4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the politicians , ’ he said			0
‘ i give directly to the people			0
and i have been doing this all along			0
’ @entity0 , founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name , said he has been hiding out in the jungles if @entity5 and wearing disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies			1

he has said on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody			0
he has also said the he was set up by the @entity5 government and that it all goes back to a bribe he did n't pay to a politician			0

over the past three weeks he has given multiple media appearances , including two interviews with @entity118 , an interview with @entity191 , an interview with @entity193 , and an interview with @entity92			0
he also set up a blog , where he details his jungle adventures , his ongoing claims of government corruption , his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath salts , and his own personal investigation into @entity13 ’s murder			1
a few days after the news of his hiding made headlines , @entity0 logged onto the @entity207 to seek technical support on how phone tracking works , @entity203 reported			2
