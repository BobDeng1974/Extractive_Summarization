the @entity0 today went on to a war footing as its commander upped his troops ' readiness for operations			0
the move by general @entity7 , coming after the shooting down of a @entity10 drone and the ransacking of the @entity13 embassy in @entity14 , will raise fears among citizens in the @entity17 that the @entity18 are escalating towards major conflict			1
but following on from mysterious explosions at @entity30 nuclear sites , the kidnapping and assassination of scientists and possible sabotage of computers using a virus , an increasing number of experts are suggesting that combat has already broken out - a ' 21st century war '			1
operational status : @entity30 's @entity0 have been put on a war footing by the country 's spiritual leader @entity35 over fears of an attack by the @entity17 on its nuclear facilities the key area of dispute is @entity30 's rapidly expanding nuclear programme from which president @entity43 insists he will not budge ' one iota '			1
sanctions and mounting international pressure appear to have failed to persuade the country to slow down its pursuit of uranium enrichment			2
and many observers believe the blowing - up of facilities and targeting of key scientists is a more direct way of halting their ambitions			0
@entity57 , of the @entity58 , said he was under no illusion as to what was occurring			0
he told the @entity61 : ' it looks like the 21st century form of war			0
' it does appear that there is a campaign of assassinations and cyber war , as well as the semi-acknowledged campaign of sabotage			1
' what is not clear is whose hand is behind the ' attacks ' on @entity30 's nuclear sites			2
under attack ? a satellite image of the @entity0 base near @entity80 taken in september			0
a mysterious explosion destroyed many of the buildings last month sabotage ? the same base after the explosion on november 12 , which some have claimed was the work of @entity10 and @entity89 intelligence agencies one retired @entity10 official , with up to date intelligence , told the @entity92 : ' it 's safe to say the @entity89 are very active			1
' he added about @entity10 efforts : ' everything that [ @entity98 presidential candidate ] @entity97 said we should be doing - tough sanctions , covert action and pressuring the international community - are all of the things we are actually doing			1
' on november 12 , a huge explosion flattened the @entity0 base at @entity106 , killing 17 people including a founder of @entity30 's ballistic missile programme			2
a separate blast last week badly damaged the uranium enrichment facility in @entity112			0
two nuclear physicists were killed and @entity114 , head of the @entity115 , were wounded by bombs attached to their cars or detonated near them last year			0
advanced : @entity30 claimed yesterday to have shot down a @entity10 high - tech @entity120 drone			1
there are fears the regime could gain stealth technology information if they have secured the drone @entity126 , a nuclear expert at the @entity128 in @entity129 , said the intensity of the covert war indicated that this is where the @entity10 and @entity89 are putting their energy for now			1
he said : ' if the @entity10 or @entity89 were determined to take @entity30 ’s nuclear installations out they would n’t be wasting time pinpointing individual scientists like this			1
' but , he pointed out , @entity89 ’s 1981 attack on @entity140 ’s osirak reactor was also preceded by assassination attempts on @entity140 scientists			2
@entity126 said : ' some of the concern in the expert community is that in going down this route we ’re unleashing forces we can not control			0
' that is seen as a reference to the @entity151 computer worm which infected the nuclear facilities in 2010 , and was believed to be the work of @entity10 and @entity89 engineers			1
but a source senior within the @entity157 administration indicated that the @entity10 was not involved in every action			0
he added : ' i would n’t assume that everything we do is coordinated			0
' tensions : protesters set fire to the @entity13 and @entity89 flags during demonstrations in the @entity30 capital @entity14 last week anger : a protester breaks the emblem of the @entity13 embassy in @entity14 after a mob of students attacked the building @entity114 accused @entity176 , @entity89 and the @entity10 of conducting attacks on him and other @entity30 scientists			1
he told a news conference at the annual conference of the @entity181 ( @entity181 ) in @entity182 : ' six years ago the intelligence service of the @entity13 began collecting information and data regarding my past , my family , the number of children			0
' it was the @entity181 which produced a report detailing how close @entity30 was to producing the bomb that has racheted up tension between @entity195 and @entity14 in recent weeks			0
it culminated last week with the storming of the @entity13 embassy , during which time staff were held hostage and more than £ 1 million of damage caused , and led @entity176 to expel @entity30 diplomats			0
seeing pictures of the @entity205 torn and historic paintings broken only served to fuel the enmity between the countries			0
@entity209 , @entity176 's ambassador to @entity30 who lost his dog in the incident , accused the @entity30 of supporting it			0
that theory appeared founded when the handful of protesters arrested were released without charge earlier this week			0
damage : a shattered window in the office of the @entity219			0
several other countries withdrew their ambassadors after the attack last week , which came in response to further sanctions on @entity30 's nuclear programme then , on sunday , @entity227 's interior ministry announced that an explosion occurred inside a minibus parked near the @entity219			2
however , there were no injuries			0
furthermore , a plot to kill the @entity234 ambassador to @entity195 was uncovered and foiled in the @entity10 with @entity10 blaming the @entity30 , who were celebrating at the weekend the latest in the round of tit - for - tat propaganda victories with the downing on a @entity10 drone so hi - tech that no pictures of it have ever been released			1
' this is a big prize in terms of technology , ' a senior @entity10 military source said after the downing of the @entity120 drone			2
defiant : president @entity43 has said he country will not budge from its nuclear programme , which he insists is for peaceful means the @entity30 news agency said it was show down after illegally crossing the country 's eastern border , although a @entity10 military official said it had ' absolutely no indication ' the drone was shot down			1
neither the @entity257 nor manufacturer @entity258 has released much information about the plane , which was dubbed @entity120 in 2007 when its existence was finally confirmed			0
early reports suggested that the plane - which supposedly has a wingspan of about 65ft and can fly at around 50,000ft - would be made almost entirely without metal to help it dodge radar			0
the @entity268 declined to comment but officials did not seem unduly alarmed , suggesting that the drone 's capture would not provide @entity30 with significant information about @entity10 surveillance technology and techniques			1
@entity275 , president of the @entity276 in @entity195 , said the build - up of incidents ' add up to a very worrisome picture '			0
this was , he said , in part because ' the @entity30 are absorbing all of these assassinations without seeing the pace of their nuclear program slow down to the extent it would be acceptable to the @entity17			1
' but if @entity30 retaliations grow serious enough , he said , they could provide ' the pretext for a much larger war ' in which the @entity89 , and possibly the @entity10 , launch a full attack on @entity30			1
gen @entity7 responded by ordering @entity0 units to move long - range @entity295 missile to prevent them being targeted			1
a protest slogan opposite the houses of @entity299 in @entity300			0
many fear @entity89 could take preemptive action to halt @entity30 's nuclear programme the @entity30 air force has also been carrying out exercises to respond to any attack from the air and says it will deal seriously with any further incursions into its airspace			1
amid all this comes a report today compiled by the @entity313 for @entity314 ( @entity313 ) that suggested @entity317 efforts to stop @entity30 getting nuclear weapons had a real chance of failing			1
the report says the @entity10 would have to ' lead an international effort to contain @entity30 and deter the @entity322 from using its nuclear capability '			1
the conservative think - tank will release its report , ' containing and @entity326 ' , later today			2
vice president @entity327 told @entity328 : ' the report is very much an acknowledgement of the very real possibility of failure of the strategy to prevent @entity30 from obtaining a nuclear weapon , and any responsible party should recognise that failure is an option			1
' the report says @entity30 could realise its nuclear ambitions before the 2012 @entity10 presidential election , with the @entity157 administration reticent to sanction action before the november ballot			2
but other @entity345 countries have insisted @entity30 does not represent a threat to the @entity17			2
@entity348 prime minister @entity347 told @entity349 : ' i do n't believe that @entity30 will develop a nuclear weapon			2
will they hit @entity89 ? how many @entity353 will die ? and you think if @entity30 hits @entity89 , their cities will be safe ? they will be gone the next day			2
' backlash : sanctions on @entity30 's nuclear industry were heightened after a report was published last month which revealed the @entity322 was likely to be developing nuclear weapons			1

@entity30 moves long - range missiles to prevent them being targeted in an attack
follows mysterious blasts at military base and uranium depot in last month
expert says ' assassinations , cyber war and sabotage already under way '
advanced @entity377 drone crash lands in mountains
think - tank warns efforts to prevent @entity30 getting nuclear weapons could fail
@entity348 vice president insists @entity30 is not a threat to @entity89 or the @entity17
@entity10 insists @entity30 is becoming ' pariah ' state for *flouting* international rules
