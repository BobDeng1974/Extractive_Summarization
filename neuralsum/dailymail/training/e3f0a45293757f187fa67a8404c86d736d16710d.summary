by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 13 december 2012 a couple furious with the work a builder has done on their home have posted a huge banner outside the house warning locals that he is a ' cowboy '			1
@entity7 and @entity8 paid @entity9 more than £ 7,000 to transform their new semi into a dream home , but claim he wrecked the house with shoddy workmanship			1
the couple now say they want to stop others from being ' conned ' by the builder , whom they accuse of ' ruining lives '			2
fury : @entity7 outside her home in @entity25 , @entity26 which she claims was ruined by a ' cowboy builder ' ms @entity7 and mr @entity8 , who recently became engaged , employed @entity9 to build a conservatory , extend their kitchen , fit a wood burner , knock through two rooms , fit a new bathroom , then plaster and paint the house in @entity25 , @entity26			1
but they say he committed 25 different blunders which will cost them £ 12,000 to repair , and in protest they have written ' @entity9 cowboy builder ? ' on a banner he left hanging on the scaffolding outside their home			1
the couple were furious with the builder 's work - but they say that instead of offering to repair the damage , @entity9 demanded a £ 500 bonus before he would leave			1
they have remortgaged their home to pay for the repairs - less than a week after moving in			0
chaos : ms @entity7 posing inside the home , which was supposed to have been renovated by @entity9 ' shoddy ' : the couple claim @entity9 left much of the job undone despite being paid over £ 7,000 for his work mr @entity60 , 44 , said : ' he has conned us out of a lot of hard - earned money			1
we have no money left and every day after work we spend trying to fix the house			2
' it is bitterly cold , we have to flush the toilet with a bucket and we have no hot water to have a shower			0
it has been a complete nightmare			0
' if the government are not going to protect us against cowboy builders then i will make sure everyone in the area knows what this man has done and ensure they never employ him			0
' i want to stop him from ruining other people 's lives			0
' warning : the homeowners say they want to send a message to their neighbours in the wake of their ordeal the homeowner met @entity9 in the builder 's antique furniture shop , which is near ms @entity7 's pottery workshop in @entity92 , @entity26			1
he hired him for £ 7,800 after @entity9 claimed to have 20 years ' experience , and the builder began working alongside a colleague in late october			2
however , the couple became suspicious when he asked for an extra £ 4,000 to treat the roof for woodworm , and they started keeping a diary detailing his work			2
they say they found him using bathroom sealant around the fireplace and knocking down a supporting wall leaving a hole in the roof			0
they later discovered he was apparently entirely untrained after he told the homeowners he had swept the chimney ready to install a log - burning stove			0
a dangerous coating of soot nine inches deep was later found in the flue which could have started a house fire			0
uneven : the couple claim that @entity9 left the house in a nearly uninhabitable state last month mr @entity60 and ms @entity7 also discovered holes in the ceiling of the bedroom and bathroom , and accuse @entity9 of installing a cheap @entity125 wood burner rather than the reliable model he had promised			1
despite having no heating , hot water or drainage , and the roof leaking when it rains , the couple have had no choice but to move into the house , as the lease on the rental property where they had been living expired			0
they say they must now pay for digging up the concrete for the conservatory , replacing the wood burner and fixing the roof			0
ms @entity7 , 47 , claims she was tricked into paying @entity9 an extra £ 3,500 when her fiancé , who had already paid the builder , was away on holiday			1
@entity9 failed to reply to messages asking him to comment on the couple 's allegations .			2

@entity7 and @entity8 paid builder £ 7,000 to craft their dream home
but they say he left work undone and even put them in danger
couple wrote ' @entity9 cowboy builder ? ' on banner outside house
