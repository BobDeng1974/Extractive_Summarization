by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 's ok is all that stands between drug companies and patients who need healing medications , but a new study reveals the agency 's approval process does n't scrutinize some drugs nearly as closely as others			1
the @entity12 analysis published in the @entity13 on tuesday found that how the @entity2 deems drugs ' safe and effective ' varies widely drug to drug and suggests patients who think their doctors are doling out only safe and effective therapies should think again			1
' not all @entity2 approvals are created equally , ' said @entity21 , author of the study that bills itself as the first systematic look at the agency 's standards for approval			1
was yours scrutinized ? a study out of @entity12 reveals the widely varied standards the @entity2 uses to approve different new drugs a startling number of some 188 therapies approved by the @entity2 between 2005 and 2012 were given the ok without having to cite long - term evidence of their effectiveness or safety			1
only 34 % of the new drug approvals were backed by a study that lasted more than six months , according to the analysis of publicly available data			1
and even if a drug company 's successful study does last longer , it still does n't mean the therapy is any more effective			2
some 37 percent were allowed on the market based on the results of a single trial that was never replicated or confirmed			1
what 's more , most of the drugs were never compared to existing treatments to see if they are better or worse , said the study			0
fewer than half were compared to treatments already on the market			0
' many other trials were small , short , and focused on lab values , or some other surrogate metric of effect , rather than clinical endpoints like death , ' said @entity21			0
although patients may think that doctors only dole out safe and effective medicines , a closer look at the @entity2 process raised doubts			1
ok 'd but is it okay ? the @entity2 has a blemished safety record that includes drugs with major fatality rates			2
in 1996 , 18million prescriptions were written for fenfluramine ( left ) as part of the weight - loss regimen phen - fen before it was revealed to have caused major heart - valve damage to a third of users			0
@entity82 ( right ) was wildly popular in the early 2000s until revelations of its deadly side effects on the heart became clear in the wake of the deaths of tens of thousands of @entity89 users cause for caution : @entity91 ( pictured ) has become one of only two long term weight - loss drugs approved in the years since the phen - fen disaster ' based on our study of the data , we ca n't be certain that this expectation is necessarily justified , given the quantity and quality of the variability we saw in the drug approval process , ' @entity21 said			1
these eyebrow - raising findings are nothing to ignore , but its authors admit there is merit to the @entity2 's reasons behind the varying levels of scrutiny			0
' the agency applies the same statutory approval standards of safety and efficacy to all drugs , but uses regulatory flexibility in applying those standards , ' spokeswoman @entity112 said in a statement to the @entity121			0
in some cases , the @entity2 's ' regulatory flexibility ' can pave the way for faster approval of ' potentially effective therapies for life - threatening diseases , such as certain cancers , or those diseases for which there is no existing effective treatment , ' said the study			2
to insist that all drugs meet the same standard could result in higher costs and longer wait times			0
still , researchers said the public and the regulatory community should be aware of the vastly differing standards for market approval			0
' based on our analysis , some drugs are approved on the basis of large , high - quality clinical trials , while others are approved based on results of smaller trials , ' said senior author @entity150 , assistant professor of internal medicine at @entity12			2
' there was a lack of uniformity in the level of evidence the @entity2 used			0
' the @entity2 does not require data on comparative effectiveness as part of its approval process , the @entity13 study noted			0
@entity150 said only 40 percent of drug approvals involved a clinical trial that compared one new drug to another , which he described as ' an important step for determining whether the new drug is a better option than existing , older drugs			1

the @entity12 analysis found the @entity2 allowed 37 percent of drugs onto the market after a single trial that was never replicated or confirmed
just 34 percent of new drug approvals were backed by a study that lasted more than six months
the study concludes that patients ' *assumptions* that doctors dole out *trustworthy* and effective drugs can not be ' necessarily justified '
