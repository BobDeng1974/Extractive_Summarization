he is no stranger to accusations of being a communist			0
and @entity3 did himself no favours today unveiling a new campaign slogan that critics say has unfortunate similarities to ones used by @entity9 and other @entity10			1
the president released his new slogan ' forward ' in a triumphant seven - minute campaign video			1
' @entity40 ' was also a slogan used by @entity41 in @entity42			0
it has been used as the title of a large number of socialist publications , reflecting the @entity48 conviction that the triumph of their ideology was an inevitable part of the progress of history			0
one magazine with the title was the mouthpiece of the @entity58 in the 19th century , associated with @entity2 trailblazers @entity59 and @entity61			2
commentators have been quick to point out that @entity3 ’s new motto seems to be borrowed from @entity66 ’s ' @entity65 ' slogan			1
but a fair few have thought of using ' forward ' in their marketing campaigns before , including chairman @entity9 , pictured above			2
the leader of the @entity71 launched his ' @entity21 ' campaign in 1958			1
in it , he aimed to create a communist society through collectivization and industrialization			0
the disastrous campaign resulted in the deaths of millions of civilians and is known to be one of the most deadly of mass killing in history			0
the campaign also witnessed economic regression			0
other companies that have chosen ' forward ' include : @entity87 , who opted for ' forward : a better ride for you ' , the @entity95 @entity94 ' forward ' newspaper , and @entity96 – a short film company			0
festival organizers in @entity99 chose the name forward for their five - day music , art and media event			0
@entity3 's re-election team today unveiled the new motto in the video that compares the president 's record on jobs to the preceding years of the financial crisis and trumpets his record			1
the film cites landmarks of mr @entity3 's @entity115 such as the auto industry bail - out , @entity118 's death and the end of ' @entity120 ' in the military			2
but observers have pointed out that the new slogan bears strong similarities to @entity66 ’s ‘ @entity65 ’ as @entity3 ditches his successful 2008 motto - ‘ @entity126 ’			1
the video that unveiled the slogan tries to make the case for @entity3 's re-election in 2012 by saying there is still more work to do going forward			1
the video begins in black and white with sombre music and depicts the year 2008			0
it shows queues of people searching for jobs and uses graphs to highlight declining employment rates that @entity3 faced when he entered the @entity140			2
news reporters detailing the bleak economic outlook are heard saying snippets such as , ‘ worse financial collapse since the @entity146 ’ and ‘ economic disaster			0
’ the video suddenly changes to colour when it shows @entity3 addressing his supporters in 2009 before rattling through his achievements since taking office			2
with images of everyday @entity153 going about their working lives , the video recalls the auto industry rescue , credit card and @entity158 reforms , healthcare reform , student loan reform , green energy investments , lower taxes for the middle class , equal pay for women and a repeal of the ‘ @entity120 ’ law that banned gays from serving openly in the military make up			0
in a move sure to anger the president 's critics and opponents the video then focuses on ' the victory no one saw coming ' - the killing of @entity118 on may 2 last year			1
common touch : the majority of the video rattles off @entity3 's achievements during office and shows him ' connecting ' with the ' ordinary folk ' surprise , surprise : the promotional video highlights ' the victory no one saw coming ' - the killing of @entity118 - this is the moment @entity3 told the world of the terror leader 's death the campaign also uses the video to target congressional @entity193 , saying @entity3 had to overcome @entity193 obstruction on @entity195 in order to pass legislation			1
' instead of working together to lift @entity153 up , @entity193 were waging a campaign to tear the president down , ' the narrator says over changing images of congressional @entity193			2
however , @entity193 have turned the ' forward ' motto on its head with the @entity205 creating the trending @entity207 hashtag # foward			0
they have used the hashtag to tweet : ' under @entity3 's budget , @entity153 can look # forward to $ 1.9 trillion in higher taxes			1
' the campaign says the video will be played for supporters attending the president 's first re-election rallies saturday in @entity217 and @entity218			1

@entity3 has moved on from his 2008 ' hope and change ' campaign with the *message* that there is still more work to do
motto has strong similarities to @entity66 's slogan : ' lean forward '
critics also point to @entity2 leader @entity9 's @entity21
*announcement* comes before the president 's re-election rallies this *weekend*
