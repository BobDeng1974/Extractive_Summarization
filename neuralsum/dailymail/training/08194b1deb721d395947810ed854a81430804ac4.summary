by @entity0 beads discovered on a necklace that was first excavated in 1911 have finally been confirmed as being made from space rock			0
researchers from the @entity6 's @entity5 conducted detailed analysis of the necklace using gamma rays and have been able to prove that the beads , originally believed to be made from iron , were in fact created using fragments of meteorites			1
the analysis is also the first time scientists have been able to assess how the beads were formed and it is thought that the @entity19 used the technique of smithing and rolling , which involved hammering the rock several times until it could be flattened and then rolled to form the bead - shaped tubes			1
researchers from the @entity6 's @entity5 conducted detailed analysis of beads and necklaces , pictured , first uncovered in 1911			2
they used gamma ray scans to prove that the beads , originally believed to be made from iron , were in fact created using fragments of meteorites the analysis is the first time scientists have been able to assess how the beads were formed and it is thought that the @entity19 used the technique of smithing and rolling , which involved hammering the rock several times until it could be flattened and then rolled to form the bead - shaped tubes @entity43 from the @entity44 first scanned beads found in a pre-dynastic cemetery near the village of @entity48 , in @entity49 in may , using scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography			1
the nickel content of this original metal was found to be high , suggesting that it could have come from a meteorite			0
the researcher also observed that the metal had a distinctive crystalline structure called a @entity60 pattern			0
this structure is found only in iron meteorites that cooled extremely slowly inside their parent asteroids as the solar system was forming			2
they found areas where the weathered surface had fallen away , providing what has been described as ' little windows ' to the preserved metal beneath			0
researchers from @entity6 's @entity5 then used non-invasive neutrons and gamma rays to detect the exact level of nickel and phosphorous in these @entity19 beads			1
lead author of the @entity82 study , professor @entity79 said that the beads were created by ' multiple cycles of hammering ' and not by the traditional carving or drilling stone techniques that were used on other beads found in the same tomb			2
@entity44 and @entity90 universities first discovered that the beads contained nickel in may			0
this image shows a series of scans taken of the iron bead that unlocked the mystery surrounding the presence of iron among the ancient @entity19			1
it also poses exciting questions about the way the cosmos influenced their religion he told @entity105 : ' the really exciting outcome of this research is that we were for the first time able to demonstrate conclusively that there are typical trace elements such as cobalt and germanium present in these beads , at levels that only occur in meteoritic iron			2
' it is also the first time researchers have been able to study the internal structure of the beads to reveal how they were created - showing an advanced knowledge and skill of metal work			0
the discovery additionally unearths a glimpse of the genesis of the ancient @entity19 ' religion and the divine attributes they attached to meteorites			1
' the sky was very important to the ancient @entity19 , ' said @entity131 , an egyptologist at the @entity90 , @entity133 , and a co-author of the paper on the discovery			1
' something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods			0
' dating from 3350 to 3600 bc , thousands of years before @entity49 ’s @entity141 , the bead analysed was originally assumed to be from a meteorite owing to its composition of nickel - rich iron			2
but this hypothesis was challenged in the 1980s when academics proposed that much of the early worldwide examples of iron use originally thought to be of meteorite - origin were actually early smelting attempts			0
the ancient @entity19 would have seen a meteorite as an offering from the gods and this suggests the jewellery may have been created as gifts for royalty or people of high standing @entity159 , professor of @entity160 at the @entity90 , added : ' meteorites have a unique microstructural and chemical fingerprint because they cooled incredibly slowly as they travelled through space			1
' it was really interesting to find that fingerprint turn up in @entity19 artefacts			0
' meteorite iron had profound implications for the ancient @entity19 , both in their perception of the iron in the context of its celestial origin and in early metallurgy attempts			1
dr @entity131 added : ' today , we see iron first and foremost as a practical , rather dull metal			0
to the ancient @entity19 , however , it was a rare and beautiful material which , as it fell from the sky , surely had some magical / religious properties			1
' they therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves			0

@entity19 created beads by hammering meteorites into thin sheets
these sheets where then rolled into tubes to create ' beads '
meteorite beads *predated* the discovery of iron ore by *2,000* years
they may also have shaped the ancient people 's religious beliefs
