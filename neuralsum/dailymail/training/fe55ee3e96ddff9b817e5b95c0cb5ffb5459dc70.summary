people could lose up to half a stone if they choose to cycle , walk or take public transport to and from work , experts have said			1
scientists in @entity7 have found that people who get the bus or train and those who walk or cycle into the office weigh less than those who get to work in private vehicles			1
the new study , published on @entity14 , examined more than 15,000 commuters â€™ body mass index ( @entity17 ) scores			1
the average @entity17 for men was 28 and the average @entity17 score for women was 27			0
the researchers from @entity24 and the @entity25 , found that compared with using private transport , people who travelled by public or active transport had significantly lower @entity17 scores			1
men who commuted using public modes of transport or those who walked or cycled had @entity17 scores around one point lower than those who used private transport - equating to a difference in weight of 3kg , or almost half a stone , for the average man			2
women who used public transport or actively made their way into the office had @entity17 scores around 0.7 points lower than those who drive themselves in to work - equating to a difference in weight of 2.5kg , or 5.5lb , for the average woman			1
the authors wrote : ' those who used active and public transport modes had a lower @entity17 and percentage body fat compared with those who used private transport			2
' a key finding from this study is that the effects observed for public transport were very similar in size and significance to those for walking or cycling to work			2
the authors wrote : ' a key finding from this study is that the effects observed for public transport were very similar in size and significance to those for walking or cycling to work ' ' this finding may have important implications for transport and health policy , as over the past decade the proportion of commuters who walk or cycle to work has remained stubbornly low outside major cities in the @entity89			1
' greater emphasis on encouraging a shift from private to public transport modes may plausibly have significant population health benefit and may be more acceptable to commuters			0
' doctor @entity94 , a research fellow at @entity25 , said the differences are ' larger than those seen in the majority of individually focused diet and physical activity interventions to prevent overweight and obesity '			0
the researchers said that although their study was large , no firm conclusions can be drawn about direct cause and effect			0
however , they say the use of public transport and walking and cycling in the journey to and from work ' should be considered as part of strategies to reduce the burden of obesity and related health conditions '			0
dr @entity116 added : ' further research is required in order to confirm the direction of causality in the association between active commuting and body weight			0

@entity7 experts found people who get the bus or train and those who cycle or walk weigh less than people who drive to work
more than 15,000 commuters ' body mass index ( @entity17 ) scores were examined
scientists found effects for those taking public transport were ' very similar ' to those who cycled or walked
