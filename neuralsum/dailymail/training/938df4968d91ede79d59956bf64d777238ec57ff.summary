by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:13 est , 25 november 2013 @entity3 grinds to a halt with a few inches of a snow			0
so spare a thought for the people of @entity9 - where it has been raining sharp black rocks			1
the torrent began on saturday when @entity13 spewed out pumice stones , dust and ash into the sky - but some of those living in the shadow of @entity22 's most active volcano simply carried on as normal			1
no residents had to be evacuated and the only disruption was when one road was closed for half an hour ' as a precaution '			0
eruption : smoke billowed from the crater of @entity13 , @entity9 , on saturday			0
it is 11,000 feet high two of the flight paths serving nearby @entity60 , 20 miles from the crater , were closed briefly - but not one plane had to be diverted			2
a video of the otherwordly rain , which lasted about 45 minutes , has been seen more than 150,000 times on @entity66			0
@entity70 film - maker @entity68 's shoes crunched through the streets of his native town @entity74 , which is less than 20 miles from the volcano and has fewer than 10,000 residents			1
mr @entity77 , 32 , told @entity78 : ' @entity24 falls from the sky about once a year but never this strongly			0
usually we have some little dust but you do n't get these big stones			0
' as soon as it started i was trying to film the build - up on my terrace , then i looked up and the sky was huge and black			1
i covered my head with a sweatshirt and went out			0
' the ash is not heavy but it 's extremely sharp			2
many cars got scratched and windshields got chipped as the stones are quite big			0
' none of us were scared because @entity13 always reminds us of its presence			0
sometimes you can hear it thundering and your windows vibrating - even the doors inside the house shudder			1
' @entity13 stands almost 11,000 feet above sea level , looming over the whole @entity70 island of @entity9			2
its last eruption on november 17 was even more dramatic than saturday 's blast and the mountain spewed out rivers of lava			2
it has been active for thousands of years , although its first eruption of modern times was thought to be in 475 bc. black rain : a piece of fruit stands out against the background of sharp stones which fell from the sky @entity24 : a woman is seen cleaning the ash from her porch in @entity74			1
@entity13 erupts regularly near the town the cloud of ash turned the sky black - and the stones which fell were bigger than any seen before the road in @entity74 has been turned black by the eruption , which was the latest by @entity13 film - maker @entity68 said the stones were light but sharp , forcing residents to take cover some people in the town were undeterred , driving their cars through the thick layer of ash fiery : @entity13 's last eruption on november 17 spewed molten lava down the side of the volcano			1
it has been erupting regularly for more than 2,000 years , occasionally killing thousands of people it is so well - known it was written about by the @entity148 poet @entity147 , who called its eruptions a ' roar of frightful rain '			1
eruptions are rarely dangerous , but they can kill			2
@entity13 's most deadly moment came in 1669 , when a series of blasts killed 20,000 people and destroyed the town of @entity60			1
but farmers stayed in the area because the constant eruptions made the ground fertile			0
@entity13 's blasts are known as @entity165 eruptions - caused when gas bubbles in molten magma accumulate underground and rise to the surface			1
these pockets of molten earth then burst in a fiery show , sending plumes of lava and smoke hundreds of feet into the air .			0

people in @entity74 , @entity70 , put up umbrellas to protect themselves
it is the latest in a string of eruptions by @entity22 's most active volcano
film - maker : ' you can hear it thundering and your windows vibrating '
most deadly in 1669 killed 20,000 people - but most eruptions are *harmless*
