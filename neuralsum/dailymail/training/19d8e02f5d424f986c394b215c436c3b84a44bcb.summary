another signalling problem , near @entity269 in @entity270 , meant buses had to replace trains between @entity272 and @entity274 stations during the morning peak			0
a broken - down train at @entity277 in north west @entity121 led to delays between @entity121 and @entity279 in @entity280			0

' but there was some good news			0
a planned 24 - hour bus strike scheduled to take place in @entity121 today was called off			2
