by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the director of the @entity4 has defended government programs that monitor phone calls and emails , claiming they have disrupted ' dozens ' of terrorist attacks			0
@entity4 director @entity10 defended the programs as ' critical ' at a @entity13 hearing on wednesday - a week after a former contractor , @entity14 , leaked information about the snooping			1
while he refused to discuss specifics , he did say federal data mining appeared to play a role in helping disrupt a recent plot to attack the @entity22 subway system			1
he said information developed overseas was passed along to the @entity24 and used to identify suspect @entity25 in @entity26 and uncover the plot			0
he pleaded guilty to terror - related charges in 2010			0
at the hearing on @entity29 , @entity10 also expressed his concerns about @entity14 's qualifications			1
he was entrusted with the government 's top secrets despite dropping out of high school			0
' i do have concerns about that			0
i have great concerns about that , ' he said			1
' we 're trying to be transparent here , protect civil liberties and privacy , but also the security of the @entity55 , ' he said			2
' if we tell the terrorists what we 're going to do , they will get through and @entity55 will die			1
' sen. @entity59 , who led the hearing on @entity29 , pressed @entity10 for further details on the activities that had been disrupted , but @entity10 said much of the information was classified			2
@entity10 said he hopes to reveal details of the cases in a week and pledged that the agency would be more transparent with the phone records program in the future			2
he said the @entity4 is amassing data and ' only in specific times ' with the okay of justice and a court , do they actually access it			0
insistence : @entity10 said that the country is much less safe now than it was before the leaks occurred in 2009 , @entity25 plotted with two friends to detonate bombs in @entity22 during rush hour in the middle of trains			1
last week , sources told @entity2 that thanks to the surveillance systems , authorities were monitoring an e-mail address known to belong to a member of @entity87			1
@entity25 e-mailed that address and revealed himself and his plans			0
he was arrested and now faces life in prison			0
when news of the phone - records program broke , officials quickly credited it with thwarting the attack			0
but the use of @entity98 to catch @entity25 does little to resolve one of the key questions in the debate : whether the government needs to take such vast amounts of data to keep the country safe			0
that 's because , even before the surveillance laws of 2007 and 2008 , the @entity24 had the authority to monitor email accounts linked to terrorists			2
the only difference was , before the laws changed , the government needed a warrant			0
to get a warrant , the law requires that the government show that the target is a suspected member of a terrorist group or foreign government , something that had been well established at that point in the @entity25 case			0
in response , @entity59 said the intelligence community believes that these surveillance programs are critical , but he added that he thinks they should not be made permanent and that @entity129 should be able to review and debate them periodically			0
@entity10 spoke out after @entity14 , a former @entity131 analyst , leaked information last week about programs that track phone calls and information from large internet companies			1
at the hearing , sen. @entity137 asked @entity10 when @entity14 would have been able to tap into virtually any call or email as claimed in an interview			1
' false , ' @entity10 responded			0
ahead of the questioning , he said @entity55 critical infrastructure - which ranges from telecommunications to water to energy supplies - is not well prepared to handle a destructive cyber attack			2
' on a scale of one to 10 , with 10 being strongly defended , our critical infrastructure 's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyber attack is about a three based on my experience , ' @entity10 wrote in the statement prepared for the @entity156 for a hearing on cybersecurity			1
@entity10 said the @entity55 has been and continues to be a target of cyberattacks by foreign nations			1
about 90 per cent of the nation 's critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector , and therefore is not under the control of the @entity55 government or military			2
' traitor ' : @entity14 , a former @entity131 analyst , leaked information about the surveillance systems last week while he made no mention of the leaks about @entity4 surveillance programs in this opening statement , @entity10 said it was vital to have a strong @entity176 role in cyberspace in light of what he called real and growing threats			1
' while we feel confident that most foreign leaders believe that a devastating attack on the critical infrastructure and population of the @entity55 by cyber means would elicit a prompt and proportionate response , it is possible , however , that some regime or cyber actor could misjudge the impact and the certainty of our resolve , ' he said			2
@entity10 told the @entity194 last month that the @entity55 was increasingly vulnerable to attacks like those that destroyed data on tens of thousands of computers in @entity200 and @entity201 in the past year .			1

@entity10 said the @entity55 is less safe now than it was before @entity14 leaked information about surveillance systems
' if we tell terrorists what we 're going to do , @entity55 will die '
he said the systems helped thwart attack on the @entity22 subway
he added he had ' great concerns ' about @entity14 's qualifications
