by @entity0 the @entity1 saw millions of men separated from their families and sent to the front line but very few were pitted against their relations			0
for the royals , however , @entity1 truly was a family affair			0
a new documentary has revealed how the roots of the @entity1 lay partly in the tangled web of royal family relationships - in particular that of the @entity13 - hating @entity12 of @entity14 and his cousins , @entity16 and @entity17 of @entity18			1
best of enemies : @entity12 ( @entity20 ) and @entity21 loathed each other despite being nephew and uncle @entity12 , the eldest of the three and the owner of a withered arm thanks to his traumatic birth , was notoriously difficult and had a strained relationship with his @entity30 mother , @entity29 or ' @entity31 ' as she was known to friends and family			1
in the @entity43 documentary , @entity34 , the story of how the young @entity12 's hatred of his parents , and all things @entity40 , in part , brought about the beginning of the @entity1 is told			1
his mother @entity31 was only 17 when she married @entity47 ’s dashing @entity45 , known as @entity48 , in 1858			0
it was a passionate love match that also fulfilled the dynastic dreams of her @entity14 father @entity51			1
but her first pregnancy almost ended in disaster , after she underwent a traumatic breech delivery			0
a @entity56 – too dangerous at the time – was out of the question and the future @entity12 had to be wrenched forcefully into the world			1
three days later , a nursemaid noticed that his damaged left arm hung limply at his side - much to his mother 's horror			2
' it cuts me to the heart when i see all other children with the use of all their limbs and that mine is denied that , ' she wrote in an anguished letter to her mother			2
' the thought of him remaining a cripple haunts me			0
i long to have a child where everything is perfect about it just like everybody else			0
' family feud : @entity16 ( pictured front centre ) was no more keen on @entity12 than his father had been mothers : princess @entity29 , mother of @entity12 ( @entity20 ) and @entity87 and @entity88 ( r ) ' this is the story of a proud mother who reacts really badly to her son 's handicap , ' explains dr @entity93 of the @entity94			1
' she tries to love him and tries to be a good mother but at the end of the day , she looks at him and sees a failure			0
' by contrast , @entity12 's cousins , the future @entity17 and @entity16 , were adored by their mothers , @entity88 and @entity87 - a pair of @entity105 royal sisters who married into two of @entity108 's most powerful dynasties			1
theirs was a shared childhood with summers spent enjoying family breaks in @entity105 at the home of their grandfather , @entity117 ix. both were taught to mistrust the @entity119 - later @entity14 - by their mothers , furious at @entity14 's annexation of @entity122 , formerly a @entity105 possession , in 1864			1
both were also in awe of their fathers , @entity21 and @entity127 , and became fast friends as a result			2
childhood : tsar @entity17 and @entity16 met during family holidays in @entity105 and remained close friends firm friends : tsar @entity17 and @entity16 were cousins and close friends thanks to their mothers @entity136 , pictured with @entity21 and their son @entity51 , hated @entity14 after its conquest of parts of @entity105 peacemaker : queen @entity29 , pictured with @entity12 , his mother and @entity21 kept the family united @entity12 , however , proved less than popular with his @entity13 and @entity18 extended family ; not least because of the treatment he meted out to his mother			1
as a teenager , he wrote strange - almost sexually charged - letters to his mother princess @entity29 in which he described dreams of kissing her hands and caressing her			2
' promise to do to me as i did in my dream to you			0
i love you so much , ' the future @entity14 monarch wrote in one epistle			2
but when she replied speaking only of art and politics , the already tortured relationship continued to worsen			0
and when his father died in march 1888 , his behaviour towards his mother was so shocking , it damaged relations with his uncle @entity21 forever			1
upon becoming @entity12 , @entity12 's first act was to have troops to surround the palace where his father died on the pretext of searching for for papers relating to his father 's reign			2
but his ire was really directed at his mother , as her furious brother was only too well aware			0
at odds : in contrast to his close relationship with @entity16 , @entity17 found @entity12 difficult troubled : @entity12 ( pictured aged 4 at @entity180 and later in @entity181 ) had an unhappy childhood not close : although related twice over , @entity17 and @entity12 were not close friends in a letter written to his sister shortly after her husband 's death , @entity21 wrote : ' his conduct towards you is simply revolting			1
his manners are not those of a gentleman			0
' but the family feuding came at a price : as relationships between the royal cousins waxed and waned , so did the relationships between their countries			2
aware of the dangerous possibilities , one woman did attempt to broker peace : queen @entity29 , the family matriarch			0
respected and listened to by all , even by her notoriously unstable grandson @entity12 , the @entity204 played peacemaker and ensured her family - and their respective nations - maintained good relationships			1
family : like @entity16 , @entity17 was devoted to his wife , a favourite grandchild of @entity29 tragedy : @entity16 and @entity17 remained close after their respective enthronements and until the end @entity12 , in particular , adored her			1
but it could n't last			0
in 1901 , when it became clear she was dying , the @entity12 rushed to be with her			2
when she died , it was in his arms and he helped to lay out her body			0
at her funeral , he rode behind her casket alongside his uncle @entity21 but with @entity29 gone , peace between the @entity18 , @entity13 and @entity14 branches of the family dissipated and @entity108 edged closer to war : @entity16 and @entity17 on one side , and their estranged cousin , @entity12 , on the other			1
@entity34 , tonight at 9pm on @entity237			0

when war broke out in 1914 , the cousins were pitted against each other
