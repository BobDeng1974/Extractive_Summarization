by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 16:45 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 30 october 2013 the @entity3 's director flatly denied as ' completely false ' claims that @entity1 intelligence agencies monitored tens of millions of phone calls in @entity6 and @entity7 during a month - long period beginning in late 2012			1
gen. @entity8 contradicted the news reports that said his @entity3 had collected data about the calls and stored it as part of a wide - ranging surveillance program , saying that the journalists who wrote them misinterpreted documents stolen by the fugitive leaker @entity18			1
and a key @entity20 senator added that @entity22 papers that leveled the allegations ' got it all wrong ' with respect to at least two countries – saying that it was those nations ' intelligence services that collected the data and shared it with their @entity1 counterparts as part of the global war on terror			1
but @entity8 testified in a @entity68 hearing that ' those screenshots that show – or lead people to believe – that we , the @entity3 , or the @entity1 , collect that information is false			1
' ' the assertions by reporters in @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity75 that @entity3 collected tens of millions of phone calls are completely false , ' @entity8 said			1
according to the @entity6 newspaper @entity77 and the @entity7 daily @entity78 , the @entity3 had collected the records of at least 70 million phone calls in @entity6 and another 60.5 million in @entity7 between december and january			1
under fire : @entity82 of @entity83 protests as director of the @entity3 general @entity8 appears to wipe his brow before the hearing deep in thought : director of national intelligence @entity37 prepares to testify in the @entity90 hearing beleaguered : @entity1 director of national intelligence @entity37 ( right ) and general @entity8 , director of the @entity3 ( left ) , looked forlorn as the hearing is interrupted by protestors thrown out : a placard waving protestor is escorted out of the @entity68 hearing @entity75 's @entity99 magazine also alleged , with help from @entity18 , that the @entity1 was engaged in persistent monitoring of @entity75 's telecommunications networks			1
general @entity8 denied it all			0
' to be perfectly clear , this is not information that we collected on @entity22 citizens			0
it represents information that we and our @entity112 allies have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations			0
' reporters , he added , ' cite as evidence screen shots of the results of a web tool used for data management purposes , but both they and the person who stole the classified data did not understand what they were looking at			0
' scandal : @entity7 paper @entity78 's front page on monday was dominated by claims that the @entity3 monitored phone calls made in @entity7 three - ring circus : during a hearing on potential changes to the @entity134 , @entity83 protesters stole the show until they were shown the door @entity138 message : anti-spying protestors wearing some eye - catching clothing tried their best to disrupt the hearing whenever possible silenced : a protester is escorted from the hearing room by police president @entity145 said he is instituting a complete review of @entity1 intelligence procedures in the wake of stinging allegations that the @entity3 has been peeping on foreign leaders through their phones and email accounts @entity154 @entity20 sen. @entity48 , who chairs the @entity155 , said tuesday that ' the papers got it all wrong on the two programs , @entity6 and @entity159			1
' ' this was not the @entity1 collecting on @entity6 and @entity159			2
this was @entity6 and @entity159 collecting			0
and it had nothing to do with their citizens , it had to do with collecting in @entity112 areas of war , like @entity169			0
' @entity48 on monday called for a complete review of all the @entity1 intelligence community 's spying programs , saying that ' @entity173 needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing			2
' in the weekend 's other intelligence bombshell , the @entity1 stood accused of snooping on @entity159 chancellor @entity179 's cell phone and spying on @entity182 president @entity181 's private emails			2
but director of national intelligence @entity37 told the committee that spying on foreign leaders is nothing new			0
' that 's a hardy perennial , ' he said , ' and as long as i 've been in the intelligence business , 50 years , leadership intentions , in whatever form that 's expressed , is kind of a basic tenet of what we are to collect and analyze			0
' ' it 's one of the first things i learned in intel school in 1963 , ' he assured the members of @entity173 , saying that the @entity1 routinely spies on foreign leaders to ascertain their intentions , ' no matter what level you 're talking about			2
that can be military leaders as well			0
' gen. @entity8 said he would rather take his lumps with the public and the press than stop a program that protects @entity1 from future terror attacks pause for thought : @entity213 looks deep in thought during the hearing in which he acknowledged that any monitoring of foreign allies should be disclosed to the hearing hearing : from left , deputy national security agency director @entity36 , @entity3 director gen. @entity8 , director of national intelligence @entity37 and deputy attorney general @entity55 , testify on @entity42 @entity37 hinted that committee members had been briefed on such programs , saying that in cases where the @entity3 is surveilling foreign leaders , ' that should be reported to the committee ... in considerable detail ' as a ' significant ' intelligence activity over which @entity173 has oversight			1
' he added that ' we do only what the policymakers , writ large , have actually asked us to do			0
' leaking egg on his face : fugitive self - styled whistle - blower @entity18 's reputation will take a significant hit after his latest revelation proved to be a dud that misled two continents @entity243 committee chair @entity242 of @entity244 began the hearing by acknowledging that ' every nation collects foreign intelligence ' and ' that is not unique to the @entity1 '			1
@entity37 pleaded with the panel to think carefully before restricting the government 's ability to collect foreign intelligence , warning that they would be ' incurring greater risks ' from overseas adversaries			0
gen. @entity8 dispensed with his prepared statement and spoke ' from the heart , ' saying that his agency would rather ' take the beatings ' from reporters and the public ' than ... give up a program ' that would prevent a future attack on the nation			2
the @entity266 reported tuesday afternoon that other @entity1 officials had confirmed @entity8 's version of events , and that the electronic spying in @entity6 and @entity7 was carried out by those nations ' governments			1
the resulting phone records , they said , were then shared with the @entity3 as part of a program aimed at keeping @entity1 military personnel and civilians safe in areas of military conflict			1
none of the nations involved would speak to the @entity266 about their own level of involvement in a scandal that initially touched only the @entity1 , but which now promises to embroil intelligence services on a global scale			0
on the record : director @entity37 answers questions from the panel during tuesday 's hearing disruption : protestors carrying placards and wearing glasses with the ' @entity297 ' slogan regularly attempted to interrupt proceedings anger : @entity159 is still smarting from the revelations that chancellor @entity179 's phone was monitored from 2002			2

gen. @entity8 , the @entity3 director , says foreign governments spied on their own people and shared data with the @entity1
the @entity3 had been accused of snooping on 130.5 million phone calls in @entity6 and @entity7 , and keeping computerized records
sen. @entity48 said newspapers in @entity22 ' got it all wrong '
@entity8 's denial will fall heavily on the fugitive leaker @entity18 and his journalist *cohorts* , whom the @entity3 chief said ' did not understand what they were looking at '
