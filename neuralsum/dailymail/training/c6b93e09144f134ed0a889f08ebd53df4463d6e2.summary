by @entity0 published : 17:40 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 17:40 est , 15 december 2012 pricey : this @entity2 artwork which was unearthed among household junk was auctioned by @entity4 for a staggering £ 589,250 when schoolteacher @entity6 was told that a dusty painting of an owl she had found in her attic could sell for about £ 70,000 , she was naturally astonished			2
but last week the estimate turned out to be wrong – by rather a large margin			0
the @entity2 artwork she unearthed among her household junk was auctioned by @entity4 for a staggering £ 589,250			0
the price has broken the world auction record for the @entity17 artist @entity16 , who painted the picture in 1856			1
his works rarely appear on the market and the highest price paid for one until last week was just £ 72,000			1
ms @entity6 , 66 , said of the sale price : ‘ it was such a shock			1
we were not imagining that in our wildest dreams			0
’ she stumbled across the picture during a long - overdue clear - out at her home in @entity29 , @entity30 , helped by her 69 - year - old partner , @entity32 , and their three grown - up children			1
the battered painting emerged from mounds of clothes , books and toys as the family made space around some pipes for a plumber			0
it turned out to be a picture that had been exhibited at the @entity46 in 1856 when renowned critic of the time @entity49 admired the softness of the bird ’s feathers as ‘ perhaps inimitable ’			1
mr @entity32 , who runs a rubber - recycling company , had long ago forgotten receiving the painting as a gift from his mother			2
ms @entity6 , an art teacher , emailed a photograph of the owl to @entity4 ’s , where expert @entity59 immediately saw its potential and the work was valued at £ 70,000 – as @entity64 reported last month			0
he said : ‘ i thought the picture had magic but there was n’t anything to support a price stronger than we ’d suggested in the estimate			1
everyone seemed to fall under its spell			0
’ it was bought by an anonymous @entity76 dealer – and now ms @entity6 and her family may treat themselves to a holiday in @entity80 or @entity81			0
and if they had n’t bothered having that clear - out ? ‘ it does n’t bear thinking about , ’ she said .			2

the price has broken the world auction record for the @entity17 artist @entity16 - who painted the picture in 1856
