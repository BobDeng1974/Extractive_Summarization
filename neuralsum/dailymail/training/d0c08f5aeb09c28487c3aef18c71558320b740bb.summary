the @entity28 singer had suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse astonishingly 90 per cent of them , 11,478 , also happened to be male			0
much has been debated about the existence of a ‘ 27 club ’ , an age when a whole host of talented musicians at the height of their fame have died , often through suicide involving drug or alcohol misuse			2
after @entity42 , who struggled with heroin addiction , illness and depression , was found dead - having shot himself in the head in april 1994 - the devastating effect fame had on his happiness was revealed			2
before him , came the likes of @entity51 rocker @entity50 in 1969 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 in 1970 and @entity55 in 1971			0

professor @entity71 found that the early 1990s were the peak years for death by suicide for musicians , with the amount of stars taking their own lives rising from 5.9 per cent in the decade before to 9.5 per cent			1
but she also discovered that over the six decades she studied , suicide rates were between two and seven times greater in musicians than the @entity14 population			1

the fatal shootings of @entity107 , who died in 1996 when he was just 25 - years - old during a drive - by shooting , and the @entity109 who died at the age of 24 in 1997 , are just two examples from the staggering statistics			2
musician homicide rates peaked at 6.6 per cent in the 1990s after it was just 4 per cent in the 1980s and 5.9 per cent in and around 1970			2
contrastingly , in the 50s and 60s more musicians died from accidents such as plane and car crashes , such as @entity120 and @entity121			1

her body was found in a bath tub at a hotel in @entity129 , @entity130 lead singer of @entity132 @entity55 died at the age of 27 in @entity134 after an alleged heroin overdose @entity136 , seen here at @entity58 's @entity137 during his bad world tour in 1988 , died at the age of 50 while he was preparing for his comeback tour @entity140 @entity52 , leader of the the @entity14 blues band @entity141 , died at the age of 27			1
an autopsy identified his cause of death as accidental acute barbiturate intoxication according to professor @entity71 ’s research female musicians tend to die in their early 60s rather than their 80s like the rest of us			1
whereas male musicians die in their late 50s compared to non-rock stars who die around 75			1
@entity122 - the most awarded female act of all time , who sold over 200 million records worldwide – died at the age of 48 on february 11 , 2012			0

he had feared for his life for some time as part of an ongoing @entity172 – @entity173 feud and because of his level of fame meanwhile , @entity136 also tragically died before his time at the age of 50 in 2009			0
the singer was preparing for his comeback tour @entity140 when he died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication , after suffering from cardiac arrest			0

professor @entity71 concluded that the reason musicians die younger than those that do n’t make a living out of singing on stage is because the ‘ pop music “ scene ” fails to provide boundaries and to model and expect acceptable behaviour ’			1
