' we got a call last week and it was kind of anonymous call and it almost sounded like prank			0
they said it was a kind of known band and it might be up to 100 people and they wanted to check our availability , ' mr @entity75 said			2
' only the night before filming their clip , they actually came in and said it was @entity1 and it was going to be a bit of a bigger crowd than originally expected			1

by 11am , they had reached that number with many fans queuing up since 6am			0
in between takes : a crew member checked over the instruments to make sure all was in check lining up : after the band 's manager asked fans to come down and see them shoot the video , the queue of eager fans began to grow strumming a tune : guitarist @entity38 walked along the street and did his thing ' when i sent out the tweet last night i thought maybe 20 or 30 people would turn up , ' @entity53 told the crowded beer garden of the @entity4 pub. ' i 'm relieved we got the 250 we need , ' @entity53 said			1
' the only thing that worries me is that i just hope not too many other people turn up because i do n't want them to be disappointed '			0
feeling the love : @entity13 sported a white badge clipped to his singlet that had the word ' love ' written across it just casually walking down the steeet : @entity13 was more covered up earlier on before shooting began as he was swarmed by crew members @entity224 mode : @entity13 kept a low profile in a black cap and matching dark shades before he eventually stripped down to a singlet for the shoot @entity53 said it was an easy decision to film the band 's video in @entity4			1

i used to live in @entity236 , ' he said			0
' when we knew that @entity4 was on our little routes in our promo tour we said that 's the spot where we want to do our shoot , ' he said			2
' it 's kind of based on a one man band because the track itself is quite dancey and electronic , ' he said of the shoot , with members of the band each wearing a one man band 's kit			0
' we wanted to bring it back to the human element of it ' all clear : while a red scratch was spotted on the musician 's nose on monday , there was not a mark in sight on tuesday taking a step back : at one stage lead vocalist @entity13 followed guitarist @entity38 's lead as they made their way to the set in uniform ? @entity37 and @entity38 from the band looked almost matching in navy jackets and charcoal trousers the shoot finished up at 3.30pm and every extra who turned up will be able to see their name in the video 's credits			2
