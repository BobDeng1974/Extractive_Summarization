by @entity0 published : 03:31 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 19:38 est , 27 august 2012 wellies , rain ponchos and stoic expressions ... what better way to face the @entity6 weekend washout ? although these revellers at the @entity10 had to brave the occasional shower , others across the country found themselves in a marathon 12 - hour deluge			1
many of us had already rolled the barbecues back into the garden shed , resigned to the fact that the sunshine was over			2
are those sunglasses really necessary ? these music fans do n't look too thrilled about being stuck in a field during one of the wettest summers on record dry ice : music fans at the @entity28 festival enjoy an ice cream as they protect themselves from the rain raining on their parade : performers shelter from the wet weather at @entity34 in west @entity35 then the heavens opened – and stayed open in some areas from first thing in the morning to well into the evening			1
and forecasters predict it 's not over yet – heavy and persistent rain will sweep through large swathes of @entity43 today			1
long rainy spells are due in the north west , west and @entity46 with the wet weather continuing into tomorrow in many areas			2
britons who had their hopes of a glorious @entity6 dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations			1
the wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported bites			2
there are even fears of a new ' superflea ' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem			1
@entity69 saw sales of creams shoot up by 150 per cent last week , while the number of people calling @entity74 for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years			1
sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year , according to @entity80 's consumer programme you and yours			0
dr @entity84 , veterinary dermatologist at the @entity85 , said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two			0
he said the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea , which - despite its name - also lives off dogs , ferrets and humans			2
later in the week parts of the country will shiver as temperatures plummet			1
they could go as low as @entity98 ( @entity99 ) overnight on thursday			0
forecasters believe the summer of 2012 never really got off the ground			0
@entity102 from @entity104 group summed it up			0
' already the summer we never really had is drawing to a close , ' he said			0
' given that june was one of the wettest since the mid 1800s and july was another very wet month – if you add all those together you 're looking at a fairly cool wet summer			0
' and there are some decent bouts of rain to come			2
' @entity46 faced the worst of the bad weather over the weekend , with strong winds , and heavy rain leading to minor floods			1
at the other end of the country , @entity120 and @entity121 took the brunt of a wintery storm sweeping in from the @entity126			0
the @entity128 - based @entity127 yesterday issued a yellow alert , warning of localised flooding as heavy rain and winds lashed the area			1
in @entity133 holidaymakers venturing out for a stroll ended up soaked to the skin in minutes and running for shelter			0
deck chairs went flying and boats in the harbour smashed against each other as near gale - force winds swept in			1
' it really does feel like the end of summer – and it 's one we will want to forget in a hurry , ' said @entity146 from @entity147 , who was in @entity133 for the wedding of her son , @entity149			0
' everyone 's cold , wet and fed up with this weather and it seems like we 've endured this for weeks			0
we wo n't want to remember the summer of 2012 for long ! ' plastic fantastic : it 's grumpy looks all around as @entity28 festival - goers endure a deluge to round off the @entity6 drip - dry : that beautiful body paint is n't going to last long under the driving rain sweeping the country glamorous spot : one passer - by look rather pleased to be hiding from the grey skies alongside such colourful figures making a splash : @entity166 , 12 , braves the chilly sea at @entity169 beach , @entity170 rare sight : @entity172 , 11 , and @entity166 , 12 , race each other to the choppy water on a beach deserted by other families who needs sunshine ? @entity180 , 10 , and @entity181 , 10 , dig into the damp sand on the cold beach , left , while @entity184 , 5 , and @entity185 , 5 , play in the grey sea saturday had already been a washout , with parts of @entity189 virtually submerged			1
in @entity191 , 27mm rain fell in an hour			2
sunday saw rare sunny spells in some areas , with families flocking to beaches in @entity121 to make the most of the brief respite			0
while the @entity28 and @entity10 music festivals continued despite the downpours , organisers had to cancel the @entity202 festival in @entity203 , @entity204 , after the site flooded overnight			0
it will be disappointing news for those hoping for a relatively dry day like yesterday , when festival - goers at @entity10 and @entity28 were treated to some sunshine amid the seemingly interminable damp conditions			2
great @entity43 summer : a holidaymaker struggles with his umbrella at the @entity214 in @entity215 , @entity120 abandoned dunes : tourists at the @entity120 spot wander along a deserted beach , which is usually packed on @entity6 battling the elements : the patriotic day - tripper is not to be deterred by biting winds and lashing rain take cover ! red and yellow flags mark the end of areas where it is safe to swim - but who would dare in such uninviting conditions ? hazardous : drivers had to take extra care while driving on the @entity234 near @entity235 due to heavy rain caught out : this cyclist in @entity238 clearly did n't expect to be riding through a deluge braving the elements : these hardy punters were determined to enjoy the sights of @entity238 whatever the weather driving you mad : a @entity245 battles through the downpours on a wet start to the @entity6 weekend go @entity248 : the @entity249 near @entity250 was crammed on friday as drivers fled their homes for weekend getaways			1

heavy band of rain moving in from the @entity248 triggering flood warnings
strong winds of up to *55mph* to batter parts of @entity43
localised flooding and strong to gale force winds likely in extreme south
@entity267 showers expected later this week
@entity269 have flood warning in place on edge of @entity273
couple in @entity276 *narrowly* escape when bolt of *lighting* struck their home , causing thousands of pounds - worth of damage
