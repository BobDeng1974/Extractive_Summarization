by @entity1 reporter published : 22:19 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 22:40 est , 12 september 2012 one out of three @entity2 mistakenly believe that a majority of @entity4 are undocumented immigrants , and according to a new poll , the media is largely responsible for this misconception			1
the @entity9 released data which suggest that more than 30 per cent of @entity2 are certain that more than half of all @entity12 living in the @entity13 are here illegally , although the actual figure stands at around 18 per cent			1
in addition , only 37 per cent of @entity13 @entity4 are actually immigrants from other countries			1
misconception : more than 30 per cent of @entity19 @entity2 believe that a majority of @entity12 are in the @entity13 illegally one of two non-latinos think ' welfare recipient ' describes more than half of all @entity12 very or somewhat well , as well as ' less educated ' and ' refuse to learn @entity25 , ' @entity21 reported			1
results of a new poll released by the @entity28 and latino decisions point an accusing finger at the media , which feature negative portrayals of @entity12 that help shape public opinion			2
' the media is doing a disservice with coverage that is misleading the public about @entity12 who live in the @entity13 , ' said @entity28 president and ceo @entity38			2
' it is producing attitudes among non-latinos that contribute to hate speech and hate crimes			0
we must demand that the media do a better job with its coverage			0
' @entity29 conducted an online interactive experiment with over 3,000 non-latino participants who were randomly shown either negative or positive one - minute clips of @entity4			0
according to the study , being exposed to just one negative clip made it more likely that the viewer would associate @entity4 with crime , families that are too large and illegal immigration			1
bad rep : seventy one per cent of those polled said they usually see @entity4 depicted as criminals or gang members for example , 49 per cent of participants in the poll who heard a negative radio clip thought @entity4 take jobs away from @entity2 , whereas 33 per cent of those who heard a positive radio story shared that view			1
after seeing a positive news clip , 68 per cent of respondents thought @entity4 were ‘ honest , ’ compared to 53 per cent who saw a negative clip , and 61 per cent thought @entity4 were ‘ neighborly and welcoming			2
’ image problem : the study found less than half of non-latinos describe hispanics as patriotic , even after watching positive tv news coverage of the community one of the most enduring misconceptions about hispanic - americans , however , is their legal status in the @entity13 even after watching @entity21 actor @entity86 play a @entity13 president on @entity88 , 54 per cent of respondents still thought ‘ illegal immigrants ’ applied to @entity12			1
the study also found less than half ( 47 per cent ) of non-latinos describe @entity4 as patriotic , even after watching positive tv news coverage of @entity12			1
and according to the study , what @entity19 @entity2 choose to watch and listen to plays a major role in shaping their view of @entity12			0
for example , 41 per cent of conservative radio talk show listeners think @entity12 take jobs away from other @entity2 , over twice the rate of @entity103 listeners			0
as part of the study , 900 @entity19 participants were asked about their views of @entity12 and their portrayals in movies and on tv			0
seventy one per cent of respondents said they usually see @entity4 depicted as criminals or gang members			2
in contrast , only five per cent of the participants said they see @entity12 cast in roles of doctors , lawyers or judges			0
stigma : many @entity2 who are exposed to negative press coverage f @entity12 associate them with families that are too large however , there are also some positive trends that emerged from the survey			0
over 75 per cent of those polled think @entity12 are family - oriented , hard - working , religious and honest			0
another positive bit of news is that young people are more likely to develop relationships with @entity12 , which may help break down the old stereotypes			0
