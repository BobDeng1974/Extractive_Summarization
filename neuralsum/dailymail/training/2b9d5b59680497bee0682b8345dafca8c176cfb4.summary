by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 15:31 est , 2 january 2013 he may be the infamous founder of @entity3 fascism who allied with @entity4 , tore up democracy and introduced a string of anti-semitic laws to @entity3			1
but it seems former dictator @entity9 is still lauded in the country almost 70 years after he was shot , strung up by piano wire and his body spat upon by passers by			0
many @entity3 are marking the dawn of a new year by adorning their walls with calendars featuring pictures of @entity18			1
resurgence : former @entity3 dictator @entity9 , pictured left in 1940 , is still lauded by many with sales of calendars featuring his image said to be selling in higher numbers than a decade ago and while calendars featuring @entity9 are nothing new - they go on sale alongside ones featuring sports stars and animals every year - worryingly sales are on the up according to one of the firms that makes them , with many young @entity3 starting to idolise the dictator once again			1
@entity36 , head of @entity39 printer @entity37 , told @entity40 that his company are selling more @entity9 calendars than they were a decade ago			0
he said : ' i did n't think it was still a phenomenon , but young people are buying them now too			0
' the re-emergence of @entity9 ideology seems to have made something of a resurgence in @entity3			1
fascism has long left its mark on the country , with groups of so - called @entity55 sporting extreme views that hark back to 1920s @entity3 taking to the nation 's football terraces for several decades			1
but the cult - figure appears to have slipped back into mainstream public consciousness			0
he is venerated by neo-fascist youths who stormed @entity39 high schools back in october clutching neo-fascist flags and launching smoke bombs into classrooms while lessons were going on			0
popular : calendars of the @entity3 dictator are nothing new - pictured are calendars from this year and last - but sales are said to be on the increase by manufacturer @entity37 the capital has been rocked by an increase in extreme right militancy since the autumn with neo-fascist youth group @entity77 holding weekly demonstrations in @entity39 that have often ended in violent clashes with police			1
and in november , an attack on @entity83 fans , who had travelled to @entity39 for a @entity85 match against @entity87 giants @entity86 , was linked to neo-facist fans			0
a 25 - year - old @entity83 fan , @entity89 , was stabbed in that incident			0
earlier in 2012 , a village south of @entity39 paid tribute to field marshal @entity93 by splashing out Â£ 100,000 on a statue of the infamous general			0
a leading businessman also mooted the idea of renaming @entity99 airport in northern @entity3 as @entity100			1
idolised : fascist ideology has been adopted by extreme football fans known as @entity55 for decades , but @entity9 's views seem to be re-emerging in mainstream consciousness not only is the re-emergence of fascist ideas attributed partly to @entity107 who brought post-fascist conservatives into his coalition government in 1994 and 2001			0
but while @entity110 sought to distance itself from @entity112 following the fall of the @entity114 in 1945 , @entity3 has never fully endorsed powers that outlaw the existence of fascist parties drawn up in 1952			1
partly because it posed a risk to the italian constitution and partly because of a ' sneaking admiration ' for fascist ideology , according to @entity122 , politics professor at the @entity123			0
his resurgence as an idol among some @entity3 is also said to be the result of the recession , which has hit @entity3 particularly hard			1
the country is in the grip of its fourth recession in a decade and its economy has barely grown in that period			1
@entity3 's national debt is among the largest in @entity133			1
and it is thought that many young @entity3 are increasingly looking to right wing groups and ideologies in the hope that a strong leader may emerge and improve the nation 's fortunes			1
of course @entity3 was in financial dire straits following the @entity141 and @entity9 's economic fascism saw the economy grow more than 20 per cent in four years at the start of the 1920s and unemployment fall by almost 80 per cent			1
@entity3 neo-fascist group @entity149 's vice-president @entity148 told @entity40 : ' whoever buys the ( @entity9 ) calendar admires his work - the two things can not be separated			1
' there is a need today for his politics , for someone who will put the banks and finance at the service of @entity3			1
' @entity9 pictured giving a fascist salute @entity9 was born in @entity162 , northern central @entity3 , in july 1883			1
the son of a blacksmith , he moved to @entity165 in 1902 because jobs were scarce in his home region and became involved with socialist politics there			0
he moved back to @entity3 two years later and began work as a journalist on socialist papers			2
@entity9 later broke from socialist ideologies when @entity3 decided to enter @entity141 and he was enlisted in the army in 1915			2
he formed the @entity175 following the war in 1919 and capitalised on the support of unemployed veterans organising supporters into squads known as the @entity181 who terrorised anyone who disagreed with their politics			0
as @entity3 fell into political chaos in the autumn of 1922 , @entity9 's @entity181 marched on @entity39 and he was invited to form a government			2
he made himself dictator in 1925 and gave himself the nickname @entity18 , setting about re-establishing @entity3 as a major @entity133 power			2
@entity9 supported @entity192 in the @entity193 and became involved in an increasingly strong alliance with @entity4 's @entity110			0
his declaration of war on @entity196 and @entity197 in june 1940 exposed @entity3 military weakness and was followed by a series of defeats in @entity201 and @entity202 and the @entity203			2
in july 1943 , @entity205 troops landed in @entity206			0
@entity9 was overthrown and imprisoned by his former colleagues in the @entity209 government			0
in september , @entity3 signed an armistice with the @entity211			2
the @entity110 army began the occupation of @entity3 and @entity9 was rescued by @entity110 commandos			2
he was installed as the leader of a new government , but had little power			0
he was eventually killed in april 1945 by partisan @entity3 as the @entity211 moved north through @entity3 .			2

calendar sales have increased over the past decade
a surge in support for neo-fascism in @entity3 is blamed on the recession
