true to its word , @entity0 has ramped up security on its @entity4 service by including backups in its two - step verification process			1

when two - step verification is enabled , users will now need to enter a code to access their account - however , the @entity33 feature will remain open ( pictured ) the code is n't needed when a backup takes place , because the information is coming directly from a trusted device - it is only needed when users try to access their @entity4 account from a web browser			1

it is assumed that if a user does n't have their trusted device , they ca n't receive the four - digit verification code			2
two - step verification is an optional security feature , and settings are managed through the @entity96			1
two - step verification , also called two - factor authentication , requires a user to have two of three things to access an account			1
