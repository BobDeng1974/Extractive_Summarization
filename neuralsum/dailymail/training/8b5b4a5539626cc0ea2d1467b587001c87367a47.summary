by @entity0 whether it 's stress or having a blazing row with your partner , the triggers that lead to comfort eating are myriad - and can cause you to pile on the pounds			1
now a psychologist and diet expert claims to have uncovered the ' emotional triggers ' that lead to comfort eating and what you can do to avoid them			1
dr @entity12 says identifying the stresses that send you into a frenzy of comfort eating need to be identified before you can lose weight but adds that once you do , shifting excess pounds becomes easy			1
comfort food : emotional triggers such as rows can lead to comfort eating - and piling on the pounds weighty problem : dr @entity23 says emotional eating is one of the chief causes of weight gain ' first you need to identify that you 're overeating whether that 's with crisps , doughnuts , cake or whatever , ' she explains in an exclusive interview with @entity34			1
' it could be something in the here and now - for instance , you might not be getting on with a colleague or you might have financial issues - or it could be something more long term such as having a feud with your neighbour or falling out with your parents			2
' whether it 's a bad neighbour or a row with your other half , according to dr @entity12 , it 's essential that you recognise when you 're comfort eating rather than tucking in because you 're genuinely hungry			1
' you need to ask yourself : " am i eating because i 'm hungry ? " , ' says dr @entity12			1
' if you 're not , then you need to find some motivation to do something about it			2
but if you genuinely are hungry then eat			2
' @entity56 's burgeoning obesity crisis - the most recent figures show that 70 per cent of @entity56 people are overweight or obese - has been blamed on everything from sedentary lifestyles to sugary snacks			2
but that 's not the whole story , says dr @entity12 , who says that emotional reasons contribute a significant amount to @entity56 's bulging waistline			1
' people are overweight for emotional reasons , ' reveals dr @entity12			1
' it 's a huge problem and it 's not always recognised			0
' people understand comfort eating like indulging in a bar of chocolate to get away from what 's going on in your life at that moment			2
it 's a vicious cycle , and you need to get out of it			0
' so what do you do when oscillating emotions send you reaching for the biscuits ? dr @entity12 's solution is what she describes as a ' 10 - minute self - intervention '			1
flashpoints : living with an unpleasant neighbour or rows with a partner are both common triggers solution : dr @entity12 suggests giving yourself 10 minutes to reconsider before eating ' if you 're in a coffee shop and you fancy a chocolate biscuit , wait 10 minutes before coming back to it to see if you still want it , ' she suggests			1
' nine times out of 10 you wo n't			0
if you ride the wave of anxiety , you will feel so much better for not eating			0
' but it 's not just about identifying your trigger points and stopping			0
dr @entity12 , who is behind new book stop overeating : the 28 - day plan to end @entity103 , says combining willpower with healthy eating is essential if you want to shift the pounds			1
' i 'm not saying that we should n't have nice to things like crisps and chocolate to eat but everything in moderation , ' she adds			0
' these things are probably not the sort of thing you should eat on a diet but i do think it 's a good idea to make an agreement with yourself when you start the diet that you can always come back to these foods when you come off the diet and it 's not forever			2
' regardless of what you put in your mouth , key to losing weight is breaking the link between emotions and food , and slowing yourself down at mealtimes			0
' if you eat slowly you are conscious of what you 're eating , ' explains dr @entity12			1
' it can actually take 10 to 20 minutes for your brain to give the signal that you 're full , which means little tricks such as keeping a glass of water next to your plate can really help			2
' another exercise i get people to do is to acknowledge the length of time between having something in their mouths			0
' we are constantly grazing nowadays and we barely go 20 minutes without something going in our mouth and it ’s not always the good stuff			0
' and to deal with the temptation to use food as a reward for completing a task ? ' it is great to reward yourself but just not necessarily with food , ' explains the psychologist			0
; i always recommend buying something else like a plant or a brooch , and it does n't have to be expensive			0
' i knew a woman who would take herself down to a charity shop and pick up a brooch for 20p and it would be so much better because it represents her and it 's much longer lasting			0
' stop overeating : the 28 - day plan to end emotional eating for good by dr @entity12 , £ 10.99 , is published by @entity170 once you 've worked out what your emotional triggers are , the next step is to start slimming down with a healthy diet			1
although snacking is n't banned , dr @entity12 says making sure it 's healthy is key			1
' there is nothing wrong with a tv snack so long as it is a healthy one – one being the optimum word there , ' she writes , ' one really good tip is to make the snack take as long as possible to eat , celery with a cottage cheese dip for example or half a dozen nuts in their shells			0
' this is not just about the calories , it is about the time taken to eat			0
to satisfy your established grazing habits you almost have to trick yourself into believing that you are eating all the time , until you get into the habit of not doing so			0
