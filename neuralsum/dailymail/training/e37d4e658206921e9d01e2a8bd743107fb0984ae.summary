we can only assume at the end of this ferocious @entity4 derby that were @entity6 looking down a decade after his death , a wicked smile might have spread across his lips			1
the two clubs to which he brought unequalled glory clattered into one another for 98 minutes — such was the length of added time — and produced a match that made up in drama what it lacked in quality			2
@entity19 might also have been able to smack some sense into the pitch invader who managed to delay the match for an inordinate period and stoke even further an atmosphere @entity25 called the ‘ best ever in this stadium ’			2
@entity27 ( right ) scored the equalising goal for @entity29 against @entity30 during a goalmouth scramble late into the second half @entity33 scores the opening goal of the game between @entity30 and @entity29 as he puts the home side ahead the 21 - year - old gave @entity30 the lead after 71 minutes with a brilliantly taken left - footed strike @entity40 was shown a second yellow card for this late challenge on @entity43 as tempers boiled over on sunday both @entity30 and @entity29 fans paid tribute to former manager @entity6 ahead of the @entity4 derby @entity30 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity48 6.5 ; @entity49 7 , @entity50 7 , @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 6.5 ; @entity53 6 ( @entity54 15 ’ 6.5 ) ; @entity43 6.5 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 6 ( @entity57 ’ 6 ( @entity58 90 ’ ) ) , @entity59 8 ; @entity60 7.5 booked : @entity56 , @entity61 , @entity55 manager : @entity25 7 @entity29 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity63 ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity27 7 , @entity40 5.5 , @entity65 7.5 ; @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 76 ’ 6 ) , @entity68 6.5 ( @entity69 76 ’ ) , @entity70 7 ; @entity71 ( @entity72 69 ’ ) , @entity73 6 , @entity74 6.5 booked : @entity66 sent off : @entity75 manager : @entity77 6.5 mom : @entity60 att : 30,227 referee : @entity79 5.5 in the second half a @entity30 fan left his seat to stroll around the @entity83 , goad the @entity29 fans and swing his shirt round his head , only being caught as he returned to the stands			1
expert policing , this was not			2
shortly after the interruption , @entity30 took the lead in the 71st minute			1
@entity92 , a menace down the left , fed @entity33 , who turned adroitly to fire a crisp left - foot shot past @entity96 and send the @entity83 into raptures			1
it was the striker ’s fifth goal since his move from @entity101 and his £ 5.5million fee is looking a bargain			0
@entity77 reorganised his @entity29 side and in the 80th minute they equalised after a goalmouth scramble that should see @entity64 , on his league debut for the club , credited with the goal ahead of @entity109			1
@entity27 headed @entity111 ’s free - kick against the bar , @entity64 met the rebound and the ball crossed the line before @entity109 rammed it into the back of the net , even if referee @entity118 failed to blow initially			1
in the closing minutes @entity40 was given a second yellow card for a foolish challenge on @entity43			1
this match never looked like ending 11 v 11 and it was the sixth red card in the last eight meetings between these rivals			1
@entity30 stay unbeaten at the top of the @entity125 , with @entity29 yet to find the form that took them to the play - off final last may			1
‘ it was probably a fair result , ’ reflected @entity25			0
‘ i ’m a little bit disappointed in the quality of some of the football			0
i do n’t think we had enough devilment in our play			0
’ @entity25 lost only one derby match during his 12 years as a @entity30 player and knows the edge this game carries			1
but he praised both sets of supporters for celebrating the memory of @entity6 with a minute ’s applause in the 10th minute			2
‘ it ’s great to see , ’ he said			0
‘ there is one person who unites this part of the world and it is that man			0
’ more choice words were sent the way of the rogue @entity30 fan , who was allowed to walk on the pitch untroubled for at least three minutes			2
‘ it was pathetic , ’ said @entity25			0
‘ i have no idea why stewards did n’t intervene			0
’ @entity25 will today find out about the gravity of captain @entity53 ’s injury			0
the midfielder left the field after twisting his right knee			0
he wore the pained expression of a player who has missed two substantial spells with cruciate ligament injuries in the past three seasons			0
‘ we just hope luck is on his side because i know the hard work he puts in behind the scenes , ’ said @entity25			0
@entity25 ( left ) and the @entity30 bench celebrate @entity33 's opening goal in the 71st minute both teams gather in a huddle prior to the match as fans prepare to pay tribute to former manager @entity6 both sets of fans paid fitting tributes to mark the 10 - year anniversary of @entity6 's passing @entity30 fans wear @entity190 masks to mock @entity29 fans after their side were beaten in the @entity194 - off final last season @entity48 of @entity30 rises to claim the ball during the second half before squaring up to @entity29 striker @entity73 ( right ) @entity197 of @entity30 was shown a yellow card for this late challenge on @entity29 's @entity71 ( top ) @entity201 ( right ) swings in a free - kick during a cagey first 45 minutes in the @entity4 derby @entity201 ( centre ) of @entity30 recovered from a knee injury to take part in the game on sunday @entity74 of @entity29 ( left ) beats @entity30 's @entity52 to the ball during the first half at the @entity83 @entity30 manager @entity25 applauds the @entity29 fans ahead of the @entity125 clash against the team he used to play for @entity30 's @entity201 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity29 's @entity66 during the @entity125 match at the @entity83 the @entity216 on display during the @entity125 match between @entity30 and @entity29 at the @entity83			1
