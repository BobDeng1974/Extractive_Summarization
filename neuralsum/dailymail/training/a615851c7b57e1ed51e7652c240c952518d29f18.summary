the @entity0 has finally apologised for dodgy financial dealings that spanned over a decade and lost its customers hundreds of millions of dollars			1
on thursday , chief executive @entity4 faced the media to issue a long - awaited apology - a week after a @entity8 report slammed the bank for its poor handling of the scandal			1
' to all the customers who received poor advice , i apologise unreservedly , ' mr @entity4 told reporters in @entity16			1
' a @entity8 report - headed by former @entity35 senator @entity34 - blasted the bank and corporate watchdog , @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , for their lacklustre responses to fraud and misconduct allegations levelled at some of @entity0 financial planners			2
chief executive @entity4 has apologised to @entity0 customers who were affected by the scandal it also recommended a royal commission be launched into the bank			1
between 2003 and 2012 , customers lost large amounts of life savings after they were switched into high - risk investment products without consent , and in some cases financial planners were forging client signatures to approve profit - producing product switches			1
mr @entity4 also announced a review into the bank 's financial dealings over the 10 years called the @entity54 on thursday			1
it will allow customers to request a review of their case from the bank , and a further option would be available to have it reviewed by an independent panel chosen by the bank			1
mr @entity4 said the bank has already paid out $ 52 million worth in compensation to 1,100 people who were affected by the scandal , but some reports suggest the number affected might be as high as 12,000			1
but he said any more money to be paid out would be ' inconsequential ' for shareholders in the $ 130 billion banking giant			0
and investors seemed unmoved by the developments			0
@entity0 shares rose 63 cents on thursday to $ 81.55			0
but critics say the bank 's latest review does n't go far enough			2
@entity34 said the new compensation review did not differ much from existing arrangements			2
' i welcome the apology of mr @entity4 - that is a welcome development - but overall what we have on the table is marginal change at best , ' he told the @entity86			0
law firm @entity87 , which has represented affected @entity0 customers , questioned the appointment process for the bank 's independent panel and customer advocates			2
' if it 's the @entity0 that appoints them , then that 's not independent , ' @entity87 partner @entity93 said			0
former senator @entity34 chaired and handed down the senate report that called for a royal commission into the bank and slammed its response to the scandal but federal government figures backed the review , including treasurer @entity104 , whose mother - in - law was among those hurt by the scandal			2
' you 've got to have a plan to ensure that people are given appropriate compensation			0
they 're starting to do that but there 's obviously a way to go , ' he said			0
prime minister @entity117 played down the prospect of a royal commission into the financial planning industry			0
' i do n't want to overdo the reviews because in the end what people expect from government is appropriate action not endless study , particularly studies which do n't necessarily lead to outcomes , ' he said .			0
