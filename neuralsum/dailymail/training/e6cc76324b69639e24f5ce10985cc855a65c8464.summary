by @entity0 and @entity1 predator : @entity3 at a fundraising event for @entity6 's charity work in @entity7 a @entity6 pilot used his position to abuse hundreds of vulnerable children in @entity12 schools and orphanages , the @entity14 can reveal			1
first officer @entity3 , 54 , claimed he was carrying out charity work for the airline while molesting scores of young girls during his stopovers in @entity7			1
dressed in a bogus captain ’s uniform , he would use the airline ’s good name – and even @entity6 branded toys and colouring books – to lure children out on day trips and to five - star hotels used by the airline , where he would abuse them			1
@entity6 is now facing a hugely damaging lawsuit brought by his victims , who say the company failed to protect them from his horrific abuse			1
after abusing children for 15 years , the £ 100,000 - a - year pilot was finally stopped when he was charged with separate child sex offences in the @entity39			1
days after appearing in a court in @entity41 last month charged with the offences , @entity3 threw himself under a train			1
prosecutor @entity44 said : ‘ the prosecution say that mr @entity3 was a deeply depraved and corrupt individual who had used his ability to fly to other parts of the world to commit sexual offences against children			1
’ officials in @entity52 have identified at least 15 children , all believed to be girls aged five to 11 , that @entity3 abused – and say they fear there are hundreds more			1
as @entity6 launched an international investigation into the ‘ shocking ’ claims , questions were asked over why the pilot – who was arrested after indecently assaulting an eight - year - old girl in 2000 – was ever allowed to work near children			1
' prosecution sources said they feared the pilot could prove to have been among @entity39 ’s most prolific sex offenders			1
vulnerable : @entity3 at a @entity52 children 's home ( left ) and with a child at the @entity69 for kids infected with @entity71 ( right ) during his 16 - year career with @entity6 , @entity3 chose unpopular routes in and out of @entity7 , using his stays there to prey on vulnerable children in the slums			1
@entity3 ’s first known contact with children in @entity7 came in 2001 when he began visiting the @entity80 in the @entity82 area of @entity83 , the @entity52 capital			1
it was the first centre of its kind in @entity52 to accept only children infected with @entity71 , and managers said they had received no complaints of abuse against any of their children			0

officials in @entity52 say , he claimed he was a member of ‘ @entity6 ’s community relations programme ’ when approaching orphanages and schools			2
if managers complained about his behaviour , @entity3 made official complaints to the police that the staff involved were stealing from the children ’s homes , and at least two managers were arrested over his allegations			2
@entity3 first came to the attention of police when he was accused of an indecent assault on an eight - year - old girl			2
he met the girl while volunteering for @entity150 , escorting young children on a trip to @entity153 in 2000			0
@entity69 for kids infected with @entity71 in @entity52 had a connection with @entity3 - but managers said they have received no complaints of abuse against any of their children @entity3 was arrested over the sex attack , but – in an echo of the @entity163 scandal – the @entity164 ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him			1
he was allowed to keep his job at @entity6 and , in an indictment of the vetting system , continued his charity work with children			2
the mother of one young victim told the @entity14 her daughter was abused at a five - star hotel used by @entity6 crew in @entity83			2

i trusted him with everything , even with my daughter , ’ she said			0

when suspicions arose about @entity3 in @entity52 , one local school contacted a @entity39 law firm , whose staff travelled to @entity52 with a view to beginning legal action against both @entity3 and @entity6			1
