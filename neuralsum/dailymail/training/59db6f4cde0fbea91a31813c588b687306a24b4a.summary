with @entity1 and @entity2 banging in goals left , right and centre , @entity0 were widely acknowledged as this season 's great entertainers and the television companies seem to agree			0
@entity9 ' side were shown by either @entity10 or @entity11 29 times this season - meaning just nine of their @entity14 matches were not on tv			1
champions @entity16 were just three matches behind on 26 , while @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 both notched up 25 games			2
@entity24 found themselves bottom of the table with just seven appearances , with their only match on @entity11 coming on the opening day of the season against @entity0			1
@entity10 also showed their home fixture with the @entity33 giants , a 5 - 3 thriller			0
newcomers @entity11 obviously thought the way to go was to show the big clubs and that was certainly reflected in their coverage , with 81.6 per cent of their matches featuring one of @entity0 , @entity16 , @entity19 , @entity20 or @entity21			2
meanwhile , 91 of @entity43 ' 116 live matches featured one of those five , coming in at a slightly lower 78.4 per cent			0
capitulation : @entity46 on @entity10 showed @entity0 's dramatic 3 - 3 draw against @entity48 mistaken identity : @entity11 showed the controversial match between @entity20 and @entity19 which saw @entity51 receive a red card for a handball by @entity54 game changer : @entity11 had the rights to seven of the @entity14 champions , @entity16 's , matches perhaps surprisingly , @entity58 were shown on television 17 times - one more than @entity60 - although 11 of those matches came against @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity16 , @entity0 , @entity22 or @entity21			1
the table will lend ammunition to those who think the big clubs monopolise tv coverage , with the likes of @entity48 and @entity68 playing more exciting and flowing football than @entity21 this season			0
indeed , the @entity68 will possibly be most disappointed with their lack of exposure , especially as they have three players in @entity76 's @entity75 squad			0
unpopular : @entity24 found themselves live on the television just seven times and only once on @entity11 surprising : @entity58 were remarkably high up on the list coming in seventh having played in 17 live matches blessing or a curse ? united fans had the pleasure ( or not ) of watching their side 25 times on tv this season			1

@entity0 showed by @entity43 or @entity88 29 times this season
@entity16 shown 26 times , @entity21 25
