by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:51 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : sultan @entity4 led @entity5 from 1672 to 1727 and theoretically could have sired over 1,000 children as rumoured sultan @entity4 is known as a warrior as well as a the world 's most prolific father			1
the @entity5 ruler , who led the country from 1672 to 1727 is rumoured to have sired over 1,000 children			1
and while this might seem unlikely , scientists have worked out that it is theoretically possible , if the leader had sex once a day - for 32 years straight			1
according to computer simulations , the amorous leader , who was the first sultan of the @entity20 dynasty which is still the royal house of @entity5 , could have set the record for the greatest number of children fathered by anyone throughout history			1
the historical ruler holds the title in the @entity29 , which says that he fathered 888 children			2
but a @entity34 diplomat called @entity35 who visited @entity5 at the time , wrote that sultan @entity4 had 1,171 children by 1704 , as well as four wives and 500 concubines , @entity32 reported			1
scientists have previously dismissed the number of children as highly unlikely as women are only fertile for a few days every month			2
a team of scientists from the @entity46 created computer simulations to explore how many times sultan ismail would have had to have had sex to be able to father 1,171 children in 32 years			1
amazingly they found that not only was it possible , he would have had to have sex once a day over the lengthy period			0
anthropologist @entity55 , who was lead author of the study published in @entity57 , said : ‘ we were as conservative as possible with our calculations and @entity4 could still achieve this outcome			2
’ scientists from the @entity46 created computer simulations to explore how many times sultan @entity48 would have had to have sex every day to be able to father 1,171 children in 32 years - and they found the answer was approximately once			1
a painting showing the sultan meeting a @entity34 ambassador is pictured @entity4 is noted as one of the greatest figures in @entity5 history			2
he fought the @entity72 @entity71 in 1679 , 1682 and 1695/96			0
after these battles the @entity5 independence was respected			0
the ruler also liberated several seaports occupied from @entity77 and @entity78			0
he is thought to have used 25,000 slaves for the construction of the capital in @entity82 and displayed thousands of heads of slain rivals at the beginning of his reign			0
he ruled until the age of 80 and is said to have fathered 888 children in his time - although there are reports of 1,171 children			2
a number of different conception models were created			0
one model assumed the menstrual cycles of women did not synchronise , while another assumed they could and the quality of sultan @entity48 ’s sperm was also taken into account as well as how he aged			0
the study said that the ruler would have had to have sex between 0.83 and 1.43 times a day to father so many children in 32 years			1
the scientists also said that the rule needs a harem of between 65 and 110 women to do it – not the 500 concubines he is estimated to have had			1
however , dr @entity55 noted that the results of the study differed quite a lot depending on which model was used			0
while the sultan was free to have sex with different women , any suspicion of adultery by the women was severely punished			2
the sultan is said to have personally strangled unfaithful women as well as ordering their breasts to be cut off or their teeth pulled out			0
other men who eyed up the women could also be punished by death			0
@entity131 ruled for the longest period of time in @entity5 ’s history and is remembered as a bloodthirsty warrior			1
reports suggest that he displayed between 400 and 1,000 heads of enemy chiefs and political rivals in the city of @entity140 at the beginning of this reign and over the next 55 years killed over 30,000 people off the battlefield .			0

sultan @entity4 ruled @entity5 between 1672 to 1727 and was known as a bloodthirsty warrior as well as a prolific father
@entity46 scientists used computer simulations to work out how *frequently* sultan needed to have sex to father 1,171 children in 32 years
despite the ruler having a harem of 500 women , they worked out he could have produced his *enormous* family with between 65 and 110 women
