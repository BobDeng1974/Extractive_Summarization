by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 10:44 est , 12 november 2012 a gadget - loving father has built a device that lets him keep an eye on his children - wherever he is in the world			1
@entity7 , 35 , from @entity8 , uses a night - vision camera to watch his kids on a live internet feed on his tablet , smartphone or laptop			1
the webcam can be moved via remote control and has a speaker so that he or his wife @entity18 can read their kids a bed time story even when they 're out of town			2
i 've got my eye on you , sonny : @entity7 , with his wife @entity18 , daughter @entity29 , two , and baby @entity30 , six - months			1
the gadget - loving dad has built an app that allows him to keep an eye on his kids online mr @entity7 , a research manager at @entity35 , who has a two - year - old daughter called @entity29 and six - month old son called @entity30 , said that it cost him around Â£ 50 to put together the device			1
he first started the project in 2010 after finding similar devices already on the market had only limited features			1
' i can view it on my phone anywhere in the world if you have a mobile network connection			0
i was in @entity50 a couple of days ago , and i watched my son and daughter going to sleep , ' he said			0
' some people might think it 's a bit " @entity56 " but it 's more just to know they 're okay			0
' the webcam looks like a glowing eye			0
it could be a bit freaky but @entity29 does n't mind			0
it reassures her , she knows mummy and daddy are looking out for her			0
' mr @entity7 built his device out of products already readily available on the market , ' but ones that are n't actually designed to monitor babies with and thus do n't have crazy high price tags			1
' the system consists simply of an remote - controllable ip webcam with night - vision connected to his home @entity75 network			2
the camera transmits the feed via an internal web address that can be accessed using an internet browser or media software			0
night vision : views of the live feeds shown by mr @entity7 's device			1
he built it from commercially available ip camera gear , and saved a packet on the expensive , dedicated child - watching devices available mr @entity7 wrote on his blog : ' it is certainly a much cheaper and more flexible approach than the dedicated solutions on the market currently and rather than only being able to view the video feed on one tiny screen , you can view it on pretty much any screen you wish pretty much anywhere you want			1
he added : ' it 's not an alternative to a babysitter but it 's really useful if you 're away from home and you want to see your kids			0
i would definitely recommend it for other parents			0
' i think when i 'm not there it makes our children feel reassured			2
' the webcam has a speaker so that parents can read their kids a bed - time story - but it makes you sound like @entity119			2

@entity7 built the device after finding existing online baby monitors had only limited features
it *includes* night vision and a *microphone* to pick up sounds - as well as a speaker to read the children a *bedtime* story
