' you can be helping somebody by getting them a juice , or a glass of cold water , or whatever he wants because you know really he has very little chance to survive , and then less than an hour later he is dead , ' mr @entity8 told the @entity48			2
' then when you are putting his body in the bag , another one behind you has died			0
' @entity6 is passed onto humans from animals - especially fruit bats - and often breaks out near rainforests in central and western @entity20			0

however , @entity10 director general @entity197 said it was remarkable the outbreak had spread to several places and to a city of around two million people , @entity168			1

the outbreak of one of the world 's most lethal infectious diseases has alarmed a number of governments with weak health systems , prompting @entity233 to close its border with @entity7 and other neighbours to restrict travel and cross-border exchanges			2
