by @entity0 a schoolboy who beat leukaemia twice died after contracting a lung infection from dust caused by building work at @entity6			1

at an inquest today , the hospital was today criticised for failing to protect ‘ vulnerable ’ patients			2
@entity7 , nine , caught a fungal lung infection after breathing in dust from building work			1
the infection spread through his body , causing brain abscesses and eventually a haemorrage which killed him recording a narrative verdict coroner @entity23 said : ' he contracted the infection from building work which was being undertaken near to the ward and outpatients clinic , where he was being treated			1
' there was a failure to consult the department where patients were particularly at risk and a failure to undertake a risk assessment or act to minimise the risk			0
these failures contributed to @entity7 ’s death			2
' aspergillosis is a lung infection caused by spores from the aspergillus fungus			1
in a healthy person , the spores will be quickly destroyed by the immune system but in someone with weak lungs , or a compromised immune system - such as @entity7 - it can spread			2
symptoms can range from a cough , which is often occurs in asthma sufferers , to coughing up blood or even death			0
the most serious kind of @entity40 , which usually occurs in patients who have had chemotherapy , is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis			0
this infection can spread through the body to the heart , eyes , lungs and kidneys , where it becomes fatal			2
@entity7 's devastated family issued a statement after the hearing , saying : ' we are pleased with the narrative verdict which acknowledges that the @entity72 ’s failure contributed to @entity7 ’s death and that the @entity72 has taken action to improve the system for dealing with building work at the hospital			1
' we hope that the steps are far reaching and properly adhered to in order to prevent vulnerable immuno - compromised children from being treated in an unsafe environment in the future			0
' the inquest heard that the pupil from @entity86 primary school was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia in 2006 , and went into remission after being given chemotherapy treatment			1
but he suffered a relapse in december 2012 and in march last year underwent a bone marrow stem cell transplant using his older brother , @entity94 , as a donor			0
@entity7 suffered complications and went back to the hospital on a number of occasions in june and july after the building work had started at the @entity101			1
his mother @entity102 had said she had noticed dust in corridors but when she raised concerns had been reassured that there was no danger			0
dr @entity108 , a microbiologist at the hospital , said there had been no prior consultation with the oncology department about the works			0
he said that on a scale of one to 10 the seriousness of the failure to do this was 10			0
at an inquest today @entity6 ( pictured ) was criticised for failing to protect ' vulnerable ' patients and has pledged to take action to prevent more deaths @entity7 was found to have the life - threatening @entity40 lung infection following a chest x-ray and ct scan and was admitted to intensive care			1
but despite treatment he died on august 7			1
after the inquest a spokesperson from @entity6 said : ' everyone at the hospital is devastated by the death of @entity7			2
' when any child passes away at our hospital , we always examine their care to see if there is anything we could have done to prevent it			0
' in @entity7 ’s case , we recognise that there is a possibility that he could have been exposed to the aspergillus spores			0
' i totally understand why @entity7 ’s family feel that we let them down , but hope they can take some small comfort from the fact we have taken every step possible to learn from our involvement in @entity7 ’s care and his tragic death			0
