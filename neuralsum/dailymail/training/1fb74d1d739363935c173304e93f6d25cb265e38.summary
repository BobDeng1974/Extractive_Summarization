by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 16:44 est , 7 august 2013 the after - school activities being chosen by parents say a lot more than you might think about the future they envision for their daughters			1
when choosing activities for elementary school girls , families believe choosing either chess , dance or soccer puts their daughters on specific paths for future success , with each lending itself to traits prized by different segments of the population , according to a recent study			1
this finding was the result of interviews conducted with 38 families over a 16 - month period , the families were a subset of the over 200 families interviewed for the book playing to win : raising children in a @entity32			1
future executive : soccer is seen by upper - class parents as providing their daughters a path to the corner office in setting out to define how children ’s activities are associated with their feminine or masculine identity , author @entity41 interviewed 200 families on what after - school activities their children take part in and how parents feel that puts the wheels in motion for a more successful future			1
in post on the @entity55 ’s website , she chose to focus on the segment of families with elementary school - aged girls			2
@entity61 ’s findings , based on the girls ’ parents ’ own words , placed these young girls into three categories – ‘ aggressive , ’ ‘ graceful ’ and ‘ pink , ’ which she said defined the girls ’ ‘ gender scripts			2
’ she questioned the 38 families across three urban settings and three rural settings			0
aggressive girls , as defined by their parents , tended to be steered into soccer , according to @entity61			2
soccer moms tended to come from upper - class families with white collar jobs ranging from doctors to investment bankers and lawyers , @entity61 noted			1
‘ aggressive girls are taught to be both physically and competitively forceful , actively subsuming aspects of their femininity , ’ wrote @entity61			0
these girls are encouraged to de-emphasize physical femininity and cultivate a winning attitude – to prepare them for future executive positions			0
‘ i encourage her to be more aggressive because she 's a cute little girl , but i do n't like her to be a girly girl , ’ one father said to @entity61 , adding ‘ you know , i do n't want her to be a cheerleader -- nothing against that , but i want her to prepare to have the option , if she wants to be an executive in a company , that she can play on that turf			0
’ being overly feminine is seen as being a disadvantage by this parent , who worried his daughter would become a secretary if she was too much of a ‘ girly girl			0
’ give me an n ! give me an o ! : upper class parents feel that cheerleading , while okay , makes their daughters more likely to be an executive assistant than an executive , according to @entity41 grace and etiquette : young girls participating in competitive dance are more likely to be considered graceful and polite , which makes them moe desirable mates , according to their parents not nearly as focused on their daughters ’ careers as their more well - to - do counterparts , lower - class parents encouraged their girls to enrol in competitive dance – which specifically emphasizes feminine qualities such as grace and etiquette			1
dance competitions tend to have very supportive atmospheres , parents told @entity61			0
in addition to the focus placed on appearance – hair , makeup , cleanliness – the girls are encouraged to find at least one way to encourage or compliment their competitors			0
these situations prepare girls for futures in ways upper - class parents shun			1
grace and etiquette are equated with femininity , which blue collar parents tend to feel makes their daughters more desirable and likely to be married			2
marriage and family are seen as more important to lower - class families @entity61 spoke to , as opposed to the corner office often prized by the upper class			1
the one activity seen by parents to embrace both the competitive , warrior - like nature of soccer , and the femininity of competitive dance was scholastic chess			1
even more importantly some parents told @entity61 , ‘ they beat boys			0
’ pink warriors : young girls learn more about equality playing scholastic chess , they also even learn they can beat boys @entity167 , the female chess grandmaster , told @entity168 that chess not being physical is the point , that equality can be achieved in many ways			1
‘ i think girls need to understand that , yes , they have equal potential to boys			2
i think that chess is a wonderful tool as an intellectual activity , where girls can prove that unlike in physical sports , because by nature maybe boys are stronger or faster , in chess women can prove equal			1
’ these activities , @entity61 wrote , are symbolic of what parents want for their children			0
from maintaining upper - class social status to preparing one ’s self for being a good wife , after - school activities matter			1
‘ gender and class are being reproduced in these competitive activities , which will likely impact who ends up in that corner office and who ends up as the boss 's assistant , ’ @entity61 wrote			2
that is , unless you ’re the father of one boy beaten by a ‘ pink warrior			0
’ ‘ a chess mom described [ to @entity61 ] how a father reacted negatively when his son lost to her daughter : " the father came out and was shocked			0
he said , ' you let a girl beat you ! '			0
