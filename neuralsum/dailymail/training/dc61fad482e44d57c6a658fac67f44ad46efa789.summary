by @entity0 @entity2 tv personality @entity1 was so worried about looking silly on a gameshow that she decided to cheat but got caught before she could answer even one question			1
the blonde beauty , 29 who has appeared on the cover of the @entity2 edition of @entity9 , was supposed to identify well - known songs so downloaded the app @entity12 to her mobile and then hid the phone between her legs			1
as the first song played , she surreptitiously switched the phone on but did not bank on the app which can identify songs and singers within seconds sending her a text message causing the screen to light up			2
@entity1 ( left ) was so uncertain of her ability to name well songs she decided to cheat fingers on rather large buzzers : model and tv personality @entity1 , 29 , has to identify a song from 1974			1
is it @entity36 by @entity37 ? the show ’s host @entity38 spotted the giveaway light and asked @entity1 what was going on			0
the embarrassed @entity42 – who was voted 63rd sexiest woman in the world by @entity9 's readers – confessed all			0
‘ to be honest i think she deserves a special prize anyway because in seven years of organising this tv contest , nobody has ever done anything like this and certainly not quite as brazenly , ’ said @entity38			0
indeed some of the viewers posted comments online saying it had been one of the best and most fun episodes in the show ’s history			0
the idea of the show is to identify well - known songs and singers			2
@entity1 did not think she had what it took so decided to cheat not that kind of buzz : @entity68 reacts as the mobile between her legs vibrates to tell her that the app @entity12 has identified the song blonde moment : embarrassed @entity68 produces the phone that she had secreted between her legs , showing the @entity12 app ' ok i admit it ' : @entity2 tv personality and model @entity1 , 29 , confesses she was trying to cheat on the gameshow			1
