by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has been holding court for eight minutes , discussing how his dreams have been made real , when he makes a conscious decision			1
his £ 4m move from @entity7 to @entity8 has been one of the stories of the summer , given it provided an unexpected opportunity for him to return to where it all began ; the romance of a journey that began with heartbreak 17 years earlier coming full circle was there for all to see			1
@entity2 is beaming as he sits in a meeting room in the plush @entity21 , @entity8 ’s base here in @entity24 , talking about how he is settling in when , in a flash , his tone changes and he takes a pin to the nostalgia and sentiment that has surrounded him			1
‘ football has no place for sentimental things			2
it ’s about what i do on the pitch , it ’s as simple as that			2
‘ it ’s a good story and i ’m happy talking about it but the time has gone past that now			2
the first game of the season is coming and believe me when i say it that is all i am focusing on			1
i want to get myself in the best shape possible			2
i know when i am fully fit , that is when you will see the best of me			2
‘ there are more signings to come , which is great for the club , but there is already a great squad here			1
you see the depth and quality and with a couple more signings , we are only going to be stronger			0
’ his words are as timely as they are wise			0
while it is clear the emotion surrounding this transfer is far removed from the vast majority of other deals , @entity2 is smart to point out @entity33 did not sign him to be an on - field cheerleader - he was brought in to make a difference			1
laughter : @entity2 ( left ) is enjoying being back at the club who released him when he was 15 years old pride : @entity2 says it will be an honour to wear any strip with a @entity8 badge on it competitive : @entity2 challenges for the ball with @entity100 during @entity8 training in the @entity102 this , after all , will be a hectic season for @entity8 , one that sees them return to the @entity107 for the first time since 2009 , and expectation will abound after they came within two points of winning the @entity112 and @entity33 simply can not afford to carry passengers			1
determined characters like @entity2 are what he needs			1
those traits have been present ever since he was released by then academy director @entity117 in 1997 , enabling him to climb the football pyramid , from the days when he was working in a beetroot factory to subside his fledgling career			0
‘ i ’ll be honest - my career has been so long and been down so many different roads , i would be lying if i said that i had it in the back of my mind that i would ever return , ’ said @entity2 , who has played for , among others , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
' it was n’t a shock when i got released			0
i was n’t one of the better ones in my group ( @entity136 and @entity137 were peers )			0
i had only just been kept on six months earlier			0
i knew i was having to prove my place and keep working , so it did n’t really come as a surprise when they let me go			0
‘ when i look back , it was probably silly how much it hurt me because i was absolutely devastated			1
i was 15 and it felt like the @entity146			0
it was as simple as that			0
boss : @entity8 manager @entity33 brought in @entity2 to score goals for the club retired : @entity152 ( centre ) trains after ending his involvement with the @entity156 national team @entity157 : @entity158 trains with the @entity8 squad at @entity38 in @entity160 ‘ i ’m 32 so the days of just being happy when i ’m playing have gone			1
i ’m looking at the bigger picture			0
it ’s whatever is best for the club			1
of course i do n’t want to be on the bench and not play games but as long as i can see the manager appreciates me and my ability then i ’m happy to do whatever			2
‘ i did n’t ask for any number			0
i was happy to be given any number			0
it is a special number and i was made up when they said you ’re number 9			0
that [ points to @entity8 badge ] is what means the most to me			1
any number with that on , i ’ll be happy with it			0
’ with that , the beaming smile returns			0
@entity2 will take another step towards gaining full fitness when @entity8 face @entity31 in the early hours of thursday morning in @entity185 and there is no doubt the enthusiasm he has for the club will improve his chances of seamlessly fitting in			1
‘ my first reaction at the time ( when my agent rang ) was something along the lines of “ get lost ” , ’ said @entity2 , referring to the phone call that turned his world upside down in may			1
‘ i did n't believe him at first			0
when i got out of bed properly and listened i realised it was genuine			0
‘ but now i have to get picked , progress with the club and impress the manager			2
obviously when i look back over my career i ’ll never forget my time at all my clubs who mean a lot to me , but i ’m thinking i have to think about what i do from now			2
’ contemplating : @entity33 and @entity8 have a big seasonafter they finished second in the @entity112 @entity102 tour : @entity8 are in @entity102 on a pre-season trip to prepare for the upcoming season video new @entity8 signing eyes @entity112 trophy			1

@entity2 knows he was brought in by @entity33 to score goals
he says that him being a @entity48 had nothing to do with the move
@entity2 is at the club to help them on the field first and foremost
he says it was never in the back of his mind that he would return
@entity2 enjoyed a great season at @entity7 and signed for £ *4million*
he will play for @entity8 against @entity31 in the @entity102 on thursday morning
