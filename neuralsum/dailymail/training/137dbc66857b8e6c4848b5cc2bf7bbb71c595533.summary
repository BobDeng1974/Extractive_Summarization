@entity6 had worked at the @entity8 warehouse in @entity9 , @entity10 for three months when bosses gave him his marching orders - following a routine spot check			1

fired for wearing pants : @entity6 with the offending underwear that cost him his job at a @entity8 warehouse in @entity9 , @entity26 mr @entity6 had just finished his 2pm until 10pm shift when he was spot - checked and made to show his pants and socks to his supervisor			1
when they realised that @entity6 was wearing @entity4 boxer shorts he was asked not to return to the factory			1
the company claim when @entity6 was hired he agreed to the dress code			1
but @entity6 , of @entity36 , @entity26 , claims the contract did n't say he would face instant dismissal and he insist he is not the first person to have broken the rule			1
@entity6 believes bosses used the underpants incident as an excuse to get rid of him he said : ' i do n’t want people thinking i ’m a trouble causer , i just want to work , but i need to clear my name - i am not a thief			1
i know i should n’t have had the boxers on and ca n’t think why i did - you just do n’t think about it sometimes			2
it ’s really harsh saying i ca n’t return and their motives are questionable			0
' i was getting to the point where i would be getting a full contract with more employee rights and i think they ’ve got rid of me before that point			0
' they offer no uniform and it definitely did not say in my contract that i would be sacked , other people have been caught and they ’ve been let off with a warning			2
' i have n’t done anything wrong			0
it was an honest mistake other people have made in the warehouse			2
they treated me like i had stolen them until i emailed them a picture of the serial number but they treated me like a thief			2
' you can see the boxers are n’t new			0
you just put your boxer shorts on in the morning and go to work			0
' he added : ' i ’ve never even seen the boxer shorts being packed in the depot			0
i worked on shoes and handbags , sorting the boxes to be distributed out			2
” @entity6 got the @entity8 job through recruitment agency @entity86			1
in an attempt to clear his name he sent them a photo of his shorts label serial number to prove they had n’t been processed at the @entity95 distribution park depot			0
@entity6 recorded a phone call the day after his dismissal in which a @entity86 employee confirmed @entity8 do n’t want him to return			1

@entity86 have told @entity6 he can continue to operate for them elsewhere but not back at @entity8 in @entity9			2
pants : mr @entity6 has serial numbers that he claims prove his boxer shorts were shipped from a different warehouse ' with the serial number you can prove the boxers had n’t come through the @entity8 warehouse , ' said @entity6			1
' @entity4 will have all the serial numbers and release dates of those boxer shorts			0
' he added : “ the managers got on with me			0
i was a good worker and i worked hard			0
it seems a bit of a coincidence i was coming up to getting on a permanent contract			0
' @entity6 claims he knows of other @entity8 employees who ’ve been caught wearing @entity125 , but escaped with warnings			1
a @entity86 spokeswoman said : ' all of our employees working on the contract are made fully aware at start point of employment on the required dress code , and the consequences of not adhering to that policy			0
