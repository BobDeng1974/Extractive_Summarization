by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:36 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 03:36 est , 1 june 2013 @entity3 tourists have staged a @entity5 invasion , with record numbers flying in to the @entity5 in the last year			1
the influx of more than 100,000 visitors – up more than a quarter year - on - year - comes despite renewed tensions between the two countries over the status of the @entity12			1
attempts by @entity3 president @entity14 to stoke @entity16 feeling have failed to stop her compatriots from spending a record £ 104million during holidays and business trips in 2012			1
record : more than 100,000 visitors from @entity3 travelled to the @entity5 last year , spending more than £ 100million and staying for a total of 1.07million nights war of words : the rise in visitors to @entity5 comes despite attempts by @entity3 president @entity14 to lay claim to the @entity12 , which have been rebuffed by @entity30 president @entity14 was barred from the funeral of @entity33 last month after repeatedly laying claim to the @entity36 islands which @entity5 defended during her premiership in 1982			1
@entity30 has responded to the threats by refusing to rule out using force to respect the outcome of a referendum of islanders in which all but three voters said they wanted to remain a @entity5 overseas territory			0
but the war of words which has erupted after mrs @entity14 re-election as the country ’s president , only appears to have fuelled interest among @entity3 to holiday in the @entity5			1
in fact tourism bosses believe the influx of @entity3 football stars into the @entity5 @entity56 , including @entity58 ’s @entity57 and @entity60 ’s @entity59 , has also helped to stimulate interest in holidaying in @entity5			2
the number of visits from @entity3 rose in 2012 by 27 per cent to 103,500 , the highest year - on - year increase from anywhere in the world			1
visitor numbers were also more than five times higher than in 2002 , when just 19,000 arrived in the @entity5			0
and it was more than 25 times greater than the 4,000 visits made in 1983 , the year after @entity33 ’s government liberated the @entity12 , known to @entity3 as @entity12			1
increase : the rise in the number of visits from @entity3 was higher than from any other country , official figures show star attractions : interest in @entity5 has been fuelled by @entity3 footballers players in the @entity56 including @entity58 's @entity57 ( left ) and @entity60 's @entity59 , tourism bosses claim in 2012 , @entity3 stayed in the @entity5 for a total of 1.07million nights - an 84 per cent increase on 2011			1
visitors from @entity3 spent £ 101million , up from just £ 40million a year earlier			1
the visits included 22,000 more holidays in the @entity5 , 2,000 extra business trips , 1,000 visiting students but the number of trips to visit friends and family fell by 2,000			0
@entity91 , spokesman for tourism agency @entity92 , said : ‘ 2012 was a record year for visits and spend from @entity3 , up 28 per cent from the previous year and accounting for nearly one - fifth of all visits from @entity95 and @entity96			2
‘ we know that @entity5 ’s contemporary culture and rich heritage is highly regarded , while many younger @entity3 visitors see @entity101 as a vibrant city and the fashion centre of @entity104			2
‘ if you take a look around the @entity56 you ’ll also find some fantastic @entity3 players plying their trade , and with major events like the @entity110 taking place here , we hope we ’ll be able to give a warm welcome to an even greater number of @entity3 coming to experience the very best of what @entity5 has to offer			0
’ however , relations between the countries ’ two leaders has been far from warm			0
snub : last year mrs @entity14 tried to present mr @entity30 with a document laying claim to the @entity12 , but he refused to accept it at a @entity123 in @entity124 earlier this year president @entity14 used newspaper adverts to insist her nation was ‘ forcibly stripped ’ of the @entity12 in a ‘ blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism ’ – a claim branded ‘ crazy ’ by @entity132 officials			1
in an open letter to mr @entity30 , published as an advert in left - wing newspapers on the 180th anniversary of the alleged january 1833 takeover , she accused the @entity5 of defying @entity139 resolutions by refusing negotiations over the @entity12			2
but in a strong message which risked angering @entity142 , mr @entity30 made clear that he was ready to respond with force if threats to the islands emerged			0
he insisted that despite defence cuts , @entity5 would be able to defend the islands again , as @entity33 did in 1982 at a cost of more than 900 lives - 255 of them @entity5 servicemen			0
mrs @entity14 attempted to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country ’s claim to the @entity5 territory into mr @entity30 ’s hands in an encounter at a recent @entity123 summit			2
to her fury , the prime minister repeatedly refused to accept it , insisting she should respect the views of the islanders who want to remain @entity5			0
leader : the funeral of @entity33 was dominated by troops from units which fought to reclaim the @entity12 in 1982 history : steel helmets abandoned by @entity3 armed forces who surrendered at @entity172 to @entity174 troops during the @entity175 official tourism figures for 2012 showed record numbers of visitors from several countries , including @entity180 and record spend by @entity182 and @entity183			2
but the 27 per cent increase in visitors from @entity3 put it well ahead of other growth markets including @entity187 ( 24 per cent ) , @entity188 ( 23 per cent ) and @entity180 ( 20 per cent )			0
tourism minister @entity189 said : ‘ the tourism industry plays a key part in selling a modern , welcoming and dynamic @entity5 abroad that helps contribute to economic growth and drive investment			0
‘ we had a huge boost last year with the jubilee and hosting the @entity199 and @entity198 and the government remains committed to making sure we capitalise on it			0
