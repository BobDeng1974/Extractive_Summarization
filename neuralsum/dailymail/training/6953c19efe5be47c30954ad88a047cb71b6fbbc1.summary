ridesharing app @entity0 has copped a ferocious backlash after outraged @entity4 workers found prices had spiked dramatically in the wake of a terrifying hostage crisis in the city 's centre			1
the city has gone into lockdown after an armed gunman entered the @entity14 cafe in @entity15 , holding more than a dozen people at gunpoint and forcing some sobbing customers and workers to hold a black @entity20 flag in the store 's window			0
but as workers clamoured to leave the city 's @entity24 , many @entity0 users discovered the price of trips from the city 's @entity24 had more than doubled under the company 's ' surge pricing ' policy - or pricing during periods of high demand			1
' we are all concerned with events in @entity24 , ' the company said			1
' fares have increased to encourage more drivers to come online & pick up passengers in the area			1
' but commuters were n't buying it			0
' what a shameful disgrace , ' tweeted web developer @entity73			0
' how low can you go ? marketing fail is one thing , but lack of compassion is another , ' wrote @entity81			0
@entity82 reported an @entity0 trip to @entity84 under the ' surge pricing ' rule topped an extraordinary $ 145 this morning for one user , with a ' minimum $ 100 fare ' briefly listed			0
@entity89 witnessed a ride being offered from @entity91 , the city 's main artery , to the @entity84 cost $ 75 this afternoon			0
a reasonable taxi fare for such a trip would usually cost $ 45 and $ 55 and a typical trip with @entity0 's famously inexpensive app service would cost even less , according to @entity84			0
half an hour after their initial tweet - following a social media frenzy - @entity0 backed down			1
' @entity4 will be providing free rides out of the @entity24 to help @entity102 get home safely , ' the company said in a statement			1
heavily armed : police swarmed @entity4 's centre this afternoon ' our thoughts are with those affected and the @entity110			2
' we are in the process of refunding rides			2
' please note that surge pricing only remains in place to encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers from the area			2
' @entity119 premier @entity118 this afternoon urged @entity4 residents to commute home in the usual manner			2
' in terms of matters of transport in the city , can i ask everyone to go about in their usual manner - go about your usual exit from the city as you would , ' mr @entity118 told reporters			0
the hostage crisis has continued for more than five hours with little sign of abating .			1
