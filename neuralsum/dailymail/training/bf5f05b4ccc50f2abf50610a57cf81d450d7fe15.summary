government bureaucracy may lead to the deportation and stoning of an @entity4 woman seeking asylum in @entity6 , as she may be forced back to her home country where he husband has accused her of adultery			1
@entity10 denies her husband 's claims , but she fears she will not get a fair trial in @entity4 , and women convicted of adultery face death by stoning			1
now , because her estranged husband did n't officially file the adultery claim until after she made her initial asylum plea to @entity6 courts , the deadline for her to re-file is too soon to get the paperwork through			1
if the case keeps to the intended schedule , she will be forced to head back to @entity4 to face the adultery charges and the prospect of death			0
@entity27 , now 40 , was set up via arranged marriage with her allegedly abusive husband @entity29 in @entity4 in 1993			0
bureaucratic mistakes : @entity10 , 40 , and her son @entity31 , 16 , face trial in @entity4 because her estranged husband and his father claims she cheated on him they had a son , @entity31 , and moved to @entity38 three years later			1
facing fraud allegations in 2009 , her husband fled @entity38 and returned to @entity4			0
@entity27 flew with her son to @entity6 after her family in @entity4 told her that her husband had ' circulated information that i committed adultery '			2
@entity6 newspaper @entity46 reports that when @entity27 originally filed for asylum , her husband had n't officially registered his claims of adultery to the @entity4 court , so they had not filed any formal charges at that point			1
because there was no quantitative proof that she was being prosecuted in her country , her claim was rejected by @entity6 immigration officials			0
in @entity6 , there is a law that does not permit a refugee to reapply for a second review of their case until one year after they received the initial rejection			0
the paper reports that in many instances , the authorities have disregarded this ban and allowed the refugees in question to remain in the country until their year is up so that they can put new evidence forward in their case			0
but now , following a tightening of the laws on june 29 , @entity27 faces deportation in october even though she has new evidence since the @entity4 court has formally filed the adultery charges against her			2
' the fact that a removals officer can blithely tell me that he ca n’t wait to allow a risk assessment to be conducted based on the new evidence shows just how far ( @entity84 ) has drifted from @entity6 values , ' @entity27 's lawyer @entity79 told @entity46			0
being sent back : now the woman and her son have to leave @entity6 by the end of the week ' the average @entity6 would be horrified to know that we ’re going to send a woman to @entity4 to be stoned for adultery			1
' as it stands , immigration officials have rejected the lawyer 's request to push back her deportation date to late october and have said that @entity27 and her now - 16 - year - old son must leave the country by the end of the week			2
adding to the surprising decision , @entity6 formally suspended diplomatic relations with @entity4 two weeks ago , with foreign affairs minister @entity100 saying that the middle eastern country poses ' most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today ' .			2

woman fled to @entity6 from @entity4 when her husband claimed she cheated
she filed to stay in @entity6 under asylum , but they rejected her because her husband had n't reported the ' adultery ' to *criminal* court in @entity115
now he has , but she ca n't reapply to stay in @entity6 because the country does not allow *people* to submit two claims within the same year
she is being deported at the end of the week and will go on trial in @entity4
