disputing the conclusions of the @entity3 's independent watchdog , an independent board has asserted that @entity3 officers acted reasonably when they secretly searched @entity6 computers last year after learning that @entity6 aides had removed certain classified documents related to the torture investigation			1
the board , which was led by former @entity12 senator @entity11 , found fault with some of the findings by the @entity3 's inspector general , who said in july that five @entity3 employees ' improperly accessed ' a @entity6 portion of a shared computer network			1
the inspector general , @entity19 , resigned in december in what @entity3 officials insist is an unrelated development			1
@entity3 director @entity23 apologized after the release of the inspector general report and convened the accountability board			1
the @entity11 - led board said the five @entity3 employees did not deserve to be punished			1
the @entity28 released a report on the @entity3 's interrogation practices that said the @entity3 misled @entity31 and government policymakers about the effectiveness of the program that was secretly put into place after the 9/11 terror attacks – and the @entity3 was allegedly frightened enough about the outcome that it snooped on the committee 's computers aides to @entity12 senator from @entity43 @entity42 ( center ) took documents from a @entity47 @entity3 facility that they considered incriminating , and the @entity3 sought to find out where they were @entity3 director @entity23 ( center ) apologized after the release of the agency 's inspector general report and convened the accountability board which has now cleared everyone ' they acted reasonably under the complex and unprecedented circumstances involved in investigating a potential security breach in the highly classified shared computer network , ' the board said in a statement			1
the @entity3 accessed five emails of @entity6 aides , but the board concluded the access was a mistake and did not reflect malfeasance or bad faith			2
the board 's report amounted to a remarkable turnabout in a long running dispute between @entity43 @entity12 sen. @entity42 , the senior @entity72 on the @entity28 , and cia director @entity23 about whether @entity42 's aides acted appropriately when they removed @entity3 documents they deemed highly incriminating – documents the @entity3 considered an internal review to which the @entity6 was not entitled			1
the aides took the documents out of a @entity47 facility run by the @entity3 which had been set up to allow @entity6 investigators to review classified material			2
the documents were redacted and taken to the @entity6 's secure facility in the @entity84 building near the @entity85			0
they were not used in the @entity6 report on @entity3 interrogations , which was harshly critical of the agency			2
the documents , part of what is known as the ' @entity75 , ' were compiled by @entity3 officers who were sifting through the millions of pages being turned over to the @entity6 as part of the @entity6 investigation into the @entity3 's brutal treatment of @entity99 detainees after the 9 - 11 attacks			1
@entity42 said last year that the @entity102 review supported the @entity6 conclusions that @entity3 torture did not produce unique intelligence			1
and she said they were not consistent with the later @entity3 response , which disputed parts of the @entity6 report			2
in a statement wednesday , @entity42 said she continues to believe the ' @entity3 's actions constituted a violation of the constitutional separation of powers ' that led the @entity3 to make an erroneous referral for criminal charges against @entity6 staff to the @entity118			1
no charges were ever filed			0
' i 'm thankful that @entity121 has apologized for these actions , but i 'm disappointed that no one at the @entity3 will be held accountable			0
the decision was made to search committee computers , and someone should be found responsible for those actions , ' @entity42 said			0
a statement by the @entity3 simply restated the board 's conclusions			0
the documents in question were stored on a shared drive in the @entity47 facility			0
the system contained extremely sensitive documents , including the true names of covert operatives			0
@entity3 inspector general @entity19 resigned in december after clearing the agency 's employees , but the @entity3 insists his departure is unrelated @entity142 at the @entity144 detention centre in @entity145 is home to around 150 prisoners being held without trial on suspicion of terrorism ; the @entity6 's @entity3 torture report revealed tactics worse than the agency has previously admitted to according to the board 's report , a message flashed on the screen that said , ' your use of this system may be monitored and you have no expectation of privacy			1
' @entity42 has said that @entity6 aides accessed the @entity102 review using a @entity166 search tool , and printed it out and removed it because of its importance			0
after the @entity3 learned that @entity6 aides appeared to have taken the @entity75 without authorization , they began an investigation of the computer system to learn how the breach happened			0
there were no formal procedures governing how such a security check should be conducted , the board found			0
the @entity3 conducted three separate searches of the computer system , one of which involved ' inappropriate access to @entity6 work product , ' the board found			2
five @entity6 emails were accessed			0
but ' because there was no formal agreement – or even clear common understanding – governing the procedures to be followed in investigating a potential security incident in these circumstances , no course of action was free of potential complication or conflict , ' the board said in justifying the @entity3 actions .			0

@entity3 's inspector general resigned in december after blaming five @entity3 employees who ' improperly accessed ' computers in @entity6 offices
case points to a major *breakdown* in the separation of powers between *lawmakers* and an agency *overseen* by the @entity207
new board report says no one deserved to be punished and the @entity3 *personnel* ' acted reasonably '
@entity6 eventually released a *scathing* report about @entity3 torture *methods*
