by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has a point to make this season			1
it ’s about what he stands for and what matters to him : sport , not showbusiness			0
and it ’s about a hunger to reclaim lost status			0
the @entity14 full back will be eased into the new @entity15 season on friday night when he is among the @entity18 ’ replacements for the visit of @entity20			1
that is the upshot of a minor ankle injury which disrupted the final stages of his pre-season			0
yet once he does enter the fray , he will set about his personal mission with renewed purpose			0
goal : @entity14 full back @entity3 is determined to claim back the @entity33 no 15 jersey this season party : @entity3 ( right ) , who is married to @entity35 from @entity36 ( left ) , is often accused of focusing on showbiz @entity3 senses the doubts about his motivation , from those who matter and others who do n’t			1
there is a nagging perception in some quarters that , with his pop - star wife , @entity35 , and attendant celebrity profile , this is a player for whom the primary focus in life has shifted and the fires of career ambition have been partially doused			1
he is at pains to set the record straight			0
the 29 - year - old goes into the final season ahead of a home @entity56 with that looming target on his radar			1
work will come first and any sideshows in the long - lens gaze of the paparazzi will be kicked into touch for now			0
asked if the doubts about his hunger stem from the image of his lifestyle , @entity3 told @entity69 : ‘ you can understand why people think that			2
you can understand why @entity72 and the @entity33 coaches might think like that , too			2
‘ but i have always said that my rugby comes first			0
whatever comes with being married to @entity35 and all that jazz comes second			1
‘ i want to be known as @entity3 the rugby player rather than @entity3 , married to @entity35 from @entity36			1
it is very important to me that i have my own identity in that way , and i think that i deserve that as well			0
untrue : @entity3 ( right ) says that rugby ' comes first ' for him and ' all that ( showbiz ) jazz comes second ' glory : @entity3 ( centre ) with his wife @entity35 ( left ) and their daughter ( right ) holding the 2014 @entity15 trophy ‘ i ’ve been in this game a long time			1
i have 34 caps for @entity33 , i ’ve won a @entity15 title , i ’ve played in a @entity96 , i ’ve won @entity97 and @entity98			2
i ’ve scored in a @entity56 quarter - final , in a @entity15 final and in a @entity96 final , so my credentials speak for themselves			0
people sometimes forget all that			0
’ @entity3 concedes that his fervent desire to force his way back into the @entity33 team might not have been fully recognised , even by the coaches			1
he was a fixture in the @entity108 from 2010 until the summer of 2012 , before injuries and the rise of @entity111 and @entity112 knocked him from his perch			1
he intends to be more vocal in emphasising his wish to fight back			0
‘ i think @entity33 have been a bit miffed about why i have n’t been a bit more upset about being left out , ’ he said			2
‘ but to be brutally honest , i just did n’t feel fit and i felt that the other guys were playing better than me			0
‘ it ’s only now that i ’ve got this full pre-season under my belt that i feel like the @entity3 of old , so i will definitely have that conversation with @entity72 to tell him , “ i ’m still hungry for it and i will prove it ”			1
‘ it ’s probably going to be the last @entity56 i ’ll have a chance to be involved in so this is going to be such a big year for me			0
i want to push for that spot			0
@entity129 : @entity3 ( centre ) is renowned for his attacking running style and his ability to beat defenders from deep looking forward : @entity3 is determined that he will make the @entity33 squad for the @entity135 on home soil ‘ i had to force out @entity137 the first time to claim that no 15 shirt , when he ’d been playing very well			1
then i got injured , @entity111 came in and he played very well			2
‘ then when @entity112 got his opportunity , he came in and played very well , so i think we ’re all on a level playing field			2
‘ it will be a straight shoot - out now and will come down to who wants it more			0
’ four of @entity3 ’s last five starting @entity108 appearances for @entity33 have been on the wing - where resources are thinner than at full back			1
but despite some experts suggesting he makes a wide berth his objective , he wants to play for his country in his club position			0
‘ when you listen to the pundits like @entity158 or @entity159 , they ’re saying , “ @entity3 ’s future lies on the wing ” , ’ he said			1
‘ i think it ’s good that i can cover that position , but i see myself as an out - and - out full back			1
‘ i want to run out in the no 15 shirt for @entity33 again			2
whoever gets that shirt ahead of me , they ’re going to have to play their socks off to stop me nicking it back			2
’ try time : @entity3 is determined to reclaim his @entity174 15 spot back from @entity112 and @entity111 poised : @entity3 will return to action when @entity14 kick off their title defence against @entity20 on friday @entity14 v @entity20 is live on @entity177 from 7pm on friday			1
