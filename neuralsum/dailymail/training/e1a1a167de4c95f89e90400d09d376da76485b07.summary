' they 're breaking it down and dividing it up in the @entity11 , ' the aide told @entity24 , describing a frantic scene			0
' no one saw this coming			0
' the source requested anonymity since he is not authorized to speak publicly			0
@entity3 , the @entity4 's press secretary , opened wednesday 's press briefing by asking reporters , ' read any good books lately ? ' he said he had received a copy of the book tuesday night , a half - day after @entity36 published an excerpt online and portions were leaked to the @entity39 , the @entity40 and other press outlets			1
@entity3 downplayed the seismic event that gripped @entity43 on tuesday , saying he had n't read the book , titled , ' duty : memoirs of a secretary at war			2

' in a separate conversation , he added that ' this is very , very bad			0
but then , that 's his job			0
' @entity3 refused to directly defend president @entity13 on wednesday against charges that he lost faith in his own strategy for the war in @entity92 after he took office			1
now , however , ' the president has great faith in the troops that carried out the mission and in the mission itself , ' @entity3 said			0

@entity7 wrote that ' i never doubted @entity13 ’s support for the troops , only his support for their mission			1
' @entity3 cited only the first half of that sentence			0
photojournalists were allowed a rare opportunity wednesday to capture @entity13 and @entity115 together at lunch , in a move that @entity3 would not conceded was calculated to defend the vice president against @entity7 ' attacks @entity7 writes that @entity115 was ' wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades ' -- but the @entity4 rushed to the vp 's defense the former defense secretary wrote in his memoir , due out next week , that as @entity13 lost faith in gen. @entity128 ' handling of hostilities in @entity92 , he – gates – lost faith in @entity13 's commitment to accomplishing much of anything			1
former defense secretary @entity7 ' memoirs will go on sale january 14 , following a @entity137 offensive that ' blindsided ' the @entity4 ' as i sat there , ' he recalled , ' i thought : the president does n’t trust his commander , ca n’t stand [ president @entity143 ] @entity142 , does n’t believe in his own strategy and does n’t consider the war to be his			2
' ' for him , it ’s all about getting out			0
' and of @entity13 's surge of 30,000 troops in @entity92 , @entity7 said the commander - in - chief was ' skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail			1
' @entity3 insisted on wednesday that @entity7 ' recollections were evidence that the president welcomed a diversity of opinions among the consciously chosen ' team of rivals ' that made up his war council			2
@entity13 ' would not make a decision about surging @entity1 troops without a thorough debate , ' @entity3 insisted			2
' when it comes to the interagency process , ' he said , ' the president expects it to be robust , and he expects to hear competing points of view from every member of his national security team			2
' but he stopped short of declaring that @entity7 was incorrect in his assessment , even when reporters pressed him			0
the @entity4 was quick on tuesday night to defend vice president @entity115 against @entity7 ' charge that he ' has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades			1
' but while the administration 's statement , delivered via the @entity55 , called @entity115 ' one of the leading statesmen of his time , ' it did n't defend @entity13 directly			1
@entity13 , shown during a 2010 trip to @entity92 , doubted that his own troop surge in that country would meet with any success , @entity7 writes , but he ultimately decided to pull out of the country in order to help his re-election chances @entity3 refused to concede wednesday that a staged photo - op of the president and @entity115 sharing lunch was meant as a show of support for the vice president , who is among @entity194 touted as potential presidential candidates in 2016			1

' @entity3 also did not defend either president @entity13 or former secretary of state @entity73 against @entity7 ' bombshell revelation that both placed political calculations ahead of military strategy when they opposed president @entity212 's @entity211 troop surge before the 2008 presidential election season kicked off			1
describing a ' remarkable ' exchange he witnessed , @entity7 writes in a book due out next week that ' @entity73 told the president that her opposition to the [ 2007 ] surge in @entity211 had been political because she was facing him in the @entity220 primary			1
' @entity13 , too , ' conceded vaguely that [ his ] opposition to the @entity211 surge had been political , ' @entity7 recounts			1
' to hear the two of them making these admissions , and in front of me , was as surprising as it was dismaying			0
' @entity73 staked out her @entity211 policy in late 2006 not on a military calculation , but based on how she could aid her soon - to - come presidential campaign , according to @entity7 ' memoir gates ultimately concluded in his book that @entity13 was ' inexperienced ' yet ' determined to change course – and equally determined from day one to win re-election			1
' ' domestic political considerations would therefore be a factor , ' he wrote , ' though i believe never a decisive one , in virtually every major national security problem we tackled			1
' a publicist with @entity244 , which is publishing the memoir , told @entity24 that @entity36 paid for the rights to publish the excerpt from @entity7 ' book on tuesday , and hinted that more may be coming			2
