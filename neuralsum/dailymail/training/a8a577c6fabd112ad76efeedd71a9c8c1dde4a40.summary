the grandfather of @entity1 — the 19 - year - old girl who ' does n't exist ' — has told @entity3 how he dramatically rescued her from the clutches of her fundamentalist @entity6 parents			1
it happened on a regular wednesday visit for @entity9 to see his daughter 's family , he said in an exclusive interview at his home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
but since that day in september last year , @entity9 and his wife — also called @entity1 — have had no contact with their daughter and her family			1
' how could i not have done it ? ' @entity9 asked			1
' she is my granddaughter			2
her grandfather @entity9 said she was doing well in her new life @entity1 has gone public with her story this week , saying she ca n't get a job , board a plane , get a driver 's license , vote or do any number of everyday tasks that the rest of @entity37 takes for granted , because there is no public record of her existence			1
she was born at home in @entity15 and her birth was never registered			1
she was home - schooled and has never required hospital treatment , her grandfather confirmed			1
after a week - long standoff with her parents , her father , accountant @entity33 , has now agreed to try to help her get proper documentation to prove that she is who she says she is , @entity1 revealed on friday on her @entity66 page			1
@entity9 , 71 , said his granddaughter had texted him before he and his wife went to visit his daughter @entity69 , her husband and their nine children in @entity73 , @entity15 last year			1
' she said she was coming home with us			2
i texted her back saying she had to speak to her mother about that , ' he said			2
after the day - long visit on september 24 , @entity9 found @entity1 — the fourth of the @entity82 ' nine children — in his car with her belongings			1
' i told her she had to get out , ' he said			2
' she was 18 at the time and an adult , but i did n't want to be accused of kidnapping			0
' but she was adamant and said she wanted to leave with us			1
i said we should pray on it overnight , but she insisted she would n't get out			0
i told her she had to speak to her mother and my wife and i got out the car so they could talk it over			1
' but @entity69 failed to persuade her daughter to stay , said @entity9 , and she remained in the car			1
' eventually i told my son - in - law i had to take her , she is my grandchild and that is what she wanted			1
he said , ' fine , but you are not welcome back here again			0
' ' since that day i have not spoken to my daughter or to my other grandchildren			2
' however , he said @entity1 has kept in contact with her siblings with regular phone calls			1
@entity9 said @entity1 is doing fine in her new life and is helping a local family as a nanny until she can get proper documentation so she can get a real job			1
@entity1 's mother @entity111 ( left with @entity1 and her three sisters ) claims her daughter is misleading people he said that even before the day she left he could sense friction between @entity1 and her parents — whom he described as ' living off the grid			1
' @entity1 's story has gripped the public 's imagination since she revealed her plight on @entity66 and @entity39 , using the handle ' @entity122			1
' on @entity39 the teenager faces the camera and says calmly : ' my name is @entity127 and i am a @entity37 citizen by birth			2
' however , i was born at home , ' she continues			2
' and my parents neglected to file a birth certificate or birth record of any kind			1
they also never got me a social security number			1
' i was home - schooled my entire life so i have no school records			2
i have also never been to the hospital so i have no medical records			0
this leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship			0
' i am now 19 years old and i am unable to get a driver 's licence , get a job , go to college , get on a plane , get a bank account or vote			2
' she said she has contacted authorities who have no record of her birth and a judge in the county she was born had refused to issue a delayed birth certificate because she had insufficient proof of her identity			1
' but that 's all the proof i have , ' said @entity1			1
' i did n't pick this situation for myself , i just have to deal with the consequences and i do n't know how to fix it — i do n't know how to get out of this			0
' i want to travel , i want to get an education , i want to just be a functioning @entity37 , ' she adds in the 92 - second video , which her grandfather said he did not know she was making			2
' but i ca n't until i can prove citizenship			0
her mother @entity111 , 49 , runs a blog called the @entity173			2
she has posted her own version of @entity1 's leaving , but has often removed her stories within minutes			1
in one post , she said : ' on wednesday , september 24th my life was changed forever			0
my 18 year old daughter left home			2
she gave us no warning , no signs that it was coming			0
she did n't try to talk to us about it or work with us			0
she , with the help of my parents , just left			0
and with her she took pieces of my heart that had been torn to shreds			0
' in another she said @entity1 had been helped by ' a godless woman who has been giving her foolish counsel and encouraging her to deceive and get out			2
' she added : ' believe me , @entity33 and i are all too aware that we are not innocent in this			0
we played a part in this problem			0
' we made mistakes and we have apologized to her , genuinely repented and are asking the @entity198 to guide us through this			0
it feels impossible to think rationally so we have sought counsel from men who give us @entity202 to build us up			0
@entity1 is one of nine children ( above with their father ) , and left her home last september , with the help of her grandparents on her mother 's side ' we are taking each step carefully and trying to hold on to the one who knows us better than we know ourselves			1
i do n't want to paint myself as perfect here			0
i am as imperfect as i can imagine anyone being			0
' more recently she wrote how she and her family are ' pulling ourselves together ' following @entity1 's departure			1
' we have been making an effort to find our new normal without her			0
it has been really hard and we all miss her terribly , but i have learned a lot about how to deal with grief			0
' i definitely have days when i feel like i can hardly breathe and just cry for no reason			0
i know that 's part of the process			0
oh , those crazy stages of grief			0
' on friday @entity1 said on her @entity66 page that her father had now said he would help her prove she is who she says she is			2
' i have some wonderful news ! my father has begun cooperating with us ! he states he is willing to sign any documents , and give me any information he has concerning what i may need as proof			0
' she then asked her followers ' not to post demeaning comments about my parents			0
even though i do not agree with them on many things , i would like their reputation to be protected as much as possible			0
' she also revealed that she has found an attorney who is willing to help her and set out the steps she has already taken to prove her identity			0
among the documents she has managed to collect are a statement from a doctor who said he saw her when she was aged 9 , a 2005 statement of @entity255 from the @entity256 that does not give a date of birth , and a notarized document concerning the family 's change of their last name from @entity264 to @entity1 from 2014 .			1

@entity1 , 19 , claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school , taught instead by her mother
her parents did not get her a birth certificate or social security card , and now she can not become a citizen
her grandfather , @entity9 , told @entity3 how he and his wife visited his daughter 's family knowing there had been ' friction '
@entity1 got into their car and said she wanted to leave with them , he disclosed , adding : ' how could i not have done it ? she is my granddaughter . '
@entity1 's parents have posted their own version of events *online* saying they want to help their daughter and are *devastated* at losing touch with her
