by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 5 july 2012 @entity1 has been condemned by environmental groups and the international community after revealing plans to resume whale hunting for research purposes			1
the @entity8 nation has informed the @entity9 of its plans , after claiming it wants to resume whaling to help study the types and amount of fish whales eat			1
but critics believe these plans are a back - door effort to make the country only the fourth world nation to allow commercial whaling since an international ban came into force in 1986			1
@entity1 claims its whale hunting will also be for ' scientific purposes ' @entity1 officials said the whaling would be aimed only at studying the types and amounts of fish whales eat , as fishermen complain an increasing number of whales are consuming large amounts of fish stocks			1
the @entity9 gives member states sovereign rights to scientific whaling but @entity1 will still give up its whaling plans if the international organisation rejects them , officials said			1
various exceptions have allowed @entity27 , @entity47 and @entity48 to hunt whales anyway			1
indigenous groups in several countries also whale as allowed under international rules			0
@entity27 claims its hunts are for research purposes , though the meat from the killed whales mostly ends up in restaurants , stores and school lunches			2
the @entity9 moratorium on whaling introduced in 1986 permits lethal research on whales , with the meat then allowed to be used for consumption			2
this loophole is already widely used by @entity27			2
other loopholes in the ruling also allow @entity47 and @entity48 to hunt whales anyway			1
before the ban in 1986 , @entity1 claimed it caught about 600 whales a year , and that most of the meat was consumed			1
however , recent records have shown the @entity8 market for whale meat may not be as lucrative as officials thought			0
a 2006 survey found that 95 % of @entity27 people rarely or never eat whale meat			2
this comes despite campaigners claiming @entity27 whalers used 2.28million yen ( Â£ 19m/us $ 30m ) from its earthquake recovery fund to subsidise an @entity85 whale hunt last year			0
whaling is now subject to prosecution and punishable by a jail or fines , but meat is available from mostly minke that get caught in fishing nets ' by accident ' or wash ashore			0
@entity1 officials said they have not decided what to do with the whale meat following the studies			0
the leaders of @entity99 and @entity100 quickly condemned @entity1 's plans and said they would raise diplomatic protests			2
' we think it would be a terrible step in the wrong direction , ' @entity100 prime minister @entity103 said during a visit to @entity109			0
@entity99 prime minister @entity110 told a news conference that she was ' very disappointed ' at the @entity1 announcement			0
' we are completely opposed to whaling , there 's no excuse for scientific whaling , ' she said			0
' we believe this move is a thinly veiled attempt by @entity1 to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research , similar to hunts conducted by @entity27 in the @entity124 whale sanctuary , ' said @entity125 , head of global environmental group @entity127 's delegation to @entity9			1
speaking at an @entity9 meeting today in @entity130 , prime minister @entity110 added : ' we will make our voices heard today			0
' our ambassador will speak to counterparts in @entity1 at the highest levels of the @entity1 government and indicate @entity99 's opposition to this decision			0
' opposition : @entity99 prime minister @entity110 said her country would ' make their voices heard ' in opposing @entity1 's claim to whale hunting furious : activists attended the @entity9 meeting in @entity130 to demand a @entity148 whale sanctuary to protect the creatures @entity99 has filed a complaint against @entity27 at the @entity151 in the @entity152 to stop scientific whaling			1
a decision is expected in 2013 or later			0
@entity100 foreign minister @entity155 said the announcement was a setback to global conservation efforts as whales in its waters were already targeted by @entity27			0
' the portrayal of this initiative as a ' scientific ' program will have no more credibility than the so - called scientific program conducted by @entity27 , which has long been recognized as commercial whaling in drag , ' he said in a statement .			1

commercial whaling has been under international ban since 1986
@entity1 plans to resume whaling for ' scientific research '
critics claim research is only a front to allow commercial whaling
@entity27 , @entity47 and @entity48 are only other nations who continue whaling
