@entity130 attorney general @entity0 has written a letter supporting the judge who made a controversial call
@entity98 , great grandson of chemical baron @entity79 , was charged with fourth - degree rape of his young daughter but was *spared* jail
judge @entity10 said that @entity193 , 48 , ' would not fare well ' in prison
@entity0 has now said that she made the right decision because it would be difficult to find @entity193 *guilty* in trial because of the ' weakness ' of the case
shocking details about the offense and an alleged assault on his infant son have emerged in a lawsuit brought about by his ex-wife @entity58
@entity59 is an unemployed heir living off his *multi-million* *dollar* trust fund
