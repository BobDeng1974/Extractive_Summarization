@entity0 , 87 , suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘ cowering ’ in pain after falling from her bed			1

because she is mute , mrs rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened			0
it was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance			2
the injury occurred because one of her carers , @entity28 , had tried to turn her by herself – against the proper procedure at the private home			1
but when asked what had happened , @entity34 and her supervisor , @entity35 , lied , saying mrs rider had fallen out of bed			1

‘ she was then hoisted back into the bed			0
