@entity0 said she now fears for her life after learning the murderer is due to be released the widow subjected to a vile hate campaign at the hands of triple killer @entity6 last night told how she was ‘ terrified ’ that he was to be released next week			1
@entity0 , 71 , said nobody had told her about the release of the career criminal – who has threatened to kill her and her husband – and she learned about it only because the story was published in the newspapers			1
she said the decision had left her in fear for her life , and she attacked the @entity19 for their decision , saying @entity6 is a ‘ sick man ’ incapable of remorse			1
‘ i ’m absolutely terrified at the thought of @entity6 being released , ’ said mrs @entity0 , who runs a sanctuary for around 100 animals			1
‘ i ’m frightened he will send someone to kill me			0
’ she added : ‘ he should n’t be afforded any human rights for what he ’s done			0
what about the human rights of the police officers and people he has killed ? ’ five years ago @entity6 ’s bid to be released from jail was rejected after it emerged he had terrorised mrs @entity0 and her family after she complained about his behaviour while working on day release in her animal sanctuary in the @entity41			1
their evidence meant the @entity19 deemed him too dangerous to be back on the streets			0
mrs @entity0 told how she and her late husband , @entity45 , who died of a heart attack eight years ago aged 68 , had been forced to give evidence by the police and prison authorities			1
despite being assured that they would be protected , documents detailing their statements were leaked to @entity6 and sent to him in his prison cell			1
it was this blunder by the authorities that allowed him to carry out his campaign of harassment which has made their lives a misery			0
under the noses of prison guards , he rang her from jail up to five times a week			1
and there was a series of sickening attacks on her animals			2
mrs @entity0 broke down in tears as she recounted how one of her horses was hacked to death and almost decapitated in an axe attack the night before @entity6 ’s parole hearing in november 2005			1
in other assaults between 2002 and 2006 , a horse lost an eye after being battered with an iron bar ; a donkey died after its pelvis was shattered , probably with a baseball bat ; the family ’s pet cat was electrocuted ; and a peacock was strangled			0
mrs @entity0 was not invited to give evidence to the latest @entity19 hearing			2
incredibly she learned of his impending release from a local councillor who knocked on her door on thursday following media reports about his release			2
‘ i nearly collapsed , ’ she said			0
‘ we were assured he would never come out , so i was shocked			0
’ @entity6 was jailed in 1966 after shooting dead two policemen and another person			1
the criminal was allowed to work at the animal sanctuary on day release from 2001 until a complaint into his behaviour was made			1
he is pictured ( right ) in 2009 it was confirmed this week that @entity6 , 78 , is to be freed from prison after spending 48 years behind bars for the cold blooded murder of two policemen and another person in @entity112 in 1966			1
he is expected to be released from @entity113 in @entity114 next week			2
the @entity115 has learned he is likely to use a false name and will be initially assessed at a probation hostel			0
then he is expected to be transferred to a warden - controlled hostel			2
he will be entitled to a state pension and housing benefit			0
news of his impending release has been condemned by relatives of his murder victims , police leaders and senior politicians , who say he should die in prison			2
the murderer was sitting with two accomplices in his van near @entity133 prison in @entity112 preparing for an armed robbery when he opened fire on twounarmed officers			0
detective sergeant @entity137 , 30 , detective constable @entity137 , 25 , and constable @entity137 , 41 , were killed in the attack on august 12 , 1966			2
the case shocked the nation , and @entity6 would have hanged for it – but the death penalty had been abolished the year before			1
but by 2001 he was working on day release from an open prison at the animal sanctuary			1
the job was supposed to be a prelude to his release the following year			2
‘ no - one ever told us who he was , to us he was just another worker , ’ mrs @entity0 added			1
‘ nobody told us about his criminal past or that he was one of the country ’s most notorious murderers			0
’ now , knowing he is about to be released , she says she is unable to sleep and is constantly in fear of attack			0
‘ my life has been ruined , i ’ve had no life for the last 15 years , ’ she added			0
police constable @entity162 ( right ) and temporary detective constable @entity163 ( left ) were killed in the attack detective sergeant @entity165 was also murdered by @entity6 in 1966 when he shot them dead ‘ i ’m constantly looking over my shoulder , every night when i lock up the animals i ’m wondering if they will still be there in the morning			1
‘ if the authorities had done their job properly then none of this would have happened			0
’ mrs @entity0 was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack on her horse and underwent counselling paid for by the @entity178 , but she still breaks down when discussing what happened to her animals			1
today her home is protected by £ 65,000 of state - of - the - art cctv and security			0
up until two years ago she also had police panic alarms – with a direct line to armed response units – installed in her property			0
now she is hoping they will be re-installed should @entity6 be freed , although she is not convinced the police will be able to protect her family			2
‘ he ’s a sick man who has done some dreadful things			0
he wo n’t show any remorse for what he ’s done – not in a million years			0
