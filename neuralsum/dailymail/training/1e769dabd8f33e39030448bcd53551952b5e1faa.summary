@entity2 farm in @entity3 , @entity0 has welcomed an unlikely guest , a long - haired creature from almost 5,000 miles away called the @entity7 yak			1
the mammoth - like beast , which is normally found in the chilly climates of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , weighs half a tonne			0
the width between the tip of the left horn and the tip of the right horn is 4ft			0
unlike traditional cows , the yak does not make a ' mooing ' sound and instead makes a grunting noise similar to that of a pig			1
a year and a half ago , @entity25 and @entity26 became the first people to breed the yak in the @entity29			1
holy yak : this fierce looking bovid weighs half a tonne			0
the breed originates from been the @entity7 and the animals normally live in freezing temperatures on the @entity37 plateau the yak , pictured here with one of its calves , can survive in temperatures as low as - 40 degrees			1
the animals have wide horns and are nimble on their feet @entity25 and @entity45 own a 200 acre farm in @entity3 , @entity0			1
vet mrs @entity47 completed a diploma in @entity50 reproduction at the @entity51 after her first veterinary degree after researching yaks for 18 months , the couple imported the bull and three female yaks from @entity57 and @entity58			0
they have already produced two pure - bred calves , by impregnating traditional holstein cows and hope to produce another bull			1
their yaks are covered in a mass of thick , wiry hair to keep them warm in their native climates and have enormous horns to help shovel thick snow			0
wild yaks - @entity71 grunniens in @entity73 - can grow up to seven feet tall and weigh up to a tonne			0
and a yak could soon be coming to a village near you because the couple has since sold the bull 's semen to some six farmers			1
in a few months when their new herd is ready , @entity82 and mrs @entity47 will be visiting local gastropubs and farmers market to promote the meat - said to be incredibly lean and low in cholesterol and saturated fat			1
@entity90 has long been eaten in countries such as @entity92 and @entity10			0
yak milk and butter is also used as an alternative to traditional milk and butter			2
the hair is used to make blankets and clothes and is even used in the @entity29 for wigs worn in theatrical performances			2
the meat is already popular in @entity104 , with yak burgers , yak stew and yak roast on restaurant menus			2
health benefits of yak can be compared to chicken but the taste is similar to traditional beef			2
the yaks eat the same food as traditional cows and have similar temperaments			2
but their fur is much longer and they have horns measuring 4ft from the extremity of the left horn to the end of the right yaks also produce healthier milk than traditional cows - and at a faster pace			2
a yak fetus develops at a quicker speed than a tradition cow , bringing the gestation period down from nine months to eight			0
this means the process of impregnating the cow again is greatly sped up , meaning they can produce more milk			0
mrs @entity47 , a 38 - year - old vet , said : ' many farmers i work with own dairy farms and they practise block calving , where they get all their cows pregnant at the same time			2
mr and mrs @entity47 have imported the first yak into the @entity29			1
the hope that the trend will catch on @entity148 : the half yaks are new additions to the herd at @entity152 in @entity3 , @entity0 ' this is normally done in the spring time because there is a lot of green grass available for them to feed on , so it is economical for farmers and nutritional for the cows			1
' cows have a gestational period of nine months and it would be ideal for a cow to have a calf once a year but that gives them just three months to recover			0
' i heard that other countries were breeding their cows with yaks because yak bulls have a gestational period of just eight months			2
yak meat is currently not in common usage in the @entity29 but it is already popular in @entity104			1
countries such as @entity92 and @entity10 use the animal 's milk to create an alternative cheese and butter			0
but pure - bred yaks can only produce enough milk for their calves so the yak needs to be crossed with a traditional cow			1
although the taste of the meat is similar to beef , its health benefits are equivalent to chicken			0
recipes containing yak meat can include : @entity197 's pie , @entity90 stew and @entity90 chilli			1
although the meat is healthier than regular meat yak milk is higher in fat than traditional milk ' it gives the cows longer to recover and more of an opportunity for them to become pregnant again			1
' the vet said her fascination with the animals began when she did some research and discovered that yaks had been bred for thousands of years in the @entity7			1
she said : ' families would have originally had a yak as their house cow to be used for things like milk and butter			0
' pure - bred yaks only produce enough milk for their calves however , so they started crossing them with cows			0
this resulted in a hybrid that produced enough for the family			0
' not only does breeding cows with yaks make the gestational period shorter but the meat itself is very lean and low in cholesterol			0
' the female yak is smaller than its male counterpart but has all of the same features - including its horns @entity0 is almost five thousand miles from @entity10 - the traditional home of the yak			1
yaks are found in the @entity7 and as far as @entity12 and @entity11			2
despite their fierce appearance , the majority of yaks are domesticated animals			0

@entity29 's first yak has been imported by @entity0 farmers @entity25 and @entity26
animal is normally found almost 5,000 miles away in the @entity7
they bred the yak with traditional @entity254 cows and created the **yow**
plan to begin selling healthy **yow** meat to pubs in the local area
will begin selling yak semen to fellow @entity29 farmers
