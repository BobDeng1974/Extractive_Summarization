the @entity0 could have five teams in the next season 's @entity2 after @entity4 confirmed the top four and @entity7 winner will qualify for @entity4 's elite competition			1
there was a suggestion the entry for the @entity2 from @entity12 would be reduced to the top three and @entity7 winner - making four - if @entity15 or @entity16 won the competition			1
but @entity4 have told @entity18 they will allow five teams to enter the @entity2 if @entity20 or @entity22 's side are victorious			0
@entity16 will gain entry to the @entity2 next season should they win the @entity7 this term spurs will be keen to finish in the top four but have been given an extra route into the @entity2 @entity27 celebrate winning the @entity2 in 2012 , which denied @entity15 a @entity2 place @entity29 on the final day against @entity30 in 2012 - @entity15 finished fourth but missed out on @entity2 having each finished in the top four in the last decade , both @entity16 and @entity15 missed out after rival teams who failed to qualify via the @entity0 went on to win the @entity2			1
in may a @entity4 statement read : ' the @entity7 winners could gain direct access to the group stage , should the @entity2 title - holders also qualify via their domestic league , thus freeing up a place in the @entity2 group stage			2
' @entity16 , who had previously been tipped for relegation , enjoyed an incredible season to finish fourth in 2005 only for @entity46 rivals @entity45 to beat @entity47 on penalties in the @entity2 after a stunning comeback from three goals down			0
@entity4 decided that @entity45 , as winners , should not be denied a place in the competition and so both teams played in the following season 's qualifying rounds			0
@entity16 , who had been tipped for relegation , finished in the top four after a stunning 2004/05 campaign however , despite finishing fith , @entity45 won the @entity2 and so both @entity46 team gained entry into the following season 's competition @entity16 's @entity63 celebrates only for his goal against @entity65 to be ruled out by @entity66 while the @entity68 were eventually knocked out in the last 16 by @entity70 giants @entity67 , @entity16 were unlucky to be beaten by @entity65 in the third qualifying round after @entity72 referee @entity66 ruled out a @entity63 header as the @entity74 went on to win 4 - 2 on aggregate before making it to the semi-finals			1
meanwhile , in 2012 , @entity15 were excluded from the @entity2 , despite finishing fourth , because of @entity27 's triumph in the competition			0
unlike the @entity16 , the north @entity81 club went straight into the @entity7 rather than being given entry to the @entity2 qualifying rounds			0
after past disappointments , @entity16 and @entity15 will be desperate to take advantage of @entity4 's recent ruling and make certain of their place on @entity4 's top table .			2

@entity7 winners will gain entry to @entity2
if @entity15 or @entity16 win the @entity7 , the @entity0 will have five *representatives* in @entity4 's elite competition
it was suggested that the top three and @entity7 winner would qualify - making four - but @entity4 have confirmed this will not be the case
@entity15 have missed out when finishing in top four as @entity27 won the @entity2
@entity7 final is in @entity103
