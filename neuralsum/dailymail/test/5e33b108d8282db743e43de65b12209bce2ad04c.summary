the traditional cookie cutter wedding no longer exists - new reports suggest brits are ditching tradition in favour of alternative practices when it comes to getting hitched			0
two of the biggest changes are the fact that religious services have fallen out of favour and that brides are opting for bold colour schemes for their big day			2
a new study , which has tracked the decisions of brides and grooms over the past five years interviewed 1,893 newlyweds and compared them to answers they have collated since 2010			1
when it comes to honeymooning 18 per cent of us are now choosing to holiday in the @entity24 compared to 8 per cent five years ago the study showed that couples are shunning religious ceremonies when it comes to their big day with services falling from 40 per cent to 35 in the past five years			1
registry offices have seen an increase in bookings by two thirds , going from three per cent to nine per cent since 2010 , and 50 per cent of bride and grooms have opted for some form of civil ceremony when getting hitched			0
tradition seems to be out of the window when it comes to paying the bill			0
in 2014 , just seven per cent of @entity24 couples allowed the bride 's parents to pay the entire bill , down from nine per cent in 2010 , while over a third of married couples in the @entity24 ( 31.4 per cent ) covered their entire wedding bill themselves			1
the trend for cupcakes is falling out of favour sinking from appearing at 15 per cent of weddings to just 10 per cent , however cheese towers are on the up by three per cent since 2011 the study by hitched.co.uk also showed that spending on weddings as a whole is increasing , up by 3.4 per cent year on year , outpacing the economic growth of 2.8 per cent			0
the average cost of a wedding is now £ 16,020 ( compared to £ 15,494.54 in 2013 )			0
forking out for our own weddings seems to be having a knock on effect as lavish honeymoons are less popular than they once were			0
newlyweds are now choosing to honeymoon closer to home , with 18 per cent opting for a vacation in the @entity24 , compared to eight per cent just five years ago			1
32 per cent choose @entity72 , an increase of 11 per cent in five years , while honeymoon visits to the rest of the world has plummeted from 71 per cent to 50			1
it seems that many are also less keen to jet off immediately , with just 39 per cent of us going on our honeymoon within two days of the wedding , compared to 47 per cent in 2010			2
@entity84 bridesmaid dresses are out as the favoured colour scheme for a wedding is now purple it 's good news for bridesmaids though - peach is no longer the colour scheme of choice for dresses			2
purple is now the most popular colour in the @entity24 ( 19 per cent ) , followed by blue ( 18 per cent )			1
another favourite that has fallen out of favour is cupcakes - in 2011 , 15 per cent of weddings opted for them as an alternative to a traditional wedding cake , but they are now chosen by just 10 per cent of couples for their reception			1
this does n't mean you will necessarily have to choke back some heavily iced fruit cake though , as five per cent of couples now have a cake made of cheese , up from two per cent in 2010			2
@entity112 , editor of hitched.co.uk says that our changing attitudes towards weddings are seeing new traditions created			0
she said : ' as well as a snapshot of trends that might come and go we can see some longer term patterns emerging , with the decline of the religious ceremony and the expectation that parents would foot the bill			0
' couples seem more keen to foot the bill for drinks , but at the same time they are still under financial pressure , so other things need to give like the lavish honeymoon with more couples honeymooning in the @entity24 or @entity72 or taking longer to save			1
