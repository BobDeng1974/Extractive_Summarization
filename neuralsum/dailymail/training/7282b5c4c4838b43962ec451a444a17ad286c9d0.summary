by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has backed @entity3 to succeed @entity4 as the next @entity6 manager , but does n't believe the @entity8 boss will be leaving his post any time soon			1
in an interview with @entity11 , @entity2 spoke about @entity6 's @entity13 failure , and how they can go forward from it			1
but he also does n't believe that @entity4 will leave the job ' in a million years			1
' when called upon to name who he thought should be @entity6 's next manager , the former @entity17 and @entity18 boss felt that the @entity22 need look no further than @entity23			2
they wont leave , but [ the @entity22 should ] give somebody like that a five - year contract and say " go with the kids "			0
' he ( @entity3 ) changed @entity8 around			1
he went in there and knew how they wanted to play straight away , got @entity42 out and got them playing			0
' and on the international scene it 's got to be like that			0
' his major problem is if @entity48 is now swallowed up by @entity49 or @entity50 , because if he is , @entity8 will not be anywhere near the same team			1
' like with @entity54 , when they want somebody they go out and get them			0
if i was @entity3 i 'd be more concerned than i was last summer			1
' tough to take : @entity59 ( centre ) and @entity61 ( right ) look dejected after losing to @entity62 safe : @entity4 's position as manager i secure , according to @entity22 chairman @entity67 @entity2 also believes that @entity3 will be ' delighted ' if his captain @entity61 calls time on his international career			1
' the temptation will be to break the ( @entity6 cap ) record , but he has done the right thing to sleep on it			0
' he 's had a hell of bad a season at the end with the mistake against @entity78 , emotionally he 's never recovered from that , and you could tell from his play at the @entity13			0
' @entity2 also mentioned @entity31 as a possible contender for the @entity6 job , following his successes with @entity32 over the past couple of seasons			1
' he has taken @entity87 and made him into a player , the kind of player you need at the @entity13 , even though i 'm not a fan of his			0
' pointing the way : @entity2 believes @entity6 should look to youth in both playing and management roles and when pressed about current incumbent @entity4 's position with the national side , @entity2 added : ' i do n't think @entity4 will ( leave ) in a million years			1
because he 's not going to get another chance like this			0
' if they lose to @entity102 i dont think they 'll blame him			0
i 'd be surprised if he does n't play @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 , so if he does lose it will just be a case of " i wanted to give the kids a game "			2
' i do n't think ( defeat ) will change anything			2
i just do n't think ( @entity67 ) @entity67 should have come out after two games and say something he did n't need to say			2
' i think he just wanted to support him , to lose both games it 's terrible			0
' he 's trying to be clever , but it did n't warrant that , he could leave it until after ( the @entity13 ) , but there 's got to be some sort of inquest into the situation			2

@entity3 backed to succeed @entity4 by @entity2
but @entity2 believes @entity3 is unlikely to quit as @entity8 manager
@entity27 and @entity31 should also be considered , he says
@entity2 does n't believe @entity4 will resign ' in a million years '
