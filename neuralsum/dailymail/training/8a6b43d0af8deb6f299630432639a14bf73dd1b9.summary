@entity2 was launched in @entity7 just two weeks ago and has already overtaken @entity13 and @entity6 to become the country 's most - downloaded app. its women - only network piggybacks on @entity6 to allow users to rate their male friends on their character , appearance and sexual performance			1

after finding out he scored 7.7 out of 10 on app , he has decided to sue its creators , claiming that allowing anonymous and disparaging comments about a person is unconstitutional under @entity7 law			1
mr @entity23 told @entity36 : ' i was disgusted because i did n't authorise my details to be used by this app. i have a girlfriend and she learned about it because a mutual friend sent it to us			0
' she was annoyed because she did n't like seeing this kind of thing written about me			0
' available as a mobile app for @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity2 describes itself as ' a private network for girls to express and share their opinions openly and honestly '			2
it syncs with users ' @entity6 profiles to allow them to anonymously rate the sense of humour , manners , ambition , commitment level and appearance of their male friends on the social network by answering multiple - choice questions			1
' we created @entity2 to unleash the value of girl talk and to empower girls to make smarter decisions on topics ranging from relationships to beauty and health , ' its creators boast on the app 's website			1
but mr @entity23 , who is a legal academic , feels differently about the software			0
' it 's a question of privacy on the internet , ' he sad			0
' i want to see the app no longer allowing people to comment anonymously and @entity6 no longer giving personal details to any app. ' some @entity7 commentators have likened @entity2 to mere bar gossip , a comparison rubbished by mr @entity23 in a statement he released to journalists			1
' a conversation in a bar is to @entity2 as a bottle of water is to the ocean , ' he said , adding that the app 's impact must be seen in terms of ' undue exposure , range and potential harm			1

it is available at company.onlulu.com / deactivate			0
' the tool allows guys to ensure that they do not appear on the @entity2 app and blocks them from being reviewed by their female friends			1
interestingly , one - third of guys who use the removal tool reactivate themselves within a week			0
' the @entity2 app is not available in the @entity125 or @entity126 but we receive requests daily from women who want to be able to use @entity2 , like the millions of women elsewhere			2
' @entity2 's chairman , @entity131 , denied that the app violated @entity7 law			1
