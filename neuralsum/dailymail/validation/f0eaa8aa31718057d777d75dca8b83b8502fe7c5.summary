@entity0 fears @entity2 ’s season - ending injury may also rule the star centre out of @entity6 ’s @entity5 campaign			1
the @entity7 back suffered a major blow ahead of saturday 's @entity10 clash at @entity11 when he damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during thursday morning ’s training session			1
the @entity15 confirmed that he is ‘ out for the rest of the season ’ but , speaking before the result of scans on @entity2 ’s freak injury were released , @entity0 said @entity22 damage could mean up to six months on the sidelines and remove the 24 - year - old from his @entity5 plans			1
@entity2 faces a race against time to be fit for the @entity5 after injuring his knee at training @entity6 coach @entity0 fears @entity2 may not recover in time for the @entity5 , starting in september how @entity29 and @entity6 will line up for saturday 's @entity31 clash visibly shaken by an incident that happened just a few hours before the team flew to @entity34 , @entity0 now hopes his squad will be galvanised in the face of fresh adversity for saturday 's @entity31 clash			1
explaining that @entity2 had been a key figure in his starting xv , @entity0 said : ‘ we had named @entity2 to start at centre but he has perhaps done his acl this morning			1
‘ @entity2 did it on his own			1
a change of direction and his knee went out from underneath him			1
if it ’s the @entity22 , that would be the @entity5 as well			1
‘ we ’ll miss him in attack and defence			2
he ’s one of our best line breakers and has been playing very well up to now			2
‘ he is with some competent surgeons at the moment , he ’s getting scanned			2
he ’s understandably very upset about it			2
‘ we ’ve seen guys come back from an acl before , so it ’s just about when we get him back			2
but , if it ’s the @entity22 , he ’ll be six months			2
‘ he was getting tested this morning			2
i went to see him during a break in training and he ’s been whisked off with the pros			0
i will obviously talk to him again			0
’ @entity2 , here showing his disappointment after @entity6 's loss to @entity64 , awaits results of scans on his knee @entity67 has now taken @entity2 ’s slot for the @entity29 game			1
‘ it ’s an opportunity for @entity67 , who was initially named on the bench , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ you saw his two tries for @entity74 last weekend , he is ready to step up			0
we ’ve got an able replacement who has played well recently			0
‘ we would dearly love to have @entity2 starting and then have someone like @entity67 come in and keep pace , bring physical intensity and presence to the game			1
but @entity67 has stepped straight in , and it means we ’ll have to juggle the bench if we get injuries			0
‘ i think it has tightened the group up – and that will be important when we play this weekend			0
we are playing what is probably one of the best teams in the world as they are preparing for the @entity5			0
the group adapts and moves on			0
’ coach @entity0 said the 24 - year - old centre had played a key role in the @entity6 xv @entity2 ’s withdrawal is one of five changes @entity0 has made to his starting xv			1
along with @entity67 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 all come in for their first starts of this @entity10 , while @entity106 returns after serving his ban			1
@entity67 ’s promotion sees @entity110 move on to a bench that boasts six forwards to only two backs – although no. 8 @entity114 has been told to prepare for playing a part in either unit			0
@entity0 revealed : ‘ @entity114 is a midfield replacement , emergency cover			0
he knows he could be marking ( @entity29 centre ) @entity120 or he could be marking ( @entity121 ) @entity122			1
‘ i know he ’s got a good boot on him			0
we know he ’s a very skilful player			0
we want to have some physical density and some experience at the end of this match			0
‘ so he and @entity130 , who has come back and has aggressive defence and is good on the ball , are there to put pressure on @entity29			1
we want to stay close and finish this game with strength and experience			0
