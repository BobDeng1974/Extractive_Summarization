@entity0 has claimed @entity1 was never destined to be an all - time great			1
the @entity3 striker has struggled to reproduce his best form for both club and country recently with opinion divided over his best position			0
and @entity0 believes the 28 - year - old 's best days are behind him			1
' we ’ve seen a lot of great things from him over a long period			0
there ’s no question he ’s a terrific player			0
' [ but ] he ’s not gone on to become a @entity11 or @entity21			2
realistically , he was never going to be one of the all - time great players			1
' at the same time , he ’s one of the best @entity46 players we ’ve had , there ’s no doubt about that			1
' whether we ’ll see something better from him in the future is unlikely			0
statistically , your prime years are between 22 to 28 - years - old , after that you gradually peter out			0
' @entity0 , seen here with @entity58 at @entity59 , believes @entity1 is past his peak			2

@entity0 claims @entity3 and @entity62 striker @entity1 has not lived up his early promise

although he believes his best days are behind him
