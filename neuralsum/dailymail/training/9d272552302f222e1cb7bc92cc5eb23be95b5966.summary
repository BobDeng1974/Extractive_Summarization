by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 25 october 2013 ' i 'm bored ! ' is a whinge many parents may hear this half term unless their offspring is glued to an @entity5 or tv screen			1
but as more studies have proved this week how children 's health and academic performance can improve if they exercise , a sedentary break from school could do them more harm than good			1
the @entity30 brothers say there are many easy and affordable ways to get your children moving whilst still having fun			1
@entity24 , 23 , told @entity36 : ' active can involve anything			2
there are so many different ways to get your kids moving - you could build dens , play pooh sticks , make an assault course or create a treasure hunt			2
it does n't have to have too much structure			2
' his older brother @entity25 , 25 , added : ' our parents were fantastic at giving us things to do and showing us how to make fun for ourselves and just enjoying being outside and active			1
' on your marks : the brothers have grown up competing against one another and love being sporty the brothers love of being outdoors , running , cycling , swimming - and generally trying to be better than the other at whatever game they played - led to them becoming professional triathletes who took gold ( @entity25 ) and bronze ( @entity24 ) at the @entity67			1
while sibling rivalry is often frowned upon or seen as a bad thing , the brothers are adamant it is what has driven them to glory			1
@entity24 explained : ' sibling rivalry has massively helped our careers			1
it 's taught us how to compete and not to be scared of competition			2
we can learn from each other and spur each other on			2
if @entity25 beat me at table tennis in the garden i would go away and practise to be better so i could beat him			2
i think sport can teach a lot of life skills			1
' he revealed he may never have become an olympian if he was n't inspired or pushed in training by his big brother			0
the brothers in action at @entity67 : @entity25 said having his brother nipping at his heels has spurred him on to gold successful sibling rivalry : @entity25 won the @entity22 triathlon last year while @entity24 took the bronze he said : ' i swam and ran anyway but might not have tried triathlon if it was n't for @entity25			1
and i definitely would n't be as good			0
' @entity25 is a barrier - breaker with his training and racing			0
coaches used to tell him when he was younger , " you ca n't do that amount of training " and he said " yes i can "			0
' i would have listened to those coaches and done less training but seeing @entity25 do it made me realise i could too			0
i have learnt a lot from him			0
i remember when he got his first @entity113 kit , i thought i want that			0
' @entity25 adds that having his younger brother nipping at his heels has also pushed him to be the best in the world			0
' you always want to beat your little brother and him catching up with me pushes me to go forward a bit more , ' he said			0
competitive : the brothers love to challenge one another get active : the brothers say joining a club and setting a goal is important to keep you motivated the brothers admit when they younger they were competitive about ' anything and everything ' but today they save their rivalry for racing			1
however , they also support one another when competing where they can , working together on the bike section and giving one another words of encouragement			0
and still nursing the pain of being outsprinted by @entity141 @entity140 for victory at the @entity143 in september , @entity24 admitted if he is ever beaten , he 'd rather it was by his brother			0
build your own assault course @entity148 for apples play hide and seek in the great outdoors play @entity151 build paper aeroplanes and see whose can go the furthest have a pogo stick race have a tug of war make a tree house have a breakdancing competition get on your bike thanks to their rivalry , the @entity160 were chosen to be brand ambassadors for @entity164 as their latest advert for their @entity167 loaf features two brothers squabbling over who is the best			2
of their involvement with the campaign , which included coming up with the ideas to get children active at half term , @entity24 said : ' it was a lot of fun casting our minds back to all the hilarious stuff we got up to playing together as kids			1
my brother and i spent many a school holiday making up games and challenging each other			2
' but aside from the fun activities like break dancing and den building that the @entity160 recommend , what they really want to encourage children to do is find a love of sport like they have			1
for children who want to follow in their footsteps , the brothers , who are now are targetting medals at next year 's @entity199 and the @entity200 , recommend joining a club			1
@entity24 said : ' parents should encourage their children to try triathlon and show them how fun it is			1
finding a club is important , every area should have one local to them now			0
they can meet new people there and make friends who they can compete and train with			0
' @entity25 said joining a club is also important for adults who want to get fit			0
he said : ' join a club or arrange a time to go out with your friends			0
it 's so much easier when you get home from work to get out again if you know there 's a group session you can join in or you 're meeting up for a run with your friends			0
' @entity24 believes that setting a goal , such as a race , will also help children and adults stay motivated			2
to this end , the brothers recently staged their own event , the @entity232 , at a @entity234 property in @entity30			0
thousands of people of all ages and abilities took part and it was such a success they hope to do more around the country in the future			1
@entity242 provide information on their website ( www.britishtriathlon.org/clubs/index.php ) on clubs around the country and how you can join them			0
thumbs up : children who have taken part in @entity252 events have had fun whilst keeping fit future olympians ? the @entity234 have staged events around the country to get children active a new charity founded last year , the @entity252 , is also making strides to get children involved in the sport			1
they have been visiting schools and staging events around the country where children can have fun whilst competing			1
many of the events for children of all ages involve the traditional swim , bike and run whilst others have sections on scooters or duathlons ( races where participants run then cycle then run again )			2
