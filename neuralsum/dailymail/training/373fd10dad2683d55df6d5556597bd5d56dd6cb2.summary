the @entity112 for @entity10 ' @entity113 ( @entity114 ) : a ground - penetrating radar that provides centimetre - scale resolution of the geologic structure of the subsurface			0
the instrument will also be able to detect the presence of organic compounds in rocks from a distance			1
meanwhile , @entity124 for @entity88 ( @entity125 ) will provide fine - scale imaging and uses an ultraviolet ( @entity56 ) laser to determine fine - scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds			1
‘ the rocks on @entity10 tell a story , ’ said mr @entity30			0
‘ they tell a story about the history of @entity10 , and the words of the story are written in minerals			0
and that ’s what this rover is going to read			0
’ one of the key features is the fact that the rover ’s 99lb ( 45kg ) payload will be able to bring intact samples back to @entity145 , without it being crushed			1
@entity146 , a set of sensors , will provide measurements of temperature , wind speed and direction , pressure , relative humidity and dust size and shape			0
‘ we are excited that @entity19 ’s @entity161 is partnered with @entity162 and the @entity163 to demonstrate our abilities to harvest the @entity10 atmosphere and convert its abundant carbon dioxide to pure oxygen , ’ said @entity157 , deputy associate administrator for programs for the @entity159			1
‘ this technology demonstration will pave the way for more affordable human missions to @entity10 where oxygen is needed for life support and rocket propulsion			1
’ these instruments will be carried onboard the agency ’s @entity10 2020 mission , a roving laboratory based on the @entity2			1
the ‘ roving laboratory ’ will be powered by a radioisotrope generator that gives the rover an operating life - span of at least a full @entity10 year			1
this equals 687 days on @entity145			1
the space agency said it received 58 proposals in january for science and exploration technology instruments to fly on board the @entity10 2020 mission			1
@entity114 is a ground - penetrating radar that provides centimetre - scale resolution of the geologic structure of the subsurface an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer with a built - in high resolution imager than can determine the fine scale elemental composition of martian surface materials			0
@entity77 will make it possible to make detailed detection and analysis of chemical elements than ever before this was twice the average number of proposals submitted for instrument competitions in the recent past and an indicator of the extraordinary interest in exploration of the red planet			0
@entity19 hopes the 2020 @entity10 rover will demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet and look for signs of life			1
for instance , the rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by @entity10 dust			2
it could also demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide , which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel			1
@entity19 's next @entity10 rover ( plans pictured ) has been given a mission to find signs of past life and to collect and store rock from the the red planet that will one day be sent back to @entity145			1
@entity10 2020 will also demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet @entity42 is an instrument that provides imaging , chemical composition analysis , and mineralogy			1
it will also be able to locate organic compounds in rocks , from a distance it will use the same body of @entity19 's @entity2 , which is currently searching for life on @entity10 , and beginning the journey to its final destination			1
the new rover will also use the same landing system as @entity2 , which was a ground - breaking chassis and ' sky crane ' to arrive on @entity10 in one piece			2
as a result , @entity10 2020 is estimated to cost $ 1.5 billion - one billion less than its predecessor @entity2			1
the new design , which will collect rock samples , marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity259 's challenge of sending humans to @entity10 in the 2030s			0
@entity30 , @entity19 's associate administrator for science in @entity264 , said : ' crafting the science and exploration goals is a crucial milestone in preparing for our next major @entity10 mission			2
' in april , head of the @entity272 space programme @entity273 , said : ' if this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species , we need to go to @entity10 , and @entity10 is a stepping stone to other solar systems			0
' mr @entity273 revealed plans for the series of ' stepping stones ' to the red planet , which included ' lassoing ' an asteroid			0
it also included growing plants in space , and using 3d printers for onboard repairs			0
the next generation rover ( illustrated ) will carry on exploring the @entity10 , with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine @entity10 ' rocks			1
the mission marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity259 's challenge of sending humans to @entity10 in the 2030s the next generation rover will carry on exploring the @entity10 , with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine @entity10 ' rocks			1
the rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of @entity10 life			2
it will identify and collect a collection of rock and soil samples , which it will be able to send back to @entity145 intact , unlike the powdered samples collected by the current rover			1
@entity312 , director of @entity19 's @entity313 , has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to @entity145 is @entity19 's top priority			2
scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by @entity10 dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to @entity10 and the future colonisation of the planet			1
the rover marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity259 's challenge of sending humans to @entity10 in the 2030s			0
the 2020 mission aims to build on the accomplishments of @entity2 and other @entity10 missions			0
the @entity334 rovers , along with several orbiters , found evidence @entity10 has a watery history			0
curiosity has also confirmed that past environmental conditions on @entity10 could have supported living microbes			0
according to the @entity342 , looking for signs of past life is the next logical step			0
the rover will use its instruments for visual , mineralogical and chemical analysis down to microscopic scale to understand the environment around its landing site			0
it will also identify biosignatures or features in the rocks and soil that could have been formed biologically			0
@entity355 , chairman of the @entity342 and a professor of geological sciences at @entity358 in @entity359 , said : ' the @entity10 2020 mission concept does not presume that life ever existed on @entity10			2
' ' however , given the recent curiosity findings , past @entity10 life seems possible and we should begin the difficult endeavor of seeking the signs of life			2
' no matter what we learn , we would make significant progress in understanding the circumstances of early life existing on @entity145 and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life			0
' there are plans for the next rover to collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil with the intention of a later mission picking them up bringing them back to @entity145 for more definitive analysis in laboratories			2
in a bid to save time and money , the @entity10 2020 rover will share the body of @entity19 's @entity2 ( model pictured ) which is currently searching for life on @entity10			1
the new rover will use the same landing system as @entity2 , which used a ground - breaking chassis and ' sky crane ' to arrive on @entity10 in one piece			2

new curiosity rover set will feature seven powerful instruments
**vehicle** will journey to @entity10 in 2020 to take *incredibly* detailed images that will ' knock your socks off ' with an improved @entity406
@entity42 and @entity52 will detect organic compounds in rocks
next generation rover will also include ' @entity6 ' - a machine that converts carbon dioxide to pure oxygen for rocket fuel
**vehicle** will bring intact samples back to @entity145 without crushing them
rover will have a life span of one full @entity10 year - 687 days on @entity145
@entity19 hopes the 2020 @entity10 rover will demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet and look for signs of life
