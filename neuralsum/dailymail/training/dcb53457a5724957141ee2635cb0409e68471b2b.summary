after @entity1 fell to a 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity3 on sunday , @entity0 asked fans ' blog @entity4 what exactly is going wrong under manager @entity8			1
@entity9 gives us 10 reasons why the former @entity13 boss is finding it tough in north @entity15			0
@entity3 's @entity16 ( left ) heads his side 's winning goal against @entity1 at @entity19 on sunday back in may i wrote for @entity21 explaining how excited i was for the @entity8 era to begin at @entity19			1
nine games into the @entity25 season , @entity1 sit 11th in the table having suffered their worst start to a league campaign since @entity30 ' infamous return of two points from eight games in the 2009 - 10 season			1
here is why it is going wrong for @entity8 so far			1
@entity1 boss @entity8 throws the ball back as he watches his side lose to @entity3 at home @entity40 hangover three out of our four league defeats so far this season have come after matches on thursday in the @entity40			1
i really do not see this as a coincidence			0
although @entity8 has often made wholesale changes to his starting xis selected between the weekend and thursday nights , mid-week journeys to the likes of @entity49 and @entity50 can not be helping our first team players ' energy levels , even if they just sit on the bench			2
mentality and a lack of characters @entity8 described @entity1 's problem as ' not tactical or physical ' , but to do with ' mentality ' after sunday 's defeat to @entity3			1
this suggests he is extremely frustrated with some of his players and and feels like they all have a lot more to give			0
with the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 leaving @entity1 over the last few seasons , the squad does appear a little devoid of players with genuine passion for the club			2
@entity79 ( right ) is one of a number of senior players who needs to step up and lead from the front it is time for experienced heads like @entity79 , @entity86 and @entity87 to lead , inspire and play by example to try and inspire some of the members of the squad who are perhaps not quite performing			0
defensive weaknesses @entity1 have conceded 13 goals in the league this season and this really is no surprise			2
whilst captain @entity87 seems like a first - choice selection , it does appear that @entity8 does n't know who his most suitable partner is			2
@entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 have all had a go next to @entity87 and have all looked pretty unremarkable			0
@entity8 needs to make a call , stick with a defensive pairing and bring continuity to the back line			2
@entity8 seems unsure whether to partner summer signing @entity100 with captain @entity87 injuries to @entity111 and @entity112 , in addition to the inability of @entity115 to break into the first team , have also meant we have been poor at full back			1
i feel like it is a matter of time before @entity121 comes in as a defensive coach			0
@entity123 short - changing yet another manager ? the signing of @entity126 is a puzzling one			0
@entity8 seemed pretty dead certain that he wanted @entity128 this summer , but instead a cheaper option at holding midfield was brought in			1
the same applies to @entity100 – a much cheaper option to @entity132 , a defender @entity8 wanted			2
how can @entity123 expect good results when the boss does n't get the players he wants ? chairman @entity123 would not sanction a big - money bid for @entity13 's @entity128 close the revolving door @entity123 has continually allowed our best players to leave , this must stop			1
from @entity141 and @entity142 to @entity143 and @entity144 , @entity1 are very much a selling club			2
the suits will point to the huge profits made on the that quartet alone , but what does it say about our ambition ? the big test next summer will be @entity86			0
arguably the league 's best shot - stopper - playing behind one of the leakiest defences – would fit in at any of @entity158 's elite teams			1
let him go and once again @entity123 will be adding credence to the argument that the best are just do n't want to stay at @entity1			2
goalkeeper @entity86 ( left ) is likely to attract attention from other clubs despite signing a new contract difficult fixtures what must not be forgotten is that @entity1 have already played three out of last season 's top four , with two of these games being away from home			1
we have also played bogey team @entity173 – our early season fixture list has been very tough			0
with @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 to play next month , @entity8 has the chance to put a run together and should be targeting nine points			1
new signings failing to impress the manager nearly a quarter of the way into the season , only one new signing has managed to properly force his way into the first - team for league games			0
whilst @entity101 has been excellent , academy prospects @entity190 and @entity192 are preferred to @entity126			0
@entity100 is in and out of the team and @entity115 can not seem to usurp @entity194 at left - back			0
@entity8 can not be happy			0
@entity126 has failed to make an impression since joining @entity1 in the summer transfer window misfiring strikers @entity79 , who could not stop scoring under @entity199 , has looked like a @entity201 player so far under @entity8			1
@entity202 has also failed to impress , and his penalty miss against @entity204 shows how low his confidence must be			0
i find it utterly bemusing that @entity208 has n't yet been given a chance in the league , and @entity8 really needs to give him an opportunity			1
striker @entity202 misses a chance to score against @entity3 as his poor form continues negative atmosphere at @entity19 @entity1 have the second most expensive tickets in the @entity25			1
the crowd expects entertainment for the prices they pay and atmospheres often become hostile and negative if things do n't go to plan			0
whilst @entity19 is n't quite as quiet as the @entity223 , things do appear to be heading that way			0
@entity8 's philosophy taking time to work @entity8 is a modern coach with modern ideas			1
it took half a season of foundation laying at @entity232 's before his @entity13 side took the @entity25 by storm			1
@entity1 fans do need to be a little more patient			0
@entity8 has tried to implement his own style at @entity19 but it is taking time to work follow the @entity240 on @entity241 @ thespursweb			0

@entity1 are ninth in the @entity25 after defeat by @entity3
spurs have failed to hit form under manager @entity8
three of @entity1 's defeats have followed @entity40 fixtures
@entity8 was not allowed to sign @entity128 last summer
@entity208 is not being given a chance despite his good form in @entity158
