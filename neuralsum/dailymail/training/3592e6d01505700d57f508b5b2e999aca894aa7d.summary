two of @entity2 's top restaurants are set to adopt a new system that will force diners to pay for their meal when they book a reservation - in the hopes of curbing dinner cancelations			1
@entity10 's @entity9 and @entity12 's the @entity11 , both owned by acclaimed chef @entity14 , will begin using @entity15 , a booking system created by restaurateur @entity17 that 's slated to launch in early 2015			1
@entity15 requires customers to reserve tables online and pay the full amount of the restaurant 's prix fixe tasting menu - including service charges - in advance , so that the post-meal bill includes only drinks			2
mr @entity17 began using a pilot version of the software in @entity39 and @entity40 , two @entity42 establishments that he co-owns with @entity43 , in 2012			1
' @entity9 and the @entity11 will work exactly like @entity39			2
pre-purchase of the tasting menu , phone call to every guest , ' he told eater			2
other eateries that have tested an early version of @entity15 include @entity52 's @entity51 , @entity54 ' @entity53 and @entity55 's recently closed @entity10 spot wd ~ 50			1
mr @entity17 will charge restaurants a $ 695 monthly fee for unlimited use of the program , which will help owners ensure that last - minute cancellations do n't affect their profits			1
be our guest : mr @entity14 said that @entity15 will make it easier for diners to book reservations at the @entity11 ( pictured ) @entity51 's owner , @entity70 chef @entity69 , told the @entity71 that @entity15 is perfect for his new restaurant @entity73 , which has only four seats and offers a tasting menu that features expensive ingredients such as spiny lobster			0
' when there is a limited supply , @entity15 works really well , ' he said			0
earlier this week , mr @entity14 told @entity80 that the new system will improve the experience of booking reservations at his restaurants , which previously required diners to call a month in advance			1
' right now when you call for a reservation at 10 a.m. , 90per cent of the time you ’ll get a busy signal , ' he said of @entity11			0
' then the majority of our guests who get through get the response of " sorry we ’re booked			0
" now they are disappointed they did n’t get a reservations			0
this affords certainly more transparency and more opportunity to get a reservation without the frustration of calling and getting a busy signal			0

@entity105 , a pre-paid booking system created by @entity42 restaurateur @entity17 , is set to launch in early 2015
