by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 14 august 2012 a four - week old baby girl has become the youngest @entity2 to receive a life - saving cardiac operation , after her heart swelled to twice its normal size within days of her birth			2
@entity7 was born with a congenital defect which gave her tiny heart only a third of the oxygen it needed to work			1
as a result , @entity7 ’s heart ballooned to twice its size - swelling from the size of a walnut to the size of an orange			1
but @entity7 , who was dubbed ‘ @entity22 ’ by her parents @entity20 , 27 and @entity21 , 32 , made an amazing recovery following groundbreaking surgery at @entity25			1
recovery : @entity7 a week after her life - saving surgery ( left ) and now with her mother @entity20 ( right ) mrs @entity7 said : ' it ’s horrible to think the pain she was going through			1
she looked healthy on the outside for those first few weeks but inside she was so poorly			0
' but she ’s meant to be here and it ’s incredible the recovery she ’s made			2
she was home within ten days and it can take babies up to four weeks to be ready to come home			0
' she ’s tiny for her age but we ’re all just so glad she ’s here			0
' she overcame a bout of pneumonia when she was just a week old but her family from @entity44 , @entity45 , were left fearing for her health once again on @entity47 this year			0
scans at @entity49 raised concerns over her heart and she was rushed to @entity25 , in @entity52 , in a critical condition on march 19			1
she was diagnosed @entity54 , @entity55 , that meant the artery to her heart muscle was connected incorrectly , starving it of oxygen			1
within hours doctors confirmed a high risk life - saving five hour operation , called a @entity63 , was needed to save @entity7 ’s life			1
left untreated , a massive 90 per cent of children born with the @entity54 defect do not live to see their first birthdays			1
@entity7 two days after surgery at @entity25			1
doctors were amazed at how quickly she recovered @entity20 said : ' i felt like i was a bit of a fraud taking her back to hospital after her pneumonia but one of the nurses noticed she was starting to go blue			0
' at the time i do n’t think i understood the enormity of the nurse taking that blood test			2
it was her quick thinking that saved her life and got her to @entity25			0
' we were told her condition was life threatening and that surgery would be needed to save her life			1
' if they had n’t checked the blood we could have taken her home and just found her dead one morning			2
' i ca n’t look at photos of @entity7 in those first few weeks , its just too upsetting			1
she just could n’t breathe and there was no way she could tell us			0
' the condition affects around one in 20,000 newborns and is often not detected until weeks or months after birth			1
doctors took @entity7 straight into theatre for heart surgery and prepared her parents for a long and difficult recovery			1
after spending three days in intensive care and a week in the cardiac ward , @entity7 was able to go home with her parents and 19 - month - old brother @entity106			1
relief : @entity7 is held by her mother @entity20 a week after the operation to fix her heart defect the timely surgery should now see @entity7 live a normal life with regular check - ups and medication to help regulate her heartbeat			1
@entity20 praised staff at the @entity118 hospital for the checks on her heart that ultimately saved her and said she now looks back on the days of @entity7 ’s surgery as a bad dream			1
she said : ' it ’s amazing to look at her now , i thought we had lost her			0
they prepared us for the worst and said it would be horrific for months afterwards but then she recovered so quickly			0
' it ’s so emotional to look back on now			0
at the time i held it together but i ’ve been worse since , constantly checking her breathing and that she ’s okay			0
' it ’s scary to think what could have happened because she did nearly die			0
even though she made such a good recovery , she has still has a way to go to be the size she should be for her age			0
' we ’ve still got a long road to go but we know what we ’re dealing with now			0
' dr @entity141 at @entity25 explained how the condition can often be diagnosed as just a cold			1
he said : ' she is the youngest we ’ve operated on and was lucky in some ways because she was diagnosed at half the age some children are			2
' often , like @entity7 ’s case of pneumonia , the condition is often diagnosed as just a heavy cold so @entity54 can take several heart scans to detect			1
' it ’s quite a subtle condition to pick up even when you ’re dealing with a specialist centre like you are here , it can be difficult to pin down			2
' the ultrasound tests we did at @entity25 meant we were able to identify the abnormality			0
' the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart are not connected so the heart beats at a lower pressure and is not fully saturated with oxygen			1
' as a result the heart swells and enlarges and @entity7 ’s heart was double the size it should have been			1
' as in @entity7 ’s case , it gets worse after birth but it is hard to detect as babies ’ heartbeats are often fast			2
this means they can mask defects such as @entity54			0
@entity25 prepare @entity7 for the life - saving surgery			1
she spent three days in intensive care afterwards ' the operation is still a fairly high risk procedure			0
the heart muscle is already sick at the start of the procedure and whilst the operation is usually a success , there is a period afterwards where the heart can not cope on its own			0
' that meant we had to provide mechanical assistance to help the heart still pump blood all round the body			1
' @entity7 ’s recovery time was remarkable , it ’s usually three or four weeks before babies of this age are ready to go home			2
' there ’s only seven centres that do this procedure nationally and we were really pleased we could help			0
' @entity7 hit the sweet spot of the @entity207			2
the team in @entity118 did a great job spotting it and we have great surgeons here who provided an excellent outcome for @entity7 and her family			2
' @entity20 and @entity21 organised a sponsored spinathon in july for the @entity214 at @entity25 , a purpose built facility that allows parents to stay on site whilst children undergo operations			0
@entity20 said : ' had this facility not been available we would have been sleeping on chairs at @entity7 ’s bedside			2
' the house allows families to be two minutes away from their sick child giving a little peace of mind at such a horrendous time			0
' it also means that your other children have somewhere to stay and play so you do n’t have the added feelings of being torn between your sick andhealthy children			0
' donations to their cause can still be made at www.justgiving.com/princessphoebe			0

@entity7 was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect that meant the blood vessels that supplied blood to her heart were not connected
one in 20,000 newborns have the condition and 90 per cent do *n't* survive beyond their first birthday without surgery
