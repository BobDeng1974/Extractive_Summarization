everyone who comes to @entity3 should know how to speak @entity4 , @entity1 @entity0 has warned as he admitted @entity1 made mistakes on immigration			1
the @entity1 leader admitted that in the past his party had been ' too timid ' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language			1
but the @entity12 said there was nothing in mr @entity0 's plans to act to reduce the number of people moving to @entity3 , after net migration hit 298,000 in a year			2
speaking in @entity30 - a marginal seat held by the @entity33 employment minister @entity32 - the @entity1 leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for @entity3 workers			1
his new unit of 100 staff will bring together people from the @entity41 and specialist police units , together with additional @entity26 enforcement staff			0
the unit will be empowered to investigate abuse and be challenged to increase prosecutions and fines levelled against employers who break the rules			0
but he also warned that migrants must learn to speak @entity4 , especially in key services like the @entity54			1
mr @entity0 said : ' our communities are changing fast but we do n't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds			1
' instead we must find a way to live together across communities			1
' a @entity3 where people of all backgrounds , all cultures , all religions , can practise their own faiths but also come together to forge a common identity			0
' but we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language			1
' in his speech in @entity73 , northern @entity74 , mr @entity0 insisted that there was an ' epidemic of exploitation ' he said his own parents had learned to speak @entity4 after arriving from @entity79 in 1940			1
' it is why i believe in a simple principle : everyone in @entity3 should know how to speak @entity4			1
' sometimes , we 've been too timid about this but it is something we should expect from everyone who comes here			0
' and it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak @entity4			1
' he said that ' nowhere is that more true ' than in the health service			0
' we all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our @entity54			1
doctors , paramedics , social workers , nurses			0
bringing specialist skills that we need			0
' i will never demean or devalue their contribution to our country			0
' but it is vital that people who come to fulfil these roles do n't just have the right medical skills , but can communicate with those for whom they care			2
' so in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak @entity4 to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients			1
' the @entity1 leader , pictured greeting staff and students at @entity117 , also used the speech to promise @entity1 would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration mr @entity0 told the audience how his ' parents came to @entity3 to flee the horrors of @entity126 '			1
he said : ' they found a country that welcomed them and offered them the opportunity to build a new life			0
to work hard and make a contribution			0
' i would n't be standing here today , asking you to elect me your prime minister , if it was n't for the generosity of this great country			2
conservative immigration minister @entity142 said nothing @entity0 is proposing would help control immigration ' where we are always stronger when we draw on the widest range of talents , perspectives and cultures			0
' but i also know for that to happen , there have to be proper controls on immigration			0
we have got to have the right rules in place and with a @entity1 government we will			2
' he went on : ' i 've been very clear about the mistakes the last @entity1 government made			2
' we were wrong not to ensure there were maximum transitional controls when new countries joined the @entity164 in 2004			2
' and the reason we were wrong is that working people were seeing dramatic changes in their communities that were not planned or properly prepared for			2
' and we wo n't make that mistake in future			0
' conservative immigration minister @entity142 said : ' nothing @entity0 is proposing would help control immigration			0
@entity1 sent out ' search parties for people ' and under them net migration increased more than five-fold			1
' since 2010 , we have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students , cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages , made it harder for people to live in the @entity3 illegally , and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop spurious attempts to remain in the country			0
' and the next @entity33 government will seek changes to the operation of @entity190 free movement rules as a key part of our plan to renegotiate @entity3 's relationship with the @entity164			0
' but a vote for @entity0 would risk all of that with a @entity1 - @entity196 stitch up			1

@entity1 leader says speaking @entity4 is especially important in the @entity54
says communities can not live together if they do n't have shared language
warns exploitation drives low - skilled migration and holds down wages
admits it was wrong to open the doors to @entity209 in 2004 without curbs
