by @entity1 reporter published : 14:45 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 20:12 est , 8 january 2014 @entity4 head @entity3 has spoken out about how he wants to launch an entirely new channel dedicated to teaching ' the kids ' history with the help of his star anchor @entity9 while keeping the changes at @entity4 to a minimum			1
he also said that he has no concerns about @entity4 staying at the top spot in cable news since his main competitors - saying that @entity17 ' dodged a bullet ' by firing @entity19 and slamming @entity20 as effectively ' throwing in the towel ' by adding more documentaries to their programing line up			1
' there are some good , smart people at those networks , and even occasionally a blind pig finds an acorn , ' he told @entity29 of @entity20 and @entity17			1
what 's next : @entity3 ( left ) has revealed that he wants to launch a history - focused channel with @entity9 ( right ) since the @entity4 anchor dedicates so much of his time to writing historical books the notoriously private @entity3 gave a rare interview just as news about an explosive new tell - all about his paranoid working style and bizarre personal behavior			1
the news chief refused to co-operate with the book and said : ' @entity41 said , i think it was @entity41 , " what other people think of me is none of my business , " ’ he told the magazine			1
@entity9 : ' i think @entity49 can last as long as he wants because he 's driven by organic energy			1
he likes money , but he 's not doing it for the money			2
he probably likes power , but he 's not doing it for the power			2
' @entity55 : ' she 's recognizable , she 's attractive , and she still has the message of stop raising taxes ...			1
i 'm not a defender of everything she says			0
i do n't hear everything she says			0
but i know she represents a certain group of people who rose up against their own party , which you rarely see			0
i probably hired her back , if you really want to get to the bottom of it , to give her a chance to say her piece and piss off the people that wanted her dead			0
' @entity81 : ' if they have to beat up somebody as talented as @entity81 on @entity82 , they 're pathetic			1
' @entity83 : ' she was in a tough spot on @entity85			1
she always came to play and always had a smile on her face , and that 's critical in morning television			2
i knew she would work well here			0
it was a matter of just convincing her to come over			0
' @entity92 , a new @entity94 hire from @entity95 : ' she 's a star			1
' @entity96 : ' he calls once every day or two usually just to gossip and catch up on the news			2
' @entity19 : ' ( @entity17 ) dodged a bullet			1
they put him in there , and they would 've had to fire him for no ratings			1
he gave them a reason to get fired			2
' @entity105 : ' on a personal level , i like her			0
i do n't want to hurt her career , so i wo n't say we get along , but i 've had dialogue with her , and she 's very smart			2
' ' attacking me and @entity4 is nothing new – it ’s a cottage industry			1
what ’s new is that @entity115 refused to fact check the content with me or @entity4 - that tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda			1
' @entity3 , 73 , is proud of the conservative network and said that he sees it expanding to appeal to their audience			0
he cited the fact that they bumped anchor @entity81 to the primetime line up from her afternoon spot in an effort to appeal to younger viewers			1
the work that @entity9 does outside of his show - namely writing books and promoting specials with a historical edge - as a possible new venue for growth , but pointedly saying that there were no plans for @entity9 to leave the @entity4 line - up anytime soon			1
' he likes money , but he 's not doing it for the money			0
he probably likes power , but he 's not doing it for the power			0
he 's driven by things that he sees that are not right from his point of view , ' @entity3 said of @entity9 in the @entity29 interview			1
' i would like @entity151 to form a history channel and let @entity49 work with me			0
i 'd run it for him because i 'd like history done correctly for a change			0
they 're not teaching the kids the real stuff			0
' one of his most controversial recent hires - or more accurately , re-hires - was former @entity162 governor @entity55			1
he said that while he does n't necessarily agree with everything she says - let alone does he always hear all of her statements - he decided to re-up			0
that was reason enough for mrs @entity55 , as she posted a recent photo of herself during a visit to the @entity4 set just hours after @entity3 ' interview went live			1
' @entity4 ’s @entity3 says he hired me “ to piss off the people that wanted her dead			2
i accepted for the same reason ! ' she wrote as the caption			0
he - expectantly - painted a very rosy picture of life inside @entity151 , saying how he has a very comfortable relationship with owner @entity96			0
' he wanders in and ruins my schedule and just wants to talk			0
he calls once every day or two usually just to gossip and catch up on the news ...			0
i think that 's the way it is with @entity96			0
if you deliver money , you do fine , ' @entity3 said			0
when the conversation turned to other channels , he said that @entity4 's longstanding hold on the highest ratings in cable news was not threatened because even though @entity20 won viewers with a recent film about @entity197 's killer whales , that is not a sustainable method for a news channel			1
close : @entity3 says that @entity96 ( seen together in 1996 ) regularly calls in for a chat but leaves him to run @entity4 largely on his own since the channel is doing so well taking the compliment : @entity55 posted this photo to her @entity205 account from a recent trip to @entity4 and she said that she accepted the job for the same reason that he offered it - to spite her critics ' that means @entity4 has won the cable news wars			1
( @entity20 head @entity212 ) had a big hit with a whale one night ( the documentary @entity216 )			2
i guess he 's going to do whales a lot			0
if i were discovery , i 'd be worried , ' @entity3 said			0
he did n't mention any @entity20 hosts by name in his critique , but had nothing but kind words for @entity17 's @entity105 who he likes ' on a personal level '			1
the channel 's decision to fire @entity19 - who regularly makes barbs about @entity4 ’s conservative broadcasting - after he was taped - once again - making homophobic comments , @entity3 said that his competitors made the right move			1
' they put him in there , and they would 've had to fire him for no ratings			2
he gave them a reason to get fired , ' he said			0
@entity3 ' defensive interview comes ahead of the release of a scathing unauthorized biography stacked with outrageous stories about his time at @entity4			1
claims have been made in the tell - all called @entity245 , a contributing editor at @entity247 who has charted the 73 - year - old 's life from his childhood in @entity251 to one of the most powerful positions in television			2
@entity256 alleges that @entity3 once offered to pay a female tv producer $ 100 extra a week for sex , a damning new book alleges			2
while negotiating her salary at @entity261 in the 1980s , @entity259 claims mr @entity3 offered her the raise ' if you agree to have sex with me whenever i want			0
' @entity4 has denied the allegations			2
in another anecdote , it was claimed that mr @entity3 was so dismissive of even his best talent that he referred to star host @entity9 as ' a book salesman with a tv show '			1
despite @entity3 ' denials about the veracity of the book , @entity256 retorted in a statement to @entity275 : ' during two and a half years of reporting , i made a dozen requests both in writing and in person to speak with @entity3 about every aspect of my book , ' he said			0
@entity256 also claimed that ' a team of two fact - checkers spent more than 2,000 hours vetting the manuscript before publication			0
' ' @entity3 declined every request to discuss the reporting with me			0
' but the @entity290 's flat denials on @entity3 ' behalf , and a lack of communication between @entity256 's publisher and @entity4 , may indicate that his sources led him astray			1
' @entity115 refused to fact check the content with me or @entity4 , ' @entity3 told @entity29			2
' that tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda			0
' @entity4 confirmed to @entity303 that @entity256 made interview requests but that neither he nor his publisher sent a list of questions for fact - checking prior to the book 's publication			1

@entity4 chief is under fire as a new book will be published shortly claiming that he bad - mouthed @entity9 and *propositioned* a female hire
ailes gave a rare sit - down interview and slammed his competitors @entity20 and @entity17 for ' throwing in the towel ' in the ratings race
*praised* @entity4 and said that he wants to launch a new venture focused on the ' real ' version of history with @entity9
gave his thoughts on a bevy of @entity4 figures like @entity81 ( ' talented ' ) , @entity55 ( ' attractive ' ) and @entity83 ( ' in a tough spot ' )
says @entity20 and @entity17 - @entity4 's top competitors - are ' no longer in the news business '
