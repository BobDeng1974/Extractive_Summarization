worryingly , specialist drugs officers say cocaine taken in combination with alcohol is fuelling violence on @entity19 ’s streets			1
tainted : drugs specialists say users were taking cocaine so they could continue drinking into the early hours yesterday , one warned @entity26 ’s 24 - hour drinking laws had sparked a rise in cocaine use - as it was taken by drinkers who want to stay out all night			1
details of the growing prevalence of cocaine were given to a meeting of the government ’s official drugs body yesterday			1

’ @entity37 constabulary , along with 10 other forces in @entity62 and @entity63 , routinely test bank notes seized during raids to test for levels of drugs			1
up to 70 per cent of notes taken from suspected drug dealers have cocaine traces on them			1
but the programme has also tested around 5,000 ordinary notes and has found startling rises in positive cocaine tests in recent years			1
six years ago around four per cent of notes showed cocaine residue from a simple swab test			1
but the most recent figures show that has nearly trebled to 11 per cent			0
recent tests have also shown rising evidence cocaine is being mixed with @entity83 - the active ingredient in the dance drug ecstasy			1
often cocaine is mixed with @entity83 and users are unaware they are taking a drug cocktail			2
notes are often rolled up by users to ‘ snort ’ lines of the drug			0
@entity93 pointed to figures from @entity97 @entity96 university that showed before the @entity42 - which came into force in 2005 - most cocaine users said they took the drug for ‘ confidence in social situations ’			2
but recently the same study - of 17 - 29 year - olds - has shown the reason given most often was so they could ‘ keep going and stay awake ’			0
around one in 11 adults in @entity62 and @entity63 admit having ever taken cocaine			2
