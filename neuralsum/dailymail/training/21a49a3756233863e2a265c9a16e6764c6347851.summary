doctors in @entity2 are killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia , new figures have revealed			1
the statistics also show a huge 27 per cent surge in the number of euthanasia cases in the last year alone			1
the soaring number of deaths will inevitably fuel fears that euthanasia is out of control in @entity2 , a country which only months ago became the first in the world to allow doctors to kill terminally ill children			1
there have been a surge in the number of euthanasia deaths in @entity2 since it was legalised in 2003			1
earlier this year there were protests to stop the law being extended to children the figures , published in @entity26 , @entity2 ’s leading @entity27 - speaking newspaper , showed that 1,816 cases of euthanasia were reported in 2013 compared to to 1,432 in 2012 , an overall increase of 26.8 per cent			1
‘ you could say that currently there are 150 cases of euthanasia per month in @entity2 or , even more telling , five people euthanised a day , ’ the newspaper said			1
of the total number of cases in 2013 , 51.7 per cent were male patients and 48.3 per cent were female			1
elderly people aged between 70 and 90 years made up just over half ( 53.5 per cent ) of the total			2
those aged between 60 and 70 years represented 21 per cent and those aged over 90 years seven per cent			0
the under - 60s accounted for just 15 per cent of the total number of cases			1
in 2003 @entity2 was the second country in the world to legalise euthanasia after @entity51 liberalised the law a year earlier , becoming the first country since @entity54 to permit the practice			1
over the past decade the numbers of @entity2 dying by euthanasia has crept up incrementally			2
controversial : in february , the @entity58 voted in favour of extending the policy to children who are terminally - ill or in a state of unrelieved suffering there was a 25 per cent increase in the number of euthanasia deaths from 2011 to 2012 , soaring from 1,133 to 1,432 , a figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country			1
in february @entity2 extended euthanasia to children who are terminally - ill and in a state of unrelieved suffering			2
they must also be judged to have ‘ capacity of discernment ’ , affirmed by a psychologist , and the consent of their parents before they can die by injection			0
anti-euthanasia campaigners have argued that such safeguards have consistently proved to be meaningless			0
they say that besides patients who are gravely ill euthanasia is used increasingly on people with depression or non-terminal conditions			0
those killed include deaf twins @entity90 and @entity91 , 45 , who were granted their wish to die in december 2012 after they learned they would likely to become blind			0
last year @entity93 , 44 , a transsexual , was also killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation , leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a ‘ monster ’			0
disability rights campaigner @entity100 of the @entity104 - based @entity103 pressure group said the figures demonstrated the difficulties in regulating euthanasia			0
she said that once a country legalised assisted suicide or euthanasia people were inevitably killed in greater numbers than ever envisaged			0
the figures should serve as a warning to the @entity114 not to change the law on homicide to allow even assisted suicide , she said			0
‘ as the numbers of people dying from euthanasia in @entity2 grow , that slippery slope comes into vision , ’ said @entity118 of @entity119 on @entity120 , @entity121			2
‘ i am vulnerable , ’ said mrs @entity100 , who has been in a wheelchair since the 1990s when she developed @entity129 syndrome			0
‘ i ’m afraid of becoming another statistic , another faceless victim , ’ she said , adding : ‘ we are told that safeguards will protect us from abuses			0
they certainly do not protect the elderly in @entity2			2
