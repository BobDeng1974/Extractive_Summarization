@entity0 has come underfire for ' fat shaming ' with its latest installment of the hit cartoon series @entity4			1
in its new direct - to - video release , @entity6 , the female lead @entity7 gets ' cursed ' during an adventure in @entity9 and is horrified to see her body morph from a size 2 to a size 8			1
many viewers have criticized @entity0 for the plot line , loosely based on @entity15 , stating that it sends the wrong message about body image to children , especially when the average dress size among @entity21 women is reported to be a 14			1
some have also suggested that @entity7 's new shape looks far bigger than a size 8			1
@entity7 gets cursed and ( horror of horrors ) she finds that ’s she ’s gone from a “ size two to a size eight , ” even though she ’s been drawn by animators who apparently have never seen a size - eight woman in real life before			1
' " @entity53 " is drawn like she 's @entity50 from @entity51 , like she 's puffed up like a balloon			0
' he continues : ' it 's sad to think that my daughter ca n’t even watch a cartoon about a dog solving mysteries without negative body stereotypes being thrown in her face			0
' ' " @entity53 " is drawn like she 's @entity50 from @entity51 , like she 's puffed up like a balloon ' agreeing with mr @entity37 ' comments , @entity65 from @entity66 , @entity67 , notes on @entity69 : ' shame ! # @entity4 fat - shames @entity7 , saying she ’s a size 8 ( like that ’s bad ? ! ) and depicting it more like a size 28			1
' and an equally outraged @entity75 from @entity76 , @entity77 , adds : ' guess we wo n't be seeing the new # @entity4 movie			1
not paying to mess w / my daughters ' # bodyimage			1
' however , a number of viewers argue the film , which was released on dvd and @entity88 on august 19 , spreads a positive message about physical appearance			0
before the magic curse : @entity7 's usual physique in @entity4 @entity93 , who gives the film a five - star rating on @entity96 , writes : ' i actually have to defend the writers here because @entity7 realized she was being superficial			2
[ and ] most importantly : @entity99 did n't notice / care and said that she " always looked good to him			0
" ' ' i would say it was more about acceptance and not being superficial than anything			0
' in a statement to the @entity106 , @entity0 claims that it is always sensitive ' to obesity and self image , especially when it comes to programming made for children and a family audience			2
' it goes on : ' the plot of the movie involves the @entity4 gang becoming cursed and losing what means the most to each of them			2
@entity99 loses the @entity4 , @entity121 and @entity4 lose their appetites , etc. @entity7 loses her good looks ( mainly her figure and her hair )			2
' the entertainment giant also points out , like mr @entity126 , that @entity7 's longtime love , @entity99 , does not notice her new physique			0
it concludes : ' the loss of @entity7 's regular appearance is proven to be a superficial thing , and not what actually matters the most to her			0
' in 2011 , the @entity137 @entity136 deemed @entity4 the healthiest of all children 's television programs because of the amount of action it shows , with @entity4 and his gang constantly on the run from mean characters and monsters .			0
