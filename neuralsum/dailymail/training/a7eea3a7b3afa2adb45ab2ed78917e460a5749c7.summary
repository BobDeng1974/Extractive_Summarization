a heroic off - duty firefighter who helped rescue a young boy after finding him in a pool of his own blood has revealed how he gave @entity4 two breaths of cpr before covering the eight - year - old victim 's lifeless body			1
after @entity10 and brave stranger , @entity11 , saved the life of the unidentified boy whose leg had been blown off by running him a block and a half to waiting ambulances , the 30 - year - old sprinted back to the bomb site to help more victims			1
there he came across little @entity4 , one of three people who were killed in the twin bombings at monday 's @entity23			1
' we just knew he was gone , ' @entity10 told @entity25			1
' he had very serious , serious injuries			0
we took a sheet and covered him			0
' @entity10 also helped a third victim , a man in his 30s , after it was confirmed the @entity30 , @entity31 , eight - year - old had succumbed to his horrific injuries			1
' when i reached him there were just people helping as best they could , ' he said			0
' his clothes were torn and charred			0
i ca n't say if they were ripped from the blast or from people trying to save him			1
' he said the boy was very pale and was laying on his back			2
' there was nothing in his eyes , ' @entity10 said , clearly impacted by what he saw			1
at that point , @entity10 , who is a @entity58 firefighter , rushed to help another victim - this time a man in his 30s whose left leg had been amputated			1
he said by that stage @entity65 firefighters were on the scene and one member , whose name is unknown , helped him use a shoelace as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding			1
life - savers : @entity10 , center , an off - duty firefighter , and @entity11 , left , a trained police officer who works with troubled youths , ran the boy , in @entity10 's arms , a full block and a half to medical teams ' he had charring and burns on his clothes , ' he told @entity25			1
' his clothes were still smoking when we cut them off			0
we carried him to an ambulance but it already had four people in the back of it so we had to find him another one			0
there were so many victims			2
' the day began like any other @entity23 for the firefighter who was celebrating the sporting event with some drinks at a @entity97 restaurant with his girlfriend and some friends			2
but when he heard the first boom , he knew straight away that something was n't right			2
' it was very distinct to me , ' @entity10 said			1
' i had an immediate recognition of that sound			0
it 's just a feeling			2
my girlfriend looked at me and knew something was wrong			0
then the second blast went off and i knew for a fact it was n't a joke			2
' he said he yelled at the people around him to get to the back of the restaurant , ensuring his girlfriend was among them , and then rushed out onto the street , which is when he noticed the first young victim			0
listen to @entity10 's story from itemlive here : firefighter : @entity10 , seen here fighting a fire , and speaking about his heroism monday said has said he just wants to find out the boy he helped is doing			1
' it 'd make me feel better to know if we helped one person ' brave : @entity11 , left , and @entity133 , right , both sprung into action and rushed to the aid of wounded children following the explosions ' you get that initial shock and your eyes close , ' he said of the immediate aftermath of the explosion			1
' when i opened my eyes i saw chaos			2
there were people running and that 's when i noticed the boy			1
' he was far too small to be an adult so i immediately knew it was a child lying in the road , he was lying in a pool of blood			2
i ran over and noticed he had a clear amputation of his right leg			1
' he said the boy , aged he thinks between seven and eight , was in severe shock			1
' i was talking to him , asking his name , ' @entity10 told @entity25			2
' my best recognition is that it was @entity163 or @entity164			1
he was so close to the blast , his hair was blown back like someone got a hairdryer and blew it back			0
' he must have been thrown through the air			0
i was out of the restaurant so fast and he was already in the middle of the street			0
' he said the boy had suffered a full amputation of his right leg			1
' there was just soft tissue and muscle hanging , ' he recalled			0
' ten seconds earlier he was having a great time in the street and the next second his whole life has changed			2
' that 's when the firefighter teamed up with heroic stranger @entity11			1
overwhelming : @entity11 , posing for a picture with his family , said the boy they saved was ' a little peanut of a thing ' like his young daughter fate : @entity10 and @entity194 , pictured with wife @entity195 , were thrown together by fate and worked as a team to save the bleeding boy ' i identified myself as an off - duty firefighter			1
i asked him for his belt and we used it as a tourniquet to the boy 's leg			1
we needed to get him help so we carried him a block and a half to the ambulance			2
' he added , emotionally : ' we definitely saved that kid 's life			0
' @entity10 said he 's seen some pretty horrific things in his years as a firefighter , but monday 's shocking events probably come out on top			1
' this would have to rank up there , ' he told @entity25			0
' you never think you 're going to have to treat a seven or eight - year - old child in the middle of @entity97 at the @entity23 and then you turn around and see 40 more people who need help			2
' it 's not helplessness , but there 's a feeling you can only do so much			0
i 've had that feeling before of being helpless			0
it was an awful feeling			0
but i 'm glad i did my ( medics ) training , and everything kicked in at the right time			0
' @entity11 , who is trained as a police officer but does n't work in the field because of a medical condition , agreed that the senseless events were overwhelming			1
investigation : people in protective suits rake and examine material on @entity97 in @entity65 on thursday as the investigation into the bombing continues runners continue to run towards the finish line of the @entity23 as an explosion erupts near the finish line describing the boy they helped as ' a little peanut of a thing , ' @entity194 , 34 , told the @entity251 of the blasts ' immediate aftermath : ' i have a 4 - year - old daughter			1
it was all too much			0
' @entity11 's friend , @entity133 , was among the people @entity10 encountered who were trying to save @entity4			1
' he was the first one i saw , and i sprung to him			0
i wish i could 've helped more , ' @entity133 told @entity260			0
' it 's extremely sad			0
' neither @entity10 nor @entity194 , who stayed with the victim 's shaken older brother until his father collected him , got the family 's details in the chaos			1
therefore , they have no way of knowing the injured boy 's condition			1
' i 'd like to learn how he 's doing			0
it 'd make me feel better to know , ' he said			0
' it was the right place at the right time , ' @entity11 told the @entity251			2

they would not give details of their ages			0
@entity296 has a five - year - old boy still in critical condition .			1

@entity10 , an off - duty firefighter , was among those trying to save @entity4 , one of the three victims who died in the bombing

@entity11 , a trained police officer who works with troubled youths , helped him , holding his belt around the child 's leg to stop the bleeding
the heroic strangers did n't get the family 's details in the chaos and are desperate to hear the condition of the boy , named @entity164 or @entity163
