@entity0 , a likely @entity1 standard - bearer in the 2016 presidential contest , staked out her military - related positions in the 2008 race based on how they would play politically , according to a former secretary of defense who served in both the @entity8 and @entity9 administrations			1
describing a ' remarkable ' exchange he witnessed , @entity12 writes in a book due out next week that ' @entity0 told the president that her opposition to the [ 2007 ] surge in @entity17 had been political because she was facing him in the @entity19 primary			1
' @entity8 , too , ' conceded vaguely that [ his ] opposition to the @entity17 surge had been political , ' @entity12 recounts			1
' to hear the two of them making these admissions , and in front of me , was as surprising as it was dismaying			0
' and @entity12 recounts how , as the president lost faith in gen. @entity32 ' handling of hostilities in @entity34 , he – gates – lost faith in @entity8 's commitment to accomplishing much of anything			1
' as i sat there , ' he recalls , ' i thought : the president does n’t trust his commander , ca n’t stand [ president @entity45 ] @entity44 , does n’t believe in his own strategy and does n’t consider the war to be his			0
' ' for him , it ’s all about getting out			0
the commander - in - chief , he says , was ' skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail			0
' ' i never doubted @entity8 ’s support for the troops , ' @entity12 insists , ' only his support for their mission			2
' ultimately , @entity12 nearly quit over @entity8 's hand - wringing about @entity34 , he writes			1
the @entity9 administration hold - over reveals in his memoir that he was ' deeply uneasy with the @entity8 @entity88 ’s lack of appreciation – from the top down – of the uncertainties and unpredictability of war			1
' describing a contentious day when @entity8 evaluated his @entity34 strategy , @entity12 recalls : ' i came closer to resigning that day than at any other time in my tenure , though no one knew it			2
' mrs. @entity0 's cameo in the book is more brief but equally damning			0
@entity0 's portrait as first lady hangs in the @entity88 , but she wants a ' @entity106 president ' version to accompany it -- a goal that 's complicated by her past political record @entity12 describes @entity8 as a feckless commander - in - chief who was less interested in winning wars than in taking political advantage of withdrawing @entity56 from them while a @entity56 senator and former first lady , she announced in the days leading up to her entry in the 2008 @entity88 race that that she opposed the @entity9 administration 's ' surge ' of 20,000 troops in @entity17			1
at the time , she proposed a freeze in the number of active military troops there , and suggested instead that more @entity56 forces should be sent to @entity34 to protect against a feared @entity126 offensive			0
in late 2006 , nearly two years before the @entity1 ' nominating convention , @entity127 could not afford to be seen as hawkish when other @entity1 – especially @entity8 , her presumed principal opponent – were blaming president @entity9 for putting ever - more boots on the ground in the @entity132			1
former defense secretary @entity12 ' memoirs will go on sale january 17 in the @entity136 , she had voted in favor of an october 2002 use - of - force resolution that put the @entity56 on war footing against @entity17 , following allegations that the dictator @entity141 possessed weapons of mass destruction			1
@entity12 praises @entity127 elsewhere in his memoir , titled ' duty : memoirs of a secretary at war			2
' the @entity148 published the first preview of the book on tuesday			0
she struck him , he writes , as ' smart , idealistic but pragmatic , tough - minded , indefatigable , funny , a very valuable colleague , and a superb representative of the @entity56 all over the world			0
' @entity12 has harsh words for the sitting vice president as well			0
@entity158 , he writes , ' has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades			1
' and the veep , he says , spent his time and attention ' poisoning the well ' against @entity166 leaders in order to influence @entity8 toward leaning more on his domestic political advisers hen tough military decisions had to be made			2
and he described in a @entity171 essay adapted from his book that he resented the @entity8 @entity88 's national security staff ( @entity174 ) for its habit of interfering in military affairs			1
' most of my conflicts with the @entity8 administration during the first two years were n't over policy initiatives from the @entity88 , ' @entity12 declares , ' but rather the @entity174 's micromanagement and operational meddling , which i routinely resisted			1
' ' for an @entity174 staff member to call a four - star combatant commander or field commander would have been unthinkable when i worked at the @entity88 – and probably cause for dismissal			0
it became routine under @entity8			0
i directed commanders to refer such calls to my office			0
' ' the controlling nature of the @entity8 @entity88 , ' says @entity12 , ' and its determination to take credit for every good thing that happened while giving none to the career folks in the trenches who had actually done the work , offended secretary @entity127 as much as it did me			1
' @entity8 , shown during a 2010 trip to @entity34 , doubted that his own troop surge in that country would meet with any success , @entity12 writes , but he ultimately decided to pull out of the country in order to help his re-election chances @entity12 writes that @entity158 was ' wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades ' -- but the @entity88 rushed to the vp 's defense in a short statement tuesday evening from the @entity88 , @entity213 spokeswoman @entity212 said president @entity8 ' disagrees with secretary @entity12 ' assessment			1
' ' @entity158 has been one of the leading statesmen of his time , ' @entity212 said , ' and has helped advance @entity56 's leadership in the world			0
president @entity8 relies on his good counsel every day			0
' but @entity8 had nothing specific to say about @entity12 ' accusation that he was a cynical and ineffective commander - in - chief whose foreign policy positions were more about politics than principle			1
' deliberations over our policy on @entity34 have been widely reported on over the years , ' the statement continued , ' and it is well known that the president has been committed to achieving the mission of disrupting , dismantling and defeating @entity233 , while also ensuring that we have a clear plan for winding down the war , which will end this year			0
' @entity12 sees things differently , writing that during his tenure at the @entity238 ' simply wanted to end the " bad " war in @entity17 and limit the @entity56 role in the " good " war in @entity34			2
' but the president 's stated reasons for pulling out of @entity17 and @entity34 , he claims , ' conflicted with his own pro-war public rhetoric ( especially during the 2008 campaign ) , the nearly unanimous recommendations of his senior civilian and military advisers at the @entity245 , and the realities on the ground			2
' ultimately , he concluded , @entity8 was ' inexperienced ' yet ' determined to change course – and equally determined from day one to win re-election			0
' ' domestic political considerations would therefore be a factor , though i believe never a decisive one , in virtually every major national security problem we tackled			2

@entity12 , secretary of defense under @entity8 and @entity9 , writes that @entity0 made a callous political move in 2006
she announced her opposition to @entity9 's @entity17 troop ' surge ' just before entering the presidential race
@entity12 writes that she admitted making that *choice* in order to avoid being politically *outflanked* by @entity8 as they entered the 2007 primary *season*
the revelation could prove problematic for @entity127 as she *prepares* what political *observers* see as a second run at the @entity88 in 2016
the former defense secretary says @entity8 believed his own troop surge – the move of 30,000 troops into @entity34 – would fail
he also attacked vp @entity158 , saying he ' has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue '
the @entity88 *responded* , saying @entity8 ' disagrees with secretary @entity12 ' assessment ' and defending @entity158 as a ' leading statesman '
