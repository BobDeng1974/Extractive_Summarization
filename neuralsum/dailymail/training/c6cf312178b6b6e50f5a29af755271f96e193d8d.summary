@entity32 , who was foraging in the woods near @entity34 survived the attack but suffered bites as well as scratches to his wrist , legs , knee and back			0
a team of specialists was then sent to search for their bear , who was reintroduced to the @entity6 countryside as part of an @entity49 - funded operation after they were almost wiped out decades ago			0
but animal rights activists say the bear should have been left alone as she was merely trying to protect her eight - month - old cubs			1

the last picture to be taken of @entity58 , using an infra - red camera , shows her with one of her young cubs			0
activists say she should have been left alone and not pursued @entity6 's national forestry police opened an investigation and speculated that criminal charges could result for the mistreatment and death of an animal			0

capture was ordered after the bear attacked a man picking mushrooms
but after @entity11 was tranquilised , she failed to wake up from anaesthetic
