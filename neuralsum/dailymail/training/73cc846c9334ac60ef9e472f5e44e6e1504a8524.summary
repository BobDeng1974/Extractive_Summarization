thousands of bears are being detained in minute cages for the entirety of their lives and forced to endure regular painful procedures so that their bile can be regularly harvested			1
at least 20,000 of the once majestic mammals are estimated to be trapped in bear bile facilities across @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , according to @entity14 , a regional project manager for @entity15			1
' they sit in metal cages that are elevated off the ground and they are denied basic animal welfare conditions , ' mr @entity14 , who has travelled to @entity9 at least five times in the last year to visit these facilities and negotiate with governments , told @entity24			1
@entity47 facilities are horrible places			0
' the bile ' farm ' business revolves around the demand for bear bile , which is extracted from the animal 's liver before being turned into powders , ointments and capsules			1
' @entity47 , or @entity60 acid , is an organic product that actually does have some pharmaceutical and therapeutic value - but nothing outside what you can achieve from a paracetamol , ' mr @entity14 said			0
the bile facilities , such as the one pictured , are located throughout @entity70 and are regulated by different laws , depending on the country methods of bile extraction also vary from country to country : this bear , in @entity9 , is knocked out with a strong tranquilliser each month before a large syringe or catheter is inserted deep into his gall bladder in @entity10 , where it is legal to breed bears and slaughter them at 10 years of age for the sole purpose of extracting bile , the mammals are bred and caged for their entire lives before being killed			1
the bile ( pictured in the clear bottle ) is then extracted or the gall bladder harvested ' there 's no excuse or reason why these animals should be suffering for what can be replaced by herbal and synthetic alternatives			2
' the myths and traditional @entity70 medicinal belief is that it can be used to cure a number of ailments ; hangovers are a common one in @entity9 and it has also been suggested that it can ease suffering from liver disease and damage			2
it 's often added to things like haemorrhoid creams and it has even been called a cure all – some people believe it can cure cancer			2
' aside from ' medicinal purposes ' , the fluid is also used for entertainment purposes , according to @entity15 , and is drunk to demonstrate affluence			0
in recent years it has also been added to various lifestyle and beauty products such as energy drinks , toothpaste and shampoo			1
to extract the bile , the bears are mostly subject to torturous procedures , which vary from country to country due to the different laws that are in place			2
the bile is used in a wide range of products			0
pictured : liquid bear bile and bile flakes that have been dried a haemorrhoid cream that contains bear bile powder , created by drying the bile and grounding it into a powder ( left ) and a pharmaceutical capsule for liver function with 2.5 per cent bile ( right ) ' @entity47 , or @entity148 acid , is an organic product that actually does have some pharmaceutical and therapeutic value - but nothing outside what you can achieve from a paracetamol , ' mr @entity14 said in @entity9 , mr @entity14 said it is ' legal to keep bears , but illegal to exploit them for commercial purposes ' and therefore illegal to extract bile from a live bear and sell the products			1
however there is a lack of compliance with these laws in the country , and the most common technique of bile extraction involves knocking the bear out with a powerful tranquillizer each month before inserting a large syringe or catheter deep into the bear 's gall bladder to extract the bile			0
in @entity10 , where it is legal to breed bears and slaughter them at 10 years of age for the sole purpose of extracting bile , the mammals are bred and caged for their entire lives before being killed			1
the bile is then extracted or the gall bladder harvested			0
in @entity11 , where it is also legal to own a captive bear and extract its bile , the most common technique involves ' farmers ' luring the animals into minute cages where they can barely move before piercing through the bear 's abdominal wall into the gall bladder to create a permanent hole			1
mr @entity14 is part of a team currently negotiating with the governments in @entity10 and @entity9 to help bring an end to the industry ' in @entity10 we are actually progressing quite well			2
we are currently looking at property rights issues concerning those bears and compensating farmers to exit the industry - and that 's looking promising , ' he said he added : ' in @entity9 we are working to progress towards improved legislation and policy so no new bears are able to enter the industry ' typical @entity11 methods of bile extraction involve creating a permanent hole in the bear 's abdominal wall and gall bladder which is regularly prevented from healing , causing extreme pain and medical problems ' a steel needle is then inserted into the hole and the bile is drained at regular intervals			1
alternatively a " free dripping fistula technique " is used whereby a tube is then passed into the gall bladder , typically twice daily , to extract the bile , ' @entity15 explains			0
' either way the wound is painful and bile can seep back into the abdomen , causing severe infection			0
the hole in their abdominal wall is regularly prevented from healing - this not only causes extreme pain but can lead to inflammation , abscesses , gall bladder stones and infections			0
' in most of the countries , the animals spend their entire lives in cages no larger than a telephone booth and often scar themselves from repeatedly hitting themselves against the bars in frustration			1
unnatural diets , including rice or vegetable gruel , as well as their constant cramped conditions , lead to agonising health problems			1
the organisation is working alongside the government in each of these countries to improve legislative outcome for bears			0
in most of the countries , the animals spend their entire lives in cages no larger than a telephone booth and often scar themselves from repeatedly hitting themselves against the bars in frustration a bear 's paw sits in a jar of fluid at a @entity9 stall : mr @entity14 urges anyone who wants to know how they can help , to avoid taking part in activities in which wildlife is exploited ' souvenirs , trinkets , tiger teeth , riding of elephants - all these sort of things have a negative impact on the welfare of wild animals – people need to think what their actions are doing to animals , ' he said mr @entity14 is part of a team currently negotiating with the government in @entity10 to ban the breeding of bears which he said would ' signal an end to the industry '			1
' in @entity10 we are actually progressing quite well			0
we are currently looking at property rights issues concerning those bears and compensating farmers to exit the industry - and that 's looking promising , ' he said			0
' in @entity9 we are working to progress towards improved legislation and policy so no new bears are able to enter the industry , but until we can have a quantified number of captive numbers , which we hope for by 2015 , it 's hard to say or indicate the end date for the industry			2
' mr @entity14 urges anyone who wants to know how they can help , to avoid taking part in activities in which wildlife is exploited			0
' souvenirs , trinkets , tiger teeth , riding of elephants - all these sort of things have a negative impact on the welfare of wild animals – people need to think what their actions are doing to animals , ' he said .			0

at least 20,000 bears are estimated to be trapped in bear bile facilities across @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13
the bile is extracted through regular , painful procedures
meanwhile , the mammals spend their entire lives in cages no larger than a telephone booth , eating unnatural diets and *sporting* constant injury
bear bile is *unnecessarily* added to various pharmaceuticals such as haemorrhoid cream , however it is also added to beauty products and used for entertainment
