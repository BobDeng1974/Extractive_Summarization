by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 09:43 est , 25 october 2012 this is the dramatic moment a @entity3 warship returned fire on a group of pirates in one of the world 's most dangerous shipping lanes			1
the @entity10 , @entity3 's flagship counter-piracy boat , was carrying out routine surveillance off the @entity14 coast when they spotted the suspicious dhow , a type of small boat often used by pirates			1
as it approached the boat , the pirates pulled out their @entity19 and opened fire , sparking a fierce gun battle			1
gun battle : @entity3 warship @entity23 returns fire as it comes under attack from gun - toting pirates during a routine surveillance patrol off the @entity14 coast up in flames : one person on the dhow was killed and 25 others were rescued by the warship after jumping into the ocean to escape the fire on board scene : the gun battle took place in the @entity40 , one of the world 's most dangerous shipping lanes during the exchange , the dhow caught fire , forcing the crew members to leap into the sea			1
one person on the dhow was killed and 25 people were subsequently rescued from the water by @entity10 , which has a 350 - strong crew			1
incredibly , while trying to rescue the crew from the stricken dhow , @entity10 came under sustained fire from the shore with one of its inflatable boats suffering damage			2
commodore @entity60 , the commander of the @entity61 , said : ' we know that pirates are increasingly using larger dhows as mother ships			2
therefore we routinely inspect them			0
' in this instance , the pirates openly chose confrontation			0
this does not happen often and it indicates that we are indeed impeding their operations and in doing so , pushing them to take more extreme options			0
' the coastline off the @entity74 is renowned for its piracy and @entity77 records show there are currently four vessels being pirated with an estimated 143 hostages held			0
but the @entity3 missions appear to be working with 35 vessels hijacked this year , compared to 74 during 2010			2
@entity83 added : ' firstly , it is obvious that the scourge of piracy has not gone away and we need to maintain our vigilance			1
' secondly , the risks to the pirates themselves are becoming much greater and while we regret any loss of life we will deal with any threat we encounter in a firm , robust but always proportionate manner			0
' command and conquer : @entity98 from the @entity100 frigate @entity101 destroy one pirate vessel and intercept another during counter-piracy operations in june 2009			0
@entity3 operations in the region seems to be working as the number of hijacked has gone down in recent years			0

pirates opened fire with ak - *47s* as the @entity10 was carrying out routine surveillance off @entity14 coast
one person on pirate *sailboat* killed and 25 others rescued after jumping into water as dhow went up in flames
@entity3 commander : ' it is obvious the scourge of piracy has not gone away and we need to maintain vigilance '
