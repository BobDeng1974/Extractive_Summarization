@entity1 , health secretary from 1997 - 99 , said he warned mr @entity2 that a ‘ mad rush ’ to bring in more competition and targets in hospitals could harm patients			1
but mr @entity2 ignored him and gave his @entity18 job to a crony who agreed to force through the changes			1
mr @entity1 told @entity22 : ‘ i told @entity2 that reckless changes could undermine patient care , but he did n’t want to listen			1
’ mr @entity1 criticised two of his @entity27 successors as health secretary – @entity29 and @entity30			1
he said : ‘ they became obsessed with wanting to break up the @entity5 into individual units			1
‘ i made my views known to them but was ignored			0
they preferred to take the advice of management consultants to medical consultants			0
‘ huge sums were diverted away from nurses , doctors and patients to lawyers , accountants and @entity44 men			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s comments echo @entity47 ’s claim that rather than @entity5 boss sir @entity49 , past @entity48 should take the blame for the @entity52 scandal in which hundreds of patients needlessly died			2
the @entity54 claim @entity48 has tried to save sir @entity49 because many of his fateful decisions took place when the party was in power			0
an official report last month said the desire of @entity64 health chiefs to seek elite foundation status contributed to the scandal			0
hundreds of patients died needlessly at the @entity67 because of the poor standard of care protesters have been calling for @entity5 chief sir @entity49 to resign in the wake of the mid-staffordshire hospitals scandal left - winger mr @entity1 was made health secretary when @entity2 won power in 1997			1
he was forced out when mr @entity2 appointed his close ally mr @entity29 to lead the drive towards foundation hospitals , with more competition and targets			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ when i became health secretary , a number of professors of medicine said to me , “ for @entity85 ’s sake , @entity1 , keep change to a minimum or you will distract us from looking after patients			2
” ' i never forgot their words			0
when people go to hospital they want to be in the hands of someone trained at a @entity100 medical school , not the @entity101			0
