by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 28 february 2013 a @entity2 inmate on a staggering year - long hunger strike has refused all solid food since march 2012 and lost almost half his body weight as a result claiming ' after a while , you 're not hungry anymore			1
' @entity9 , 34 , began his protest after his sentence was extended over what he says was a misunderstanding over a drugs test and now has left him on the brink of death			1
surviving only on his daily coffee and cream and a nutritional drink once a week , @entity9 weighed 230 pounds at the start of his strike but now is a skeletal 120 pounds			1
@entity9 in 2000 ( left ) when he was aged 22 and imprisoned for a series of bank robberies in @entity2 and in 2013 ( right ) after almost a year of hunger strike five months into his abstinence , @entity26 officials in @entity27 were so fearful @entity9 would die they went to court to get an order to force - feed him and end his hunger strike			1
' if medical staff can not immediately perform these measures over his objections , ' the state argued unsuccessfully on july 10 reported @entity35 , ' he will suffer irreversible organ damage sometime in the next few days and eventually die			0
' the courts sided with @entity9 , saying he had a @entity39 right to refuse to eat and eight - months on @entity9 clings to life			1
the attorney general 's office in @entity2 said that no one can ever recall a protest of this length , nor the state attempting to go to court to save the life of an inmate who refused food			1
@entity9 has been held in solitary confinement in @entity2 for the duration of his year - long hunger strike @entity9 's lawyer , @entity53 , said that currently his lips have turned gray , he has significant difficulties concentrating and has developed breathing difficulties because his diaphragm is collapsing			1
the dispute centers around @entity9 's desire to see a prison log book he claims will prove he did n't break prison regulations two - years - ago , which led to him receiving a sentence of four - months of solitary confinement			1
currently the convicted bank robber has four more years left on his sentence and the state fears if it gives into his request other prisoners will see it as a precedent			0
' the prison administration can not allow itself to be coerced by an inmate , ' said @entity74 , former @entity75 corrections commissioner and secretary of commissions in @entity78 ,			2
' the point of prison is , when you ’ve exhausted your legal options and you do n’t get what you want , you have to do what you ’re told			2
' however , according to @entity9 , 18 - months ago a prison drug dog detected something in his cell on june 14th 2011 and he was asked to submit a urine test - something which he and the @entity89 both agree on			1
@entity9 , claims though , that he was made to wait for more than two hours and had to urinate and when the guard finally requested a sample he was unable to do so			1
governor @entity92 , ( left ) and corrections commissioner @entity93 ( right ) are involved in negotiations but are unwilling to make an exception in the case of @entity9 the former high - school footballer said that the guard agreed to give him more time but later changed his mind and charged @entity101 with failing to give a sample			1
@entity9 says the log book will prove he was made to wait for more than two hours and that no drugs were found in his cell either			1
' after a while , you ’re not hungry anymore , ' @entity9 said last week in a phone interview with @entity35			2
' i do n’t want to die , but i ’m not afraid of it			0
' his lawyer , @entity53 , has pleaded with the state including corrections commissioner @entity93 and governor @entity92 to make an exception			0
' they say they would be setting a precedent for other prisoners			0
but at this point , it would n’t be setting any kind of precedent — at this point , it would be saving a life , ' said @entity53			0
@entity9 has spent nearly half his life in and out of prisons and was first arrest for robbing a gas station in 1998 with an unloaded handgun and was sentenced in 2000 for that crime as well as robberies of two other gas stations , a dry cleaner and a laundromat			2
he was sentenced to 22 years in prison and is scheduled for release in 2017			0
' all of them ( crimes ) involved guns — i knew i was going down , ' said @entity9			2
' i was a junkie			0
' admitting he was a drug addict before his entry to prison , @entity9 is proud to have never failed a drugs test inside prison			1
' i ’m not trying to get out of anything i ’ve done , ' said inmate			0
since his hunger protest began in july , @entity9 has refused all solid food			1
he takes coffee in the morning with milk and sugar and has allowed staff to give him saline or electrolytes intravenously four times			0
@entity9 has been kept alive by consuming nutritional drinks such as @entity156 weekly since december , he has had one nutritional drink , such as @entity158 , at least once a week			2
however , @entity53 said the drinks now increase his blood pressure , indicating that his body is shutting down			0
his mother , @entity162 has understandably been pushed to her wits end by her sons stance			0
' he ’s going to keep fighting the battle — i just hope he ’s alive if he wins it , ' said @entity162			0
and @entity9 himself is pessimistic about the outcome of his hunger strike			2
' there ai n’t really much plans for the future , ' he said .			0

@entity9 is close to death after refusing all food since march 2012 because of a dispute with the @entity2 over prison records
