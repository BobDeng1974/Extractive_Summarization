by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 16:02 est , 28 september 2013 on the mend : @entity2 is back on his feet after his near - death - experience with sepsis the tiny scar on @entity2 ’s hand barely merits a second glance			1
yet because of this minute cut – just half an inch long – he almost lost his life			1
barely a month ago he was lying in a hospital bed hovering between life and death , his body ravaged by sepsis , a blood condition that seriously affects at least 100,000 people every year in the @entity19 and kills almost 40,000			1
and @entity2 , 22 , a graduate and keen rugby player from @entity21 in @entity22 , was very lucky			1
his condition was diagnosed just in time to administer the intravenous antibiotics that saved his life			2
a new @entity26 report states that a third of the 37,000 deaths from sepsis every year are a direct result of misdiagnosis or poor treatment			1
substandard care in sepsis is costing the @entity35 £ 2.5 billion a year			1
sepsis – formerly known as septicaemia – occurs when the body starts to attack its own organs and tissues as the immune system responds to micro-organisms such as bacteria that are already causing infection			1
initial symptoms include feeling as though you have flu , but in extreme cases blood pressure plummets so low that vital organs are deprived of blood and shut down			2
those with mild sepsis may be safely treated with antibiotics at home , but others require urgent hospital care			1
‘ it is more common than heart attacks and more deadly than a stroke , ’ says dr @entity58 , an intensive care doctor at @entity59 , who is campaigning with the @entity60 to raise awareness of the condition and for research funds			2
‘ it kills more people every year than bowel , prostate and breast cancer combined , but it is poorly funded and diagnostic techniques are pre-victorian			2
’ normally , sepsis affects the elderly or those with existing illnesses such as diabetes , kidney problems or pneumonia			1
but the fact that @entity2 developed it from an innocuous injury is a warning to us all			1
‘ i was scratched while training with my rugby club in @entity85 last month , during a scrum , ’ he says			1
‘ somebody ’s finger must have just caught my hand			0
i did n’t think anything of it at all			0
’ just in time : as a result of the initial misdiagnosis for the sepsis as soft tissue infection , @entity2 was just hours from organ failure before given correct treatment but 48 hours later , while walking his dog , he was startled to notice that his hand had swollen			1
overnight the swelling worsened and @entity2 ’s hand and arm ballooned up to his elbow			1
‘ it felt hot , throbbed with pain and i could n’t move my fingers , ’ he says			0
his anxious girlfriend @entity108 , 21 , who works for a sports tour company , texted a picture to her mother , who works in a hospital			0
within minutes of receiving her reply , @entity2 and @entity108 were rushing to @entity114 at @entity115 , where he was diagnosed with cellulitis – an infection of the soft tissue – and transferred to @entity119 in nearby @entity120			1
sepsis occurs when the body responds to infection , and can be caused by a huge variety of bacteria – such as @entity126 , @entity127 , streptococcus or @entity129			1
chemicals released into the blood to combat the infection trigger widespread inflammation , which leads to blood clots and leaky vessels			2
symptoms include a very high or low temperature , fast breathing , racing heartbeat , confusion or slurred speech			0
the skin may also be cool , pale or mottled , and in advanced stages the patient can lose consciousness			0
about 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis each year			2
patients with the condition occupy more than 30 per cent of intensive care unit beds			0
four days later he went home , believing it was all over			0
but the next morning , @entity2 felt as if he had flu			1
‘ i had a soaring temperature , a headache and a sore throat			0
i felt dreadful , ’ he says			0
again he was persuaded by his girlfriend to go to hospital , where a blood test was taken			0
‘ initially – and confusingly , given that they had my discharge papers from the previous day – i was told i probably had tonsillitis			0
but then i was admitted to a ward			0
’ analysis of his blood had shown that he was in the middle of a dangerous attack of sepsis and just hours from organ failure			1
‘ i was barely functioning but i remember @entity108 phoning me , crying that i might die , ’ @entity2 says			1
the confusion over his diagnosis exemplifies the lack of awareness of sepsis , according to dr @entity177 , consultant in intensive care at @entity179 in @entity180 and chief executive of the @entity60			2
‘ it ought to have been the first assumption , ’ he says			0
‘ all medical professionals should be aware of the subtle and fast - changing symptoms and do the necessary tests as soon as it is even suspected			0
these include blood tests for abnormal white cell count and lactic acid levels – high levels mean organs may not be receiving enough oxygen – as well as physiological observations such as heart rate and temperature			0
‘ the earlier the condition is caught , the better			0
in severe cases , every hour ’s delay increases the risk of death by eight per cent and it is a tragic reality that often a patient is n’t referred quickly enough			0
‘ it can take up to 72 hours to diagnose , by which point the organs may have started to shut down			2
if you think you or a relative may have sepsis , do n’t hesitate to suggest it to a doctor			2
’ it is thought that by improving the speed of diagnosis , the @entity35 might save £ 170 million a year			0
after four days of aggressive intravenous antibiotics , @entity2 was well enough to go home			1
‘ i hope that my experience may warn others , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m proof that anyone can get sepsis , and i ’m very grateful not to be a statistic in the report			2

@entity2 , got sepsis after suffering a cut during a rugby scrum
however , doctors misdiagnosed this as soft tissue infection
as a result , he was hours from organ failure before given correct treatment
