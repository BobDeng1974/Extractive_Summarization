education secretary @entity10 said the @entity11 should not have used ' selfie ' photos from the internet of a @entity15 model and a @entity17 mother of two without their consent			1
the photos were used as part of a ' sting ' operation which resulted in married mr @entity7 quitting the government after being caught sending an x-rated photo of himself			1
mrs @entity26 said : ' it is not right that photos are taken without consent from anybody			0
' the paper will have to think about their conduct			0
' @entity34 mayor @entity33 said : ' i have a very high regard for @entity7 and a great deal of sympathy and i am sure he will be coming back very soon			2
' but home secretary @entity39 had little sympathy , saying : ' @entity7 should n't have done it in the first place			2
' amid a growing row over the @entity11 's story , police and the new press regulator are being asked to investigate			1
there has been no further word from father - of - five mr @entity7 since he declared himself a ' complete fool ' for posting explicit photos of himself to a woman he thought was an attractive blonde @entity53 supporter – but who was really a male undercover reporter			1
the 56 - year - old mp resigned as @entity56 at the weekend after realising that ' @entity57 ' was in fact a fake @entity59 account set up as a honey trap			1
he sent ' @entity57 ' an x-rated photo of himself after apparently requesting ' she ' send photos to him – one of which showed the legs of mother - of - two @entity0 , 26 , from @entity17 , and the other the face of @entity15 model @entity68 , 22			1
yesterday miss @entity0 said she felt ' violated ' and feared people would think she had been a willing partner in the sting			0
she told the @entity72 : ' this was a violation of my privacy			0
i know i put photos on @entity59 for the world to see but there needs to be some level of respect			0
' education secretary @entity10 ( left ) suggested the @entity11 had questions to answer about its sting involving charities minister @entity7 ( right ) , who resigned after sending an explicit photo of himself @entity53 mp @entity7 pictured with his wife @entity85 , just after he was elected mp for @entity86 in 2005 she added : ' i do n't like the fact they used one of my photos to bring someone down			1
' he 's a grown man and he may be married but the only people who should be concerned about what he 's done are him and his wife			2
' miss @entity68 told a @entity15 newspaper she felt ' exploited ' by her picture being used as the profile photo on the @entity59 account			0
' i have had a lot of emails , texts and phonecalls from different countries about it			0
it feels unreal , ' she told @entity106			0
' i do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible , both for me and others involved in this			0
' she also took to her blog to inform her followers of her photo being used as the ' face ' of the operation			0
the @entity59 profile picture of ' @entity120 ' , who is really a @entity15 model uninvolved in the sting			2
the model , whose real name is @entity68 , 22 , said it was ' offensive ' her image was used without permission this picture of ' miss @entity131 's ' legs - actually @entity0 's - was used as the journalist encouraged mr @entity7 to send explicit images			1
miss @entity0 said the mp had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign she wrote : ' i feel very confused right now and still ca n't comprehend that what has happened has happened			0
i can blog more about this another day , but right now i ca n't bare to talk about it			0
‘ this thing feels really unpleasant			0
’ @entity140 , editor in chief of the @entity11 , last night apologised to the two women			1
anger : a photo by ' @entity120 ' was in fact of unsuspecting @entity0 , from @entity17 he said : ' at no point has the @entity11 published any of these images			1
' but we would like to apologise to the women involved for their use in the investigation			0
' the newspaper has defended its story as having a ' nailed - on public interest ' , because mr @entity7 is a founder of the @entity157 campaign group which aims to attract more women into politics			1
associate editor @entity161 said : ' if you have the minister for civic society , a minister charged with getting more women into politics but seems to be [ more interested ] in getting them into his own bed , i think there is huge public interest			2
' but the undercover investigation – conducted by a freelancer and sold to the @entity11 – also targeted other @entity173 and has been branded a ' fishing expedition ' by critics			2
@entity176 – one of at least six other @entity53 mps targeted – said he was reporting the newspaper to the @entity179 and to the three - week - old successor to the @entity181 , the @entity181 ( @entity182 ) , saying it would be ' the first real test as to whether the new body , @entity182 , has any teeth '			1
lawyers and media commentators accused the newspaper of ' entrapment ' and questioned whether tricking mr @entity7 into sending the photo amounted to the crime of ' causing a person to indulge in sexual activity without consent '			1
before the @entity11 ran the story , it was turned down by both @entity198 and @entity199 .			2

' @entity120 ' was an online alter - ego used by a @entity11 reporter
married mp @entity7 sent x-rated photo of himself to the ' pr girl '
@entity208 and women 's minister raised doubts about ' conduct '
case set to be referred to the @entity181
