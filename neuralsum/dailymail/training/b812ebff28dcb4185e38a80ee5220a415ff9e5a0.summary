by @entity1 reporter parents are being warned about the dangers of liquid detergent capsules following a number of cases of children biting into them after apparently mistaking them for sweets			1
the brightly coloured capsules , which are used in dishwashers and washing machines , cause an immediate chemical burn , resulting in breathing problems as the airway swells			1
the consequences could be fatal without medical attention			1
the warning comes after five youngsters under the age of two have been admitted to the @entity21 in @entity22 this year after possibly thinking they were jelly sweets			1
dishwasher and washing machine liquitabs pose a threat to children who can mistake them for sweets , doctors have warned @entity32 methylpropional : a synthetic fragrance that is also used in a number of beauty products			1
it is considered safe only within recommended use of @entity38 , it is a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin applications at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage			2
alpha - isomethyl @entity45 : banned by the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) from being mixed into fragrance products , such as perfume and cologne , it has been found to irritate the skin and trigger allergic reactions in some people			2
however , it is still found in detergents and other cosmetics that are not classed as a ' fragrance '			2
@entity59 , @entity58 , @entity60 : severe allergens that be listed on the label because they are severe allergens			2
higher concentrations can even cause central nervous system disruption ( thus their use in certain pesticides ) and skin , eye and respiratory tract irritation			2
these chemicalc can also trigger asthma attacks			2
parents should take a child to their nearest a&e if it is suspected they have swallowed something poisonous , doctors said			2
they have also called for childproof packaging for the products to stop youngsters being able to get to them			0
dr @entity81 , from the hospital 's ear , nose and throat department , said : ' we have known for some time about the risk of eye injuries from kids squeezing these liquitabs until they burst			0
' what we have seen more recently is that children are biting into the tablets , presumably because they think they are sweets as they have the same soft texture and bright colouring			0
' the alkaline chemicals in the liquitab cause an immediate chemical burn , causing breathing problems as the airway starts to swell rapidly			1
getting them to hospital straight away is imperative			0
' in most of the cases seen so far , we have had to insert a breathing tube to protect the child 's airway from the swelling and help them breathe			1
if these children had n't reached @entity76 on time , the airway could close over completely with potentially fatal consequences			1
" once the breathing tube is inserted , children can be on a ventilator for as long as two weeks until the swelling settles			1
one child admitted to the hospital required further surgery to repair the damage caused by the capsule			1
dr @entity81 said : ' it really is only good fortune that we have n't seen a death resulting from this type of injury			0
' it is important parents realise that these liquid capsules are dangerous chemicals and they should be kept locked away so children ca n't reach them			1
they must be stored safely at all times , out of reach and sight of young children			0
' wherever possible and , as with all household cleaning products and bleaches , they should be stored in a locked cupboard or in a cupboard that can not be accessed by children			0
' five toddlers aged under two have been admitted to the @entity21 in @entity22 this year after possibly mistaking the capsules for jelly sweets dangers : experts are calling for more childproof containers for the capsules to protect inquisitive youngsters @entity151 ended up calling an ambulance for her seven - month - old daughter @entity153 who ate the contents of a tablet			1
@entity153 was rushed to intensive care and spent 10 days in hospital			0
' @entity153 was at my sister 's house playing with my two - year - old nephew who managed to get hold of one of these liquitabs			1
he thought it was a sweetie because it was bright and like a jelly , so he gave it to @entity153 who bit into it , " ms @entity151 said			0
' immediately we realised there was a problem as she was going in and out of consciousness , so phoned an ambulance right away			0
i 'm just so lucky to still have my little girl			0
' now i make sure that all the liquitabs are locked away and i tell everyone to do the same			0
' the boxes they come in really should be child - proof and i hope manufacturers do something about this as i would n't want this to happen to any other little girl or boy			0
' dr @entity81 and his colleagues have published a letter in the medical journal @entity193 to alert medics and parents to the danger .			0
