@entity0 is a fitness worry for @entity3 ’s quarter - final against @entity4 after @entity5 voiced his annoyance at the ‘ treatment ’ the hosts ’ star man was receiving			1
the 22 - year - old knocked in the winning penalty against @entity12 as they stumbled through a tricky last - 16 tie			1
@entity5 , whose relief at the result was palpable as he spoke about their luck in going through , was angry at the force in which @entity0 has had to deal with			1
heavy knock : @entity0 is a doubt for @entity3 's quarter - final clash against @entity4 on friday night @entity23 quality : the 22 - year - old slotted home the decisive penalty against @entity12 in the last - 16 on saturday breaking down : @entity0 was overwhelmed when the hosts scraped past their @entity29 rivals ‘ we have four or five days to get @entity0 in shape for the next match			1
it is a big problem , his thigh is swollen , ’ he said			2
‘ i remember when i was @entity36 coach and , in the fifth minute of the game , @entity39 defender @entity38 broke @entity40 in half and he had to go off 10 minutes later			2
‘ when i saw @entity0 after the game today i remembered that			2
some people say @entity0 falls too easily			2
’ it had looked for all the world that the hosts would be dumped out of the competition towards the end of a tense extra time when @entity52 thrashed the crossbar , but they – largely thanks to the heroics of goalkeeper @entity55 – rolled on to the quarter - finals			1
@entity5 freely admits that the shootout win , and indeed the three games preceding that , have n’t been virtuoso performances by any stretch – a pattern that is worrying the @entity64 public			0
that was evident in @entity66 on saturday night , with screeches only matched in volume by gasps as their team lost momentum against a vibrant @entity73 outfit , mirrored by sombre television commentary			0
the head coach is all too aware that they are finding expectation levels tough to deal with and said after the penalty win : ‘ if you do n't exploit the few opportunities you get , you can go out			1
‘ we almost paid the price in the 118th minute when the ball hit the bar			0
‘ we had three or four chances to score a ( second ) goal and did n't do it			0
we had even possession and more shots on goal , but when you do n't score you always run more of a risk			0
’ going through : head coach @entity5 was a relieved man as @entity3 progressed in @entity66 got down low : goalkeeper @entity55 was the hero of the hour after saving two @entity73 penalties @entity94 breathe a sigh of relief @entity55 – who was captured in tears even before the spot - kicks were taken - was n’t quite as pragmatic as his boss in the aftermath , although did reiterate the enormous weight dumped at the door of the squad			1
he said : ‘ we had a good first half and created a lot of chances			0
after the equaliser @entity12 came into the game and made life hard for us			1
all we can do is thank the fans and our team - mates for keeping the faith			2
‘ there 's huge pressure in representing our country , and it was tough on a psychological and emotional level			0
i got very emotional four years ago , and today i was crying again , but this time out of happiness			0
‘ not many people know what i 've been through , but i knew my international career was n't over			0
we 've got three more steps to go now and i want to see @entity3 celebrating			1
that 's my big dream			0
