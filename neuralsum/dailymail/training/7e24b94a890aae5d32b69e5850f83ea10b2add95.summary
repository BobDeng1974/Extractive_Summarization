by @entity0 dr @entity1 undertook surgery to reduce the size of a woman 's labia - but was accused of female genital mutilation after it went terribly wrong a doctor whose ‘ designer vagina ’ operation went so wrong that he was accused of female genital mutilation has been cleared			1
dr @entity1 undertook surgery to reduce the size of a woman ’s labia because ‘ it was ugly ’ , but the 33 - year - old was left ‘ distraught ’ by the results , the @entity13 tribunal heard			1
the @entity19 , who is surgically trained , mistakenly removed almost all of the vaginal lips , but did not cause damage to the clitoris , the @entity18 found			0
the @entity25 had alleged the anatomical result was ‘ equivalent to female genital mutilation '			1
the fitness to practise panel found the anatomical result of the procedure could be said ‘ to be equivalent to @entity32 ’ , but cleared dr @entity1 of the charge as he did not intend to perform the operation on the woman , known only as @entity37 chair dr @entity38 said : ‘ the panel has not been provided with any evidence during the course of these proceedings to suggest that you set out to remove all or virtually all of @entity45 ’s labia minora			1
‘ it has not been provided with any cultural or surgical reasons as to why you would do this			0
‘ in your evidence you stated that you were totally against the practice of @entity32 and would not have any reason to carry it out			1
‘ in the light of your character and the testimony you gave the panel accepts this			0
’ dr @entity1 admitted performing labiaplasty on the @entity60 woman at @entity62 ’s @entity61 on march 8 , 2012			1
he told the panel that she was unhappy with the appearance and was suffering discomfort and pain from sitting down and wearing tight clothes			0
‘ there was nothing unusual about this procedure , there was nothing unusual about this patient and there was nothing unusual about this operation , ’ he said giving evidence			2
asked if he had intended to perform @entity32 , he replied : ‘ i am very much against it			1
‘ i have never done it and i do n’t think i would ever do it and i did n’t intend to perform it on this patient			2
’ he added : ‘ every time when a medical intervention is done by a doctor with all due care , vigilance and manual dexterity , one may still come across these events where the outcome of a procedure is something not expected and contrary and i do n’t think any doctor enjoys it			2
dr @entity1 mistakenly removed almost all of the vaginal lips , but did not cause damage to the woman 's clitoris , the tribunal heard the doctor denied he had removed all of the inner labia , but the panel found against him , determining that it amounted to a ‘ serious clinical failure ’			1
dr @entity38 said : ‘ your evidence was that the complete excision of the labia minora did not happen in the course of the operation			2
‘ on this point it preferred the evidence of the clinicians and the experts			0
‘ as a result , the conclusion the panel has reached is that the procedure did in fact result in the almost complete excision of the labia minora			2
‘ therefore , it has found this paragraph proved on the basis advanced by the @entity25 , namely that what you did amounted to a serious clinical failure			0
’ after the operation , the woman contacted her gp and later emergency services because she was ‘ distressed and unhappy ’ , self - harming and suffering from suicidal thoughts			1
the @entity25 had alleged the anatomical result was ' equivalent to female genital mutilation ' ( file picture ) dr @entity1 was reported to the @entity25 later that month on the basis that the woman felt ‘ violated and butchered ’ and had been ‘ railroaded into the surgery , ’ the hearing was told			1
patient a was examined by a number of doctors over the following months , but was referred to a specialist @entity32 clinic in july last year , after she became pregnant			2
with regards to the allgation that the operation amounted to femle genital mutilation , @entity153 , for the @entity25 , told the panel it should only find the charge proved if the doctor had intended to perform such an operation			1
mr @entity158 told the panel the procedure had lessened the woman 's sexual sensitivity , adding : ' was this mere negligence ? no. did it amount to serious professional misconduct ? yes			2
' but @entity167 , defending , argued that a single clinical error along with admitted recording keeping deficiencies was not enough for the panel to reach a finding of misconduct against the doctor			0
' i would not want anyone to think i am trivialising the outcome of this surgery , ' he said			0
' in considering the gravity it is important to remove it from the emotive context of female genital mutilation			1
' mr @entity167 told the panel that an arm operation resulted in the loss of feeling to the hand it would not constitute misconduct , and said : ' neither should you view this isolated function as such			0
' he added : ' coming at the end of a long and distinguished career , these proceedings have been a painful , extended and salutary ordeal for @entity197 and i can tell you he has no desire to return to gynaecological surgery either at the @entity61 or anywhere else			0
' it was also alleged that the gp was not qualified to carry out the operation because he had only worked as a gynaecologist for six months , 25 years earlier			0
but he was cleared of the charge after he told the panel he had worked part - time at the private clinic since around 1994 and took a greater role after the owner died in 2011 , although he said he was never paid for his services			0
he could also still face sanctions over the bungled operation and admitted record keeping errors if the panel finds his errors amounted to serious misconduct			0
labia reduction or labiaplasty is the most common type of genital surgery carried out in the @entity225			0
although widely practised , cosmetic genital surgery or ‘ designer vagina ’ surgery has been criticised by experts who say it is risky and often unnecessary			0
dr @entity1 is currently subject to an interim conditional @entity25 order , originally imposed in july last year , which restricts the work he is allowed to carry out			1
the string of conditions keeps him closely monitored by the @entity25 as well as banning him from carrying out female genital operations			1

dr @entity1 performed labiaplasty on 33 - year - old woman
procedure went *horribly* wrong and the woman was left suicidal
was alleged the result was ‘ equivalent to female genital mutilation '
@entity248 agreed , but he was cleared as had not intended to perform @entity32
