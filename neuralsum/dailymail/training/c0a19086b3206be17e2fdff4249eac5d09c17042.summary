by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:54 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 14:42 est , 25 march 2013 a vast @entity3 estate that had fallen into ruin after its @entity6 heir abandoned the land can finally be divided among relatives after 80 years of legal wrangling			2
the @entity11 estate in @entity12 , with its enormous manor house set in 3,000 acres of lush @entity15 countryside worth $ 7.5million , has been inherited by two elderly sisters in @entity17			1
however the women 's cousin and next male heir - the only person who wanted to restore the estate to its former glory - has been left with a vastly reduced sum because of a change to the century - old will			1
the estate , with its 19th - century @entity28 manor house , belonged to the @entity11 family who first moved to the property in 1856			1
inheritance : @entity6 heir @entity32 ( left ) never accepted his right to the @entity15 estate but this blocked the land being claimed by his cousin , @entity36 ( right ) , a retired farmer from @entity38 after decades of being handed down to ancestors , @entity39 had been unclaimed for 40 years			1
the rightful heir @entity32 lived for a short time on the land in @entity12 in the 1960s but later returned to @entity17 because the legal issue of entailment had not been settled			1
@entity32 never indicated to the @entity3 @entity45 that he wanted to accept @entity46 after the death of his father @entity48 in 1965			1
it meant the estate , close to the village of @entity52 , was prevented from passing to the second - in - line , his cousin and only male heir , @entity36			2
the century - old will had a clause which said the estate must pass to the next male heir which was mr @entity61			1
the retired farmer and father - of - four from @entity38 said that wanted to live and work on the family estate , restoring it to its former glory and becoming a pillar of the community			1
the @entity3 courts recognized mr @entity61 as a legitimate heir			0
worth millions : @entity32 , pictured as a younger man			2
the @entity17 stood to inherit a vast @entity15 estate but ignored it and died impoverished in his eighties however because of the legal impasse , @entity39 lay empty			1
over the years , the mansion fell into disrepair after lying empty and unloved while the land and gardens became overgrown			0
parts of the estate were sold off to pay death duties and administration costs			2
the estate , which has shrunk to 1,000 acres , is still valued at £ 5million			2
@entity32 had a phd in marine biology from the prestigious @entity90			1
he worked as a marine biologist and held a post at @entity93 in @entity17			1
he also served in the military during @entity95			0
mr @entity32 opted for a low - key existence with his sister @entity97 in @entity17 , traveling around in an old rv			1
the brother and sister lived an organic lifestyle and were involved in farmer 's markets in @entity17			1
at one point , there were claims that the pair had been evicted from a trailer park in @entity109 , where they were living in two trucks after failing to pay $ 200 rent			0
cut out : @entity36 , pictured with his wife , visits the estate which he was due to inherit as the only male heir before changes to the will cut him out mr @entity32 died on june 12 , 2011 at the age of 85 after being placed in a nursing home			1
his death allowed the destiny of the estate to be decided by a judge at the @entity123 in @entity124			2
the century - old will was rewritten as if @entity32 were in his right mind to settle the century - long impasse			1
an original clause which said the estate would pass to a male heir was cut out and the sale proceeds of the estate split between @entity32 's next - of - kin , his elderly sisters in @entity17			1
his sister @entity135 , who is believed to be in a nursing home , and @entity137 , are to share the million - dollar inheritance from the sale of @entity39 after legal and doctors bills are paid			2
falling down : this derelict remains of the 19th century @entity28 manor house on the @entity11 estate in @entity12 the @entity11 estate near @entity145 in @entity12 , was once an impressive country pile of 3,000 acres , a manor house , farms , houses and woods			1
the estate sits close to @entity52 , an idyllic but sleepy country parish			2
the @entity11 family first moved into @entity154 in 1856			1
then it was alive with the hustle and bustle of servants , horse - drawn carriages and the local gentry			2
after decades of abandonment , it is now little more than a tumbled - down ruin , encased in ivy and inhabited by rooks			0
they are expected to receive £ 1.3million ( close to $ 2million ) each			0
only £ 130,000 ( around $ 200,000 ) will go to the closest surviving male heir , @entity61 , their cousin			0
it was thought @entity32 , who is thought to have visited the property in the 1960s , had disputed paying death duties in @entity15 and would not sign legal documents			1
@entity3 's @entity174 , who deals with such property matters , tried in vain to contact @entity32 about his vast inheritance 30 years ago			1
in 1985 , the @entity174 wrote : ‘ @entity32 , by the stroke of a pen and by meeting some other details , can take over the property			1
' yet i do not know his address			0
’ impressive building : this archive photo from the 1930s shows @entity187 in all its pride on the @entity11 estate the history of @entity39 has long been marked with scandal and family tragedy			1
in 1856 , @entity193 was the first to move into @entity187			0
he lived there in grandeur with his wife , son and four daughters			0
@entity199 , @entity200 however their idyllic life came to be tainted by a bitter legal battle surrounding @entity193 's will			0
the estate , according to legal documents drawn up by a previous owner , was intended to pass to the eldest male heir			2
however @entity193 also wanted his daughters to share in the property			0
however @entity11 's eldest son @entity211 , a known heavy drinker , challenged the legal changes while his father was still alive			2
@entity211 lost the battle against his sisters soon after his father died and shortly before his own early death			0
the @entity12 estate was then thrown into turmoil			1
with only four @entity222 daughters left - all spinsters and with no male heir - no one could inherit the house and lands			2
two remained spinsters and one married but did not have children			0
and the fourth sister scandalized local society with her love life			0
crumbling : this picture shows the stable block at @entity187 on the estate in @entity12 when she was 20 , she ran off to @entity236 with coachman @entity237 who was in his thirties and married with four sons			1
@entity240 soon regretted her actions			0
ancestor : @entity243 @entity193 is pictured with three of his children - @entity211 , @entity245 and @entity240 - in the 1860s			0
he moved into @entity28 in 1856 the @entity247 reported in april 1882 : ‘ the unfortunate girl ’s story was a pitiful one			0
' she wished herself back home within 24 hours of leaving , and left her swain distinguishing himself as a waiter at an hotel			0
’ her parents were on the dockside to greet her on her return to @entity258 , @entity259			0
she found a more suitable partner in naval officer @entity261 , a tea broker 's son , and they married in march 1884			0
the couple moved to @entity264 , @entity265 and then to @entity17 , and their four children took the surname @entity268			2
@entity240 ’s eldest son @entity270 , a gold miner in @entity17 , was due to take over the estate on the deaths of his mother and @entity12 aunts			1
in 1947 , he visited the estate and invited the tenant farmers to a meeting at @entity52 to announce his intention of restoring the estate to its former glory			0
however @entity48 was annoyed that his elderly aunts had let the estate become run down			0
he would not sign a document saying that he was satisfied the estate and would take it on			0
he returned to @entity17 and died in 1965			2
the estate then passed to his eldest son @entity32 where the legal wranglings continued until this year			1
seen now : @entity32 's sisters @entity135 , who is now thought to be in care , and @entity137 , are to share the £ 5million estate , once all the land and properties are sold and the legal , doctors ' and rest home bills paid @entity199 , vice-chairman of @entity200 said recently that he was delighted the long - running will dispute was finally settled			1
he said it gave a chance for the estate to be rejuvenated			0
mr @entity199 said that just before @entity302 , @entity301 , a distant cousin of @entity32 , addressed @entity200 with plans to open a new campsite on part of the estate he had just bought			1
that plan will be subject to planning approval from @entity309			0
‘ most people have forgotten the estate is there because the dispute went on so long , ' mr @entity199 added			0
but i think locals will be pleased to know it 's finally been settled			0
