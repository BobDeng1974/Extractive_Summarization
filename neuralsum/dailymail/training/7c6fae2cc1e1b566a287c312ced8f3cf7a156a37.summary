@entity1 city has ruled out a proposed ' bed tax ' on tourists for the second time after a cool response from the @entity5 and local hotels			1
local authorities contacted @entity9 ministers to discuss a voluntary ' transient visitor levy ' which would impose an additional fee for every night 's stay in @entity1			1
but concern over the reliability of income and whether enough hotels , b&bs and guest houses would sign up saw the plan stall			0
@entity1 city chiefs scrapped plans to tax tourists visiting the city extra per night for the second time a proposal of a compulsory tax - which would have added between £ 1 and £ 2 per night to a room bill - were backed by the council in 2011 and they say up to £ 10 million could have been raised for festivals , venues and conference centres			1
the tax , however , would have needed new legislation to pass through the @entity33 and ministers were n't responsive to a potential backlash against the move			0
city officials are now considering whether to create a @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , which would see hotels pay levies to fund urban improvements			0
@entity43 , chairman at the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , said : ' the compulsory tourist levy was dropped as it was not deemed a fair , suitable and efficient way to raise additional funding			1
funds raised from the ' bed tax ' would have raised money for local festivals and venues ' those same reasons still apply to the business environment today and it is difficult to see how a voluntary scheme would be feasible or desirable by members of @entity44			1
' we would also worry that this additional cost could make @entity1 even less price competitive as a destination to travellers on top of some of the highest vat taxes and @entity66 in @entity67			0
' but festival promoters said it was unlikely large numbers of high - paying overseas tourists would be put off by a bed tax , particularly during the @entity73			2
@entity74 is considering a similar fee but @entity76 has urged against it @entity77 , director of @entity78 said : ' i think it might have a deleterious effect on the weekend break market , particularly in the off - peak months			2
' but in terms of peak demand , i do n't think it would present a great barrier compared to the considerable charges already being levied , and it creates a pot of money that 's ring - fenced for visitor improvements			0
' council finance leader @entity92 , said : ' the idea of a voluntary @entity94 has now been ruled out , however @entity95 continues to explore options around a @entity39 for the city			0

@entity1 ' bed tax ' has been shelved after talks with @entity9 government
a voluntary ' transient visitor levy ' was proposed but deemed *unfair*
ministers and the @entity44 *reject* the proposal
it follows the axing of plans for a compulsory tourist levy in 2011 that was to be brought in to raise money for local festivals and venues
comedy club director @entity77 said peak period visitors would n't mind however the weekend market may take *exception* to the fee
