@entity1 fans hoping for a return to free - flowing attacking football under new manager @entity4 might have felt a little uneasy at the sight of the @entity7 coach playing with a back six at times against @entity10			1
the threat of @entity12 was clearly at the forefront of @entity15 ’s plans for the @entity17 semi-final showdown in the @entity18			0
@entity15 ’s tactics worked to a degree as @entity21 shut out the @entity23 attack in a largely uninspiring semi-final but the @entity7 side lost out in a penalty shoot - out			1
but @entity1 fans , who were fed a constant diet of entertaining football under sir @entity30 , will be hoping the new boss does n’t resort to negative tactics at @entity33			0
@entity15 ’s new assistant coach @entity55 was at @entity56 on monday for what was officially the first day of pre-season following medical and fitness tests last week , along with several other members of his @entity7 coaching staff			2
