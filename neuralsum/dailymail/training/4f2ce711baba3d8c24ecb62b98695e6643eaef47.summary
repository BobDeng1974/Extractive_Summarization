but can @entity1 brag that they are the kings of the @entity15 ? scroll down to find out which club are the champions of the capital			2
their top spot is safe , however , as they are six points ahead of @entity1 in the all - time table , having won 110 of their 209 derbies			1
@entity9 's club have won 107 of their 209 but can make that 108 on thursday in north @entity6 , where an old rivalry could be reignited between @entity38 and @entity39			1
the @entity0 centre back , while with @entity41 , got into a scuffle with @entity39 while the striker was at @entity44 , resulting in the defender punching the man he was marking in the stomach			0

@entity0 are some way behind in third in the all - time table on 263 points , having won just 66 of their 209 derbies			1
down at the bottom , though , it 's not good news for @entity57 or @entity58			0
they have 52 and 70 points , respectively , though they have played far less @entity6 derbies than the rest			2
the old rivalry between @entity0 defender @entity38 and @entity1 striker @entity39 will be reignited on @entity3 - here the then @entity41 centre half punches the then @entity44 centre forward ( left ) @entity66 ( left ) has been @entity0 's star , while @entity67 has been a key man for @entity68 in the 2014 table , though , @entity1 come out on top with 25 points			1
