by @entity0 ' no ' : sir @entity1 has become one of the most high - profile celebrities to back the ' no ' campaign sir @entity1 has become one of the most high - profile celebrities yet to back the campaign against @entity10 independence by demanding : ' @entity11			1
' the former @entity12 – who wrote @entity13 in tribute to the remote part of @entity10 where he owns a farm – has signed an open letter calling on voters to choose @entity19 in next month 's referendum			1
his intervention , announced at a rally in his home @entity23 , came as @entity25 admitted that he was ' emotional and nervous ' about the result of the ballot in just 18 days ' time			1
the letter signed by sir @entity1 , along with other public figures including sir @entity32 , professor @entity33 and sir @entity34 , declares : ' we want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you , and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them			1
' it adds : ' what unites us is much greater than what divides us			0
' tv historian @entity45 , one of the campaign co-ordinators for @entity47 , said at the event in @entity23 : ' sir @entity1 is one of the world 's most respected musicians			1
we are humbled that he has signed the letter			2
' sir @entity1 's signature , alongside sir @entity32 's and those of tens of thousands of people from all over the country , shows that @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity59 people hope passionately that the @entity10 vote to renew their bonds of citizenship with us			1
' the song @entity13 , featuring the local @entity65 pipe band , was the @entity67 no 1 in 1977 and became the first single to sell two million copies in the @entity70			1
sir @entity1 bought @entity71 in 1966 when he was living with actress @entity72 , before turning it into a family home with his fist wife @entity75			1
he has said that he was inspired by the ' wandering single - track roads and sense of solace ' of the 600 - acre estate to write @entity80			0
anti-independence campaigner : tv presenter @entity45 ( pictured ) gathers support in @entity23 at the announcement that sir @entity1 is backing their cause yesterday mr @entity25 admitted to being worried about the referendum after a poll last week showed that no campaign 's lead has been cut in half to just six points			1
the poll followed a second televised debate between first minister @entity94 and better together campaign leader @entity95 in which mr @entity94 emerged on top			0
the prime minister said : ' i 'm emotional and nervous because it matters so much			2
' but he insisted that there was a ' silent majority ' of people who were afraid to admit to their support for the union ' because they worry about retribution from the @entity10 government '			2
poster boy : the @entity47 blog proudly parades @entity1 on their site after he signed their open letter sir @entity1 's intervention led to predictable blizzard of song puns			1
@entity119 mp @entity118 , a no supporter , said : ' we are glad to have the help ! of sir @entity1			1
it is hardly surprising that sir @entity1 wants us to come together			1
maybe rather than trying to take us all on a @entity123 , @entity94 should just let it be			0
' a spokesman for the pro-independence camp said : ' it 's fantastic that sir @entity1 loves @entity10 , and we 're sure he will continue to do so after @entity10 say , '' yeah , yeah , yeah ''			1
the case for @entity128 is a democratic one – as far as @entity10 is concerned the @entity130 system belongs to yesterday , and independence will be good for the @entity13 and all of @entity10			1
yes is definitely the best @entity132			0
' sir @entity1 's spokesman declined to comment			1
with just over a couple of weeks to go to an event where a small minority of a nation could well destroy my country without any participation from the majority ( some exercise in democracy , that ) , i just want to address two things that still trouble me			0
firstly , independence from what exactly ? at the last general election , the @entity148 polled 17 per cent of the popular vote and the @entity151 polled 20 per cent – just three points more			0
braveheart fiction : former trade minister @entity154 claims a small minority could destroy @entity10 so just as those in the @entity157 say they want to be free of rule by the hated @entity160 of @entity130 , what about those @entity10 conservatives and many more non-tories who can not abide @entity94 's snake oil ? why should they be enslaved by an ideology that means not just that they will have a government they have to tolerate for the next five years , but that they will become unwilling citizens for ever in a new country they did n't even want to exist ? is it independence to share the pound but have no influence in the decisions concerning interest rates ? is it independence to be punished severely by the markets ( with higher debt - service costs ) for defaulting on @entity10 's share of the deficit ? @entity154 suggests it 's arrogant of @entity94 to expect the @entity187 will carry on acting as a monarch for @entity10 as well secondly : how will the rest of the @entity70 respond if the tartan turkeys do indeed vote for @entity67 on september 18 ? i do hope we will not roll over and give an independent @entity10 the fuzzy partnership of allowing them to cherry - pick all the best bits of the old @entity70 ( including @entity197 – how arrogant of mr @entity94 just to assume she will still be their @entity187			1
has anyone asked her ? )			0
we must not take the @entity201 punch on the chin , letting it be ' business as usual '			0
so yes , let 's have proper border controls			2
given they wo n't be in the @entity207 from the start ( @entity209 will see to that , given they wo n't want a rampant @entity212 on their hands ) , let 's make everyone north of the border apply for a visa			2
until @entity10 becomes part of the @entity207 , someone resident in @entity10 seeking to come and live in @entity56 should be treated just the same as someone resident in @entity221			2
no they ca n't just decide unilaterally to share our currency ... they wanted this divorce , not us			0
mr @entity94 is like the husband seeking a divorce against the will of his wife but saying he 's keeping all the best bits of the matrimonial home			2
we will not build our warships in a foreign country so the @entity236 and @entity237 shipyards will close , for starters			0
just explain that to the good men and women who have built our warships there for centuries but will now be looking for the enhanced welfare payments promised by the nationalists			0
how will independence pay for those ? increased taxes ? public - spending cuts ? and most of all , when the oil price is cyclically against them , when the financial services community has left town , when the independent @entity10 are faced with cutting public services and putting up taxes , when the @entity10 at last awake from their @entity259 dream and will take no more , i do so hope that the new , @entity260 of @entity56 , @entity57 & @entity59 will not use my and others ' taxes to bail out the new @entity260 of @entity10			2
no one gave us a say in this matter so it will not be our problem to solve			0
@entity268 is for ever ; it is n't something you can change at the next election if you do n't like it			0
it is n't something you can call a day on			0
every braveheart voting with his or her heart will be stuck with it			0
it 's about running a country , mr @entity94 , not taking part in a @entity284 fiction			2
@entity285 is business ambassador at @entity286 .			0
