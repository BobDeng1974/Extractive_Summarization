by @entity0 a mixture of thunderstorms , fires , chemicals and solar flares are thought to have been the catalyst for record levels of radiation detected over @entity9 in 2003			1
researchers from @entity11 believe this combination of events created the ‘ perfect storm ’ of damage to the ozone layer , and caused levels to soar to 43.3 at the region ’s @entity16 volcano			1
the report continued that data collected across the @entity23 show uv anomalies such as this could increase - and if they do it could lead to more radiation entering our atmosphere			1
in december 2003 , a record uv index of 43.3 was detected at @entity9 's @entity16 volcano			1
researchers believe thunderstorms , fires in the @entity36 , chemicals from @entity33 and a solar flare combined to deplete the ozone layer and let harmful rays through			1
this spike is pictured in white around the @entity23 on 29 december 2003 , a radiation detector , known as a dosimeter , fitted to the top of the volcano recorded uv - b radiation level of 43.3			1
although this spike was initially put down to detection error , two dosimeters placed more than 6 miles ( 10 km ) apart saw the same peaks at the same time			0
on 4 november 2003 , the largest solar flare ever recorded exploded from the @entity53 's surface , sending an intense burst of radiation streaming towards the @entity56			1
before the storm peaked , x-rays overloaded the detectors on the @entity60 ( goes ) , forcing scientists to estimate the flare 's size			2
the biggest previous solar flare on record was rated as an @entity66 , on 2 april 2001 and 16 august 1989			1
by comparison , the strongest solar flare of 2014 , which released radiation into space at 4.4 million mph in february , was an @entity71			2
the high for the volcano , and the @entity74 in general across @entity75 , @entity9 and @entity76 is 25			1
by comparison , the average uv levels in @entity78 reach only nine during the summer , with a high of 13 being spotted in @entity81 and @entity82			2
a high of 12 is seen as dangerous to people ’s skin and eyes , according to the @entity87			0
the @entity23 receives higher levels because of its elevation , naturally lower ozone levels and tropical sun. but this latest research claims these levels soared due to a rare combination of factors that destroyed the @entity56 ’s protective layer , which typically blocks the sun ’s radiation			2
this included seasonal thunderstorms over the @entity23 , fires in the @entity36 , ozone - depleting chemicals from @entity33 and a large solar flare that was emitted the month before the spike			1
the @entity23 and the @entity16 ( pictured ) receives higher levels because of its elevation , naturally lower ozone levels and tropical sun. but , the latest research claims these levels soared due to a rare combination of factors that destroyed the @entity56 's protective layer , which typically blocks the sun 's radiation this chart reveals the different radiation levels spotted on @entity9 's @entity16 volcano in january 2004 - two weeks after the spike			1
before the solar flare in november , levels were around 20			2
by january 17 it reached 30 and researchers state this is evidence that the solar flare made an impact on radiation ‘ the solar flare is the big question mark here , ’ researcher @entity122 , a planetary scientist at the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , told @entity126			2
these images plot total ozone layer levels on 10 , 15 and 17 january			0
purple areas show where the column amount decreased ‘ the major spikes in @entity136 pretty much match exactly with this major solar activity			0
’ the discovery was made as the researchers were trying to identify environments in the @entity23 that were similar to those found on @entity142			0
other contributing factors may also include elevated levels of water transported from the troposphere into the stratosphere at very low temperatures			0
‘ although the evidence is circumstantial , an @entity150 class solar flare also took place on november 4 , 2003 , becoming the largest event ever recorded with instruments , ’ explained the researchers			1
‘ solar particle events have been shown to affect atmospheric chemistry and foster ozone depletion			0
' our instruments were deployed two weeks after the @entity150 flares and showed the most extreme uv variability between the time of their deployment and the end of march 2004			0
‘ the coincidental timing of the historical solar activity with seasonal uv maximum , and weather pattern that brings atmospheric instability over the @entity23 may have been additional factors that could have contributed to the generation of these unprecedented record values			1
’ the results were published in the journal frontiers in @entity176			0
recent models suggest that tropical stratospheric ozone will slightly decrease in the coming decades , potentially resulting in more uv anomalies			0
if they become more common , the researchers explained that events of this magnitude may have societal and ecological implications			0
the spike was so extreme , it was initially put down to detection error			0
but two dosimeters placed more than 6 miles ( 10 km ) apart saw the same peaks at the same time			0
this image shows the location of the dosimeter on the volcano , and one on the nearby @entity193			0

in december 2003 , a world - record uv index of 43.3 was detected in @entity9
it was recorded by a dosimeter fitted to the top of the @entity16 volcano
the high for the @entity23 region across @entity75 and @entity9 is around 25
this uv index is used to forecast the *strength* of the sun 's *ultraviolet* rays
study *blames* combination of seasonal thunderstorms , fires in the @entity36 , chemicals from @entity33 and a solar flare for the increase in radiation
