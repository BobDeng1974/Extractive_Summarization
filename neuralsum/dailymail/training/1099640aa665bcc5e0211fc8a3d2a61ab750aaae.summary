@entity2 winger @entity1 's stunning lob against @entity3 was all in vain as the @entity5 lost 5 - 3 against the @entity6 , but despite this have we already seen the goal of the season ? the @entity12 's sumptuous lob midway during the first half put @entity2 2 - 0 up as they seemingly looked like cruising to victory , with the former @entity16 winger impressing for @entity18 's side throughout proceedings			1
after picking up the ball just past the halfway line the 26 - year - old linked up well with @entity2 captain @entity20 , who in turn laid the ball back to @entity23 before he took matters into his own hands			1
@entity20 looks to move the ball forward for @entity2 as they look to double their lead @entity1 collects the ball for @entity2 and gets it on to his favoured left foot @entity23 brings the ball further towards goal as the winger looks to extend @entity2 's lead @entity23 makes the perfect connection with the ball with his left foot with @entity39 out of his goal @entity23 got the ball on to his left foot before advancing with the ball and then drifting into the penalty area			2

@entity23 is no stranger to goals like this scoring an equally impressive goal for @entity53 in an emphatic friendly win over @entity57 winners @entity55 earlier this month			0
@entity23 's ball floats up in air as opposition players and his @entity2 team - mates look on @entity39 can only look on as the ball floats over his net and looks set to double @entity2 's lead @entity23 makes the perfect connection with his left foot as @entity2 double their lead @entity23 is one of only two players to score a direct free - kick this season , scoring with a 35 - yard free - kick on his home debut for @entity2 in the 4 - 0 win over @entity73 last sunday , with @entity74 also scoring an impressive free - kick for the latter in a 2 - 2 draw with @entity78 on saturday			2
