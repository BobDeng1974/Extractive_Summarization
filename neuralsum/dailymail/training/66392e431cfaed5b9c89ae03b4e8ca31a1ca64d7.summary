the tiny @entity8 , from @entity9 , is just 10mm long when fully grown , and its tiny babies are only 2mm long and almost invisible to the naked eye			1
the creatures is also transparent , allowing to see the fish 's internal organs			1
the tiny @entity8 from @entity9 ( pictured ) is just 10mm long when fully grown , and its tiny babies are so small they are almost invisible to the naked eye the fish are found in @entity17 in small shallow muddy streams			1
one recorded habitat is known as @entity20			1
here the water has a ph of 7.2 and is medium - hard			2
they are found with various barbs and rasboras , and are highly likely to be at the bottom of the food chain due to its size			2
the maximum recorded is 12mm			2
males are larger than females			2
eggs are reported to be 0.5mm in diameter ( relatively large for the size of fish ) , and only a few are laid at any one time			0
their estimated lifespan is 2 - 3 years , but accurate data is still lacking on this			0
staff at the aquarium were amazed when they noticed the tiny babies swimming with their parents in the display tank			1
@entity48 , our @entity49 , told @entity51 : ‘ i am delighted to have the chance to work with this very rare fish			0
' @entity54 is known on the natural breeding cycle and as a team we are working hard to increase our knowledge on the life cycle and breeding habits of this fish , with a view to sharing our findings with other public aquariums and researchers			0
’ mr @entity48 added : ' their size and the fact that in the wild they live in a small area makes them particularly vulnerable to environmental change			0
' the creatures , which are just 2mm long when hatched , are also transparent , revealing the fish 's internal organs staff at the aquarium were amazed when they noticed the tiny babies swimming with their parents in the display tank ' establishing a viable breeding populationwill help secure their survival			1
' found in @entity17 in small shallow muddy streams , the tiny @entity8 eggs are reported to be 0.5mm in diameter			1
only a few are laid at any one time and the fish 's estimated lifespan is two to three years			0
' due to their scarcity , little is known about their breeding habits , ' said @entity91 , curator at the @entity92			0
' @entity93 has been assisting with our breeding programme , and we are continuing to record breeding habits to increase knowledge on the species			0

@entity1 in @entity2 successfully bred @entity8
creatures are also transparent , allowing you to see internal organs
when hatched , babies are just 2mm long almost invisible to the naked eye
