a recent survey has revealed that more than half of @entity3 children do n't have any veg , and 44 per cent have no fruit on a daily basis			1
with childhood obesity on the rise in the @entity3 , these new figures are incredibly alarming			1
for more than two decades , i 've been in the business of helping children get their daily fill of fruit and veg			1
so i wanted to share some of my feeding wisdom to help encourage healthier , happier children			1
it 's easy to become locked in a battle of wills when it comes to dishing up healthy , nutritious food			2
@entity23 has shred her tips on how to make children love eating vegetables my son was a very fussy eater , so i had to think of ingenious ways to ensure he was getting a wholesome balanced diet whilst enjoying what he was eating			1
truth be told , ninety percent of children go through at least one lengthy stage of fussy eating			1
it 's so easy to feel frustrated and powerless when your child simply refuses to eat certain foods			1
but the key is not to give in or give up			2
day in , day out , i persisted with new healthy foods , new recipes and creative ways to hide the good bits my son did n't like			1
in fact , it was coming up with these new and novel recipes that inspired me to create my very first book – @entity49 and @entity50			0
while it can be frustrating when a child rejects the food we give them , it 's actually the way that we deal with the situation that impact on their eating habits			1
it 's not ideal to let your child get away with not eating certain foods in order to keep the peace			1
giving your children a limited number of foods will only escalate their fussiness , and deprive them of the essential nutrients they need to grow and develop			1
if i am honest , hiding the good bits in a meal did n't always get past my children , but i found it really important to hide my frustrations			1
instead , i gave them lots of praise when they ate well or tried something new			0
remember , you are not alone ! keep trying out new ideas and eventually you will see positive results			0
do n't be afraid to quiz other mums on how they get their children eating healthy food			1
i used to share my recipes at my son 's nursery and it felt so good to be able to help other mums in my position			0
@entity23 says that parents should keep trying out new ideas with their children and eventually they will see positive results when it comes to a healthy diet tips for helping kids towards their five - a - day 1			1
try making your own healthy junk food using good quality lean meat for burgers , @entity98 muffins for pizza bases and a good way to coat homemade fish fingers is to dip them in seasoned flour , beaten egg and crushed cornflakes			0
for dessert it 's easy to make fresh fruit ice lollies from fruit juice and pureed fruits			1
some kids can spot a hidden mushroom a mile off , so sometimes the best thing is to be up front about fruit and vegetables , tell them where they come from and why they are so good for you			2
giving them facts could make them more interested about what they are eating			2
i used to offer a starter - a little teacup or saucer of something new that they could try that would be in addition to their main meal			0
if your child refuses to eat anything other than junk food , do n't worry			1
they will soon find there 's not much point making a fuss if you do n't react			2
without going to unnecessary lengths , try to make sure your child 's food not only tastes good but looks good too			1
make mini portions in ramekins , make chicken skewers or thread bite sized pieces of fruit onto a straw			2
avoid empty calorie snacks like crisps or soft drinks and keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand – maybe have a low shelf in the fridge with cut up fresh fruit and other healthy foods			2
when children are hungry , they wo n't wait			1
children like to assemble their own food , so you could lay ingredients out in bowls and let your child fill and fold their own wraps or choose their favourite toppings for their home made pizzas			1
most children adore cooking and tasks like squeezing fresh orange juice or cracking eggs are well within the capabilities of a young child			1
it 's amazing how being involved in the planning and preparation of a meal can stimulate a child 's appetite			2
my chilled toddler meals are great for packing in the veggies – especially on those busy days			0
