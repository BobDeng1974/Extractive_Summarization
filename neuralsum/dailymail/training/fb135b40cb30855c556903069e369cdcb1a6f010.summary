by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ there is a stage in the career of every top player when it feels as though they have come of age			2
that time appears to have arrived for @entity9			1
with @entity13 ’s opening game of the @entity14 against @entity15 on the horizon , the @entity11 striker has become the team ’s talisman			1
class act : @entity9 curls home the opener after 32 minutes to put @entity13 on the road to victory the eyes have : @entity9 hit his fourth international goal ahead of @entity13 's flight to @entity26 his goal against @entity28 on friday at @entity29 — his fourth in @entity13 colours — added to his growing reputation within the game			1
@entity9 is handling it all brilliantly , refusing to take anything for granted			1
‘ there are obviously certain players who have their spots nailed down , but in my mind i have n’t and i am working hard every day to show what i can do , ’ @entity9 admitted			1
‘ for me there are no guarantees in football and i will just work hard and not worry about what team the manager will pick			2
i will focus on what i can do for the team and leave the decisions to the boss because that is what he does			0
’ fitness permitting , the 24 - year - old , who has won 11 caps , starts against @entity15 in @entity55			1
@entity9 scored 21 times in the @entity57 for @entity11 and his run of good form has continued for the national team			1
leaving him out for tactical reasons is inconceivable			0
@entity63 connection : @entity9 is congratulated by @entity64 after opening the scoring for @entity13 @entity67 strike ! @entity9 opened the scoring for @entity13 with his fourth international goal ‘ i have n’t thought about my goal against @entity28 — it ’s gone now , ’ he added			1
‘ i ’m not revelling in it , i ’m not worrying about it			0
it ’s about the team , it ’s not just about myself			0
’ every @entity13 team needs someone they can rely on to score goals at vital times and @entity9 is in line to follow some of the greats			1
he has already spoken about @entity83 ’s record as @entity13 ’s second - highest top scorer with 48 goals in 80 matches			1
@entity9 was surprised to learn that @entity87 won the @entity88 with six goals at the 1986 @entity14 in @entity90 and added four more at @entity91			2
then there is @entity95 and his impact at @entity97 98 , or @entity99 ’s four goals at @entity100			0
‘ everyone is desperate to show what they can do and desperate to bring some success , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ i am thankful to the fans for being behind us			0
we understand the magnitude of the task			0
it ’s a big task to go to a @entity14 and have success			0
spot the ball : time stands still after @entity9 unleashed a magnificent effort just after the half hour mark no chance : @entity28 keeper @entity116 clutches at thin air as @entity119 's shot flies into the net ‘ we have a great squad and whatever happens out there in @entity125 we just want to put in the performances that we can be proud of			1
’ at @entity29 on friday , @entity9 ’s left - footed effort beyond @entity28 keeper @entity116 was the highlight of a functional , disciplined 3 - 0 win			1
he has taken the heat off @entity99 at a time when the country is beginning to wonder whether they really will see the best of the @entity135 forward at a @entity14			0
‘ i try not to think about the pressure , it ’s about the team , not just myself and @entity99			0
’ it was a neat answer , but @entity9 ’s importance to this team is increasing with every international			2
@entity142 : questions remain over whether @entity99 and @entity9 can gel for @entity13 smile chaps : @entity145 ( left ) takes a selfie on the team bus alongside @entity9 with @entity148 ( left ) and @entity119 looking on in the background he will be rested on wednesday in @entity26 ’s @entity150 as @entity151 turns to the shadow squad for the warm - up clash with @entity154			1
it is here in @entity157 , with the humidity recorded at 73 per cent yesterday afternoon , where @entity151 hopes to be able to simulate the conditions he will find against @entity15 in @entity55			1
‘ it ’s the next phase and it ’s going to be a lot more difficult in terms of the conditions , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s great preparation and we know it will be even warmer when we get to @entity125			0
friendly : @entity99 and @entity9 meet prince @entity170 following @entity13 's win against @entity28 ‘ it ’s good to have two games in @entity26 to prepare well and train hard			1
we never make excuses about the conditions			0
‘ we have to adapt our style to the conditions			0
you ca n’t always play the way you want to play when it ’s warmer			0
‘ it ’s not about worrying about the heat , the rain or the snow , you just adapt and look to play football regardless			0
’ it will be a different test for @entity13 here and @entity151 is expected to revert to a full - strength team against @entity189 on saturday			2
when he names it , @entity9 will be among the starters .			2
