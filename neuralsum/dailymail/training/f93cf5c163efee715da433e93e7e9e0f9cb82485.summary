by @entity0 published : 02:02 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 23 july 2013 it wo n't be long until the royal baby will be presented to the world but for those who ca n't wait , here 's how one designer predicts the prince of @entity8 will look			1
@entity9 , who founded the website ' @entity10 ' , created his image of the heir to the throne by morphing the faces of the @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity9 , from @entity18 , said his programme takes the key features of each parent and morphs them together to predict the appearance of their off - spring			0
maybe baby : @entity9 created his image of the heir to the throne by morphing the faces of the @entity16 and @entity17 he said : ' on each image focal features like the nose , eyes , mouth and eyebrows are taken and combined to find an average between them			1
that average is then taken from both images and then that average is combined to create the final image			0
' he added that he is ' quite excited to see if my system prediction is right ' now that @entity17 's son is due to be presented to the world			2
@entity9 is n't the first to imagine how the royal baby will look			1
@entity44 - based genetic counsellor @entity43 teamed up with graphic artist @entity45 to reveal how she thinks the child will look as a toddler and a teenager			0
fair : @entity44 - based genetic counsellor @entity43 teamed up with graphic artist @entity45 to reveal how she thinks the child will look as a toddler with pale eyes and blonde hair genetic guess : @entity43 also predicted how the future @entity55 or @entity56 could look as a teen @entity43 based her judgements on the baby taking after prince @entity60 and his mother @entity61 by having blonde hair and blue eyes			1
but the hair could darker as the years pass so the teenager royal bears a stronger resemblance to @entity17			2
meanwhile @entity67 , a @entity68 forensic artist , created images of how he thinks the royal baby will look based upon recent pictures of the @entity16 and @entity17 , and their colouring , predominant genes and outstanding features			1
' bound to be adorable ' : @entity67 , a @entity68 forensic artist , based his prediction on recent pictures of the @entity16 and @entity17 , and their colouring , predominant genes and outstanding features he said he tries to make them as ' cute as possible ' while also being highly scientific			1
he said the future king or queen was bound to be ' adorable ' and added : ' for @entity17 and @entity60 's baby - i think there is a lot of good genes in the mix there			2
' there is a science behind the process			0
the darker features are more dominant with @entity17 's olive skin and dark hair			0
i would say you are not going to get a fair skinned baby with blonde hair and blue eyes - like @entity61			0
' all grown up : @entity97 believes the baby could inherit prince @entity60 's strong nose and @entity17 's dark hair @entity101 , from myvouchercodes.co.uk , and graphic designer @entity103 also created images of how a son or daughter of prince @entity60 and @entity17 could look based on genetic trends			1
they consulted @entity97 , a graduate student from @entity110 - @entity109 , which is dedicated to genetics / genomics research , on what traits the child is likely to inherit from its royal parents			0
she predicted the baby will have blue eyes and a strong nose like @entity119 and @entity60			0
proud parents : the @entity16 and @entity17 welcome their new arrival this week			2
