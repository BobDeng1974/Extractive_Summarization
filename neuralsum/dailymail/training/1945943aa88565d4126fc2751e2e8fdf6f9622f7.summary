by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the fall - out from @entity4 ’s @entity3 fiasco will not include an official @entity6 report into exiting the tournament after two games			1
instead , the @entity6 will review all aspects of the @entity11 experience on a continuous basis building towards @entity13 - but without any special document detailing what went wrong			1
this differs from the approach after the poor show at @entity19 2010 , when the now defunct @entity20 still had power and manager @entity22 delivered a tournament report to them			0
by contrast , the @entity4 group who run the national team have already , in their wisdom , contracted @entity32 to @entity13			0
but even if there is no opposition within the @entity6 to @entity32 remaining in charge , there are sure to be demands that the @entity3 debacle is properly investigated			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity50 president @entity49 has kept such a low profile at the @entity3 - avoiding big - screen appearances at matches to avoid the inevitable booing - that there is speculation he has hardly attended a game			1
however @entity50 say @entity49 has attended seven matches - @entity11 v @entity59 , @entity62 v @entity60 , @entity64 v @entity63 , @entity67 v @entity65 , @entity68 v @entity60 , @entity70 v @entity69 and @entity71 v @entity72			1
meanwhile @entity73 , who is looking increasingly likely to stand against @entity49 for the @entity50 presidency in 2015 , is not taking advantage of his rival staying under cover			2
the @entity78 is not even in @entity11 , although he ’ll return for the quarter - finals			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... there remains frustration in @entity82 that the @entity4 team chose not to make the city their @entity3 base when @entity86 and the @entity87 will have their training camps in @entity82 ahead of the @entity89			2
hotel standards and a lack of attractions for the players compared to @entity94 are understood to be among the reasons for the @entity6 going elsewhere			0
but the @entity96 and the @entity97 are satisfied with their proposed accommodation and @entity100 point to @entity101 , @entity65 and @entity102 , who are all still in the @entity3 , choosing to stay with them			0
low profile : @entity73 ( left ) , who is expected to stand against @entity49 ( right ) for the @entity50 presidency in 2015 , will return to @entity11 for the @entity3 quarter - finals @entity108 , the @entity96 chef de mission for the @entity89 , intends to pick the brain of former colleague @entity111 as to what went pear - shaped with @entity4 ’s @entity3 challenge			1
@entity111 was head of performance services at the @entity96 before joining the @entity6 in the same capacity last february , charged with improving the team ’s record at major championships			0
@entity111 is keen on the back - up of a legion of sports scientists ‘ underpinned with the latest research ’ , which worked for @entity86 in 2012 but definitely did n’t work for the footballers at @entity11 2014			0
@entity125 ’s @entity3 fever the @entity125 might finally be embracing football , judging by the remarkable 18.2million @entity128 viewers for the country ’s 2 - 2 draw with @entity63			1
this was a bigger rating than for any of the recent @entity134 series finals between @entity135 and @entity136			0
@entity128 ’s figures are 36 per cent up on @entity19 2010 , and rivals @entity139 have also enjoyed huge audiences for @entity142 coverage			0
another sign of the way ‘ soccer ’ is finally gripping @entity125 , seven years after @entity146 joined @entity147 , was 10,000 fans watching the @entity63 game on a giant screen in @entity151 , @entity152			2
growing in popularity : @entity125 supporters celebrate after their side scored against @entity63 in @entity156 a notable @entity3 pr coup is the way @entity160 - based agency @entity159 , who represent @entity82 , have milked every publicity opportunity out of 79 - year - old local @entity163 , who was a ball boy when @entity4 were beaten by the @entity125 in 1950			1
the omnipresent @entity163 - there may be more than one of them - apparently turned down being feted by @entity168 and @entity50 at a ball - boy tournament in @entity94 so he could keep pressing the flesh in @entity82 with @entity4 in town .			1

@entity4 's @entity3 failings will not include an official @entity6 report
@entity6 will instead review all aspects of @entity4 's tournament in @entity11
@entity50 president @entity49 has attended seven @entity3 matches despite speculation has *n't* attended a game
18.2million @entity125 tune - in to @entity125 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity63
