@entity1 manager @entity0 accepts his team must solve their @entity4 problems before they escalate any further			1
@entity0 is under no illusions after his side 's desperate home form continued with a shock 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity11 side @entity10 in the @entity12 on wednesday			1
it came after @entity1 lost a club - record 10 @entity15 games on their own turf last term , and were knocked out of the cups by @entity20 and @entity21			1
speaking ahead of sunday 's visit of @entity31 , the @entity42 said : ' the home form is vital to you			1
we 've got to get the home form right			1
wednesday was what cup football is about			0
the chances were there in abundance and we should have won the game , but we were not clinical enough in the final third			0
' this sunday will be a totally different atmosphere from wednesday night			2
' the @entity15 is a fantastic league to play in and if we can do as well as in the last two games and have bit of luck , we will win it			1
the first two league games have been excellent			2
' there will be changes from wednesday - lads are back in the equation			0
what happened on wednesday night ca n't detract from league games although boys are disappointed			2
' embarrassed : @entity1 were beaten by @entity67 in the @entity68 in their last home game after the international break , @entity1 face a daunting run against @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 during september and october			1
they have claimed four points from their opening two games against @entity79 and @entity80 , and @entity0 understands the need for victory ahead of their tough run			1
' if we take three points this weekend , it 'll be seven out of nine , which is a good start , ' he said			0
' we had the same last year , playing @entity73 , @entity72 and @entity74 in a in a week			0
' i prefer them at the start of season than at the end when everyone is in their stride			2
we took points off the big ones last season so what 's not to say we wo n't do it again ? ' incoming ? @entity1 are in talks to sign @entity36 midfielder @entity35 ( @entity101 ) @entity102 ( knee ) and @entity104 ( ankle ) are available while @entity106 ( knee ) is out but expected to return to training next week			2
@entity109 ( @entity110 ) and @entity111 ( broken leg ) are making good progress but are at least a month away from comebacks			0
@entity115 's @entity31 were knocked out of the @entity117 qualifiers by @entity119 side @entity118 on thursday and @entity0 expects a response			1
' @entity115 has a good side and has spent bit money , ' he added			0
' obviously they went down to 10 men against @entity79 last week and , fair play to them , they kept going and got a good point			0
case for the defence : @entity102 ( r ) is available again after recovering from injury ' but i think we 're playing well enough , we 're more solid and have lads to come back - we 're ready for it			0
