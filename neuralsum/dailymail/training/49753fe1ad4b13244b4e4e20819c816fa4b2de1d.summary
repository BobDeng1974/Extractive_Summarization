by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 8 october 2013 an incredible time - lapse video shows the decomposition of a lizard as it is devoured by maggots and beetles until all that is left is its skeleton and tough skin			1
the decomposing creatures was filmed over four - and - a - half weeks and provides a fascinating insight into the process of death			1
cameras took periodic photographs of the decaying animal from the side and as well as the top , while self - confessed ' animal nerd ' @entity18 and camera geek @entity20 , tried to replicate the process of decomposition that would occur in the wild			2
the time - lapse video , by @entity30 , details the five stages of decomposition that begin with fly larvae hatching in the animal 's corpse the creature appears to expand rapidly before the viewers eyes and this swelling is caused as the microbes inside it multiply and respire , which eventually results in the skin rupturing and maggots spilling out ( pictured ) the animal , which died of natural causes , is a savannah monitor lizard , which naturally live in the @entity48 desert put are also popular pets as well as purses			1
the time - lapse video , by @entity30 , details the five stages of decomposition that began with fly larvae hatching in the animal 's corpse			1
to replicate the process in the wild , the two experts inserted fly larvae under the surface of the dead animal 's skin			1
the larvae are one of the ' early starters ' that feed on dead flesh and even faeces			0
the @entity27 monitor lizard ( pictured ) is native to @entity68			1
males can grow up to 5 feet in length but females are much smaller			0
the pattern of coloration of the skin varies according to the local habitat substrate so the creature can hide from predators one the animal 's insides are readily accessible , the stage of active decay begins , when the vast majority of the rotting flesh is eaten by the maggots and the mass of the carcass is greatly reduced the creature appears to expand rapidly before the viewers ' eyes and the swelling of the animal is caused as the microbes inside its body multiply and respire , which eventually results in the skin rupturing and maggots spilling out			0
once the animal 's insides are readily accessible , the stage of active decay begins , when the vast majority of the rotting flesh is eaten by the maggots and the mass of the carcass is greatly reduced			0
around two weeks after the experiment began , and a ' wall of smell ' greeted the experts , the maggots have cleared out all the tissues inside the lizard , leaving behind just a bag of skin and its skeleton			2
at this point in the wild , beetles would begin to feed on the remains of the corpse , so the experts introduced larder beetles , which like the stage of ' dry decay ' to strip the sinew away from the bones			2
in the stage of ' advanced decay , ' the beetles and any remaining microbes pick the skeleton clean , but even they can not feed on the lizard 's skin as it is so tough			0

the process took four - and - a - half weeks from the introduction of fly larvae to just a skeleton and *discarded* skin left behind
