@entity0 is the @entity2 ’s biggest foreign creditor , holding at least £ 794 billion in @entity9 bonds , and its leaders warned @entity11 against jeopardising its huge stake in the @entity2 economy			1
expressing concern over the continuing deadlock in @entity11 about raising the government ’s debt ceiling , @entity0 ’s vice finance minister , @entity14 , said the ' clock was ticking ' for the @entity2 as the world ’s two biggest economies , ' @entity0 and the @entity2 are inseparable , ' he said			1
file picture referring to a similar @entity11 impasse in 2011 that led to the humiliating downgrading of @entity2 ’s credit rating , mr @entity14 said : ' we hope the @entity2 fully understands the lessons of history			1
' the @entity2 has until october 17th to agree to raise its debt ceiling or the @entity9 will run out of money to pay what it owes			1
shares on @entity36 and in @entity37 continued to fall yesterday as the @entity2 government headed into a second week of a partial shutdown with no signs of any agreement over the budget			1
the @entity43 reiterated that president @entity44 will not negotiate with the @entity45 over the threat of a debt default , the first in @entity2 history			1
aides say mr @entity44 believes that negotiating will set a dangerous precedent for future debt ceiling talks			2
protestors holds signs against the government shutdown on the @entity57 of the @entity2 @entity59 building yesterday , mr @entity44 said he believed @entity60 would vote both to reopen government and to raise the debt limit if they did it now			1
' my very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there ' to pass legislation , he said			0
call a vote right now			0
let ’s see what happens			0
' however , the @entity45 control the @entity73			0
and @entity74 house speaker @entity74 vowed on sunday not to raise the @entity2 debt ceiling without a ' serious conversation ' about what is driving the debt			1
with tensions rising in @entity60 , @entity79 countered that their opponents are being irresponsible and reckless to raise the possibility of the @entity2 defaulting			2

@entity43 economic chief @entity101 has suggested that @entity11 could buy some more time to reach a deal if @entity60 approved a bill to boost the debt ceiling for a few weeks			0
conservative republicans in the @entity73 have been accused of holding the @entity2 to ransom by resisting a deal to keep funding the government unless mr @entity44 agrees to delay his healthcare reforms			2
