by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 fell short in her quest for gold at the @entity5 as she lost 2 - 0 to @entity7 's @entity6 in the women 's singles final			1
@entity10 - based @entity1 , the second seed , was unable to impose herself on the third seed at the @entity13 and had to settle for silver as she went down 21 - 14 21 - 6			1
the match , between the players ranked 17th and 19th in the world , was expected to be evenly contested but it proved anything but as @entity1 was outplayed			2
contrasting emotions : @entity6 ( left ) beat @entity1 to win gold in their women 's badminton singles final the 20 - year - old @entity24 slumped to the ground after losing the final point - handing @entity7 a first gold in women 's singles - after 38 minutes			1
afterwards @entity1 admitted her emotionally - draining semi-final win over @entity29 , which she finished in style by reeling off 10 successive points , had taken its toll			1
@entity1 said : ' i 'm trying to be disappointed but everyone 's being so positive			2
' it 's not that i do n't care , but i 've got a silver medal round my neck and i 'm delighted			0
second best : @entity2 's @entity1 celebrates her silver medal in front of her home crowd at the @entity13 history maker : @entity6 's win was @entity7 's first @entity5 gold in a badminton women 's singles final ' obviously i wanted to go one better but @entity6 was on fire and i had no answer			1
' i gave so much concentration-wise yesterday for those last 10 points - probably the most i have ever concentrated in my whole life - to have to knuckle down and reproduce it was a bit of an ask			0
' i gave my best but maybe i was just not 100 per cent there			0
' despite @entity1 's defeat , @entity2 can still reflect on their most successful badminton showing at a @entity5 , in terms of medals , since 1986			1
@entity58 and @entity59 were the other pair to register on the medal table after taking bronze in the mixed doubles			0
in terms of legacy there will also be high hopes for the future after 11 days of competitive action in the city in front of enthusiastic crowds			0
outclassed : @entity1 was beaten 21 - 14 21 - 6 in 38 minutes by her opponent @entity1 now returns to normality and an essay she has to write as part of her screenwriting and film course at the @entity79			1
she said : ' it 's a film pitch - i do n't actually have to make the film - and it 's on the effects of the referendum on @entity2 sport			2
' it 's due in on the 14th , and then i think we leave for the @entity90 on the 21st			0
' so , no rest for the wicked			0
i 'll just try to enjoy this for the next few days			0
