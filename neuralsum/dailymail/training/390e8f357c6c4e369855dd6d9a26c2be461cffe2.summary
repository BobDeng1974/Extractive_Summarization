@entity0 , @entity1 's deputy , offered peace for @entity3 - in exchange for a clear path to attack the @entity6 the @entity7 attempted to broker a peace offering with @entity9 - if they were allowed a free path to attack the @entity6 , a new book has revealed			1
@entity0 's flight to @entity9 during @entity13 to sign a peace deal ordered by @entity1 has long been recorded as a bizarre one man mission to try and reconcile warring @entity3 and the @entity7			1
but the high - ranking @entity17 was actually carrying out orders from the @entity19 when he flew to @entity20 to @entity21 in may 1941			1
he was to offer the @entity9 government a deal that would see @entity24 pull out of @entity3 - so long as the fascists could attack the @entity6 without intervention			1
but historian @entity27 has discovered evidence he claims proves that the deputy @entity19 held a detailed peace treaty			1
it proposed that the @entity7 would withdraw from western @entity3 , in exchange for @entity9 neutrality over a planned attack on @entity34 , the @entity30 reported			1
the researcher claims in a new book that a @entity24 - speaking unnamed informant told him he was called in to translate the documents that showed @entity24 wanted a clear path to attack the @entity6 within five weeks			1
@entity0 ' mission began with him parachuting out over @entity42 where he was arrested by a farmhand with a pitchfork			2
the @entity17 deputy wanted to contact the @entity46 to set peace talks with @entity48 in motion			1
no deal : sir @entity48 refused to agree to @entity1 's peace deal offered by @entity0 but despite the offer , @entity48 's morals were not swayed by the offer			1
he refused to allow the @entity17 a clear path to attack the @entity56 - because he did not trust @entity1 's promises and it would have jeopardised his efforts to involve the @entity60 in the raging war , mr @entity27 says			1
the author claims the prime minister was determined to beat @entity1 and he did not want to destroy a coalition of @entity66 governments , so the offer was not made public			0
mr @entity27 , who makes the claims in a new book , @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity48 , said : ' this was not a renegade plot			0
' @entity1 had sent @entity0 and he brought over a fully developed peace treaty for @entity24 to evacuate all the occupied countries in the @entity3			1
' @entity0 survived the war and was tried at @entity75 for war crimes			0
he was sentenced to life imprisonment and spent more time behind bars than any other @entity17 leaders before taking his own life in @entity81 near @entity82 in 1987 , aged 93			1
at @entity83 appeared to be the delusional , forgetful , mentally ill figure that @entity1 claimed he was after the abortive mission			0
@entity86 , the ploughman who caught @entity0 it was an act recorded as a one - man mad mission			2
@entity0 was , apparently , trying to set peace talks with @entity48 in motion under his own initiative			0
@entity1 was even supposed to have scrambled aircraft to try to stop @entity0 , his deputy , from leaving @entity24			1
but a 28 - page notebook discovered in a @entity34 archive in 2011 disputes this theory and indicates that @entity1 was in on the mission			2
it was written in 1948 by @entity100 , a long - time adjutant to @entity0			2
he was captured by the @entity6 and spent years undergoing torture and interrogation at their hands			2
in the notebook he writes that @entity1 hoped that an ‘ agreement with the @entity106 would be successful ’			0
@entity100 notes that @entity0 ’s task – five weeks before @entity24 launched its invasion of @entity34 – was to ‘ bring about , if not a military alliance of @entity24 with @entity110 against @entity34 , then to bring about a neutralisation of @entity110 ’			2
@entity100 ’s interrogation transcripts found in the same archive in @entity114 show that @entity1 was not surprised when news came through of @entity0 ’s capture			0
the relevant section reads : ' nor did he rant and rave about what @entity0 had done			0
instead , he replied calmly : ' at this particular moment in the war that could be a most hazardous escapade			0
' ' @entity1 then went on to read a letter that @entity0 had sent him			0
' he read the following significant passage out aloud : " and if this project			0
it will always be possible for you to deny all responsibility			0
simply say i was out of my mind "			0
' this is what would happen after the mission failed , with both @entity1 and @entity48 claiming @entity0 was deranged .			0
