scientists have witnessed carbon dioxide trapping heat in the atmosphere above the @entity3 , showing human - made climate change ' in the wild ' for the first time			1
a new study in the journal @entity8 demonstrates in real - time field measurements what scientists already knew from basic physics , lab tests , numerous simulations , temperature records and dozens of other climatic indicators			1
they say it confirms the science of climate change and the amount of heat - trapping previously blamed on carbon dioxide			1
this graph show carbon dioxide ’s increasing greenhouse effect at a research facility in @entity33			1
as the atmospheric concentration of @entity35 ( blue ) increased from 2000 to the end of 2010 , so did surface radiative forcing due to @entity35 ( orange ) , and both quantities have upward trends			1
this means the @entity42 absorbed more energy from solar radiation than it emitted as heat back to space			1
the seasonal fluctuations are caused by plant - based photosynthetic activity			1
' we see , for the first time in the field , the amplification of the greenhouse effect because there 's more co2 in the atmosphere to absorb what the @entity42 emits in response to incoming solar radiation , ' said @entity60 , a scientist in @entity62 's @entity61 and lead author of the nature paper			1
' numerous studies show rising atmospheric co2 concentrations , but our study provides the critical link between those concentrations and the addition of energy to the system , or the greenhouse effect , ' @entity60 adds			2
he said no one before had quite looked in the atmosphere for this type of specific proof of climate change			1
the scientists used incredibly precise spectroscopic instruments operated by the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) @entity81 , a @entity82			2
these instruments , located at @entity80 research sites in @entity33 and @entity29 , measure thermal infrared energy that travels down through the atmosphere to the surface			1
they can detect the unique spectral signature of infrared energy from @entity35			2
other instruments at the two locations detect the unique signatures of phenomena that can also emit infrared energy , such as clouds and water vapor			2
the result is two time - series from two very different locations			2
each series spans from 2000 to the end of 2010 , and includes 3300 measurements from @entity29 and 8300 measurements from @entity33 obtained on a near - daily basis			2
both series showed the same trend : atmospheric @entity35 emitted an increasing amount of infrared energy , to the tune of 0.2 @entity110 per square meter per decade			2
this increase is about ten percent of the trend from all sources of infrared energy such as clouds and water vapor			0
based on an analysis of data from the @entity122 ’s @entity121 system , the scientists linked this upswing in co2 - attributed radiative forcing to fossil fuel emissions and fires			0
the measurements also enabled the scientists to detect , for the first time , the influence of photosynthesis on the balance of energy at the surface			0
they found that co2 - attributed radiative forcing dipped in the spring as flourishing photosynthetic activity pulled more of the greenhouse gas from the air			0

these instruments , located at @entity80 research sites in @entity33 and @entity29 ( right ) , measure thermal infrared energy that travels down through the atmosphere to the surface			1
they can detect the unique spectral signature of infrared energy from @entity35			0
other instruments at the two locations detect the unique signatures of phenomena that can also emit infrared energy , such as clouds and water vapor			0
the combination of these measurements enabled the scientists to isolate the signals attributed solely to @entity35			0

scientists say carbon dioxide from the burning of coal , oil and gas is the chief cause of global warming			0
in doing so , the data show clouds , water vapor or changes in sun 's radiation are not responsible for warming the air , as some who doubt mainstream climate science claim , @entity60 said			1
the new study in the journal @entity8 demonstrates in real - time field measurements what scientists already knew from basic physics , lab tests , numerous simulations , temperature records and dozens of other climatic indicators			0
nor could it be temperature data being tampered with , as some contrarians insist , @entity60 said			0
' the data say what the data say , ' @entity60 said			0
' they are very clear that the rising carbon dioxide is actually contributing to an increased greenhouse effect at those sites			0
' the study is good technical work , said climate scientist @entity200 of @entity201 , but it is expected — sort of like confirming gravity with a falling rock .			1
