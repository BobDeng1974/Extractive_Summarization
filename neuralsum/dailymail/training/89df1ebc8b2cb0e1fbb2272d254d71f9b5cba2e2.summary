by @entity0 scientists have printed new eye cells for the first time scientists have printed new eye cells for the first time - paving the way to cure some types of blindness in humans			1
their research , which used animal cells to test the concept , is the first step towards producing tissue implants			0
@entity15 researchers used inkjet printers to print two types of central nervous system cells from the retina of adult rats - ganglion cells and glial cells			1
retinal ganglion cells transmit information from the eye to certain parts of the brain and glial cells provide support and protection for neurons			2
the study , by the @entity31 , found that printed cells were able to grow normally and can be kept healthy but more tests are needed before human trials can begin			1
‘ the loss of nerve cells in the retina is a feature of many blinding eye diseases , ’ said professor @entity36 and dr @entity37 from the university who co-authored the study			1
‘ the retina is an exquisitely organised structure where the precise arrangement of cells in relation to one another is critical for effective visual function			2
' they said that the study has shown for the first time that cells derived from the mature central nervous system of the eye , can be printed using a piezoelectric inkjet printer , which uses electrically - charged crystals to deposit materials directly on substrates			1
‘ although our results are preliminary and much more work is still required , the aim is to develop this technology for use in retinal repair in the future , ’ they said			0
@entity70 of the @entity71 , told the @entity72 : ‘ the key to this research , once the technology has moved on , will be how much useful vision is restored			0
@entity15 researchers used animal cells to test their concept which thy believe is the first step towards producing tissue implants , which could be used to cure some types of blindness ‘ even a small bit of sight can make a real difference , for some people it could be the difference between leaving the house on their own or not			1
’ while it is in its very early stages , 3d printing makes it possible to arrange cells into highly defined patterns and structures that can be used in regenerative medicine			0
researchers used an inkjet printer that pushed the cells out through a tiny nozzle when an electrical pulse was applied			2
they also used high speed video technology to take high resolution footage of the process			0
it is the first time the technology has successfully allowed scientists to print mature central nervous system cells			1
‘ the ability to arrange cells into highly defined patterns and structures has recently elevated the use of 3d printing in the biomedical sciences to create cell - based structures for use in regenerative medicine , ’ the researchers said			0

here , a woman has her eyes tested however , 3d printing of cells can present challenges			0
dr @entity134 , a researcher at @entity31 , said : ‘ in order for a fluid to print well from an inkjet print head , its properties , such as viscosity and surface tension , need to conform to a fairly narrow range of values			2
adding cells to the fluid complicates its properties significantly			0
’ the scientists plan on attempting to print other types of retinal cells , such as rods and cones , which handle vision in low light and changes in shape , plus colour and detail			2
professor @entity36 said : ‘ we plan to extend this study to print other cells of the retina and to investigate if light - sensitive photoreceptors can be successfully printed using inkjet technology			1
‘ in addition , we would like to further develop our printing process to be suitable for commercial , multi-nozzle print heads			0
’ the research was published in the journal @entity168 .			0
