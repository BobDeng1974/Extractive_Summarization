an @entity1 village in the popular @entity1 tourist destination of @entity3 has clamped down on couples kissing in public , claiming the sight of such ' obscene ' behaviour offends locals			1
@entity9 , a beautiful fishing village in the western coastal state , imposed a ban on public displays of affection after a unanimously passed a resolution by the village parliament			1
the village , eight miles north of @entity3 's capital @entity17 , has put up signs warning holidaymakers against engaging in @entity20 with the council saying they were forced into the action by a lack of a response from local authorities			1
the resolution also ' banned public drinking and playing loud music			1
' the village parliament in @entity9 in @entity3 , @entity1 , have imposed a ban on public displays of affection @entity1 as a country outlaws kissing in public - here activists from a right - wing @entity34 organisation , @entity33 , prepare to burn placards promoting @entity36 during a protest in @entity38 ' we have adopted this resolution following complaints from villagers about couples kissing in public			1
this was the only way to put an end to it , ' deputy village chief @entity44 told @entity49			2
she however declined to comment on whether punitive action will be taken against potential violators of the bylaws			0
' we have serene beaches which attract tourists in a big way			0
several times we saw couples acting indecently which irked us , ' villager @entity56 told @entity49			0
@entity3 's beaches have long been a haven for millions of tourists drawn mostly from the @entity62 , but a string of controversial statements by local politicians has dented its tourist - friendly image			1
the state is ruled by prime minister @entity69 's @entity34 nationalist @entity68 , which this week barred its female employees from wearing jeans and sleeveless tops in the office			0
a married couple pose on a beach in @entity3 , the state in which locals have complained about kissing in public @entity1 as a whole prohibits obscene acts in public			1
and although its law do n't define ' obscene ' in great detail , it definitely includes @entity20			1
kissing in public , if enforced , can lead to fines or even imprisonment for up to three months			1
with @entity9 clamping down on kissing in the streets , here are some other places where visitors should refrain from kissing , or even holding hands in some cases , in public			1
the @entity94 is the most relaxed of the @entity97 @entity96 nations but kissing in public is still forbidden and can result in deportation , fines or jail @entity94 even though @entity101 is the most relaxed of the @entity97 @entity96 countries , kissing in public is still strictly illegal and could see offenders deported or jailed			1
ahead of last year 's festive season the @entity94 's @entity106 embassy released a take on the @entity110 poem to raise awareness of what is and is n't acceptable in public there			0
“ no holding of hands or @entity110 kisses ; under the mistletoe , despite amorous wishes , ” it said			0
holding hands in public is also frowned upon and public intoxication is very much a no - no. sex on the beach , the act rather than the cocktail , will definitely get you put in jail			0
@entity128 while larger cities with high @entity131 populations may be more tolerant than other areas , couples holding hands or kissing in public goes against the primary values of @entity136 or @entity137 observed in the country			2
there has even previously been a three foot rule for separation between members of the opposite sex - an extreme version of the balloon between teens at a school dance - but @entity20 are still more or less off limits			2
for some , kissing is considered among most intimate of acts meant only for behind closed doors			0
@entity152 the highly controversial ' @entity153 ' prohibits by law those engaging in pornography and pornoaction - a word invented to mean indecent acts			0
this also includes public displays of affection including kissing			2
the law aside , kissing in public deeply offends some locals , especially the older generation , in the most populous @entity168 country in the world			2
@entity170 caught kissing too vigorously in public can be prosecuted and spend up to five years in jail			2
in saying this , @entity174 @entity173 recently celebrated their annual @entity176 in which thousands of locals gather in the streets to take part in a kissing ritual known as omed omedan that is supposed to bring fortune for the coming year			0
a couple hold hands in @entity185 as they walk past a display for @entity187 , the equivalent of @entity36 @entity188 while not forbidden by law , kissing in public just is n't done in @entity188			1
a bow to a friend or family member is far more appropriate than a kiss on the cheek and in general terms kissing passionately is reserved for behind closed doors			0
being a nation renowned for being incredibly polite , it only makes sense to be the same back			0
@entity202 as a predominantly @entity168 country , @entity202 too frown on kissing in public and even holding hands by the opposite sex is n't appreciated			2
indecency laws can be used by police , should they choose to , for overzealous displays of affection and the drinking of alcohol on the streets .			0
