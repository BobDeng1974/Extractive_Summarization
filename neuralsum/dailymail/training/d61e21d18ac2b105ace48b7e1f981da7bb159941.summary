by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 01:35 est , 14 september 2012 smiling , laughing and looking like they were without a care in the world , these photographs of soldiers guarding one of @entity6 's key outposts in 1944 were never meant to see the light of day			2
but this life through a lens on the idyllic @entity14 island of @entity15 was grabbed by a @entity17 war hero in a daring raid behind enemy lines and its incredible contents have been published for the first time today			1
@entity23 @entity22 , 89 , was part of a 47 @entity26 smash and grab sortie on november 1 1944 to the island , in an attempt to punch a hole through the enemy 's defences			1
incredible : frolicking in the sunshine , these @entity34 soldiers have fun in 1944 while the war rages around them - an image that would never have been seen had a @entity17 commando not stolen their camera play time : a @entity34 officer plays with a dachshund on an idyllic beach on the @entity14 island of @entity15 , which was then under @entity6 control @entity15 is an island in the mouth of the river @entity49 , and was a @entity6 stronghold that gave @entity34 forces the use and control of the vital deep sea port of @entity55 in @entity56			1
hero : former @entity26 @entity22 took a camera from a @entity6 bunker and revealed its contents nearly 70 years later aged just 21 then , mr @entity22 took the camera from a @entity34 bunker and carried it with him around @entity63 until the war was over - and there was even enough film left for him to take some of his own pictures			1
as soon as he was back in @entity17 he took them to be developed - and assuming the film would only contain his snaps - he was amazed at what he found			1
the pictures show one unknown @entity34 relaxing on the beautiful sand - swept @entity14 island prior to the allied invasion			1
in one of the photos a @entity34 officer can be playing with his cute dachshund in a scene that could not be further away from the brutal war that was raging around him			1
in another snap soldiers can be seen sprawled across a grassy dune draped over one another while laughing and joking			0
other pictures show officers attending a military briefing and posing up against a wooden post			0
grandfather - of - six @entity22 , who lives in @entity89 , @entity90 , said said he had decided to share the images publicly for the first time after a request from local historians			1
' i think the pictures are fascinating			0
they give a glimpse of war that is rarely ever seen , ' he said			0
' i was amazed when i got them developed			2
i still remember in detail the moment i found the camera			1
' we were sweeping the island of @entity15 in @entity106 , which was riddled with bunkers			1
pinched : the camera taken in the daring raid by @entity22 , in the background , still works to this day guarding : the @entity34 built a series of bunkers on the island , and the one in the background is probably what the commandos raided in 1944 relaxing : two unknown soldiers pose on the banks leading down to the island 's beaches meeting : @entity34 troops lounge on chairs outside in the sunshine in 1944 with several more sitting on grassy banks ' it had sand dunes higher than houses			1
as we were advancing along the dunes we had to check the bunkers			0
' i went down one bunker to make sure it was clear			0
in the corner there was camera in a case : i captured it			0
in that camera was a film			0
' i put in my pocket and kept it with me through the way			0
i took a few photos on that camera myself too			0
' brave : @entity26 @entity22 , pictured 4th from the left , centre row , was part of a team of heroes who carried out raids all over @entity63 brave : @entity155 commando mr @entity22 , aged 20 , took the camera and revealed a never before seen view of life as a @entity34 soldier at the height of the war the 47 @entity26 he belonged to were an elite fighting force of 420 men who fought some of the toughest battles of @entity166			1
its strategic position at the mouth of the river leading to @entity55 meant that @entity15 paid a heavy price in the @entity166			2
soon after the @entity14 surrender in may 1940 the @entity34 took it and scarred its landscape with bunkers and guns , making it a constant target for @entity17 bombers			1
in fact by the end of the war it became one of the most bombed parts of @entity63			2
after four years of occupation @entity186 came on june 6 and the race to take @entity15 was on			2
to launch the final attack against @entity190 's @entity6 , the @entity188 badly needed @entity55 to ensure they could bring in ships with equipment			0
in early september 1944 the city and its port were taken easily , but @entity15 was still occupied so they could not use the @entity49			1
to breach @entity15 's defence , rather than invade , they decided to bomb a sea dike , causing a 150 metre breach that flooded the island			1
the population had been alerted in advance via a pamphlet drop , but a mistake meant bombs also fell on a town , killing about 200 civilians			0
despite the attack he @entity34 stayed so on november 1 troops invaded and re-took the island in a fierce battle			2
@entity22 and his unit famously captured the strategic port of @entity215 , in @entity216 after slipping behind enemy lines on d - day and completing a 12 - mile march through @entity6 territory			2
the heavily fortified port was the vital @entity216 terminal of @entity223 , the @entity224 , which pumped millions of gallons of fuel under the @entity228 to @entity216			0
and their capture of it from the crack @entity34 unit , the 352 @entity232 , went down in the history books as ' the most spectacular of all commando exploits during the actual invasion '			2
@entity22 joined the war effort in 1944 after carrying out over two years of training with the @entity239			1
his first taste of action was storming the beaches of @entity216 on d - day at the age of just 20			0
he stayed in @entity6 until he was demobbed in 1946 and went back to @entity245 to marry his wife june in 1947 , who sadly died 10 years ago at the age of 74			0
but @entity22 , a father of three , spent the rest of his life living in @entity90 working as a coal miner until he retired at the age of 60 and has modestly played down his achievements			2
' i have had a lucky life			0
i survived the war - we had some pretty difficult task to complete - it was a tough old job , ' he said			1
' we were a great unit and people have often referred to us as heroes but unfortunately we also lost a lot of great men through out the war			0
' but i was lucky enough to survive , marry my beautiful wife and bring up three great kids - who have given me wonderful grandchildren			0
' i have often wondered about the lives of the other @entity34 soldiers who are in the pictures but i guess i will never now what happened to them - they probably died			1
' @entity271 m just grateful that i am still here today			0
