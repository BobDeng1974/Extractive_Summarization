by @entity0 the @entity2 government has dedicated $ 89.9 million in the 2014 budget to continue the search for @entity5 in the southern @entity6			1
the money follows government fears the mammoth search effort could continue for another two years , with the current exhaustive operation failing to uncover any sign of the doomed plane			2
the government also announced that $ 27.9 million would be given to the @entity13 to pay for its activities up to june 30 2014 in searching for the lost aircraft			1
another $ 2 million will be spent on the @entity16 , which was established on march 30 to oversee the hunt			1
@entity2 federal budget announced : treasurer @entity19 included funding for the hunt of missing @entity22 @entity5 on tuesday ' the government will provide up to $ 89.9 million over two years from 2013 - 14 as part of @entity2 's commitment to the search for @entity27 , ' budget papers stated			1
' further funding of up to $ 60 million over two years from 2013 - 14 will be provided to the @entity30 for @entity2 's contribution to the next phase of the search			1
' the announcement follows news @entity5 searchers have said electronic ' pings ' initially thought to have come from missing @entity39 flight may not have emanated from the plane at all			1
a senior @entity2 naval officer said he ' increasingly suspects ' some of the signals detected last month did n't come from the jetliner 's black - box flight recorders , piling further doubts over the search effort			2
@entity2 naval commander @entity47 said of four ' pings ' picked up by the @entity51 's @entity50 - 21 autonomous underwater vehicle , two were too weak to have been from a man - made device			1
but two of them now appear to have been too weak to have been from a man - made devic search teams picked up two signals on april 5 at a frequency of @entity70 before two more were received three days later at @entity71			1
while both are significantly lower than the @entity69 black box beacons are designed to emit , the april 5 signals are still possible , down perhaps to weakening batteries or the ' vagaries of deep - sea conditions '			0
@entity78 , captain of the @entity61 vessel , said : ' as far as frequency goes , between 33 khz and 27 @entity81 is a pretty large jump			0
' he did say the authorities still believe that the two april 5 signals , one of which was held for 2 hours and 20 minutes - are consistent with black - box locator beacons			2
fresh doubts : @entity2 naval commander @entity47 said while both readings are significantly lower than the @entity69 black box beacons are designed to emit , the april 5 signals are still possible , down perhaps to weakening batteries or the ' vagaries of deep - sea conditions ' so what was it ? dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between @entity99 and @entity100 to obtain sonic information about their environment @entity78 did not give any clues as to what may have emitted the april 8 ' pings ' if they did not indeed come from @entity5			2
dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between @entity99 and @entity100 to obtain sonic information about their environment			0
experts say dolphins ' lower frequency vocalizations ( between about 0.2 and @entity111 ) are likely used in social communication while higher frequency clicks ( 40 to 150 khz ) are primarily used for spacial awareness			0
days after the signals were detected , @entity2 prime minister @entity115 said he was ' very confident ' they were from the black box on @entity5			0
embarrassing : days after the signals were detected , @entity2 prime minister @entity115 said he was ' very confident ' they were from the black box on @entity5 ' we have very much narrowed down the search area ... and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from @entity5 , ' he said			2
' we have a series of detections , some lasting for quite a long period of time			0
' we 're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade			0
we 're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires			0
' i really do n't want to give any more information than that at this stage ... as a sign of respect to the @entity137 people and their families			0

budget to include $ 89.9 million to fund the long - term search for @entity5
a further $ 27.9 million will be handed to @entity13 to cover the cost of the search so far
finally , $ 2 million to be spent on @entity16 , established march 30 to oversee the hunt for the missing plane
searchers now say 2 of 4 ' pings ' picked up ' too weak ' to be man made
comes as **satellite** firm used in search for @entity5 offers low - cost tracking *system* to *prevent* another flight *disappearing*
*service* to be offered to all **commercial** aircraft with @entity162 **satellite** link
that comprises virtually 100 *percent* of world 's long haul **commercial** fleet
@entity27 has now been missing for two months
