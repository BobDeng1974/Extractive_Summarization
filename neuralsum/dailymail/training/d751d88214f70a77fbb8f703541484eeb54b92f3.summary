@entity3 's life apparently reached a crisis this spring			1
with his power , cable and other utilities cut off because of nonpayment , the 55 - year - old had half a dozen guns in his house and spent weeks planning the kidnapping , targeting firefighters rather than police wednesday so he would n't be shot , authorities said			1
the specific reasons he chose to lash out are n't known , but @entity3 had separated from his wife years earlier , though he still lived across the street from her , her new husband and his two children , according to neighbors and people who knew the family			1
@entity3 had worked as a consultant for @entity4 in 1999 , but described himself as disabled when he filed for bankruptcy protection three years later , according to court documents			1
he said he owed more than $ 100,000 to the @entity42 , banks and credit card companies			0
the records suggest that @entity3 was taping into his retirement savings to make ends meet			1
a series of tax liens had been placed on his home , which slipped into foreclosure in recent months			2
he was arrested and booked into the @entity53 jail in 2010 after he failed to appear in court on a charge of striking an unmanned vehicle			0
@entity3 called 911 wednesday and said he was suffering from chest pains , and five @entity53 firefighters arrived at 3.48pm , believing it was a routine call , said police chief @entity60			1
but when they approached the bed to help him , he pulled out a handgun , @entity60 said			0
he let one of the firefighters go to move the vehicles from the front of his house but kept the other four			1
that began a three - and - a - half hour standoff			1
at about 7.30pm , police were convinced that even if they met @entity3 's demands , he had no intention of releasing his hostages , @entity60 said			1
over the course of several hours of negotiations , police said @entity3 demanded that officers bring him wood and tools so he could board up his windows			1
he also had requested items from a fast food seafood restaurant for himself and his hostages , and a @entity104 officer carrying the food approached the house in @entity107 , about 35 miles northeast of @entity8			1
other @entity104 members set off a stun blast to distract @entity3 and stormed the house			1
@entity3 opened fire on the first officer as he entered the bedroom			1
the man was hit in the left forearm by one of the shots , but managed to return fire , killing @entity3			1
before @entity3 fired , police told him to drop his weapon , @entity60 said			2
exposed wooden beams could be seen through a gaping hole in the side of the house thursday and debris littered the yard			2

after the hostage - taking was reported , dozens of police and rescue vehicles surrounded the home and a negotiator was keeping in touch with the gunman , police said			1
the situation remained tense until the blast rocked the neighborhood of mostly two - story homes and well - kept lawns			1
‘ the explosion you heard was used to distract the suspect , to get into the house and take care of business , ’ @entity186 cpl. @entity185 said in a news conference minutes after the ordeal ended			2
he said the situation had gotten to the point where authorities believed the lives of the hostages were in ‘ immediate danger			2
’ ‘ it 's an unfortunate circumstance we did not want to end this way , ’ @entity201 said			0
‘ but with the decisions this guy was making , this was his demise			0
’ firefighters were able to use their radios to let the dispatch center know what was going on and that 's how negotiators communicated with @entity3 initially , @entity60 said			1
once they got his cell phone service turned back on , they were able to speak to him by phone			2
fire officials did not believe there was any danger in responding to the initial call that seemed routine and dispatched the usual one engine and one ambulance to the house			2

' he was very sick in the mind , ' @entity271 said			0
the neighbor added that as recently as two weeks ago , he offered @entity3 help , but the man declined			2
