by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ when the @entity4 obsession with @entity5 turns to the ‘ panenka ’ penalty he scored against @entity7 at @entity8 , @entity2 ’s keeper ca n’t remember a thing			1
perhaps it is better that way			0
it was in @entity13 , with @entity2 leading 2 - 1 in the shoot - out at the @entity15 , when @entity7 raised his arms and stuck his tongue out at the @entity18 as he took aim from 12 yards			1
@entity7 guessed to his right and the great @entity18 clipped his penalty down the centre of the goal			1
soon enough , @entity2 were heading home			2
‘ i ’ll never regret how it was , i saw it as the best way for us to win the shoot - out , ’ said @entity7			1
cheeky : @entity5 executes a clever chipped ' panenka ' penalty over @entity7 at @entity8 life through a lens : @entity7 leads his team - mates as @entity2 arrive at their hotal in @entity37 before re-facing @entity38 ‘ i do n’t think there was personal vengeance from him and there certainly was n’t any from me			1
he did what he thought he needed to do for his country and i did what i thought was best for mine			0
' i could n’t even tell you what i did			0
but it felt right at the time			0
’ now a two - time @entity55 winner with @entity56 , these are good times for @entity7 , 27 , and he has come to appreciate the demands of playing at the highest level			1
‘ i want to do well for this team and this nation , ’ he added			0
‘ a lot of time and effort has gone into it and the more you ’re involved the more you realise that it is more than football			0
it means an awful lot to a lot of people			0
through his paces : @entity7 trains at the @entity73 military base in preparation for the ultimate test against @entity38 ' a lot of money has been invested and a lot of time and care , from me personally , has gone into this			2
i want to make it all worthwhile			2
’ at the last @entity84 , in @entity83 , @entity7 became increasingly irritated with the @entity18 coaching staff who appeared to be calling him ‘ @entity86 ’			1
@entity87 was the main culprit and @entity7 admitted : ‘ i did take offence about that , but i ’ve calmed down			1
since then i ’ve been called “ @entity86 ” by a lot of @entity18 who know me — i think it ’s just how they talk			2
it was just a mispronunciation			0
’ loggerheads : @entity7 ( second left ) admits frustration over his relationship with ex-boss @entity87 ( left ) a goalkeeper ’s life is a fragile one and there have been times this season when @entity56 ’s keeper has been under fire			1
but he finished the campaign well , and added : ‘ it means a lot to have your club and country behind you			0
‘ i ’ve got to keep working hard because potentially i could go through another bad patch again			0

@entity7 has no regrets over the @entity8 penalty shoot - out
@entity2 keeper wants to make all the @entity84 preparation worthwhile
@entity7 became irritated at @entity87 *'s* staff calling him ' @entity86 '
