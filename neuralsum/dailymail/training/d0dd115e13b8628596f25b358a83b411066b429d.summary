by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:07 est , 27 february 2014 former @entity4 and @entity5 hard man @entity3 has labelled @entity6 a ‘ prat ’			1
the @entity10 midfielder - turned - tv pundit hit out at the @entity12 striker but leant his support to under - fire manager @entity14 who he believes should be given 18 months to make his mark on the squad			1
@entity3 read out on air on @entity19 channel @entity18 comments @entity20 made regarding team - mates occupying ' his zones ' and whether or not his comments show @entity14 ca n't cope with the superstars at @entity25			1
night to forget : @entity6 takes off his @entity4 shirt after losing to @entity27 below par : @entity20 criticised some of his @entity4 team - mates for ' sometimes ' occupying the spaces he wants to play but was blasted by tv pundit @entity3 @entity3 said : ' it can also show you @entity20 is a prat			1
' in other words [ to the comments ] he is not at fault			2
right , he 's not at fault			2
and i watched the game last night and he never tried a leg			2
' @entity14 ca n't make him play			1
he should be out there playing and doing his best			2
that 's what all players should be doing , regardless of manager			2
' while @entity3 wanted @entity14 to be allowed more time to shape @entity4 , fellow pundit @entity47 called on the league champions to cut the @entity49 loose			1
‘ @entity14 has shown in the last few months that he is completely out of his depth , ' said @entity47			1
the former @entity52 striker says he can not imagine a scenario in which @entity4 , managed by @entity14 , will recover from the current malaise that sees them well off the pace in the @entity57 and in danger of @entity60 elimination			1
‘ people are exaggerating how bad this @entity4 side are , ' @entity47 insisted			1
fellow pundit @entity63 pitched into the debate by declaring that defender @entity65 does not want to be at @entity4 and questioning why @entity14 does not follow the lead of his predecessor sir @entity67 and get rid of fractious elements in his squad			1
@entity63 commented , ‘ people are saying @entity4 need five or six players but they need to get in eight , nine or 10			1
’ out played : @entity20 and @entity4 were second best in @entity73 a prat : @entity20 was criticised by @entity19 tv pundit and former midfielder @entity3 airing his views : @entity19 pundit @entity3 called @entity20 a ' prat ' after @entity4 's defeat meanwhile , @entity80 has accused @entity20 of talking ‘ absolute garbage ’ and claimed his @entity60 outburst shows there are ‘ cracks in the camp ’ at @entity25			1
in a withering attack on the @entity4 striker , @entity80 said he had never heard anything like it in his entire career and added it was symptomatic of a deeper underlying problem that is piling the pressure on @entity14			1
‘ it ’s poor , very , very poor , ’ he said on @entity94			2
‘ i ’m a big fan of @entity20 , but what he has come out with is total nonsense			0
it is absolute garbage to say that other players are getting into his zones or his space			0
‘ i played football at the highest level for the best part of 20 years , and i never heard such a thing			0
i never once heard a player say you are getting in my space or zone			0
where he ’s getting that from , i do n’t know			0
critical : @entity3 , @entity63 and @entity47 were not impressed with @entity4 @entity113 enforcer : @entity3 ( left ) playing for @entity4 in the 1963 fa cup final against @entity115 where did it all go wrong ? @entity65 walk off the pitch after losing to @entity27 time to move on : @entity120 's days at @entity4 could be numbered ‘ i ’m sure this is where sir @entity67 would pull him aside and say , “ look , @entity6 , this is a joke			1
you ca n’t be saying this about your team - mates			0
you have got to roll your sleeves up and pull your socks up and start putting the effort in you were before to get back to winning ways			0
” ‘ that ’s how it should be with him , not go off and speak to some @entity136 journalist and slaughter your team - mates			0
that , for me , is saying there are cracks in the camp , and that ’s not good enough			0
‘ it ’s really poor from @entity20			0
you would expect better from a striker who was pivotal in winning the title last season			2
‘ i do n’t know where he ’s coming from with a statement like that			0
maybe it would be different at an attacking set - piece , where you might go on a run to one post or the other to meet the ball and would n’t want a team - mate doing the same , but not in general play			0
it just does n’t make any sense			0
