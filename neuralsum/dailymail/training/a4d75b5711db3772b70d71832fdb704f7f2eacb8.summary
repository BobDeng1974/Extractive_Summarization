marijuana has been blamed for causing car accidents and fuelling acts of violence			1
but now controversial new research suggests that couples who smoke the drug together are actually less likely to be violent towards one another			2
and experts claim it 's not just the effects of cannabis on the brain , but the fact that couples who use it may share similar values and social circles , that may reduce the likelihood of conflict			1
examining the couples over the first nine years of marriage , they discovered that husbands who used the drug around three times a week with their wives , were less likely to be violent towards them in the future			1
marijuana use by husbands predicted less frequent attacks from wives ( illustrated with a stock image ) according to the study marijuana use by husbands also predicted less frequent attacks from wives			0
the study , published in the journal @entity51 , said that the relationship between marijuana use and reduced partner violence was most evident among women with no track record of antisocial behaviour			2
these findings suggest that marijuana use is predictive of lower levels of aggression towards one 's partner in the following year , ’ said dr @entity64 , director of the university ’s @entity30 on @entity31			2
he explained that as with other studies of this kind , the research examines patterns of marijuana use and the occurrence of violence within a year , and does n't look at whether smoking pot on a given day leads to violence at that time			1
‘ it is possible , for example , that - similar to a drinking partnership - couples who use marijuana together may share similar values and social circles , and it is this similarity that is responsible for reducing the likelihood of conflict			1
‘ although this study supports the perspective that marijuana does not increase , and may decrease , aggressive conflict , we would like to see research replicating these findings , and research examining day - to - day marijuana and alcohol use and the likelihood to intimate partner violence on the same day before drawing stronger conclusions			1
’ a study last year found that rates of divorce in heavy drinking couples were the same as those who abstained a study by the same university last year claimed that heavy drinking is bad for marriage if one spouse indulges - but not both			1
researchers followed 634 couples from the time of their weddings through the first nine years of marriage			1
over the course of the nine - year study , nearly half of couples where only one partner drank more heavily , wound up divorcing			2
the divorce rates for other couples were 30 per cent			0
if both spouses were heavy drinkers , the divorce rate was the same as for couples where neither were heavy drinkers			0
' our results indicate that it is the difference between the couple 's drinking habits , rather than the drinking itself , that leads to marital dissatisfaction , separation and divorce , ’ said dr @entity64			0
‘ this research provides solid evidence to bolster the commonplace notion that heavy drinking by one partner can lead to divorce			0
' heavy drinking was defined as drinking six or more drinks at one time or drinking to intoxication			0
the researchers claimed that heavy drinking spouses may be more tolerant of negative experiences related to alcohol due to their own drinking habits			0
they cautioned , however , that this does not mean other aspects of family life remain unaffected			0
‘ while two heavy drinkers may not divorce , they may create a particularly bad climate for their children , ’ dr @entity64 said .			0

study by the @entity28 in @entity32 studied 634 couples in their first nine years of marriage to study the link between the drug and violence
they found the more couples smoked marijuana , the less likely they were to engage in domestic violence a year afterwards
the findings do n't shed light on acts of violence immediately after smoking
experts think couples who use the drug share similar values and social circles , which could reduce the likelihood of conflict
