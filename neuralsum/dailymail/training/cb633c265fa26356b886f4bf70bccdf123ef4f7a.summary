by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:01 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 04:26 est , 14 january 2014 @entity4 police are under mounting pressure to give @entity6 access to three ‘ prime suspects ’ wanted for questioning over the abduction of @entity10			1
@entity12 prosecutors have written to their counterparts in @entity4 , seeking urgent help with their investigation into her disappearance			2
a second ‘ @entity19 ’ – outlining inquiries that @entity22 detectives want carried out by the @entity4 – was sent by the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) last week			1
request : the @entity22 want to interview three prime suspects who could be linked to disappearance of @entity10 officers are thought to be pursuing three burglars who were operating in the area when she went missing it was dispatched a few days after the @entity31 exclusively revealed that @entity6 has identified three local burglars as ‘ prime suspects ’ after an extensive trawl through mobile phone records			1
analysis of mobile phone data suggests that the men were ‘ very close ’ to the scene of @entity42 ’s disappearance when she vanished			2
it also indicates they made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours that followed her abduction in 2007			0
@entity12 detectives believe @entity42 may have been abducted during a bungled burglary			2
the @entity18 first sent an @entity19 on behalf of @entity12 police in july , when the @entity22 upgraded its review - codenamed @entity53 - to a formal investigation , in light of new evidence and new witnesses			1
yesterday the @entity18 and @entity6 refused to comment on the detail of the latest letter to the @entity4 , apart from confirming it was sent last week			1
@entity10 's parents , @entity61 and @entity62 , described the latest move as a ' significant development ' a spokesman for @entity42 's parents @entity61 and @entity62 said : ' the letter is a significant development			2
' it is necessary for @entity12 police to request the @entity4 authorities allow them to operate on their turf			1
' it means they have the intention of arresting and interviewing @entity73 , @entity74 or @entity75 we do n't know who they have their sights on but it 's likely it is the burglars			0
' whether the @entity4 will co-operate remains to be seen			2
it is a very sensitive issue with differences they have had			0
' police want to be given a chance to arrest key suspects			1
it does n't prove they have @entity42 but it will rule them in or out of the investigation and that is important			0
' @entity61 and @entity62 do n't want to build up their hopes too high but they realise it could be a significant new lead			0
' resort : @entity10 went missing from her apartment in @entity100 in @entity101 in 2007 informed sources denied claims that arrests are imminent in the @entity42 case			1
one said : ‘ the legal system in @entity4 is very different to the @entity12 , and it could be many months before any arrests take place			0
’ despite the words of caution , @entity22 commanders are privately delighted with progress being made in its investigation			0
a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we can confirm that a second @entity19 ( @entity116 ) has been sent to the @entity4 authorities by the @entity18 , week commencing 6 january , in connection with @entity53			1
' @entity42 , who was then nearly four , disappeared from her family 's holiday apartment in @entity101 in the @entity121 on may 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends			0
it is now known that between january and may 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area			0
police said in october that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the @entity138 family were staying .			0

@entity53 officers are believed to be pursuing three burglars , identified as prime suspects earlier this month
as revealed by the @entity31 10 days *ago* , the *thieves* were operating in the area where @entity42 went missing
the @entity18 has sent a @entity19 to the police in @entity4 , *reportedly* asking for *permission* to arrest the burglars
