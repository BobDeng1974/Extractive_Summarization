@entity0 has been warned that a feud between the @entity2 and @entity3 is damaging her chances of succeeding @entity5 @entity0 has been given an extraordinary warning that a toxic feud between the @entity2 and @entity3 is damaging her chances of succeeding @entity5 as @entity9 leader			1
a senior party source said support for the steely home secretary as the prime minister ’s successor was being ‘ seriously undermined ’ by a row that has led to two of her senior advisers ’ bids to become mps at the general election being scuppered by @entity23 and @entity3			1
‘ how can @entity0 not see that having her advisers running around behaving badly is harming the support she will need from a bunch of cabinet ministers if she does go for the leadership ? ’ the source said			1
last week it emerged @entity5 personally approved the suspension of @entity31 and @entity32 from the approved list of @entity9 candidates , ostensibly because they refused to campaign in the @entity35 by - election because they believed it would breach civil service rules			1
mrs may is understood to have been told there is ‘ absolutely no chance ’ of her two advisers being reinstated as candidates in time to run as candidates next may			2
@entity9 chairman @entity47 insists civil service rules were changed to allow special advisers to take part in telephone canvassing and mr @entity31 and mr @entity32 were simply being ‘ awkward ’ by declining to take part			1
however , the move against them came after mr @entity31 was linked to criticism of mr @entity5 in a magazine profile of mrs may			1
number ten is known to be exasperated by speculation about the home secretary ’s leadership ambitions and her camp ’s criticism of what they see as as incompetence in the prime minister ’s political operation			1
veteran former cabinet minister @entity68 , who clashed with mrs may when they were in @entity70 together , praised her as one of the most impressive figures in the @entity73 and called for an end to the ‘ spat ’ that has exploded into the open			2
‘ it ’s quite entertainingly newsworthy but somebody should stop all their entourages falling out with each other , ’ mr @entity68 told the @entity78 ’s @entity77 programme			0
‘ the relations between the people themselves are good			0
@entity84 is one of the strongest ministers in the government			0
any prime minister – and @entity5 is very sensible about this – accepts he wants strong ministers at the top of his government			1
the entourage seem to be having a little spat between themselves			0
’ @entity5 personally approved the suspension of @entity31 ( right ) and @entity32 ( left ) from the approved list of @entity9 candidates because they refused to campaign in the @entity35 by - election number ten is said to be fed up of criticism of what they see as as incompetence in @entity5 's political operation from may 's camp chancellor @entity110 is said to have been concerned by a surge in support for mrs may among party activists , among whom she is now the clear favourite to succeed mr @entity5 , though sources insisted he had played no role in the suspension of mr @entity31 and mr @entity32			1
one of the home secretary ’s supporters was yesterday quoted as saying : ‘ @entity110 is obsessed with having spies everywhere so he can either succeed @entity5 or be kingmaker			2
@entity84 has every right to protect her own interests			0
‘ that is not disloyalty and she will not be intimidated by anyone in @entity3			0
’ @entity9 backbencher @entity128 said : ‘ the man pulling the strings is @entity110 , not @entity5			1
‘ @entity110 is desperate to ensure he has enough mps in place to vote him on to the shortlist of two , which is put before members to choose the next leader , should there be a contest in 2015			0
those two are likely to be @entity139 and @entity0			0
’ she added : ‘ if @entity31 and @entity32 become mps that is two more votes for @entity0 and two fewer for @entity110			0
@entity0 has had a lot to put up with			0
the more popular she is among party members , the nastier it becomes in @entity145			0
’ mrs may has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to mr @entity5 and personal relations between the two remain reasonable , though she has never been part of his inner circle			2
however , the home secretary , dubbed ‘ @entity154 ’s @entity153 ’ by allies , is thought to regard mr @entity139 as a ‘ faintly ridiculous ’ figure and would run against him if the @entity156 lose in may and mr @entity5 is forced to quit .			2
