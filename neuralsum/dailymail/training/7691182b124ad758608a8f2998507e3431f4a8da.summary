for decades @entity0 in downtown @entity1 has been home to the largest display of human misery in the @entity5 - but now the area is facing its greatest challenge - gentrification			1
since the @entity9 of 2006 , the @entity8 has been steadily clearing @entity0 of vagrants and homeless by stepping up the search and arrest of the down - and - outs who line its street corners			1
and for the past 20 - years , photographer @entity17 has been documenting the slow metamorphosis of the iconic neighborhood of @entity1 as it evolves from hosting the lowest dregs to even welcoming a brand new @entity22 store			1
cleaning the streets : an officer with the @entity8 arrests a man who has been found on the corner of a @entity0 avenue - as they begin a process which started in 2006 ' i started documenting the area in 1995			2
derelict people -- mostly @entity32 and @entity33 -- numbering in the thousands , — are concentrated in @entity0 , ' said @entity17 to @entity35			1
' the missions came to the area first			0
the @entity38 is over forty years old , and the @entity39 , now in a new building on @entity41 , has been in the community for ninety years			0
rounded up : a police officer with the @entity8 surveys a disabled homeless man on the streets of @entity0 who is showing no signs of waking from his sleep cuffed : another homeless individual who is living in a neat tent on a @entity0 sidewalk is arrested by police and presumably taken away from the gentrifying area what 's this ? an officer with the @entity8 searches a man who he has arrested on @entity0 and is questioning him about what he has found on him ' many of the hotels built long ago to accommodate travelers arriving by train became single room occupancy hotels providing cheap places to live			1
after the missions came the soup kitchens , health facilities , and methadone clinics			0
' from short - term workers and migrants feeling the hardships of the @entity71 , to servicemen shipping out during the @entity73 and @entity74 , @entity0 has always had a transient nature			2
its most recent inhabitants have been those who find they have nowhere else to turn as drug addicts and alcoholics come to its streets to try to fight their demons			0
' however , in recent years @entity0 has been transformed , ' said @entity17			1
' in addition to the museums , corporate offices and government buildings , many old industrial and commercial buildings in the area are being transformed into lofts , galleries , restaurants and luxury hotels			0
as @entity1 ’ old downtown is transformed into a new city center , officials have necessarily declared that the old @entity0 and the new downtown can not coexist			1
' i 'm only sleeping : this woman has taken a nap ontop of her worldly possessions as she rests on a stretch of @entity0 in @entity1 work to be done : city sanitation workers move in to clear up @entity0 after decades of neglect during which the area became a mecca for vagrants and homeless people who needed somewhere to stay passed out : this man seems to have laid himself out on the sidewalk of @entity0 in a rather slap - hazard fashion - which is presumably one of the reasons why the @entity8 are trying to clean up the streets of the notorious area witness to what amounts to a virtual clearing of the streets by the @entity8 , @entity17 recounts how he was watched the tactics of police first hand			1
' over the years , i have witnessed many such incidents along @entity0 , but none impressed me more than the one i saw in may of 2007 when a police car arrived , siren blaring and its loudspeaker screaming ' @entity128 , @entity129 up ! ' ' startled — and thinking a violent crime must have occurred — i saw a policeman standing over a sleeping figure on the sidewalk at @entity134			2
it was nine o’clock in the morning and apparently the destitute person under the blanket had overslept			0
' shoe and a home : this person has neatly laid out shoes to sell or that they own on the sidewalk of @entity0 - however , while this display is controlled - other 's have not been so lucky and have been moved on by the @entity8 community : three men chat away the day in the afternoon @entity1 sun on @entity0 as one of them animatedly makes his point sad and lonely : for decades @entity0 in downtown @entity1 has been home to the largest display of human misery in the @entity5 - but now the area is facing its greatest challenge - gentrification life goes on : since the @entity9 of 2006 , the @entity8 has been steadily clearing @entity0 or vagrants and homeless by stepping up the search and arrest of the down - and - outs who line its street corners ' many of the hotels built long ago to accommodate travelers arriving by train became single room occupancy hotels providing cheap places to live			1
after the missions came the soup kitchens , health facilities , and methadone clinics			0
' wit and art : from short - term workers and migrants feeling the hardships of the @entity71 , to servicemen shipping out during the @entity73 and @entity74 , @entity0 has always had a transient nature no hope : its most recent inhabitants have been those who find they have nowhere else to turn as drug addicts and alcoholics come to its streets to try to fight their demons indeed , these people are homeless , and while a @entity22 may be a symbol of downtown @entity1 's gentrification , the former residents need somewhere to go			1
' when i asked who was pushing the homeless out of @entity0 a woman explained ' the city , the police , the maintenance people , ' said @entity17			1
' i asked : where are they going ? she replied : ' they are going to jail			0
they are going under the bridges , by the @entity203			0
they are going to the missions , but some do n’t want to go there			0
' feeling as if he is watching the end of @entity0 as we have known it , @entity17 , who has published a new book entitled , @entity209 , @entity210 , knows how impoverished neighborhoods can change			1
' as the police gradually gain control over @entity0 , i feel i am witnessing its last days			2
in a decade or so @entity0 will perhaps become @entity1 ’s equivalent of @entity219 ’s @entity218			2
' @entity17 is a photographer and writer , a @entity222 fellow , and the author of many books			2
