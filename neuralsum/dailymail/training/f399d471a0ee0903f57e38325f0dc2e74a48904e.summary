@entity0 today warned that @entity1 would be more at risk from terrorism if it votes for independence			1
the prime minister said the @entity6 had the best security and intelligence services in the world to keep people safe			1
he said the safety of staying together in a ‘ very dangerous and insecure world ’ was one of the ‘ strongest arguments ’ against separation			1
‘ i would have thought one of the strongest arguments that those of us who want to see the @entity6 stay together can make is in that dangerous world and insecure world of terrorist threats and other threats is n’t it better to be part of the @entity6 ? ’ he said the @entity6 ‘ has a top five defence budget , that has some of the best security and intelligence services anywhere in the world , that is part of every single alliance that really matters in the world in terms of @entity19 , the @entity40 , the @entity41 , a permanent member of the @entity43 of the @entity44 ’			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ to have all those networks and abilities to work with allies to keep us safe , is n’t it better to have those things than to separate yourselves from them			0
‘ those are some of the arguments we will be making in the weeks to come before this vital vote			1
’ mr @entity0 's remarks came after the former prime minister @entity57 vowed to lead a campaign for more powers for @entity1 if it rejects independence in this month ’s referendum			1
the former prime minister , signalling his return to front line politics , said he would push for further devolution within weeks of the september 18 vote			1
mr @entity57 is among senior @entity68 figures being deployed in a final push by the party to prevent its supporters being won over by the @entity72			1
with polls suggesting a late swing towards the @entity76 camp , mr @entity57 urged voters not to ‘ abandon ’ the huge value to @entity1 of pooling resources with the rest of the @entity6 in areas such as pensions and healthcare			1
he told an audience of activists and politicians at @entity87 that he had asked speaker @entity88 to allow him to lead a debate when the @entity90 resumes business in october to galvanise cross-party support for reforms			0
a pledge of extra tax and legal powers for @entity97 in the event of a rejection of independence in the popular vote has been signed by the leaders of all three main @entity87 parties			2
@entity57 ( left ) spoke in @entity104 today ahead of the forthcoming @entity1 vote for independence on september 18 mr @entity57 said the aim should be the ‘ maximum local decision - making powers that is possible ’ while maintaining the union			1
‘ the status quo is not now an option			0
a no vote does not mean no change			0
’ he said : ‘ a no vote will usher in the further constitutional reforms in social , economic and fiscal affairs and a no vote will mean the choice you have made is against separation but for further devolution to the @entity97			1
‘ over the next few months after the referendum , we can take the lead in ensuring that these powers - that the conservatives and @entity127 say they would support - can be implemented as quickly as possible			0
‘ i have asked the speaker that when @entity97 returns after the referendum in october , that in the first week he allows me to lead a debate about how we can secure the timetable and the delivery of the further devolution proposals			0
@entity72 leader @entity134 was canvassing in @entity136 fish market today ‘ this is not like 1979 when the then - @entity126 government promised change and then denied us it			2
this is like 1997 when the @entity68 government came in and , within a year , had delivered its promise of a @entity1 parliament			2
‘ when we are talking about the future of the constitution , @entity104 must and will change , @entity87 must and will change , and , of course , the @entity6 must and will change			2
’ he told the meeting - hosted by @entity152 - that the no camp ‘ will accept whatever result comes our way ’			0
‘ but the @entity72 have got to recognise that if they lose this ... we have got to get back to the issues of improving public services			0
‘ i think the @entity126 will have to accept these proposals ... the strong weight of opinion for them			0
‘ we stand ready to talk to other parties about how we could reach a consensus on these proposals for the future			0
’ mr @entity57 said the @entity6 was a uniquely successful arrangement anywhere in the world			1
it offered pooled resources across four nations ‘ to guarantee to anyone no matter where they are in any part of the @entity6 that they have the same right to healthcare , to help when unemployed , to dignity in retirement and , of course , to dignity and support when they are sick , disabled or vulnerable			2
‘ that is a principle that we should never abandon			0
’ he dismissed @entity72 plans for a corporation tax cut as ‘ the @entity1 @entity188 backing the fat cats and obviously cheered on by the cybernats ’			2
he also dismissed the level of demand for an @entity194 parliament			0
‘ the @entity194 do not want a parliament of their own			0
if they wanted it , that would be an issue , but there is no evidence that there is a desire for an @entity194 parliament , ’ he said			0
‘ we have got to recognise the assymetric nature of the @entity6 constitution , find a way of accommodating the ambitions of all the different nations - and indeed the regions			1
