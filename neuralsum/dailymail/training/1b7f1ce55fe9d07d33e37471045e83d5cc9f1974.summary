controversial @entity1 playmaker @entity0 has been left in limbo , having been left out of @entity4 ’s pre season squad and with no interest forthcoming from @entity6 , the club he was loaned to last season			1
the 25 - year - old @entity10 playmaker spent time with @entity11 and @entity6 during the last campaign , but neither would be willing to take the former @entity14 on a permanent move			1
@entity0 reported back for pre season training at @entity1 ’s @entity18 base earlier this month but he has been omitted from @entity4 ’s squad for their @entity21 tour			2
loan spell : but @entity6 are not willing to make the @entity0 's deal at the @entity26 permanent where next ? @entity0 faces a difficult situation at @entity1 where he is out of favour with @entity4 his relationship with the former @entity32 boss has cooled and @entity0 is now in a difficult situation – unwilling to go on loan again and with no clubs showing a concrete interest			1
even @entity37 , who is out of contract at @entity39 but in talks over a new deal , was included in the 26 - man tour party at @entity0 ’s expense			0
rs owner @entity44 spoke earlier this month about his interest in keeping @entity0 at @entity39 , but his relationship with @entity4 would appear to rule their former talisman out of the first team for now			2
' he is probably one of the best players i have ever seen , ' @entity44 said			0
' he has a great football brain – he knows it			0
but it is up to him whether he wants to do it or not			0
from a professional standpoint i think it would be great if he stayed			0
' not keen : @entity4 's relationship with the once - talismanic playmaker has cooled not quite a saviour : @entity0 spent half of last season on loan at @entity11 but they were later relegated @entity63 : @entity0 gives @entity64 a torrid time with his dribbling here , but he is now stuck at @entity1			1

@entity70 playmaker 's relationship with the rs manager has cooled
former @entity14 @entity14 is not *attracting* interest
a loan spell in @entity6 has not has not *convinced* the @entity6 to *invest*
out of contract *midfielder* @entity77 makes rs tour squad *ahead* of him
he could face a spell in the *reserves* if things do *n't* *change*
