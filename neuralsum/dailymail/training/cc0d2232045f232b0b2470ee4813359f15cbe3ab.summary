by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 11 november 2012 updated : 11:57 est , 11 november 2012 an @entity2 community has painted over a @entity5 artist 's mural commissioned by a nonprofit organisation to improve their neighbourhood - because they say its depictions of snakes is ' satanic '			2
covering a wall in southwest @entity2 by @entity5 graffiti artist @entity12 the art features a fantasy creation of a part - human , part - alligator , part - fish under the commission of non-profit group @entity18			1
' the fishes were satanic , the scales were satanic			0
you know , they just do n't feel that it represents their community , ' @entity21 , a mutually upset resident from the wall 's @entity23 neighbourhood , told @entity29			1
defaced : part of @entity5 artist @entity12 's mural , commissioned by a non-profit group in @entity2 , is seen before upset residents covered it with paint on friday calling it ' satanic ' upset : seen as part alligator , part human , part fish , some residents were upset by it calling for its removal before taking matters into their own hands aftermath : the wall is seen on friday morning after grey paint was rolled across it with the help of a former @entity49 lawmaker who lives nearby waking up on friday morning , however , residents who had enjoyed the mural were outraged to see sections of grey paint rolled across it - just days after a petition was signed by more than a thousand residents to save it			1
' to see it being defaced that way , it was disappointing and saddening , ' nearby resident @entity57 told @entity29			0
there with her was her young son @entity62 who said he had enjoyed the mural too , making a face over the work 's aftermath to show his described disgust in its covering			0
' i did n't think it was nice , ' he said			0
but what 's now at the heart of the issue , however , is whether @entity18 had permission to create the mural in the first place , as fans of the mural spent the remainder of friday scrubbing off the grey paint			1
restoration : fans of the mural spent the remainder of friday scrubbing off the paint to restore it to its former display failed petition : a woman scrubs at the covered mural on friday that was defaced despite a petition that collected more than 1,000 signatures to save it hard work : the 23 - year - old graffiti artist , seen during its creation , spent a month working on it as one of many artists commissioned by the group world - wide the property belongs to the @entity100 who have said that they never issued a permit for the mural			1
arguing their case , @entity18 showed signed applications approving the mural by three @entity2 city departments			1
the group said they did n't realize they needed @entity110 to pass an ordinancy approving the work as well			1
' nobody in the @entity23 community knows what this represents			0
that is unbelievable , ' former state representative @entity117 told @entity119			0
illegal : brewing controversy is whether either side had right to paint on the wall with it belonging to the @entity100 , councilwoman @entity121 seen upset at the scene disgust : a resident upset by the grey paint rolled across the mural shows his disgust mr @entity117 was one of the many who helped cover the mural that morning with a @entity133 posting helping organize the event titled : painting over , of the wall on @entity137 asked if it 's true he did n't have a permit to paint over the wall on friday himself , he told cl : ' that 's right			1
did n't try to get a permit ... i do n't think i have to			2
i 'm a tax payer			0
' amid the outcry of the work which took the 23 - year - old artist a month to create for the @entity2 non-profit - whose said goal is to provide artists from all over the world an opportunity to ' create a more intimate relationship ' between themselves and the community - more than 1,000 signatures were collected to save it			1
future : what 's now uncertain is the future of the mural despite its restoration efforts on friday regardless , mr @entity117 said those numbers should nâ€™t matter			2
' it is so wrong for them to get petitions from people who live in @entity166 and @entity167 and not come to @entity23 and talk to us , ' mr @entity117 said of its location			0
' all we want is a process for how to deal with artists who come to our neighbourhood and doing what they want to do			0
we have some art we want to do in our community , ' he said			0
the mural has since been restored to before its defacing , but @entity100 says they will most likely have to cover it up again .			2

*included* in the defacing was a former state lawmaker who acknowledged not having a permit to paint over it
@entity110 argues non-profit @entity18 did n't have all the right permissions to paint the wall in the first place
over 1,000 signatures had petitioned to *protect* the mural before it was defaced on friday
