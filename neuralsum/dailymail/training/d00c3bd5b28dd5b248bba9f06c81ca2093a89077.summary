hair brand @entity1 claim that their new curve curling tong collection will give girls curls that stay up as long as they do			1
we like a challenge on @entity8 almost as much as we like a party , and so contributing editor @entity10 hopped on a plane to @entity12 to put the bold claim to the test			1
here 's how her hair fared ... before and after : from sleepyhead to @entity19 as @entity8 contributing editor @entity17 prepares to put @entity1 's 24 hour curls claim to the test in @entity12 7am : getting prepped by celebrity hairdresser and @entity1 ambassador @entity23 @entity17 says : ' i 'm usually a wash and go kind of girl when it comes to doing my own hair but i never say no to a party			1
24 hours in @entity12 + my own personal hairdresser + the promise to keep the bar tab open as long as i could stay up = my dream day / night out			1
' i decided to make the most of having a super stylist at my disposal first thing ( @entity23 's most recent @entity40 post before our trip featured him and supermodel client @entity43 ) and as well as having hair that stayed glam for 24 hours i demanded to look like @entity19 , who has been my hair idol since the @entity46 days			1
' these days , ' @entity23 , @entity1 's styling ambassador , told me , ' we call these kind of long , loose , lovely curls " @entity50 waves "			1
i loved what he did with the wand and asked the @entity57 - born @entity56 boy to move in with me about 30 minutes into my mini break makeover			0
a very good start to my good hair day			0
' 9am : boutique hotel breakfast at @entity62 then off on our travels around the city ' @entity12 's first boutique hotel seemed a fitting place to prepare for our glamorous day trip			1
as i foraged around the breakfast buffet a small child actually waved at me , well , at ' the hair '			0
i felt a bit like @entity73 ( although @entity73 probably would n't have wolfed two croissants and a cheese selection so early in the morning )			0
' 7am : getting prepped by celebrity hairdresser and @entity1 ambassador @entity23 ( and checking the day 's hectic shooting schedule for the first bar break ) * add a root lift product to damp hair , blow dry with lots of volume using a paddle / round brush * using a classic tong , twist sections of hair around the full length of the barrel ( twisting makes the curls flatter rather than corkscrew cutesy ) leaving the ends free to keep the look modern			1
nb random sections can look cool if you do n't have much time * after a few seconds of heating the hair remove from the barrel and gently pull			0
do n't brush or shake out			0
* @entity99 all over with a strong hairspray how - to : blow dry with lots of volume using a paddle / round brush and then using a classic tong , twist sections of hair around the full length of the barrel ta - da : twisting the hair as you pull it around the barrel makes the curls flatter rather than corkscrew cute			2
leave the ends free to keep the look modern 11am : taking in some culture at the @entity120 ( @entity118 ) in @entity121 ' this is one of the city 's favourite galleries and featured great space and light and very serious staff , basically everything you want from an art gallery			1
current exhibitions include a 20th anniversary collection ( ' how soon was now ' ) and a show from @entity56 - based artist @entity134 based on banal @entity136 pictures and featuring trash , pet food , and even maggots			2
the grubs made some hair curl			0
@entity142 stayed ' totes ' @entity50			0
' 11am : taking in some culture at the @entity120 ( @entity118 ) in @entity121 1pm - experiencing secret @entity12 at @entity145 , an abandoned aqua complex in @entity147 ' we got a glimpse into the secret side of @entity12 with a trip to an abandoned swimming pool complex hidden from sight and slowly falling into beautiful decay			1
originally the aqua centre featured pools , slides , waterfalls , saunas , @entity161 baths ... but now it 's mostly used as a skate park / hangout by @entity12 's cool kids			1
a must - see and a total health hazard … and i was entirely over-styled and overdressed for the occasion but it made a great backdrop for some hot hair pictures			0
' 1pm - experiencing secret @entity12 at @entity145 , an abandoned aqua complex in @entity147 1pm - experiencing secret @entity12 at @entity145 , an abandoned aqua complex in @entity147 3pm - lunch at @entity173 in @entity174 this was my first chance to swish the hair at hot @entity178 as we late lunched at the very hip @entity173 , named - of course - after our beloved @entity181			1
i 'm sure the @entity182 would have approved of the pulled pork burgers served with piles of pickle jalapeños , the homemade lemonade cocktails and definitely the handsome baristas			2
3pm - lunch at @entity173 in @entity174 5pm - a history lesson at the @entity189 in @entity191 - @entity190 after lunch it was time to learn a bit about the city as the curls battled with blustery conditions next to the @entity198			1
the @entity189 is a memorial built on a section of the @entity201 and it 's the largest open air gallery in the world featuring bright , bold murals remembering the city 's history and celebrating its future			2
7pm - back at @entity62 getting ready to hit the town back at the hotel it was time to ramp up the eyeliner and start breathing in as i donned a bodycon dress			0
no need to 're - zhujh ' the hair though , i just threw my head upside down , gave it a quick ruffle and walked out the door			0
massive result and serious time saving points for those of us who like to get to the bar as early as possible			0
7pm - back at @entity62 getting ready to hit the town 9pm - @entity226 at the @entity227 at the 25hours @entity12 the @entity227 got it 's name because drinkers have a direct view into the monkey enclosures in the @entity232 below			1
there was a lot of interesting wildlife around the rum - themed bar too , which was packed even on a tuesday night and a perfect place to put ' the hair ' - dropping slightly but still still going over 12 hours in - to the test with a quick smirt on the balcony outside			2
11pm - @entity243 dinner at @entity244 in @entity245 berliners do n't really do diets ... but they wo n't argue with an eating plan that guarantees more energy to stay out partying			1
@entity243 - aka eating like a caveman - is hot right now in this city and @entity252 is the leader of the pack			1
it helps that @entity256 the owner resembles a male model ( that no sugar , no dairy , no processed regime obviously works )			0
we feasted on steak tartare , monkfish , and dairy - free fondant and drank too many of the brilliantly named @entity266 cocktails , with ' the hair ' scoring a second round on the house			2
11pm - @entity243 dinner and drinks at @entity244 in @entity245 ( right ) @entity252 ’s menu emerged from boss @entity274 's personal experience of transforming his body through the @entity243 diet			1
according to fans of this way of eating , adjusting your eating habits to @entity243 principles means feeding your body as nature intended , resulting in noticeable health benefits because the unprocessed and / or raw ingredients used have high nutritional value			1
chef , author and restaurateur @entity274 is spearheading the trend for @entity243 eating in @entity12 the @entity293 ( @entity294 and @entity295 ) combine the beets and honey in a sauce pan , and cook on medium - low heat for 10 minutes , or until beets are soft			1
in the mean time , combine in a bowl the eggs , fats , vanilla , cardamom and cocoa and whisk well			0
preheat the oven to 135 ° @entity309 remove beets from heat , transfer to a food processor , or blend using a hand blender until completely pureed			0
combine both mixtures , add walnuts and a pinch of salt			0
lay the mixture on a greased square oven dish ( or lined with baking paper ) and bake for 30 minutes or until firm			0
1am - cool cocktails at @entity323 in @entity147 a trip to @entity12 is n't complete without stumbling across a secret bar			1
and this smoky speakeasy was the perfect place to deconstruct our day and plan the rest of our night			0
the back shelves here were filled with dangerous - looking bottles of home - flavoured spirts and there was no main cocktail menu , instead the ( only slightly intimidating ) bar staff created bespoke cocktails based on what we felt like drinking and doing ( my tipple was an incredible tequila , rosemary and coffee concoction which acted as the perfect pick - me - up )			1
3am ( and onwards ) - dancing at @entity347 in @entity348 @entity348 is the place to be after the clock strikes 12 any day of the week in @entity12			2
there 's a cheap bar , outside space , secret rooms and a great @entity356 line - up ( even on a tuesday )			0
this was the final push for the curls , could they last spinning around a smoky , sweaty dance floor ? they did			2
longer than i could in fact as i headed home around 6am with them still bobbing behind me			0
it 's probably for the best that no pictures were allowed			0
1am - cool cocktails at @entity323 in @entity147 and 3am ( and onwards ) - dancing in @entity348 7am - time to call it a night back at @entity62 after watching the sunrise from our pretty balcony it was time for bed			2
my hair certainly smelled like it had been out for 24 hours ( and the rest ) after partying with the city 's smokers but it managed to look quite a bit fresher than i felt			1
7am - time to call it a night back at @entity62 verdict : sold.the magic wand lived up to its 24 hour claim			2
yes , it helps having a hair superstar styling your ' do to begin with , but @entity23 did n't do anything groundbreaking to my barnet , he just prepped it really well using more product than i usually would , blow - dried it properly ( which i never bother to do ) and then spent time working patiently through all sections of the hair			2
it did n't take as long as it looks like it should have			0
it did include a lot of hairspray			0
and it did put a bounce in my step all day and night			0
having taken some tips from the hair guru and learned not to spend my evenings scraping my hair up and down according to temperature issues i will be taking my @entity1 curls out on the town again as soon as my liver allows .			1

writer spent 24 hours drinking in the sights and soaking up the *nightlife* of @entity12 to come up with a *whirlwind* guide to the city
*activities* included galleries , *clubbing* , cocktails and @entity243 dining
@entity1 claim new curve collection tongs will keep curls in for 24 hours
