click here for @entity2 's look at the opening weekend of @entity4 's new club competition and his predictions ahead of the pool stage as @entity9 rugby enters a new era with the @entity11 set to kick off after a dark period behind the scenes for the code , @entity7 rugby correspondent @entity2 focuses on the stars of the show to pick out five potential standouts for this year 's competition			2
@entity19 ( @entity20 ) an horrendous run of injuries have severely hindered @entity24 ’s progress , but at 24 he is still young enough to have a long international career			0
very highly thought of by @entity27 ’s management , @entity24 ( right ) could yet put pressure on @entity29 for the no 7 shirt			0
@entity24 is back near his best after a nightmare run of injuries and set to shine for @entity20 in @entity4 @entity34 ( @entity35 ) hugely gifted @entity37 second row who some believe has the potential to emulate @entity41 in one of the toughest positions in the sport			1
out of contract at the end of the season , the young lock is attracting attention from all quarters			2
second rower @entity34 will be the highest of priorities for @entity35 to keep now their new home is set @entity55 ( @entity56 ) will he ? wo n’t he ? the @entity37 qualified flanker was one of the players of the tournament last season as @entity56 retained the @entity61			1
he is considering a move to @entity63 , but wherever he plays @entity55 is likely to have a big impact			0
@entity55 's rumoured move back to @entity27 from @entity56 appears to have fizzled , but he 's a superstar @entity66 ( @entity63 ) the former soldier has dodged bullets in @entity69 , but has turned his attention to professional rugby union in recent years and is proving to be a huge success			1
@entity66 has sensational feet and pace and could yet make @entity76 ’s @entity75 squad			0
the @entity79 - born former @entity78 star @entity66 has made his mark for @entity63 big time this season @entity82 ( @entity83 ) @entity84 may be the most talked about @entity86 winger , but young @entity82 has a huge future ahead of him if he can stay fit			1
the speedster has pace to burn and a mesmerising side - step which make him a constant try - scoring threat			0
@entity82 may not be the household name of other @entity86 wingers , but the @entity83 flyer is one to watch			2
