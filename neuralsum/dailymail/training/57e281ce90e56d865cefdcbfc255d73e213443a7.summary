by @entity1 reporter published : 13:25 est , 30 november 2013 @entity3 : 14:50 est , 30 november 2013 the man who created the @entity6 plastic gun is revelling in a title that has seen him voted the 14th most dangerous person in the world			2
@entity10 , a former law student at the @entity11 in @entity12 , says he is proud that people consider him to be ' dangerous '			1
' i consider that one of the finest achievements in my young career			0
probably never to be topped again			0
' mr @entity10 is well aware of the controversy his invention has created , but disputes the fact that he is dangerous to anyone			1
' dangerous to who ? dangerous to what ? how often can one individual p * * * off the entire world ? the entire world of financial and government superstructures ? ' he asks with a smirk			2
' i hope to make it back up the lst , but i 'll settle for 14			0
it was a good run			0
designs for the ' liberator ' pistol were posted online by @entity35 but the @entity49 ordered the website to take down the blueprints , on the basis that the plans could violate export regulations			1
the blueprints , that could be produced on @entity6 printers costing as little as $ 1,000 , were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition			1
mr @entity10 made the schematics for the weapon available for free - meaning everyone with a high - end 3 - d printer can create their own version of the gun			1
practicing his aim : there are ways that this can potentially create a huge problem for the @entity75 public crude : the @entity48 plastic gun is a simple single - shot weapon that fires a small .380 - caliber bullet homemade : @entity10 's @entity80 s designs were downloaded more than 100,000 times in just two days before federal officials demanded their removal in may plastic : sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the @entity48 are plastic , constructed by a @entity6 printer			1
a small nail is used for a firing pin sixteen of the 17 parts in the @entity48 pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the @entity96 3d printer			1
the final piece of the weapons - the firing pin - is a common nail			1
mr @entity10 told @entity100 that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them			1
it is a bid , he says , to keep governments accountable to the people			0
' you can print a lethal device			0
it ’s kind of scary , but that ’s what we ’re aiming to show , ' he said			0
' anywhere there ’s a computer and an internet connection , there would be the promise of a gun			0
' the name of the @entity121 - comes from a simple @entity123 pistol that was designed by the @entity75 military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied @entity127 and concentration camps			1
like its @entity123 predecessor , the @entity35 pistol is a crude weapon			1
it holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore			0
@entity6 printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine , to construction to aerospace			0
the process , also called additive manufacturing , creates a three - dimensional solid object from a digital model			2
the feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic			0
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			0
the machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			2
the process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s			0
however , since 2010 , an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3 - d printers , which are increasingly small , increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable			1
@entity35 used a higher - end $ 8,000 model to build its @entity6 gun			2
however entry - level desktop models can cost $ 500 to $ 1,000			2
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
engineers hope 3 - d printing will begin an era of ' instant prototyping ' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively			2
the group has successfully fired it with a .380 - caliber pistol round			1
however , an attempt to shoot a slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces			0
currently , the @entity48 can only be made through highly specialized processes on an $ 8,000 3 - d printer			2
mr @entity10 says he hopes to adapt the model the technology behind 3 - d printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades			1
it is only since about 2010 , though , that 3 - d printers have become cheap enough , simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to purchase			2
the guns are made out of plastic , so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event			0
the only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors , for instance , when you go through an airport			1
current law bans all - plastic weaponry			0
defense distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle , to get around the law			1
worries : officials are concerned about individuals slipping plastic guns past metal detectors and into schools , sporting events or government offices			1
dangerous ? ' i hope to make it back up the lst , but i 'll settle for 14			0
it was a good run ' , says @entity10 production : in an instruction video , the @entity6 printed gun is shown being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home process : video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each part was printed and cleaned			1

@entity10 does not believe he is dangerous despite building a weapon that is unable to be seen by metal detectors
pistol uses only one metal piece - a small nail for the firing pin
blueprints for the weapons were downloaded 100,000 times over two days when they were online in may
