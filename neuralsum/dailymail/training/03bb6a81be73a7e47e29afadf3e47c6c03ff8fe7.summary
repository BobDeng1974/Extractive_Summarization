militants have forced a college to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils			1
the u-turn came in the face of a planned mass demonstration against ‘ @entity8 ’ and an online petition signed by 9,000			1
the niqab ban had been in place at @entity12 for eight years without protest			1
but an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper , saying she was being discriminated against			0
@entity12 had banned students from wearing burkas for eight years before the turn around this week when the story broke it sparked claims of racism and even rumours that the college was planning to ban prayer on its premises			1
late on thursday , the college climbed down and ‘ modified ’ the ruling against veils , hoodies and hats , which had been brought in to ensure students were always ‘ easily identifiable ’			1
@entity31 , the left - wing student activist who organised the 9,000 - name petition , is best known for opposing the extradition of hate preacher @entity34			1
he was also forced to apologise for defending the @entity36 rioters of 2009 and has suggested the police are institutionally racist			0
last night @entity39 mp @entity38 , who is championing a law to ban face coverings in public , said he was sorry the college had ‘ caved in ’			2
and @entity44 stepped in to the row to reveal that @entity46 would back a ban on @entity49 veils at his children ’s school			1
the prime minister is being pressured to give headteachers more protection against similar backlashes			0
the college , which is the third largest in the @entity57 , with 44,000 students , insisted the policy was designed to protect students			2
staff at @entity12 , pictured , said in the past the rules were in place for ' security reasons ' it stopped female @entity49 pupils from wearing the niqab , the full facial veil in which only the eyes are visible , or the burqa where the eye area is covered in mesh			1
the policy was attacked by local councillors , mps and the @entity76 , headed by mr @entity31			0
mr @entity46 had backed the college ’s original decision to enforce the uniform code			1
but deputy prime minister @entity80 admitted on thursday he was ‘ uneasy ’ about the ban and believed the bar had to be set ‘ very high ’ to justify any prohibition on wearing a veil			1
more than 800 people were expected to attend a protest yesterday , however late on thursday night the college posted a statement on its @entity90 page			2
it said teachers were concerned that media attention was ‘ detracting from our core mission of providing high quality learning ’			0
it added : ‘ as a consequence , we will modify our policies to allow individuals to wear specific items of personal clothing to reflect their cultural values			0
‘ the college will still need to be able to confirm an individual ’s identity in order to maintain safeguarding and security			2
’ the college said it was confident this would ‘ meet the needs of all of our learners and stakeholders ’			0
mr @entity31 , 24 , yesterday thanked supporters , adding : ‘ we ca n’t be complacent though as prime minister @entity46 signalled that he supported the college ’s decision to ban students from wearing veils			1
‘ that is why we must always be ready to unite together to defend our fundamental human rights to freedom of thought , conscience , religion and cultural expression			0
’ however , mr @entity46 ’s spokesman said the government would defend the right of headteachers to decide on school uniform			1
two @entity49 students at the @entity12 campus in @entity133 , @entity134 , pictured before the ban which ruled students to keep their eyes , nose and mouth visible at all times he added : ‘ there ’s an important point here around headteachers and their leadership teams being able to take the decisions that are right for their schools and we will continue to support that			1
it ’s a very important principle			2
’ when asked if mr @entity46 would be happy to see a ban on the veil in his children ’s schools , he replied : ‘ that would apply to every school , every single one , including the ones that his children may attend			1
what ’s important is to back the right of schools to set their own uniform policy and that ’s what the government will keep doing			1
’ mr @entity46 ’s nine - year - old daughter @entity166 , and seven - year - old son @entity167 , attend a @entity169 junior school in @entity36			1
in a key 2007 case , a high court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class			0
afterwards , the @entity176 issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full - face veils on grounds of security , safety or learning			1
mr @entity38 , who refuses to meet constituents who wear the veil , said stronger guidelines need to be introduced to help schools			2
split : @entity46 backed schools and colleges to enforce uniform rules but @entity80 said he felt ' uneasy ' about telling people what they should wear ‘ the government should republish them , ’ he added			1
‘ the shame is that this school have done a u-turn when their original decision would have been roundly supported by most people who read the @entity202			2
‘ i recently read about a teacher who sent home those pupils who were not dressed properly			0
that ’s the kind of robust leadership we need in our schools			1
’ @entity12 is believed to be the only college in the @entity57 to have banned the niqab			1
some 43 per cent of its students come from ethnic groups that are non-white			2
of these , 14 per cent are from @entity49 @entity215			0
this week , the college refused to be drawn into discussion on why the ban was introduced , but one student ’s story is that it was brought in after a group wearing niqabs entered the college and attacked a pupil			1
the 17 - year - old who started the protest told the @entity202 the veil ban was ‘ disgusting ’			1
she added : ‘ it ’s a personal choice and i find it absolutely shocking that this has been brought in at a college in @entity231 when the city is so multicultural and so many of the students are @entity49			1
‘ it upsets me that we are being discriminated against			0
i do n’t think my niqab prevents me from studying or communicating with anyone			0
’ tension quickly spread across the college ’s eight campuses			2
a group of white male students at one of the sites said they were worried			2
‘ this is causing tension , not just with the @entity49 girls , but with the boys too , ’ said one			0
‘ the lads are proud to be @entity49 and feel this is discrimination against the girls			0
the situation is getting out of hand			0
’ but one of his friends said : ‘ i support the ban			0
i have no problem with people of other cultures coming to this country – i just think they should play by our rules			0
’ another young man said : ‘ how would people like it if i came into college wearing a balaclava ? ’ mr @entity31 lives in @entity269 , @entity270 , where he is a local councillor as well as being the full - time black students ’ officer for the @entity273 on £ 20,000 a year			1
case by case : schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases			1
in a key 2007 case , a high court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class			0
although the 12 - year - old ’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in @entity296 , teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her			0
they said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention , engaged with her work or distressed			0
after the case , the government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full - face veils on grounds of security , safety or learning			2
it said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils			0
schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders , it added			0
but rather than a @entity324 - style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces , the @entity322 said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation			0
updated government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face - coverings			2
it says it is ‘ still lawful ’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘ health , safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others ’			0
and religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘ at any time , in any place , or in any particular manner , ’ the guidance adds .			0
