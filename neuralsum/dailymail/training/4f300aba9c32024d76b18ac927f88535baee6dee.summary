mr @entity5 's @entity27 has blasted the government - backed contrator for ' pushing him ' before he died			1

' he added that he was an extremely vulnerable and fragile individual who was struggling to cope with life			0
mr @entity5 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , had suffered for years from obsessive compulsive disorder , @entity12 's syndrome , phobias of food , pollution , paint fumes , and social situations , and cognitive behavioural problems			1

there is no treatment for the condition and very little research on medication that is used by sufferers			0
most people with @entity12 's are prescribed a programme of behavioural therapy			1
' they have reversed the decision - that is huge but they obviously had the information at their disposal to make the right decision and if they had done that last march @entity5 would not be dead			0
' it is good because it hopefully means we can now get some answers			0
' ms @entity67 and her mother @entity103 appealed against the benefit cut earlier this month , acting on advice from @entity106 ( @entity106 )			2
today , they received a letter from the @entity21 saying it had ' revised ' its decision to cut mr @entity5 's benefits			1
a spokesman said : ' the coroner attributed mr @entity5 's eating disorder and food phobia as the likely cause of his death , rather than his benefits being stopped			2
' however , after receiving new evidence from @entity5 's gp which was not presented at the first assessment , we have revised our original decision			2
' we have written to mr @entity5 's family about this decision and are carrying out an internal review			1
' @entity8 made £ 111.76m pounds operating profit in 2013			0
ms @entity67 added : ' i think it is good that @entity8 has withdrawn but it is only part of the story - the whole system needs to be looked at			0
' @entity133 , joint manager of @entity106 , said : ' mr @entity5 lived in @entity59 's constituency and this happened			1
' we are very sorry this had had to come to light from his death			0
there could be other cases in which people have died too			0
we know there are hundreds of decisions which are not right			0
' ' tragic ' : @entity59 has spoken out about the ' tragic ' case in his constituency and backed a review between january 2012 and january this year @entity106 took 312 cases to appeals against @entity21 decisions and 281 were successful			1
mr @entity59 said : ' this is a tragic case and my thoughts are with mr @entity5 's family at this difficult time			1
' the decision means the family does n't have to take the appeal to court			0
@entity161 , mp for @entity162 and @entity163 , said : ' this has been a tragic case and while this decision will not bring @entity5 back at least it sets the record straight			2
' i have been very clear with the @entity21 that , in my view , @entity5 's case was badly mishandled by @entity8 and that the family 's appeal needed to be dealt with as a matter of urgency and i am pleased they agreed			1
' i also welcome thursday 's announcement that the government 's contract with @entity8 to conduct these assessments has been terminated early			0
