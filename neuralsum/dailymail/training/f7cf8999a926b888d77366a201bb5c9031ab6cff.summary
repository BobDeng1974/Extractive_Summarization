just a few short years ago , long , straight hair was everywhere you looked			1
from the catwalk to the red carpet and the high street , flicky locks and honeyed highlights were everywhere			0
now , thanks to @entity9 and other celebrities willing to brave the chop , things have changed			0
from pink hair to undercuts , pixie crops , fringes and ombre , @entity13 's streets are awash with different colours , shapes and styles			2
but your choice of cut says more about you than you realise - and plays a huge role in the way you feel about yourself			0
@entity26 : @entity27 and @entity28 both have haircuts that conceal their personalities masculine : short haired women like @entity34 and @entity35 are widely regarded as slightly manly ' hair is called a secondary sexual characteristic , ' says leading trichologist @entity38			1
' you ca n't flaunt your primary sexual characteristics in public , at least not in western society , so that 's what makes your hair important from a social viewpoint			1
' it 's about sexuality and morale			0
lots of women - and men - find that if they are not happy with their hair , then they are unhappy people			1
' and it 's precisely because hair is a secondary sexual characteristic that long , glossy hair - which denotes youth and fertility - has been so popular for so long			1
as a result , short , cropped styles are widely considered masculine , according to @entity64 , a professor of critical theory at the @entity66 and editor of @entity68 : women and body hair			1
' short hair is still equated with masculinity , ' she revealed in an interview with the @entity75			1
' i have very short hair and in @entity78 , i often get mistaken for a man			1
that never happens to me on the continent - for instance in @entity83 and @entity84 , where a lot of these societies are more egalitarian and matriarchal			0
' but despite the explosion in different styles ( ' it 's not one iconic haircut anymore , ' reveals award - winning stylist , @entity94 ) , long , glossy locks not only remain the default option for many , they 're also seen as the most glamorous			0
likeable : @entity96 of @entity97 and @entity98 boast glossy wavy hair - and are liked as a result zany : women who make bold colour choices such as @entity104 and @entity105 are regarded as quirky straight - unexpressive bright colour - quirky fringe - individual @entity106 - likeable long - glamorous short - masculine according to fashion historian @entity108 , the dominant trend today is for styling rather than cutting and for ' long , glamorous hair and lots of it			1
' it 's a look that cuts across social classes and is as likely to be spotted on @entity114 stars as it is on royalty , albeit with a few crucial differences			0
from the @entity126 and @entity98 ' blow - dried locks - in both cases the mark of a woman with the time and money to spend on her hair - to @entity119 and @entity121 ' extravagant extensions , long hair is glamorous no matter what			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , the @entity13 is now the third - largest importer of human hair in the world , with Â£ 38m worth entering the country every year			2
' it 's a traditional idea of female glamour and it 's kind of boring , ' adds @entity108			0
' it 's the whole pole dancer look : huge heads of artificial hair , faces that look like they 've been dipped in a bucket of make - up , ultra short skirts and huge stripper heels			1
' in terms of fashion and feminism , it 's like " oh my @entity149 , what was i fighting for ? " ' nevertheless , long ' natural ' hair that waves or curls is seen as likeable , and in @entity155 and the @entity126 's case , demure			2
individual : those who plump for fringes like @entity159 and @entity160 know what they like and dislike colour too is changing , with blondeness - once regarded as a signifier of youth - becoming dated thanks to the large numbers of older women who wear it			1
' @entity170 used to be a sign of youth , ' adds @entity108			0
' now because so many women post- 50 are dyeing their hair blonde , it 's a sign of maturity and young women are increasingly dyeing their hair in a grey tone that 's almost silver or pale blue			2
' ultimately , we 're slowly moving away from the identikit blonde , straightened look that dominated the noughties and @entity94 , in particular , is thrilled			0
' people used to embrace having the same haircut as @entity28 , ' he explains			0
' now there are 20 or 30 new trends and individuality is so much more important			0

women with wavy or curly hair are *perceived* as being likeable and *friendly*
those with short hair like @entity35 are regarded as being masculine
according to @entity200 , hair is a secondary sexual characteristic
as a result , it can have an impact on self - esteem and the partners we *attract*
