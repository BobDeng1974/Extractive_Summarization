have you ever booked that ' executive junior suite ' at a hotel , only to arrive to find a broom cupboard with a view of an air conditioning unit ? according to new research , 48 per cent of @entity6 have had to request to move after check - in when discovering the room is a far cry from what they saw on the website			1
responding to poll results that suggest that one in five @entity6 travellers admit their holiday has been ruined by anxiety over whether to ' suffer in silence ' or getting up the nerve to complain , @entity14 have come up with a solution			2
choose your own room : thistle hotel has launched a service allowing guests to select where they stay the chain 's @entity28 hotel in @entity30 has just launched a free ' @entity22 ' online service			1
with 88 per cent of @entity6 saying they 'd prefer to select what room they stay in , @entity14 's solution to ' room anxiety ' allows guests to take a 360 ° virtual tour of their selected room when booking			1
much like pre-selecting your seat on a plane , travellers can view photographs of a specific room prior to checking in , including the view , and make a change if it does n't meet their needs			0
on the brochure : have you ever booked a room , expecting it to look like this ... reality : ... only to arrive to find this ? four in ten of those polled admit to feeling anxious about their hotel room before arriving , fearing it wo n't be what they paid for , while nearly a third have quietly requested to be given rooms away from work colleagues on business trips			2
the ' @entity65 ' service aims to prevent any awkwardness for customers in such circumstances			0
@entity69 , chief operating officer from @entity14 , says : ‘ we know @entity71 hate to complain , so concerns about causing a fuss if we do n’t like the room we ’re allocated really can spoil a stay for many			0
innovative : @entity14 's @entity28 hotel is allowing guests to preview specific rooms before booking ' guests often opt to stay in the same bedroom if they ’ve stayed with us before , so we ’re simply putting them in control by inviting guests who book direct on @entity85 to use the ‘ @entity65 ’ service			1
' our ambition is that all @entity14 hotels across the @entity6 will have the @entity22 service and we are working on rolling this out now			2
’ ' do n't want to cause a fuss ' : with @entity71 known for avoiding complaints , the service prevents awkward conversations with reception staff behavioural psychologist @entity96 added : ‘ complaining really is n’t in our national psyche so the anticipation of not liking our room , or even worse , it not meeting our partner ’s expectations really can make @entity6 feel anxious and out of control – particularly when they are outside familiar surroundings and away from home			0
' airlines have long put us in control before check in by letting us choose our own seats , so if we are staying the night somewhere , a system where travellers can really visualise where they ’ll be waking up is a big move forward which should help combat first night nerves and help many relax into their trip without being worried about a row			0

almost half of @entity6 have requested to move rooms
one in five say ' room anxiety ' has ruined a holiday
@entity14 's online service gives 360 *degree* tour of hotel room
much like selecting plane seats , guests can book specific rooms
