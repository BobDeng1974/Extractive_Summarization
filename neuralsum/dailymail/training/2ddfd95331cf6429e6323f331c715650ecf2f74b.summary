by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:50 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 10 october 2012 @entity3 's yet - to - be - announced @entity2 has apparently been revealed in full for the first time in the best set of pictures yet leaked on the internet			1
@entity8 , a researcher for fansite 9to5mac.com , published the images on his @entity12 feed yesterday , sparking a wave of excitement among @entity3 enthusiasts			2
the images show a device that is significantly smaller than the regular @entity2			1
according to rumours it boasts a 7.85in liquid crystal display , making it a rival to @entity23 's @entity22 and @entity25 's @entity24			1
is this the finished @entity2 ? this picture , published to @entity12 , appears to show the completed version of @entity3 's hotly anticipated new device the mini is thought to be 7in diagonally , compared to the 9.7in of the full - size ipad			1
this would allow it to be used easily on public transport , and fit into a ( large ) jacket pocket			0
@entity36 is predicting the mini - which some are dubbing the @entity2 nano - will use a 1,024 x 768 pixel panel			1
the images also show the @entity2 utilises the controversial new connector introduced with the @entity43 , which has made all accessories available to previous @entity3 gadgets obsolete at a stroke			1
it emerged yesterday that @entity3 had instructed suppliers in @entity49 to manufacture 10million of the new smaller tablet computers , showing faith in their product in the face of stiff competition			1
insiders say the @entity2 will be announced on october 17 , a few days from the releases of @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity58 's surface tablets , and go on sale november 2			1
as yet , however , @entity3 has not officially confirmed any of the reports , rumours of leaks about a smaller @entity2			1
@entity3 's 9 - inch device dominates the market , but smaller , cheaper tablets have been eating away at the @entity2 's popularity			1
the ipad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on november 2nd , according to online speculation			0
changes : this picture , leaked by the same source , compares the new connector on the @entity2 with the old version as seen on previous versions of the @entity2 the launch date was reported by @entity78 , which cites @entity3 investors hearing the date from ' multiple sources '			1
the device is believed to have similar hardware to last year 's @entity2 , but reduced to a pocket - friendly seven or eight - inch form			1
@entity85 plans to unveil a smaller version of its popular @entity88 smartphone , pictured right , in @entity89 tomorrow			2
it will be very similar to the original , but will feature a 4in screen , placing it in in direct competition with the @entity43 , which also has a 4in screen			2
@entity85 's original @entity88 , unveiled in late may , has a 4.8 - inch screen			2
strong sales of the flagship phone helped @entity85 post record $ 7.3billion operating profit between july and september			0
' we think there 's strong demand for 4 - inch screen models in @entity89 , ' @entity100 , head of its mobile business , as said today			2
there had been market speculation that @entity85 would launch a stripped out , cheaper version of the @entity88 to win market share in the mid- to low - end smartphone segment			2
however , @entity85 said the @entity113 would not be an entry - level model			0
@entity78 reports that @entity3 will send out invites for the launch on october 10 , gathering tech journalists and stakeholders together to unveil the device			1
@entity25 , meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the @entity121 with its updated @entity123 tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time on the 25th october			0
the gadgets , are available in both 7 - inch and 8.9 - inch versions ( although only the 7 - inch version is currently set to go o sale outside of the @entity121 )			1
the third contender is @entity58 , with its surface tablets			0
the firm will launch the surface tablet at the same time as @entity134 , the latest version of its desktop operating system , which experts say is a ' make or break ' time for the firm			0
' it 's a dangerous game , as all three firms are trying to steal each other 's thunder , ' said @entity143 of gadget @entity144			2
' @entity3 tend to be more cagey			0
' if i was @entity3 , and knew that @entity58 was launching , i 'd probably try and come up with something to take the focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way @entity3 can			2
' @entity153 believes that @entity58 has so far played its cards close to its chest with the surface tablet			0
the firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget			0
the @entity2 launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per cent - own a tablet , with another three per cent regularly borrowing someone else 's tablet for web browsing			1
about 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year			0
the @entity121 survey by the @entity170 also suggests the flood of cheaper tablets , such as the @entity173 or @entity24 , are weakening @entity3 's grip on the market			1
a year ago , @entity3 had more than 80 per cent of the market , but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent			0
the @entity24 has 21 per cent of the market , meanwhile @entity85 's @entity178 tablet has eight per cent			2
out of those surveyed , 44 per cent of adults who said they have a smartphone , 46 per cent have an @entity182 phone , 38 per cent , have an @entity43 and 10 per cent have a @entity183			2
' @entity58 is the most interesting - it 's a make or break thing for them , as they have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces			0
' it has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the @entity2			1
' however , it is @entity3 's ipad mini that is expected to attract most attention			2
' the ipad mini is potentially huge , ' said @entity153			0
' but a lot will depend on price			0
there are a lot of people who would like an @entity2 but ca n't afford one , so if it does launch and is £ 250 , it will be very difficult for anyone to beat			0
' experts also believe that @entity25 's @entity24 , which is being launched outside the @entity121 for the first time , could be let down if not enough content is available			2
the gadget uses @entity25 's own app and film and book stores			0
' @entity24 is a difficult one , especially in the @entity210 , ' said @entity153			0
' it is dependent on its content delivery , and they will have to have a lot of @entity210 content at launch for it to work - but @entity24 is a very strong brand now			2
. however , @entity153 also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers			0
' it is quite possible consumers will get confused , ' he said			0
' after the @entity43 launched , a lot of competitors came out , and people did get confused			0
most secrecy has surround the @entity2 , a shrunken version of @entity3 's market - changing tablet , is expected to launch on october 17 , with the device available in shops on november 2			1
@entity230 famously ruled on a smaller @entity2 , saying ' the current crop of 7 - inch tablets are going to be @entity233 , dead on arrival			1
' we do n't think you can make a great tablet with a 7 - inch screen			0
' however , devices like the @entity240 and @entity23 's @entity22 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport , causing @entity3 to reportedly change its mind on an ' ipad mini ' with a 7 or 8 inch screen			1
the firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices , which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector			2
if @entity3 follows previous form , the event will be held in @entity257 , with a simultaneous launch on @entity259			0
images purporting to show the @entity2 suggest a device measuring 7.85inches , with an aluminium back - cover similar to the most recent @entity2			1
it is likely to sport a rear - facing camera and come with @entity3 's newest ' lightning ' connector , a controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers obsolete without an adapter			1
if @entity3 follows its usual design styles , it is likely to come in white and black versions , with a choice of @entity277 only , or a @entity279 option			0
the device , while still likely to garner a premium price - tag , will help @entity3 compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market			1
the 7 - inch @entity173 tablet sells for £ 159 for the cheapest version , while @entity25 is also producing a budget tablet range			0
@entity230 was unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success , seeing it as a poor compromise between a tablet and a phone			0
however @entity3 appears to have had a change of heart , particularly now that the tablet market has now matured			0
one issue @entity3 might face by launching a @entity2 is a fragmentation in its core product lines			1
until the release of the @entity43 , @entity3 's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution , meaning apps did not need redesigning for different devices , a problem that plagues the competing @entity182 platform			1
but with the increased screen size of the @entity43 , some apps now have a black border , at least until the developers update their apps , and this problem may now afflict @entity3 's tablets , depending on the final size of the @entity2 .			1

pictures show device that is significantly smaller than the regular @entity2
