at the beginning of february 2012 , a spate of injuries forced the @entity3 to promote a little - known basketball player called @entity5 to their starting roster			1
@entity5 had looked as though he was destined for a career as a journeyman			1
he was struggling to make it to the big time			1
@entity13 teams had turned their backs on him until the @entity3 were forced to give him a chance			2
@entity5 , who was struggling financially and sleeping on a friend ’s couch , played well in his first match			2
he outscored his more illustrious team - mates			2
the struggling @entity3 embarked on a winning streak			2
@entity24 's meteoric rise continued on friday when he marked his first @entity26 game with a goal @entity24 headed in @entity26 's fourth against @entity28 shortly after replacing @entity29 @entity24 's progress is reminiscient of @entity5 's form when he was playing basketball for the @entity3 @entity5 propelled the @entity3 to a winning streak but failed to recapture his form after sustaining an injury by the end of the first week , celebrities were flocking to courtside at @entity38 to catch the buzz			1
@entity5 became a phenomenon and the mania that developed around him was given a name : @entity43			2
it seemed then that @entity5 could never again return to ordinariness			2
but in mid-march , the coach who had given him his chance was fired and @entity5 sustained a knee injury that ended his season			2
he was traded to another team in the summer			2
they offloaded him to the struggling @entity52 , where he has also failed to make an impact			2
he is known now only for his failure to sustain @entity43			0
‘ i feel like i ’m back to square one , ’ he said last week			0
you get the point ? well , you would have done if you had been at @entity58 on friday night , heard the deafening , rumbling cheer that rolled around the stadium when @entity24 ran on to make his @entity26 debut and witnessed the scenes when , 79 seconds later , he scored with a far - post header			1
this is @entity67 football ’s @entity43			0
in the middle of what is , in many ways , a fairly unremarkable domestic football season , we have become caught up in our very own intoxicating , uplifting kind of madness			0
‘ it ’s nice when fairytales come true , ’ said the @entity26 manager @entity75 afterwards , beaming into the camera			1
‘ it ’s the start that i dreamed of , ’ he said			0
the @entity28 manager , @entity80 , described the @entity81 forward as a ‘ sniper ’			0
even @entity29 , whose limelight had been stolen by the 21 - year - old , seemed a little breathless			0
‘ it ’s incredible really , ’ @entity29 said of @entity24 ’s impact			1
‘ you can feel the excitement all around the country			0
’ and so a kid who looked like he might be heading for a career in the lower divisions is suddenly taking our league , and now our national team , by storm			0
what is unfolding in front of us seems so wonderfully unlikely that it has reached the point where it is scarcely credible			0
late on friday night , the @entity102 displayed a map of the world showing where social media reaction to @entity24 ’s goal had been at its height			1
the yellow dots showing maximum interaction were spread from @entity26 to @entity110 to @entity111 to @entity112 and @entity113			1
@entity29 ( right ) praised @entity24 's impact with @entity81 and now at international level kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for @entity26 against @entity28 at @entity58 on friday @entity24 was sent on loan to a number of football league sides before breaking through to the @entity81 side this is a kid who was shunted around the lower leagues to @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 while @entity81 tried to work out what to do with him and whether he was good enough to make the grade with them			1
this is a kid , an @entity67 kid , a local north @entity133 kid , whose meteoric rise has coincided with immigration leaping to the top of the political agenda and concerns about the proliferation of foreign players and owners in our leagues			1
when @entity81 fans sing that @entity24 is ‘ one of our own ’ , their boast represents not just a celebration of his talent but a lament for a time when they could identify more closely with the players they were watching			1
in an age where teams are being taken away from the fans , @entity24 represents a reconnection			1
the mania that has grown around him is a warning that there are those who harbour misgivings about the cosmopolitan make - up of the @entity165			0
riding along on @entity24 ’s coat - tails , @entity167 chairman @entity166 has quickly and adroitly tapped into those fears and prejudices and seized the moment to propose that every @entity165 club should have 12 home - grown players in its 25 - man squad			1
@entity24 is at the centre of all this but as he walked triumphantly from the pitch on friday night , the next question is how long can he maintain this trajectory ? is this his natural orbit , is he here to stay or is this , like @entity43 , some brief enchantment ? the media , of course , is already being accused of building a kid up just so it can knock him down but @entity24 is fortunate that in his club boss , @entity189 , and @entity75 , he has two managers who will shepherd him wisely			1
‘ we ’re not going to hold him back , ’ said @entity75			0
‘ there ’s no question of that			0
but on the other hand , i am rather hoping i have got @entity24 for a long period to come and i do n’t want to be the one who throws him in and he flies too close to the sun. ’ did the @entity26 manager give any thought to the idea that @entity24 might fall back into the shadows ? ‘ i suppose when someone has shone quite so brilliantly , that is always in the back of your mind , ’ @entity75 said			1
‘ but i have got to say that from what i have seen of him , from what i know of the apprenticeship he has already served , when i look at the qualities he possesses as a football player , i have got no fears in that respect			0
i do n’t believe it will happen			0
@entity75 believes that @entity24 will be able to maintain his astonishing standard of form @entity24 is in line to feature for @entity26 in a friendly against @entity226 in @entity227 on tuesday @entity26 manager @entity75 is pleased with how @entity24 is being handled at @entity81 by @entity189 ‘ i still think it is prudent for @entity189 and myself , as the @entity26 manager , not to stand here in front of you singing his praises			1
you are singing his praises enough , so just allow me to dampen them down a little bit			0
’ it probably wo n’t do much good			0
the @entity238 is setting off for @entity227 on tuesday , full steam ahead			1
whether this is all @entity43 or whether , as we all hope , it is something more substantial and lasting , we will soon find out .			0
