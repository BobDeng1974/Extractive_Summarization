by @entity0 and @entity1 promise : @entity3 has said he will reduce net migration to ' tens of thousands ' a huge majority of voters want @entity3 to defy the @entity7 and maintain controls on @entity10 and @entity11 migrants			1
in an explosive @entity13 survey , eight out of ten said they did not want citizens of the two countries to be handed free access to @entity19 jobs from january 1			2
ministers warn @entity19 will be taken to court if it ignores the @entity23 edict to let the migrants in			1
but the threat of big fines from the @entity27 was brushed off by almost two thirds of the public			2
they said that – even if it meant legal sanctions – the prime minister should keep the restrictions in place to ‘ serve the national interest ’			2
and 80 per cent of voters say @entity38 should retain the final say over who enters the country			2
only 5 per cent think @entity23 should be in charge			1
an overwhelming 85 per cent said migration was putting too much pressure on schools , hospitals and housing			1
the findings of the @entity50 poll , conducted earlier this week , will heap further pressure on @entity52 to stop a potentially major influx from @entity10 and @entity11			1
although officials have refused to predict how many will come , the @entity55 think - tank puts the figure as high as 70,000 a year			1
that would almost certainly wreck mr @entity3 ’s promise to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
in a devastating blow for the @entity66 , our poll reveals that only 11 per cent trust the @entity67 on immigration – six percentage points less than @entity70 and 11 less than @entity71			2
but , in a stark indictment of the whole political class , a disturbing 44 per cent have no trust in any party on this most serious of issues			2
the prime minister has repeatedly pointed to the fact that net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the @entity19 , and those leaving – is down by a third , to 176,000 , since 2010			1
but , in the @entity13 ’s survey , 80 per cent said this figure was still too many			2
the findings are scathing about @entity70 ’s record in office			2
two thirds of the public agreed with former @entity70 home secretary @entity91 ’s statement that throwing open the doors to @entity93 and other @entity94 in may 2004 had been a ‘ spectacular mistake ’			2
an astonishing 79 per cent of the voters said they had not been properly consulted over the open door immigration policies pursued by the last government , which added 2.5million to the @entity19 ’s population			1
asked if the impact of mass immigration had been good for @entity19 society as a whole , only 19 per cent said yes , while 64 per cent said no. four in ten said immigration had changed their community for the worse , compared with only 11 per cent who said it was better			0
seventy - six per cent say it has affected the ability of young @entity19 to get a job			0
yet , in results which will alarm @entity116 strategists , @entity114 ’s party scores better than mr @entity3 ’s on immigration policy			0
support : respondents agreed with former home secretary @entity91 , who said opening the borders would be a ' mistake ' while immigration minister @entity123 said there would not be an influx in january asked who they trust most , 22 per cent of voters picked @entity71 , 17 per cent @entity70 , 11 per cent the @entity67 , and 4 per cent the @entity127			1
the poll shows older people are particularly concerned about net migration : 72 per cent of 16 to 24 - year - olds said it was too high compared with more than 90 per cent of those aged over 55			1
an extraordinary 95 per cent of those in this older age group were in favour of continuing restrictions after january 1			0
mr @entity3 will now find himself under intense pressure from worried @entity116 mps to act over @entity10 and @entity11			1
the two countries joined the @entity7 in 2007 , but were subject to so - called transitional controls			0
this meant only the self - employed and those given permits to carry out low - skilled agricultural work , such as fruit picking , could join the @entity19 jobs market			0
ministers have kept the transitional controls in place for the maximum period			0
but , under @entity7 rules , the arrangements must be lifted on january 1			0
any failure to do so would be considered a breach of the free movement directive – a founding principle of the @entity7			0
@entity19 would most likely face heavy fines , but the @entity27 – the @entity7 ’s enforcement arm – is notoriously slow moving			0
sovereignty : only 5 % of the people surveyed said they though @entity23 should have control over policy @entity116 mps believe the 2015 general election may even have passed before a verdict is handed down			1
mr @entity3 ’s main problem with defying @entity23 is that he would face ferocious protests from his @entity127 partners			1
he would also face objections from the @entity170 which wants the @entity19 to honour its international treaty obligations			0
on wednesday , immigration minister @entity123 insisted @entity19 will not face a flood of migrants from @entity10 and @entity11 when controls lapse in the @entity175			1
but he insisted he was ‘ not complacent ’ about potential problems and pointed to measures to limit access to social housing and benefits			0
he rejected comparisons between next year ’s changes and 2004 – when @entity70 opened up the borders to eight @entity185 countries – including @entity93			0
then , officials predicted just 13,000 migrants a year would come but more than a million have arrived			1
mr @entity123 said there was a ‘ big difference ’ between then and now because migrants will be lured to @entity190 by the jobs there and to other countries with larger @entity10 and @entity11 populations			1
camps : @entity197 staff and police round up @entity10 living in @entity199 earlier this year			1
the migrants will be allowed more access to @entity19 jobs and welfare from january 1 concerns over the likely scale of immigration from the two countries – whose combined population is 29million – this week prompted @entity116 backbenchers to demand the controls be extended			1
@entity212 , the mp for @entity213 , proposed extending them until the end of 2018			0
but mr @entity123 said this would be a breach of @entity7 treaties signed by the last @entity70 government – and would lead to court action			0
he said : ‘ it simply is n’t legally possible			0
the accession treaties only give us the ability – and the other eight counties with transitional controls – to extend them to the end of the year			0
‘ the only way you could legally extend them is if you amended the accession treaties , which you would have to do by unanimity including getting the agreement of @entity10 and @entity11 and i do n’t think that is at all possible			1
’ this week it was revealed that colleges have been hit with a surge in applications from @entity10 and @entity11 wanting taxpayer - funded loans and grants to study in this country			1
a total of 5,000 individuals – or one in six of all applicants to vocational courses in @entity248 – were from the two countries			0
many will be entitled to up to £ 10,000 in taxpayer - funded grants and loans			0
fears of fraud prompted ministers to put all applications from the @entity7 on hold			0
last night , a @entity258 spokesman said : ‘ for more than a decade @entity70 failed to control immigration and allowed the number of migrants coming to @entity19 to soar to record highs			2
‘ this government has taken decisive steps to clear up @entity70 ’s mess			0
we have cut net migration by a third in just over three years , closed dozens of bogus colleges and imposed a cap on migrant workers from outside the @entity7			2
