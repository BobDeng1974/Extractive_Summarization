by @entity0 last updated at 11:58 pm on 12th december 2011 the drugs do n't work : many people expect a course of antibiotics to clear up bouts of cystitis - but new strains are becoming more resistant to medication @entity9 was far from worried when she experienced the first symptoms of cystitis			1
‘ i ’d had it once before a few years ago , and knew a quick course of antibiotics would clear it up , ’ says the 36 - year - old account manager from @entity13			2
so @entity9 , whose real name has been changed , took the week - long course of antibiotics prescribed by her gp , and her symptoms disappeared			2
cystitis is a urinary tract infection , most often caused by bacteria			1
around half of all women suffer from it at some time — in fact , cystitis is one of the main reasons for @entity21 antibiotic prescriptions			2
but , in @entity9 ’s case , the treatment did n’t seem to have worked , because just a few weeks later her symptoms returned			2
she was given another course of antibiotics , only for the infection to flare up a month later			2
‘ i was getting worried by then , ’ she says			2
‘ the doctor kept handing out antibiotics , but they did n’t seem to be working			0
’ she went privately to see a specialist , who identified the culprit — a type of @entity47 resistant to a range of common antibiotics			1
most people associate antibiotic resistance with deadly hospital superbugs such as @entity53			0
last month , professor @entity54 of the @entity55 at the @entity56 warned that without new weapons against these dangerous pathogens , we face the threat of untreatable infections			1
but what many people do n’t realise is that resistant strains exist outside hospital , and they can make otherwise innocuous ailments very difficult to @entity67 ’ve become used to the idea that bacterial infections , such as ear or lung infections , can be stopped in their tracks by antibiotics			1
but as @entity9 ’s case shows , that is n’t always true			0
her antibiotics had some effect on the bug causing the infection , but enough resistant ones were left for it to flare up again			1
' i spent 10 days in hospital getting an infusion three times a day ' once @entity9 ’s drug - resistant bug had been identified , ‘ things started to get frightening ’			1
she had to go into hospital for tests to check if the infection had reached her bladder — and the surgeon accidentally cut her bladder wall , so it had to be stitched and she needed a catheter while it healed			0
then , the only treatment that could tackle her resistant bug was a powerful penicillin that had to be delivered directly into a vein			1
‘ i spent ten days in hospital getting an infusion three times a day , ’ recalls @entity9			0
‘ i had tubes coming out of me and was terrified i would catch something else resistant			1
‘ it ’s frightening how fast a resistant bug can take you from healthy to very sick			1
’ around 20 per cent of urinary tract infections cases seen by @entity21 dr @entity108 , a specialist in primary health care at the @entity110 , do n’t respond to the first - line antibiotic , although they do then respond to other antibiotics			1
but urinary tract infections are not the only conditions triggered by drug - resistant bugs			1
nearly 100 cases of resistant pneumonia have been reported in the @entity118 so far			1
and recently there were reports that a strain of the bacteria that causes gonorrhoea had emerged in @entity124 that was resistant to all known antibiotics			1
super bug : a strain of @entity47 resistant to antibiotics has been found in some cases of cystitis so why are n’t there any new drugs to target such bugs ? well , they do n’t make enough profit , so drug companies have stopped researching them			1
there are just four new antibiotics in development worldwide , and none targets resistant bacteria ( 861 more profitable drugs and vaccines are being tested against cancer )			1
the very things that patients like about antibiotics — they work quickly after being taken for only a short time — are what makes them unprofitable			0
@entity152 drugs such as statins make billions because people have to take them for years			0
professor @entity54 ’s solution is to subsidise drug companies to develop new antibiotics			0
she is also heading a campaign to raise awareness among @entity162 and patients , which could result in less antibiotic prescribing			0
@entity162 give out around 80 per cent of antibiotics — all too often for viral infections such as colds and flu , which the drugs ca n’t treat ; they are also hardly effective against infections such as tonsillitis and sinusitis			2
when you treat an infection with an antibiotic , it kills off the harmful , non-resistant bacteria , leaving the resistant ones room to expand			2
there may be other options , according to @entity182 , professor of @entity183 at @entity184			0
‘ cutting back on antibiotics does n’t mean leaving patients with nothing , ’ he says			0
‘ we ’ve found that aspirin - type anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid can be very effective in treating symptoms such as fever , aches and pains			2
’ another approach is better hygiene			0
some years ago @entity53 was infecting 2,000 people every three months in the @entity118 , but the number has dropped below 100 a month thanks to better hygiene			0
‘ improved hygiene can make a big difference , ’ says dr @entity199 of the @entity201 medical school , and an expert in harmful drug effects			0
‘ we also need better , quicker ways of identifying which bacterium a patient is infected with so they can be given an effective drug rather than a broad spectrum antibiotic			0
it is less glamorous than new wonder drugs but it could make a big difference			0
’ it could also save many like @entity9 a lot of misery .			0
