if four @entity4 get killed , it ’s not optimal			1
' he said : ' we ’re going to fix it			0
and what happens , during the course of a presidency , is that the government is a big operation and any given time something screws up and you make sure that you find out what ’s broken and you fix it			0

it recently emerged that the @entity4 government was told that the attack had been carried out by militants , not a spontaneous mob , within just 24 hours of its taking place			1
a diplomatic cable sent the day after the raid suggested that militants had previously planned to attack the consulate , and used the excuse of protests against the @entity221 video as cover for their assault			2
