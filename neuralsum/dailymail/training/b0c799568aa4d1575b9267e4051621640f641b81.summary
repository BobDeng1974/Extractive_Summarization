close : because of the proximity of the houses and the fact that they appear similar at night time , investigators think he may have accidentally gone into the wrong home at the time he was shot lookalikes : the star athlete lived in this @entity45 , @entity47 cul - de sac in the house on the right and may have thought his neighbour 's home was his own according to friends tragic error ? @entity33 , the owner of the house just two doors down ( left ) shot the teen thinking he was an intruder after calling 911 but details are still murky as police continue to investigate for reasons unknown , however , the popular basketball player and promising rapper went to mr @entity33 's house and tried to enter instead of his own			1
some reports suggest that he may have entered through a back window and set off a security alarm			0
though the @entity78 sheriff 's office continues to investigate before confirming details , one law enforcement official told the @entity80 that @entity8 had attempted to walk upstairs where the family were sleeping before he was shot			1
hearing an intruder , mr @entity33 called 911 to report the break - in but by the time authorities reached the property , a large mansion - style two - storey home on the 45900 block of @entity90 , @entity82 was already dead			1

some neighbours admitted that they did n't know the family well and saw other tenants coming and going from the @entity8 home since they had moved in			2
