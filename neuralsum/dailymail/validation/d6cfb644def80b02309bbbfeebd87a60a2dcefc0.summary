@entity0 has confirmed that a representative for @entity2 approached him expressing his client ’s interest to play for the @entity5			1
the @entity7 manager had admitted last summer that he was chasing up a lead with a player at @entity10 and the 21 - year - old was the man in @entity0 ’s sights			1
despite being offered encouragement by @entity2 ’s camp , the striker , whose father was born in @entity15 , insisted in august that his only aim was to break into the senior @entity20 squad			1
and after his breakthrough season in the @entity22 , @entity0 has accepted that the chase to land him is over			1
@entity2 celebrates scoring his second goal as @entity10 beat @entity25 2 - 1 at @entity26 last saturday the @entity20 under 21 striker is also eligible to play for the @entity5 because of his father ‘ yeah , yeah , it is			1
i was talking to somebody about this last night and we were just saying that @entity2 himself always wanted to play for @entity20			1
really , it was as simple as that , ’ he said			2
‘ the order of events – though i do n’t think it ’s really important any more – is that initially the agent got in touch and said that he would have a keen interest , and we wanted to go and chase it up			2
‘ but then i noticed in the newspaper where he said he wanted to play for @entity20			1
and that has remained the same			2
someone was even speaking to him recently and that was exactly the same conversation			2
fine , if that ’s the case			0
’ before @entity2 propelled himself into the limelight , with 26 goals to his name already this season , @entity0 felt it was possible he would opt for @entity7			1
@entity7 boss @entity0 has revealed that @entity2 was interested in representing @entity53 before this season ‘ considering what the agent said to me , ’ he added			1
‘ sometimes what agents do is they have someone who looks after the player who is not actually licensed to buy or sell or be involved as an agent but they look after the player			0
and he was the one who called			0
but he happened to call me on a day when @entity2 said he wanted to play for @entity20			1
‘ it would have been really nice , absolutely			0
there ’s a fairly decent chance he might have had a few caps for us before he actually makes his debut for @entity20 , considering the way he ’s playing			2
’ one @entity2 who will join up with the @entity7 squad for the @entity72 qualifier with @entity73 later this month is @entity74			1
the @entity76 midfielder has impressed as his side top the @entity78 revealed that there will be further additions to his plans in the coming months			0
@entity2 has scored 26 goals so far this season and is on the brink of @entity86 's @entity20 squad ‘ i do n’t want to sound like a detective here but i ’m following up on a number of leads			1
honestly , i think there ’s one or two might come to fruition in the next couple of months , maybe even before the @entity95 game , that might be pleasantly surprising			0
i ’m saying that , maybe i ’m being optimistic			0
‘ if i thought things were really worth chasing up and somebody ’s ... i think sometimes the agent is seemingly almost like an excuse preventing that			0
one particular lad has called me who has bypassed agents and he ’d be pretty keen			0
and i ’m putting something in motion at the moment			0
’ although @entity0 was coy on revealing any names			2
‘ do you know , i ca n’t really at this minute			0
would probably end up embarrassing myself when he turns out and plays for @entity110			0
