by @entity0 published : 18:56 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 20 march 2013 an end to the ban on hunting with dogs has been called for by environment secretary @entity4			1
speaking in an interview , he said ‘ no - one is more keen than me to see the @entity6 repealed because i believe in the management of wildlife ’			0
last year , mr @entity4 , 56 , said he was not expecting a vote on the issue in 2013 , because it was clear the government would lose			2
but speaking to @entity13 , he made his views on the controversial matter perfectly clear.hunting with dogs was outlawed by @entity17 in 2005			0
stance : environment secretary @entity4 has called for the ban on hunting with dogs to be scrapped but in their 2010 manifesto , the @entity20 promised a free @entity23 vote on whether to overturn the ban , but many doubt it will happen because of @entity27 opposition			1
a keen rider , mr @entity4 , the @entity29 mp for @entity30 , is seen as the @entity32 ’s leading supporter of hunting and other country sports			2
to the delight of the farming community , he has controversially given the go - ahead for two pilot badger culls later this year , despite widespread opposition from conservationists and wildlife charities			0
speaking on the issue , he said : ‘ you ’re talking to the only mp who had a pet badger as a child , but in october [ when the cull was first postponed ] , the situation was being portrayed as an either - or - vaccine or cull - and i was a bloodthirsty idiot			0
@entity51 : mr @entity4 says the ban should be repealed because he believes in ' the management of wildlife ' ‘ the vaccine is 10 years away and we ’re heading for total costs to the taxpayer of £ 1billion			1
we all respect the science , and the best examples of that is how culling has worked in @entity63 - where the disease is at an all - time low - @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
’ he has also come out as keen proponent of genetically - modified ( @entity70 ) crops and argues they should be sold in @entity72 , despite consumers concerns about ‘ frankenstein foods ’			1
it is understood he has the firm backing of chancellor @entity77 , who believes @entity70 food could provide opportunities for @entity81 farmers			1
the environment secretary says culling has worked in @entity63 and other developed countries but the @entity85 has highlighted concerns over gm - foods for years - dismissed by mr @entity4 as ‘ complete nonsense ’ - amid fears that tampering with their genes could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health			2
mr @entity4 yesterday vowed to fight to wean farmers off subsidies as part of a massive overhaul of @entity72 ’s costly agriculture policy			2
after late - night talks in @entity99 , mr @entity4 has called for a reduction on @entity102 support in a bid to make the sector more competitive			1
he said : ‘ i ’m pressing for further progress towards an open market that makes farmers less dependent on subsidies			0
