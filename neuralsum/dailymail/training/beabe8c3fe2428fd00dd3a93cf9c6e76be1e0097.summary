by @entity0 relaxed : @entity1 and @entity2 enjoy a springtime stroll together walking arm - in - arm down a @entity6 street , @entity1 and @entity7 team boss @entity2 look every inch the happy couple			1
rumours of a relationship have surrounded the pair for some weeks , but it is only now they seem ready to declare themselves ‘ an item ’			0
but behind this happy picture lies a very upsetting domestic drama			0
for the head of the @entity20 team and heir to @entity23 ’s throne has cast aside his long - term partner , @entity24 , who only gave birth to his daughter , @entity26 , six months ago , in favour of the former @entity28			1
and while the couple have only been seeing each other for a matter of months , @entity29 has learnt the pop star has been keen to strike up a friendship with @entity2 for years – as these pictures show			1
in 2009 , @entity1 attended the @entity36 and was pictured on the arm of @entity23 with @entity2 hovering in the background			1
@entity1 , 41 , is nothing if not determined and two years later she was in @entity40 again			1
this time she had one arm flung around the flamboyant former team owner and @entity44 commentator @entity43 and the other clasping the back of a clearly nervous @entity2			1
leaning away , with at least a foot between them , his expression is something between a smile and a grimace			0
but what a difference another two years and a sense of purpose makes			2
at the 2013 @entity58 @entity36 at @entity59 , the couple are virtually holding hands			0
@entity1 smiles straight into the camera while a much slimmer @entity2 seems happy and relaxed			1
perhaps worryingly , @entity24 was six months pregnant with their daughter at the time			1
it ’s not clear how the relationship between @entity7 ’s best - loved couple descended into difficulties at what should have been a time of such joy			1
but sources says @entity1 had clearly set her sights on the talented and successful sporting boss			1
last night , a friend of @entity2 ’s said she had been following him ' for a few years ’			1
yesterday , @entity24 , a former pub landlady , was closeted behind the gates of the couple ’s sprawling @entity78 mansion where in happier times the couple kept chickens , ducks , dogs and miniature ponies			1
history : @entity1 poses with @entity87 boss @entity23 in 2009 - as @entity2 looks on in the background the 46 - year - old , who must surely be devastated at being supplanted by @entity1 , refused to comment			1
the couple have now separated			0
one crew member who saw @entity1 and @entity2 together at the @entity58 @entity36 last summer said : ‘ it was really weird			1
@entity1 just sort of appeared – i mean appeared everywhere			1
' so after the race , @entity94 was giving an interview and she just wandered into the shot			0
she was n’t supposed to be there and no one was expecting her , but then she was given a microphone and just sort of gatecrashed the interview			0
’ according to those who know him , @entity2 is charming , polite and unfailingly calm – despite being the boss of a 650 - strong workforce and in charge of one of the most high - profile racing teams in the world			1
one colleague said : ‘ he ’s always well mannered , very nice			0
he does n’t swagger around , although @entity24 ’s a bit more aware of her position			1
‘ @entity20 always have parties after the race and she ’s been known to tell people off for carrying a @entity115 in the @entity20 area			1
you often see him just sitting quietly in a corner			0
he seems older than he is			0
’ @entity2 raced in @entity119 , the series one rung below @entity7 before taking over @entity20 in 2005 aged just 31			1
under his stewardship , the @entity123 - based team has enjoyed a spectacular rise , winning virtually every title going in the past four years			1
more recent : a crew member claimed the way the former @entity28 ( centre ) ' wandered into shot ' was ' really weird '			0
also pictured are @entity2 , right , and @entity87 commentator @entity43 ( left ) once asked about the key to his success , @entity2 said : ‘ i never struggle for motivation			1
motivation is something that burns within			0
i think winning becomes addictive			0
‘ it ’s the fear of failure that drives all of us at @entity20			1
@entity7 is such a competitive business that you ca n’t afford to miss a beat			2
i ’m still relatively young and there ’s still an awful lot i want to achieve			0
’ if he does inherit @entity23 ’s empire , @entity2 ’s power will extend far beyond the sporting arena			1
one commentator said : ‘ you ’ve got to understand how much influence @entity36 has			0
‘ @entity23 is the man that shakes @entity152 ’s hand and says yes , we ’ll bring a race to @entity155			2
politicians , @entity157 princes , the world ’s richest businessmen , they all flock to @entity7			2
’ before the split : @entity2 with @entity24 in 2012 the high - octane world of motor - racing is no doubt one that appeals to @entity1 , who experienced global fame with the @entity28 in the 1990s but has never enjoyed the same success since			1
one friend explained : ‘ it ’s as though she ca n’t really accept the @entity28 days are behind her			2
she ’s pretty self - obsessed			0
' she talks about herself in the third person and still thinks she ’s super-famous			0
she was in the @entity172 with a friend of mine and as they were getting on the yacht , she clicked her fingers at one of the guests and said , “ get rid of that man , i ca n’t have paparazzi around			2
’ ’ ‘ apart from the fact he was a guest , not some minion , and she should n’t have been speaking to him like that , it was n’t a paparazzo			0
it was a tourist taking a picture of one of the superyachts			0
’ @entity1 has now been telling friends that ‘ @entity94 ’s the one , ’ although she is notoriously unlucky in love , once admitting : ‘ i think we all know that relationships have n’t been one of my strong points			2
’ previous boyfriends have included @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , who became exasperated by her demands and once said , rather ungallantly : ‘ she turned into a demonic little girl playing with dolls and a tea set			0
she started speaking like a psychotic child and developed this possessed look			0
it was genuinely scaring me			0
’ @entity1 was once engaged to the @entity211 shipping tycoon @entity212 and had brief relationships with coffee entrepreneur @entity214 and screenwriter @entity215 , father of her seven - year - old daughter @entity216			1
the friend said : ‘ the problem with @entity1 is that she ’s sweet but she ’s incredibly intense			1
everything has got to have a meaning			0
she reads a lot of self - help books such as @entity223 and feel the fear and do it anyway			0
and she ’s always on some mad diet or health kick , which is fine but she expects everyone else around her to do it too			0
‘ the only time she ’s not so ‘ ‘ mad ’ ’ is when she ’s around her daughter			2
she is an absolutely devoted mother			0
and i know she wanted a sibling for @entity216			0
she was with her last boyfriend , @entity233 [ cousin of @entity235 ] for about three years and when he finished it she was absolutely devastated			2
’ @entity87 fan : @entity1 pictured again with @entity2 last june at the @entity58 @entity36 at @entity59 @entity1 and @entity2 apparently split for a short while last december while he attempted to rescue his relationship with the mother of his only child			1
@entity1 was said to be devastated			2
but the couple are now back together again and were recently spotted going for a walk with @entity216 near @entity1 ’s @entity6 home			2
it must undoubtedly be a difficult time for the @entity7 figure			2
he had been with @entity24 for 14 years			1
six years his senior , she had been by his side throughout his astonishing ascent while he acted as a stepfather to her two sons from a previous relationship , @entity255 , now 25 and @entity256 , 21			2
@entity24 gave birth to @entity2 ’s child last october , at the @entity259 , @entity260 , while he was away at the @entity261 @entity36			1
he later explained he had hoped to fly home in time but @entity24 went into labour earlier than expected			2
he told reporters at the time : ‘ @entity26 arrived about 3.30am @entity267 time			0
we went out for some karaoke on wednesday and wetted the baby ’s head			0
@entity272 will probably be my biggest challenge			0
’ although that was before he began dating @entity1 .			2
