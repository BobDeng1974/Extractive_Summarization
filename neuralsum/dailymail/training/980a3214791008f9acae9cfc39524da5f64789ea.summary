in the second of a new weekly column , chief sports writer @entity0 gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week , saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver ... what 's hot black boots @entity9 killed it			1
on may 14 , 2014 , the sportswear manufacturer unveiled their ‘ tricks ’ boots			1
' the right boot is pink , the left boot is blue , ' they announced , breathlessly , confirming that @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 would be among those wearing them at the @entity23			2
actually , that ’s not fair			2
they did have one of the leading members of the @entity30 squad signed up , too			2
so that went really well			2
@entity19 wears his colourful @entity9 boots during @entity35 's defeat by @entity36 last week on that day , coloured boots jumped the shark			1
the greatest footballers in the world are meant to look like athletes , not one candelabra short of @entity43			2
at which point , no doubt , the greatest of them all knew exactly how to be special again			2
' black , ' said @entity47			1
' next season , it ’s back to black			1
' and so , at last weekend ’s @entity51 , he revealed his new look			1
being @entity47 , there were of course , individual touches – a large @entity47 embossed in white on the side – but @entity47 has reverted to old school black footwear and so far it has been a winner			1
@entity47 ’s @entity36 outplayed @entity60 and the next day @entity61 scored an injury time equaliser for @entity64 against @entity65 – also in retro black			1
@entity47 - wearing black boots - celebrates after scoring in last weekend 's @entity51 indeed , considering how intimidating @entity68 used to look in black boots and plain black shorts – what the hell was the rest of football thinking prancing around in pink ? these lads liked a bit of black , too			1
even his guy , the first major signing of his brief @entity64 reign , is now playing better under the new guy			1
in the last two matches , @entity85 has brought more out of @entity64 ’s £ 27million midfielder than @entity80 did at any stage last year			1
man of the match against @entity65 , @entity79 is shaping up as a dominant force in the heart of the play , just in time for the derby meeting with @entity95 on sunday			1
@entity79 looked short of confidence under @entity97 , shrinking in his red shirt when he should have been an imposing presence			1
@entity100 is believed to have told @entity101 , the chief executive , that he did not see @entity79 as a @entity64 player and was ready to let him go to @entity103 on loan			1
@entity106 thwarted @entity79 ’s departure – and now he has taken his chance			1
a late equaliser against @entity110 restored his self - belief			2
charged with keeping @entity65 ’s @entity17 quiet last week he did just that , and then won the header to set up @entity64 ’s equalising goal			1
his figures were superb : he ran 12.17km , one kilometre farther than any other player on the pitch , including 70 sprints – more than either of @entity64 ’s overlapping full - backs			1
nine games in , @entity100 he is convinced that @entity123 football requires greater physical qualities – and @entity79 fits that bill			1
after @entity17 , he will be picking on someone his own size this weekend in @entity20			1
@entity79 was outstanding for @entity64 against @entity65 last weekend @entity128 crazy name , crazy guy			1
the crazy guys in @entity132 are the ones who can hit the ball out of the park			2
@entity128 is n’t like that			2
he ’s the one who stops the fun , a pitcher who ties the hitters in knots			2
and he ’s the main reason the @entity142 are @entity142 champions again			2
' the difference , ' said @entity144			2
@entity128 was named @entity146 after the @entity142 beat the @entity147 4 - 3 in a best of seven series			2
he came out of the bullpen to close out the last five innings for no score as the @entity142 won the deciding game 3 - 2			2
so why did n’t he start ? two days earlier , @entity128 had thrown a 117 - pitch shut out			2
no runs , and only four hits			2
that ’s the difference between baseball and cricket			0
one guy can pitch every ball			0
and @entity128 threw in 21 of @entity162 ’s 61 innings			0
in the days when pitchers ’ arms are protected like @entity167 porcelain , that is a stunning record			0
of his 291 pitches , 205 were strikes			0
baseball had become an increasingly discredited sport dominated by steroid - packed big hitters			0
@entity128 has restored it to the old days : the pitcher as king			0
' he ’s a stud , ' said @entity177 , without a trace of envy			0
who ’s @entity177 ? the pitcher he replaced			0
@entity128 throws a pitch during the @entity142 this week @entity128 celebrates with team - mate @entity183 as the @entity142 clinch the @entity142 what ’s not @entity186 's agent good @entity187 , who is advising this guy ? has he got a death wish ? actually , i take that back			1
maybe @entity186 is the headstrong type			1
maybe he wo n’t listen to reason			0
either way , he can certainly pick them			0
@entity186 would appear to have talent			1
he took @entity198 on a record - breaking 43 - game unbeaten run , only to be sacked three months after it ended having lost two games			0
he then spent two fulfilling years at potless @entity202 , where he prevented them losing 8 - 0 at home to @entity205 , which they promptly did the moment they sacked him			0
now @entity186 has returned – at @entity209			1
no , seriously he has			0
he ’s jumped from the second worst team in the @entity211 , to the absolute worst			1
worse than the team that lost 8 - 0 at home to @entity205			0
worse by five whole points			0
@entity209 are the team with the poorest point aggregate – six from 14 matches – in the top seven divisions of @entity123 football			1
at least there was an excuse for the mess at @entity202 : their owner went to prison			0
@entity209 ’s @entity225 is very much at large			1
it comes to something when your football club might be better run from @entity231			1
it is only a pity that @entity234 of @entity235 is no longer around			0
convictions for smuggling , safe - cracking , handling explosives , burglary , theft and tax evasion , and a club that ended up reforming as @entity235 in @entity244 of the @entity245 , after he had left them ruined			1
no doubt @entity186 would love to work with an owner like @entity234			1
@entity186 - sacked by @entity202 earlier this month - is @entity209 's new manager the @entity248 very hot , the @entity248			1
in 2014 , not so much			0
nevertheless , the usual moans have accompanied news that builders @entity251 will need an additional figure of around £ 50m from the public purse to convert the roof of the @entity256 to the satisfaction of @entity258			0
there is annoyance that , under the terms of the deal , the club does not bear the cost			2
the critics are outraged , insisting @entity258 have the deal of the century , a brand new home given to them by the people of @entity270			0
so let ’s walk it through one more time			0
to begin with , this could all have been avoided if the gang of three overseeing the project – @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 – had accepted a football tenant was the only profitable legacy , and had insisted on a design that could be seamlessly converted			0
so this is the story			0
we had to build a stadium			0
the @entity248 are now over			0
there will not be another here any time soon			0
nor will there be sufficient athletics events or pop concerts to support the venue			0
so either the @entity256 finds a regular tenant , or it sits empty , running up enormous maintenance costs , like the @entity294 , until it crumbles into the @entity296			0
this way , we pick up one last tab and then it starts working for us			0
the other way , you pay			0
thank the gang of three for this @entity304			0
@entity305 's @entity256 is being converted to host @entity258 football matches @entity95 we all know what constitutes a crisis for an elite club these days : three games without winning			1
what was a drama after the surrender of a 2 - 0 lead against @entity315 , became a blip with the loss to @entity258 and a full - blown crisis after defeat at home to @entity321			0
lose to @entity64 and it is possible @entity95 will reach headline stage four : meltdown			1
that first result saw them staring at an early @entity329 exit , the second left them trailing @entity65 by four points – and it could have been worse – then @entity321 ’s reserves dumped them from the @entity333			1
the pressure is on @entity335 , with speculation already surrounding his future if @entity95 fail to win a trophy of significance			1
meanwhile , in retirement , sir @entity340 looks like a genius			0
he regularly kept his serial winners at @entity64 hungry with nothing more than a reign of terror			1
@entity335 appears lumbered with dilettantes			0
they thought they had the @entity350 game won , only woke up to @entity258 ’s threat when the second went in , and took @entity321 for mugs			0
there is only one set of mugs after that sequence of results			0
they need to win the next one , and not just to keep @entity361 ’s big , front - running horses in sight .			2
