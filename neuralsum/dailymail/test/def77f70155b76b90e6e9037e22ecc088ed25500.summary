' we 're very happy to go through but personally i do feel for the goalkeeper			0

@entity2 was inconsolable at the final whistle despite his team - mates and staff trying to help ' they 're very solid defensively , they 're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well			2
' today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper			0
it was a difficult game but we just got over the line			0
' @entity1 are now just one win away from defending the crown they secured last year , with either @entity80 or @entity81 lying in wait in the final			2
@entity0 was also at fault for the @entity4 goal when he let @entity87 's shot find a way into the net @entity90 would also see the @entity91 become the most successful @entity7 team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with @entity96			1
' we want to win for the fans , ' @entity1 midfielder @entity97 added			2
' it 's always special to play at @entity14 and we have a good opportunity to get the title			2
