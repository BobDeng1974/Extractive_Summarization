it will be the focal event of next week 's @entity1			0
but the lighting of the @entity3 is in danger of being overshadowed by the petty squabble between two of @entity8 's greatest olympians about who deserves the honour			2
@entity11 and sir @entity12 have each questioned the other 's credentials to be the one to light the fire to launch @entity17			1
yesterday double - gold winning decathlete @entity11 implied that rowing was much easier than his own specialism of track and field , adding that sir @entity12 was ‘ not in the same class ’ as his friend @entity25			1
who is the greatest ? @entity11 ( left ) said that rower sir @entity12 ( right ) was ' not in the same class ' as his friend @entity25 the pair are said to have always had a lukewarm relationship , so eyebrows were raised when they were both named as favourites to light the cauldron at the opening ceremony			1
it emerged that former runner @entity25 , chairman of organisers @entity35 , had been pushing for his long - time friend @entity11 to do the honours on july 27 , over the bookies ’ favourite sir @entity12			1
yesterday , when asked about any rivalry between @entity25 and sir @entity12 , @entity11 said : ‘ why would there be rivalry ? in my opinion @entity25 is the second greatest olympian , after myself			1
‘ @entity12 is not in the same class as @entity25			2
he is a rower , but i think track and field is the toughest sport in the @entity48 , which means the rewards are greater			2
’ contentious : it emerged that lord @entity25 , chairman of organisers @entity35 , had been pushing for his long - standing friend @entity11 to do the honours at the opening ceremony asked if sir @entity12 was one of the obvious choices to light the torch as a five - times @entity25 , @entity11 said : ‘ i do n’t think so			1
it depends on your opinion			0
who should light the @entity3 flame ? who should light the @entity3 flame ? now share your opinion ‘ without knowing the criteria or who is making the decision , it ’s impossible for me to say who should light the flame			0
’ in an article in the @entity69 newspaper two weeks ago , sir @entity12 wrote : ‘ obviously , @entity11 was a great athlete			2
some people , @entity25 included , think he ’s the best athlete ever			0
' my personal view is that he does n’t make the top five of great @entity8 olympians			0
i ’d put @entity25 above him , and @entity75 , certainly @entity76 , and , all modesty aside , myself and @entity78			0
‘ i say that because , to me , athletes compete at the decathlon if they are great all - rounders instead of being supreme in one event			0
’ rapid rower : sir @entity12 holds his hand aloft in a salute to the @entity8 support at @entity87 after winning his fifth consecutive gold medal @entity25 and @entity11 both won the first of their two @entity3 golds in @entity91 in 1980 – @entity25 in the 1,500 metres and @entity11 in the decathlon			1
they both won gold again four years later in @entity96 , the @entity94 at which sir @entity12 won the first of his five gold medals			0
he went on to win gold in @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 in the @entity104 discipline and @entity87 in the @entity105			0
olympics @entity107 @entity94 olympics @entity107 @entity94 traditionally it has always been track and field athletes to light the cauldron , with a few exceptions			1
but no rower has ever taken the responsibility			0
lord @entity25 has no direct power over who will light the cauldron , but @entity35 chief executive @entity118 is one of the key decision - makers			1
lord @entity25 has previously joked that @entity11 should perform the lighting ‘ because he is my mate ’ , adding : ‘ i also do actually happen to believe he is the greatest olympian we have delivered			1
’ however , this week he said the decision may not be made until the day itself			2
multi-disciplined : @entity11 on his way to gold during the @entity127 in @entity96			0

pair are said to have always *enjoyed* a lukewarm relationship
lord @entity25 had been pushing for his friend @entity11 to do the honours
@entity11 says @entity12 was not the obvious choice to light cauldron
@entity139 's comments come after @entity12 said @entity11 did *n't* even make top five greatest @entity141 list
no rower has ever lit the cauldron , usually track and field athletes
lord @entity25 has said the decision may not be made until the day itself
