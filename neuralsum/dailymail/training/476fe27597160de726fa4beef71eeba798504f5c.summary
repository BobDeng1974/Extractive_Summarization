but though it promised ‘ no need for disappointment or surprise ’ , someone ’s been left thoroughly unamused by the ‘ @entity1 ’ – the singer whose name it borrows			2
now the 1960s ' rock ’ n ’ roll star who ’s famed for the twist has filed a $ 500million lawsuit in the @entity22 against technology firm @entity3 , through whose software the app was available			1
lawyers for the singer – whose real name is @entity1 – claim the app developed by a company called @entity29 , has done ‘ irreparable damage ’ to their client by associating the @entity1 name with ‘ sexual connotation ’			1
they said : ' purchasers of " the @entity1 " app and non-purchasing browsers of the associated web page are being misled into believing that plaintiffs have endorsed defendant 's app. ' the suit adds that the app ‘ tarnishes ’ the stage name which @entity1 trademarked in 1997			1
the application for @entity3 's @entity46 platform boasted : ' any of you ladies out there just start seeing someone new and wondering what the size of their member is ? ' all you need to do is find out the man ’s shoe size and plug it in ... now with the @entity1 there is no need for disappointment or surprise ... ” the house of @entity63 software website shows that the $ 0.99 app was downloaded just 84 times			1
@entity66 , @entity1 's lawyer said : ' we can not sit idly and watch as technology giants or anyone else exploits the name or likeness of an innocent person with the goal of making millions of dollars			2
' @entity1 was born in 1941 in @entity84 , @entity85 , but grew up in @entity86 , where he lived with his parents and two brothers			2
in june of 1959 he recorded a cover of @entity91 's r&b hit ' the twist ' and 14 months later , in the summer of 1960 , it was a sensation			0
the official @entity1 website says : ' the twist ' was not only the # 1 song but it introduced the concept of ' dancing apart to the beat '			0
' over the next few years , endless songs incorporating ' the twist ' into its name sprang up such as ' @entity103 ' , ' @entity99 '			0
' in addition , each new song brought a new dance involving ' dancing apart to the beat ' such as @entity108 , the @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
at the forefront was @entity1 with @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
