the @entity0 's tale : @entity2 and the year that made the canterbury tales by @entity5 perhaps it is because contemporary life is intolerable that people are flocking back to the past			1
they really ca n’t get enough of it , as the obsession with @entity14 and @entity15 politics demonstrates — though in my view , @entity17 and @entity18 are n’t a patch on @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity24 , which covered the same ground as @entity26 and more amusingly , too			0
‘ has she been chaste ? ’ — ‘ all over @entity28 ’ , etc. when at last 16 - century history begins to pall — those lutes and galliards in a @entity33 court ; the @entity36 ’s matrimonial wrangles and the breach with the @entity38 — my bet is we ’ll crank backwards another couple of hundred years and become fascinated with all things medieval			1
the son of a wine merchant , @entity2 grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the @entity46 in anticipation of the next trend , @entity5 has written a pungent book about the ‘ turbulence and change ’ of the @entity52 , when @entity53 and @entity54 were mixing and merging to create the modern @entity56 language and hence the modern @entity56 identity			1
it was a picturesque period — the tournaments and festivities , ‘ jousting and lance - play ’ , the ‘ lavish consumption and frivolous display ’ : @entity64 spent millions on ribbons and taffeta embroidered with jewels			1
the fashion was for extravagant hats and ‘ outlandish coiffures ’ , which make @entity71 look like the @entity72			1
money came from the wool trade , ‘ the nation ’s most important income source ’			1
the poet @entity2 worked as a controller in the wool customs and excise department , his job being to keep the accounts and collect tariffs and duties			1
the son of a wine merchant , @entity2 grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the @entity46			1
he began his career in aristocratic service as ‘ a genteel and versatile kind of errand runner ’ , known as a valet or esquire , before being promoted , as a ‘ literate ’ civil servant , to ‘ the administrative bureaucracy of later @entity92 ’			1
an unpromising background for an artist , you might think			0
but then , @entity99 worked in a bank and @entity101 was a librarian			0
@entity5 ’s contention is that what @entity2 later wrote about in @entity104 was his direct recollection of rollicking @entity107 life — the ‘ socially mixed body of pilgrims ’ telling their stories , the fables , adventures and bawdy romps , were a version of what he saw going on out of his window			1
this is where the book comes into its own , as a description of the @entity123 in the year 1374 , when @entity2 first went up ‘ an awkward circular flight of stone stairs ’ into his apartment in @entity128 — one of the many fortified gatehouses surrounding the capital , when it was encompassed by thick , stone walls			1
it is hard to imagine now , when @entity107 is a big splodge , but 700 years ago , @entity134 was a separate place from @entity107 proper , half - a - mile away along ‘ clogged footpaths ’			1
@entity137 was a remote fishing village			0
@entity138 and @entity139 were in the middle of deep countryside , with flocks of sheep			0
but , in case this starts to sound idyllic , @entity5 reminds us that next to @entity2 ’s @entity128 was the open sewer known as @entity148 , named after the kennels on the bank of the @entity46 maintained for hunting purposes			1
dead dogs were chucked in , along with the odd beggar , and ‘ it stank to high heaven ’			1
also adjacent was the ‘ extensive latrine ’ maintained by @entity157 for the clergy			1
add to this scene the felons ’ and traitors ’ heads rotting on spikes , and you realise a strong stomach was needed to survive in those germ - prone days			2
iron - wheeled carts rattled beneath @entity2 ’s window , as did drovers , water - carriers and wood - sellers , shouting and yelling			1
there were continuous processions of convicts and chanting monks , who belonged to the innumerable religious fraternities			0
meals were eaten at taverns or from stalls in the street , purchased directly from street - side ovens			0
no health and safety regulations back then			0
eating and drinking was supplemented by courtesans from ‘ the stews of @entity188 ’ or ‘ unlicensed brothels ’ of @entity190 plying their trade			2
to such raucousness must be added the tolling and pealing of the parish bells , which began before dawn and ended only with the night curfew			0
many medieval legal cases involved trespass , disputes over boundaries and incursions on personal living space			0
this reflects the congestion of @entity107 — the populace fighting for a little privacy beyond the teeming and insanitary 12 ft - wide streets			2
with privacy difficult to obtain ( few could afford secluded chambers or an enclosed garden ) , sex could be a bit of a free - for - all , especially after dark when lanterns were extinguished			0
‘ @entity220 incidents , ’ says @entity5 , ‘ were part of the fodder of daily life			1
’ @entity2 was always writing about bottoms being thrust out of windows , ladders conveniently being left next to open casements in readiness for a tryst , rumbles behind the arras , undone breeches around the ankles and so forth			1
@entity230 by temperament , he saw no difference between ‘ a cheating wife of high degree			0
and a poor woman who engaged in the same conduct ’			0
oh , whatever happened to wenches ? i used to love a good wench , me			0
@entity241 and @entity242 were wenches			0
@entity2 described a typical damsel approvingly as frike , or frisky			2
he himself did n’t have much luck with the ladies , frike or otherwise			0
his wife , @entity247 , lived apart from him in @entity248 , where she was a lady - in - waiting to @entity64 ’s 13 - year - old queen			0
possibly owing to the enforced separation , @entity2 in his poems does dwell on the ‘ mistakes , misapprehensions and woes ’ of the marital state			1
the @entity257 , for example , has had numerous husbands — and she ’s an archetypal wench			0
she has a little gap between her top teeth , which was considered saucy			0
in 1386 , at the age of 43 , @entity2 was sacked , along with the other controllers who ’d had their hands in the till			2
he left for @entity267 — @entity268 , @entity269 and , of course , @entity271 — and he set down his classic saga , the ‘ cacophony of competing speakers ’ , knights , yeomen , nuns , merchants , confidence tricksters			2
before the printing press , readers were of necessity ‘ few and private rather than numerous and far - flung ’			2
the manuscript fragments were assembled only after @entity2 ’s death ( in 1400 ) , copied and recopied by professional scribes ( 55 manuscripts exist ) and finally typeset in 1473 , when paper superseded parchment			2
@entity2 was the first writer in vernacular @entity56 , rather than in @entity53			2
it ’s not hard to follow — for example , say ‘ nat worth a toord ’ aloud and the meaning is plain			2
as @entity5 says , ‘ human emotions and objectives remain recognisable across time ’ and , when @entity104 was filmed by @entity301 in 1972 , it starred @entity295 of @entity297 fame			1
he knew plenty about shooting up ladders , absent hubbies and the bums of wenches sticking out of windows and wardrobes .			0
