it promises to replace all your credit cards with a single slim , digital card			1
@entity5 firm @entity4 first took the internet by storm last year when it revealed the $ 100 card			1
now , it is set to let the first customers test the gadget that could take over your pocket			0
however the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use			2
debit cards , credit cards , gift cards , loyalty cards and membership cards can all be loaded			2
an app is used to program the information of up to eight cards securely in the device			1
the buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button			2
' @entity4 works with your debit cards , credit cards , gift cards , loyalty cards and membership cards , ' the firm boasts			1
' instead of carrying several cards you carry one @entity4			1
' the coin card is that is uses a magnetic strip like any regular credit or debit card			1
however the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use			0
an app is used to program the information of up to eight cards securely in the device			1
the buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button			2
to make the card foolproof , the company said this week it will expand its beta program to 10,000 people			0
compact : the @entity4 car is sleek and small by a regular credit card but it can hold the information of up to eight others including debit cards , gift cards , loyalty cards and membership cards ' this is designed for the lifestyle of today with the technology of tomorrow , ” says @entity87 , founder of @entity4			1
' you do n’t need eight cards every day , so your phone is kind of like your drawer , and your @entity4 is kind of like your wallet			1
' users then take photos of their cards , swipe them through the dongle and upload them to the @entity4 mobile app , which stores the info onto your coin card			1
when you want to pay , you browse through stored cards on your @entity4 , select one , and swipe it anywhere credit , debit or gift cards are accepted			1
information is loaded onto the card through a mobile app , which the firm launched last month			0
the process of adding card information to the mobile app is very simple and is done by taking a picture or two and swiping credit cards through a dongle attached to your phone			2
however critics have claimed the device is nothing to get too excited about			0
as countries slowly move towards the more secure @entity120 credit card system , the @entity4 device is likely to become obsolete			1
mobile payments remain an elusive area with a number of banks and card suppliers attempting to come up with a convenient , safe and secure solution			0
convenient : the coin card is approximately the size of a single credit card that can store all your swipe - able cards and be used to pay everywhere cards are accepted , all in real time in order to make a payment with this card , users tap a button on the coin card and pick which account they want to pay with , whether it 's a business credit card or a personal debit card			1
after picking an account , the coin card is swiped through , no different than any other card			0
both tech large and small have attempted to crack the mobile payments sector and any firm able to facilitate person - to - person or person - to - business transitions on a mass scale stands to gain significant profit off such payments			0
@entity150 , a blogger with @entity151 , is n't convinced the technology will takeoff			0
' to me , the only real problem with @entity4 is that it feels like a stopgap technology , like those cd - changer cartridges that were popular for a little while before everyone switched to mp3s			2
replacing eight cards with one may lighten your load by an ounce or two , but is that enough to convince people to take the leap of faith involved in adopting a new payment system ? even early adopters could be forgiven for holding out for a more comprehensive digital wallet — the kind that will let you pay for everything just by tapping your phone , or perhaps some other , even more seamless gesture			1
' other critics have said the card is not forward - thinking or future - proof whatsoever			0
one claimed it was nothing more than ' old technology wrapped up in a posh case			0
' ' this is not at all useful overseas where @entity181 , @entity182 and most of @entity183 use @entity120			0
in fact , it 's typical @entity188 thinking whereby the developers have only thought of themselves and not of the winder consequences of usefulness of the @entity192 your $ 100 if i were you ! ' how it works : your credit cards and loaded onto the @entity4 app by swiping them in and taking a photo			1
the coin card can then be used like a normal credit card smart card : the coin card uses a @entity205 emitter which means if the card is left behind for any reason the card will no longer function the battery in @entity4 , said to last up to two years , powers a small display screen that shows which saved card will be charged , along with its expiration date			2
cards are entered into @entity4 after being swiped on a square - like dongle plugged into a smartphone			1
there are also few worries about leaving the card behind somewhere or losing it altogether			0
the coin card only operates if your smartphone is nearby by using the bluetooth signals			0
if the card is disconnected for more than ten minutes , the phone will alert the customer that they have left their card behind			0
if the owner drifts too far from @entity4 , his or her smartphone will alert them			2
if the card is disconnected for more than 10 minutes , it automatically disables itself , which could potentially be an issue if a phone runs out of juice .			0
