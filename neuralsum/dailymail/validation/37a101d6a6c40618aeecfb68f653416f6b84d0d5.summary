his voice hoarse and shaking with emotion , he said : ' i knew i was getting hacked by the @entity9			1

@entity0 said that he blamed his family for what he thought were leaks and did not speak to them for almost two years - refusing to go for @entity103 with them - because he thought they had betrayed him			1
' it is very sad to me that a lot of damage has already been done to my family that can not easily be fixed			0
my apologising to them now can not turn back the clock for things i have said to them , and the hurt that this has caused			0

i felt that i was being watched or listened into all the time for years and the pressure on me because of that was more than i think any sane person could bear			0
' details of eight representative phone hacking cases are being heard at the @entity186 he said that , while he was at @entity134 in october 2000 , he felt as if his life was falling apart and went to stay at the @entity189 as he needed to get help quickly			2
' the main reason why i had to go to get help at the @entity122 on this occasion was the constant pressure from the media , including articles and threats of articles being published by journalists			0

i felt very paranoid at that time about being pursued by the media			0
