now however , he says he will never be able to have a relationship with a woman again after the surgery reduced his penis to an inch long			1
' i know the majority of people are probably expecting me to express extreme happiness and glee that my life has been transformed since the sac has been removed - but it ’s not as simple as that , ' he told @entity43 ' i ’m grateful to have been pulled out of the fire , i was getting burned , but now i ’m dealing with the first degree burns			1

' it was just horrible			0
i could n’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then i fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and lift me up			0
he was so desperate to have the life - changing surgery that he considered auctioning off the sac online after it had been removed			1
he explained to his surgegion , dr @entity79 that he wanted to retain the giant scrotum to pay for his hospital bill , but fortunately dr @entity79 agreed to carry out the operation for free , which has been documented in a @entity83 on @entity84 , to be shown on monday			2
' there are a lot of shows about makeovers , but this is a real makeover , ' dr. @entity79 , who heads the @entity86 at the @entity87 , said of the procedure			0

' for sale : mr @entity10 initially considered selling his scrotum on @entity13 in order to pay for surgery on april 8 , dr @entity79 and three other physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective sac of skin and muscles that contained @entity10 's testicles and penis , according to the @entity63			1
the mass caused by the condition , known as scrotal lymphedema , had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years			0
mr @entity10 , who has blood pressure problems and asthma , had previously spoken of his fear of dying during surgery			1
the watermelon - size scrotum mr @entity10 carried between his legs landed him on the @entity112 and @entity113 and made him a local celebrity in his hometown			1

basking in fame : mr @entity10 's unusual handicap led to him becoming a local celebrity fear : @entity10 was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong his penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to urinate on himself and said only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman			1
' i do n't like being a freak , who would ? ' he told the @entity63			0
the massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum			0
doctors had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his scrotum			0
there was also a chance that complications could force the surgeons to cut off his genitals if his scrotum did n't stop bleeding			0
' i still have n't lost a patient or a testicle ( in patients with problems similar to @entity10 's ) , ' dr @entity79 told the @entity63			2
the extremely rare condition is much more common in @entity155 and @entity156 , where it is caused by parasites , than it is in the western world			0
mr @entity10 says he contracted it somehow when he hit his testicle with his own leg while turning in bed one morning but dr @entity79 said he ' had no idea ' how the man contracted it			2
