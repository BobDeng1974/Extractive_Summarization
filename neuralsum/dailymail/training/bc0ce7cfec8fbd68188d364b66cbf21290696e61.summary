by @entity0 @entity2 's homecoming did n't go to script for the @entity6 @entity5 star as @entity7 were beaten by @entity8 at @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity12 's side got more than they bargained for against the team which finish one place above the wooden spoon last @entity17 season and for @entity2 , who was handed the captain 's armband for the occasion , it 'll be a night to forget			1
the @entity8 took a 2 - 0 lead into half - time and @entity7 were only able to peg one back through new signing @entity23 inside the closing 20 minutes			2
shining light : @entity23 's goal was a rare positive sign for @entity12 as @entity7 lost to @entity29 upset : @entity29 's @entity30 ( right ) celebrates with team - mates after he heads them into the lead hometown hero : @entity6 's @entity2 was given the captain 's armband for the match in @entity10 @entity8 : @entity37 ( @entity38 81 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 90 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 78 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 71 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 55 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 84 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity30 ( c ) , @entity49 subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 goals : @entity30 , @entity40 @entity7 : @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 68 ) , @entity2 ( c ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 68 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 78 ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 60 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 71 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 84 ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 81 ) , @entity75 ( @entity76 71 ) , @entity77 ( @entity78 60 ) subs not used : @entity80 , @entity81 goal : @entity23 it took a slice of individual brilliance from @entity23 , making his second appearance for the @entity7 after a 33 - minute shift in their 0 - 0 friendly against @entity89 , to give his side a chance to save face			1
a slick side - step at the top of the penalty area and a powerful finish into the bottom left corner from the @entity98 gave keeper @entity37 no chance			2
but the celebrations were muted from the tourists who knew this was rare show of class when the expectations were much higher from both their manager and the crowd			0
@entity8 took the lead after just 11 minutes after @entity69 was beaten for pace and gifted the @entity109 a free - kick , which @entity111 - born @entity6 international @entity30 headed home			1
@entity40 made it 2 - 0 with a solo run that left the @entity7 ' defence reeling and a solid finish past @entity60 - it was a magic moment for the 20 - year - old who joined @entity118 as a 16 - year - old from @entity120 , in @entity121 , but was let go on a free transfer this season having not graduated from the academy system			1
chances to extend the lead kept coming for the hosts in the second half , including @entity42 ' curling effort that stretched @entity60 and added insult to injury for @entity7 's opening hour			2
going in hard : @entity48 shows the @entity132 mean business in this tackle on @entity78 ( left ) tradition : @entity8 fans take their shirts off with 10 minutes to go , as is their custom if in the lead all together : @entity8 and @entity7 players join for a photo to mark the rare appearance of a @entity5 team in @entity6 ups and downs : @entity2 miscues a challenge while @entity67 appeals to the referee close attention : @entity147 is given no room to move by @entity48 both ends : goalscorer and @entity151 goes in for a trademark tough challenge on @entity69 @entity12 wo n't have been impressed , especially given @entity8 took the field minus three of their most important players from their last - albeit unsuccessful - campaign			1
@entity157 rained onto @entity9 in the closing stages , as is customary in friendlies , with @entity70 making his debut after his free move from @entity162			0
another custom that wo n't have amused the @entity7 came from the @entity8 fans , who traditionally take their tops off if their team is leading going into the final 10 minutes of a match			0
@entity78 , who came on late , went close to an equaliser in the closing stages but was denied by @entity170 , who made his club debut after a move from @entity173 when he replaced @entity37			0
before the match , a traditional @entity174 issued a challenge to the @entity7 they could n't meet			0
both sides also paid tribute to @entity180 fans @entity181 and @entity182 , and those who were lost in the @entity185 tragedy over the @entity186 .			0

@entity30 and @entity40 scored first - half goals for the hosts
@entity191 scored in the 71st minute for the @entity5 side
@entity2 was made captain for the match in @entity10 , the city of his birth
