the dates were engraved a few weeks ago oops : his birth year is wrong , shaving 18 years off his age when he died earlier the year the flub is particularly embarrassing considering his ' new ' birth date would have made @entity3 a child in @entity28 , and the same headstone says he served in the armed forces during that time			1

on the tombstone , @entity3 included the words of journalist @entity90 , who was killed by @entity93 terrorists : ' my father is @entity96 ; my mother is @entity96 ; i am @entity96			2
