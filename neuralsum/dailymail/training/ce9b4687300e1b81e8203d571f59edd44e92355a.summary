what 's the worst part of your job ? long hours ? rubbish pay ? crazy bosses ? well spare a thought for poor model / designer / dj @entity7 , who claims that free champagne is just the worst thing about working in fashion			1
the 31 - year - old fashionista was quizzed by @entity14 on the perils of working in the world 's most glamorous industry and rather than take the opportunity to talk about body image or the plight of underpaid factory workers , the brunette singled out the posh fizz given out at parties as her biggest gripe			1
' do you know what ? i really hate champagne , ' she says in a video short for the publication			2
' and my least favourite part of fashion is that that 's the thing that they love to give out free at everything			0
' and in the past single @entity42 has said that @entity58 bourbon and @entity59 on the rocks ' as strong as you can make it ' is her favourite tipple			2
not again : the presenter is often expected to sup free champagne at events and parties when asked to describe the style industry the @entity66 writer , who introduces herself as a girl who ' stands in parties in outfits ' for a living , tells @entity14 that it is ridiculous : ' the fashion industry is just like zoolander if @entity73 was a documentary , ' she says			1
but for youngsters still wanting to make it in the ultra-competitive world of fashion she offers some sage advice : ' find your voice and have a unique perspective on things			1
have a clear vision that 's new and fresh			0
' or failing that , she says , be so ' slamming hot ' that you just get to be there			0
works for some ... @entity92 babe : @entity42 prefers a more manly drink like @entity95 's @entity94 and @entity59 on the rocks			0

presenter and model was interviewed for @entity14
reveals that she hates the association between fashion and champagne
@entity106 prefers a tot of whisky , particularly @entity58 , on night out
advises *wannabe* fashionistas to ' have a unique perspective on things '
