by @entity0 , science reporter published : 13:49 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 24 june 2013 progress : the research marks a step towards producing more effective treatment for migraine sufferers			1
around 40 per cent of patients do not respond to available medication hopes of a migraine cure have been boosted by the discovery of genes linked to the crippling headaches			1
in the largest study ever to look at migraines , researchers have identified five more sections of our dna associated with their onset			1
they have also confirmed the importance of seven more of these ‘ genetic regions ’ which have previously been linked to migraines			1
most of them contain genes responsible for controlling brain circuitry or maintaining healthy brain tissue , while some are also linked to healthy circulation and cardiovascular disease			0
scientists say the research , which looked at more than 100,000 genetic samples , offers a fresh understanding of what triggers migraines			2
the team uncovered the genetic regions linked to the illness by comparing the results from 29 health studies , which involved dna samples from both migraine patients and healthy individuals			2
some of the regions identified were found to be close to a network of genes that are sensitive to an imbalance of oxygen			0
the researchers suggest these susceptible genetic regions are interconnected and could be disrupting the internal regulation of the brain , resulting in migraine symptoms			2
by the end of next year , the team hopes to map more than half of the genes linked to the condition			0
medication is available to alleviate the intense headaches , which can be accompanied by nausea and an acute sensitivity to light			1
but around 40 per cent of patients do not respond , while 15 per cent develop chronic migraines			0
it is hoped the research could lead to new treatments becoming available in the next few years			0
lead author dr @entity71 , whose study is published in the journal @entity74 , said : ‘ this study has greatly advanced our biological insight about the cause of migraine			0
study : the team uncovered the areas linked to the illness by comparing dna samples from both migraine patients and healthy individuals ‘ migraine and epilepsy are particularly difficult neural conditions to study ; between episodes the patient is basically healthy so it ’s extremely difficult to uncover biochemical clues			1
’ dr @entity71 , from the @entity94 , which is based in @entity95 , said : ‘ we are narrowing down the areas that cause migraines			0
‘ in the future , we will be able to look at an individual ’s dna profile and target them with a more personalised , tailored treatment , rather than a fix all			0
’ thought to affect one in every seven adults , migraines have been recognised by the @entity108 as one of the top 20 most disabling lifetime conditions and cost the @entity112 economy an estimated £ 2billion a year .			1

intense headaches *notoriously* difficult to treat and can last for days
@entity108 name migraines in top 20 most disabling lifetime conditions
one in seven adults suffer form migraine which costs the @entity120 £ *2bn* a year
