by @entity0 in the months after @entity3 forces invaded @entity4 in 2003 , @entity1 would look warily as soldiers carrying heavy weapons patrolled his neighborhood in @entity8			1
normally , he would keep his distance			0
but one afternoon he approached some @entity3 troops stopped on a street after seeing them having a tough time communicating with an @entity4 man			1
the man had been trying to tell the @entity3 about detainees in a presidential palace who were trapped			2
the man , an engineer , had built the palace			0
translator turned soldier @entity22 pictured in 2008 when he was working for @entity23 at @entity24 ' that staff sergeant just goes nuts about it , ' @entity1 said			1
' and , he ( the @entity4 ) is yelling at him , ' you need to come with me right now ! ' @entity1 , 25 at the time , had learned @entity30 growing up around the world and stepped in to help translate			1
a few minutes later , he started to walk away and a sergeant asked him to wait			0
the soldiers needed a translator to replace a @entity35 who was returning home			0
would he be interested ? unemployed at the time , translating seemed like an adventure , a chance for @entity1 to see parts of @entity4 he had never visited			1
he agreed and that encounter set him on an improbable course that has brought him full circle with the invading @entity3 forces who many @entity4 still blame for the ills plaguing the country : he is now a lieutenant in the @entity50 at @entity51			1
born in @entity4 , @entity1 grew up internationally as the son of an @entity4 diplomat whose assignments took him to @entity55 ; @entity56 , where he learned @entity30 ; @entity57 ; and @entity58			1
@entity1 and his family returned to @entity4 in 1990 , around the time president @entity60 was invading neighboring @entity35			1
a @entity3 contracted interpreter ( not @entity1 ) speaks with an @entity4 woman after graduating from high school in @entity4 , @entity1 earned a bachelor 's degree and then a master 's in @entity30 literature from the @entity67 , where he relished digging into the works of @entity3 literary greats like playwright @entity70			1
like for all @entity4 , the @entity3 - led invasion upended daily life for @entity1 's family			1
overnight , @entity3 soldiers were patrolling major cities , and @entity1 kept his distance — until the day he stepped in to translate			1
at first , @entity1 had mixed feelings about helping @entity3 soldiers			1
as @entity79 , his family had been oppressed for years by the minority ruling @entity81 and @entity60 — some of his father 's cousins were killed during the failed 1991 @entity79 uprising — so anything to help topple that system seemed worthwhile			0
still , like many @entity4 , he had grown up hearing propaganda about the evils of @entity3			1
a month after he began translating for @entity3 troops , @entity1 started working with the @entity91 , 187th infantry , a @entity51 - based unit known as the ' @entity93 ' — a term the unit ironically got from a @entity97 translator after @entity98 who could n't immediately come up with the word for airborne unit so used called them ' rakkasan , ' or ' falling down umbrella men			1
' over the course of three months , @entity103 interpreted as troops moved north from @entity105 to @entity106 and @entity107			0
it was the adventure the man was hoping for when he first signed up , and the @entity4 native brought an expertise to the job that few others would have had			1
while working with an intelligence division in @entity116 , west of @entity107 , @entity1 's family background came into play			1
when @entity1 ( not pictured ) worked as a translator he would assist @entity3 soldiers in translating and also in judging character the area was filled with @entity79 @entity123 who refused to speak to any of the @entity126 interpreters the @entity50 had been using — a remnant of the long - standing animosity between @entity129 and @entity130 in northern @entity4			1
@entity1 noticed a picture of a @entity79 saint hanging in the house of a village elder			2
' i said ' you 're @entity123 , right ? @entity137 ? ' @entity1 asked			2
' and as soon as i told them i was from @entity8 , my parents were from @entity8 , they just loved me			0
' working north of @entity105 , @entity1 followed the soldiers into several towns and villages that backed @entity60 's @entity143			1
back at the battalion base , @entity1 would always lay out for intelligence officers his impressions of people he interviewed while on a mission			2
' this guy 's faking it			0
this guy 's hiding something , ' @entity1 recalled telling an officer			2
' i 'm just giving him my gut feeling			0
' as the military moved north , @entity1 hoped to go to the @entity157 near the @entity129 border — a place he had never been			2
however , the @entity50 had other plans and headed west instead , and he never made it to @entity157			0
ready for something new , @entity1 took a job with @entity164 , where he was ' the street guy			1
' ' i 'd roam the streets of @entity105 , go into the provinces , talk to the people			0
i went to rural places that nobody had ever heard of , places nobody would ever cover , ' @entity1 said			2
one day , the horrors of war hit home			0
@entity1 's father was kidnapped			2
four men put pistols to the heads of @entity178 and another family member and forced them from the car			0
the men switched @entity178 to another car and fled			0
later , they called @entity1 's family asking for ransom			2
@entity1 feared his father would be killed regardless of any ransom , but they had to try to save him			2
' i do n't want to live with the idea of him knowing we were n't going to pay the ransom , ' @entity1 recalled telling himself			0
' i do n't want him to die knowing his family abandoned him and were not willing to pay $ 20,000 , $ 30,000 or $ 40,000			0
' the family scraped together the cash from savings and @entity1 's earnings			2
@entity1 declined to disclose how much the family put forward , but his employer at the time , @entity164 , put up $ 10,000 toward the ransom			1
the kidnappers guided @entity1 by phone around @entity105 for about 45 minutes before he dropped the money at a dictated location			0
he never saw @entity204 again			0
' i waited and waited and waited for nothing , ' @entity1 said			0
now @entity1 ( not pictured ) wears a @entity3 uniform while still maintaining a love for his home country of @entity4 @entity1 took to searching for his father in the morgues			1
' every time i 'd go there , it was like hell , ' @entity1 said			2
soon after his father disappeared , a translator @entity1 knew was killed by insurgents , and @entity1 worried he could be next			2
the family decided to leave @entity4			2
@entity1 applied for a student visa and got into @entity221 and arrived in early 2007 with his wife and two young children			1
while completing a master 's degree in journalism and working for @entity23 at @entity24 , @entity1 sometimes thought back with nostalgia on his time translating for the @entity50			1
he had enjoyed the camaraderie , adventure and sense of purpose			0
in 2010 , he signed up			0
after bouncing around several military posts , including @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity1 began working in intelligence for the ' rakkasans			1
' @entity1 saw familiar faces after being transferred to @entity51			0
many recognized him , as well			0
seeing @entity1 in uniform was ' fairly surreal , ' said lt. col. @entity241 , who was with the @entity242 based at @entity51 , @entity243 , during the initial invasion of @entity4			1
' i knew that i knew who he was , but it took a minute			0
' @entity1 , who remains an @entity4 citizen , today looks and acts every inch the soldier , and like many soldiers , he does n't betray much			1
not even about the profound decision to sign on with the invading @entity50 he once eyed warily			0
one of the few times he softens is when he concedes he worries about relatives in @entity4			0
the country is mired in near - daily violence , and many @entity4 blame the @entity3 military and president @entity257 for the invasion that allowed ethnic tensions to come to the fore			1
still , @entity1 says family back home support his career path , and that someday he may return to help his homeland , much the way he has helped @entity3			1
' my family is still there , ' he said			0
' it is still where i 'm from			0

@entity1 , 25 at the time , knew @entity30 and stepped in to help translate one day when @entity3 soldiers were having trouble communicating
a month after he began translating for @entity3 troops , @entity1 started working with the @entity91 , 187th infantry
@entity1 went to work for @entity164 , to study at @entity221 and also worked for @entity23 at @entity24
in 2010 , @entity1 signed up to be a @entity3 soldier
' my family is still there , ' he spoke of @entity4 . ' it is still where i 'm from '
