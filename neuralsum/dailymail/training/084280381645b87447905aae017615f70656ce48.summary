by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 03:15 est , 14 january 2014 an elderly lady 's hopeful campaign to bring out the best in a deprived road in @entity6 , dubbed @entity7 , ends in failure after a lacklustre effort from neighbours and even threats of violence			1
despite the enthusiasm of a local , known only as @entity15 , who enters notorious @entity7 , @entity6 , into the @entity16 in @entity18 competition , the community fails to impress the judges in an episode of the @entity22 documentary to be broadcast this evening			1
ahead of the competition , @entity15 told the cameras : ' i moved in 20 years ago , and older people said there was a queue to get into these houses			1
that is what it could be again			0
' and some residents made the effort to recapture the old days ahead of the judges ' arrival			2
one , called @entity58 , decking her paved front garden in hanging baskets			0
but other elements were less able to draw the judges ' praise , including @entity65 , 42 , who declined to install any flowers , or her companion ' @entity68 ' , who wondered aloud why @entity15 was bothering			1
and , although the judges were not around to see it , immediately after @entity15 had shown them around the street the camera crews were confronted by two angry men			1
in bloom : some residents made an effort - but others were filmed asking why @entity15 was bothering any interest ? @entity15 goes door to door with information about the competition attempts : in one scene , the pensioner can be seen walking the street with a selection of greenery opposition : ' @entity88 ' declined to participate in the @entity16 in @entity18 competition waving a hammer , one of them made threatening remarks to the people filming the documentary , and had to be placated by other residents			1
in a ceremony shown at the end of the programme , it was revealed that @entity7 had come eighth in the local round of the competition			2
the residents , however , seemed pleased with the achievement and celebrated in a ceremony at the village hall			2
@entity15 made clear that she would maintain her aspirations for the road - which she said was once extremely desirable - by entering it again next year , despite the difficulties caused by many of the residents moving to other properties so often			1
inspection : the judges , and @entity15 , walk around the area and observe resident 's rather lackluster efforts certificate : the group came eighth in the competition however , this too was blighted by accusations that @entity120 , @entity88 's six - year - old son , had bitten another child			1
his mother forcefully denied that it could of happen - admitting that while ' he may not be perfect ' , ' only animals bite '			0
the show tonight airs in the midst of huge opposition from politicians , who have attacked the programme as a ' misrepresentation ' of those on benefits			0
producers have also been accused by those who feature in the show of doing ' anything they could ' for outrageous footage , including bribing residents with alcohol and fast food			2
state : one resident stands in front of a large pile of rubbish left on the pavement controversial : the show has attracted negative remarks about how those featured are portrayed police : some scenes in the series have led to police involvement but producer @entity155 yesterday said he was ' very proud ' of the show , which he called ' a documentary series of the highest order			0
' in comments to the @entity160 , he said : ' all right , we followed someone when the went on a shoplifting spree - i do n't think we need to apologise for that			0
' ' it 's incredibly sympathetic and an honest take on what happened on that street when we were filming			0
' rubbish : some parts of the street were shown to be covered in litter during the show this evening			0

@entity177 , known as @entity15 , has lived near @entity7 for 20 years
she tries to enthuse residents to clean and plant flowers for competition
but the road only receives 8th place when they enter
and after judges leave , thugs *intimidate* camera crew with *weapons*
