@entity0 , ceo for @entity1 , is calling for abortion pill @entity2 to be made legal in the @entity4 an expert in family planning says the @entity4 still have a ' cowboy mentality ' because medical termination pill @entity2 is still illegal in the state			1
@entity0 , ceo for @entity1 , wants the pill to be legalised in the region so women do n't have to wait until they are at least seven weeks pregnant for a surgical procedure where they will be put under anaesthetic			1
the @entity1 is the only state in @entity17 that has not made the pills legal under the @entity19			1
@entity1 say they have been campaigning the government for 12 months and seen no movement in their agenda			1
ms @entity0 told @entity25 : ' our goal is to educate the health services and it 's just so unfair that women in the @entity1 do n't have the same rights as those everywhere else in @entity17			1
' ' half the women who come into our clinics want the medical termination and we can not offer it to them , it 's a crime			0
' it 's just beyond me why this has not been reviewed , it 's shocking , the government is working from a law that is 40 years old , so much has changed and modernised since then			0
' the issue does n't really come to anyone 's attention unless you need that service yourself			0
' the medical termination is less invasive and women do n't have to wait weeks for an outcome			0
' once a woman has made the decision that she wants to have a termination she wants it done as quickly as possible and does n't want to have to wait weeks , it 's very disappointing for them			0
' this law has needed to be changed for years			0
it is unfair for health staff having to work under a law that is so old			2
medical abortion pill @entity2 remains illegal in the @entity4 under the @entity19 surgical termination is legal in the @entity1 but it can only be performed in a hospital by a gynaecologist , campaigners also want this word removed from legislation so more medical professionals can perform the procedure			1
ms @entity0 told @entity25 that there is just one doctor in @entity69 who flies to the region from @entity71 each week to perform the surgical procedures			2
' this is because we do n't have enough doctors who are willing to perform it			0
the gynaecologists decide if they want to do them or not			0
' there are no other doctors in the @entity1 that are within the public health system that want to perform the terminations , there are a couple of doctors in the private sector who will do them but some women up here just can not afford that			2
' some women are resorting to buying the drug off the internet and taking it unsupervised at home without medical attention , ms @entity0 explained			2
she said : ' women can buy this off the shelf in @entity101 and i have heard of cases where they are either getting it off the internet or family members have posted the drug up from other states in @entity17			1
ms @entity0 said : ' women can buy this off the shelf in @entity101 , we need to have it in the @entity1 ' ' when a woman is desperate she will do anything			1
i have also heard of women travelling interstate to have a medical abortion in @entity17 or @entity119			1
' we have backpackers come to us when they have got pregnant and they ca n't believe we do n't offer the pills , they think we are joking			0
' half the population of the @entity1 are women and we should have the same choices and rights as the women across the country			0
' ms @entity0 said she believed the @entity1 government had a ' flippant attitude ' towards the drug and think it is an easy way out for a woman who is pregnant			2
last year nt health minister @entity134 told the @entity135 that the @entity136 had not discussed the legalisation of the drug properly and they were a ' long way off making a final decision '			1
a spokesman for ms @entity134 told @entity25 ' she has said before she is looking into it but there is no new statement coming out on it at the moment ' .			0
