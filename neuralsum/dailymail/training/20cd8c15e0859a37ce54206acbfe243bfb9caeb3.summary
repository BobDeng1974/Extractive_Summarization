@entity2 troops are being sent to @entity3 to help the country defend itself against @entity5 , @entity0 announced today			1
about 75 soldiers will be deployed to carry out tactical intelligence and some basic ' defensive ' infantry training			1
the revelation came as the prime minister warned there would be ' dreadful ' consequences to appeasing @entity13			2
in a clear reference to the @entity15 , mr @entity0 said @entity2 had ' made these mistakes ' before , adding : ' it 's not a sensible thing to do			1
' mr @entity0 said the @entity5 president 's goal was to swallow up swathes of territory on its border			1
he told @entity23 that if @entity2 and the @entity24 did not stand up to @entity5 now , mr @entity13 would target other countries after annexing parts of @entity3			1
about 75 @entity2 soldiers will be sent to @entity3 to carry out tactical intelligence and some basic ' defensive ' infantry training , the @entity10 said today mr @entity0 confirmed the @entity2 military personnel being sent to @entity3 will be deployed over the next few weeks			1
giving evidence to the @entity31 , mr @entity0 said : ' we are not at the stage of supplying lethal equipment			1
we have announced a whole series of non-lethal equipment , night - vision goggles , body armour , which we have already said that we will give to @entity3			2
' over the course of the next month we are going to be deploying @entity2 service personnel to provide advice and a range of training , from tactical intelligence to logistics to medical care , which is something else they have asked for			1
' we will also be developing an infantry training programme with @entity3 to improve the durability of their forces			1
this will involve a number of @entity2 service personnel , they will be away from the area of conflict but i think this is the sort of thing we should be helping with			2
' the prime minister said he was not advocating sending ' large numbers of @entity2 troops ' to @entity3			1
but he said the @entity63 and @entity64 should use its economic might to punish mr @entity13			2
mr @entity0 said : ' of course there is short - term pain when you are putting sanctions on a country there 's short term pain to your own economies			1
' but in the medium to long term the countries of @entity76 depend on a rules - based system where people obey the rules			2
' the instability we will yield if we do n't stand up to @entity5 in the long - term will be deeply damaging to all of us , because you will see further destabilisation – next it will be @entity88 or one of the @entity89			1
' that sort of instability and uncertainty will be dreadful for our economies , dreadful for our stability – and that 's why @entity2 takes such a clear view			1
' mr @entity0 said the @entity5 president @entity13 's goal to swallow up swathes of territory was becoming increasingly clear pro-russian @entity102 residents receive a free meal during a rally as people celebrate the @entity5 festival ' @entity106 ' in @entity102 , @entity3 , yesterday he said mr @entity13 's ' strategic goals ' were becoming clear			1
' we 've now seen a very clear pattern of behaviour			0
we saw it @entity112 , with the creation of @entity114 and @entity115 , we 've seen it with @entity117 – we 're now seeing it with @entity3			2
' he would like if countries respond weekly to try to restore some of the @entity5 near abroad to @entity5			2
that is what he would like to do in my view			0
these countries are democracies and should be able to decide their future			0
' mr @entity0 said allowing @entity5 to swallow up its smaller neighbours with @entity5 - speaking minorities would be wrong			1
he said : ' we 've made these mistakes in our history , or talking about far - away countries of which we know little – and it 's not a sensible thing to do			0
' i 'm not saying we should send huge numbers of @entity2 troops to @entity3 or even that we 're at the stage of arming the @entity3 – but what we should do is make the weight of our economic power that @entity76 and @entity64 play against @entity5 if they continue to behave in this way			1
' @entity13 knows if he continues down this path he will have a very different relationship with @entity76 , with @entity2 , with the @entity64 , with the @entity24			1
' @entity3 's president @entity148 has asked for military help to defeat @entity5 's military advance , @entity0 said today members of the @entity3 armed forces ride an armoured personnel carrier in @entity154 , eastern @entity3 , today mr @entity0 also insisted that @entity5 's annexation of @entity156 and supporting @entity3 rebels had not been a success for @entity159			1
he said : ' let us not talk ourselves into some idea that it 's all been a fantastic success for @entity5 – it has n't been			2
' a couple of @entity5 planes fly around the @entity166			2
but we should n't talk ourselves into a situation where we think we ca n't defend ourselves – we absolutely can			0
the prime minister also insisted that @entity5 knew @entity2 and other members of @entity170 were ' rock solid ' in support of its eastern @entity76 members			1
he said : ' president @entity13 absolutely knows that we would stand by our article five obligations			0
if a country of @entity170 is attacked , an attack on one is an attack on all			0
that is @entity170 doctrine – i sign up to it absolutely			0
' mr @entity0 said @entity2 was keeping up the pressure on mr @entity13 from within the @entity63			1
he said : ' @entity2 's role is to be at the tougher end of the spectrum , keeping the @entity63 and the @entity63 together			2
' by @entity187 @entity13 attended a wreath - laying ceremony to mark the ' @entity190 's defender ' in @entity159 yesterday ministers have been accused of kowtowing to @entity5 by refusing to publicly identify @entity193 ‘ henchmen ’ with links to the @entity2			1
despite a series of provocative acts by the @entity5 – including buzzing bear bomber jets off the coast of @entity200 last week – the @entity195 said it did not want to upset ‘ international relations ’			0
the decision provoked fury among mps and campaigners who accused the government of being on bended knee to the @entity5 lobby of ‘ murderers and torturers ’			2
senior mps say that , where a decision is taken to ban @entity5 officials from travelling to the @entity2 on the grounds their presence here would be harmful , they should be publicly identified			1
this is considered crucial as , by omission , it would also reveal which of the president ’s wealthy associates – including men with links to a notorious murders and the mafia – have not been excluded			0
there are fears a string of @entity5 who may even pose a threat to national security are still being allowed in , to avoid angering @entity13			1
@entity235 @entity234 warned : ‘ if we are serious about trying to alter @entity13 ’s behaviour , should we not start by making sure that those who bankroll him can not enjoy the fruits of their labour here , clandestinely in luxurious comfort ? ‘ those individuals who bankroll @entity13 and his like should know that when they cross the line and engage in serious international crimes , their association with him and support for him will bar their ability to enjoy the luxurious @entity252 lifestyle that so many of them crave			0
‘ people carrying dirty money and individuals with blood on their hands should not be welcome on the streets of @entity2			0
this is not just a question of moral principle			0
‘ sooner or later , if we keep allowing such unsavoury characters into the @entity2 , bringing all their baggage and vendettas with them , we risk finding that it is @entity2 citizens who are caught in the crossfire or worse			0
’ the campaign to name @entity13 associates banned from @entity2 was inspired by @entity272 , a @entity5 lawyer who was tortured and murdered in 2009 whilst detained , on instructions from the @entity274 , for exposing a $ 230 million tax fraud committed by @entity13 ’s ‘ cronies ’			1
in the @entity64 , a law was introduced banning the @entity5 officials allegedly involved in the killing from entering the country			0
all have been publicly named by the @entity282 administration			0
@entity23 have been calling for a similar law in the @entity2 since 2012			0
yet , while promising to similarly exclude the guilty men , the @entity195 refuses to say who has been banned – raising fears a number of those responsible have been allowed to slip through the net to avoid offending @entity13			0
@entity235 mp @entity234 has accused of kowtowing to @entity5 by refusing to publicly identify @entity13 ‘ henchmen ’ with links to the @entity2 on monday evening , a band of senior mps – including the chairmen of seven @entity298 select committees - attempted to introduce a clause to the @entity297			1
this would have forced the government to identify the people who it had excluded from the country and , therefore , those who remain free to travel here			0
however , despite the continued @entity5 hostility to @entity2 , home office minister @entity305 was ordered to block the legislation in order to not offend ‘ international relations and foreign policy objectives ’			1
a string of prominent @entity235 backbenchers had backed the naming of @entity13 ’s ‘ henchmen ’ , including ex-solicitor general sir @entity314 , who said the case for changing the law was ‘ unassailable ’			0
mr @entity234 accused the @entity195 officials blocking the legislation of burying their heads in ‘ a comfortable secrecy and lack of transparency ’			0
the government ’s ‘ unbelievable ’ stance also angered campaigners			0
the @entity2 businessman @entity326 , who employed mr @entity272 , said : ‘ who are @entity2 ministers serving here ? they are more worried about a dictator in a foreign country than in keeping the @entity2 people safe			2
‘ the @entity5 torturers and murderers lobby seems to hold a lot more sway here in the @entity2 than the @entity64			2
’ justifying the decision , mrs @entity305 said changing the law would have ‘ serious implications for the security of our borders and therefore to the national security of the country ’			0
she added : ‘ there is a further risk that publication of individuals excluded from the @entity2 may undermine international relations and foreign policy objectives			0
‘ that risk is intensified if the excluded individual has connections with a foreign government or well known organisation that may be working in partnership with the @entity2 to broaden our interests abroad			0
‘ also , ongoing investigations into the activities of an individual could be jeopardised if they became aware of the fact that they were on the list			0

about 75 soldiers will be deployed to carry out ' defensive ' infantry training
@entity10 revealed troop deployment to mps on @entity31
he said @entity2 should not allow @entity5 to swallow up small @entity76 states
mr @entity0 said @entity13 's goal to swallow up new territory becoming clear
he said if @entity2 did not act now @entity13 would target @entity88 and @entity89 states
@entity2 personnel will be deployed to @entity3 over the next few weeks
