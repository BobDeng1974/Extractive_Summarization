the taxman enjoys a ‘ cosy ’ relationship with the accountants who help multinationals avoid billions in tax , a damning report will claim today			2
a powerful committee of @entity7 claims weak law enforcement means tax avoidance – and evasion – remains ‘ a risk worth taking ’			1
the @entity12 said @entity13 is failing to sufficiently tackle ‘ widespread ’ tax avoidance by @entity16 giants , including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity20 , chair of the @entity12 , said @entity13 needs to come down hard on companies who use artificial overseas offices to avoid tax , and the firms that advise them they must also do more to challenge the accountancy firms which help these multinationals to dodge their liabilities , the group will say			1
major corporations have been accused of funnelling billions of pounds through tax havens such as @entity33 and @entity34 to reduce their bill			0
they are accused of exploiting a loophole which enables them to pay tax in the country where they are based , rather than where they sell their goods			0
by setting up ‘ artificial ’ offices in low - tax countries , they are able to pay a much lower annual levy on their profits			0
today , the @entity12 will say that the taxman must do more to ‘ challenge ’ these tactics , saying : ‘ @entity13 needs to show that it comes down hard on tax cheats and change the perception that it is far too tolerant of those who break the law by hiding their income			1
‘ the current system still causes the odds to be stacked in favour of tax evaders using offshore accounts when the worst that will happen if they are caught is that they will pay the tax they owe and a fine			2
’ @entity19 , @entity17 and @entity70 have all previously been found to funnel profits through tax havens , despite earning that money in the @entity74 it added : ‘ @entity13 has not been sufficiently challenging of the manifestly artificial tax arrangements of multinationals			1
’ the report was critical of large @entity74 accountancy firms , such as @entity79 , which it claimed advised many multinationals on how to pay less tax in the @entity74 through the use of complex schemes			0
they accused @entity13 of not doing enough to ‘ challenge ’ this tax advice and instead focusing on the multinationals themselves			1
@entity20 , chair of the @entity12 and a @entity90 mp , said : ‘ we remain concerned that @entity13 ’s relationship with these large accountancy firms is too cosy , and it needs to get much tougher in challenging the advice they give to their clients			1
‘ it is disappointing that @entity13 has rejected our recommendation for a tougher code of conduct for tax advisers - a response which is out of kilter with its wider policy to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance			1
‘ furthermore , we do not believe there are enough prosecutions for tax evasion to act as an effective deterrent to those who break the law			0
as it stands , tax avoidance – and even evasion – can be a risk worth taking			1
‘ we are not persuaded that @entity13 and the @entity116 are doing enough to prosecute serious tax evasion cases			2
’ the report also found that part of the problem was @entity74 ’s hopelessly complex tax system			0
they said the number of different tax breaks open to businesses and individuals had grown under the @entity127 by almost 100 to 1,140			0
these many tax reliefs were open to abuse and difficult to keep track of			0
the report said : ‘ for as long as the @entity74 has such a complex tax code , opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance and evasion will continue to be exploited			1
’ the report named management firms , such as @entity79 , as being among those who advised their clients on how to reduce their tax bill it added that ‘ @entity13 must urgently transform its currently unacceptable levels of customer service ’			2
they claimed the taxman ’s target to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes was ‘ unambitious and inadequate ’ and noted that @entity13 expected its performance in 2014 - 15 to be ‘ worse ’ than the previous year			2
it comes as the @entity149 revealed it was joining forces with five other tax authorities to examine how digital multinational companies shift their profits to tax havens			0
@entity155 told @entity7 the co-operation was part of the diverted profits tax project - or so - called ‘ @entity18 tax ’ - announced in the @entity160 last week and aimed at clamping down on tax avoidance			1
from the start of next month , companies who artificially funnel profits offshore to avoid paying @entity74 tax will face a 25 per cent levy on that money			0
yesterday , mr @entity155 told @entity7 : ‘ as part of this project i can confirm we are working with five other tax authorities to investigate and challenge how digital multinationals shift their profits to tax havens			0
‘ for the first time we are gathering a full global picture of the tax risks these companies pose			0
that is invaluable in helping us to take decisive action			0
’ a spokesman for @entity13 said : ‘ we are pleased that the committee recognises the progress that @entity13 has made in clamping down on tax evasion and avoidance , by relentlessly pursuing those who seek to cheat the system			1
‘ we have shut down marketed avoidance schemes , closed loopholes , secured tough new enforcement powers , and opened up international information exchanges so rich evaders will have no safe havens where they can hide their money			2
‘ as a result of our compliance efforts and the £ 1billion extra investment over this @entity197 , we have secured more than £ 100 billion in additional revenues in the past five years to pay for essential public services , raised penalties for tax evasion to 200 per cent of tax owed and increased prosecutions five-fold			2

@entity12 said @entity13 is failing to tackle tax avoidance
chair @entity20 said harsher penalties are needed for those caught
weak enforcement means ' tax avoidance can be a risk worth taking '
