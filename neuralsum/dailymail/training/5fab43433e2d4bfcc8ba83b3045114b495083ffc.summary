an amateur metal detectorist has unearthed one of the largest hoards of roman coins ever found in @entity4			1
@entity5 , 51 , made the discovery as he explored land near @entity8 , in @entity9 - and he was so concerned someone would steal it , he camped out for three nights while archaeologists excavated the site			1
dubbed @entity15 , the collection of 22,000 copper - alloy coins is thought to have been buried by a private individual or soldier for safe keeping , but was never recovered			1
dubbed @entity15 , it was declared treasure at a @entity25 earlier this month			1
this means it is eligible for acquisition by a museum , once it has been valued by the @entity31 in addition to being one of the largest hoards - behind the @entity35 of 52,503 found in 2010 , and a hoard of 22,703 found in @entity37 in @entity38 in 1989 - mr @entity5 's discovery is also one of the best preserved 4th century collections to be dug up			1
earlier this month , mr @entity5 's hoard was declared treasure at a @entity25			1
this means it is eligible for acquisition by a museum , once it has been valued by the @entity31 - a group of independent experts who advise the secretary of state			0
according to @entity55 , @entity56 , the @entity4 copper - alloy coins date back to between ad 260 and ad 348 and bear the images of @entity50 , his family , co-emperors and immediate predecessors and successors			1
mr @entity56 said it was a critical time in @entity60 and world history , @entity4 ’s fortunes were fluctuating			2
‘ there was economic prosperity while @entity4 avoided the invasions and civil wars that ravaged the continent , ' said mr @entity56			2
‘ romanised farms , or villas including several in @entity9 , were at their richest			2
' but the province was ultimately drawn into @entity71 power struggles that , along with increasing attacks from @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 tribes , resulted in the rapid decline and end of @entity4 rule			2
‘ @entity81 areas such as @entity9 were on the front - line , and this may be the context for the coin hoard			1
‘ there were no high street banks , so a good , deep hole in the ground was as secure a place as any to hide your savings in times of trouble , or if you were going away on a long journey			0
‘ but whoever made this particular deposit never came back to retrieve it			0
’ by comparison , the @entity35 was valued at £ 320,000 - so , in theory , the collection could cost in the region of £ 100,000			0
however , the @entity35 contained a mixture of silver and copper , so was considered more valuable			0
at the time the hoard was buried , it would have amounted to four gold coins , or solidi , which would have provided the ration of two soldiers for one year , or a worker ’s pay for two years			2
professor @entity113 from @entity114 told @entity115 : our knowledge of ancient prices is very patchy indeed , and the purchasing power of money varied enormously over time and space			0
' the amount of money in this hoard would at some points have been the equivalent to a soldier 's total salary for two years ; at other dates it would have bought the services of a skilled craftsmen for perhaps 80 days ; it could buy maybe 1,000 or so pints of @entity133 beer ( or double quantities of @entity136 beer , which was n't so good ) or enough grain to feed someone for two years or so			2
' if you try to turn any of those into modern figures , then , it 's clearly not the sort of fortune that would allow you to retire comfortably or buy a nice country estate ; on the other hand , in a world where most people were living close to subsistence level and would have few if any savings , it 's pretty impressive that someone had amassed enough money to live on for a year or so			0
' the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) in @entity156 , which already houses a large collection of local @entity160 - @entity159 objects , has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase the coins			2
mr @entity5 originally made the discovery in november 2013 , while operating under licence on private land near the previously excavated site of a @entity4 villa at @entity168 in @entity9			1
the coins were buried in a pit , and may have once been held in a bag , which did not survive			0
the hoard was excavated by a team of archaeologists , and were cleaned so they could be identified by experts at the @entity177			0
according to @entity55 , @entity56 , the @entity4 copper - alloy coins ( pictured ) date back to between ad 260 and ad 348 and bear the images of @entity50 , his family , co-emperors and immediate predecessors and successors it was also reported to landowner @entity185 , in accordance with the @entity187			1
mr @entity5 said : ' it ’s by far the biggest find i ’ve ever had			2
it really does n’t get any better than this			0
‘ between finding the hoard and the archaeologists excavating the site , i slept in my car alongside it for three nights to guard it			0
‘ on this occasion , the ground where i was working was quite flinty and i found what i thought were two roman coins which is actually quite unusual in @entity9			1
‘ as i began working in a grid formation in the surrounding area i had a signal on the metal detector which means that there is probably iron involved			0
‘ most detectors are set up to ignore iron but i decided to dig the earth at that spot and immediately reached some iron ingots which were laid directly on top of the coins			0

mr @entity56 said : ‘ our archaeologists and the team at the @entity177 have reported that the majority of the coins are so well preserved that they were able to date them very accurately			0
