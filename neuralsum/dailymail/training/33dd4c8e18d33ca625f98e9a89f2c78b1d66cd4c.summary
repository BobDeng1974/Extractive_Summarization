by @entity0 professor @entity2 's review is also expected to suggest that the number of @entity5 departments should not be reduced and in some cases may need to be made bigger paramedics will be urged to drop patients off at their gp or high street chemist rather than taking them to casualty , under @entity13 guidelines			1
officials also want ambulance staff to treat less seriously - ill patients in their own homes and only bring them to hospital if necessary			2
this week the @entity13 ’s medical director , professor sir @entity2 , will publish a major report setting out what needs to be improved in @entity5 units to avert a crisis this winter			1
many departments are already struggling to cope with the combination of a steady rise in patients and drastic shortages of senior doctors			1
the numbers of patients turning up in @entity5 has soared by a third in the past decade , which has partly been blamed on a failure of @entity9 out - of - hours services and an ageing population			1
at the same time , fewer doctors are wanting to specialise in ‘ emergency ’ medicine as it involves working out - of - hours			0
senior doctors fear this winter may be one of the busiest yet with the numbers of patients rising further with the onset of the norovirus and flu			2
the report , to be published on wednesday , is likely to urge paramedics to be more involved in diagnosing and treating patients rather than just ferrying them to hospital			1
outlining his plans earlier this autumn , sir @entity2 said : ‘ historically ambulances have been about transporting people from one place to another			2
‘ increasingly we ’ve seen ambulances treating people in their own home , delivering clot - busting drugs , treating severe asthma , treating heart attacks and delivering the early stages of stroke treatment			0
‘ there is more that ambulances services and others can do in providing early treatment			0
’ he added ambulances could also be used to drop patients off at gp surgeries if they were n’t found to be seriously ill , at a chemist or at home			2
the report may also suggest @entity5 units start specialising in treating certain conditions or injuries – such as heart attacks and stroke or traffic accidents			1
an @entity13 report due to be published this week is expected to advise paramedics not to take as many patients to @entity5 officials believe that although patients would have to travel further to reach the most appropriate centre , they would receive a higher standard of treatment			1
experts also expect the @entity13 will eventually have to reduce the number of a&es in @entity93 to save money although this is unlikely to be announced this week			0
only last week the @entity95 , which represents @entity5 doctors , urged patients to stockpile medicines and call @entity13 111 rather than going to casualty			1
dr @entity100 , a senior member of the college and consultant at @entity104 ’s @entity103 , said : ‘ we are getting ready for what may be our worst winter yet			0
‘ this , in the face of rising demand , is a real issue for us			0
we are concerned about providing a safe and quality service this winter			0
‘ people should look after themselves this winter			0
they should keep simple remedies in the house , they should try to talk to their gp if they can , they should use the 111 service and then only as a last resort , if any of these fail , access the emergency departments			0

professor @entity2 's review suggests taking most patients to hospitals does not always offer the best care
the report will also say that in some cases @entity5 departments should not be reduced but *expanded*
