the average @entity2 person has just one ten - thousandth of the net worth of @entity4 , a study revealed today			1
using a formula common in probate cases , legal experts calculated the value of the average @entity10 's property equity , savings , pensions , investments , cars and possessions			1
they came up with a figure of just £ 147,134 - less than the asking price currently advertised for a parking space in @entity20 's sought - after @entity19			1
ten thousand times richer than you : @entity4 and his wife @entity22			2
the former @entity24 and @entity25 ace has a net worth of £ 165million - compared to the average @entity10 's net worth of £ 147,134 it 's less than 0.01 per cent the value of former @entity25 and @entity24 football icon @entity4 's estimated fortune , which was calculated last year to be £ 165million			1
and it is just over a millionth of the net worth of the @entity2 's richest resident , @entity34 mining mogul @entity33 , who has a net worth of £ 13.3billion according to the @entity36			1
the calculations include the average person 's current pension pot estimated in the region of £ 30,000 , with mortgage equity accounting for an average of £ 75,000			2
the study of the assets of 2,000 adults found that 46 per cent had ' no idea ' , while 11 per cent do n't know what the term even means			0
it found that 42 per cent of adults do n't think they are worth very much in monetary terms , and yet have a mortgage equity of at least £ 75,060.45			2
in addition , a further £ 5,603.98 is stowed away in a savings account , on average , and another £ 3,712.65 building interest in an @entity56 the average @entity2 adult has around £ 1,348.16 in their current bank account at any one time and puts money into a pension which is estimated to currently stand in the region of £ 30,000			1
finally , people can take their belongings into account by including the value of the car they own and the items in their home - which are worth an average of £ 6,706.55 and £ 15,077.90 respectively			1
worth a million times more than you : @entity34 mining mogul @entity33 is @entity2 's richest resident , according to the @entity36 2013 that 's a grand total net worth of just over £ 147,000			1
that 's a lot of money for most @entity2 , and might even be enough for @entity4 to think hard about			1
but it 's mere pocket change for the country 's richest residents			1
after mr @entity33 , the next wealthiest men who choose to live in @entity2 are @entity84 - born @entity83 businessman @entity82 - worth an estimated 10billion - and the @entity87 brothers @entity85 and @entity88 - jointly worth £ 10.6billion			1
@entity89 , a wills , trusts and estates expert at solicitors @entity93 , which carried out the study , said : ' many @entity2 adults feel they have very few assets to their name and consequently is it not worth them making a will			2
' but the reality is very different , in that most people will have assets tied up in investments they would n't even think would count			0
' so while the average @entity2 adult does n't have millions tucked away like @entity4 they should still make sensible provisions and arrangements for their future			1
' despite the facts and figures demonstrating the value of the average adult , six in 10 still do n't have any sort of will in place , while a third have no plans to make a will because they do n't ever think they 'll need one			2
having no assets , having nothing to leave anyone and being in debt for the rest of their lives are some of the most common reasons why well over 16 million adults have no intention of getting the appropriate paperwork in place in the event of their death			0
in addition , 47 per cent of people do n't know how assets are distributed after death , while 54 per cent are clueless about what accounts and investments their partner or family has			0
ms @entity89 added : ' planning for the future is vital			0
many people are attempting to save money by not making wills and then when the inevitable happens , they do it themselves in relation to the estate administration			0
' what they find is that this is a specialist area of law and there are potentially serious pitfalls			0
' while some may feel they can save money by avoiding legal advice , our experience is that such an outlook can create a false economy			2
' this is because ultimately , if they do go it alone and subsequently hit problems , then it can be more expensive to sort out the situation in the long run			0
' common issues from failing to take advice include incorrectly distributing the estate and a lack of awareness of the tax issues which surround administering an estate - this can lead to missed tax deadlines and potential penalty charges			0
' also , with specialist advice , they may be able to look at ways to reduce the burden of inheritance tax to the benefit of families and charities			0
' finally , without the relevant experience , people may often be unable to properly and thoroughly assess all of the assets and debts of the deceased - an issue in itself which makes it more likely that distribution of the estate will not be undertaken correctly			0
' the consequences of getting such issues wrong can be serious and @entity196 representatives are personally and financially liable for any mistakes they make			0
