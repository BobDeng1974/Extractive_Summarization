the prime minister said @entity5 had suffered a ‘ frightening ’ decade of ‘ completely lax ’ border policies , which had placed huge strain on communities			2
and he hinted at further measures to cut the number of people arriving in the @entity5			2
his comments come after the @entity18 warned @entity5 would need millions more immigrants in the coming decades to offset the effects of an ageing population			1
but mr @entity2 made clear yesterday that he wants to accelerate progress towards meeting his pledge to slash annual net migration – the number by which the population grows after both immigration and emigration have been counted – to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
during a question and answer session with workers at the headquarters of @entity34 in @entity35 , mr @entity2 was asked why @entity5 lets in immigrants who are a ‘ constant drain ’ while others ‘ work hard ’			1
he replied : ‘ i basically agree with you			2
there are some benefits from being a country that welcomes people who want to come here and work hard			0
‘ but in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that ’s completely lax			0
the pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great			0
’ mr @entity2 said the government has capped the number of migrants from outside the @entity53 by cracking down on bogus colleges			1
he also highlighted action to reduce the so - called ‘ pull factors ’ that attract people to this country , such as restricting access to benefits and the @entity61			1
agreement : mr @entity2 made his comments in response to a question posed during a @entity67 session at the @entity34 factory in @entity35 but he added : ‘ i want to see it [ net migration ] coming down faster			1
‘ on housing , health , education and legal aid we are showing we are not a soft touch			0
‘ by the end of this government , we will be able to look back and say we may not have sorted out the whole problem , but we have got a much tougher approach to immigration that ’s fair			0
’ in the run - up to the 2010 election mr @entity2 pledged to cut net migration by more than a half , from more than 200,000 a year to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
progress in reducing the numbers has been frustrated by resistance from the @entity90 and by the difficulty of limiting immigration from the @entity53			0
last year the number of immigrants dropped by 89,000 to 153,000			1
but the fall was accompanied by warnings that limiting immigration could harm @entity5 ’s economy in the long - term			0
earlier this month , an @entity18 report warned an extra seven million migrants would be needed over the next 50 years to balance the effects of an ageing population			0
the figure is equal to 140,000 migrants per year			0
the report concluded that without a fresh wave of immigration to boost employment and tax receipts , @entity5 ’s public finances could become ‘ unsustainable ’			0
the @entity18 ’s analysis suggests that @entity5 ’s borrowing as a proportion of gdp would rise to 99 per cent if there is a steady flow of immigrants			2
but if there was a complete ban on immigrants , borrowing would rise to 174 per cent of gdp .			2
