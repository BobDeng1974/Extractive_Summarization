it seemed a very daunting yuletide challenge ; could i find an exciting , quality array of presents to satisfy even the most fussy of school children for a total of just $ 150 ? in previous years , shopping for our two children , aged four and six , is usually done in bursts of frenzied grabs at our local mall between food shopping and scavenging around for presents for teachers			1
in short , i 've probably over spent amid the rush and my lack of planning and regretting it in january when the credit card bill lands heavily in the mailbox			0
a @entity23 reporter was sent on a quest to find a quality array of presents to satisfy school children for a total of $ 150			1
the cheapest being board game @entity28 , at @entity30 , for $ 6 other potential gifts include mr @entity32 ( left ) ceramic mug with toffees , @entity35 , $ 5 and @entity36 ( right ) , @entity37 , @entity35 , $ 5 61 @entity38 , @entity39 , which costs $ 16.99 was the most expensive @entity40 present on the list it 's the same financial hangover for many , with shoppers predicted by the @entity44 to spend at least $ 6.5 billion in the shops this year and a further billion on online gifts			1
so this venture for @entity48 was quite the revelation			0
i had a strict budget and a tight deadline ; it was time to switch off my phone for once and focus			0
and in just a few hours at @entity56 , in @entity57 which is southeast of @entity58 , i was amazed to find an exciting mix of presents in many of the major stores including @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity30 , @entity39 , @entity35 and @entity65			1
rather than just diving into the toy aisles and aiming mindlessly for the well known expensive brands , the exercise made me also look carefully in the less obvious areas such as sports and camping			2
and what gems i found , many of which may well inspire the whole family during the lengthy summer school holidays			0
the inflatable raft boat with oars , which can be found at @entity30 , retailing for $ 15 @entity80 tennis balls ( left ) , @entity65 , $ 8 for five and @entity81 , @entity63 , for $ 8 pulse portable mini @entity83 speaker ( left ) , @entity64 , $ 15 and @entity84 ( right ) , @entity63 , $ 12 zinc scooter , @entity63 , which usually retails for $ 19 but currently has 20 per cent off which brings the cost down to $ 15.20 1 ) kid 's @entity88 , @entity30 , $ 20 2 ) 61 @entity90 , @entity39 , $ 16.99 3 ) zinc scooter , @entity63 , ( usually $ 19 but currently has 20 per cent off ) $ 15.20 4 ) pulse portable mini @entity83 speaker , @entity64 , $ 15 5 ) @entity28 4 , @entity30 , $ 6 6 ) @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity35 , $ 5 7 ) @entity95 , @entity64 , $ 12 8 ) @entity84 , @entity63 , $ 12 9 ) @entity96 , @entity30 , $ 10 10 ) @entity81 , @entity63 , $ 8 11 ) @entity97 , @entity65 , $ 8 12 ) mr @entity32 ceramic mug with toffees , @entity35 , $ 5 13 ) inflatable raft boat with oars , @entity30 , $ 15 total : $ 148.19 from inflatable boats and keyboards to cup cake makers and fishing rods			1
all suitable for both boys and girls , with the added benefits of several prices reduced as the major stores compete fiercely for our @entity40 dollars			0
it soon became clear sticking to a strict budget does n't mean a dreary @entity40 for the children			0
these gifts will mean a huge pile of presents to unwrap and may even turn into some fun new hobbies			2
the metal detector gift alone will potentially amuse the kids for hours at the beach			0
it also turned out some major retailers are doing their own brand version of classic toys such as @entity128 - at quarter of the price			0
particularly @entity30 with their ' @entity132 ' game at just $ 6			1
our children may just have their best @entity40 ( and school holidays ) yet			2
@entity136 's @entity88 , which can also be found at @entity30 , for $ 20 @entity95 ( left ) , @entity64 , $ 12 and @entity96 ( right ) , @entity30 , $ 10			1

it has been predicted that shoppers will spend at least $ 6.5 billion in the shops this year
they are expected to spend another billion while shopping online for gifts
