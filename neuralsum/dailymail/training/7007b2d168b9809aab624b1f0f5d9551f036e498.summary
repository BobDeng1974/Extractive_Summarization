by @entity1 reporter published : 13:06 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 13:08 est , 19 march 2014 a father and his 15 - year - old son who died while cave diving on @entity7 had run out of air while descending to dangerous depths , investigators have said			1
the bodies of @entity11 , 35 , and his son @entity12 were found hours after they went diving at the @entity15 cave in @entity16 , @entity17 last december			1
a sheriff 's office investigation has found that pair died accidentally after apparently losing track of time and diving to 233 feet while using just air in their tanks			1
tragic : @entity28 , 35 , and his 15 - year - old son @entity12 were found dead following a cave dive last december after they lost track of time and ran out of air , authorities concluded the depth meant that the duo - who were not certified in cave diving - should have used a trimix combination for their breathing instead of just air , rescue diver @entity34 told the @entity42			1
he added that they should n't have gone deeper than 218 feet due to possible toxic effects			0
rescuers found @entity11 's body floating 120 feet below the surface with his breathing device out of his mouth - an indication that he had perhaps tried to give his son air after the teenager ran out			2
rescue divers added in the report that they believe the boy then panicked and attempted to swim to the surface because he did not have his mouthpiece intact and his mask was around his neck			0
unprepared : the duo , who were trying out new equipment , were not certified to dive in caves the teenager 's body was found 67 feet below the surface			2
divers found the duo 's tanks had run out of air and their light sources had run out of battery			2
the father and son had left home at 7am to test out new diving equipment at @entity77 , but found that it was flooded so headed to @entity78 , arriving at around 11am			1
@entity11 's fiancee @entity79 started to worry when the two did n't return and she could n't get through to @entity11 on his cell phone			1
she called law enforcement around 3pm			0
she finally drove out there herself and found their car was still parked in the lot , and then began calling family members			0
danger : they were diving at the @entity15 cave in @entity16 , @entity17 cave : authorities said @entity12 , right , and his father had the right equipment but not the right training recovery divers started searching the waters an hour later and found both bodies in the main cavern area between 9pm and 10pm			1
divers concluded that the men had the proper equipment to dive , but they did not have the experience			0
@entity11 only had a certification for open water diving , and his son had no certification			2
@entity15 does not check diver certifications			0
on the approach to @entity78 , there are warning signs that tell just how dangerous the diving there is			0
diving site @entity115 has named the @entity118 cave as ' one of the top three extreme dives in the world '			0
warning : there are signs at the cave warning people against diving unless they are certified ' only for highly experienced cave divers and the technically sound , the descent of @entity15 's nest is similar to that of a chimney and hundreds of feet below it opens up into a large cavern called " the @entity137 " , beyond which are longer tunnels and crannies that go even deeper , ' the website said			1
multiple divers have perished attempting the descent into @entity78 over the past 20 years .			0

@entity28 , 35 , and his son @entity12 , 15 , went diving @entity7 *morning* to try out new equipment they received as presents
father and son went to @entity78 , one of the *toughest* dives in the world , even though neither were certified cave divers
an investigation *revealed* that both men had run out of *oxygen* after apparently losing track of time and diving too deep
the duo were reported *missing* by @entity11 's fiancee when they failed to return home and their bodies were recovered that night
