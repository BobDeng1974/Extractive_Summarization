the note that @entity2 bombing suspect @entity1 wrote on the wall of the boat where he was found after a massive manhunt has been released , showing the motivation behind the fatal attack			1
stains of either red paint or blood are shown dripping down through the angry note and some words were blasted away by bullet holes			1
' the @entity15 government is killing our innocent civilians , but most of you already know that … i ca n’t stand to see such [ bullet hole ] go unpunished , ' the hand - scribbled note obtained by @entity22 says			1
final words : photos of the note that @entity1 wrote inside a boat where he has captured have now been released showing what his thoughts were in the wake of the bombing that killed 3 and injured 260 censored by a bullet hole : some of the words in the note are blocked out by bullet holes and either blood or paint ' we @entity39 are one body			1
you kill one of us , you hurt [ bullet hole ] us all			0
' much more was included in the note but very little of it is legible			0
the note was written on the side of the wall of the boat in a backyard in @entity51 , @entity52 where @entity1 was found			1
earlier reports noted that the phrase ' @entity55 ' was included somewhere but the photo released on thursday did not show that portion			0
@entity1 , the now - 20 - year - old charged with helping his older brother @entity58 set off two bombs at the finish line of the @entity2 last april , is currently awaiting trial and is being held in solitary confinement at a prison in @entity52			1
under a spell : the denfense s planning on describing how @entity1 was under his brother 's control when he participated in the dual bombing at the @entity2 in 2013 ( pictured : then - 19 - year - old @entity1 being captured ) @entity22 reports that his defense team did not have a comment about the note			1
just yesterday , a judge ruled that @entity1 can be visited by his relatives without an @entity76 agent present			1
he had previously been watched during the visits , but his defense attorneys argued that there was no clear threat and the agent 's presence prevented the family from speaking freely			0
' this case is very much a story about a family and the relationships between them , ' defense attorney @entity84 said in a court hearing on wednesday			0
family ties : defense attorneys for @entity1 ( right ) argued that he did not need an agent present when he met with his sister in prison and they are trying to understand the relationship he had with his older , now - deceased brother @entity58 ( left ) the judge agreed with the defense 's point , pushing past the prosecution 's suggestion that the minder was needed for security			2
' i do n’t think the safety , security issue looms very large , ' @entity15 district judge @entity106 ruled			2
the @entity110 reported that the decision will not be final until the @entity112 weighs in , and that is expected to take about two weeks			0
the agent 's presence is not only a question of security but could also have a role in the trial as it was earlier reported that during one of these visits , the agent allegedly heard @entity120 say something controversial in a heated exchange with his sister			0
' @entity1 , despite the presence of an @entity76 agent and an employee of the federal public defender , was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent , ' a late february court hearing stated			2
prosecutors later said that the remark was ' the driving force ' behind @entity1 's defense team 's decision to push for a change in the visitation procedure			0
the strategy also suggests that the defense team is preparing to paint @entity1 , who was 19 at the time of last year 's bombings , as under the mental control of his 26 - year - old brother @entity58 who was killed in a shoot out with police			0
paying respects : the court decisions come just one day after the anniversary of the bombings ( the @entity154 finish line pictured on tuesday during a memorial ceremony )			2
