by @entity0 last updated at 2:43 pm on 8th october 2011 @entity1 failed to keep control of his emotions last night as he was sent off in shame during @entity6 's match against @entity7 - the day after his father and uncle were arrested and bailed in connection with a ' football betting scam '			1
the £ 180,000 - a - week @entity13 star , who is worth £ 37million , lost control 17 minutes from time and kicked out at @entity16			1
it led @entity6 , who were winning 2 - 1 , to concede a last minute goal			1
and it provoked a stern response from angry manager @entity22 who , despite seeing his team qualify for @entity24 , appeared to utter an @entity26 expletive in the direction of the disgraced player as he passed him			1
scroll down to see video of last night 's sending off ... off : @entity1 was dismissed during the second half of @entity6 's match against @entity7 after fouling @entity16 kicking out : @entity33 was shown a straight red card for a moment of petulance @entity22 had said on the eve of the game that @entity33 was ' focused and calm ' following the arrest of his father , also called @entity1 , and his uncle @entity41			1
the pair were arrested on thursday and bailed in connection with a spot - fixing investigation			1
following last night 's sending off , @entity33 is now automatically banned from the opening game of @entity24 - probably the first two - although @entity48 will decide the length of his suspension towards the end of next week			1
allegation : @entity1 and @entity33 sit alongside the @entity13 star 's father @entity53 ( right ) who was arrested in connection with a betting scam @entity33 is only the second @entity6 player to be sent off twice - the other being former captain @entity58			1
@entity6 drew 2 - 2 to secure top spot in @entity60 but @entity22 said : ' he made a silly mistake when he kicked the opponent			1
the arrests of @entity1 's father , uncle and seven other men followed a police probe into a rash of ' suspicious bets ' placed on a sending - off			1
police were alerted after the @entity72 raised concerns about a number of irregular bets , ranging from £ 200 to £ 500 , on @entity77 's @entity76 being red - carded , after he swore at the referee in a match against @entity80 in december 2010			1
jennings had already been booked by referee @entity82 when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time			2
the 26 - year - old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to ' stop cheating ' @entity77			2
some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in @entity89 - @entity33 's home town			1
one bet of £ 500 , placed at odds of 10/1 , netted £ 5,000			2
former boxer @entity53 , 48 , was arrested in a 7am raid at the lavish £ 450,000 home the striker bought for his parents in @entity96 , @entity89			2
@entity97 , 54 , was arrested at his home in @entity99 , @entity89 , while @entity76 , a former @entity101 players who hails from @entity102 , near @entity89 , was arrested at his home in @entity104			2
the alleged betting scam is said to be worth £ 100,000			2
all men deny the allegations			1
' and he will now not be able to play the first game in the @entity110			2
it 's a red card			2
you ca n't defend that			2
' i 'm not happy , absolutely			0
he made a silly mistake and he said , " yes , sorry "			0
more than that , i ca n't do			0
' he 's a really important player with a lot of experience and he 's played really important games			0
but it 's a silly mistake			0
' @entity33 was not happy because he missed some control and some passes			1
for this reason , i think he reacted			0
his reaction was to kick the opponent			0
' it will be good lesson for him and the team			1
the player is frustrated from on the pitch not from what happened away from it			0
' goals from @entity135 and @entity136 gave @entity6 an early 2 - 0 lead but they were pegged back to 2 - 2 by a goal in the final seconds of each half			0
@entity22 added : ' i ca n't enter into the head of @entity1 when he plays			1
' i can find different solutions			0
but the reaction of the players , you can not understand during the game , why things happen			0
' when @entity149 equalised in stoppage time at the end of the game , the home crowd went crazy			0
the draw clinches second place for them and a chance to qualify through a play - off			0
home fans invaded the pitch and taunted the @entity6 fans			0
@entity6 's players ran for the tunnel to avoid the stampede			0
it ought to have been a night of celebration for @entity22 's team but the late goal and @entity33 's red card took off the gloss			1
@entity7 manager @entity169 said : ' i read in the newspapers that @entity33 has some family problems in @entity6			1
to be honest , i did n't expect him to play			0
' @entity173 said after the game that the @entity6 players had been disappointed by the antics of their opponents			0
he claimed @entity6 had met with physical intimidation and questioned why there was not a red card for @entity7 .			0

team left hanging on with 10 men to scrape into @entity184 after dismissal
@entity22 says @entity33 *apologised* to him after match
