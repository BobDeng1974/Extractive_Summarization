picture of innocence : @entity2 and @entity3 children were supposed to be seen and not heard but records how the reality was quite different the @entity2 era was a golden age for the middle classes			1
industrialists , bankers and clerks were all able to send their children to school to the age of 12 or 14			0
in this age of prosperity and enlightenment they were expected to be well - dressed , good - mannered and most importantly - seen and not heard			2
but new research carried out at the @entity18 suggests children were every bit as unruly as they are today			1
phd student @entity21 examined the history of some of the country 's most - used parks in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , which were designed to promote social harmony but became a magnet for anti-social behaviour			1
after sifting through postcards , public records , archaeology and children ’s literature from the period , the ms @entity21 found the children were n’t always the little angels we might think they were			1
she said : ' i do n't agree that @entity2 and @entity3 children were to be seen and not heard			2
' it was supposed to be the golden age for middle class children , who were depicted as angels or fairies in advertisements and literature			0
' but children and children ’s play was a prominent feature of parks and one which was framed by class			2
' working class children , depicted as street urchins , were given a less positive spin , but parks were thought to be a good way to purify and improve them			2
' disorder : @entity62 in @entity28 was one of many opened with the intention of promoting social harmony she added : ' and like today , there was a rowdy and unpredictable side too : while parks were supposed to promote social harmony , this was often resisted and parks could be sites of conflict and contrast			1
' newspapers reported that children and youths were sitting on park benches shouting abuse at passers - by			0
' children would also illegally fish in park lakes for ornamental fish or steal fruit of the trees			0
' the parks ms @entity21 studied include @entity62 in @entity28 , @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity26 , @entity90 in @entity91 and @entity92 in @entity93			1
objects excavated in @entity62 by @entity18 led @entity95 , of which ms @entity21 is part , showed that eating food and drinking alcohol , forbidden in the park bye - laws , took place in the park			1
the team have unearthed marbles from the tops of @entity106 bottles alongside the more expensive coloured glass marbles , showing how children from different social classes played and competed together			0
five stones – a game similar to jacks - was also found at the @entity113			0
made of ceramic , they are among the earliest examples of toy manufacture			0
she said : ' excavated material showed how parks were one of the few places where social classes could mix and compete against each other , particularly children			1
' i hope that my work will inform our understanding of the parks ’ heritage and in doing so will help to inform a vision for their future			0
' children have always had a wild side to their nature ; kids will be kids and this is as true today as it was in the @entity2 and @entity3 eras			0

new research casts doubt on myth that children were ' seen and not heard '
@entity21 from @entity18 examined history of @entity149 's parks
built to promote social harmony - became magnet for anti-social behaviour
