while a formal identification has yet to be made , police said there was little doubt that the body was that of mr @entity19 , for no other @entity34 males had been reported missing on the island or in fact throughout the entire country			1
mr @entity19 , of @entity56 in @entity57 , has not been seen since going trekking on @entity58 last tuesday			2
a search party consisting of commandos , police and firefighters stumbled across the body when they were returning to the base camp at around 12pm local time yesterday , @entity59 reported			1
discovery : @entity2 rescue workers prepare to load a body onto an @entity72 helicopter on @entity58			2
it has not been confirmed whether the body is that of mr @entity19 @entity75 : rescuers have been scouring the area in the hope of finding mr @entity19 for days it was found early this morning near a kayak storage unit near the @entity16 where the 34 - year - old had been working , according to local reports a search party consisting of commandos , police and firefighters stumbled across the body when they were returning to the base camp at around 12pm local time the body was found behind a row of cabins which were occupied by rescue operators over the last three days last night police were investigating two possibilities surrounding the tragic discovery - the death was either accidental or mr @entity19 had met with foul play			1
ms @entity18 who had travelled with her husband to @entity58 island , off the south - eastern coast of @entity2 , broke down in tears and ran to her cabin a short distance away when news of the body ’s discovery was broken to her by deputy police superintendent @entity107			1
earlier she had told of how she was staying positive in the hope that she would be the ‘ friendly face ’ her son needed when he came out of the jungle			0
police closed off the road leading to the sanctuary after the discovery it was found early this morning near a kayak storage unit near the @entity16 where the 34 - year - old had been working , according to local reports in @entity2 the international pressure from mr @entity19 's family and friends , who had feared there was a lack of action in spite of the public response , has turned into efforts on the ground his mother , @entity18 , arrived in @entity2 on monday after prime minister @entity132 spoke to @entity2 's prime minister @entity133 about the search effort @entity19 and his girlfriend kit @entity23			1
she said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions search teams , made up of commandos , police and @entity144 and @entity145 specialists accompanied by sniffer dogs had spent days searching the jungle for the missing @entity148			1
earlier yesterday their hopes of finding him had lifted when they announced they had discovered ‘ a trail ’ - broken twigs and footprints - near the waterfall that mr @entity19 had spoken of trekking to			1

questions police are anxious to find answers to , according to senior officers , surround the movements of mr @entity19 immediately after he announced to others at the centre that he was setting off on the jungle trek to the waterfall			0
with his body being found within the confines of the conservation headquarters , police are questioning whether he even managed to reach the start of the jungle path before tragedy struck in some way			2
police investigations are also looking at the possibility that mr @entity19 did reach the waterfall and plunged into the river on his return			0
a further line of inquiry will be whether he went into the water further upstream and his body was then carried to where it was found			2
members of @entity2 's @entity144 preparing to depart from the @entity213 for the search and rescue operation earlier this week @entity2 authorities insisted they were committed to finding the @entity217 who went missing on the popular resort island seven days ago , with an army helicopter sent to aid the search only ten hours ago a @entity222 page set up to find mr @entity19 posted this message a @entity222 group was set up to raise awareness about mr @entity19 's disappearance			1
