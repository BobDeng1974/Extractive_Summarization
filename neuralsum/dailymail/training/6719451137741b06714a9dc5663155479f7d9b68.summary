we ’ve all wished someone from the future could send us tomorrow ’s lottery ticket numbers			0
while it may seem wishful thinking , a physicist from @entity5 believes that , in theory , it could be possible			0
he argues that if a thin wormhole stays open long enough , people might send messages instantly through time using pulses of light			2
wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space - time			1
a study in may from dr @entity20 at @entity5 argued that if a thin wormhole stayed open long enough , people could send messages through time using pulses of light , or photons space - time can be warped and distorted			1
it takes an enormous amount of matter or energy to create such distortions , but theoretically , distortions are possible			0
in the case of the wormhole , a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space - time			1
imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to represent two points in space - time			1
the line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space - time			1
if the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to warping space - time - then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points , in the same way a wormhole would create a shortcut			1
the problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable			0
when a particle enters a wormhole , it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it			0
the latest study suggests there are unusual - shaped wormholes than may be able to stay open longer than normal			1
it sounds like the stuff of science fiction , but the theory of wormholes being used to send objects through time was first suggested by @entity73 's calculations			0
wormholes are theoretical tunnels through the fabric of space - time that can create shortcuts for long journeys across the universe			1
the problem with his theory is that , if wormholes exist , they do n’t stay open long enough for a human , or even a single particle of light , to pass through them			1
but a new study at @entity5 suggests that some wormholes are capable of staying open long enough to send messages backwards and forwards through time			0
in 1988 , physicist @entity92 at the @entity93 suggested that wormholes might be kept open through the use of a negative energy , known as @entity95			2
according to modern physics , the vacuum is full of fluctuating electromagnetic waves of different possible wavelengths which creates a vast amount of energy , normally invisible to humans			0
between two parallel plates in a vacuum , some energy waves would be too large to fit through creating a negative @entity107 energy			0
@entity73 believed worm holes could open up a window into a different era			0
the problem with his theory is that , if worm holes exist , they do n't stay open long enough for anything to pass through them			2
but a new study at @entity5 suggests unusually - shaped wormholes could stay open longer than normal professor @entity20 ’s recent paper builds on that theory by suggesting that if a wormhole is a lot longer than it is wide , the amount of @entity95 naturally present inside it would be enough to allow it to stay open longer than normal			1
‘ my approach was to see if the wormhole itself – because it has a tube - like structure - could create the same effect as the plates , ’ dr @entity20 told @entity124			1
‘ my calculations showed that if a wormhole is very long compared to how wide it is , you can get negative energy created in the centre of the wormhole			2
‘ it ’s not quite the right sort to keep the wormhole stable – which is what i ’d hoped - but it does mean the wormhole collapses very slowly			0
' the wormhole would be open just long enough , dr @entity20 suggests , to send a photon through to the centre			1
the worm hole would be open just long enough , dr @entity20 suggests , to send a photon through to the other side			1
because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time , if professor @entity20 's theory proves correct , a message could be sent through time because the ends of a wormhole can exist at different points in time , if professor @entity20 ’s theory proves correct , a message could be sent through time			2
dr @entity20 warned a lot more work needs to be down to confirm his theory			2
for instance , scientists still need to find out whether a pulse of light large enough to transmit a meaningful message can get through a collapsing wormhole and whether the pulse can actually escape the wormhole completely			0
‘ more calculations need to be done away from centre closer to mouths to see if the theory holds true , ’ added dr @entity20			2
‘ i would also like to look at the opposite case			0
' could a very short and fat worm hole be able to send messages through time ? ‘ this is all very much theoretical , but the possibilities are intriguing			0

wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space - time
if a message entered a wormhole , it could reach the future or the past
but wormholes are thought to collapse before a message could get out
dr @entity20 argues if a wormhole is longer than it is wide , the amount of negative energy inside would allow it to stay open longer than normal
long enough , he claims , to carry a single particle of light through time
in theory , this photon could carry a message to a distant past or future
