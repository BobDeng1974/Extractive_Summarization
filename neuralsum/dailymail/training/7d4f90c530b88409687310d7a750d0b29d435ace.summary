from a young age , @entity0 had a knack for business			1
she jokes that her life as an entrepreneur began when , as a child , she would steal her grandparents tv remotes and sell them back at an ‘ inflated price ’			0
the @entity10 always considered herself to be ‘ a creative business person ’ and instead of trying to find a job that was the perfect fit , she decided to create one			2

she admits that starting her own business was an enormous leap of faith and is an ongoing challenge			2
‘ you ’re starting from scratch and building something out of nothing , ’ she explains			0
‘ you ’re making something for people to knock and they often knock you personally			2
’ but she says , despite many learning curves , creating a start - up has been incredibly satisfying			1
‘ i would n’t have it any other way			0
it 's what i 'm meant to be doing			0
’ ‘ you have to try stuff and then figure out how to do it later			0
’ @entity0 shares the lessons she has learnt from her experience : @entity0 launched her own opinions site , @entity16 , at the age of 30 and has tips about what to expect when you start your own business ' starting a company is certainly not for everyone			1
it ’s hard work – but setting up a start - up can be one of the most personally gratifying ventures and leaps of calculated faith one can take			1
i love hearing from people all over the country who have taken that leap			0
sometimes , making that jump can involve taking out a second mortgage ; a massive loan , or just starting small , whilst keeping a full time job			0
there are no fast and fixed methods in successfully setting up a start - up , but there are a few secrets that can assist those who are unsure where to even start			2
a fabulous idea is just fabulous until it becomes an idea that could potentially make money , impact others and become a stand - alone concept			0
' a fabulous idea is just fabulous until it becomes an idea that could potentially make money , impact others and become a stand - alone concept , ' says ms @entity0 the one thing i get frustrated by with would - be entrepreneurs is their desire to jump right in , and then give up within 6 months because they had not understood the amount of work it would take and the lag in time until turnover materialises			1
the reality is that it takes time to formulate a strong concept that can go to market			0
it ’s crucial to test your idea on those that are n’t close to you , otherwise , you will be told your concept is brilliant , but when you go to market there is the potential that no one will buy it			2
the feeling of deflation can be overwhelming and may make you feel uncertain , but this can be somewhat avoided by testing the market prior to putting too much money into the concept			0
taking your idea to social media is an effective way to gather instant and constructive feedback			1
social media is an important tool to help test your product , receive feedback and gauge the public 's reaction yes , people can be unbearably mean - spirited because they either dislike the product or because they love to troll but this can work in your favour if you are able to sift through the negativity			1
you quickly find out if your idea is really viable , if it needs to be tweaked or if your price point too high			0
we spent around eight months prior to launching @entity132 everything from audience acquisition to market positioning			2
thirteen months in as a live site i am still testing , tweaking , learning and pivoting			2
it ’s a never ending process that really never ceases no matter what stage your company matures to			0
something what i find important to acknowledge , and many people do n’t like to discuss , is that not everyone in your world will support you			0
starting your own business is in some ways ' a leap of faith ' ( much like bungee - jumping ! ) but it can also be a slow burn , requiring a great deal of patience and perseverance people are funny creatures , they battle with their own insecurities , disappointments and broken dreams – we all do			1
when they perceive you as launching something you are passionate about , they may even want to be happy for you but in my experience many fall to the wayside during the process			0
as hard as this may be , it ’s a good thing to find out , because when the business is struggling or you are having a particularly hard time you want to confide in the right people			1
it can be a lonely journey , but you need good people around you , both to mourn with you during failures and to celebrate your successes			1
the process from idea to start - up can take many forms and there is no ‘ one size fits all ’ approach to getting it right			1
ms @entity0 recommends that a person starting their own business has a good group of people to support them , ' to mourn the disappointments and celebrate the successes ' the truth is , not even the most experienced serial entrepreneur gets it right all the time			1
but if i can advise anyone starting out , it is to focus on your game as an ever - evolving process of learning , tweaking and adjusting to what the market wants , the customers ’ need and the industry demands			1
but equally important , is to be resilient both with what you believe is right for your business , and having enough discernment to surround yourself with the right people			2
growing a business can be hard , and it will take time , but those brave enough will get there eventually and find their rightful place in the start - up space			1
' sometimes , making that jump can involve taking out a second mortgage ; a massive loan , or just starting small , whilst keeping a full time job '			0
