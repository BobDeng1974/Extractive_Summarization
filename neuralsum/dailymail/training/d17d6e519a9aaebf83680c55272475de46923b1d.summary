@entity0 is the bookmakers favourite @entity2 describes vacancy as ' outstanding ' opportunity @entity5 turned down chance to replace @entity7 by @entity8 @entity5 has backed @entity0 to take over the @entity11 manager ’s job - and also endorsed @entity2			1
the former @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 boss ruled himself out of the position after claiming there was ‘ certain criteria ’ he could not adhere to			2
@entity0 is the bookmakers ’ favourite to succeed sacked @entity7 and @entity22 understands contact has been made with the @entity24 , who stepped down at @entity26 in december			1
@entity2 , who spent 12 years at the club mostly as captain , is second - favourite to take the job with bookies and would be a winner with the fans			1
@entity5 described him as an ‘ ideal ’ candidate on @entity48 and @entity2 himself called the job an ‘ outstanding ’ opportunity			1
@entity5 turned down the job after failing to agree terms with owner @entity53			1
it is understood the @entity55 indicated he wanted influence on starting line - ups with particular focus on @entity60 duo @entity59 and @entity61			2
no go : @entity5 's talks with @entity11 over their managerial vacancy have broken down @entity5 told @entity48 : ‘ i am sure someone like @entity0 , who will come in and just coach the team , will end up there			1
‘ in my mind i knew my starting line - up , so if i ca n't 100 per cent go into it knowing that i 'm not going to be able to manage as i manage then i ca n't commit myself			2
‘ in the end it just did n't add up to me			2
i thought i 'd be doing it for the wrong reasons			2
it was n't the financial part of it			2
‘ that 's why i think @entity0 will be the favourite because if you remember he was given players [ at @entity26 ] and it worked for a while			1
interested : @entity2 managed @entity11 for a brief four - month stint in 1996 - 97 season , winning the manager of the month award in january			1
but the @entity11 failed to stay up that year in the @entity37 endorsement : @entity5 believes there is a place at the @entity88 for club @entity89 ‘ @entity2 with his contacts - perhaps he would work with @entity0			1
he is an icon at the club			2
@entity2 , i think , would be ideal			1
’ @entity5 added : ‘ there was nobody you could talk to at the club @entity96 that knew about football ; that you could have a conversation about getting things done			1
‘ they 've got to alter that issue			2
you 've got to know the rules and regulations			0
it just seemed very difficult to get things done at the club			0
’ @entity2 , also speaking to @entity48 , said : ‘ there are some really good jobs out there at times			1
' @entity11 outside the @entity37 is an outstanding job for whatever manager wants it			1
’ chopping block : @entity11 manager @entity7 was sacked after a 5 - 0 beating by @entity112 orders : @entity7 attempts to rally his players during the convincing defeat on saturday at the @entity116 asked about the potential involvement from @entity53 the former @entity118 manager said : ‘ it depends what type of manager you are			1
foreign owners are very prevalent around the @entity127 game now			0
‘ as a manager you have to define what you think is acceptable			0
i would have thought there are certain things any manager would n’t accept and that ’s the picking of the team and players coming through the door being signed by somebody else that you do n’t want			0
they are probably the two golden rules			0
‘ but some managers are different			0
it depends how desperate for a job you are			0
some would want total control			0
‘ i ’m not sure which way they will go			0
that ’s down to the owner			0
they have got their feelers out at the club and they will identify somebody that will do the job well			0
' @entity153 has got the opportunity to showcase himself			1
’ blasted : @entity155 drives home the fourth for @entity112 at @entity116 @entity158 winner @entity157 , meanwhile , welcomed the sacking of @entity7 and called on @entity53 to appoint a manager who would restore the reputation of the club			1
‘ @entity7 was dragging the club that @entity163 and @entity164 turned into what it is into the gutter , ’ said @entity157			1
‘ it ’s a club that has got a good history and it needs propping up again			0
’ he would like to see @entity169 follow in his father ’s footsteps			0
‘ i know from first - hand how @entity169 does it			0
i used to go to the training ground at @entity112 and it was a happy place to be			0
he gets the place bright and vibrant and enjoying things			0
’ meanwhile , former captain @entity178 has taken on an ambassadorial role with the club .			0
