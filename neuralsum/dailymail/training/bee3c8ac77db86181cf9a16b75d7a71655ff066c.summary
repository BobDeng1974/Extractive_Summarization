by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 28 march 2013 @entity2 is considering a radical plan to have customers visiting their stores deliver packages to online buyers on their way home , it was revealed today			1
asking customers to deliver goods would put the world 's largest retailer squarely in middle of a new phenomenon sometimes known as ' crowd - sourcing , ' or the ' sharing economy			1
' the company hopes the plan will help it compete with online rival @entity19 , which has expanded from an internet bookstore to practically corner the market in all online shopping			1
a @entity2 store in @entity24 , @entity25 : the company is mulling a radical plan to ' crowd - source ' its online deliveries by asking in - store customers to drop off packages to internet buyers on their way home such an effort would , however , face numerous legal , regulatory and privacy obstacles , and @entity2 executives have admitted it is still at an early planning stage			1
@entity2 is making a big push to ship online orders directly from stores , hoping to cut transport costs and gain an edge over @entity19 and other online retailers , which have no physical store locations			1
the company does this at 25 stores currently , but plans to double that to 50 this year and could expand the program to hundreds of stores in the future			1
@entity2 currently uses carriers like @entity55 for delivery - or , in the case of a same - day delivery service called @entity2 to go that is being tested in five metro areas , its own delivery trucks			2
' i see a path to where this is crowd - sourced , ' said @entity66 , chief executive of @entity2 in the @entity67 , in an interview with @entity69			2
@entity2 has millions of customers each week , some of whom could tell the retailer where they live and sign up to drop of packages for online customers who live on their route home , mr @entity66 explained			1
in return , @entity2 would offer a discount on the customers ' shopping bills , effectively covering the cost of their petrol in return for making the deliveries , he added			1
@entity2 : @entity2 currently uses carriers like @entity55 for delivery - or , in the case of a same - day delivery service called @entity2 to go that is being tested in five metro areas , its own delivery trucks ' this is at the brain - storming stage , but it 's possible in a year or two , ' said @entity91 , senior vice president of @entity2 @entity67 innovations			2
however , @entity93 , retail analyst at @entity94 , said the likelihood of the plan being broadly adopted across the @entity2 's network of more than 4,000 @entity67 stores is low			1
' i 'm sure it will be a test in some stores , ' he said			0
' but they may only keep it for metro markets and for higher - priced items			2
' start - ups such as @entity107 and @entity108 already let individuals rent out their time and expertise to companies and people looking for small jobs to be completed			2
zipments was founded in 2010 as a crowd - sourced delivery network that allowed anyone over 18 years old with a vehicle , a text - enabled phone , and a @entity121 account to bid on courier services for local businesses			2
such online match - making businesses often push legal boundaries - and a @entity2 crowd - sourced delivery program would be no different , according to mr @entity93			1
online packages delivered by customers may never reach their destination , either through theft or fraud , he said			1
such a crowd - sourced delivery service may not be as reliable as @entity55 or @entity134 , which have insured drivers , he added			0
' you are comfortable with a @entity55 or @entity134 truck in your driveway , but what about a stranger knocking on your door ? ' mr @entity93 said			0
the @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 : @entity2 hopes to gain an edge over internet rivals , which have no shops , by shipping goods sold online from its network of 4,000 stores across the @entity67 while @entity115 started out with a pure crowd - sourcing approach , the company now does more screening of drivers before allowing them to be part of its delivery network , chief executive and co-founder @entity159 said			1
theft , fraud and late deliveries have never been a problem , but insurance and licenses were an obstacle , @entity159 explained			0
drivers often need personal liability insurance to cover package delivery activities			0
cargo insurance is also needed			0
zipments self - insures this risk up to $ 250 , but the firm encourages its couriers to buy additional coverage for higher - value packages , mr @entity159 said			0
in some areas , like downtown @entity177 , people also need a courier license to deliver things , he added			0
' @entity115 now helps people get all these things set up before allowing them to deliver goods , ' mr @entity159 said			0
still , he said the issues are not insurmountable , citing pizza restaurants , which have used part - time drivers to deliver food for years			0
' it 's a great solution for large retailers like @entity2 , ' mr @entity159 said			0
' we 'd like to see them move quicker , but it 's great that they are considering it			0
' @entity115 is trying to provide such services to retailers , although mr @entity159 declined to say which companies the start - up is talking to about this .			0

company hopes the plan will help it out - compete online *giant* @entity19
however , such an effort would face legal and regulatory *barriers*
plan would offer customers cash off their bill in *exchange* for deliveries
analyst asks whether online buyers would be comfortable with it
