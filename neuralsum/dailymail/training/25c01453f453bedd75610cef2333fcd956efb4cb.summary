by @entity0 he 's guzzled blood direct from the veins of a cow , spent weeks enduring sub-zero temperatures and gone hunting in the desert equipped with nothing more than poison - tipped arrows			1
meet biologist turned explorer , @entity11 , 40 , from @entity12 : the star of @entity15 's new survival show , survive the @entity16 and a man not shy of getting in touch with his wild side			1
but unlike @entity22 , this is one tv survival expert who really does live the experience and says he 'd rather sleep in a palm - leaf shack than a luxury hotel			1
' the people i lived with on every episode showed me so , so much			1
' after living with these people , eating with them , helping them find and grow food , getting to know their children and sleeping every night under the same roof or stars ... the bonds you make with these people are indescribable			1
' if i did n’t show my real experience , it would be like lying to my family			2
unfortunately the camera is rarely there all the time but i certainly am			1
' @entity11 , whose first experience of tribal living came when he decamped to @entity65 aged 18 , has spent the last year living with a variety of different tribes , among them the @entity69 of @entity70 and @entity36 's @entity40 people			1
other tribes to feature on the new show include the hunter - gatherer @entity75 people of @entity65 , @entity79 's @entity78 population and @entity82 's @entity80 - many of whom still live traditional lifestyles , complete with igloos and reindeer			1
bleak : @entity11 also spent time with the @entity78 people of @entity79 who hunt using eagles remote : the @entity69 people of @entity70 live in the @entity90 and live on a mix of cattle blood and milk tasty : @entity11 gives water to some of the @entity69 people 's cattle during his stay in @entity70 but while going on shark catching expeditions with the @entity101 proved the most hazardous , it was the @entity69 's lifestyle that proved hardest to cope with - in no small part because of their blood and milk diet			1
' i lived on cow 's blood and milk for almost three weeks , ' remembers @entity113 , who in one scene , slurps blood direct from the animal 's vein			1
' there were n't any other options but that said , this diet is what has allowed the @entity69 to live in one of the driest and hottest places on @entity125			1
' despite the lack of alternatives , @entity11 admits that he did find the tribe 's ' blood milkshakes ' hard to stomach			1
' i never got used to drinking blood , ' he confesses			2
' mixing it with milk , which i like to call a blood smoothie , made it only a tiny bit better			1
' the one alternative he did get to try was goat , although according to the 40 - year - old , that was n't much nicer			2
' the @entity69 warriors and i killed a goat to eat and there was not an ounce of fat on that animal , ' he recounts			1
' i can remember eating the ribs as they were cooked over the fire			2
it was like eating chopsticks with a touch of dried meat paint that you scraped off with your teeth			2
' but when it was all said and done , there was nothing left of that goat			2
the next day , i discovered my host mother tanning the goat skin while children had made rattles out of the hooves and my host father had made clothing hooks out of the horns			2
i learned to not take food for granted			0
' memorable though his time with the @entity69 was , it was the @entity75 , the same @entity65 tribe with whom he lived as a teen , that he most enjoyed living with			1
' the @entity75 will always be a favorite of mine , ' he reveals			1
' they took me in as a teenager and their way of life made me question my own in so many ways			0
' they have such strong family and kinship bonds with one another within their communities			0
everyone takes care of each other			0
' terrifying : during his time with @entity65 's @entity75 people , @entity11 lived deep in the jungle remote : life for the @entity75 involves devising elaborate ways to trap birds and animals living in the forest what 's more , he adds , the @entity75 could give the @entity69 a run for their money when it comes to feats of physical endurance too			1
' seeing a 70 - year - old man climb 100 feet up a tree without branches and run through the swamps and jungles after wild game with spears , showed me what humans are capable of - even at old age , ' says an admiring @entity11			1
but not everyone grew up in a rainforest or in the beautiful @entity221 and as a result , says @entity113 , surviving in the wild should n't be taken lightly			0
' it comes down to experience , ' he explains			0
' inexperienced people do n’t see the hazards and they do n’t understand the priorities of keeping themselves alive			0
freezing : living with the @entity80 people of @entity82 proved challenging thanks to the extreme cold shark hunt : during his trip to the @entity101 , @entity11 hunted @entity235 sharks in a flimsy canoe ' you often hear stories of people that get lost , give up and die because they were trying to find a way to fix their mobile and they freeze to death despite having a lighter in their pocket			1
' if i had given up when i was lost in the rainforest with the @entity249 or when i was so dehydrated and over heated driving cattle up a mountain with the @entity69 or when i thought i was going to freeze to death in the @entity256 with the @entity80 - in real survival situations like that , those those that give up , die			1
' what some people see as survival skills , i look upon as my lifestyle , ' he continues			0
' i do n’t want the places i love to be spots that i have to fight to stay alive in and fight to get out of			0
' i want to learn all the ways to make these places useful so i can spend more time in them and even thrive there			2
' survive @entity16 starts on thursday 17th july at 9pm on @entity269 while you 're unlikely to run into too many difficulties in the wilds of @entity274 or @entity275 , should you find yourself marooned in the @entity276 or on @entity277 , these survival tips could save your life : learn from the locals ' the tribes are the ultimate experts in their terrain , whether it ’s jungle , desert , mountain or @entity256 ice			1
' survival knowledge is passed from generation to generation by word of mouth			0
every skill and secret is passed on by the tribal elders			0
theirs is a vital role and key to the tribe ’s continued survival			0
' @entity298 ' understanding the natural world is key to survival wherever you are			2
it can provide you with everything you need – food , water and shelter – and help keep you away from the plants and animals you want to avoid			0
' use sustainable solutions ' tribal survival is not just about now it ’s about the future			0
indigenous peoples are the masters at living in harmony with their environment , knowing when to harvest and when to leave in the ground ; when to catch a fish and when to throw one back			2
' survival is not just about the present generation , it ’s about all the generations to come			0
in the @entity101 , i caught a juvenile coconut crab but had to put him back			0
the @entity324 will only eat adults that have first had a chance to breed			0
' waste not , want not ' in tribal societies nothing is wasted			0
if an animal is killed , every piece of that creature is used – the meat for food , the leather for clothing , the bones and sinews to make tools and weapons			0
' they have little , but everything they have helps them survive			2
in @entity36 , the @entity40 make good use of the leg tendons of giraffes as they make great strings for their bows			0
' @entity348 ' even in desperate situations , keeping your survival instincts intact can save your life			0
i got lost in the depths of the @entity65 rainforest , but by keeping calm and using field skills , i found my way back to the tribe .			0
