@entity0 away from the history that is being made in @entity2 , a former @entity3 is living an entirely different life – one of service and devotion to @entity8			0
back then , she was @entity9 , a promising teenage speedskater making her @entity11 debut at the 1998 @entity13 games			1
now 32 , she 's @entity14 , in the @entity15 , driven by a calling that she first began to receive in @entity13			1
rising star : @entity9 looked like a promising athlete when she competed in the 1998 @entity20 as a 17 - year - old that 's where she realised that the life of an @entity11 champion may not be for her			1
@entity14 told @entity26 : ' i could n't see myself continuing all through my 20s and 30s like other athletes			0
' she added : ' i remember it vividly , one day practicing : i said [ to my mother ] , ' i just want to be in a play or a musical in school rather than this			2

' in a december 1997 interview with the @entity41 , @entity42 - who was 17 at the time - said she was ready to quit speedskating to pursue a career as an artist			2

at right , she 's pictured in the @entity48 at 17 years old that same year , she broke her own @entity50 record for the 3,000 meters three times , but was looking to leave it all behind			1

' we were real close and i always knew , ' said her mother			2
' she was getting more and more focused on her faith and i was happy for that			0
' looking back at her life now , @entity14 says she would n’t change anything			0
in a 2010 interview with @entity85 , she said : ' i do n’t miss any of those things , because life is so rich and so full			0
