@entity0 has squeezed in a lot between his two trips to @entity3 , which stands seven miles north of @entity4			1
his first visit was in 1999 , while he was on tour with @entity8 under 19s , and his second was earlier this week when he took time out ahead of his 100th test as captain of the @entity8			1
one @entity18 , three @entity13 awards and a legacy as one of the greatest rugby players of all time sit at the top of his cv			1
yet the iconic @entity21 7 still strives to better himself , pointing out on friday that there is room for improvement in the game against @entity27 on saturday			1
the 32 - year - old has spent more than two years of his life on tour with the @entity8 , but 1999 still holds vivid memories			1
‘ it was my first real trip outside @entity8 , ’ he said			1
‘ to go on tour with a @entity8 team was something i never dreamed of and to get the chance straight out of school was pretty cool			2
@entity62 was in that team ; it makes you feel a bit old ! ‘ a few of us had a look around @entity3 the other day , which we did back in ’ 99			2
that brought back a few memories of walking around with wide eyes			0
i never thought i ’d be coming back 15 years later with all the things that happened in between			0
’ @entity27 was where @entity0 first captained the @entity8 in 2004 , but also the scene of his worst defeat , a controversial 20 - 18 loss to @entity78 in the 2007 @entity18 quarter - final			1
the ghosts of that upset , which sparked national uproar back home , were laid to rest in 2011 , when @entity8 were crowned world champions in their own back yard , and head coach @entity86 puts that down to a change in mindset under their skipper			1
‘ in 2007 we had a team which should have won the @entity18 but we stuffed it up because we expected to win it , ’ said @entity86			1
‘ we had the players to do that but we did n’t have the mindset			0
you have got to go and earn the right to win it			0
i do n’t think we were hungry enough			0
‘ when you expect something to happen you sit back and wait for it to happen , but when you are really hungry for something you go and take it			0
mentally we have got stronger			0
’ they have created an unbreakable aura and that is what @entity27 must overcome on saturday			1
@entity40 ’s side have not beaten any of the @entity107 powerhouses since 2008 and their record against the @entity109 stands at 25 consecutive defeats — by an average margin of 24 points — since their last victory in 1953 , more than 25 years before any of the current team were even born			0
@entity0 and his team - mates have won three from three on their northern tour in the @entity119 internationals @entity8 perform their famous @entity120 in 2011 with @entity0 at the centre after winning the @entity18 @entity8 coach @entity86 ( left ) claims @entity0 is @entity8 's ' greatest ever rugby player ' @entity0 made his first performance as captain for his country against @entity27 in november 2004 so when asked if a shock result on saturday would top winning the @entity128 , it is little surprise that @entity131 ’s answer was ‘ absolutely ’			1
‘ for us to win would be the best days in our rugby careers , ’ said the @entity21 10			2
‘ it ’s been a long time since we beat the @entity8 and we have it in us to do it			2
hopefully we can create something special			0
‘ they may be the best rugby side ever			2
we will all have to come up with nine - out - of - 10 or 10 - out - of - 10 performances to get a result			0
anything below that from each of us is probably not going to be good enough			0
we have to turn up and push ourselves to demand excellence			0
’ that level of excellence is what @entity0 demands in training every day			2
if @entity27 are going to deny the @entity148 a happy 100th , then they will have to defend the @entity35 like @entity3 .			1

@entity0 will make his 100th test for @entity8 on saturday
the 32 - year - old first visited @entity3 in 1999 with the @entity153
he returned this week ahead of the @entity8 clash with @entity27
the @entity18 winner first captained @entity8 in @entity27 in 2004
@entity86 *branded* him as the country 's ' greatest ever rugby player '
