' come on , guys , ' he moaned over the team radio after he was informed he 'd missed out on pole			2
@entity6 was downcast , but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying			0
@entity2 set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. it was enough			2
@entity13 , though , got closer to @entity76 than he has recently , perhaps heeding the advice of @entity78 , his team chairman , who told him via @entity79 to ‘ sort himself out ’			1
@entity63 will be towards the back of the grid			2
@entity62 will start 17th and @entity64 18th			1
barely a hair ’s breadth separated the two former champions			0
a naturally disappointed @entity62 said : ' the car did n't feel bad so it 's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there			1
we 've made good improvements this weekend , but qualifying just was n't for us			0
' hopefully we 'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow , but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well			0
' @entity6 qualified third but could threaten @entity2 's supremacy with the @entity0 stronger than @entity14 over a long run @entity13 waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row , but the @entity17 was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position @entity2 's impressive lap on his first run on @entity105 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the @entity21 @entity6 starts ahead of @entity36 pair @entity34 and @entity37 , with @entity0 team - mate @entity39 down in sixth place as he struggled in @entity105 , with his best lap in @entity109			1
@entity110 's @entity40 was seventh quickest ahead of the @entity14 of @entity43 , with @entity46 pair @entity45 and @entity47 performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th			0
pastor @entity49 lines up 11th , missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second , with @entity51 a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his @entity110			0
@entity62 out - qualified @entity64 for the second consecutive race , but will only start 17th for @entity63 @entity64 starts 18th in @entity116 and will have the @entity118 cars of @entity65 and @entity67 for company at the back of the grid @entity55 rookies @entity53 and @entity56 start 13th and 14th , with @entity58 15th in a @entity60 that is off the pace as the team 's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until june			1
from the initial 18 - minute session , @entity60 's @entity61 led the list of departees , finishing three tenths of a second behind team - mate @entity58			1
for the first time this season @entity118 had both cars taking part in qualifying , with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule			0
@entity65 , forced to sit out qualifying and the races in @entity41 and @entity5 due to issues , finally enjoyed a one - lap session			0
the 23 - year - old @entity142 will start 19th , eight tenths of a second ahead of @entity67 , albeit three seconds behind @entity64 , underlining that whilst @entity118 are fighting , they still have a lot of work to do .			2

@entity2 claimed his third straight pole position of the season with a *scintillating* lap in @entity116
@entity13 was just *0.042secs* **slower** than his @entity14 team - mate
@entity17 said : ' oh , come on , guys , ' when told he was **slower** than @entity2 for third time this season
@entity6 will start third with @entity34 fourth *...* @entity37 and @entity39 complete third row
