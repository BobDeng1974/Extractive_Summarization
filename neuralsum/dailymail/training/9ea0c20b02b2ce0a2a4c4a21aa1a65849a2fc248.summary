shameless @entity0 , 57 , has been jailed after admitting lying about the size of the inheritance , when he received it , cheating the state out of £ 64,000 benefits - and even having the cheek to claim more while he was awaiting sentence			1
six months ago @entity0 pleaded guilty at @entity10 crown court to cheating benefits by not disclosing that his wife had a job			1
he told the court last november that his wife was about to inherit £ 40 - £ 50,000 and he would use that to repay most of the money he had obtained			1
going down : benefit fraudster @entity16 , 57 , has been jailed for nine months for cheating £ 64k in benefits and hiding £ 100k inheritance the total @entity0 obtained illegally was £ 64,375			1
but when @entity0 returned to court to be sentenced this week , judge @entity19 was told that not only has he failed to repay the money , he lied about the size of the inheritance - and the fact that his wife had already received it before the last hearing			1
@entity25 top it off he had the audacity to make inquiries about claiming more council benefits on the grounds that some of the inheritance has been put into investment bonds , making the capital untouchable			2
' oh dear , ' sighed judge @entity19 when prosecutor @entity34 told him what had happened since the last hearing			0
@entity0 ’s solicitor , @entity36 , admitted that he , too , was ‘ horrified ’ when he realised what his client had done			2
' he has put himself in something of a mess , ' conceded mr @entity36			0
jailing @entity0 for nine months , judge @entity41 told him : ' when you appeared before me in november you pleaded guilty to a series of offences committed over a considerable period of time			2
' there were a number of mitigating factors which i was asked to take into account and one was your poor health			0
' another was the fact that this was not an offence that started out as a crime but deteriorated into one when your wife took employment			0
' you pleaded guilty and it was said you , or your wife , were likely to inherit £ 40 - £ 50,000 and you would be able to repay the majority of the money you had defrauded from the state			1
' it now transpires that during the period while you were awaiting your appearance here you had commenced a further fraud , committed while on bail			0
' you sought to deliberately mislead this court and you pretended that you might be receiving some money , or your wife would , in the near future			2
' in fact by the time you appeared before the court you had already received the sum of £ 105,000			0
' you tell me today that you did n’t know your wife had received that money - i believe that is yet another lie to this court			1
' i am afraid any sympathy i had for you at the last hearing has now evaporated			0
' at the last hearing the court was told @entity0 had received income support for eight years by saying he and his wife were unemployed and he was on disability allowance			1
but since 2003 his wife had worked at a children 's nursery and the couple would not have been entitled to all the benefits they received			0
@entity0 pleaded guilty to obtaining benefits by deception but told the court , through his solicitor , that his wife would soon be inheriting about £ 50,000 and that could be used to repay most of the benefits			1
the court was also told that @entity0 was due to have a triple heart by - pass in the next few weeks as well as investigation for prostate problems			0
judge @entity41 then agreed to defer sentence on @entity0 until today to see if he can repay the outstanding money in that time			1
@entity0 left court with his wife after that hearing and crossed the road to a disabled parking space where he got into a 61 reg @entity107 vehicle and drove away			2
@entity109 are priced at between £ 16,500 and £ 27,000			0
@entity0 later insisted the car was not his but is provided for him as part of his disability care package			1
' it ’s leased through the mobility allowance			1
i do n’t own it - and that ’s @entity119 ’s honest truth , ' he said			0
' every three years , on september 14 , i get a new car and i get to choose which one i want , but i ca n’t do anything with it			0
' i can see how it would look damn disgusting , but if anybody walked around my house they could see i have n’t got any money			0
' living on handouts : @entity0 in his new 61 - reg @entity130 paid for by the state under mobility allowance today @entity0 admitted an additional offence of continuing to claim housing and council benefit from @entity136 without declaring the £ 105,000 bequest his wife had received			1
mr @entity34 told the court : ' shortly after the last court hearing here the investigations team received an anonymous phone call suggesting mr @entity0 had already received the inheritance and , indeed , had been away on holiday			1
' he had not declared the receipt of any capital to the council , probate had been granted last june and his wife had received payments of £ 1,000 on 15th april 2011 , £ 10,000 on 13th july , £ 85,000 on 29th september and £ 9,168 on 16th november			2
' it was money his wife already had when he last appeared before your honour			0
' not surprisingly , he was interviewed in january and he confirmed he was still receiving council benefits and that he had not told the council about the inheritance because it was his wife ’s money			2
' despite his wife having received the inheritance before the last hearing @entity0 had repaid only £ 261 so far , said mr @entity34			1
' he has even been back into the council and asked for benefits again on the basis that he now has less than £ 16,000 capital because he has invested a lot of the money in inheritance bonds , which means capital is not available to him , only income			1
' @entity36 told the court the couple have £ 60,000 in bonds but are willing to hand them over so that when they mature next year they can be used to repay the debt to the @entity175			0
' i am not sure he realised last year what a grave position he was in , ' said mr @entity36			0
' i am told he was not aware his wife had received that money			2
' ' i do n’t believe it ! ' retorted the judge			0
' if my wife received £ 105,000 from a relative i would be a little disappointed in her if she did n’t mention the fact			1
' after jailing @entity0 , the judge instituted a full @entity187 investigation into his affairs and warning him if he does not co-operate he could end up losing all his assets and being penniless .			0

@entity0 , 57 , claimed his wife failed to tell him she had received £ 100k inheritance
paid back just £ 261 of £ 64,000 he fraudulently claimed
claimed handouts while awaiting sentence because his money was tied up in bonds
still has *flash* car paid for by state as part of mobility allowance
