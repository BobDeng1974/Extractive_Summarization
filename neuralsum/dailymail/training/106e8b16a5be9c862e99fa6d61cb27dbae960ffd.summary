by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 22 november 2013 a man has appeared on this morning to tell of his horror after finding himself with a single b - cup breast			1
@entity4 , 28 , was left so distressed by the unwanted appendage , he attempted to slice it off himself after being denied surgery by the @entity8			1
the car parts salesman , who has since had it removed privately , told hosts @entity11 and @entity13 that he was left desperately unhappy after surgery was repeatedly refused			1
' it got rid it for two months but it started growing back			0
it was n't that hard when i was 18 but [ by the age of ] 25 , i really started suffering because i could n't have a relationship			1
' in the summer i would put two or three vests on and try to hide it with my hand			0
' @entity4 's condition , although rare , is not unique with around 400 men diagnosed with gynaecomastia each year			2
the condition , which is caused by a hormone imbalance , is more commonly found in the over- 50s but rarely manifests in such an extreme way			0
' it 's surprisingly common , particularly with men over 50 , ' added @entity44 's resident gp , dr @entity45			0
difficulties : @entity4 and his girlfriend @entity47 had to raise £ 3000 for a private operation after the @entity8 refused ' often it arises in adolescence and it can also be a complication of medication - 20 percent of those who get gynaecomastia , get it as side effect			1
' although the @entity8 will look at funding surgery for people suffering from similar conditions , @entity4 , despite his continuing distress , was repeatedly refused surgery			1
' most people do hide it , ' added dr @entity45 , ' but you ca n't underestimate the effect on people 's self - confidence and their relationships			1
' in @entity4 's case , his anger and upset eventually resulted in a dramatic attempt to cut the breast away himself			1
' i was very angry by the decision of the @entity8 and i could n't see any way out , ' he told the @entity77 newspaper			2
common : according to dr @entity45 , the condition tends to arise in men over the age of 50 healing : @entity4 's breast following the operation to remove it			1
he hopes it wo n't grow back ' i was too embarrassed to take my top off in front of my girlfriend so i tried to cut it away			2
' it was painful and there was blood all over the floor			0
but even then , the @entity8 could n't see how distressed i was			2
' girlfriend @entity93 , 30 , who appeared alongside him on this morning , added : ' he was really embarrassed and took a month before he would tell me what was wrong			0
' it did n't bother me but it did bother him and made him very self conscious			0
i went to his gp and they would n't do anything			0
' she decided to help him raise the £ 3000 it would cost to have the breast removed privately and last month , @entity4 finally went under the knife			1
' there 's nothing in there anymore , ' he reveals			0
' i was awake during the operation because i wanted to believe i was getting rid of it after two years [ of dealing with the trauma of it ]			0
' now the breast is gone , @entity4 says he finally feels happy again and says once the scar has properly healed , he will really start feeling ' like a man ' again			2
he added : ' i only hope it does n't come back			0

@entity4 first noticed the breast at the age of 18
by the age of 25 , it was a b - cup and was *wrecking* his self - confidence
the @entity8 refused to offer the car parts salesman surgery to remove it
became so distressed by the appendage , he tried to cut it off himself
now has had it removed after *saving* £ 3000 for a private operation
