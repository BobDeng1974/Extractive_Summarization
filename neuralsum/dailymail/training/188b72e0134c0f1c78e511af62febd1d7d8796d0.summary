main street retailer @entity0 has released a hilarious new holiday advert , which stars five pregnant dancers twerking and thrusting their bellies to a hip hop remix of festive favorite @entity5			1
the slightly bizarre ad , which was released on the company 's @entity8 page , showcases underwear brand @entity11 's range of cozy holiday loungewear and follows on from a last year 's @entity15 campaign , featuring six boxer - clad male models shaking their hips in time to @entity18			1
clearly eager to repeat the success of the viral video , which has received more than 18.3 million views on @entity8 , the retailer has taken the festive fun to a whole new level with this campaign , which shows each of the mothers - to - be showcasing some seriously impressive moves , emphasizing their big bellies with a series of twerks and thrusts			2
but just a few seconds into the campaign , the dancers turn into the spotlight and shake their rotund bellies at the camera , showing off their best hip hop moves , which , luckily , appear to have been unaffected by their pregnancies			0
the quirky concept was not without its complications however ; according to @entity61 , all of the women featured were in the last trimester of their pregnancy , in order to ensure they had appropriately large bellies			0
but with just a few weeks to go until each of their due dates , the retailer had to ensure it had back - ups waiting in the wings , in case one of the stars went into labor while on set			1
merry @entity79 ! the advert is the latest in a line of entertaining festive campaigns festive fun : each of the women is modeling a cozy pair of pajamas from underwear brand @entity11 surprise ! at the start of the ad , the women hide their pregnant bellies , before whipping round to reveal them since the advert was filmed last month , at least one of the women has given birth - and the rest are expected to go into labor before @entity79			2
to accompany the womenswear ad , which has already racked up more than 210,000 view since it was uploaded yesterday , @entity0 also debuted a menswear version last month , which features five male models using their stomachs as drums on which they bang out a festive carol			2
the retailer uploaded the menswear advert on november 17 and it has since been viewed by more than 1.1 million people , many of whom have been quick to congratulate the retailer on its unique advertising strategy			0
bang the drums : to accompany the womenswear campaign , @entity0 have also released a second @entity79 ad which showcases the brand 's menswear designs controversy at @entity79 : last year 's campaign , which featured six boxer - clad models , came under fire from some shoppers who claimed it was ' disgusting ' and ' sexist ' ' love the ad , and love @entity0 ! : ) always look forward to your holiday themed commercials , keep it up ! ' user @entity125 commented on the @entity130 video , while @entity131 added : ' i like this even better than last years ! ' last year , @entity0 faced criticism from some shoppers , who claimed the retailer 's @entity138 advert was sexist and distasteful			1
' you can forget me stepping into any of your stores			0
pull that ad off the air , ' one person wrote on the store 's @entity144 page , while another suggested : ' you should find someone to do better commercial writing			0

the expectant stars had to have back - ups waiting on - set in case they went into labor during filming
