by @entity0 , political correspondent last updated at 8:59 am on 2nd march 2012 ' historic step ' : @entity2 says the reforms ' will change lives for the better ' @entity2 today hailed an ' historic step ' in ending @entity7 's benefits culture as the government 's flagship @entity8 @entity11 finally became law			1
the prime minister said the measures to curb welfare dependency would help get people back to work and start to turn around the something - for - nothing culture encouraged by @entity20			1
the @entity21 cleared its final hurdle in the @entity23 last night despite bitter opposition from @entity20 and some @entity26 bishops			2
the legislation brings in a £ 26,000 - a - year cap on the total amount of benefits any family can claim and introduces new curbs to a number of long - term benefits			1
the prime minister said : ' today marks an historic step in the biggest welfare revolution in over 60 years			0
' these reforms will change lives for the better , giving people the help they need , while backing individual responsibility so that they can escape poverty , not be trapped in it			0
' past governments have talked about reform , while watching the benefits bill sky - rocket and generations languish on the dole and dependency			1
this government is delivering it			0
' our new law will mark the end of the culture that said a life on benefits was an acceptable alternative to work			1
' the prime minister paid tribute to work and pensions secretary @entity62 , who faced fierce criticism from charities and pressure groups to water down the legislation			1
he added : ' we 've stood up against the abuse that left taxpayers footing the bills for people on £ 30,000 or even £ 50,000 a year in benefits			1
' it 's a fair principle : a family out of work on benefits should n't be paid more than the average family in work			1
' this is a core part of the government 's task of turning around the legacy of debt , overspending and waste we inherited			0
' we want money to go to people who need it , not subsidising the consequences of our broken society			0
by reforming welfare we will get people into fulfilling jobs - not abandon them to poverty and dependency - save billions of pounds of taxpayers ' money and make sure those who really need help get it			0
' clampdown : more than 75 per cent of people of working age in the @entity102 area of @entity104 claim benefits the @entity11 had a stormy passage through the @entity23 , with peers inflicting seven defeats on the government when the legislation was first considered and a further one after mps had overturned all the setbacks			1
the most prominent came when the @entity113 @entity112 led a move to exempt child benefit from the £ 26,000 cap			0
@entity118 mp @entity117 today pointed out that the @entity26 pays its bishops ' chauffeurs significantly less than the £ 26,000 still on offer to some benefits claimants			2
mps were told that the @entity26 's 19 drivers are employed at a total cost of £ 352,719 - an average of £ 18,500			2
mr @entity117 said the clergy were morally obliged to pay their drivers at least as much as a household can receive in benefits			2
the @entity133 mp said : ' @entity134 has just become an @entity135			0
' those bishops who voted against this , who voted to ensure people who are not working should earn more than £ 26,000 , should now feel a moral imperative to pay their chauffeurs accordingly			0
' conservative @entity141 , representing the @entity142 , said being driven around ' helps ensure the best use of bishops ' time ' .			0
