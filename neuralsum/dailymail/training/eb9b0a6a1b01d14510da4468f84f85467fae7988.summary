by @entity0 published : 01:39 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 20 january 2013 some @entity3 2013 contestants have taken things literally as 21 snakes have now been bagged , with some being turned into actual bags			2
and belts and shoes and even pants			2
the first of its kind competition to see what brave hunter can wrangle the most @entity15 pythons kicked off january 12 and some fashion forward @entity17 will benefit along with the winner of the challenge			2
slithering slacks : one possible fate for the snakes caught during @entity23 is to become a pair of $ 1800 snakeskin pants @entity26 is a co-owner of @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 and he said the @entity3 is the perfect opportunity to repurpose his company 's expertise in harvesting , tanning and sewing alligator skins for handbags and other fine leather goods			1
' the snakes have become a problem because they 're invasive , ' @entity26 told @entity40			0
' it just seemed natural for us to go ahead and start buying the snakes from the hunters and utilizing them in our fashions			0
' here 's how it works : once hunters kill a python , usually with a gunshot to the brain , they turn the specimen over to officials at designated check stations where researchers gather biological information in the hopes of learning how to better combat the quickly reproducing nuisance species			1
interested hunters may then retrieve their snake and take it on over to @entity62 where @entity26 is paying premium prices for pythons			1
up to $ 150 each , though that 's only for the best specimens			1
tailored fit : a student from the @entity69 measures a dead @entity15 python caught by @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity29 as part of the month - long ' @entity3			1
' from there , the pythons are skinned and some are dyed while others are left with their natural brownish colors and then the skins are turned into high fashion			1
for instance , they might be made into snakeskin pants			0
and if the idea of pants made out of serpent does n't make you wince , the price tag might : these scaly slacks go for upwards of $ 1800 per pair			1
new threads : @entity26 of @entity28 , @entity29 's @entity27 usually works with alligator , but he 'll be making an exception during the @entity3 in addition to adding flair to the local look , @entity3 2013 exists to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem			2
while it 's unknown how many pythons live in the @entity103 , roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in @entity29 since 2000			2
eleven snakes were caught in the first three days of the contest			0
researchers say the large snakes menace native wildlife and believe native creatures like raccoons and opossum are fewer in number in areas the python is thought to live			0
prized pythons : @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity29 holds a dead @entity15 python he caught in the ' @entity3 ' @entity29 law prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets and they may only be legally transported if dead			1
hunters are restricted to four state wildlife management areas ; @entity126 is off - limits			0
they may use some firearms , as well as captive bolts and machetes to kill pythons			0
native species may not be taken			0
the state is offering cash prizes to whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons by the time the competition ends at midnight feb. 10 .			0

one @entity29 shop owner is buying specimens to turn into high fashion , paying upwards of $ 150 per snake
