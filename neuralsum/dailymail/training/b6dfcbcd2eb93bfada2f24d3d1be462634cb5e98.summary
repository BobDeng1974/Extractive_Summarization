a @entity1 sports car enthusiast is thought to have spent more than £ 6 million on a rare @entity2 in what could be a record price paid for a motor			1
the 240mph @entity2 is regarded as the @entity7 of high - performance motoring and is worth at least six times as much as a typical @entity10			1
it is the most desirable car of the past 40 years and , with just 64 ever built , it is also one of the hardest to buy			2
the @entity7 : a 240mph @entity2 has been snapped up by a @entity15 for £ 6 million the car is reputed to be the most desirable car of the past 40 years and , with just 64 ever built , it is also one of the hardest to buy but now an anonymous @entity15 - a self - described ' car nut ' - has joined the ranks after spending what is possibly a record - breaking estimated $ 10 million on the @entity23 - built motor			1
he joins an exclusive group of enthusiasts who own an @entity2 with @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 among a select few lucky enough to have a set of keys			1
@entity31 , the @entity32 , also owned an @entity2 with his bespoke car currently held in a family trust			1
this particular model , known as chassis 28 , was originally given to @entity38 racing driver @entity37 by @entity2			1
it is one of only two red @entity41 and it still has @entity37 's signature on the back of the sun visor			2
the racing driver held onto it for a couple of years before selling it to a @entity50 collector			2
it has since been owned by two @entity53 - based @entity2 fans			1
the amount spent is believed to be a record - breaking sum on the @entity23 - built motor @entity57 , vehicle acquisition consultant at @entity59 , spent six months trying to source a car for his buyer the @entity23 firm had hoped to build 300 @entity63 but there were n't enough wealthy fans at the time who were willing to spend more than half a million on a new car after spending the past ten years on the @entity70 of @entity38 , the car has now returned to @entity1 soil thanks to @entity73 - based @entity72			0
@entity57 , vehicle acquisition consultant at @entity59 , spent six months trying to source a car for his buyer			0
a car was found and an agreement was finalised last month with the red supercar now shipped over to the @entity1 as the world 's most expensive modern car			0
the price is thought to be around £ 6.2 million ( $ 10m )			0
in 2008 , a @entity2 sold for a then world record £ 2.53 million with the latest sale representing an increase of more than 1,000 per cent over its original retail price the value of @entity63 , unlike most modern cars , has continued to rise and over the past few years have gone through the roof the @entity2 remains the world 's fastest normally - aspirated car - a title it is unlikely to lose in the near future it achieved this price , in part , thanks to its breathtaking performance which comes courtesy of a 6.1 - litre @entity99 engine developing 627bhp			1
this gives the supercar , where the driver sits in the centre of three , a 0 - 62mph time of 3.2 seconds and a top speed of more than 240mph			2
despite being 20 years old , the @entity2 remains the world 's fastest normally - aspirated car - a title it is unlikely to lose in the near future			1
this latest model is the second @entity2 which mr @entity57 has sold in the past year , an impressive feat in its own right			1
he said : ' i think this is one of the most important @entity63 because it was built for @entity37 , one of @entity2 's race drivers and therefore seals the car 's close links with the company 's terrific motor racing heritage			1
' @entity63 are without doubt one of the most difficult cars to sell or buy			0
you have a lot of ‘ fantasy ' cars for sale so getting a genuine customer and genuine vendor is very hard			0
the car is one of only two red @entity41 and it still has @entity37 's signature on the back of the sun visor ' likewise for a buyer , finding a dealer who will be able to fulfil the task in hand is very hard indeed			0
' it took six months to find a car and get the deal in place and the new owner did not see the car before the transaction took place			0
i flew to @entity53 with 24 hours ' notice and the deal was completed just a few days later			0
' the @entity2 is the most significant road car since the @entity147			2
a lot of 250 gto owners also own an @entity2			1
' last year a model sold at auction for $ 8.5 million and the market has moved on since then			0
' @entity2 only built 64 road - going f1 cars and they were sold in the mid- 90s for a then staggering £ 540,000			2
the @entity23 firm had hoped to build 300 @entity63 but there were n't enough wealthy fans at the time who were willing to spend more than half a million on a new car			0
but their values , unlike most modern cars , have continued to rise and over the past few years have gone through the roof			0
in 2008 , a @entity2 sold for a then world record £ 2.53 million with the latest sale representing an increase of more than 1,000 per cent over its original retail price			2
