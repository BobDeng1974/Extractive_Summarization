when the rest of us are steering clear of danger , @entity0 is seeking it out to document some of the the most extreme weather @entity6 can throw at us			1
storm chaser @entity0 , from @entity8 , goes in search of tornadoes , supercells , lightning bolts and other natural phenomena throughout the @entity15 ' mid-west where extreme weather wreaks havoc			1
the 38 - year - old drives about 20,000 miles every year trying to find and shoot weather patterns that can rip up crops and blow houses away			1
these images , from lightning strikes in @entity25 's @entity24 to the supercell that produced a record volleyball - sized hail stone , are the incredible fruits of his labour			1
' seeing a supercell take on other worldly structures has its own way of amazing you , ' @entity0 says			2
' you ca n't believe you are seeing moisture take on such shapes and power			2
' @entity0 speaks matter - of - factly about the risks associated with his job as he recalling a moment when storms collided and lightning bombarded the town of @entity72 in @entity8 's north near the @entity25 state line			1
' at first it was n't that great to look at , but the lightning frequency was almost scary - it was probably averaging a bolt to the ground every second , ' he says of a supercell formed near the @entity81			1
' as it was crossing the interstate it began to look a bit more angry			0
then a huge nasty hail core bomb formed			0
it really looked like an upside down bomb went off over the interstate			0
it was just a white wall of hail and looked especially nasty on the radar too			0
a supercell merges with other storms to produce high winds and hail near @entity72 , @entity8 a menacing supercell circles over less green pastures in @entity8 , as captured by storm chasing photographer @entity0 tennis ball - sized hail and flooding rains came from this terrifying cloud cover in @entity103 , @entity104 the @entity105 says supercells are usually thunderstorms , but not always , that ' contain updrafts that rotate about a vertical axis '			1
this rotating updraft means they can ' overcome the self - limiting mechanisms that bring demise to regular storms '			0
destructive winds , huge hailstones and tornadoes can come from supercells			2
' most strong to violent tornadoes are associated with supercells , ' says the @entity105 ' as it entered the town of @entity72 it got cut off by a new storm firing right next to it			2
as i drove through town the most intense barrage of lightning bolts was peppering the town			1
it was especially frightening to the northeast side of town			0
' in a bid to get the perfect shot , @entity0 tests the limits of @entity6 to the point he is sometimes at her mercy			2
as was the case here			0
' it was n't scary until right after i took the picture of the two lightning bolts , ' he recalls			1
' i was trying to get those lightning shots knowing i was running out of time to bail south before that gust flung east over the highway			2
' i thought i had enough time to snap some and then zoom south really fast			0
but no , that thing came racing over the highway much faster than it had been doing all along			0
' suddenly i was in very strong outflow winds buried in rain and hardly able to stay on the road as the winds push me east			0
but the possible tornado could have been in there , so i did n't have much choice in slowing down			0
' a black ' summer supercell ' contrasts with the bright green field below in this 2014 shot taken in @entity160 mammatus clouds , formations that are seen beneath other clouds , and a curved lightning bolt decorate the pink and purple @entity8 sky a tornado that @entity0 says came ' from a tornadic supercell ' approaches in @entity169 , @entity8 , back in 2011 that 's not snow but enormous hail stones on the ground and plummeting down in the @entity81 of @entity25			1
