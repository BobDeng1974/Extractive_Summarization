by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 25 february 2013 two women had swabs left inside them after they gave birth at a maternity ' supercentre '			1
an investigation has been launched into the incidents at the @entity7 , @entity8 , between july and september last year			2
they both suffered health complications as the swabs became infected and had to be removed			1
not so ' super ' : two serious incidents at the maternity department of @entity7 ( pictured ) are being investigated both women had given birth at the @entity16 maternity department , which was chosen to be a " supercentre " in the @entity18 as part of making it better and has had Â£ 20 million invested in it over the past couple of years			2
both women gave birth naturally , and afterwards , staff used swabs - a common procedure in cases where there has been tearing of the skin			1
a swab can be a cotton wool bud or a piece of gauze used to clean a wound or to apply pressure			0
but in both cases , the swabs were left inside the women			1
they have been described as ' @entity40 ' , which means they should not take place if proper safety measures are implemented			1
some common medical tools used during childbirth a spokesperson for @entity46 , said : ' the two @entity40 reported in the january board relate to retained swabs after non-operative vaginal delivery where a non-operative invasive procedure was required to remove them and where there were complications to the patients arising from the swabs ' continued presence			1
' a @entity40 is defined as a serious , largely preventable patient safety incident that should not occur if the available measures have been implemented			2
' the @entity59 introduced this policy in 2009 following its proposal in ' @entity62 ' , and it is designed to promote transparency and accountability when serious patient safety incidents occur			0
' @entity66 is undertaking thorough investigations in to these events			0
' @entity69 , head of communications at @entity16 , added : ' i can confirm that we did have these two incidents last year			0
we take any such event seriously			0
' it would n't be appropriate to go into the details of these cases , however , thorough investigations of them were undertaken and the resulting detailed reports have been shared with the two women concerned			0
' the maternity unit at the @entity7 has approximately 6,600 births a year .			0
