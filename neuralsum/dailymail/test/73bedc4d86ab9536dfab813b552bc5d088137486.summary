a hoard of silver coins worth £ 34million that was sunk by the @entity3 on board a steamship has been salvaged by a @entity6 - led team at a record depth of 5,150m ( 17,000ft )			1
the @entity8 of @entity9 was travelling from @entity10 to @entity11 in 1942 when it was torpedoed by a u-boat 480 miles south of @entity13 , taking 100 tons of rupees with it to the bottom of the ocean			1
it was long assumed that the vessel 's cargo , belonging to the @entity20 , would be lost forever such was the complexity of the task facing salvage experts			1
treasure trove : some of the 100 tons of rupees found buried in the ocean floor at a record depth of 17,000ft after the cargo ship they were being transported on was sunk by a @entity31 submarine during @entity32 record find : some coins are raised to the surface during a pioneering recovery project by a @entity6 - led team hidden : the @entity8 of @entity9 was finally discovered ( above ) ' broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt ' underwater company @entity39 used powerful sonar to locate the vessel on the sea floor that was until a team led by @entity6 expert @entity45 used pioneering techniques to track down the ship with powerful sonar and robotics			1
underwater company @entity39 ( @entity50 ) , which included 20 @entity52 oceanographers , was then contracted by the @entity6 @entity53 to recover the coins from a record depth of 17,000ft - some 4,500ft deeper than the @entity56			1
a spokesman for @entity50 said : ' this was to be a difficult search as the water depth would exceed 5,000m , the weather , swell and currents were known to be challenging and the presumed site was some 1,000 miles from the nearest land in the foothills of the @entity67 ridge			1
' when the ship was finally discovered , it was ' broken in two and buried deep in the seafloor silt ' , adding that ' parts of the ship had metres of mud heaped upon it			2
' the @entity75 was sunk en route from @entity10 to @entity77 , via @entity78 and @entity79 in @entity80 the rupees , belonging to the @entity20 , were being transported from @entity77 to @entity11 when the ship sunk underwater company @entity39 , which included 20 @entity52 oceanographers , was contracted by the @entity6 @entity53 to recover the coins from a record depth of 17,000ft - 4,500ft deeper than the @entity56 keeping it under wraps : the recovery took place in 2013 , but has only now been made public the @entity8 of @entity9 was travelling from @entity10 to @entity11 , via @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity80 , when it was attacked by a @entity88 on november 6 , 1942			1
the @entity89 hit the vessel with one torpedo , but waited a further 20 minutes before firing the second			2
that crucial delay gave 296 of the ship 's 302 passengers and crew time to escape in lifeboats			2
famously , the @entity99 captain , @entity98 , approached the lifeboats and told the survivors : ' @entity102 , sorry for sinking you			0
' the victims were eventually rescued three weeks later , but 104 had died			0
@entity105 , one of the oceanographers on board the salvage ship , sv @entity109 , said the search submarine was successful on its first dive			0
' after two hours of underwater descent , the robot transmitted the first images of the wreck			0
it was incredible , ' she told @entity119 , as cited by the @entity120			0
the find was confirmed when the robot brought up coins stamped with the @entity124			0
but the team suffered ' serious ' problems trying to recover the bulk of the hoard because of the depths involved			2
the spokesman for @entity50 said : ' the team quickly found that operating at this depth caused serious technical difficulties which were new to us and which had to be resolved , quickly			1
' the combination of pressure , temperature , repeated dives at this depth and other issues resulted in multiple breakdowns of systems such as we had not experienced before when working in 3000m to 4000m depths			2
' the recovery took place in 2013 , but has only now been made public			0
@entity50 has left a plaque commemorating their find on the sea bed			0
@entity105 , one of the oceanographers on board the salvage ship , sv @entity109 , said the search submarine was successful on its first dive , adding : ' it was incredible '			0
