the images are said to detail the scene in sharper detail than the @entity134 pictures used in the original 1994 investigation causing police to review all evidence			2
however , authorities have stopped short of declaring a full re-opening of the case and police are reluctant to suggest much will come from the new photos			2
the nevermind star was discovered dead of an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound in his home near @entity145 by electrician @entity146 , who raised the alarm			0
the @entity71 chief medical examiner ruled that @entity5 , who was 27 at the time , had ended his own life after leaving a rehab facility for heroin addiction			1
authorities recovered a note , but speculation has been rife since that the @entity157 singer did not commit suicide			2
indeed , the 1998 documentary @entity159 by filmmaker @entity161 infamously made allusions to @entity5 's widow , @entity13			2
no evidence has ever been found that the @entity166 singer was in any way responsible for the rock icon 's death			1
loss : @entity5 was just 27 - years - old when he was found dead in his @entity71 home in 1994 from an apparently self - inflicted gun wound identification : on thursday , @entity71 police released two photos from the scene , including one showing an open wallet with @entity5 's @entity94 close up : they also released this image showing spoon in a box filled with syringes			1

detective @entity95 , a spokesperson for the @entity96 , told the @entity207 the pictures have a slight green tint because of deterioration but still reveal more than the original polaroids			0
@entity200 reported that the image of @entity5 's dead body will never be released			1
as @entity23 fans across the globe went wild with speculation that police were to officially reopen the investigation into his death , @entity71 police were quick to clarify the pictures and the status of the case			1
' despite an erroneous news report , we have not ' reopened ' the investigation into the suicide of @entity5 , ' the @entity96 tweeted from a verified account			2
the police went on to explain on @entity230 that the case was simply being reviewed in anticipation of the 20th anniversary of @entity5 's untimely death			1
suicide note : @entity5 did leave a suicide note , pictured , at the scene saying his daughter would be happier without him ' our detective reviewed the case file anticipating questions surrounding the closed @entity5 case as the 20 yr anniversary approaches , ' another tweet explained			1
detective @entity95 later told @entity247 : ' there was nothing earth - shattering in any of these images			0
' speaking to @entity200 on april 8 , 1994 , electrician @entity146 said that as he walked into the @entity23 legend 's home ' i noticed something on the floor and i thought it was a mannequin			2
' so i looked a little closer and geez , that 's a person			0
i looked a little closer and i could see blood and an ear and a weapon laying on his chest			0
' stunned , he said that he could recall seeing the suspected suicide note on top of soil in the home 's greenhouse			0
' i only read the bottom lines , ' he said ' the bottom two lines said , ' i love you , i love you ' to someone			0
' together : @entity5 is pictured with his wife @entity13 - whom fans have tried to implicate in his death - and their daughter @entity276 legends : this 1991 file photo shows the band @entity23 , from left , @entity281 , @entity282 , and @entity5			1
@entity23 will be inducted into the 2014 @entity283 on april 10 , 2014 , at the @entity284 in @entity285 two weeks before his suicide , a police report detailed how officers had been called to his @entity71 home after @entity5 had locked himself in his bathroom and threatened to kill himself			1
the report said that at the time , police were told ' he had a gun in the room			0
' however , @entity5 had told police he was not suicidal , but in the aftermath of his death they immediately ruled suicide			1
more than 7,000 mourners packed @entity299 two days later for a public memorial , where a recording was played of @entity302 reading @entity5 's suicide note			1
last year , a @entity71 police department spokeswoman said the department gets at least one request per week to reopen the investigation , mostly through @entity230			2
police have said no other @entity71 police case has received similar attention over two decades , reports @entity200			1
for confidential help , call the @entity312 at 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 or visit @entity313 / for confidential support on suicide matters call the @entity316 on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local @entity316 branch or visit @entity318 / almost 20 years to the day speculation still rages amongst @entity23 fans as to the circumstances surrounding @entity5 's death			1
his death certificate stated that he died as a result of a ' contact perforating shotgun wound to the head ' , and concluded it a suicide			0
however here are the leading theories that have grown up around his death homicide : lack of blood at the scene : @entity71 public access host @entity335 obtained a video taped from outside @entity5 's garage looking into his house			1
the scene around the body showed what @entity335 claimed was a distinct lack of blood for a point - blank shotgun blast to the head			0
toxicology report : the official pathology report determined that the level of heroin in @entity5 's bloodstream was 1.52 milligrams per liter - a potentially lethal dose			1
however , private investigator @entity352 - who worked for @entity13 - has pointed out that meant @entity5 could have been too high to even be able to pull the trigger			2
furthermore , @entity352 argues that the heroin was used to incapacitate @entity5 before the shotgun was fired by the perpetrator of the homicide			0
suicide note : @entity352 claims that while he was working for @entity13 he came across the suicide note that @entity5 wrote for @entity13			0
he believes that the letter reads as a note announcing he is leaving his wife and the music business - not as a farewell to life			0
he claims the final few lines at the bottom - which do imply suicide - were added afterwards by an unknown individual			0
the shotgun : the gun that the singer used to kill himself , a @entity374 11 20 gauge , was not checked for fingerprints until may 6 , 1994			0
according to the @entity378 , four cards of latent prints were lifted but contained no legible prints			0
@entity161 : the filmmaker 's controversial film , @entity382 and @entity13 made the claim that @entity13 paid for a hit on her husband 's life			0
however , in a 1998 interview , @entity161 said , ' i think that he committed suicide			0
i do n't think that there 's a smoking gun			0
' suicide : many of @entity5 's friends and family have noted the singer 's private and public utterances of depression and instability			1
they noted his struggles with addiction and what they believe was an undiagnosed bipolar disorder			0
they point to a previous suicide attempt in @entity408 in and bandmate 's @entity281 and @entity282 all believe he sadly took his own life .			0
