by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 10:59 est , 19 july 2012 a vicious family row over an £ 800,000 listed farmhouse was started when a retired academic invited his nephew 's family to live with him after his prized lawnmower was stolen , a court has heard			1
art historian , @entity9 ' @entity8 , lived with his wife @entity10 at @entity11 , a grade ii listed long house , in @entity13 , @entity14 , until he was widowed			2
but shaken by the theft of his @entity17 lawnmower after his wife 's death , he realised it was not good to be alone and invited his nephew , @entity21 , his partner , @entity22 , and their children to move down from their @entity26 home to look after him , in 2001			1
row : @entity21 , left , his partner , @entity22 , right , and their children to move down from their @entity26 home to look after @entity9 ' @entity8 in 2001 and claim he said they could have the house the couple set up home in the farmhouse ’s east wing , while mr @entity8 stayed in the west			1
but as dispute began when his nephew and his family were adamant that mr @entity8 had promised to leave them his home in return for uprooting themselves from @entity26			1
appeal : executors of mr @entity8 's estate , including his niece @entity47 and her husband @entity48 ( pictured ) claim the judge made the wrong decision but the pensioner , who died in his 90s in 2010 , claimed that the only deal he ever struck with the couple was that they could live in the house rent free if they contributed towards the bills			1
to the day he died , he insisted he would be entirely within his rights to throw them out			0
in august last year , judge @entity61 accepted the couple ’s plea and awarded them the whole of @entity11			2
however , three judges are now reviewing his judgement at the @entity68 after the executors of mr @entity8 's estate , including his niece @entity47 and her husband @entity48 , claim he was too generous to @entity21 and @entity71			2
@entity72 , representing the executors said there was no firm evidence that the pensioner had ever promised his home to the couple and , even if he had , the award of the entire property to them was ' an obviously disproportionate result '			2
the house made up the vast bulk of mr @entity8 ’s estate - valued in total at over £ 1million - and the judge ’s ruling meant that charities , to whom the pensioner had wanted to leave £ 650,000 , his great - granddaughter , @entity92 , and his niece and her husband all lost out			1
under his final will , signed in 2009 , mr @entity8 had left £ 650,000 - more than half his estate - to various charities			0
he directed that the rest of his his estate be split into 100 equal parts , with 55 of them going to his great granddaughter , ms @entity92 , 15 of them to @entity8 and mrs @entity47 and the remaining 30 to @entity21 and his wife - but only on condition that they moved out of the house within six months of his death			2
mower : mr @entity8 was left shaken by the theft of his @entity17 lawnmower ( file picture of a simliar lawnmower ) after his wife 's death so asked his nephew and his family to move into the house dispute : art historian , @entity9 ' @entity8 , lived with his wife @entity10 at the £ 800,000 @entity11 , ( pictured ) a grade ii listed long house , in @entity13 , @entity14 , until he was widowed mr @entity118 said the relationship between @entity120 and his nephew was ' not easy ' even before the widower decided to share his home			1
mr @entity8 had in the past ' bankrupted ' his nephew over an unrepaid loan and the evidence was that he regarded the younger man as ' a spendthrift , ostentatious and a risky proposition '			0
picture shows a self portrait with his wife by the late artist and academic @entity134 who died in 2010 mr @entity118 said trouble brewed in 2009 when the couple discovered mr @entity8 had no intention of leaving them the house			1
they went to court , claiming he had promised it to them , although he ' vehemently denied ' ever having done anything of the sort			0
mr @entity8 even sought a court injunction against the couple , seeking exclusive access for himself and his carers to guest rooms and the house ’s laundry room through his own front door			0
had mr @entity8 ’s will held sway , there would have been no inheritance tax liability on his estate			0
but mr @entity118 said @entity159 ’ ruling saddled the estate with a tax bill for almost £ 160,000			0
the @entity162 added that , when mr @entity8 was alive , he had been ' consistently cautious ' about giving any absolute assurances to the couple and he was adamant that he had never promised them @entity11			0
in august last year , judge @entity61 accepted @entity22 ’s account that she had only reluctantly agreed to abandon @entity26 for @entity14 and would never have done so had mr @entity8 not assured her that she and her husband would inherit the house			1
the couple had helped the old man empty his bins , get his car in and out of his garage and to put his laundry into the washing machine and , although that ' did not amount to a great deal ' , the judge said it sealed the ' bargain ' they had reached with mr @entity8			0
@entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 have now reserved their judgment on the executors ’ appeal .			0

@entity134 invited his nephew and his family to live with him after the theft in 2001
they claim he promised to leave them his farmhouse in return for them uprooting from @entity26
but @entity134 claims that was *n't* true and now a judge 's decision to grant the nephew the house is being appealed
