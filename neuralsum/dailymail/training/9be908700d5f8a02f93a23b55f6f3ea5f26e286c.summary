@entity5 researchers have revealed a hi - tech glove that lets people simply write in mid air			2
dubbed the ' airwriter ' , the system is able to work out what is being written simply by monitoring the position of the user 's hand			1
the airwriting glove can recognise letters drawn in mid air using sensors			1
its inventor claims it could one day even be woven into clothing so people can type anywhere the system could be combined with @entity25 to let owners of the wearable computer type in mid air - and the project recently won funding from the search giant acceleration sensors and gyroscopes are attached to the thin glove , and track the movement of the user 's hand			1
during writing , the airwriting system decodes the letters by a pattern recognition method			1
for every letter of the alphabet , a statistical model of the characteristic signal pattern is stored - this allows the system to spot letters and build up words easily , and learn a user 's writing style over time			1
its inventors say it could be used to enter text messages and write emails			2
' the airwriting glove is used to write letters into air , as if using an invisible board or pad , ' said doctoral student @entity58 , who developed the system at the @entity60 in @entity5			1
she believes the technology could eventually be woven into clothing so it can be used anywhere			0
' the interaction is embedded seamlessly in everyday life , ' she said			0
sensors attached to a glove record hand movements , then a computer system captures relevant signals and translates them into text			1
the sensors are also able to tell when a user is actually writing , rather than simply moving around normally			0
' all movements that are not similar to writing , such as cooking , doing laundry , waving to someone , are ignored			0
' the system runs in the background without interpreting every movement as computer input , ' says @entity58			0
the system can recognise complete sentences written in capital letters and presently has a vocabulary of 8,000 words			1
' the system has an error rate of 11 per cent , but when it is adapted to the individual writing style of the user , the error rate drops to three per cent , ' @entity58 says			0
to help develop the idea , @entity58 received the ' @entity94 ' , worth $ 81,000 , raising hopes it could be used with @entity94 's @entity25 wearer			2
the prototype glove is packed with sensors			0
however , it is believed future versions could be small enough to be simply woven into clothing ' when such a system is combined with the possibility to input commands and texts by gestures , you do not even need a hand - held device , ' she said			1
scientists are now working on further refining the method to filter out writing , and making the system smaller			0
' this can be achieved with commercial components			0
an unobtrusive wrist band might be feasible , for example , ' says @entity58 .			0

sensors allow the system to track hand movements , and work out what letters are being written
system could be used for computers and *mobile* phones to allow easy text entry
could be combined with systems such as @entity25 - and the project has recently won funding from the search giant
