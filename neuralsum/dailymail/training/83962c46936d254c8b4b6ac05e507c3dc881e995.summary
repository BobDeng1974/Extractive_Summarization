@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity4 ’s @entity3 are among his clients , moving clubs in the past two months alone in permanent transfers worth £ 208.5million			1
and that does not take into account the potential £ 51.3m final transfer involved in @entity13 striker @entity12 ’s move from @entity14 to @entity15			1
no wonder , the charming 48 - year - old @entity24 ‘ super agent ’ @entity16 , friend and adviser to footballing stars from @entity19 to @entity20 , has been hailed for ‘ winning ’ the transfer window			1
with a typical ‘ take ’ of 10 per cent commission per deal , he will have cleared some £ 20m - plus this summer , and £ 100m - plus in commissions alone in his career			1
but his earnings do not stop there			0
via his company @entity48 he also owns stakes in many players			0
@entity16 , married with five children , carries four mobile phones , is fluent in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , and also acts as a consultant to other agencies who own and trade in players			1
big deal : @entity16 has negotiated many transfers as such he represents what many fans see as the good , the bad and the ugly of modern football			1
he is , simultaneously , a key figure in a dynamic marketplace where you can rise on hard work and talent ; a major player in a parasitic industry where hangers - on prosper ; and a key figure in the often murky waters of vested interests where just a few people control many of the players and , arguably , the clubs			0
that is not to traduce @entity16			2
those who know him say he is engaging and provides good pastoral care			0
‘ he ’s with players for the long haul , not the quick buck , ’ says one associate			0
@entity19 says @entity16 is a ‘ fair and honest man ’ who he trusts ‘ completely ’			1
@entity20 said of him in 2010 : ‘ when i was told there was to be an award for the best agent in the world , i was immediately convinced that the award had to be @entity16			1
’ the @entity95 boss also says @entity16 encourages players to ‘ respect their commitments ’ to clubs			2
sir @entity100 says @entity16 is ‘ the best agent i dealt with , without a doubt ’			1
also not in any doubt is @entity16 ’s increasing influence			2
@entity48 ’s client list contains 58 names , two of them managers , @entity20 and @entity108 ’s @entity107 , the former goalkeeper known as @entity107			2
on target : @entity95 striker @entity2 , another @entity16 client , has already scored four @entity111 goals the best : @entity95 boss @entity20 was convinced @entity112 should be named the best agent in the world club : @entity116 age : 23 nationality : @entity13 position : midfielder total move value : £ 101.50m last move : £ 63m to @entity116 in 2014 @entity116 ’s @entity123 and @entity124 are also on the list , as are @entity15 ’s @entity126 and @entity127 , and @entity14 ’s @entity128 and @entity129			1
eighteen players are aged 23 or under , most of them in @entity24 and @entity54			1
spotting potential and following it through is a hallmark of @entity16 ’s business			2
he grew up in @entity134 , the son of a gas plant worker for @entity138 ’s biggest petrol company , @entity137			0
by 20 he was playing semi-professional football as a left winger			0
he ran a video store , then opened a bar and club in coastal town @entity144			0
there he met @entity107 , then 22 , and helped him move to @entity146			0
eighteen years later , @entity107 has been handed three young @entity16 clients on loan this summer in a loan intake that also includes ( @entity151 clients ) @entity152 and @entity153 , both from @entity155			1
by helping the young @entity107 , @entity16 was on his way , a fledgling agent at 30			2
he next helped midfielder @entity158 get his break , from lowly @entity160 to @entity14 , then took winger @entity161 from little @entity162 to @entity163			0
his contacts grew , as did his rivalry with the then dominant @entity24 agent @entity166			2
the pair had a scuffle over @entity169 in @entity134 airport in 2002			0
on the move : defender @entity3 joined @entity111 champions @entity4 this summer big reputation : @entity48 's client contains 58 names thanks to @entity16 ' increasing influence in the game meeting : @entity16 helped @entity108 manager @entity107 move to @entity146 when the boss was 22 club : @entity116 age : 29 nationality : @entity24 position : forward total move value : £ 92.24m last move : £ 80m to @entity116 in 2009 @entity16 did n’t land that client from @entity166 but he did bag @entity186 , @entity188 and @entity19			1
crucially , he charmed a client from another agent , @entity190 ; the client was @entity20 and the truly big time beckoned			2
by @entity193 , @entity16 was representing every major @entity24 footballer			1
he was agent to 16 of the 23 - man squad , and to @entity138 ’s manager @entity196 , who he then took to @entity95			2
in such a high - stakes environment it is inevitable @entity16 has upset people			2
he was accused of poaching @entity200 ( in 2007 ) and @entity201 ( in 2011 ) from their respective former agents @entity204 and @entity205 , just before those players made moves to @entity15			0
they said he pinched their players ; he said they wanted his help to make progress			0
@entity205 said of his muscling in on the @entity201 deal : ‘ when @entity16 arrived i was out of the transaction			0
it ’s a sad thing that the one who discovers a player is not able to stay with him when big clubs are interested			0
’ star names : @entity116 's deadly duo of @entity1 and @entity19 are also @entity16 clients club : @entity15 age : 26 nationality : @entity223 position : midfielder total move value : £ 89.08m last move : £ 59.7m to @entity15 in 2014 the @entity201 transfer also highlights another aspect of @entity16 ’s business — owning players			1
his firm @entity48 earned about £ 2.87m from the £ 7.4m @entity15 paid for @entity201 for their share of his ‘ economic rights ’			1
another of @entity16 ’s recent client moves took @entity54 striker @entity237 from @entity238 to @entity163 , with @entity163 paying £ 8.7m for 60 per cent of the player and the other shareholding an unspecified third party			1
another @entity16 client , 21 - year - old @entity24 midfielder @entity242 , on loan at @entity108 from @entity244 , is owned — entirely separately from his loan move — by @entity108 ’s @entity247 billionaire owner , @entity246			1
third - party ownership ( @entity249 ) is a regulatory minefield			0
in @entity53 it is prohibited by @entity253 rules and opposed by the @entity111 , whose spokesman said : ‘ it threatens the integrity of competitions , reduces the flow of transfer revenue contained within the game , and has the potential to exert external influences on players ’ transfer decisions			2
’ good move : @entity237 celebrates a goal with new @entity163 strike partner @entity267 club : @entity4 age : 23 nationality : @entity55 position : defender total move value : £ 42m last move : £ 42m to @entity4 in 2014 a report last year by auditors @entity277 said there were about 1,100 tpo footballers at work around @entity281 , in total worth about £ 1bn			1
sources say four — among them @entity3 — and perhaps more of the 100 - plus players coming to the @entity111 this summer were third - party owned — before the @entity53 clubs took 100 per cent ownership			1
@entity289 ’s @entity288 and @entity15 ’s @entity290 were among them			0
@entity95 ’s parent company , via a subsidiary firm , is believed to own a group of @entity249 players , but none in @entity53 , so no rules are broken			0
@entity16 has been linked to that fund as consultant			0
@entity16 did n’t own @entity3 , he is ‘ just ’ the player ’s agent and worked with several parties as @entity4 paid about £ 40m for the player			1
the £ 40m was split between @entity163 , an ‘ ownership fund ’ called @entity303 and another called @entity304 , with agency fees on top			0
no wonder @entity112 , pictured so often with his clients recently , is always smiling			0
all smiles : @entity16 poses with @entity12 and the @entity13 striker 's lawyers @entity309 and @entity312			0
