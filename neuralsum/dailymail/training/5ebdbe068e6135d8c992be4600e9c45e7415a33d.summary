if you ’re running low on fuel beware of filling up on the @entity2 because it charges drivers the ‘ consistently highest ’ motorway petrol prices in @entity6 , an exclusive new seven month study revealed			1
motorists on the @entity9 to the @entity10 of @entity11 in the @entity12 regularly face the most expensive unleaded costs , while those on the @entity15 in the @entity16 face the highest prices for diesel			1
details emerged in new investigation for the @entity21 by fuel experts @entity23 who tracked fuel prices at 133 motorway filling stations in the period from june until the end of december just as prices nationally were beginning to plummet			0
motorists on the @entity9 in the @entity12 regularly face the most expensive unleaded costs it reveals that motorists forced to play the m - way lottery could be paying up to 18p more per litre of unleaded – or around £ 9 per fill - up - on these most expensive motorways than on the cheapest ones			1
for diesel the gap can widen to 20p adding £ 10 to a fill - up			2
but compared to the average prices for unleaded fuel across the @entity6 , the difference can be up to 23p per litre – or £ 11.50 per fill up			2
drivers routinely pay up to 10p a litre more on average than off the motorway in a practice that ministers have condemned as ‘ a rip - off ’			2
by contrast , the best - value motorway outlets are on the @entity53 in the @entity16 of @entity54 and @entity55 in @entity56 , where prices are often less than the national average for unleaded and diesel			1
the detailed investigation follows the government ’s announcement of plans to force motorway filling stations to display their prices – and those of subsequent outlets – on giant roadside poles so motorists can choose whether to fill - up now or drive on to a cheaper outlet			2
the @entity23 report does not name individual outlets , but highlights the costliest motorways as a whole			0
it notes : ‘ every motorway with a service station was included , and the maximum and minimum price of standard unleaded and standard diesel was recorded , along with the price difference for these fuels between the most and least expensive outlets on each motorway			1
’ drivers on the @entity15 in the @entity16 face the highest prices for diesel , the study found the figures show that , of the 26 motorway - class roads with service stations , the most expensive average price for unleaded petrol was found on the @entity2 which snakes around @entity11 in the @entity12			1
it was the costliest in five of the seven months studied – with prices tracked at 142.4p per litre in june , 142.9p per litre in august , 146.9p in september , 134.9p in november and rising to 139.9p in december as prices nationally began to drop in line with falling oil prices			0
ironically three nearby independent harvest filling stations in the @entity11 and @entity104 area were the first to smash the £ 1 barrier by selling unleaded at 99p a litre			2
the most expensive spots were charging 18p per litre more for unleaded and 20p for diesel the @entity15 , which runs between @entity110 and @entity111 in the @entity16 , was costliest for petrol in two of the months tracked - 142.9p in july and 142.9 in november			1
: : @entity114 was also dearest on the same two motorways – the @entity15 in five months from june to october inclusive when the price was static at 151.9p , and the @entity2 in the two months of november at 139.9p and december at 141.9p			2
on thursday the most expensive unleaded on the @entity9 cost 130.9p at a time when the average price cross the @entity6 was 107.74p – a difference of 23.16p			0
the most expensive diesel on the @entity2 was 134.90 compared to a national average of 115.05p – a difference of 19.85p			1
: : at the other end of the scale , the cheapest average price for unleaded petrol in four of the months surveyed was on the @entity53 near @entity111 , @entity129 and @entity130 , and for the other three months on the @entity55 between @entity131 and @entity132			1
the @entity53 was cheapest for unleaded in july ( 130.9p per litre ) , october ( 126.9p ) , november ( 123.9p ) and december ( 119.9p ) the @entity55 was cheapest for unleaded in june ( 129.9p ) , and in august and september ( both 128.9p )			2
month june july august september october november december most expensive unleaded * @entity2 142.4p @entity15 142.9p @entity2 142.9p @entity2 146.9p @entity15 142.9p @entity2 134.9p @entity2 139.9 cheapest unleaded * @entity55 129.9p @entity53 130.9p @entity55 128.9p @entity55 128.9p @entity53 126.9p @entity53 123.9p @entity53 119.9p * based on average prices on each motorway for the month source : @entity140 diesel users found the best deals on the @entity53 in the five months of june ( 136.9p ) , july ( 135.9p ) , october ( 131.9p ) , november ( 128.9p ) , and december ( 125.9p ) , and on the @entity55 in the two months of august ( 133.9p ) and october ( 131.9p )			1
it concluded that overall the @entity53 and @entity55 motorways , as well as the @entity145 on @entity146 , were ‘ consistently among the cheapest motorways ’			0
the report said the biggest gap between the most expensive and cheapest petrol stretched to 18p in september – the difference between 146.9p on the expensive @entity9 and 128.9p on the cheaper @entity55			2
that can make the difference of £ 9 to fill up the average family car			0
the biggest gap between the most expensive and cheapest motorway diesel stretched to 20p in september and october – the difference between 131.9p on the cheapest @entity53 and 151.9p on the dearest @entity15			1
the report notes : ‘ the fact that one of the dearest ( @entity15 ) and cheapest ( @entity53 ) motorways are linked suggests the location of a motorway is not the reason for price differences			1
and , of the least expensive motorways , one ( @entity53 ) is in @entity54 while the other ( @entity55 ) links @entity131 and @entity132			2
’ the best value motorway outlets were found on the @entity53 through @entity167 and the @entity55 in @entity56 the biggest price difference between the most and least expensive outlets on an individual motorway was 14p for unleaded on the @entity172			1
that was followed by 12p a litre for unleaded , found on both the @entity176 and @entity177 motorways			0
for diesel , the biggest difference between the most and least expensive outlets on an individual motorway was 13p per litre , also on the @entity176 and @entity177			1
the differences mean drivers could save £ 6.00 on a single tank of unleaded and £ 6.50 on a tank of diesel leading to savings of hundreds of pounds a year			0
@entity188 of @entity23 which tracks prices at more than 10,000 @entity6 filling stations said : ‘ there is clear evidence of motorway service stations exploiting the convenience factor for motorists			0
most drivers fill up because they have to and may not realise there is cheaper fuel close by off the motorway			0
‘ what these figures show is that , even if you do buy your fuel on a motorway , you can save a small fortune simply by taking a few seconds to check where the best deals are			0
if you do n’t seek out the best prices , you could be giving hundreds of pounds away needlessly every year			0
’ @entity212 fuel spokesman @entity210 said : ‘ it ’s no wonder that motorists feel held to ransom with prices on the motorways inflated to such an extent			0
’ the @entity21 photographed an @entity220 filling station on the @entity2 at @entity222 services selling unleaded at 130.9p a litre and diesel at 132.9p			1
some 30 miles to the @entity225 on the @entity9 , the @entity227 service area at @entity228 near @entity229 was selling @entity231 unleaded at 118.9p , some 12p cheaper			0
diesel there was retailing at 125.9p , some 7p cheaper			0
the average price across the @entity6 , according to @entity235 was 107.46p for unleaded and 114.81 for diesel			0

it was selling diesel at 18.09 more than the average @entity6 price , adding just over £ 9 to each fill up			0
the @entity249 begins work early next year trialling a new fuel - comparison sign at five service stations on the @entity172 between @entity253 and @entity254 , with a view to introducing them nationally by the end of 2015			0
