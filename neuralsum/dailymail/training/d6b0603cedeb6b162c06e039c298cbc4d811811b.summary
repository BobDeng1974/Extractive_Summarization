a mystery structure being built on a barge floating off @entity3 's @entity2 is fueling speculation that @entity5 is turning its idea of a floating data center into a reality			1
while the internet company wo n't confirm the development , @entity9 reports it has evidence suggesting the four - story ' secret project ' could be a @entity5 sea - faring data center			1
@entity5 patented a ' water - based data center ' in 2009 , describing an environmentally friendly , sea - powered telecommunications and storage system			1
' secret project ' : while @entity5 wo n't comment , experts say this four - story construction in @entity22 looks like a data center is this is ? a 2009 patent filed by @entity5 shows a water - borne data center possible : this large structure on a barge just off @entity2 , between @entity3 and @entity28 , could be a floating data center being made by @entity5 ' a system includes a floating platform - mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units , a sea - based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units , and one or more sea - water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units , ' @entity5 wrote in the patent			1
now , @entity9 investigative reporter @entity43 claims the mystery construction site floating in @entity22 could belong to @entity5 , drawing on evidence from lease agreements , expert consultations and interviews with locals			2
he said putting data centers inside shipping containers , as he claims @entity5 is doing , is already a well - established practice			0
' the cutouts in the long walls of the containers , when they line up , they make hallways , ' said @entity59 , who designs similar structures			0
' you could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers ... it does n't have enough windows for an office building ' while some commentators have criticized the reporter 's evidence as circumstantial , experts say it 's plausible that @entity5 would build water - based data facility			1
@entity59 , the principal at @entity75 , which designs custom cargo container buildings , said the structure looks like a data center			2
' the cutouts in the long walls of the containers , when they line up , they make hallways , ' @entity59 told @entity9			0
' you could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers ... it does n't have enough windows for an office building			0
' @entity59 said that putting a data center on a barge would provide access to abundant water to help cool a large number of servers			2
@entity94 , a @entity95 research fellow and expert on data centers , said companies such as @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 have been installing specially built data centers in shipping containers for some time because they 're easy to deploy			0
this is an aerial view of the ' secret project ' in @entity22 this is @entity108 3 on @entity2 , alongside @entity109 , as seen in @entity110 , before construction began plans ? sources say @entity5 hopes to tow the completed structure from @entity2 across the @entity22 to @entity3 ¿ s @entity115 , where it would be anchored and open to the public meanwhile , @entity118 5 reports that @entity5 is actually building a floating marketing center at @entity108 for @entity120 , the cutting - edge wearable computer the company has under development			1
@entity118 5 claims sources say @entity5 hopes to tow the completed structure from @entity2 across the @entity22 to @entity3 ’s @entity115 , where it would be anchored and open to the public			0
the media outlet also reported that construction on the site , near the @entity128 , stopped several weeks ago because @entity5 does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront			0
construction on the site commenced last year , and the work is being shielded by a high security fence			0
another theory is that @entity5 is building a floating marketing center at for @entity120 , the cutting - edge wearable computer the company has under			1

experts speculate that @entity5 is building a floating data center on a barge in @entity22
@entity5 patented the idea in 2009 , but has n't commented on the development
others theorize the internet company is building a floating marketing center for @entity120
