several mysterious booms have shaken central @entity1 , rattling windows and spooking livestock , and officials say they do n't yet have answers for what is causing the deafening noises			1
@entity1 geological survey research seismologist @entity8 said a series of booms , much like a sonic boom , rattled the @entity13 area starting at 11:19 a.m. friday			1
similar booms had been reported thursday in the same area , along with other surrounding towns , though friday 's booms were n't ' quite as frequent ' as thursday 's , according to @entity8			1
' we thought some nut was out here , you know , with explosives , ' @entity25 told @entity33			0
' it sounded like thunder , you could feel the ground shake , but it was nothing like an earthquake , ' @entity25 said			2
@entity42 officials said two earthquakes struck the area on friday , a half - hour before the booms began , though they said the booms were not likely aftershocks , according to @entity33			1
both @entity8 and @entity49 meteorologist @entity48 did n't have an explanation for the booms			2
@entity8 said it 's unlikely that it 's due to a drilling process known as fracking because the booms were heard and felt over a wide area including @entity13 , @entity58 and @entity59			2
day , who 's based in @entity13 , said a phenomenon known as cryoseisms also is n't likely			0
@entity63 , or ' frost quakes , ' occur when water quickly freezes in soil or rock , then expands and cracks			1
rattled : the windows of @entity13 resident @entity25 's home rattled friday , causing him to think at first that it was some ' nut ' with explosives ' there are some stories going around that 's what it was , but based on the research we 've done here , it does n't appear what people heard is related to the cryoseism phenomena , ' day told the @entity85			1
' there 's not enough moisture , and the temperatures are not cold enough			0
that happens in areas where you have a lot of water flowing through a lot of rock , ' @entity48 said			0
' we do n't know what it was , we just know what it is not , ' according to day			0
@entity8 said the booms occurred on generally regular interval , initially occurring 40 to 60 seconds apart , then about 20 seconds apart			2
' it 's a mystery to us as well , ' he said			0
' it 's quite interesting			0

earthquakes occurred about a half - hour before loud booms rattled @entity1 friday , though officials say the booms are not likely aftershocks
seismologists ruled out *problems* related to fracking and frost quakes , which crack rocks and earth when moisture freezes in the ground and expands
