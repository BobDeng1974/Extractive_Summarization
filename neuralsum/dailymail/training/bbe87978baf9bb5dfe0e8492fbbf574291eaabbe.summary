rapist : more than 145,000 have signed a petition opposing @entity2 resuming his playing career signatures have flooded in on a petition calling for @entity2 to be stopped from playing football for his former club following @entity9 ’s controversial comments about his conviction			1
at the weekend the online campaign had attracted 90,000 supporters			2
but by last night , more than 145,000 had put their names to it			0
the petition , set up by feminist campaigner @entity16 , calls on @entity17 , chairman of @entity18 , where @entity2 played until he was jailed , to ‘ refuse to reinstate @entity2 as a player ’			1
it argues : ‘ to even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist			0
’ however , the club ’s manager @entity29 yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow – something many fans strongly support			0
‘ we ’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it , ’ he told @entity37			0
rather than sack @entity2 when he was jailed , @entity18 instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012			2
@entity45 chairman @entity44 said last week that @entity2 should be allowed to continue his career on his release			1
but former sports minister @entity48 , a lifelong @entity18 fan , told the @entity49 that @entity2 should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal , adding : ‘ people should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong			1
’ at the time , @entity2 was a 22 - year - old @entity56 international striker with @entity18			2
great things had been predicted of him when he was playing in the youth ranks at @entity59 @entity2 still maintains his innocence , and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted			1
among material it makes public is @entity71 footage showing the 19 - year - old , her face obscured , arriving at the hotel shortly before the rape took place in may 2011			0
it is accompanied by a commentary alleging that the footage clashes with her version of events – including her ability to walk in high - heeled shoes despite saying she had been too drunk to remember what happened .			0
