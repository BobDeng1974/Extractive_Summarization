by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 07:26 est , 14 december 2012 mobile phone apps which allow wives and husbands to spy on their spouses by monitoring their whereabouts as well as their calls and text messages will be banned under a new law to be put before congress			1
software companies are currently able to sell so - called cyberstalking apps that operate secretly on cellphones thanks to a loophole in current laws			1
apps such @entity16 's @entity17 or @entity18 , which sell for around $ 50 online , have become increasingly popular among jealous wives or husbands , but there are concerns they could be encouraging stalking and domestic violence			1
@entity26 : mobile phone apps such as @entity17 allow users to monitor their partners ' whereabouts and mobile phone communications after being installed on a person 's phone , @entity18 works by automatically emailing details of their activities to the worried partner			1
' suspect your spouse is cheating ? ' the company 's website says			2
' do n't break the bank by hiring a private investigator			0
' their website proudly describes how the app ' silently records everything including full sms messages , call info , gps locations , web sites visited , contacts added and more '			1
but yesterday , the @entity53 approved a bill that makes it a crime for companies to make and intentionally operate a stalking app. the legislation , sponsored by sen. @entity59 , @entity60 , also would curb the appeal for such inexpensive and easy - to - use programs by requiring companies to disclose their existence on a target 's phone			1
stalking and wiretapping already are illegal , but there are no provisions in federal law that clearly prohibit businesses from making an app whose primary purpose is to help one person stalk another			2
sen. @entity59 's proposal would extend the criminal and civil liabilities for the improper use of the apps to include the software companies that sell them			1
the proposal would update laws passed years before wireless technology revolutionized communications			0
telephone companies currently are barred from disclosing to businesses the locations of people who make traditional phone calls			1
but there 's no such prohibition when communicating over the @entity95			0
if a mobile device sends an email , links to a website or launches an app , the precise location of the phone can be passed to advertisers , marketers and others without the user 's permission			0
' what 's most troubling is this : our law is not protecting location information , ' said sen. @entity59 , chairman of the @entity53 subcommittee on privacy , technology and the law			1
an emailed statement from @entity16 said the program is for the lawful monitoring of a cellphone that the purchaser of the software owns and has a right to monitor			2
' if there is evidence the customer does n't own the phone , the account is closed , the company said			0
the program is not intended or marketed for malicious purposes and does n't facilitate stalking , the statement said			2
the spy apps are also marketed as a way for concerned parents to monitor their children 's mobile phones but @entity59 and supporters of his bill said there is no way to ensure the rules are followed			1
these programs can be installed in moments , perhaps while the cellphone 's actual owner is sleeping or in the shower			0
the apps operate invisibly to the cellphone 's user			2
they can silently record text messages , call logs , physical locations and visits to websites			1
all the information is relayed to an email address chosen by the installer			0
even when people discover the software on their phones , they do n't know what to do , said @entity164 , a @entity165 professor who specializes in mobile security and forensics			2
' law enforcement usually wo n't help them because they 've got bigger fish to fry , ' he said			0
@entity59 's bill is a common - sense step to curb stalking and domestic violence by taking away a tool that gives one person power over another , victims advocacy groups said			1
senator @entity59 chaired the @entity53 which has approved a bill making it a crime for companies to make stalking apps ' it 's really , really troubling that an industry would see an opportunity to make money off of strengthening someone 's opportunity to control and threaten another individual , ' said @entity190 , executive director of the @entity191			1
@entity59 's bill would make companies subject to civil liability if they fail to secure permission before obtaining location information from a person 's cellphone and sharing it with anyone else			2
they also would be liable if they fail to tell a user no later than seven days after the service begins that the program is running on their phone			0
companies would face a criminal penalty if they knowingly operate an app with the intent to facilitate stalking			1
the bill includes an exception to the permission requirement for parents who want to place tracking software on the cellphones of minor children without them being aware it is there			2
a domestic violence case in @entity221 , @entity222 , helped persuade @entity59 to introduce his bill			1
a woman had entered a county building to meet with her advocate when she received a text message from her abuser asking her why she was there , according to congressional testimony delivered last year by the @entity231			0
frightened , she and her advocate went to the local courthouse to file for a protective order			0
she got another text demanding to know why she was at the courthouse			0
they later determined her abuser was tracing her movements with an app that had been placed on her cellphone			0
the woman was not identified by name in the congressional testimony			0
@entity59 said that while doing research for the bill , he heard similar stories from women in @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and several other states			0
an organization representing software companies opposes @entity59 's bill because it said the user consent requirement would curb innovation in the private sector without adequately addressing the problem of cyberstalking			1
voluntary but enforceable codes of conduct for the industry are more effective methods for increasing transparency and consumer confidence , said @entity264 , senior director for public policy at the @entity266			0
those concerns resonated with the @entity53 's top @entity268 and one of its senior @entity270			2
the bill could have unintended consequences for an industry that is growing and creating new jobs , said sens. @entity275 , @entity276 , and @entity277 , @entity278 both senators voted for the bill , however .			0

secret apps record texts , calls , photos and gps locations before emailing details to the concerned party
but *opponents* claim they can easily be abused and could encourage stalking and domestic violence
@entity293 approved by a @entity53 would close legal loophole allowing companies to manufacture the software
