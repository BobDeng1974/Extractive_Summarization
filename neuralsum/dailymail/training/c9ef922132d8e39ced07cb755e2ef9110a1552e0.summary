senator for @entity2 @entity1 has opened up about her life before she became a politician , saying she fought off drug and alcohol abuse and an attempt to kill herself			1
the straightshooter , as described by @entity10 boss @entity9 , was born and bred in @entity11 , @entity2 where there was little employment and growth			2
' i was n't born with a silver spoon in our mouths , and we 've had to live that diversity and it has n't been fun and it has n't been handed to us on a silver platter , ' she told @entity24 story			0
when she was at her rock bottom son @entity32 ( far right ) had to be a carer for his mum before he too started taking drugs at 13 the daughter of a truck - driver father and factory shift - worker mother , @entity1 spent her teenage years in public housing and did not complete high school , instead enlisting in the armed forces			1
she became a driver before moving into the military police , and while she enjoyed most of her experience serving her country , it was soured by officers who wanted her gone			0
' 90 % of those military police men are great but the other 10 % , some of those men in there are nothing less than a pack of a * * * holes , ' she said ' they do n't want females in there and they 're guna do everything that they possibly can to break them and they were n't breaking me , they were just not going to break me			0
' @entity1 ( pictured left ) was in the armed forces for almost 10 years			2
she was discharged after suffered a painful back injury but that began her spiral downwards when her compensation payments were cut off ' 90 % of those military police men are great but the other 10 % , some of those men in there are nothing less than a pack of arseholes , ' said @entity1 ( pictured as a youngster ) she told @entity24 story how hard it was for females in the military police and how they tried to break her ms @entity1 ( right ) with her son @entity32 ( left ) at home			1
at seven he was forced to be a carer for his mum after she was discharged from the armed forces with a back injury and turned to drugs and alcohol			1
but he too , at the age of 13 , turned to drugs almost ten years in the job was when ms @entity1 suffered a dibilitating injury			1
in 1997 , on a training exercise , she hurt her back after being forced to carry a significant amount of weight			2
within two months she was medically discharged			0
the now senator lodged compensation claims with the department of veteran affairs and after some time she received payments			0
' i think i was on the books for about four months and they decided i was maligned and they had video surveillance done on me , ' she told @entity24 story			0
that surveillance was used to discredit ms @entity1 and her entitlements were terminated and she was forced to go on a disability pension			1
that was when her life started spiraling out of control , using alcohol and drugs to null the pain			2
from abusing drugs and alcohol to becoming a senator			2
@entity1 ( pictured left ) with @entity10 boss @entity9 ( pictured right ) the moment she realised she wanted to be a politician : @entity1 in parliament			1
after the @entity11 girl was hit by a car and got the psychological help she needed its then she knew she wanted to make a difference ' i got worse and then the psychological side of it started to set in , depression basically and then eventually over five or six years that it went into alcohol abuse , pharmaceutical abuse			1
at seven , her youngest son @entity32 , was forced to become his mum 's carer			1
' she just shut off really , just closed off from the world , obviously she had no money , she was n't working , she was sore all the time , she did n't want to go anywhere , just moped around home , ' @entity32 said			0
but by the time he was 13 he too , was taking drugs and @entity1 's world started to fall apart even more and that also increased her bitterness towards the armed forces , who had left her high and dry after serving her country			1
' they say thanks for doing service to your country , good one ...			0
. so and then we go and fight a bureaucratic system and we watch our families fall apart and we watch our lives in front of us fall apart because rather than help us they 'd like to make our lives miserable , ' she said			0
while in 2006 some assistance for her injury returned , it was n't enough and in 2009 her life changed forever , but not before she hit rock bottom			0
she continued to abuse drugs and alcohol , she put on weight and the pain from her injury took its toll			2
just before becoming a politician @entity1 ( pictured ) speaks to the people of @entity2 described as a straightshooter by @entity10 boss @entity9 , @entity1 ( pictured ) is making waves in the world of politics ' i 'd written a letter to both the boys and left them in my draw and said right here 's a perfect opportunity , i had a few drinks and off i went			1
' ' i 'd walked out in front of a car , i 'd had enough , i 'd had a gutful , that was it , i was finished , i was gone			0
' ms @entity1 sustained the loss of her two front teeth , a substantial scar to her forehead and a large hematoma to her thigh after she was hit by a car			1
but it was after she was hospitalised for a long period of time , she got the psychological help she needed before things in her life started to turn around			2
that was then , the beginning of her rise to becoming a politician , and her chance to make a difference and help those that needed a voice			0
' if i 'm going to get back at these people , and about to help others , then i could do this through politics , ' she said .			0
