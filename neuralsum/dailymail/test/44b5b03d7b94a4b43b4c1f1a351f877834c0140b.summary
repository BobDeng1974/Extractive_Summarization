@entity1 founder @entity0 has unveiled a ' revolutionary ' $ 3,000 battery which he claims can run an entire home for eight hours			1
@entity0 introduced the @entity5 device at a press conference in @entity7 last night and said the technology could ' change the world '			1
the device , which could be in homes by the end of summer , will be able to store electricity at night when it is cheaper			1
@entity5 is three feet wide and four feet tall , weighs 220lbs , and can be installed on an outside or inside wall			2
the left images shows the @entity22 version while on the right is the @entity25 device the technology powers up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper			1
users can then switch the battery on during the day to use the home during the day			0
@entity5 can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency , or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources			1
the ' daily use ' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt - hours , which is around a quarter of a home 's daily usage			1
the average @entity42 home uses 10,908 kilowatt - hours of energy per year , or just short of 30 per day			1
home battery packs could disrupt the utility market			0
in 2013 , the @entity46 , the trade group for investor - owned electric companies , issued a report warning about disruption			0
' one can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent , ' the report said			0
it would then discharge this cheap electricity during the day in quantities large enough to be useful to homes and businesses			0
the @entity5 is around three feet wide and four feet tall , weighs 220lbs , and can be installed either on an outside or inside wall of a home			2
the ' daily use ' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt - hours , which is around a quarter of a home 's daily usage			1
@entity66 figures state that the average @entity42 home uses 10,908 kilowatt - hours of energy per year , or just short of 30 per day			1
according to that figure , a single , fully - charged @entity5 device would be able to meet a quarter of a home 's energy needs on any given day			1
however , it would likely last far less time than eight hours during the mornings and evenings , when homes use the vast majority of their electricity			2
@entity0 said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy			1
the system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home , rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced , then buy it again during peak times			1
it could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies ' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper , stored energy during peak periods			1
according to tech site @entity100 , @entity0 told attendees at the event : ' our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy			1
pictured is a utility - scale version of @entity5 that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power the ' daily use ' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt - hours , which is around a quarter of a home 's daily usage @entity1 also unveiled the ' @entity118 ' , which is the big brother of the @entity5			1
it describes it as an ' infinitely scalable system ' that can work for businesses , in industrial applications , and public utility companies			1
it comes in 100 kwh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kwh all the way up to 10 mwh			0
' our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale , ' it said			0
' it sounds crazy , but we want to change the entire energy infrastructure of the world to zero carbon			0
' as well as the daily - use model , @entity1 will also launch a 10 kilowatt - hour backup battery , designed to tide homes over during power blackouts , such as those caused by storms			1
marketing material for the device , published late thursday on @entity1 's website , says : ' @entity5 is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels , or when utility rates are low , and powers your home in the evening			1
' it also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup electricity supply			0
' automated , compact and simple to install , @entity5 offers independence from the utility grid and the security of an emergency backup			2
' @entity0 said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices , which he touted as a vast improvement over currently - available models			2
in the past he has said such early batteries ' suck '			0
he later added that the entire showcase had been powered by a huge array of @entity5 batteries			2

@entity0 ( right ) describes it as an ' infinitely scalable system ' that comes in 100 kwh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kwh up to 10 mwh and higher the technology could let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies ' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper , stored energy during peak periods			1
mr @entity0 is already the chairman of @entity183 - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and @entity1 's home battery is an extension of this @entity0 said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices , which he touted as a vast improvement over currently - available models			2
in the past he has said such early batteries ' suck ' @entity1 also unveiled the ' @entity118 ' , which is the larger scale version of the @entity5			1

' our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale , ' it said			0
the latest announcement builds on previous @entity1 products , principally its range of cars			0
last year , @entity1 unveiled plans for a ' @entity214 ' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars , and now homes			0
@entity1 said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent , and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources , such as wind and solar			1
elsewhere , mr @entity0 is already the chairman of @entity183 - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and @entity1 's home battery could be an extension of this			2
these batteries 3ft tall ( 0.9 metres ) , and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. @entity1 would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way			0

powerwall charges using electricity generated from solar panels , or when utility rates are low , and powers your home in the evening ' one can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent , ' the report said			2
@entity250 estimates sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $ 4.5 billion in revenue for @entity1			0
analysts expect @entity1 will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at a large factory the company is building in @entity262			0
stationary storage systems could be part of a fossil - fuel free lifestyle in which an individual has solar panels on the roof , generating electricity that can power home appliances and recharge batteries in a @entity273 sedan parked in the garage			2
government subsidies and a dramatic drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are drawing more companies into the home electricity storage business			0
@entity1 has so far received $ 1.1 million from @entity7 's @entity281			2
@entity1 has received or is poised to receive state funding for about 600 storage projects in @entity7 , according to data from the state			2
though valued at just $ 200 million in 2012 , the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $ 19 billion by 2017 , according to research firm @entity287			0
in @entity1 's view , such storage systems could become part of a fossil - fuel - free lifestyle in which people can have solar panels on their roof generating electricity to power their home and recharge their electric car batteries			0

@entity0 unveiled @entity5 device at press conference in @entity7
@entity302 use version will be able to store 7 kilowatt - hours of electricity
it will let users store renewable energy , or pay lower , off - peak rates
also revealed a larger model which is a ' infinitely scalable system '
