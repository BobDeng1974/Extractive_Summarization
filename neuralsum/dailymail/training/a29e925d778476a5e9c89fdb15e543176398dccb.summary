by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 17:50 est , 15 july 2013 worries : 5ft 3in @entity2 in 2010 when she dropped from 8st to 6 st when @entity2 started at university and rapidly lost weight , she thought the change in her lifestyle was most likely to blame			1
' i 'd gone from enjoying healthy home - cooked food living at home with my parents to living a typical student 's life in @entity13 - going out five nights a week and surviving on takeaways and pot noodles , ' she recalls			1
but that @entity19 , with @entity2 having dropped from 8 st to 6 st ( she is 5ft 3in ) , her friends and family began to fear she was in the grip of an eating disorder			1
' my mum started weighing me each time i came home , and with my weight dropping off , she said if i kept losing weight she 'd pull me out of uni , ' says @entity2			1
' i always said to her i did n't understand it because i was eating more than ever			1
but because i was thirsty all the time , i also kept slipping away after meals to go to the loo			1
' then i heard her and my dad talking about how worried they were about me , and my friends were asking me all the time why i was losing weight			1
' the family were very worried @entity2 might have anorexia			1
' i knew everyone thought i had an eating disorder , which was upsetting , ' says @entity2			1
' but far from having an eating disorder , i was hungry all the time so actually eating more than ever			1
some days , i 'd eat 4,000 calories - but the weight was still falling off me			1
' at the same time , i was experiencing double vision and dizzy spells and fainting			1
one night , shortly after @entity19 , i went to the toilet at 2am , fainted and woke up at 7am on the bathroom floor			2
' when i tried to @entity50 my symptoms , the only thing i could really think it might be was anaemia			1
' @entity2 was also suffering from an ankle injury which would n't heal			2
' i 'd sprained it on a night out in november			2
i thought it would take a few days to heal , but it just did n't improve , and i ended up having to wear a tubigrip all the time			2
' @entity2 was one of the estimated 850,000 people in the @entity59 with undiagnosed diabetes , where blood glucose ( also known as blood sugar ) levels become too high			1
glucose comes from the carbohydrates we eat and the body uses it as fuel			2
the hormone insulin breaks it down and transports it into the cells			2
diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to help glucose enter your body 's cells - or the body becomes resistant to the insulin it does produce , says @entity84 , clinical advisor to the charity @entity86			2
as a result , glucose stays in your blood , where it can not be used as fuel and also harms blood vessels , nerves and organs			1
long - term complications from poorly - controlled diabetes include nerve damage , kidney failure and blindness			1
there are two forms of diabetes			2
type 1 , which develops rapidly , occurs when the insulin - producing cells in the body have been destroyed			2
shock : @entity2 in february 2011 , when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes ' we do not know for certain why this happens , but type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition , in which the immune system mistakes the body 's insulin producing cells as harmful and attacks them , ' says mr @entity84			2
' the body is unable to produce any insulin at all , and the patient 's deterioration is rapid and very visible			2
type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but usually appears before the age of 40 , and especially in childhood			2
' symptoms include frequent urination , feeling thirsty and tired , and weight loss ( because when it 's starved of fuel , the body breaks down its own fat and muscle )			1
type 2 diabetes develops at a much slower pace , and occurs when the body can still make some insulin , but not enough , or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly			2
mr @entity84 says : ' this form of diabetes usually occurs in people over the age of 40 , and is linked to risk factors such as being overweight , which causes the body to become resistant to insulin			1
' it takes people longer to realise that they have type 2 diabetes , or go for check - ups , because they mistake the symptoms such as being tired or needing the loo more as a part of getting older			1
most of the people with undiagnosed diabetes have type 2 diabetes , but some have type 1			1
' with her weight loss , dizzy spells and continuing fainting , @entity2 finally went to see her gp in february			1
he measured her blood sugar levels and sent her straight to hospital			1
' it was really frightening , ' recalls @entity2			2
' i thought i was just going for a check - up , and had even taken a friend with me			0
next thing i knew the doctor was talking about calling an ambulance			0
' in the end , i went in a taxi and my mum was racing down the motorway to @entity13 from her home in @entity181 to meet me there			0
' @entity2 underwent tests and within a matter of hours was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes			0
' it was devastating and very frightening			0
i 'd heard of diabetes , but i did n't fully understand what it was and it sounded as though my entire life was about to change			0
the specialist was talking about me seeing a nutritionist and having a check - up every two months and i was terrified			0
' my mum was in tears			0
she felt she should have known , and prevented it , but the nurses kept telling her there would have been nothing she could have done			0
my mum also said she was so sorry she 'd thought i had an eating disorder			0
it was such a shock , especially as there is n't a history of diabetes in my family			0
' to this day , @entity2 has no idea why she suddenly developed diabetes , but it is thought the autoimmune condition could be linked to a virus , or she could have had a genetic predisposition to it			0
@entity2 was told it was the high sugar levels that had prevented her ankle from healing , as the body 's immune cells - responsible for healing - do not work properly when blood sugar is high			1
two weeks later she underwent an mri scan to check if her high blood sugar levels had caused any long - term damage to her organs or nervous system			1
it had , and she now has to wear glasses because her retinas - the light sensitive area at the back of each eye - have been damaged , a common complication with the condition			0
living life to the full : @entity2 know she has to be more responsible since her diagnosis but she 's looking forward to a healthy , normal future she also had to immediately start insulin injections - which means counting her carbohydrate intake to calculate how much insulin she needs			0
( patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with medication in tablet form , alongside diet and lifestyle changes , although some end up needing insulin injections			0
) the good news is diabetes can be successfully managed over the long term			0
' if patients make the right diet changes , take insulin and attend their appointments , it 's likely they can avoid all the complications of diabetes , ' says mr @entity84			0
today , two years after diagnosis , @entity2 - who has recently graduated with a degree in journalism - has to inject herself with insulin up to ten times daily , depending on what she has eaten			0
@entity2 says : ' because i was a student at the time , i wanted to still feel fairly free and not stick to too rigid a diet , so i focused on learning really accurate carbohydrate counting			0
' i can eat whatever i want : i just have to inject the right amount of insulin , into either my tummy or my leg , to cover the carbohydrates i 've eaten			0
that means on some days , if i eat salad and lean meat , i only inject once , but on another day , if i had a burger in a bun , i might inject many times			0
' the first time i injected i was nervous , but you quickly get used to it			0
' @entity2 's weight is now back to 8 st and her ankle is fully healed			1
' i 've got reading glasses now , which is a bit annoying , but i just tell myself how lucky i am , ' she says			0
' if i had n't gone to the gp when i did , my blood sugar levels would have escalated further and i could have slipped into a coma			1
' the consequences then would have been far more serious			0
i still try to live my life to the full			0
i have to be more responsible than i did before , but i 'm coming to terms with living with a chronic condition			0
i 'm looking forward to a bright , normal and perfectly healthy future			0

an estimated 850,000 people in the @entity59 are undiagnosed diabetics
the *disease* involves blood sugar levels becoming too high
symptoms include frequent urination , thirst , fatigue , and weight loss
