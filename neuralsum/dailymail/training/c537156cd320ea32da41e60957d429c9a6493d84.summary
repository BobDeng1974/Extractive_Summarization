men who drink lots of tea are far more likely to develop prostate cancer , researchers have warned			2
they found that those who drank seven or more cups a day had a 50 per cent higher risk of contracting the disease than men who had three or fewer			1
the warning comes after scientists at the @entity11 tracked the health of more than 6,000 men for four decades			1
results : a study of 6,000 men spanning four decades concluded that those who drank seven cups of tea a day had a 50 per cent higher risk of contracting prostate cancer their findings run counter to previous research , which had suggested that tea - drinking lowers the risk of cancer , as well as heart disease , diabetes and parkinson ’s disease			1
the study , led by dr @entity30 , began in 1970			0
participants aged between 21 and 75 were asked to complete a questionnaire about their usual consumption of tea , coffee and alcohol as well as their smoking habits and general health , and had to attend a screening examination			0
just under a quarter of the 6,016 men were heavy tea drinkers , consuming seven or more cups a day			2
of these , 6.4 per cent developed prostate cancer over the next 37 years			2
researchers found that the subjects who drank the most tea were often teetotal and led healthy lifestyles			1
as a result , they may have been at a lower risk of death from ‘ competing causes ’ , effectively giving them more time to develop prostate cancer , the journal @entity49 reports			0
dr @entity30 said : ‘ most previous research has shown either no relationship with prostate cancer for black tea , or some preventive effect of green tea			2
' we do n’t know whether tea itself is a risk factor or if tea - drinkers are generally healthier and live to an older age , when prostate cancer is more common anyway			2
' new advice : the findings run counter to previous research , which had suggested that tea - drinking lowers the risk of cancer , as well as heart disease , diabetes and @entity79 's disease he added that those drinking the most tea were less likely to be overweight or drink alcohol , and more likely to have healthy cholesterol levels			1
‘ however , we did adjust for these differences in our analysis and still found that men who drank the most tea were at greater risk of prostate cancer , ’ he said			0
dr @entity30 did stress , however , that his team was ‘ unaware of any constituent of black tea that may be responsible for carcinogenic activity in prostate cells ’			0
previous research has found health benefits from flavonoids – antioxidant compounds in tea that are thought to control inflammation , reduce excess blood clotting and limit narrowing of the arteries			1
of seven previous studies on black tea and prostate cancer , four found a potentially protective effect while the remainder found no effect either way			0
dr @entity112 , head of research at @entity114 , said : ‘ whilst it does appear that those who drank seven or more cups of tea each day had an increased risk of developing prostate cancer , this did not take into consideration family history or any other dietary elements other than tea , coffee and alcohol intake			2
‘ it is therefore unclear as to whether there were other factors in play which may have had a greater impact on risk			0
’ almost 80 per cent of @entity134 drink tea , consuming an estimated 165million cups each day			1
the @entity134 tea industry is thought to be worth more than £ 700million a year			0
popular : almost 80 per cent of @entity134 drink tea , consuming an estimated 165million cups each day			1
the @entity134 tea industry is thought to be worth more than £ 700million a year dr @entity138 of the @entity139 , an educational body funded by the industry , said just 92 men in the @entity11 study drank more than seven cups a day and went on to develop prostate cancer			1
she added : ‘ we ’re lacking the complete picture because we do n’t know what other dietary factors were involved			0
other research suggests tea has a protective or neutral effect on prostate cancer , and the authors acknowledge there is no known ingredient in tea that is cancer - causing			0
‘ tea - drinking may be a marker for some sort of behaviour that can raise the risk of prostate cancer , but the study does not show it is a cause			1
’ prostate cancer strikes 40,000 @entity134 men each year , causing more than 10,000 deaths .			0
