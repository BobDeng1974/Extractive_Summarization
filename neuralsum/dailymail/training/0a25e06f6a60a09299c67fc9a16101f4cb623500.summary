after winning the 3,000 meter steeplechase you would expect most athletes to be in a jubilant mood			2
but despite winning the gold medal at the @entity8 championships in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity5 runner @entity4 still seemed far from happy			1
as the 27 - year - old steeplechaser crossed the finish line a 14 - year - old female dressed as the @entity14 ' stood nearby with a gift bag to congratulate him			1
crossing the finish line : @entity4 won gold in the 3,000 metre steeplechase at the @entity19 in @entity9 well - wisher : a 14 - year - old girl dressed as the @entity14 ' approaches the athlete with a gift bag unsporting : @entity4 moves to slap the bag out of the mascot 's hand but rather than celebrate his 8.33.23 - minute victory , @entity4 knocked the bag out of the girl 's hand and shoved her backwards			1
the girl inside the mascot costume was believed to have been slightly winded by the unexpected attack but otherwise unharmed			0
a member of the public caught the hold exchange on camera on sunday and posted it on @entity37			0
shocked : the bag goes flying across the track as stunned members of the public look on @entity42 : @entity4 - @entity4 then shoves the unsuspecting girl not ' @entity44 ' : the schoolgirl only just manages to stay on her feet during the attack championship director @entity47 said : ' hopefully , the @entity48 would deal with the case			2
such behaviour is completely unacceptable			0
' it â€™s not the first time @entity4 has become a @entity37 sensation for all the wrong reasons			0
last year the 27 - year old got into a fight with countryman @entity57 on the finish line of the 1500 meters at the @entity60 games that was caught on tape			1
@entity62 was suspended for 10 months following that incident			0
temper : the athlete then storms off leaving the stunned mascot to recover in a better mood : @entity4 , centre , celebrates on the podium after winning the gold medal in the men 's @entity73 final			2

@entity4 , 27 , has just won gold in the 3,000 metre steeplechase at the @entity19 in @entity9
