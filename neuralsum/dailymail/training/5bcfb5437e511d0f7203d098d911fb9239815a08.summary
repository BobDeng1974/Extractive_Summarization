a brown bear has been spotted in the disaster zone around the @entity2 , the first time one has been seen in the area for 100 years			1
the bear was photographed by an automatic camera trap in the exclusion zone around the @entity8 nuclear power plant , the scene of one of the world 's worst nuclear accidents			1
scientists are studying the area , evacuated since the reactor meltdown in 1986 , to better understand the risks radioactivity poses to humans and wildlife			1
it is far from the first large mammal discovered to be stalking the 30km - radius @entity23			2
dr @entity35 's camera 's have already spotted lynxes , grey wolves , wild boar , elk , horses and otters , among other animals , living in the deserted area			1
project leader @entity55 from the @entity56 told @entity57 : ' we are basically working on the assumption that as you move people out of the equation and human pressure and disturbance is removed , then any animals that have a corridor into the exclusion zone find they are suddenly away from the pressures and dangers presented by people			2
' more than 100,000 people were evacuated from their homes around the damaged @entity2 power station after the april 1986 reactor explosion - the worst nuclear accident until the meltdown at @entity77 in 2011			1
the explosion breached the reactor core , opening it to the elements and belching a massive plume of radioactive fallout that drifted over large parts of the western @entity84 and @entity85			2
the battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers in one of history 's biggest civil engineering tasks , said to have cost an estimated 18 billion rubles ( $ 18billion )			0
disaster site : the @entity2 meltdown in april 1986 was the world 's worst nuclear accident until the disaster at the @entity77 nuclear power plant in @entity99 in 2011 the chernobyl disaster was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on 26 april 1986 at the @entity102 in @entity8			1
an explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere , which spread over much of the western @entity84 and @entity85			0
the chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties , and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the @entity116			0
the battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated Â£ 11 billion ( $ 18 billion )			0
during the accident 31 people died , and long - term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for			0
the tree research programme aims to ' reduce uncertainty in estimating the risk to humans and wildlife associated with exposure to radioactivity and to reduce unnecessary conservatism in risk calculations			1
' it combines controlled laboratory experiments with fieldwork , most of which is planned for the @entity23			0
the researchers will be focusing on three different areas of different levels of contamination to get a comprehensive overview of what species are found in the exclusion zone			0
at any one time 15 cameras will be operating in each area to catch a glimpse of the kinds of wildlife there			1
this first stage of the project will continue until late 2015			2
' once we have completed this particular stage of the study , looking at what animals are there and in what density , we are then going to be selecting one particular species to target for a trapping and collaring campaign , ' dr @entity55 told the @entity57			0
' we will be fitting collars with gps to these animals , and also dose - measurement technology so that we are then able to track movement over the course of a year through the exclusion zone and get a real measurement of the exact radiation exposure that these animals get			0

@entity173 spotted by camera trap set up by radioactivity research project
the abandoned area around @entity2 has become a wildlife haven
scientists hope their research there will help them understand radioactivity
