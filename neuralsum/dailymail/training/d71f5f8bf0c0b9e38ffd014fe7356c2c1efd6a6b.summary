establishing a nation can be thirsty work , so no one would begrudge @entity4 's @entity3 raising a glass or two once the job was done			0
but at a time when the tavern was as important a part of daily life as church , quite how many glasses they would have considered an appropriate celebration has until now remained unclear			2
new research has revealed that @entity4 's early colonialists drank an average of six gallons of pure alcohol every year - almost three times more than their modern @entity21 ancestors			1
indeed , the @entity3 were such heavy drinkers that , in the 18th century , there were more taverns per capita than any other business in the country			1
high times : @entity28 's @entity27 in @entity29 of circa 1758 depicts a drunken scene featuring various prominent @entity32 merchants , including @entity34 signatory @entity33 , governor @entity35 , admiral @entity36 , and governor @entity37 and , in news that may come as little surprise to many , drinking as a social pastime was inspired by none other than the @entity42			1
the revelation is a far cry from modern @entity21 drinking culture , which is today one of the most restrained in the developed world			1
according to @entity48 , of the @entity49 , @entity51 settlers who had crossed the @entity53 laden with hopes , dreams and barrel - loads of booze inspired @entity21 to imbibe more beer and spirits with a habit for starting each new round with a hearty toast			1
" @entity63 ( anonymous , 1846 ) : by the early nineteenth century , the culture of heavy drinking in @entity4 had given rise to a home - grown temperance movement phd student ms @entity48 says that ' drinking healths ' was a uniquely @entity51 custom and ' a way for @entity51 drinkers to combine a display of respect with the consumption of alcohol '			1
the @entity21 has one of the lowest rates of drinking in the developed world			1
research shows that average @entity21 drink just 9.4 litres of alcohol a year - the same as 470 pints of mild beer or 31 glasses of wine			1
the figure is much lower than @entity86 where the average @entity42 drinker sinks 1100 pints of beer each year and @entity89 have 1350 pints of beer and 90 bottles of vodka			2
but the region also has one of the highest rates of alcohol related deaths coming second only behind @entity86			0
in @entity99 per cent of all deaths of 15 to 29 - year - olds were alcohol related			0
' [ it was ] certainly a win - win situation for those who favored the practice ' , she adds			0
however , as the custom quickly spread through the taverns of @entity4 , it was not met with universal approval			0
@entity108 tells the story of @entity111 judge @entity110 who ' encountered frustrating resistance ' when he tried to turn out a rambunctious crowd of drinkers from a pub in 1714			0
' they refused to go away , ' he later wrote			0
' [ they ] said [ they ] were there to drink the @entity121 ’s health , and they had many other healths to drink			0
' far from heeding his protestations , the crowd soon began to make fun of @entity127 , repeatedly drinking to his health in mocking jest			2
' [ they ] call ’d for more drink ; drank to me ; i took notice of the affront … i threatened to send some of them to prison ; that did not move them , ' he added with frustration			0
both his feelings and sensibilities hurt , the crestfallen judge soon soon realised his protest was useless , admitted defeat and left the pub. @entity108 adds : ' not always understood , and at times criticized , " drinking healths " continued to remain a favorite way of passing the time in the @entity21 colonies			1
' with such an appetite for intoxicating liquors , the colonists lacked no excuse for imbibing their favorite beverages , but this old @entity51 custom certainly made the act more entertaining for assembled groups like the one described by @entity110			0
' @entity4 the sober : the revelation is a far cry from modern @entity21 drinking culture , which is today one of the most sober in the developed world			2

research is part of a phd thesis by @entity48 , of @entity170
in 1700s , there were more taverns per capita than any other business in @entity21
heavy drinking was in part inspired by @entity42 tradition of ' toasting health '
