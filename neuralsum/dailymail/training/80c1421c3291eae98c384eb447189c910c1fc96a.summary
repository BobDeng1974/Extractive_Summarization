by @entity0 published : 16:55 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 09:10 est , 2 november 2012 @entity2 mayor @entity1 - a political independent who has played a prominent role in the aftermath of @entity7 - has delivered a big boost to president @entity9 by endorsing him for re-election			1
@entity1 , a @entity11 who became a @entity12 to run for @entity14 mayor in 2001 and ran as an @entity15 for re-election in 2009 , said that @entity7 had helped reshape his thinking about the presidential campaign			1
he had been pointedly critical of both @entity9 and @entity19 , saying that both men had failed to address properly the problems afflicting the nation			1
the pair are pictured together in 2008 @entity29 : @entity1 said that @entity7 had helped reshape his thinking about the presidential campaign			1
he is pictured viewing damage in the @entity34 area of @entity35 in @entity2 but he said in recent days he had decided that @entity9 was the best candidate to tackle climate change , which the mayor cited as a contributory factor to the violent storm that took the lives of at least 38 @entity2 and brought carnage costing billions of dollars			1
‘ the devastation that @entity7 brought to @entity2 and much of the @entity46 - in lost lives , lost homes and lost business - brought the stakes of next tuesday ’s presidential election into sharp relief , ’ he wrote in an article for his own website ‘ @entity44 ’			2
‘ our climate is changing			0
and while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in @entity2 and around the world may or may not be the result of it , the risk that it may be - given the devastation it is wreaking - should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action			0
’ the timing of the endorsement is unexpected because @entity1 this week publicly called on @entity9 to resist visiting @entity2 this week because the city was too busy dealing with the disaster			1
comfort : a recent poll found that 80 per cent of voters viewed @entity9 's actions favourably following the storm			0
he is pictured embracing @entity71 during a tour of a neighborhood effected by @entity7 at work : @entity1 is pictured updating @entity2 on the city 's response to @entity7 but his backing is the latest indication that @entity7 could be a big factor in tuesday ’s election			1
@entity9 has already used it to burnish his bipartisan credentials and a @entity85 / @entity84 poll found that 80 per cent of voters viewed his actions favourably			0
republicans dismissed the endorsement saying that @entity92 , as the epitome of the monied east coast elite , would hardly sway voters in the @entity95 battleground states			0
but there is little doubt that the @entity19 campaign would dearly have loved to have had the @entity2 mayor ’s backing			2
@entity9 said in a statement : ‘ i am honoured to have mayor @entity1 's endorsement			2
i deeply respect him for his leadership in business , philanthropy and government , and appreciate the extraordinary job he 's doing right now , leading @entity2 through these difficult days			0
disappointed : there is little doubt that the @entity19 campaign would have loved to have had the @entity2 mayor 's backing			2
@entity19 is pictured at a campaigning event friendly : @entity9 , left , is pictured having breakfast with @entity2 mayor @entity1 , right , in 2007 ‘ while we may not agree on every issue , mayor @entity1 and i agree on the most important issues of our time - that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people , that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy , and that climate change is a threat to our children 's future , and we owe it to them to do something about it			1
‘ just as importantly , we agree that whether we are @entity135 , republicans , or independents , there is only one way to solve these challenges and move forward as a nation - together			0
‘ i look forward to thanking him in person - but for now , he has my continued commitment that this country will stand by @entity2 in its time of need			0
' and @entity2 have my word that we will recover , we will rebuild , and we will come back stronger			0
