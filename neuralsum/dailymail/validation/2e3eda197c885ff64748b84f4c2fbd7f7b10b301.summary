@entity0 will ask his team to target the 72 - point barrier to be sure of winning what @entity3 dubbed @entity6 ’s @entity5			1
five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two @entity10 places behind @entity11 and @entity12 and it could prove more tense and exciting than the @entity14 title race itself			1
adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join @entity20 ’s elite next season must swallow an estimated £ 30million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved @entity24			0
@entity0 will ask his team to target the 72 - point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish @entity3 said that he believed @entity0 's estimation of the necessary points total ‘ the best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can , ’ said @entity28 manager @entity0			1
‘ you can see the quality of the teams behind us			2
seventy - two points might be enough			2
‘ people have finished in the top four with 67 points , but if you look at this year , we have 51 points , so it will be in the 70s			1
it is a tough run - in , similar to last year			0
’ @entity28 finished fourth last year with 79 points , well clear of @entity42 in fifth with 72			1
it is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years			0
when @entity42 came fourth in 2005 , they had 61 points ahead of @entity49 in fifth with 58			1
in each of the past two years , however , the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points			1
@entity52 acknowledged @entity0 ’s years of expertise in the area			1
‘ i want to believe him , ’ said the @entity56 boss			1
‘ it is a rat race			2
it is going into the last week			2
’ @entity28 have not given up hope of catching @entity12 to finish second , but there is a nine - point gap to @entity11 who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we are nowhere near close to being in the title race			1
we are too far from @entity11 to say that we are in the title race , but you never know what can happen			2
‘ why should @entity12 give up for the title ? they did it before from eight points behind			2
without speculating on the weaknesses of any team , we want to be consistent and do as well as we can			0
’ @entity78 winner @entity77 has been in impressive form for @entity28 since returning from injury @entity28 suffered a @entity83 wobble but form is strong in the @entity14 , winning six of seven since defeat at @entity87 on @entity88 , after which @entity0 switched goalkeepers			1
attention is spread over three competitions , although maybe not for long			0
they trail @entity93 1 - 3 in the @entity10 and go to @entity56 in the @entity94			1
they are awash with goals , have key players fit and options to make changes , especially up front			0
also experienced top - four finishers , with an eye still on catching @entity12			2
@entity104 games to play : 3			0
@entity106 has returned to an attacking role since @entity109 's injury and has performed well there @entity56 results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of @entity109 ’s injury has moved @entity106 back up front which may prove serendipitous			1
but they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures , with five of the top seven to play and trips to @entity119 , @entity42 and @entity120			0
away form is poor , with 16 points on the road this season — the worst in top half barring @entity126			1
fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals , but more likely a problem with form so sluggish			0
should at least be fresh , having only played 32 games in all competitions			0
@entity49 have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat @entity12 @entity49 finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start			1
helped by a settled system , the return of @entity143 and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of @entity147 and , to a lesser extent , @entity149			0
they boast the best form in the @entity14 since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past			0
they also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more @entity20 , but finish with awkward away games at @entity11 and @entity157			0
no sign of fatigue but @entity160 is their 45th game of the season			0
@entity166 has impressed for @entity87 this season as the @entity87 surprised everyone @entity87 scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager @entity171 since the end of january , as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing @entity10 qualification and are plotting to stop them			1
perhaps this , together with increased expectations , is catching up with them after a brilliant start			0
injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which can not boast the same depth as others pursuing the @entity10			2
the dream faded during february , a month when @entity87 scored once in five games , but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish			1
@entity193 has been in superb form for @entity195 this season , scoring 24 goals so far in all competitions @entity195 in a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a @entity24 exit and @entity203 defeat inside three days			2
can they be revived and refocused after a gruelling season of 45 games to date ? there are 12 more to go , including seven tricky away fixtures			0
it is a character test for a young team which has key players such as @entity193 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 completing their first full @entity14 campaign			0
or will boss @entity216 have to go back to those he has cut off , such as @entity218 and @entity219 ? @entity104 games : 3			0

@entity0 believes 72 points will be enough to finish in the top four
@entity3 said he agreed and that the race would go to the final week
five teams , @entity28 , @entity56 , @entity87 , @entity49 and @entity195 are fighting for two @entity10 places
