by @entity1 reporter many a mother will know the feeling – you ’re flitting around busily when suddenly one of your brood pipes up : ‘ mum ! i ’m hungry ! ’ within seconds the rest of the flock have joined in the chorus and there ’s nothing for it but to find some nice tasty flies to keep them quiet			1
flies ? well , that was the only thing that was going to please these recently fledged swallows spotted at @entity16 , @entity17			1
feed us mum : the swallows , pictured at @entity16 , @entity17 , call out for their dinner what about me ? : the mother drops food into the beak of one of her young as its sibling swallows ' jealously call out for their turn to get fed meals on wings : the mother swallow swoops in and drops a tasty morsel into the mouth of one of her young food envy : one of the swallows can be seen swallowing down a tasty insect as its jealous sibling looks on more than a mouthful : this hungry swallow can barely get the insect down the swallows home : the feeding scenes were captured at @entity16 in @entity17 in the main picture , mother can be seen top left as she circles in , ready to feed chick number one as the other two perform the bird equivalent of ‘ @entity51 ! what about me ? ’ wildlife photographer @entity53 , who took these pictures , said : ‘ the parents feed their young up to 400 times a day but passing food can take less than a second			1
@entity59 and you ’ll miss it			0
‘ the chicks are much better at spotting the adults coming back than i am , loudly begging and opening their mouths wide as they approach			0
i focused on the chicks and as soon as i saw the tell - tale signs my finger was ready on the trigger			0
’ my turn : as the mother feeds one of her young , another angrily tries to get her attention dancing for their dinner : the hungry swallows flap their wings in a desperate attempt to get their mother 's attention and get fed next come back already : as their mother flies off , the swallows can be seen squawking in unison , most probably telling her they 've still got room for more large flies make up to 80 per cent of their diet but they also eat aphids , flying ants and wasps			1
mr @entity53 said : ‘ one chick received a wasp that was just too big to handle			2
its sibling greedily poked his head close looking for an opportunity to steal it			2
