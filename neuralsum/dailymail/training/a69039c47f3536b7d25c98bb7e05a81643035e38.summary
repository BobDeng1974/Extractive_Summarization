after losing two straight home games heading into a tilt as the away team at @entity5 against the @entity6 on sunday , @entity1 players were happy to see quarterback @entity7 back at practice on thursday			1
besides @entity7 himself , perhaps no one was happier than wide receiver @entity11			1
the fifth - year pro , who called @entity7 ’s return ‘ very exciting ’ , said : ‘ it was like he never left			1
we had a great day of practice			1
we ’re just going to move forward and see what happens on sunday			2
’ ‘ it always helps whenever @entity7 ’s out there			1
whenever he ’s out there it makes everybody feel that much more comfortable			2
he know how to lead us in the right direction and that ’s what he ’s gon na do on sunday			2
’ @entity7 could return to the @entity1 starting line - up the @entity30 ’s leading rusher , @entity29 , was glad to see @entity7 moving ‘ like he always does ’ in his return to the field			1
' it was good to see him back out there , ’ said the 26 - year - old			1
‘ i thought he did well today			2
it ’s always good to have your leader out there			0
we ’re excited to have him back			2
’ not having @entity7 throwing passes may have had an impact earlier in the week , but practising outside of the @entity45 was n’t really an issue			1
@entity11 said : ‘ i do n’t think we ’ve missed a beat			1
i was telling the guys , i do n’t know if it ’s @entity51 or the air , but i ’m flying			0
everybody else is flying around too			0
i got a little extra juice			0
’ @entity29 , who has 1,133 rushing yards this season , agreed the workouts at @entity57 have been beneficial			0
he said : ‘ we ’ve had two good days of practise			0
obviously we have n’t been playing as expected individually or as a collective group			2
we ’ve learned from the mistakes we made and the things we did well			0
we ’ll continue to get better during the week and see what happens on sunday			2
’ the @entity1 have struggled with @entity7 banged up during the last two games			1
the team has only scored 34 points combined and no player has suffered more than @entity11 ( five catches , 45 yards ) in @entity7 ’s absence			1
the former first round pick is n’t phased or feeling any added pressure to perform on sunday with 34 - year - old @entity7 likely operating at less than 100 per cent			1
@entity11 said : ‘ i can only control what i can control			1
y’all watch the same tape that i watch			0
when it comes my way , i ’m gon na try and make the most of it			0
no pressure at all man			0
what is pressure ? ’ if the team continues to lean on the running game despite @entity7 ’s return , it wo n’t bother @entity11			1
he said : ‘ not at all			0
we run the ball and we ’re going to throw the ball whenever we need to			0
we ’re just gon na continue to work on our mistakes , get the wrinkles out and get back together			2
trust me , we are			0
’ with their focus squarely on prepping for @entity6 , the @entity1 have n’t really had much time to explore or blow off steam			1
@entity11 , who managed to squeeze in a steak dinner for his 25th birthday on tuesday , is planning to ‘ step out ’ on friday			1
‘ i want to see what ’s out there , ’ he said			0
‘ so far what i ’ve seen is great			0
i ’ve been having fun and i ’m gon na try my best to come back in the offseason			2
i ’m just looking forward to the rest of this @entity51 trip			0
’ it ’s a trip that has n’t included any celebratory cake , birthday or otherwise , thus far			0
‘ i ca n’t eat cake , ’ @entity11 said			1
‘ i got ta keep my abs right			0
’ if the offense performs well and the cowboy leave @entity5 with a win on sunday , perhaps he ’ll reconsider .			1
