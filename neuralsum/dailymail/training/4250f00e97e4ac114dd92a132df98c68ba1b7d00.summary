the kitchen is new territory for @entity4 which so far has been used to win at @entity14 and to work on a cure for cancer			2
recipe for success : @entity1 's supercomputer @entity4 has been testing its culinary skills domestic science : @entity1 teamed up with @entity8 to see if the supercomputer could create new recipes the cooking app - chef @entity4 with bon appetit - works by using data the supercomputer has taken from more than 9,000 recipes			1
new combinations are then created by @entity4 , which analyzes data on the compounds in ingredients , and how frequently they are combined in different dishes			2
tests so far have come up with some unusual , but delicious options such as a @entity35 butternut bbq sauce			0
@entity4 , which according to @entity36 cost @entity1 an estimated $ 900 million to develop , came up with the unusual combination after being asked to create an @entity40 sauce using butternut			1
the designers likened the process to ' watching an episode of @entity45 in real time '			0
combo : a food truck at the @entity49 in @entity50 serves up treats based on data taken from thousands of different recipes challenge : the cooking test was new ground for @entity4 , which has previously been used in cancer research ' you get a bunch of ingredients and then decide what to do with them			1
the difference here is that every ingredient you ’re presented with already goes well together , even if you do n’t know it yet , ' they said			0
the combinations have excited and surprised the @entity8 team , who were curious about what creations @entity4 would deliver			1
editor in chief @entity74 told the @entity75 : ' we see the intersection of technology and food sparking new thinking and creativity not only in our own test kitchen , but in our reader 's homes as well			2

new ground : @entity1 says its multi-million - dollar supercomputer is improved by such interactions as the food challenge ' we ’re always trying to find some sort of hook , or kicker for our recipes ... it ’s very hard to reinvent the wheel , ' food editor @entity109 said			1
with @entity4 however , ' you ’re given the answer - the ingredient list - before you really know what questions to ask '			0
she said the process made her consider combinations she may never have come up with on her own , ' like the @entity125 spicy mustard on the ribs ... or the marjoram in the berry cobbler '			0
for the @entity1 team , the cooking app offered another chance to test their supercomputer 's capabilities			0
senior vice-president @entity134 said @entity135 wanted to ' to help people discover the potential of cognitive computing systems '			0
' these systems can understand vast amounts of data , compounds , and formulas as well as learn from interactions with people and information , in a far more intuitive way , ' he added .			0

@entity1 's @entity4 blends data from more than 9,000 recipes to offer new ideas
