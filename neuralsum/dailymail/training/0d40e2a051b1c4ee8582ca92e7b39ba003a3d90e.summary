a student has taken the @entity2 craze for dangerous dares to new heights by downing a pint in the cockpit of a plane			1
@entity8 , 21 , uploaded a video of himself in the front seat of a light aircraft with one hand on the control column and the other holding what appears to be a pint of lager			1
it is not clear who filmed the @entity21 student , originally from @entity22 , @entity23 , while he was carrying out the stunt			1
mr @entity8 was a passenger rather than co-pilot and there is nothing to suggest he is intoxicated			1
the head of one @entity44 flying school said they banned all alcohol in their light aircraft because they ' do not mix '			1
mr @entity8 , who is reading business studies and sports studies , is heard in the video saying : ' ready for a pint			1
' as mr @entity8 downs the pint in one , his hands are on the controls of the plane in front of him			1
after posting it on his @entity60 page , a friend called @entity61 wrote : ' haha quality mate			0
reports of a small aircraft swerving over @entity22 can be confirmed then			2
' a @entity34 leaflet on passenger safety in light aircraft states that pilots should ' not take passengers who are under the influence of alcohol ( or anything worse ) '			1
it adds : ' they could hazard the flight			0
drunkenness in an aircraft is an offence under @entity79			2
' mr @entity8 , from @entity23 , is reading business studies and sports studies at @entity21			1
he could not be contacted for comment the @entity2 craze is thought to have originated in @entity84 , @entity85 , but thanks to social media it has since gone global			0
the concept of the game has been described by a user on @entity60 as : ' neck your drink			0
do n't break the chain , do n't be a d * * k. ' the stunt is filmed then posted on the internet			2
one popular video shows a bare - chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head - first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up			0
another extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and downing a can of @entity110			0
however , the trend has taken a dark trend in recent weeks as reports have begun to emerge of young men dying after drinking huge amounts of alcohol for a dare			0
@entity117 , an instructor at @entity118 , said that it would be ' inadvisable ' to let passengers on board a light aircraft drink any alcohol			1
mr @entity117 said : ' alcohol and planes do not mix. if it is a passenger drinking it is not illegal but it is inadvisable			0
it 's up to the pilot , but it is absolutely not advisable			0
' we would n't allow anyone to take alcohol on the plane at all			0
we have a line that says there should be at least eight hours between the bottle and the throttle			0
' a spokesman for the @entity34 said : ' although passengers are not prohibited from drinking alcohol onboard an aircraft , they are legally obliged to follow the instructions of the pilot in command at all times			2
' if a passenger 's actions interfere with the pilot 's control of the aircraft , they can be charged with recklessly endangering that aircraft , an offence taken very seriously by the courts , and which carries with it the possibility of a custodial sentence			1
' mr @entity8 could not be contacted for comment			1
his mother , @entity159 , from @entity22 , said that her son was not the co-pilot , but did not wish to comment any further			0
in another @entity2 video , 29 - year - old @entity162 , from @entity163 , @entity164 , was filmed risking his life to complete a dare			2
in these pictures he can be seen jumping off a cliff into rough seas while downing an alcoholic drink before being pushed under water by strong waves			0
