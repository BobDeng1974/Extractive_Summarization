by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:13 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 15:16 est , 26 september 2013 a @entity3 police officer who forced a young woman to lift her shirt and shake out her bra during a routine traffic stop has been suspended without pay for one day			1
the punishment was handed down to @entity11 police officer @entity10 wednesday after video of the may 21 traffic stop of @entity14 sparked outrage in @entity11 and across the country			1
despite search tactics that the @entity20 called ' highly questionable ' and ' demeaning , ' the a @entity11 police investigation found that @entity10 did n't violate the department 's strip - search policy			1
he was technically suspended not for making miss @entity14 shake out her bra , but instead for not using his microphone to record audio during the traffic stop - or for several previous stops he made , according to the @entity27			1
officers found no evidence of drugs or other illegal substances when they pulled @entity55 and boyfriend @entity56 over this spring for having only one working headlight			2
@entity14 told @entity58 that @entity10 ' made me go through the whole humiliating ordeal with shaking my bra out , right there in the middle of this parking lot on @entity64			1
' when no drugs appeared , @entity10 ' told me that he was taking me to @entity67 jail for driving on a suspended license and that they had an x-ray machine there and they were definitely going to find what i had hidden inside of me , ' @entity14 said			1
@entity14 was driving on an invalid license , which was enough reason to arrest her			0
instead he asked to search the vehicle , and when the couple relented , he searched it anyway			0
another office who showed up as backup considered the search improper			0
@entity10 broke another rule during the stop by leaving the audio off in the dash camera			0
if the audio had been turned on , ' there would be little to no speculation as to what occurred during that traffic stop , ' said state attorney investigator @entity90			0
at the end of the stop , @entity10 told @entity94 ' i 'm done scaring you , and now you can do home , ' she told @entity98			0
after the incident , she filed a complaint and notified the @entity101			2
bold : @entity14 , left , had just returned from picking up her boyfriend from work			0
he was in the car the whole time officer @entity10 searched @entity14 state attorney @entity20 called for an investigation and wrote a critical letter to the @entity108 saying that the search was ' highly questionable ' and not only ' demeaning ' but ' ineffective and possibly dangerous			1
' he cited the fact that , if @entity14 had been concealing a weapon , asking her to shake out her bra would have just given her access to that weapon			2
@entity10 , on the other hand , told investigators that the search method ' is a known technique that is used by some @entity108 officers though he ca n't recall formally being trained to use it			2
' looking back on the incident ( @entity10 ) recognizes that he was overzealous in his attempt to locate illegal drugs or contraband in the car , ' @entity90 said			2
@entity10 was put on a four day suspension with pay during the investigation and returned to work on june 18			0
the @entity108 will now be conducting their own investigation of the incident , in order to determine whether or not to terminate @entity10			1
' this department does not condone the alleged actions as have been reported in recent days and any officer proven to be involved in this type of behavior will be dealt with accordingly , including possible termination , ' lakeland police chief @entity132 said in a statement .			0
