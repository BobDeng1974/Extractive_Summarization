i can remember so clearly visiting the hospital to see @entity2 the day after that horrific knife attack in @entity4			1
as soon as i walked in i looked into his eyes and i knew exactly what he was thinking - is it all over ? the wound was horrific , some 38 staples virtually holding his thigh together			1
i could n’t believe it , only weeks before we had been celebrating the biggest moment of his career when he dethroned welterweight sensation @entity20 in his back yard to capture the @entity23 welterweight title			2
suddenly we are sitting there waiting to find out if he would ever be able to enter a ring again			0
the doctor ’s analysis was n’t great - she said with the right rehab there was a decent chance he could fight again but he would not be able to perform in the same way in and out of the ring			1
she could n’t have been more wrong			0
@entity2 performs at a media workout ahead of the first defence of his world title against @entity38 brook at home shortly after he was stabbed ( left ) and showing his scar ( right ) on the week of his fight over the last few months @entity2 has shown the heart of a lion			1
no one really gets to see the struggle he went through - dressing the wound , struggling to walk at first , the endless hours of rehab and massage and this is all before the camp got underway			2
what we have now , just days away from the first defence of his @entity23 welterweight title is an elite level fighter , someone who i believe can go on and unify the 147lb division and someone who is in devastating form , ready to make a statement to the world in front of his home fans			0
saturday in @entity66 is going to be an emotional night			0
no one has taken @entity38 for granted - he has earned the right to challenge @entity2 as the no 1 and mandatory challenger - a position @entity2 was in not so long ago			1
he is confident and full of hope to become world champion but he has a wounded lion in front of him who is ready to bite			0
it will be an awkward fight			2
@entity38 is a southpaw who comes on strong late in fights			1
another challenge for @entity2 will be handling the emotions of the situation in front of 10,000 people			1
but i believe in @entity2			1
i think he has to impose himself early and i suspect he ’ll produce a devastating performance with a stoppage somewhere in the middle rounds			1
@entity38 has earned his shot at @entity92 after becoming the mandatory challenger for his @entity23 world title there are some huge plans ahead for @entity2 but for now it ’s all about saturday			1
live on @entity98 and live on @entity99 in the @entity100 - finally he gets his chance to get his big homecoming			1
it ’s going to be some night			0
fight fans can tune into a packed bill from 7.30pm - @entity107 makes his @entity109 debut against @entity110 ahead of his massive fight with @entity112 on may 9 in @entity113 and @entity114 continues his fairlytale career battling @entity117 ’s @entity116 for the vacant @entity119 title			1
big - punching @entity66 middleweight @entity120 could be in a fight of the year contender with @entity122 , who dismantled @entity124 super-middleweight @entity123 in his last visit to the @entity126			1
@entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 are also in action			0
@entity120 ( above ) takes on @entity122 in what promises to be an intriguing fight in @entity66 last week we announced a huge show for may 30 at the @entity135 in @entity124			2
after his destruction of @entity138 at the same venue earlier this year , @entity136 will go toe to toe with three - weight world champion @entity141			2
that fight , for the @entity144 ’s @entity143 world lightweight title , is going to be an absolute cracker			0
it is a real 50 - 50 fight			2
it is going to be a huge night of boxing in the capital , a year after that massive occasion at @entity152			0
the @entity153 , @entity154 , is fighting @entity155 for the @entity23 featherweight title and that is another fight that could go either way			0
@entity136 ( left ) will challenge for @entity160 when he takes on the @entity143 champion in may @entity162 is on the bill against @entity164 , a loud @entity100 with some real talent			1
people ask me about @entity168 and how he is recovering after the stress fracture in his back			2
i watched him sparring in a three - hour session last week and he is looking devastating			2
i left that day feeling more convinced than ever that this guy is going to be the world heavyweight champion			0
he will fight first on april 4 in @entity174 and i will make an announcement on his opponent in the coming days			0
i will meet @entity177 and @entity179 ’s team in @entity124 today as we work towards making the fight everyone wants to see between @entity179 and @entity182			1
two world champions from @entity126 in the same division – they simply have to fight			0
i have submitted my proposal to them and am waiting to hear what they have from their side			0
i feel we need to make progress now			0
the hope is for a summer fight , possibly on june 20			0
but all dates , venues and purse splits ca n’t be decided until we know where we are going with the broadcaster			0
i think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon , probably the next two or three weeks , if we are to get this fight on in the summer			0
it really is the fight people want to see			2
@entity179 ( left ) and @entity182 look set to unify their super-bantamweight world titles this summer i should know in the next 24 hours what date @entity205 will fight @entity207 for the @entity23 super-middleweight world title vacated by @entity209			1
contrary to rumours stateside , it will most likely be in mid to late may on the @entity100 east coast .			1

people have *n't* seen how much @entity2 has had to suffer
i back him to beat @entity38 by stoppage in the middle rounds
i will meet @entity219 on *wednesday* to *discuss* @entity182 fight
@entity205 - @entity207 will likely be in may on @entity100 east coast
it will take more than a fractured back to stop @entity162
he has looked *vicious* in sparring ahead of his return next weekend
