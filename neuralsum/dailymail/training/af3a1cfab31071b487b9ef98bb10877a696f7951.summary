it ’s the only word for it			2
why would someone with a face as pretty and as interesting as actress @entity2 voluntarily do that to herself ? or , as a friend of mine said last night as we were discussing it ( there really was no other topic of conversation ) , at what point do you sit down with your plastic surgeon , point to the ‘ poor man ’s @entity18 ’ page and say ‘ i ’ll have that one ’ ? it ’s not so much that she does n’t look attractive			1
it ’s more that she does n’t look like @entity2			1
in fact , she does n’t look like anyone in particular			2
her face , once so instantly recognisable , is now about as memorable as a shop dummy ’s			1
this person , the strange - looking person who used to be the film star @entity2 , has one of the worst cases of @entity33 ( face gone weird syndrome ) i have ever seen			1
it ’s the only word for it			2
why would someone with a face as pretty and as interesting as actress @entity2 voluntarily do that to herself ? asks @entity41 all the elements of attractiveness are there : blonde hair , blue eyes , plump lips , smooth skin			1
but a human face is much more than the sum of its parts			2
and that ’s how you end up with @entity33			1
all those treatments , those fillers , or those jabs , or those little nips and tucks , are fine in theory			1
in practice , however , it ’s quite another story			1
what ’s more , it appears to be catching			2
a couple of weeks ago , @entity65 appeared in public with the unmistakable early warning signs of @entity33			1
a waxy sheen to her complexion ; patches of eerily smooth skin ; and an almost total absence of shadows on the face , lending it a strange , one - dimensional quality			1
it does n’t only affect the older generation , either			2
at just 28 , @entity79 appears to be suffering from early onset @entity33 — although with her it ’s often hard to tell whether that slight puffiness is due to fillers or the fact that her liver ’s having to work double shifts			1
even more worrying is @entity88 , 26 , whose minxy charm seems to be giving way to a @entity92 glassiness			0
@entity93 is well known for her changed appearance over the years , a sufferer of ' @entity33 ' syndrome says @entity41 other famous sufferers include @entity93 ( who many experts agree might well qualify as patient zero in this worldwide epidemic ) , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
all women who in their perfectly understandable quest to slow down the signs of ageing have instead succeeded in turning themselves into someone else			1
this someone else is no one you ’ve ever seen before			0
she looks like everyone and no one			0
and you do n’t just see her in the pages of the magazines or in the movies , either			2
she is everywhere , in swanky @entity117 restaurants , laughing into her champagne at parties , walking her dog in the better postcodes of @entity122			0
i come across her often in my line of work			0
she ’s common at political fundraisers , dripping in diamonds on the arm of some corpulent industrialist with a bulge in his back pocket and a yen for a peerage			2
there she is again , at a charity concert , or picking up the kids in her white @entity137 before speeding off to the @entity138 for the weekend			0
you ’ll see her turning left on a half - term flight to @entity142 , or exercising with grim purpose at a gym in @entity145			0
@entity103 is a victim of ' face gone weird ' syndrome says @entity41			1
she thinks that by trying to slow down the ageing process women have succeeded in turning themselves into someone else			1
her friends worry about her			0
they wonder , should they intervene ? but how can you ? how can you say to a woman who looks at herself in the mirror each morning and sees a reflection of her ‘ happy , healthy lifestyle ’ ( as @entity157 star @entity2 attributed her new face to yesterday ) that she just looks weird			1
that the fillers and @entity161 and little lifts here and there have erased many of the signs of ageing , but in doing so they ’ve also removed much of the character that made her , as an individual , special ? the problem with @entity33 is that while the outward signs may be physical , the root cause is a complex tangle of psychological factors			1
a young @entity175 ( left ) and now ( right )			0
@entity41 says she comes across women who have had work done on their faces all the time			1
it ’s not as simple as wanting to look younger			2
it ’s to do with a whole variety of pressures , emanating from many different sources			2
for @entity33 , you see , is the ultimate expression of the hyper - critical self - loathing that many women , rich , poor , successful or otherwise , feel when they look in the mirror			1
it is — and i truly believe this — a form of self - harm , every bit as distressing and as damaging as bulimia or anorexia			0
it used to be the case that when things were n’t going her way , a woman would repair to the hairdressers for a new cut , or treat herself to a new shade of lipstick			2
she might go blonde , or lose weight — anything , really , to lift the spirits , to take back control and get back on top			0
@entity101 is credited for her hard work keeping fit and defying her age but her face has also defied gravity now she books herself in for some @entity161			0
and while she ’s at it , maybe a few fillers			1
and is it really true that there ’s a jaw - lift that does n’t involve surgery ? can i really have the fat under my chin dissolved by a simple injection ? a tweak here , a tweak there			2
always close to the desired result , but never quite			0
perhaps one more chemical peel , doctor , do you think that will do it ? none of these things on their own are necessarily an issue			0
@entity241 , for example , have @entity161 two or three times a year in the vertical frown lines between my brows			0
it does n’t make them disappear , it just softens them very slightly			0
i ’m always being offered other treatments — peels , lasers and the rest			0
@entity254 maintains that her face is 100 per cent natural and she has not used botox or fillers but i say no. at 47 , i ’m ok with the way i look			2
granted , i ’m not as dewy as i once was , and my jowls are definitely more on the wobbly side than i would like ; but the only thing that really depresses me is that wretched frown line , and so that ’s as far as i go			0
anything else would be a slippery slope			0
because it ’s the layering of treatments that does it , the slow , silent creep			1
in the same way that you never notice you ’re getting fat because the process happens in a series of small increments over a long period of time , it ’s hard to recognise @entity33 in yourself			1
it ’s not until , say , you step out at an awards ceremony having been out of the public eye for a few years and the whole world goes ‘ woah , there lady , what have you done with our @entity2 ? ’ that maybe you realise you might have gone a smidge too far			1
but then i have one big advantage over all these women			0
i am not a film star			0
i do n’t have to appear ten times magnified in glorious @entity289 on a big screen , or be photographed on the red carpet and my pictures beamed around the world			0
i do n’t have newspapers and magazines scrutinising my every look			0
all those treatments , those fillers , or those jabs , or those little nips and tucks , are fine in theory			1
in practice , however , it ’s quite another story , says @entity41			1
@entity305 has drastically changed in appearance since her younger days and because i ’m too old to be a fully paid - up member of the selfie generation , i ’m not endlessly taking photos of myself on my smartphone and posting them on @entity311 either , a fact that goes some way to providing me with a certain immunity to @entity33			2
the same , sadly , can not be said of my daughter ’s generation			0
already , aged 11 , they all have their special ‘ photo - faces ’ , certain practised expressions and angles they have learned to adopt in order to look their best			0
i have yet to acquire mine : if someone points a lens at me i just grin like a baboon , all chins and piggy eyes			0
hashtag fail , as young people say these days			0
question is , will @entity33 spread beyond the rich and famous to ordinary girls and women ? now we have the means — salons offering an array of so - called non surgical procedures up and down the country — will all women gradually morph into broadly the same person ? sad to say , i ’d put money on it .			1

why would someone as pretty @entity2 change her face ?
she does n’t look like @entity2
