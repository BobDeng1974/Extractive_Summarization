a restaurant diner made a cringing gaffe when she took a bite out of a $ 750 white @entity5 truffle that had been on display			1
despite the fact that the valuable fungi was under a glass dome in the entryway of @entity12 in @entity13 , it seems the unnamed woman confused the arrangement with a free sample offering			1
the diner took a silver dollar - sized nibble before discarding the rest of the truffle on her bread plate			2
she says she only realized what had happened when she clocked the half - eaten truffle while walking across the dining room			2
she told @entity42 that she politely approached the diner , who was ' indignant about it			2
she had n't a clue as to what a truffle really was ! ' the diner even told mrs @entity31 that the taste of the truffle was not even to her liking			1
fine dining : @entity13 restaurant @entity12 ( pictured ) had put the truffles on display to celebrate a promotion that allowed customers to add truffle shavings to their vegan brunch for a $ 20 surcharge the restaurateur salvaged the remaining truffle and took it to her chef husband , @entity64 , with whom she co-owns the restaurant			1
' i took it over to @entity64 and showed him , and he said , " that 's a $ 300 bite ! " she told the @entity69			0
luckily for the unwitting customer , she was not charged for her mistake			0
' it was one of the costs we had to eat , literally , ' mrs @entity31 said			0
chef @entity31 , whose restaurant is a block from the @entity77 and the first president @entity78 dined at after he was elected , told @entity42 that the rare truffles are best served on silky pasta , eggs and wild mushrooms			0
recipe for success : chef @entity64 and his wife @entity86 , whose restaurant is a block from the @entity77 , told us that the rare truffles are best served on silky pasta , eggs and wild mushrooms @entity91 truffles are more valuable than black or summer truffles because they are rare and can only be harvested in october and november			0
chefs value them for their unique flavor and creamy , marbled flesh			0
most are sourced from northern and central @entity97 though they can also be found in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
