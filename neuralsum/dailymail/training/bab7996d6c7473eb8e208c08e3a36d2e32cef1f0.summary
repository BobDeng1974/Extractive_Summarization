by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:48 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 17:22 est , 1 june 2013 unwanted exposure : @entity3 in the @entity5 flyer , which was shot three years ago but has resurfaced a lingerie company called @entity5 is circulating an early modelling picture of prince @entity10 ’s girlfriend @entity3 , taken three years ago			1
the @entity11 can exclusively reveal the photograph of the @entity10 ’s 24 - year - old girlfriend modelling a green and white floral bikini for the upmarket company owned by three of her friends – @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity21 flirted with the idea of becoming a model and it is understood she offered to help her friends by posing for this photo in 2010 , long before she entered into a romance with prince @entity10			1
friends of @entity21 , now an aspiring dancer studying at @entity31 school in @entity32 , say she will be disappointed that the photograph is back in circulation			1
one close friend said : ‘ she is especially sensitive to exposure at the moment – she totally wants to avoid the limelight			2
’ friends say that @entity21 ’s sudden rise to fame after being linked to @entity10 last summer could be the motivation behind the decision to resurrect the photograph from the cutting - room floor			1
the bikini she is modelling is no longer sold on the website owned by the three founders – who were all at @entity54 together at the same time that @entity21 was at @entity56			0
@entity20 told @entity11 : ‘ that photo was taken a long time ago			1
@entity21 does n’t model for us any more			0
i do n’t think she will really want the publicity from it			0
’ nevertheless , last week the photograph of a waif - like @entity21 , then aged 21 , was being circulated on promotional flyers for the brand , which was founded in 2009			2
the flyer reads : ‘ this card entitles you to 30 per cent off all @entity5 collections ’ , although the style @entity21 is wearing is no longer on sale on the website			2
last week the flyers were being handed out in goody bags at a party in @entity74 hosted by another of @entity21 ’s friends , @entity76 , when she launched a collection of silk jackets for her fashion brand @entity80			0
@entity21 was due to appear at the party but made a last - minute decision not to go			2
a friend at the event said : ‘ @entity84 has now quietly hired an adviser to help navigate her way through all the attention surrounding her			0
she does n’t want to be photographed at events right now			0
young love : prince @entity10 and the aspiring dancer were pictured sharing an intimate moment on a ski - ing break in @entity94 earlier this year ‘ she was very hurt and saddened by pictures of her drinking shots which emerged recently in a magazine , which were unfairly compared to @entity100 , who is a family friend			1
it was incredibly embarrassing and cruel			0
she was at university – who does n’t drink shots at university ? ’ another friend added : ‘ whether it works out between them or not , @entity10 will always adore @entity21 and he is very protective of her			1
he would have been mortified that such a cheap comparison was made			0
’ and now it seems that by digging up the picture of @entity21 in a bikini , her friends have increased the attention surrounding her			2
the silk underwear sold on the website , and in 19 @entity119 concessions , is hand - made in @entity120 , and a set costs about £ 85			2
upmarket : the @entity5 lingerie company website shows a model stretched out in a two piece other celebrities to model for the company include made in @entity129 ’s @entity128 and tv presenter @entity130			0
a blog on the @entity5 website , written by @entity20 in 2011 , reads : ‘ @entity18 and i got a tour of the entire factory , including where they keep the silk cocoons before opening them and making them into fibres , the silk reems [ sic ] , the dyeing room , and the sewing rooms where our @entity5 come to life ! ’ ambassadors : @entity148 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) have modeled for the lingerie company the ‘ prince @entity10 effect ’ worked wonders for the modelling career of his previous girlfriend , @entity152 , who landed a lucrative contract with @entity119 handbag designer @entity155 shortly after their brief fling fizzled out in august 2011			1
she also fronted a campaign for underwear label @entity162			0
@entity21 ’s mother is @entity165 , 66 , who was a society it girl in her time			0
she was married to @entity21 ’s father , @entity169 – chairman of old - fashioned haberdashers @entity171 & @entity172 – for six years .			1

@entity3 , now an aspiring dancer posed for picture three years ago
