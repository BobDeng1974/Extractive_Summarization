regardless of religious beliefs , many people attempt to meditate at busy times in their lives			0
and now a new study claims that meditation activates parts of the brain that simple ‘ relaxing ’ can not			2
people who meditate process more ideas and feelings than when they are just resting and letting your mind wander is more effective than concentrating on emptying your head of thoughts , scientists said			1
focus : the experts discovered that letting your mind wander is more effective than concentrating on emptying your head of thoughts when meditating			1
the left images show the brain during concentrative meditation , while images to the right show the brain during nondirective meditation researchers from @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , believe their findings - published in the journal frontiers in @entity35 - suggest that meditation is more than just a way to lower stress			1
there are countless techniques such as @entity41 , @entity42 and transcendental meditation and these can be divided into two main groups known as ‘ concentrative ’ meditation where the person focuses on breathing and specific thoughts and ‘ nondirective ’ which allows the mind to wander as it pleases			1
all the participants in the study had experience with a nondirective form of meditation practiced in @entity32 called @entity54			1
relax : experts from @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , used mri scanners to look at brain activity during meditations			1
they found that the brain processes more thoughts and feelings during meditation than when people are simply relaxing scientists have shown that a mere seven hours of brain training can make humans kinder and more likely to help those in need			1
@entity69 researchers have discovered that training people to be more compassionate actually changes their brains			2
scientists at the @entity73 at the @entity74 used compassion mediation – an ancient @entity42 technique to increase caring feelings for people who are suffering – in their experiment			2
people who had compassion training were compared to a control group that learned cognitive reappraisal , which is a technique where people learn to reframe their thoughts to feel less negative			2
the researchers then looked at whether people became more altruistic			0
participants in the experiment played a game on the internet in which they were given the opportunity to spend their own money in order to help out someone in need			0
lead author @entity98 said : ‘ we found that people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically to help someone who was treated unfairly than those who were trained in cognitive reappraisal			0
’ compassion training also increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the extent to which it communicated with the nucleus accumbens , which are brain regions involved in emotion regulation and the production of positive emotions , mri scans revealed			1
compassion , like physical and academic skills , appears to be something that is not fixed , but rather can be enhanced with training and practice			0
using an mri scanner , the experiment showed that the part of their brains dedicated to processing self - related thoughts and feelings were more active during the activity than at rest			1
when test subjects performed concentrative meditation , the activity in this part of the brain was almost the same as when they were just resting			1
dr @entity133 , of @entity30 , said : ‘ i was surprised the activity of the brain was greatest when the person ’s thoughts wandered freely on their own , rather than when the brain worked to be more strongly focused			1
‘ when the subjects stopped doing a specific task and were not really doing anything special , there was an increase in activity in the area of the brain where we process thoughts and feelings			2
‘ it is described as a kind of resting network			0
and it was this area that was most active during nondirective meditation			0
’ professor @entity155 , of the @entity156 , said : ‘ the study indicates nondirective meditation allows for more room to process memories and emotions than during concentrated meditation			2
‘ this area of the brain has its highest activity when we rest			0
it represents a kind of basic operating system ; a resting network that takes over when external tasks do not require our attention			0
‘ it is remarkable a mental task like nondirective meditation results in even higher activity in this network than regular rest			0
’ professor @entity155 is the only member of the research team to regularly meditate and he believes that good research depends on having a team that can combine personal experience of meditation with a critical attitude towards results			0
‘ meditation is an activity practiced by millions of people			1
it is important we find out how this really works , ’ he added .			0

letting your mind wander is more effective than concentrating on emptying your head of thoughts , scientists said
researchers from @entity30 in @entity31 and the @entity156 used mri scanners to look at brain activity during meditations
concentrating on ' nothing ' is only as effective as resting
meditation is practiced by millions of people but little is known about how it works
