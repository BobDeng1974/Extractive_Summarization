by @entity0 and @entity1 education secretary @entity2 is said to be delighted at his daughter securing a place at a state school @entity2 has chosen a state secondary school for his daughter			1
@entity7 , 10 , has secured a place at a popular @entity10 girls ’ comprehensive at the heart of @entity12 - her first choice school			1
mr @entity2 is believed to be the first conservative education secretary to choose a state secondary for his child			0
the minister and his wife , @entity17 , a @entity18 columnist , are said to be ‘ delighted ’ their daughter will go to the @entity21			1
founded in 1698 , the school specialises in the teaching of languages and encourages first year pupils to learn at least two , with the option of studying @entity27 and @entity28			1
judged ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity32 in 2009 , the school , which has strong links with @entity31 , is typically at least five times oversubscribed for its 150 places			1
it places pupils in ability bands to allocate places as well as prioritising church - going families			0
the uniform at the school includes a grey coat , as the name suggests , costing between £ 65 and £ 85			2
according to the 2009 report , two - thirds of pupils are from ethnic minority backgrounds and one third speak @entity47 as a second language			0
unlike his predecessors as @entity2 and several other leading @entity50 , mr @entity2 was determined to send his children to a state school			1
@entity53 , general secretary of the @entity54 , said : ' we would suggest that all cabinet ministers follow mr @entity2 's example and send their children to one of the country 's many fine state schools			1
' writing in her column today , @entity62 said : ' i want to support the state sector not just because , as a @entity67 taxpayer and a tight - wad , i would resent paying twice for my children ’s education			2
' or because , having watched my friends go through the hell of trying to get their offspring into high - flying private schools , i decided to spare mine the anguish			0
“ but mostly because i believe that at state school @entity7 will receive a far more comprehensive education - in every sense of the phrase - than at any private establishment			2
in a speech earlier this year at the @entity83 , he lauded a ‘ renaissance ’ in state education , insisting many schools state schools were as good as , if not better than , some in the private sector			0
while the @entity2 's were successful in securing their first choice school , others were not so lucky			1
more than four in ten children in some areas were denied their preferred secondary school amid mounting competition for places @entity96 , daughter of @entity17 and @entity2 , will be attending state school , @entity97 tens of thousands of ten and 11 - year - olds found they had missed out as allocations were announced by councils across the country			1
many areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice schools			1
the allocations to more than half a million families are likely to see a surge in appeals			0
law firm @entity115 warned the system can be a ‘ minefield ’ for parents			0
research by the @entity18 shows a booming population in many towns and cities is fuelling rising demand for secondary places			0
in @entity83 , where the demand for secondary school places rose 5 per cent in a year , 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice school – up slightly on last year			1
this rose to 42 per cent in the boroughs of @entity12 and @entity133 & @entity134 and 41 per cent in @entity135			0
in @entity138 , the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 per cent , leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013			1
popular : the @entity141 in @entity142 is an oversubscribed grammar - 1,863 boys applied for just 160 places ‘ the rise in reception pupil numbers seen in 2007/08 is starting to filter through to secondary schools			0
' there has also been general population growth in the area , ’ said a spokesman			0
in @entity153 , where applications also rose , 30 per cent were rejected by their first choice – up from 26 per cent			2
@entity157 , meanwhile , was unable to offer places to 22 per cent			0
around one in seven youngsters are expected to miss out on first choice schools			2
under the admissions system , parents list their school preferences			2
they are then allocated places according to the schools ’ admissions criteria , which are mainly based on a family ’s proximity			0
other factors can include random lotteries or ability banding – measures aimed at preventing middle - class parents playing the system by moving into catchment areas			2
banding involves all pupils being tested , with a set number of bright , average and low ability children admitted			2
competition is particularly intense for places at grammar and faith schools , as well as flagship free schools and academies , which are funded by the taxpayer but free from local government interference			0
@entity141 in @entity142 upon @entity188 , @entity189 , saw 1,863 boys sitting the 11 - plus test , competing for 160 places			0
the @entity193 , in @entity133 , had nearly 10 applicants for each of its 120 places the @entity193 , founded by journalist @entity197 , had 1,124 applications for 120 places			1
@entity200 , senior director of @entity201 , said : ‘ most people are happy with a good school , they do n’t necessarily want an outstanding school , but if there is n’t one in your area then you have a problem			2
‘ there are areas where schools are still failing			2
’ a @entity214 spokesman said : ‘ every parent deserves the chance to send their child to a good school			0
‘ the number of children in failing secondary schools has already fallen by a quarter of a million since 2010			0
’ parents apply to a local authority for a place for their child each year , and those wanting a place at a secondary school for september 2014 had to apply by 31 october last year			1
depending on where they live , families will either find out today or tomorrow where their child has been allocated a place			0
the schools set their own admissions criteria and admissions are dealt with by the local authority			0
for example , faith schools give preference to children who practise the religion of the school , while others may prioritise those with siblings already at the school or those who do well in an entrance exam			1
for some , study alone will not be enough - and their parents will have to appeal the school 's decision ( file image ) parents may list up to a certain number of schools in order of preference on their application form - in @entity83 boroughs with larger numbers of schools that can mean up to six schools , while in other areas they may be allowed to list a smaller number - for example , parents in @entity138 can list a maximum of three			1
unlike with primary schools , where catchment areas are all - important and house prices go up as a result , where you live is not usually as important a factor in most secondary applications			0
there is no guarantee that children will be offered a place at their first or even third choice school - some will be offered a place at a school they did not apply to and have no wish to go to			1
there is a deadline date of 17 march ( in most local authority areas ) for parents to respond to the offer they are given , either to accept the school place offered or to appeal a decision or place a child on a waiting list			1
places become available at schools when parents decide to send their child to a private school , look elsewhere for schools or to home - educate their children instead			1
parents who have appealed a school 's decision not to offer their child a place will have their appeal heard by an independent panel			1
they will first check your child meets all the school 's admissions criteria , and should come back to you with a decision within a week .			0
