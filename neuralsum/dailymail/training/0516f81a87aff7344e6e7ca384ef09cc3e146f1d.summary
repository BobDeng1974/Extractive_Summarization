@entity1 ’s patience with his arch - critic snapped at @entity3 on thursday ahead of the decisive second test against @entity5 when he accused @entity6 of making personal attacks on him and his @entity9 captaincy			1
the @entity10 has seemingly had it in for @entity1 ever since he called his 294 against @entity12 at @entity13 three years ago ‘ boring ’ but he cranked up his criticism of the @entity9 captain this winter and throughout last week ’s first test			1
and @entity1 responded to persistent negative comments from @entity6 on @entity18 and in his newspaper column about his tactics and the timing of his declaration against @entity5 at @entity23 by saying ‘ something needs to be done			1
’ hitting back : @entity1 has criticised @entity10 pundit @entity6 for ' personal attacks ' outspoken : @entity18 pundit @entity6 has been vocal in his criticism of @entity1 's captaincy in recent months tactics : @entity1 ( left ) discusses strategy with @entity9 coach @entity31 during training at @entity3 under pressure : @entity1 's captaincy came under criticism in the first test against @entity5 at @entity36 's last week nets : @entity9 practise at @entity3 ahead of the second test with @entity5 which starts on friday @entity1 refused to bite when asked about @entity6 and other criticism in his press conference ahead of friday 's second @entity42 but was more forthcoming in a radio interview with the @entity46 ’s @entity45			1
‘ something needs to be done because in my eyes i ’ve been criticised for a hell of a lot of my three years as captain , ’ said @entity1 when asked for his response to ‘ voluble ’ remarks , in particular from @entity6			1
‘ yes , when you lose as captain you get criticised but i ’ve also won a lot for @entity9			2
i ’ve won more one - day games than any other @entity9 captain , i ’ve won an @entity59 and away in @entity12			1
i ’m proud of that , so to be criticised for three years i find quite hard to take to be honest			0
‘ support and positivity is what this @entity9 team need			2
the crowd at @entity23 were brilliant , the public there were fantastic and got behind the lads			0
a bit more support like that would stand everyone in good stead			0
’ did @entity1 believe the criticism was personal ? ‘ yes i think it is , ’ he said			2
but would a century in @entity76 silence the noises off ? ‘ it probably would n’t which is sad but hopefully for the good of this @entity9 side it would			0
’ there is no question to this observer that @entity6 , a close friend and confidante of @entity10 captain @entity86 and an ally of @entity88 , has been harsh and relentless in his attacks on @entity1 but whether the @entity9 captain should have responded in this way at this time is questionable			1
up and down : @entity1 looks frustrated during the first @entity39 ( left ) but was smiling in training before the second friend : @entity18 pundit @entity6 ( left ) is close with @entity97 captain @entity86 ( right ) strategy : @entity31 ( second left ) talks with @entity99 ( left ) and @entity9 's other players during training video new look line up impressing so far - @entity1 @entity1 can only stoke up the fire and increase the pressure on himself by responding to @entity6 and would have been better off ignoring a man who is undoubtedly one of the greatest of all cricketers but to my mind at least is a one - eyed and repetitive commentator			1
quite what @entity1 feels can be done to stop @entity6 is not clear but he can not expect to silence or censor a pundit who is paid to give his views			2
unfortunately , the deportation of voluble @entity10 is beyond the power even of an @entity9 captain or an @entity117 chairman in @entity118 who complained to @entity18 about @entity6 ’s attacks on @entity1 after the disastrous @entity59 winter			1
other than @entity6 and perhaps a couple of other observers @entity1 and the new @entity9 have actually received a lot of support from the bulk of the media and there were far more positive assessments of the @entity36 ’s performance by @entity9 and the tactics of their captain than negative ones			1
it is certainly laughable for those who have called on @entity1 to stand up as an @entity9 captain and do the job his way to now say he should be picking the brains of those in the commentary box who would seek to undermine him			1
venue : @entity3 will host the second test between @entity9 and @entity5 which starts on friday hitting out : @entity99 bats in the nets at @entity3 ahead of the second test against @entity5 catch : @entity144 dives to grab the ball as @entity9 prepare ahead of the second test with @entity5 cool : @entity147 looks calm as he waits to catch the ball during a nets session at @entity3 with @entity9 @entity1 said yesterday that the man outside of the @entity9 set - up who he turns to for advice is former @entity9 captain and @entity155 columnist @entity154 and it is absolutely his prerogative to seek opinions from where he wants to rather than pander to @entity6 just because he has been a critic of him			1
‘ everyone will have different views on how to get results and i ’m doing it the way that feels right to me on the pitch , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ we keep things in house but i spoke to @entity154 the other day not just about captaincy but all sorts of things			0
he is a good friend of mine and made some good points			0
' at the end of the day i feel we did a very good job at @entity23 without quite getting over the line and if we continue to play like that i will be proud as @entity9 captain			2
’ what @entity1 needs most of all to repel @entity6 ’s near unplayable deliveries is to score his first test century since he last played here at @entity3 against @entity183 just over a year ago			1
and the @entity9 captain knows it			2
huddle : @entity9 players and coaching staff take time during training to talk through their strategy @entity191 ball : @entity9 's @entity192 runs with an @entity10 rules ' ball during training ahead of the second test bowling : @entity9 paceman @entity196 ( left ) and spinner @entity197 ( right ) during training at @entity3 ' it ’s crucial i score runs as captain so i need to get back to getting as many as i can , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i am doing the hard work			0
i ’ve just got to score in the middle			0
' i think this run is different to the poor form i had a few years ago because back then i did n’t know where the next run was coming from			0
the difference now is that i have n’t been converting starts to hundreds and that ’s frustrating			0
’ @entity5 want to complete a tour that has seen them win the @entity216 international and one - day series with a victory that would give them their first test series win in @entity9			2
@entity1 knows they will be tough opponents again but hopes the @entity3 pitch will have more pace , bounce and carry than @entity36 ’s			2
‘ we played really well at @entity23 but that ’s gone , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ we have to earn the right to again get in the positions we got into there			0
eventually we dominated @entity5 but it took us four and a half days of really hard work to do so			0
' yes we desperately want to win this test and to do so we will need to play good cricket			0
’ and if they do maybe even @entity6 will be impressed			0
focused : @entity5 captain @entity232 is ready to face @entity9 in the second test at @entity3 smash : @entity5 's @entity235 hits a shot during a net session at @entity3 ahead of the second test poised : @entity5 's @entity238 readies himself to catch a ball during a nets session at @entity3 suited : @entity232 in his full cricket gear leaves the nets following a session before the second test			1

the @entity9 captain *insists* ' something needs to be done ' to quieten @entity6
