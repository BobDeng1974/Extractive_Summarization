the revelation came as @entity10 prosecutors said their request to appeal the athlete 's manslaughter conviction and five - year prison sentence would be heard on december 9			1
the runner had hoped he would qualify for home detention curfew with a tag after serving just ten months of his sentence			1
but @entity19 can reveal that prison bosses have told him he ca n't take part in their tagging scheme because the device can not be properly monitored if it is fixed to a prosthetic leg			1
