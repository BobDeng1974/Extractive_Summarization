@entity25 have your bank details and my bank details , but they do n't share that			2
neither party needs the other 's information			0
‘ that is the thinking behind it - a nice , convenient way of doing that i 'm not totally sure what the mechanism of linking is			0
i rather suspect that like the phone number they 're just using it is an as an identifier			2
’ asked if he felt the system was safe for customers , mr @entity111 said : ‘ if all we 're talking about here is that an identifier then i do n't see why not			0
‘ i ’m using the @entity4 handle as a hanger on which i 'm paying the money to you			2
i ca n’t see there is any additional risk			0
’ he added : ‘ if we 're talking about a mechanism that is linking my bank account details to my @entity4 settings , then it 's something else , but i do n't think we 're talking about that			2

everyone has a phone number , but for many people , especially young people , @entity4 is a more ready - to - hand identifier			1
