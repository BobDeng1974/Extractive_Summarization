the current student loans system under which graduates only start repayments when they earn more than £ 21,000 is unsustainable , according to a leading economist			1
the threshold for paying back student loans was increased from £ 15,000 to £ 21,000 in 2012			0
but professor @entity6 said the system costs the taxpayer too much			1
the academic , from the @entity9 , suggested lowering the threshold to £ 18,000 , or at the very minimum ensuring that the current threshold is not linked to inflation			2
cost of an education : a leading economist warns that the current system of student finance through loans is unsustainable and that graduates need to start repaying their debts sooner he said the move would help to ensure that degree courses remain high quality and that everyone , including those from poorer backgrounds , have a fair chance of going to university			1
speaking at a conference on the future of tuition fees , the professor praised some elements of the @entity34 ’s higher education reforms , including tripling tuition fees to a maximum of £ 9,000 a year and raising interest rates on student loans ‘ to something approximating the government ’s cost of borrowing ’			2
but he said the system was still too expensive and therefore student numbers risk being capped			1
he added that his proposal would help to ensure the cost of loans does not outweigh the funding to universities – in turn ensuring that degree courses remain high quality and that everyone , including those from poorer backgrounds , have a fair chance of going to university			2
he said : ‘ what was good about the 2012 reforms was raising the fees cap , raising the interest rate on student loans to something approximating the government ’s cost of borrowing			2
‘ what was bad was abolishing taxpayer ’s support for the arts , humanities and social sciences , which pre-supposes that those subjects have no social benefits			1
@entity6 : he praised some the tripling tuition of tuition fees to a maximum of £ 9,000 a year and raising interest rates on student loans ' i think it is generally agreed that higher education has significant private benefits but it also has social benefits , so the cost should be shared			1
’ in 2012 , the interest rate of student loans was raised roughly in line with the cost of borrowing , and graduates began to repay money when they were earning £ 21,000 , up from £ 15,000 , with repayments linked to wages			0
‘ that is unsustainable , ’ prof @entity6 said			0
‘ in the 2006 system , the interest subsidy made loans fiscally expensive leading eventually to a cap on student numbers			1
' the 2012 reforms fixed the problem but loans continued to be fiscally expensive because of the increase in the repayment threshold			0
' so the new system creates the same problem , the numbers cap or upward pressure on public spending for the same reason - the high cost of loans			2
’ he added : ‘ if the fact that loans are fiscally expensive means student numbers are capped that compromises the objective of size			1
' if student numbers are capped then student loans over time , the fiscal cost of loans will crowd out the income going to universities , which puts quality at risk , and in terms of access heavily subsided loans are a really bad way of trying to widen participation			1
' it ’s spending money that ought to be spent widening participation on the wrong things			0
‘ so what needs to happen is to make the loans system sustainable , that means you need to reduce the fiscal cost			0
that means the threshold needs to come down , one way or another			0
’ access : but he said the system was still too expensive and therefore student numbers risk being capped professor @entity6 's suggestion is the reverse of a concession made to the @entity150 when tuition fees were raised in 2012 , when it was agreed that the threshold would rise with inflation each year			1
@entity155 is widely expected to outline its policy on tuition fees shortly , and @entity158 recently hinted that he would pledge a reduction in tuition fees from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000			0
however , he has faced a backlash from university leaders , who have questioned how the funding shortfall would be plugged			0
at the weekend , shadow business secretary @entity164 said the process to agree the policy had been difficult partly because the @entity167 is ‘ determined not to repeat the mistake of @entity169 ’ and make a promise in their manifesto which they can not keep .			0

@entity9 professor @entity6 warns the current system is too expensive
student numbers could be capped if more funding is *n't* found , he says
high fees , he claims , actually help poorer students make it to university
and he says taxpayer must support arts , humanities and social sciences
