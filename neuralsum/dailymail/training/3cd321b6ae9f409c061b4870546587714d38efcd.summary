a disabled man who is in a vegetative state must be kept alive for as long as possible so he can have a ' good ' @entity3 death , his wife has pleaded			2
she told the @entity6 her 55 - year - old husband responds to family visiting the hospital in @entity10 and enjoyed smelling some perfume ' brought from @entity12 ' despite his severe brain damage			1
the man , who can only be referred to as @entity15 , had a heart attack last month and the @entity17 has applied for an order allowing it not to resuscitate if his condition deteriorates further			1
' responsive ' : the condition 55 - year - old man who was in a ' vegetative state ' has improved dramatically overnight , it was claimed today his wife , however , told a judge that her husband had ' sniffed ' the perfume and reacts to touch			1
the family argue that it would be contrary to the religious beliefs of @entity15 , who suffered a cardiac arrest in @entity32 , not to do all that could be done to keep him living for as long as possible			1
pleading for doctors to continue doing all they can to save him , his wife of 40 years told the court today he has shown active signs of life			2
speaking through an interpreter , the mother - of - eight criticised the quality of care her husband has received from hospital staff			0
@entity17 , which is based in @entity46 , is seeking a court declaration that it would not be in his best interests to offer him ventilation or resuscitation if there was ' a life - threatening event '			2
religious beliefs : the man 's wife said he was able to ' sniff ' perfume brought back from @entity12 , pictured @entity58 , appearing for the @entity17 , said it was the unanimous view of clinicians treating @entity15 , as well as independent experts , that he was in a persistent vegetative state ' with minimal prospects of improving any neurological function and no meaningful prospect of further recovery '			1
ms @entity58 told mr @entity68 , sitting in the @entity69 in @entity70 , that treatment would lead to ' the prolongation of death and lack of dignity '			0
but mrs @entity76 said her husband was ' a very good @entity3 ' and had said he wanted ' a good death in line with his faith ' - and that involved prolonging life ' for as long as you can '			1
@entity82 , appearing for mrs l , asked her why she disagreed with the doctors ' diagnosis that he was in a vegetative state and incapable of any meaningful response to anyone or his environment			0
mrs @entity76 said that on occasions when the family visits him , her husband ' takes a deep breath and is aware that someone is there '			0
mrs @entity76 described how she had visited her husband on the day of @entity94 , following the conclusion of @entity96 at the weekend			0
she said through the interpreter : ' i took a scarf and there was perfume he ( mr l ) himself had brought from @entity12 , so i put it on that scarf			2
' then we put the scarf in his hands and we felt like somebody is having a sniff , and he took a sniff of it			0
' it is true sometimes he does not realise what is happening , but sometimes he does			0
