@entity1 gov. @entity0 will carefully avoid the media during his trip to the @entity4 , on the heels of @entity9 gov. @entity8 's disastrous @entity7 swing a week ago			1
he is scheduled to have a private meeting with @entity4 prime minister @entity11 on tuesday , but unlike @entity8 he will not take questions from the media while he 's overseas			1
@entity14 asked his press secretary , @entity15 , about interview opportunities and press conferences ; she said neither would occur			1
' unfortunately , the governor 's schedule is extremely tight , ' @entity21 said , ' so we will not be able to accommodate ( you )			2
' no questions : @entity1 gov. @entity0 is preparing a presidential run , but wo n't speak to journalists in @entity7 during a trade mission there no immunity : @entity9 gov. @entity8 had a few rough days in the @entity4 last week after he started a national freak - out over childhood vaccines ' this is an official trip and the purpose of the trade mission is to promote foreign direct investment in @entity1 , so it is vital that we keep the governor 's planned schedule			1
' she said before @entity0 left that the journey would be ' a business trip , not a photo op. ' @entity0 is on an official state government trade mission until friday , traveling with a group of @entity1 government and business officials			1
but the trip will also give @entity0 a crucial chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016			2
@entity8 's stock took a nose dive in the @entity4 when he started a national furor over childhood immunizations after he was asked whether parents should have their children vaccinated			1
the news story quickly gathered momentum , with other potential presidential candidates being asked whether they believed – as @entity8 suggested – that parents should be allowed to opt out			2
' parents need to have some measure of choice , ' he said			0
' so that 's the balance that the government has to decide			0
' @entity8 ended up canceling his final @entity4 press conferences rather than endure more questions			1
a @entity71 panel held a hearing on tuesday about the vaccine controversy			0
@entity0 will also deliver a speech at the prestigious @entity75 think tank on wednesday about the global economy			0
his @entity7 trip is the third trade mission he has conducted since he took office in 2011 , following visits to @entity82 and @entity83			1
he has also said he is planning to visit @entity84 this year			0
presidential timber ? @entity0 is carefully establishing his foreign policy bona fides , knowing that governors are usually thought of only in terms of domestic policy ' governors running for president need to show they have developed some foreign policy expertise since their jobs keep them at home most of the time , ' @entity90 , the director of the @entity91 at the @entity92 , told @entity99 on monday			1
' voters know governors understand domestic issues , but half a president 's job is coping with the complexities of global crises , ' he said			0
' candidates ca n't be caught flat - footed on the trail and in debates when international topics are raised			0
getting briefed by experts is one thing , seeing leaders abroad is quite another – and then the candidates can sprinkle their comments with first - hand experiences			0
' other potential @entity117 presidential hopefuls have paid recent visits to @entity7			0
@entity120 gov. @entity119 was there in january as part of a 10 - day trade mission across @entity124			2
he made news by pointing out that there are @entity127 - dominated ' no - go zones ' in @entity129 where police do n't keep law and order			0
then - @entity134 gov. @entity133 , former @entity136 gov. @entity135 and @entity138 sen. @entity137 went last year			0
@entity139 , the former secretary of state who is the @entity141 ' front - runner , had a @entity7 stop during her book tour in the summer of 2014			2
the @entity4 is @entity1 's sixth largest export market ; the state sends nearly $ 700 million worth of products to @entity147 each year			1
@entity1 imported about $ 290 million in goods from the @entity4 in 2013 .			2

@entity1 governor plans no press conferences in the @entity4 and his *handlers* are n't allowing *reporters* to interview him
he 's in @entity7 on a trade mission representing his state government
last week @entity9 gov. @entity8 *crashed* and *burned* as he tried to establish foreign policy bona fides
after starting a controversy over vaccines , @entity8 canceled his final press conferences rather than face questions from an *aggressive* @entity4 press
