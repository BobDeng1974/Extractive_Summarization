@entity0 have attacked the @entity2 watchdog for delaying the release of a report into the collapse of @entity6 until after the @entity7			1
the findings will expose the disastrous blunders of former bank executives , regulators , as well as politicians			2
but they will now not be published until the summer at the earliest – nearly seven years since @entity6 imploded after years of reckless lending , triggering a £ 20billion bail out from the taxpayer			1
bailed out : @entity17 needed a £ 20billion handout from the taxpayers to stay afloat after years of reckless lending and investments led to its near collapse during the banking crisis nearly seven years ago business secretary @entity24 described the delay as ‘ totally unsatisfactory ’			1
it comes after sir @entity27 said his report into the @entity29 will not be published until after may , winning a reprieve for figures in the @entity33 establishment who are expected to be heavily criticised			2
the @entity36 findings , like the @entity6 report , are understood to have been held up by those likely to be criticised by the inquiry and who have used lawyers to defend themselves			1
a section of the report will conclude whether the @entity44 should take action against individuals including disgraced former @entity6 executives @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 – all of whom were let off the hook by its predecessor the @entity55			1
this part of the probe is being carried out by @entity58 , who was hired last summer after mps raised concerns about the independence of the regulator ’s findings			0
only one former executive , @entity64 , has been punished for his role in the downfall of @entity6 , which was saved from collapse in september 2008 , while @entity68 was bailed out weeks later			1
more than 46,000 staff have lost their jobs and @entity68 is still 25 per cent owned by taxpayers			0
mr @entity64 , who ran @entity73 ’s corporate division , was fined £ 500,000 in 2012 and received a lifetime ban from the @entity2 for presiding over a reckless lending spree which ultimately led to £ 26billion of losses			0
he has described it as ‘ sinister and curious ’ that he was ‘ singled out ’ while others escaped punishment			0
let off the hook : but disgraced former @entity6 executives @entity49 , left , and @entity48 , right , may still face action based on the recommendations of the latest report into their conduct ahead of the bank crash the formal investigation into @entity6 ’s downfall was launched by the @entity55 in september 2012 after its enforcement probe into individuals at the lender was finally completed			1
it was meant to be published the following year			0
but the @entity44 – which replaced the @entity55 in april 2013 – moved the deadline to the end of last year			1
the latest delay is thought to stem partly from a process known as ‘ @entity97 ’ – named after the late newspaper tycoon @entity98 – whereby those criticised can challenge what is written about them			0
the political sensitivity of the report is thought to be another reason why it will not emerge until after the election			2
it is expected to increase scrutiny on top figures in the @entity110 , including former prime minister and chancellor @entity112 , who has been blamed for fostering the ‘ light touch ’ regulation that enabled banks to take huge gambles and behave with impunity			0
his key advisers when he was in the @entity120 included @entity110 leader @entity121 and shadow chancellor @entity122			0
the legal wrangling has dragged on since the autumn of 2013 , contributing to the spiralling cost of the inquiry , which is expected to top £ 1million , including £ 228,000 for legal advice for regulators criticised in the report			2
last night mr @entity24 said : ‘ we are now more than six years on from the banking crisis			2
the people whose livelihoods have been wrecked by the irresponsible behaviour at @entity6 and other banks deserve better than this			1
’ he added : ‘ holding up this report prevents us from making judgement on whether there has been wrongdoing and fraud and whether more former executives need to be punished			2
’ @entity144 mp @entity143 , who sits on the @entity145 , said : ‘ @entity146 seems to have become a standard excuse for delay and inactivity on so many levels			0
but the @entity44 has run out of excuses			1
it is vital we hear the truth as soon as possible			0
’ @entity154 , a @entity120 spokesman , said : ‘ we want this report to be published as soon as possible			2
nobody will take any lectures from the @entity158 when they repeatedly complained the last government was too tough on regulation			0
’ the delay will be compounded by the fact the treasury committee has to see a final draft of the report			2
insiders believe there is virtually no chance the report will be ready before the committee is dissolved on march 30 , ahead of the may election			2
it may not reconvene until september			0
a spokesman for the @entity44 said : ‘ we are committed to publishing the report as soon as possible but the legal process of @entity146 is currently under way and this can take some time			1
’ facing criticism : @entity48 , left , and @entity49 @entity48 , 58 @entity181 @entity112 ’s favourite banker , the @entity182 was credited with transforming @entity6 into @entity184 ’s biggest mortgage lender			1
he was knighted in 2006 , quitting @entity6 shortly afterwards with a £ 580,000 - a - year pension			1
mr @entity112 appointed him as deputy chairman of the @entity55 the following year			0
but a 2013 report into @entity6 by the @entity189 described him as the ‘ architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster ’			1
he apologised , forfeited his knighthood and gave up a third of his pension			0
@entity49 , 47 a former boss of @entity198 , mr @entity49 was chief executive of @entity6 when it was bailed out			1
he was accused by the commission of being ‘ unable and unwilling to change course ’ , persisting with the reckless strategy established by his mentor mr @entity48			0
he is now reported to receive more than £ 500,000 a year as boss of bookmaker coral			0
@entity50 , 69 earned £ 815,000 a year as chairman of @entity6 from may 2001 until its downfall			1
he infuriated the commission with the claim that the collapse of @entity6 was not his fault because he was ‘ only there part time ’			1
he has close links to @entity110 and is a friend of former spin chief @entity217			0
he now runs a consultancy firm .			0
