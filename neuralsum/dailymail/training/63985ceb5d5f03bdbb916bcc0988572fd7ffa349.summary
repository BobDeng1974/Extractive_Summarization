if @entity1 leaves @entity2 for @entity3 he will be considered an expensive @entity5 flop true measure of a top coach like @entity8 or @entity9 is to find a lower - league gem and make him into a world beater like @entity13 or @entity14 @entity15 and @entity16 have a telepathic understanding that gives @entity18 a fighting chance at @entity20 less than three weeks before @entity21 was too tired to start for @entity18 in @entity22 , he was one of only a couple of regular members of the @entity25 starting @entity26 who had played the full 120 minutes of the @entity28 tie with @entity29 , and endured the draining nervous tension of a very lengthy penalty shootout			1
he has started all but one of his club 's games this season , and played the full 90 minutes in most of them			0
amid the inevitable finger - pointing and blaming that is going on , there is a very real problem facing @entity42 , and that is a teenager facing burnout two months into the season			2
no surprise that @entity25 wanted @entity21 left out in @entity22			1
the real test will come this saturday			0
nobody can be in any doubt that @entity21 will need to be given a few days off – including the weekend trip to his old club @entity70			2
coming up after that of course , it ’s a crucial double header with @entity74			0
@entity21 played a huge number of games last season , and then went to the @entity78 and played in all three of @entity18 ’s matches			1
@entity25 being without @entity80 now means the 19 - year - old is very much in demand			1
@entity42 has been keen to protect his prize asset @entity21 at @entity25 @entity21 is under pressure to be @entity25 's match winner following the departure of @entity80 ( left ) it ’s not just the physical effect of playing games , it ’s the level of expectation that may well be weighing heavy on his shoulders			1
if he were at @entity96 , or @entity74 , or @entity97 , the quality and depth of their squads would mean he would get a break			0
@entity42 does n’t have that luxury			0
the one time he left @entity21 out of the starting line - up this season , @entity25 lost at home to @entity103			1
with @entity80 gone , @entity21 is now the go - to guy when @entity25 need a match winner , a bit of magic , something special			1
not even @entity18 place that burden on him – @entity15 fills that role for the country he captains and his years of experience mean he can deal with it no problem			0
@entity21 played 120 minutes for @entity25 in their @entity28 tie with @entity29 in september @entity21 is one of @entity25 's bright young stars @entity21 was named @entity25 ’s young player of the year in may – he ’s too young for these kind of demands			1
that ’s surely contributed to his tiredness			0
he is n’t under pressure with @entity18 – @entity40 ’s side won their toughest qualifier in @entity125 , and have virtually won the group already			1
what makes a teenage footballer tired ? playing against @entity129 ? training before a game in @entity22 ? it 's more likely to be the pressure of playing week in , week out and having to produce star quality performances in the @entity5 and @entity134			1
@entity42 could have gone out and tried to sign a star after @entity80 left			2
but he chose instead to build a bigger squad , with players way below @entity80 's quality			0
that was @entity42 ' decision but it means now the pressure of being the man to replace @entity80 is n’t placed on @entity144 , @entity145 or @entity146			2
it has fallen on @entity56			0
is he old enough to cope with that pressure ? does he have that experience ? he ’s got the quality – that ’s not up for debate			0
but he is still developing and growing as a player , so the last thing he needs is to be used as some sort of pawn in the managerial mind games between @entity42 and @entity40			1
sure , @entity25 pay his wages and @entity42 has the right to pick whatever team he wants			2
but he also ca n’t ignore the fact that this teenage sensation is being overplayed			0
let ’s see if @entity21 starts at @entity164 .			0

@entity21 *complained* of being tired ahead of the game in @entity22
@entity21 is under pressure to be @entity25 's star man
the 19 - year - old is too young to be used as a pawn in a battle between @entity18 boss @entity40 and @entity25 manager @entity42
