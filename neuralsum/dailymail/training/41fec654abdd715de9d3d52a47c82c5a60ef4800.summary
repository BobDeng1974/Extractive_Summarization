by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 7 may 2013 @entity1 has apparently ditched his circular signature in favor of something much more befitting of the @entity6 treasury secretary			1
@entity1 , who was appointed to the post earlier this year , created a media stir when his autograph - a series of loops that look nothing like his name - was revealed as the one that would grace all @entity6 paper money			2
but last week , a document from the @entity18 showed @entity1 's signature to be legible , with a more pronounced ' j ' and ' @entity21 ' clarity : treasury secretary @entity1 's new signature was revealed in a @entity18 and @entity25 document last week loopy : @entity1 's old signature was just a series of circles that looked nothing like his name scrawl : president @entity33 joked that @entity1 's loopy signature could devalue the national currency at @entity1 's nomination in january the change was first noticed by the @entity38			1
it is not known whether @entity1 took any handwriting or calligraphy classes in order to improve his signature			0
the @entity44 did not immediately respond to an email from @entity46 for comment			0
when he was appointed to the post by @entity33 in january , even the president took a dig at @entity1 's scrawl			2
@entity33 joked that it he had considered abandoning @entity1 's nomination after learning of his illegible signature , and added that it could become an international embarrassment			1
he added : ' @entity1 assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the treasury			2
' money matters ? if @entity1 kept the old signature , it would have looked like this on the dollar bill @entity1 also poked fun at himself , saying that he and his predecessor , @entity69 , have both struggled with signage			1
he said that ' it was only yesterday that i discovered that we both share a common challenge with penmanship			0
' @entity69 also modified his signature to make it readable on currency			0
@entity1 , 57 , was managing director for @entity81 from july 2006 until the end of 2008 , when he joined the @entity33 administration as the president 's chief of staff			0
@entity44 officials told the @entity87 on tuesday that @entity1 still has time before providing his official signature for all of the nation 's currency , something that he is expected to do later this year			0
common problem : @entity1 wisecracked that he did not know that he shared a ' common challenge with outgoing treasury secretary @entity69 , left , who had a similarly bad signature old version : outgoing treasury secretary @entity69 used to have a signature like the one seen here improved : his signature , seen bottom right , showed his full name and was much more legible and controlled			1

report last week from the @entity18 showed treasury secretary @entity1 's signature to be much more pronounced
his old signature was a series of loops that looked nothing like his name
@entity1 and his predecessor , @entity69 , both struggled with penmanship
