like twerking , @entity2 and the horse - meat scandal , glamping is so last year			1
you can barely move for luxury ‘ camp ’ - sites where the ‘ tents ’ – if this is still the word – look and feel like a boudoir in the @entity8 during the reign of @entity10			2
but scarcely the ‘ @entity13 ’			0
meet the locals : @entity15 gets up close and personal with two new canine friends on his visit to @entity18 onwards , into the snowy middle distance : @entity18 is a great place to try a session of dog - sledding on the other hand , the ‘ @entity13 ’ comes with its downsides			1
for every dew - tipped sunrise , there is a tent collapse that leaves you howling in the dark , or a squirrel dive - bomb attack which has you cowering in a corner			2
so what do you do if you want a bit of both – a few creature comforts , but also a sense that you are away on a grand adventure ? @entity39 , the marvellous mind behind the @entity41 , thinks he has the answer			1
authentic but cosy : @entity15 stayed in a lavvu tent - an @entity45 tipi with creature comforts such as a log fire having cut his camping boots as a photographer and guide across @entity50 , he came up with the curveball idea of transplanting a traditional bush camping experience into his native environment of @entity18			1
the camp is situated a short drive from @entity57 airport – far enough into the north of @entity59 that , on arrival , i am greeted by a soon - to - be common sight : a spectacular , snow - blanketed village of the most idyllic , festive variety			1
throw in suitably @entity45 temperatures of -20 ° c , and the super-smiley faces of the locals who run the camp , and i am certain that i am about to enjoy the not - glamping - but - not - just camping experience i have been seeking			1
but first , we have to find the camp – which lurks in a place where no roads go			2
love match : @entity15 enjoys another moment with man 's best friend ( left ) , and admires an ice sculpture ( right ) after decking me out in the finest layered snow gear ( reindeer pelts come as standard ) , and warning me to keep an eye out for the area 's many moose , reindeer , lynx and - gulp - the occasional bear , i am encouraged to hop aboard a snowmobile			1
soon , we are barrelling along a narrow forest - blanketed snowpath into the night			2
as the wind picks up , a few more degrees freeze away , and my face begins to turn numb			0
then we break out of the trees and bounce onto a frozen lake lit only by bright starlight and full moon above			0
luckily for me ( and the fingertips to which i 've grown accustomed ) , we soon slow to a stop on the bank of a snow - clad island , and i spot the orange lights of the camp twinkling among the dense forestry			1
all paws forward : @entity15 headed out with a husky team - one of the must - do experiences of a trip to @entity18 sunshine on the frozen plains : there are few more majestic sights in @entity59 than a team of dogs in profile i am shown to my ‘ lavvu ’ tent - an @entity45 tipi complete with log fire , thick sleeping bag and sturdy bed			1
and a quick tour shows me the rest of the surprisingly eco-friendly camp – an indoor lounge ; a mercifully canvas - enveloped flushable toilet ; just a few other @entity124 tents , all set to a snooze - inducing 20 ° c ; solar - powered ground lamps to guide you along the paths at night			2
along with the camp ’s other new residents , i head out for a short session of staring upwards , hoping to spot the @entity131			1
then we retreat to the fire - warmed lounge and while away the night sharing travel stories with the camp 's endlessly fascinating guides			0
as we do so , we munch on dried moose , @entity45 char and @entity18 cheese , and slurp a combination of warm lingonberry juice and throat - embalming red wine			1
a pause for a breather : @entity15 exchanges travel tales - as the huskies also take time out from their wild efforts ice ice baby : @entity15 has his own attempt at creating an frosty sculpture - a little more practice required , possibly i trudge back to my tent and take a moment to soak up the serene surroundings and the unbeatable , incomparable silence			0
it is easy to see why rumour has positioned the camp as a magnet for world - famous celebrities			0
one local whisper has even mentioned @entity164 – no doubt in search of the same things as us mere mortals			0
if you are looking for unpretentious , soul - soothing isolation , it does not get much better			0
one undeniably unusual sleep later ( a small note of warning – the fire in your lavvu has to be tended , by hand , with pre-cut logs every two hours – otherwise , well , you will freeze ) , i wake to the sound of mushing , and the arrival of ' @entity183 '			0
sixteen perfectly trained pure - bred @entity185 huskies are at the camp 's disposable – all of them friendly , approachable and happy - to - meet - you hounds			0
this will explain why , an hour later , i find myself spread - eagled on the icy surface of another frozen lake , having been comically clattered to the floor while attempting to fend off their affections			0
let 's see what 's below the surface : an afternoon of endeavour carving out ice blocks with traditional tools looking up , seeing the lights : a stay at @entity41 also means chances to see the @entity131 after dusting myself off and returning to camp , i am encouraged to spend the day 's last few hours of sunlight carving ice blocks out of the lake using the time - honoured tools of saws and manual corkscrews			1
as the sun sets in the only way @entity214 knows how – retina - dazzling shades of oranges and pinks , kaleidoscopically reflected by the ice and snow – and a few more logs are flung on the fire , i decide that , maybe , i am a camper after all			2
@entity223 ( 01274 875 199 ; www.taberhols.co.uk ) offers an ‘ @entity224 ’ in @entity18 , from £ 1,975 per person			2
the price includes flights from @entity228 to @entity57 via @entity229 , transfers , the @entity231 , one night at the @entity41 in a lavvu and three nights at the nearby @entity234 – and is based on two sharing			1
the final night at @entity236 can also be swapped for a night in the @entity237 in nearby @entity238			0
trips depart daily from 5 january until 31 march 2015			0
