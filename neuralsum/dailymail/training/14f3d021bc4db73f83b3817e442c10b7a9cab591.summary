by @entity0 sometimes you just have to go			0
and for a passenger on a recent @entity4 flight in @entity5 , that meant urinating in a takeaway coffee cup			1
@entity8 was on a flight from @entity10 to @entity11 when she discovered that the plane did n't have a toilet			1
she then found that the bathrooms at the two airstrips her flight stopped at were n't working			2
last resort : @entity8 was forced to urinate in a takeaway coffee cup keen to relieve herself , she went outside to urinate before leaving @entity20 because the bathroom was out of order and when she asked to use the restroom during a stop in @entity25 , she also found that it was out of order			1
' i said [ to the pilot ] , ' @entity28 , boy , i 'm going to have to use that empty @entity31 cup back there because i really got ta use the washroom , ' and he had a little smile on his face and he said , " well , there 's a little bag out there too if you need to use it , " so i used both , ' @entity8 said			2
' it was a choice between peeing in my pants , or peeing in a @entity31 cup , ' she said			0
out of order : passengers have been taking desperate measures when airport and aeroplane toilets are out of action this comes a week after a passenger urinated in a plastic bag on an @entity55 flight to @entity56			1
@entity59 mha @entity57 told @entity60 : ' in this day and age , it 's not necessary and i do n't think it 's that hard with the technology these days to go and assess the situation and install a system			0
' ' i think it takes a story like the one about the passenger on the plane ... a lot of people just take it for granted the toilets are going to freeze up , it 's a common thing , but people are just starting to realize that , " hey , this is not good enough , " ' he said			0
' we should be able to have the same as everyone else in the province in their airports			0
