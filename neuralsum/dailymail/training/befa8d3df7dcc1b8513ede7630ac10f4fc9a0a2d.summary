@entity1 star @entity0 today called for a new campaign against cruel @entity4 bear bile farms after the death of a charismatic and inspiration moon bear who became a symbol of the fight			1
@entity10 survived 30 years of captivity on a bile farm but died yesterday after beating overwhelming odds to live out the final years of his life in freedom - and was hailed yesteday as ' the bravest bear '			1
he won a host of celebrity admirers including @entity20 star @entity19 after being rescued with a group of other bears from appallingly cramped cages in a bear farm in @entity25			2
@entity0 , who plays chef @entity26 in the drama , told @entity28 : ' i feel devastated that amazing @entity10 is no longer with us			2
his horrendous incarceration in a crush cage for 30 years is quite difficult to comprehend			2
' how could any living creature cope under those conditions for that long ? so it makes him all the more special			0
' @entity10 confounded expectations when he survived emergency roadside surgery during his dramatic rescue in 2010 to live his remaining four years in a bear sanctuary in @entity41 , western @entity4 , run by the @entity43 charity @entity42			1
and bless the wonderful @entity42 for fighting to save his life - and then caring for him so magnificently			0
in his memory we have to strengthen the fight to end this disgusting , inhumane practice and support the @entity4 people in doing so			0
' a charming bruiser who seemed to shrug off the shocking infirmities wrought by years of abuse , @entity10 came to epitomise the growing animal rights movement in @entity50 and starred in a film called @entity82 that helped turn public opinion against bear bile farming			1
moon bears rarely live beyond 30 , however , and @entity1 star @entity0 was moved to tears by the sight of him shuffling around his enclosure when she visited the @entity50 sanctuary in @entity41 in @entity41 sanctuary in june			1
but on wednesday , as his condition worsened , vets took the decision to euthanise him and a stream of employees who helped rescue him and then cared for him at the sanctuary in his peaceful last years held his paw to say a tearful final goodbye			0
@entity42 founder and ceo @entity99 said she was heartbroken at @entity10 's death but said he had won the most important battle of his life when he survived his rescue from the @entity25 bear farm in 2010			1
' @entity10 was a broken bear when we found him , ' she recalled			2
' his body and legs were misshapen by years of being crushed in a cage and we feared he would not survive the 1,500 mile journey home			0
' on that day , when @entity10 's condition began to deteriorate – panting heavily and refusing to eat – our vets decided that only an emergency operation would save his life			1
fight for life : @entity10 had to undergo four hours of surgery by the roadside when he was rescued			1
@entity10 's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen suffering : more than 10,000 endangered @entity122 black bears – known as moon bears - are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across @entity4 and southeast @entity128 countries			1
@entity10 pictured above in his cage harvested : catheters are jabbed into the bears ' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders			0
bear bile sells for around £ 10 - a - millilitre and is used in traditional @entity4 medicines to treat a range of illnesses ' he was an old bear who had suffered more than anyone can imagine but it just did n't seem right that he could be so close to freedom and not make it			1
' with a local police escort , the trucks carrying @entity10 and the other bears rescued from the farm went to a local hospital and borrowed a bottle of oxygen needed for anaesthetic			1
after four hours of roadside surgery watched by a huge crowd of onlookers , @entity10 's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a crude and painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen to fasten the gall bladder to his abdominal wall			1
@entity162 said : ' @entity10 brought so many people together that day – from @entity25 to @entity41 and across the country – and he 's continued to do so ever since			0
as an old bear who refused to give up , his fight inspired ours			0
' his story has continued to be told across the world and has raised increasing awareness of the horrors of bear bile farming			2
our broken bear turned teacher and his stoic , gentle nature will continue to inspire the rescue of so many more			0
' more than 10,000 endangered @entity122 black bears – known as moon bears for the cream - coloured crescents on their chests – are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across @entity4 and southeast @entity128 countries			0
