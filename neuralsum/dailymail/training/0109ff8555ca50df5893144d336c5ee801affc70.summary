think @entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2			0
think @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 and the @entity6 , known as hotbeds of homosexuality			0
but they are nothing like the uninhibited urban gay sexual scene and vast homosexual subculture that flourished in @entity13 under @entity15 's @entity14			1
sexual experimentation between the same sexes and medical advances of helping genders ‘ trapped within the wrong body ’ in @entity15 more than one hundred years ago shaped our understanding of gay identity today			1

the @entity14 emerged out of the wreckage of @entity15 's war			2
the @entity87 was gone , the 1919 @entity86 saw the abolition of the @entity89 and the loss of significant amounts of its territory			0
it was a troubled and tortured time for @entity15 , but @entity31 , the old imperial capital became its most liberal city			1
high living , a vibrant urban life and relaxed social attitudes , along with the influx of @entity102 money defined the @entity103 in @entity31 that was the most creative period in @entity15 history			1
writers , poets , artists from @entity109 , @entity110 , the @entity102 arrived in the @entity15 city to witness and experience the wild erotic sexual freedom along with curiosity seekers , voyeurs , and homosexuals			1
@entity117 @entity116 , @entity118 and @entity119 all came to indulge their sexual appetites in the hedonistic nightlife and party culture of the @entity15 capital – or they came to witness the ‘ luridly licentious @entity31 ’ , spiking their own voyeuristic impulses			1
‘ the pervasive prostitution ( both male and female ) , the public cross-dressing , and the easy access to bars and clubs that catered to homosexual men and lesbians were just a few of the features that supported @entity31 ’s sex industry ’			1
transvestite prostitutes sitting on the laps of gay men in the popular @entity31 gay bar @entity141 @entity142 , was the winner of the @entity145 transvestite pageant in 1926 there were twenty - five to thirty separate homosexual @entity15 - language periodicals that were appearing in @entity31 , weekly or monthly			1

openly nudist and homosexual titles were displayed in the kiosks			0
same - sex bars , clubs and cafes advertised as well as the professional services of doctors , dentists , lawyers , stationers … all with the implied ‘ friends patronize friends ’			1
in those magazines , anyone facing blackmail found private detectives to track down extortion threats			0
cross-dressers found dressmakers who tailored for large sizes			1
there were the single ads placed by individuals forever in search of love			2
the @entity102 modernist artist , poet and essayist @entity183 , a habitué of 1920s @entity31 , ‘ attended large transvestite balls and patronized homosexual bars frequented by male hustlers			1
he later recalled , ‘ life in @entity31 then was at the height of heights – that is to the highest pitch of sophistication and abandon			1
none of us had seen anything quite like the spectacle ’			0
acclaimed @entity102 architect @entity194 often considered the dean of @entity102 architects , ‘ availed himself of @entity31 ’s male prostitution ’			1
‘ @entity199 was never that hospitable ’ , @entity194 said			2
he became fluent in @entity15 later saying , ‘ i learned it the best way , using " the horizontal method "			1
' transvestites having drinks in the @entity205 club that was not hidden away but celebrated in the golden age of the gay bar and club scene in @entity31			1
it was a hot spot for high society and partying until dawn was the norm dr @entity214 opened the @entity32 in march 1919 , the first such facility in the world to offer medical and psychological counseling on sexual issues to heterosexual men and women , homosexuals , cross-dressers and intersex individuals also known as hermaphrodites or individuals caught between male and female			1
‘ the institute represented the first attempt to establish " sexology " , or sexual science , as a topic of legitimate academic study and research			1
‘ nowhere else in the world was there so much as a university department or chair devoted to the subject , much less an entire institute , ' writes author @entity80			0
@entity239 also emphasized public education and had a museum of sexuality , the @entity243 , with not only wall charts and photographs but also cases filled with phalluses and fetishes from around the globe			0
photographs of homosexuals dressed in huge hats , earrings and makeup adored the walls as well as women in men ’s clothing and top hats			0
when dr @entity261 , a @entity262 physician and prominent activist for birth control , visited the institute in 1925 , he stated : ‘ it is an institution absolutely unique in the whole world … which i hoped to establish in the @entity102 but which i felt would not thrive on account of our prudish , hypocritical attitude to all questions of sex			2
’ it was at this institute that @entity214 and his colleagues pioneered some of the first sex - reassignment surgeries as well as primitive hormone treatments dr @entity214 studied cross-dressing , men and women who wore the clothing of the opposite sex			1
previously interpreted as a symptom of homosexuality by psychiatrists and sexologists , and associated with prostitution and criminal activity , @entity214 believed cross-dressers were often heterosexual			0
picture postcard of the gay club @entity291 , popular in the late 1920s and early 1930s			0
always under a blue haze of cigarette and cigar smoke , film stars , cabaret artists and wealthy nobility were regulars including a young @entity299 alongside princes , counts and barons			0
@entity305 officials sort through ' un-german ' and ' perverted ' materials in the debris of the @entity307 , that was ransacked on may 6 , 1933 , for a book burning event they staged four days later			0
male and female impersonators drew huge crowds at cabarets , circuses and variety theatres – as well as providing entertainment at the big transvestite balls and homosexual clubs , but they faced the possibility of being arrested by the police and harassed			2
dr @entity214 helped reform the practices of the @entity31 police and convinced them to issue ‘ transvestite passes ’ so that performers could work without fear of harassment although there was no law prohibiting public cross-dressing			1
but dressing like the opposite sex sometimes inspired the desire for a physical metamorphosis			0
so the doctor performed one of the first ( primitive ) male - to - female sex - reassignment surgeries on a twenty - three year old officer who had fought in @entity340 from childhood on , he felt he was trapped in the wrong body and only went into the military to demonstrate his masculinity			1
but that did n’t subdue his feminine feelings and when the war was over , he felt suicidal			0
@entity214 ’s colleague , dr. @entity348 removed the man ’s testicles and the effect was quite successful leading to a ‘ psychic relaxation and a permanent feeling of harmony and balance ’			2
his facial hair disappeared and now he passed for a woman			0
he visited a @entity360 gynecologist , dr. @entity359 , who made a ‘ vagina - like structure ’ and tucked his member up in there in what was the first attempt to construct a vagina for a man			2
five months later , the former officer was back and reported having erections			0
he also had fallen in love with a woman , abandoned his cross-dressing and was now masculine			0
the doctor successfully undid the surgery and restored his masculinity			0
afternoon teas and large costume balls were held at the institute as another venue for flamboyant cross-dressers			2
the balls attracted young male prostitutes along with the cross-dressers and prominent , open homosexuals			2
@entity214 wanted homosexual men and lesbians to experience greater erotic fulfillment that was n’t connected to procreation			0
with the @entity391 , and the crash of the @entity102 stock market , the @entity390 was slipping away to a @entity26 - led government by spring 1930 , the @entity389 were on the rise with the new @entity397 election			0
in 1933 @entity26 completed his march to power - and with fury the @entity389 pursued @entity214 as a symbol of all they hated – as @entity402 , homosexual and sexologist			2
the party in @entity31 was over .			2

an uninhibited urban gay sexual scene flourished in @entity31 , @entity15 in the wake of @entity340
the science of ‘ transsexuality ’ was founded at the @entity32 where the first male - to - female surgery was performed
@entity15 scientists concluded that same - sex love was a natural , inborn characteristic and not merely the perversion of a ‘ normal ’ sexual tendency
