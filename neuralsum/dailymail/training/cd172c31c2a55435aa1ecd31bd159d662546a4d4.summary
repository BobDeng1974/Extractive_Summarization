by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 04:45 est , 16 december 2013 the chief inspector of schools faced a barrage of criticism from conservative mps last night after he said grammar schools are ‘ stuffed full of middle - class kids ’			1
sir @entity8 said the dominance of affluent children meant selective state schools had almost no role in improving the education of the poor			1
‘ a tiny percentage are on free school meals – three per cent			0
that is a nonsense , ’ he said			0
‘ anyone who thinks grammar schools are going to increase social mobility needs to look at those figures			1
i do n’t think they work			0
’ sir @entity8 ( seen here in an @entity24 school ) says grammar schools do not improve the chances of poorer pupils his comments angered @entity30 mps who believe expanding the grammar system could help reverse the decline in social mobility			1
@entity34 , chairman of the powerful @entity35 of backbench @entity29 , described sir @entity8 ’s intervention as ‘ unwise ’			1
the former education spokesman , whose @entity41 and @entity42 constituency is a bastion of the grammar school system , said : ‘ we have some very bad schools in this country and i think the chief inspector would be better advised to focus his attention on improving those , not criticising some of the good ones			1
’ mr @entity34 said grammar schools sometimes ended up selecting fewer children from poor homes because they had been failed by the state primary system			1
he said he was ‘ angry ’ that @entity55 chief inspector sir @entity8 appeared to have ignored evidence that high schools that operate alongside grammars in areas such as @entity60 in @entity61 show ‘ incredibly good performance ’			1
statistics show areas with selective state schools dominated @entity66 and a-level results last year			2
@entity68 came top , with 45.9 per cent of pupils gaining grades @entity70 or equivalent in 2012 , followed by @entity60 with 34.5 per cent			0
the state sector average is 16.8 per cent			0
sir @entity8 's comments angered @entity30 mps who believe grammar system could help reverse decline in social mobility high - performing local education authorities ( @entity77 ) with selective schools also included @entity79 in @entity80 and @entity81 in @entity82 , which have some of the worst areas of deprivation in the @entity85			1
seven of the top ten best performing @entity86 at @entity66 also offered grammar school places			0
@entity30 grandee @entity88 , who also went to grammar school , said the system should be ‘ maintained at all costs ’ because it remained ‘ the way working - class children get their chance in life , on an equal footing to children who can go to the private sector ’			2
he admitted that poorer youngsters had been ‘ elbowed out by ambitious middle class parents ’ in some areas			0
but he said the decline of grammars had left @entity85 ‘ more dominated than it ought to be by the products of private schools ’			2
he suggested this could be reversed if the grammar school system was allowed to expand			2
however , in an interview with the @entity109 , sir @entity8 suggested grammar schools only helped an elite 10 per cent of pupils – often with pushy parents			1
it is the second blow in a week for the grammar system , following a decision by education secretary @entity116 on friday to block an application to create a new ‘ supergrammar ’ in @entity119 , @entity120			2
the scheme was the first test of new rules that allow grammars to expand on satellite sites			0
but education sources said the bid was ‘ botched ’ and would have effectively created a new selective school , which is banned under existing law			0
yesterday the @entity130 refused to be drawn on the comments by sir @entity8 , who also claimed in a wide - ranging interview that summer holidays were too long and admitted that when he used the cane during his time as a teacher in the 1970s it had ‘ never worked ’			2
but he highlighted the role that ‘ pushy parents ’ could play in driving up standards			0
‘ pushy parents have usually got kids in schools where , because they are pushing hard , standards rise , ’ he said .			0
