blundering @entity1 transport chiefs have wasted millions on underground escalators that are 10cm too wide			1
the news of the ineffective escatlors comes just months after buying trains that are too wide for the platforms now 30 of the escalator stairs on the @entity8 will have to be replaced at a cost of six million euros			1
they were installed in 2005/2006 but have been subject to frequent breakdowns ever since			1
blundering @entity1 transport chiefs have waste millions on a new underground escalators that are 10cm too wide just months after buying trains that are too wide for the platforms ' the steps of the recent models are one metre wide instead of 90cm , ' explained @entity19 , who is in charge of electromechanical engineering for @entity22 , reported @entity23			1
the escalator was designed to be 10cm wider to accommodate more users , but this has prevented them from working properly and they consistently break down to the chagrin of commuters			1
the constant repairs cost @entity22 tens of thousands of euros each year so the operator has decided to cut its losses and will begin replacing the faulty escalators over the next year			1
according to @entity23 the @entity35 transport company has opened up legal proceedings against suppliers @entity38 ( @entity38 ) with the aim of forcing the company to stump up part of the costs			0
@entity1 is already facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm ( 0.11 inches ) too wide for many of its platforms but today @entity22 chiefs denied mr @entity19 's claim and insisted claims the regular breakdowns are due to the fact parts of the machinery are too fragile			2
@entity1 is already facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm ( 0.11 inches ) too wide for many of its platforms			2
the incredible mistake means that 1300 stations will have to be upgraded so as to accommodate the trains			0
rail operations ordered the new trains for the country 's regional network – one which traditionally has a reputation for being one of the best in the world			0
but they are too wide to travel through the nation 's stations , a report in the investigative weekly , @entity72 , reveals			2
repair work has so far been carried out on 300 of the platforms that need adjusting , and hundreds more are on a waiting list			0
on average , the trains are 3cms too wide			0
@entity77 , the organisation responsible for rail tracks in @entity1 , has set aside the equivalent of more than £ 45m to deal with the mistake , but the figure is likely to be well above £ 100m once it is finished .			0

engineer said it was because they are 10cm too wide
