a woman thought the handwritten letter she threw over the fence to her noisy neighbours had worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken before dawn on sunday			1
sleep - deprived @entity8 based - actor , @entity7 , wrote a two - page rant to her party - hard residents after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways			1
also a comedian , the good - humoured note had paid off until the recent early morning hiccup but she decided the neighbourly thing to do was drop a thank - you card and some gifts over the fence to the ' huge ' seven or eight guys because she was too scared to knock on their door			1
the note , which was posted on her blog and on the @entity49 site , began with thanking the less - noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on sunday she was grateful there was n't the ' bass guitar song ' interrupting her dreams about @entity56			1
' you probably think i 'm a bit weird and have too much spare time , and you are entirely correct			0
' the gifts included : a burnt dvd of the pilot episode of @entity64 where @entity65 breaks up a party on his namesake street by ' yelling at the flamin ' lot of them '			2
she then later reveals that the dvd is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on @entity75			2
two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her ' own old - school walkie - talkie ' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more effective communciation device			2
and in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party			2
last but certainly not least - @entity94 threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours			1
she signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence			1
one of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her ' own old - school walkie - talkie ' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party after she was woken by their voices on sunday morning , she wrote pros and cons about the incident - @entity118 is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling ' derpa " @entity7 even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics			1
she posted the letter on her blog with the precursor : ' so if you never hear from me again , i 've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours ' sound system			1
' @entity94 chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of ' funk ' in her letter that was also published on @entity49 website			2
' @entity144 , ' there are some choice swear words i would like to throw at you , but in the interest of being neighbourly , i 'm going to replace them all with the word ' funk '			0
' please turn your funking music down so i can get some funking sleep , ' the letter opened with			2
@entity7 wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways the actor / comedian used her humour in the two - page rant to get her rage across to the party - hard residents who live next door and cause her never - ending grief @entity7 even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics she then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them ' all the funking time '			1
adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for ' breakfast radio hosts , international flight passengers , and parents of infants			1
' @entity7 said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but would n't have been heard over the revving of their friend 's engine of their ' sh * thouse fancy ute			1
' ' they were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty , that i am worried that the man behind the wheel was : a ) drink driving b ) not sure how to drive @entity203 ) brain damaged @entity204 ) actually a potato			0
' she signed off with her @entity207 handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just ' head towards the loud house and turn left ' her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar ' over and funking over			0
' ' i 'm not sure if it 's you , or perhaps a friend , but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling ' derpa , derpa , derpa , derpa ' at the top of his lungs			0
is he okay ? ' she asked sarcastically			0
she expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human , brain damaged or simply a moron			0
the music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before @entity94 had to go out and begin her day			1
' everyone in my street probably feels the same			0
and the street behind us			0
and the deaf man in the next suburb			0
and anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away			0
' she also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the @entity247 was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs @entity7 said she bought this card because ' @entity251 ' was not available in a large size as the considerate neighbour , @entity7 gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with the apt songs : respect by @entity257 , ' @entity258 ' by @entity259 , ' all about the @entity260 ' by @entity261 , ' @entity262 ' by @entity263 and @entity264 ' by @entity265 ' because it 's just a funkin ' good song , really '			1
but she later revealed in the note that the @entity247 was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs			1
after suggesting to catch up over a @entity268 sometime , she asked them to ' grow up			0
' @entity7 also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time			2
