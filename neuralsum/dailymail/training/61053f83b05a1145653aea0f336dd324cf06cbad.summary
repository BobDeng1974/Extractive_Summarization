on january 12 last year beachcroft greeted by his supportive family and friends as he paddled into @entity9 after 17 long months circumnavigating the @entity6 @entity23 , ( being congratulated by a friend ) , documented his journey on a blog and his @entity28 page so his supporters could follow his adventure @entity4 said the stretch was often referred to as ‘ the @entity32 of the @entity34 sea kayaking ’			1
but tackling the waters was well worth it as the scenery he paddled through in western @entity8 was the biggest highlight of the entire trip for the 45 - year - old			1
@entity4 described the remote and wild parts of southern and western of @entity8 as ‘ stunningly beautiful ’			1
the @entity43 in north @entity6 came in as a close second for the same reasons			0
the seed was planted for @entity23 a few years ago when he read @entity50 sea kayaker @entity49 ’s book on his adventures when he circumnavigated the country – minus @entity8			2
one of the most confronting and surreal moments of his long voyage was fighting off a crocodile in northern @entity6			2
@entity4 was camped up a hill when he heard his kayak being moved in the middle of the night and went down to discover a crocodile was pulling his boat into the water			2
in a lucky escape , @entity4 managed to hit the predator on the head with a hand spear that was attached to his kayak			1
‘ i was n’t feeling fear – it was only two metres - i ’m not concerned until they are at least four metres , ’ he said			0
‘ i was just thinking “ i need my boat and the food on it ”			0
’ it was n’t the only time the kayaker had an encounter with a member of the large reptile family – he also paddled right over the top of a crocodile while at @entity79 in @entity80			0
@entity4 ( middle ) catches up with friends @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 his second last sunrise in @entity88 in @entity86 it was n’t unusual for sharks to take a bite out of the kayak – something that @entity23 experienced at least 50 times			1
‘ they are attracted to the rudder but once they realised they ca n’t eat it they usually swim away , ’ @entity4 said			0
‘ but this one stupid bronze whale shark kept biting so i had to whack it on the nose			0
’ another challenging moment was when he broke a couple of ribs in @entity107 after he hit the side of his kayak during rough surf conditions which slowed him down for about five weeks			2
despite being a solo quest , @entity4 was n’t entirely alone with ' @entity112 ' given to him as a travelling companion for the trip			0
@entity4 is not a stranger to the outdoor life – he is going back to his job working as an outdoor guide in the @entity119			2
there was not a single point throughout the voyage that the intrepid adventurer had any regrets or even thought for a second about giving it all up			0
‘ i ’ve been told i ’m determined , ’ he admitted			0
but he did miss the usual pleasures such as his own bed and being able to kick back and watch a movie , and not so typically – rock climbing			0
despite roughing it for the best part of a year and a half , @entity4 is not heading straight to a health spa for a pamper treatment but hitting the ski fields in @entity137			2
‘ i find skiing relaxing , ’ he said			0
stormy ocean view from the rocks at @entity141 in @entity142 on june 8 @entity4 's kayak ( pictured at @entity144 , @entity145 ) did n't let him down over the 17 month voyage @entity4 ( pictured heading out of @entity147 ) had no regrets at any point throughout the 17 month journey taking a well - earned rest at @entity152 in @entity153 ' @entity112 ' was given to @entity23 by a friend as a travelling companion ' @entity112 ' having a snack in @entity157 , @entity107 the end is near for @entity23 as @entity160 , @entity158 is in his sights			1
