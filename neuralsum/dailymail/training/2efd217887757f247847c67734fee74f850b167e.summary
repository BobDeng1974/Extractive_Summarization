by @entity1 reporter published : 05:57 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 24 october 2013 an underground @entity3 motel inspired by @entity4 is just one of the unique places to stay at the world 's most unusual hotel complex			1
but if subterranean sleeping does n't sound appealing , guests can rest their head in a train , plane or boat at the themed @entity16 estate in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the 3.5 hectare estate is home to a variety of unusual lodging experiences for visitors , including a range of historic transport units which have been decked out and turned into self - catering accommodation			1
the self - contained rooms come with kitchens , shower and toilet facilities and can accommodate between two to 10 people			2
@entity16 also offers visitors the chance to stay in a 1950 's train and @entity64 plane , which was one of the last allied planes out of @entity67 , and a @entity69 patrol boat			2
park owner @entity70 said : ' my park contains four different and unusual places to stay , that you would never get to experience in normal everyday life			1
' i wanted to go into tourism , but it had to be something different			0
' i saw an advertisement online for an old decked out train , and straight away i just knew that was what i had been looking for			2
' upgrade : guests can also stay in a @entity64 plane , which was an aircraft used during the @entity67 conflict by @entity88 armed forces grounded : the plane has been converted into a two - room unit and is the only one of its kind room with a view : one of the bedrooms inside the plane allows guests to sleep in a cockpit the fully refurbished plane comprises two self - contained motel units and is the only accommodation of its type in the world , while the " the @entity107 " is a @entity104 restored into a completely self - contained motel unit with two separate bedrooms			0
it sleeps up to six people and comes with a double bed and two sets of single bunks			0
@entity70 explained : ' it was important for me that i carried on with the theme , and that it was n't just a one hit wonder			1
' my next idea was for the plane motel , which was difficult as i knew i had to get the right one			0
' as they 're not very big inside , it proved more difficult than i 'd hoped , until i eventually tracked this one down in @entity123 that i knew would be perfect			0
all aboard : the 112ft ' @entity124 ' is another of park owner @entity70 ' imaginatively themed rooms big ideas : the boat which is inspired by the @entity128 , mr @entity129 , pictured right , said it took two years to complete the 112ft boat , called @entity124 , took @entity70 two years to complete			1
' it boasts five rooms as is one of only 12 of its kind left			0
' people are always so excited when they visit the motels ' , @entity70 said			1
' people who have an interest in trains , boats and planes come here simply because of their love of the vehicles			0
' because the motels here have a historical aspect to them , it has become an almost tourist attraction			0
' sleeper train : ' the @entity107 ' is a @entity104 restored into a completely self - contained motel comfortable : the interior of the train boasts kitchen and dining areas , and sleeps two guests			2
