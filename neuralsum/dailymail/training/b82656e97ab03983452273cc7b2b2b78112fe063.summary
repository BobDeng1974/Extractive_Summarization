five top schools send as many pupils to @entity3 and @entity4 as 1,800 state schools put together , a new analysis has revealed			1
a small group of elite schools is tightening its grip on the country ’s most prestigious universities as wealthy families spend increasing sums on education			1
three well - known private schools and two elite sixth - form colleges supplied 260 @entity17 entrants in 2011/12 - the same number as 1,800 state schools across @entity20			1
@entity23 at @entity24 , where entrants came from five of the country 's top schools similar research relating to the previous three years found that the top five schools and colleges produced as many @entity17 acceptances as about 1,500 state schools			1
the charity behind the research warned of a growing divide between @entity35 ’s wealthiest families and ‘ normal ’ middle - income pupils			1
@entity39 families were devoting more of their resources than ever to education because they recognised its increasing importance in landing top jobs and ‘ positions of power ’ , it was claimed			0
the five top schools for producing @entity17 entrants include @entity48 , which was @entity50 ’s old school , @entity51 , where @entity52 was an old boy , and @entity53 ’s , which educated @entity54			1
the remaining two schools are large state sixth - form colleges – @entity57 in @entity4 and @entity58 in @entity59 - which have become the ‘ choice destinations for professional parents wanting to maximise the chances of their children getting into @entity17 ’			1
the analysis - produced by the @entity66 education charity - also shows that just 40 schools and colleges provided about a quarter of all @entity17 entrants in 2011/12			1
these schools are a mix of elite private schools and top - performing state grammars and sixth - form colleges			1
the only state comprehensive to make the list is @entity75 , which is based in @entity3			0
in a blog , @entity76 , the trust ’s director of development and policy , said the figures were ‘ powerful ’ because they show the ‘ extent to which a tiny minority of the country ’s 2,750 schools and colleges dominate enrolment at prestigious universities ’			0
this was a ‘ sombre message for the 100,000s of students waiting to receive their a-level results this august ’			0
he argued that despite ‘ valiant efforts ’ by universities , entry to elite campuses was increasingly dominated by children from the most privileged families			0
‘ the concern is that a small cadre of schools and colleges is tightening its grip on elite university places , ’ he said			1
‘ the figures indicate that students from the wealthiest families could be pulling further away in the race for prestigious academic degrees , and the positions of power they pave the way to			2
@entity48 ( pictured ) is one of the top school 's that sends its pupils to either @entity3 or @entity117 ‘ this yawning gap is not just a problem for our poorest children but also those from “ normal ” middle income homes			2
’ mr @entity76 added : ‘ the social mobility arms race is escalating with each academic year as the richest families increasingly devote more resources to ensure that their children excel at school and university			0
‘ they recognise education ’s increasing importance in who wins in the workplace			0
’ the research is based on the latest available data from the @entity137 , published earlier this year			0
billions of pounds have been spent over the last 15 years on outreach schemes , bursaries and funding aimed at up opening up access to university			0
but the analysis shows that the proportion of a-level students attending comprehensives and progressing to the country ’s 30 most academically demanding universities fell from 23 per cent in 2008/09 to 19 per cent in 2011/12			0
mr @entity76 warned that prominent positions in politics , law , the media and the civil service - where an @entity17 degree ‘ remains the passport to success ’ - would continue to be dominated by graduates from a narrow range of backgrounds			2
but he also said the figures also highlighted some ‘ exceptional ’ comprehensives whose pupils are getting the grades and the know - how to get into @entity17 and other top universities			2
the list includes @entity167 , which was built up from scratch by sir @entity169 , now head of @entity170 , and sent seven per cent of its pupils to @entity17 in 2011/12			0
‘ we know that there are tens of thousands more academically talented children in schools across the country who could be real candidates for university , and even perhaps an @entity17 degree , ’ mr @entity76 added .			2
