by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 10 november 2013 can you @entity1 it ? cockney rhyming slang is being driven out by a new language sweeping across the country			2
the hybrid dialect , which , like cockney , combines slang with a different pronunciation , has been dubbed @entity11 by linguistic researchers			1
it was originally nicknamed @entity11 - fake @entity14 - but scientists have now said it is a dialect that been influences by @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
popularised : actor @entity22 , left , and rapper @entity23 , right , helped spread @entity11 even further @entity24 , professor of socio - linguistics at @entity26 , said : ‘ there are two things going on : youth slang , which a lot of people use			1
‘ but there are [ also ] core users of @entity11 and to them it is a dialect and an accent			2
it does n’t have to have slang in it			0
‘ it ’s a new kind of @entity20 in a way			1
’ rap artists such as @entity23 and @entity44 - born actor @entity22 have helped to popularise the dialect in the @entity45			2
though much of the slang is @entity47 or @entity14 in origin - with words such as ‘ blud ’ meaning friend and ‘ ends ’ meaning neighbourhood - the pronunciation is often not			0
in @entity11 ‘ like ’ is pronounced ‘ lahke ’ , but this ‘ ah ’ sound in place of the ‘ i ’ is not @entity18			1
mr @entity24 told the @entity58 : ‘ it is an extension of just using the slang			0
@entity61 ( friend ) @entity62 ( relax ) @entity63 ( trainers ) @entity65 ( neighbourhood ) @entity67 ( very ) ‘ all of these features have arisen out of the huge mix of languages and accents heard in some parts of @entity73			1
this means they are home - grown			0
‘ it ’s the slang that gives it a @entity80 or @entity47 feel and its use in @entity45 hip - hop adds to this impression , too			0
’ like cockney , @entity11 users will omit or replace certain letters in words			2
the letters ‘ th ’ are usually replaced by an ‘ f ’ or ‘ v ’ , as in ‘ fink ’ or ‘ muvver ’			0
but unlike cockney , @entity11 users do not drop their aitches			0
the language is often picked up at a young age , and particularly in schools where 50 per cent of pupils have @entity21 as a second language			0
variants of @entity11 have also emerged in multicultural cities such as @entity100 and @entity101 , mr @entity24 said : ‘ a lot of the core speakers are in the @entity73 of @entity73 , where they have low opportunities , and so one of the mechanisms when people find themselves unable to make progress in life or [ are ] discriminated against is to speak differently , to use that as an exclusionary strategy			1
