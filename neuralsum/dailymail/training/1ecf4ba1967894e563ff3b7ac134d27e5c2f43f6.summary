@entity1 manager @entity0 admits his scouts drew a blank when asked to find a chink in @entity6 's armour			1
the @entity8 leaders may have surrendered their unbeaten record against @entity10 last week , but even that does not fill @entity0 with optimism			1
the @entity13 are fierce hosts at @entity14 and will be even more hungry than usual as they look to atone for dropping points last time out			1
the scale of the challenge is not lost on @entity0 , who revealed his analysts had not been overly helpful in plotting a way past @entity21 's men			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 admits he struggled to find a weakness in @entity6 's side ' it 's funny ... one of the reports i get from the scouts usually tries to highlight a weakness and this one came back as ' none : they do n't have any weakness ' , which i thought was quite amusing			1
' they have marvellous talent			0
they have n't just got flair players , they 're good at set - pieces , they 're big and strong , they 're powerful , good in attacking areas			0
' they 're one of the best teams in @entity40 and they 've arguably got the best coach too			0
@entity43 's box office , the fella			2
what @entity21 has done is quite remarkable			0
' i remember going there with @entity48 a few years ago ( 2010 ) and winning 3 - 0 , which always sticks with me , but that does n't happen very often			0
' @entity51 scored twice as @entity10 ended @entity6 's unbeaten start to the @entity8 @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55 look dejected defeat at @entity56 quashed growing expectation that @entity6 would match @entity59 's ' @entity58 ' this season , but @entity0 would not have been surprised to see them repeat that feat. ' they had the look of being unbeatable did n't they ? ' he added			1
' @entity21 's come back in and does what he does very well			2
' you have to go and work against @entity6 because they do			1
they 're a terrific team who everyone thought would be unbeatable			0
it just shows you what this league is that their eight - or nine - point lead has been taken down to three			0
' so if we go with the same mentality as we did to @entity76 and @entity59 , who knows , maybe we can take something from them			0
' @entity0 knows this is a big time of year for @entity1 after they slipped into the bottom three despite relishing the challenge of taking on the title favourites , @entity0 's priorities over the festive period are likely to lie elsewhere			1
@entity85 , @entity48 and @entity86 represent the next three games and it is results against those sides that provide the best route out of the bottom three			2
' now is a big month coming up , we have big games coming up and let 's hope we can go and win a couple of them and put us back in mid-table where we all want to be , ' he said			2
' we 're probably four or five points short of where we want to be and we 've got a cluster of games coming up over @entity104			0
if we can put back to back wins together you could find yourself up in the top half of the division			2
