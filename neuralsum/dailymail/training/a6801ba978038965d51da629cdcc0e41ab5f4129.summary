by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 16 december 2013 signal : deputy prime minister @entity2 left the door firmly open to further welfare reform yesterday @entity2 has signalled he is prepared to consider @entity5 calls to cut the £ 26,000 household benefit cap and limit child - related benefits for the jobless - but only if the axe is also taken to pensioners ’ perks			1
the deputy prime minister left the door firmly open to further welfare reform yesterday , saying it was inevitable that more would have to be done in the years ahead			1
chancellor @entity13 has indicated that ‘ billions ’ more in cuts to social security will be necessary after the next election , on top of the £ 18billion already introduced			0
tories have floated a possible reduction in the £ 26,000 household benefit cap , introduced by the government this year so that it is not possible to earn more in welfare than on average earnings , and limits on child benefit and other payments for unemployed parents who have more than two children in future			1
mr @entity2 said it would not be fair to remove child - related benefits from those already in receipt of them , but refused to oppose either idea in principle , agreeing that further reform of the welfare state will be necessary			1
‘ i ’m not going to start drawing great circles around this policy or that policy			0
i want to look at it in the round , ’ the deputy prime minister said			0
on a lower benefit cap , he added : ‘ it ’s not something that i ’m advocating at the moment because we ’ve only just set this new level and it ’s £ 26,000 , which is equivalent to earning £ 35,000 before tax … ‘ i think we need to keep that approach , look and see how it works , see what the effects are , but not rush to start changing the goalposts before the policy has properly settled down			0
’ changes : chancellor @entity13 has indicated that ' billions ' more in cuts to social security will be necessary after the next election , on top of the £ 18billion already introduced however , mr @entity2 insisted that pensioners ’ free tv licences , bus passes and winter fuel payments would also have to be reviewed after the next general election			1
@entity67 has already said it would stop paying better - off older people some allowances , which the @entity5 pledged to protect till 2015			0
shadow chancellor @entity70 has said that the party would also end winter fuel payments , normally worth £ 200 for the over- 60s and £ 300 for those over the age of 80 , to 600,000 better - off pensioners , while the @entity77 have long argued pensioner benefits should be reined in			2
future : work and pensions secretary @entity79 is among those who are understood to believe that continuing to pay benefits to wealthy pensioners can not be justified beyond the next election there is no question of winter fuel payments , free bus passes and tv licences being means tested until after 2015 , because @entity89 made a cast iron pledge at the last election that they would be left untouched			1
however , there are significant internal disagreements in the @entity95 over whether the prime minister should repeat his pledge to ring - fence the payments at the next election , binding his hands until 2020			0
work and pensions secretary @entity79 is among those who are understood to believe that continuing to pay benefits to wealthy pensioners can not be justified beyond the next election			2
research commissioned by @entity104 suggests that a majority of the public back the idea of slashing handouts for better off pensioners			2
but the polling also confirms that the prime minister risks a ‘ crisis of trust ’ if he breaks his pledge , at least before the next election			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i have pushed within coalition but i have given up now because conservatives do n’t want to know , really			1
‘ i do n’t think there is any realistic prospect of getting anything delivered on that in the next 18 months			0
i have pushed both @entity13 and @entity89 but it is something they do n’t want to do , for reasons they will have to explain to you			0
’ mr @entity2 said that pensions minister @entity125 and cabinet office minister @entity126 were working on ‘ very useful ’ ideas on reforming universal pensioner benefits , adding : ‘ as we put together the @entity77 manifesto , we will make some announcements on this			1
’ the @entity77 leader said that stripping wealthy pensioners of their benefits would not raise enormous amounts of money but would be ‘ symbolically important ’ .			2
