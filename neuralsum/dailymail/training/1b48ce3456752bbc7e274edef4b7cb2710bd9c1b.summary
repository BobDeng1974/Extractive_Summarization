mrs @entity4 , 55 , said : ' it 's so sad			2
there must be lots of parents still alive whose babies are in there			0
' there might be a mother hearing this and thinking , ' i had a baby in that year , i never knew that happened '			0
' i have asked questions like ' how are they presented ? are they side by side or what ? were they in little coffins , or were they just wrapped in muslin ? ' the cemetery staff said they are not quite sure but there are some on top of each other			0
i just said " @entity62			0
there is no respect for the dead			0
' mrs @entity4 , of @entity2 , grew up knowing she had a sister called @entity23 , who had died shortly after birth until last month , she had had no other information , until her father revealed that @entity23 had been buried in @entity1			1
staff at the cemetery looked at old records and pointed mrs @entity4 towards a corner of the 34 - acre site where her sister was supposedly buried			1
but she found the whole plot was overgrown with brambles and branches and she was not able to access @entity23 's grave			0

' mr @entity95 said the area mrs @entity4 was asking about has been maintained as a wildlife reserve , but said he would possibly allow her to cut the area back			1
he said : ' i do n't think this is any different to what other cemeteries do in terms of attitudes towards the burial of babies			0
' all cemeteries back in that day did the same sort of thing			0
it was just a question of attitudes towards things in that day			0
' we now have a dedicated area for the burial of babies where parents can buy freehold graves			2
