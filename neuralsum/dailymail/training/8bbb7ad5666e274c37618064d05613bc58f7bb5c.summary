@entity0 will stage the inaugural @entity1 on may 2 next year – three years after it last hosted the continent 's showpiece fixture in its previous guise			1
the formation of new competitions in the wake of a revolt by @entity10 and @entity11 clubs has led to plans for @entity13 to stage the match to be abandoned			0
amid a turbulent spell of political unrest last season , it was announced that the 2015 final would take place at the iconic @entity21 in @entity22 , if the @entity23 survived			1
instead , the competition - which had taken place for 19 seasons - was replaced by the new , streamlined @entity27 , with clubs assuming greater control over that and the secondary @entity31 tournament			2
since that historic development , a pool draw has taken place , but there has been a logistical delay in revealing fixture details			0
glory : the @entity1 has replaced the @entity23 , which @entity39 won in 2014 hosts : @entity0 will be the venue for the inaugural @entity1 final on may 2 , 2015 international : the @entity1 final will take place four months before @entity45 face @entity46 in their @entity48 opener looking on : @entity45 head coach @entity49 will hope to see some of his players in the @entity1 final an announcement is due to be made on tuesday that @entity52 will host the finals on may 1 and 2 , with @entity0 securing the @entity27 decider just four months before the @entity48 begins at hq with @entity45 v @entity46			1
the major final was held there as recently as may , 2012 , when @entity59 crushed @entity60 42 - 14 in a one - sided , all - @entity62 encounter			0
the decision to stage the game at one of the world ’s leading venues makes sense in terms of capacity - 82,000 - and potential revenue			0
it is sure to be a lucrative sell - out , but doubtless organisers will be encouraged to consider the merits of taking a final to @entity13 in the near - future , to drive further development of the sport in that country			0
during the 19 seasons of the @entity23 , @entity80 staged seven finals , with four taking place in @entity52 and three in @entity84			2
the remaining finals were held in @entity86 ( two ) , @entity87 ( two ) and @entity88			0
@entity90 fixtures will be announced on thursday			1
@entity91 : @entity92 lifted the @entity23 for the second year in succession with @entity39 in 2014 showpiece : saracens were beaten by @entity39 in the @entity96 final - the last of the previous format return : the @entity1 final will see @entity0 host its first continental final in three years , and fifth overall			1

@entity0 will host the continent 's new showpiece final on may 2 , 2015
@entity23 has been *reformed* into the @entity1
formation of new competition means @entity21 will no *longer* be hosts
it will be the first time in three seasons @entity45 has hosted @entity90 final
@entity1 final is just four months before @entity45 's @entity48 opener with @entity46
