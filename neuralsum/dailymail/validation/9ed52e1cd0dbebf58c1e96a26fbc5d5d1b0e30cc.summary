' this recent accident demonstrates that the mental health checks lack the rigour that is specifically required in a safety sensitive industry like civil aviation , ' he said			0
and today it was discovered the co-pilot hid an illness from his employers			1
following a search of his @entity44 apartment , investigators revealed they had found torn - up sick leave notes - current ones and one issued for the day of the disaster			2
@entity12 locked the pilot out of the @entity62 's cockpit before setting the plane 's controls to descend into a rocky valley , @entity59 prosecutors said yesterday			1
he had previously been signed off from training with depression in 2008 and was reportedly receiving mental health support up until tuesday 's crash			2
the 28 - year - old was also in the middle of the ' relationship crisis ' with his girlfriend in the weeks before the crash and may have been struggling to cope with a break - up , @entity33 newspaper @entity69 reported			0
it was claimed this morning that the couple may have previously been engaged to be married next year			0
mr @entity8 , who was previously a researcher at the @entity77 at @entity78 , added : ' the safety net has a very wide mesh and that mesh needs to be narrowed			0
' athough suicide among pilots is not uncommon , murder - suicide is extremely rare			2
' slipped through the net : @entity7 co-pilot @entity12 had suffered from depression and ‘ burnout ’ which had held up his career investigators enter @entity12 's house on the outskirts of @entity44 yesterday as the probe into the crash continues in a blunt admission , @entity96 , the head of @entity97 , which owns the budget airline , admitted @entity12 had slipped through the safety net			1

‘ he was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions			0
' we have at @entity97 , a reporting system where crew can report – without being punished – their own problems , or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment			1
' all the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case			0
’ @entity12 passed one of the most rigorous assessments when he was accepted for flight training by @entity97 , according to @entity121			1
the airline said @entity12 trained at the @entity123 in @entity124			1
an assessment required by @entity33 's civil aviation authority , the @entity127 , plus standards imposed by @entity97 were needed before he was accepted			1
however , although the process includes psychometric testing of the candidate 's ability to work under pressure and handle stress , they do not examine personality or lifestyle more closely , @entity121 reported			1

investigation : @entity59 prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for what appears to be a case of suicide involving mass murder search : teams working in the difficult @entity30 terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings debris from the jet , operated by @entity97 's @entity7 budget airline , was found near @entity157 new information about @entity12 's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four - hour search of his flat , which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend			1

@entity33 ’s @entity180 confirmed this morning that @entity12 had a medical condition noted in his pilot ’s records which required him to have a regular examination			1

this is done before they first fly and at regular intervals after that – once a year for under - 40s and every six months for those over that age			0
pilots are not made to sit detailed psychological tests , but the doctors are qualified to spot problems including signs of stress , fatigue and drug or alcohol abuse			2
@entity189 standards state : ‘ during assessment of the applicant ’s history , the doctor should make a general inquiry about mental health , which may include mood , sleep and alcohol use			0
‘ the doctor should observe the applicant during the process of the examination and assess the mental state of the applicant			0
