mistake : former home secretary says the 2004 decision was ' well - intentioned ' but ' messed up ' @entity2 has admitted that throwing open @entity4 ’s borders to @entity6 migrants was a ‘ spectacular mistake ’			1
the former home secretary said @entity10 ’s 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to @entity12 and migrants from other new @entity15 states was a ‘ well - intentioned policy we messed up ’			1
his comments emerged on the same day as his successor as home secretary , @entity20 , warned that the influx of @entity23 migrants into @entity4 risked causing riots			1
mr @entity20 ’s comments reinforced the significance of mr @entity2 ’s admission about @entity10 ’s failure to anticipate the scale of migration when eight former @entity32 bloc nations became @entity15 members , and @entity4 – almost alone in @entity34 – allowed the free movement of workers between countries			1
at the time , the government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to @entity4 each year			1
the actual total over nearly a decade was more than a million			0
virtually every other @entity15 state , apart from @entity41 and @entity42 , kept their jobs markets closed for the seven years permitted			2
in an article for his local paper , the @entity47 , mr @entity2 – who is mp for @entity49 – admitted the forecasts were ‘ worthless ’			1
and he accepted the ‘ social dislocation ’ which can be caused when ‘ large numbers of people from abroad settle in a particular area ’			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ one spectacular mistake in which i participated ( not alone ) was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the @entity6 states like @entity12 and @entity58 which joined the @entity15 in mid- 2004			1
‘ other existing @entity15 members , notably @entity60 and @entity61 , decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011			1
' but we thought that it would be good for @entity4 if these folk could come and work here from 2004			0
not alone : mr @entity2 's successor @entity20 ( left ) has also spoken out about problems caused by immigration , warning that @entity23 migrants could cause riots			1
@entity75 leader @entity74 ( right ) applauded him it is estimated that more than 700,000 people from @entity78 could try to find work and settle in @entity4 ‘ thorough research by the @entity81 suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be “ relatively small , at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to 2010 ”			2
events proved these forecasts worthless			0
‘ net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010			0
lots of red faces , mine included			0
’ also critical : last year @entity93 said @entity10 's policy left communities ' struggling to cope ' his comments are the furthest any senior @entity10 figure has gone in accepting the party made serious errors in immigration policy during its time in power			1
mr @entity20 told the @entity102 that @entity23 groups from @entity104 who had settled in a district of @entity107 were behaving like they were living in a ‘ downtrodden village or woodland ’ where there were no toilets or litter collections			1
they were dumping rubbish on the streets , loitering late at night and causing ‘ friction ’ with residents , he added			0
the tensions have prompted existing residents of the @entity121 area to set up street patrols to try to combat the anti-social behaviour			0
since 2004 , several hundred @entity23 families have settled in the area , many with eight children or more			2
mr @entity20 said : ‘ we have got to change the behaviour and the culture of the incoming @entity23 community – because there ’s going to be an explosion otherwise			1
' we have got to be tough and robust in saying to people , “ you are not living in a downtrodden village or woodland ” – because many of them do n’t live in areas where there are toilets or refuse collection facilities			0
’ mr @entity20 said the ‘ understandable tensions ’ between different groups could lead to a repeat of the 2001 riots in @entity145 and @entity146			2
' if everything exploded , if things went wrong , the community would obviously be devastated			0
we saw this in @entity146 , @entity153 and @entity145 all those years ago when i first became home secretary			1
’ back track : mr @entity2 wrote in his local newspaper that the decision was made based on data showing 5,000 to 13,000 migrants a year would come to @entity4			1
' events proved these forecasts worthless '			0
tough : support for the @entity10 hit a three - year low in 2004 following the immigration announcement mr @entity20 ’s comments were welcomed by @entity75 leader @entity74 , who said they reinforced the need for a re-think over the dropping of similar border controls with @entity78 and @entity171 on january 1 next year			1
immigration campaigners have predicted the arrival of up to 50,000 people a year as a result of ending the transitional controls over nationals from the two countries			2
@entity78 has one of the largest @entity23 populations in @entity34 , with an estimated two million living there			2
last year @entity93 was criticised for dropping an admission that @entity10 ’s policy had left communities across @entity4 ‘ struggling to cope ’			2
in advance of a speech in december , his spin doctors suggested he would admit that the party ’s failures on immigration had damaged @entity4 and increased community tensions			0
' the @entity81 suggested the impact would be relatively small ... between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a years			2
events proved these forecasts worthless ' - @entity2 in his local newspaper he had been expected to say : ‘ we did too little to tackle the realities of segregation in communities that were struggling to cope			0
’ but the admission was dropped in favour of a vague acknowledgment that the party had made ‘ mistakes ’			0
mr @entity2 ’s comments will prompt further calls for @entity10 to apologise for its failure on immigration			0
mr @entity74 said : ‘ mr @entity20 should be admired for the courage he has shown by speaking so plainly			0
‘ the fact that he is talking of the significant difficulties with the @entity23 population already in his constituency should be taken seriously by the likes of @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity93			0
' my question is if they wo n’t listen to the dangers of opening the door to @entity78 and @entity171 next year when @entity75 speak out on it , will they listen to @entity20 ? ’ a recent @entity226 study suggested @entity4 ’s population of @entity23 – estimated at 200,000 – is one of the largest in @entity34 .			1

former home secretary said the party 's 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to migrants from other @entity15 states was a mistake
admission in his local paper is furthest any @entity10 minister has gone
his successor @entity20 also warned @entity23 migrants could cause riots
government had predicted influx of 13,000 a year - *1m* came in a decade
