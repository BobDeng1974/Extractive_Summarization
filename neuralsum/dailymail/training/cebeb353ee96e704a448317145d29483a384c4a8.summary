by @entity0 thousands of seriously ill cancer patients could be denied treatment under changes to the way drugs are funded on the @entity6			1
campaigners are warning that proposals from the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) will end the priority given to terminally ill patients			2
they estimate almost 13,000 cancer patients a year who are given life - prolonging drugs might be denied them under the new plans – with the elderly particularly vulnerable			1
they are urging the government to tell @entity9 to approve more treatments , as has been done in @entity21			0
campaigners say almost 13,000 cancer patients a year who are given life - prolonging drugs might be denied them under new plans to end the priority given to terminally ill patients - with the elderly particularly vulnerable @entity9 , which decides whether new medicines are cost - effective , is changing the criteria used to determine the value to patients and society of approving drugs			1
its appraisal committees will have to adopt a more ‘ favourable approach ’ when considering treatments for people whose conditions involve a ‘ high burden ’ of illness and where there is a wider impact on society			1
but the decision to remove ‘ end of life ’ criteria , which gave special consideration to the seriously ill , has raised widespread concern			1
campaigners fear the change could lead to a ‘ stealth cut ’ in the cost threshold for approval , and the downgrading of treatment for those nearing the end of their lives			1
five years ago @entity9 issued new guidance to allow some dying cancer patients to get costly life - extending drugs on the @entity6			1
the new end - of - life criteria meant drugs formerly regarded as too expensive were more likely to be approved if they could extend life – usually by at least three months			1
advisory bodies were told they had to ‘ fully consider ’ all the benefits to affected patients			0
the issue was raised following public criticism of @entity9 ’s refusal to fund certain drugs for patients with terminal cancer			1
it came to a head in 2008 , when the watchdog issued draft advice banning patients with advanced kidney cancer from receiving four life - prolonging drugs available in most other @entity86 countries			1
the drug @entity88 , along with 11 others , has now been approved under the current criteria			0
nearly 13,000 patients a year are benefiting from the guidelines			0
but campaigners claim the removal of end - of - life criteria means there is no certainty that life - extending drugs would continue to be funded			1
@entity99 , chief executive of the @entity100 , said the proposed reforms would be a ‘ backward step for cancer ’			2
he added : ‘ plans to abolish special rules for drugs used near the end of a patient ’s life have been slipped out in the small print of this consultation			1
‘ they amount to a stealth cut for cancer and could have a devastating impact on access to life - extending drugs , with no guarantee that other changes to the rationing formula will compensate			1
’ the reforms mark a shift to a system of value - based pricing that the @entity124 pledged would allow patients to ‘ access the drugs and treatments their doctors think they need ’			1
@entity9 proposes a new ‘ burden of illness ’ criteria , described as the loss in quality and length of life , to replace the current end - of - life protocol			1
it says other factors such as wider social impact , whether a new technology or drug is innovative , and non-health objectives such as reducing the impact on carers , will be taken into account			0
it will do this by measuring the burden of a disease in ‘ quality adjusted life years ’ , and comparing this with the years that people could expect to live without the condition			1
experts say this could discriminate against the elderly , as they have fewer years of life left			0
societal impact would look at a person ’s capacity to engage with society as a result of living with the disease			0
leading prostate cancer specialist professor @entity162 said : ‘ @entity9 is a monstrous and kafkaesque bureaucracy that is unanswerable to the public and their doctors			2
‘ it grows from strength to strength and costs millions and millions of pounds more to run , money that could be usefully spent on the treatment of patients			0
’ @entity173 , head of @entity174 , said ‘ @entity176 and @entity177 patients are being denied innovative new medicines that improve and extend lives			2
‘ we fear these proposals could be yet another sticking plaster solution that wo n’t solve that problem			0
‘ @entity124 must help @entity9 by setting a new mandate that frees it to champion innovation for the benefit of patients			2
‘ failing to act will create a two - tier health system , where patients in @entity176 are denied treatments available elsewhere in the @entity193			2
’ ahead of publication of the draft proposals , @entity9 said it would not discriminate against the elderly simply because they had had a ‘ fair innings ’			2
but a spokesman said it was ‘ difficult to say with certainty ’ whether the changes would lead to more treatments being approved			0
@entity202 with @entity203 during 2012 's @entity205 relay : the 66 - year - old was fought @entity9 because it refused to approve the new drug @entity88 when grandfather @entity202 was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2007 , he never dreamed he would spend the rest of his life fighting for the rights of patients			1
the former bank manager , 66 , was plunged into a battle with @entity9 because it refused to approve the new drug sutent			0
the drug rationing watchdog said it was too expensive , even though it had been shown to double survival time to 28 months			0
eventually the drug was approved under end - of - life criteria , meaning people with the most severe health needs get priority			2
but under the proposed changes , there is no certainty that @entity88 would be available on the @entity6			0
mr @entity202 , who lives near @entity226 , @entity227 , said : ‘ if i had n’t got @entity88 i would n’t be here today , almost seven years later			0
‘ those of us who campaigned , and are still campaigning , against the appalling process cancer patents have to go through to get vital drugs will carry on			2
‘ if restrictions get any worse more people with cancer will die earlier than they need to			0
’ mr @entity202 , who was awarded an mbe for his services to health , successfully lobbied prime minister @entity203 , his local mp , to create a £ 200million @entity238 for @entity176 in 2011			0
the father of two , who lives alone since his wife died of breast cancer in 2011 , said : ‘ more than 38,000 patients have benefited , we have made a difference			0
‘ but i look forward to the time when very ill patients do not have to spend their precious time trying to access effective drugs which are freely available in other countries			0

campaigners say almost 13,000 might be denied life - prolonging drugs
plans amount to a ' stealth cut ' in cancer care , it is claimed
