by @entity1 reporter published : 20:00 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 4 march 2013 high street shoppers : men are more likely to fall for red price labels while women see through the marketing ploy ask a man to go shopping with you and he really might see red – but not in the way you might expect			1
researchers have discovered that men are seduced by red price labels , while women see through the marketing ploy			1
faced with sales prices written in red , men in the @entity17 study believed they were saving nearly twice as much as when the cost was laid out in black and white			1
lead researcher dr @entity21 , of @entity22 , said : ‘ essentially , women are better shoppers than men and spend more time shopping			1
‘ they appear to be immune to the effects of prices in red because they tend to process advertisements in greater depth , and are more sceptical			2
‘ but when men see prices in red they feel more positive and think there are greater savings to be had			1
‘ men appear to be particularly susceptible to the effects of red colour , possibly for evolutionary reasons			2
’ the study , published in the @entity39 , involved three experiments with around 400 people who looked at price labels and advertisements , rating them for the amount of money they would save			0
in each case , the men thought they were saving more when the price was in red and believed those products offered savings 85 per cent greater than the black - priced items			0
for women there was no difference between the colours			0
when researchers told the men the decision was important and they looked more closely at the labels , the ‘ red effect ’ disappeared			2
the researchers also found that looking at red prices put men in a more positive mood			1
@entity22 researchers found that men believed they were saving more when the price was on a red label previous research has shown that men are more attracted to women who wear red , that waitresses in red get bigger tips and that women hitchhikers are more likely to be picked up when wearing red			1
it has been suggested that this is because in evolutionary terms a rosy complexion in a female can be a sign of increased fertility			0
dr @entity21 said : ‘ men seem to respond to red as a superficial cue			0
they literally see red and have a more positive attitude			0
‘ other research has shown that men are attracted by the colour red			0
in one experiment , women who wore red shirts were considered more attractive and were likely to be asked out			0

@entity22 researchers say red prices make men feel more positive
women spend more time shopping and are more sceptical
