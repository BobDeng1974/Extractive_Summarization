by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 04:43 est , 9 april 2013 behind @entity3 ’s public shield of unyielding confidence there was one area of private doubt : what kind of mother had she been ? she had no misgivings about making her twins @entity10 and @entity12 , born when she was 27 , fit in with her professional and political life			1
they slept in the nanny ’s room from the day they were brought home			2
as @entity3 said in her 1996 memoir @entity20 : ‘ to be a mother and housewife is a vocation of a very high kind			2
but i simply felt that it was not the whole of my vocation			2
i knew that i also wanted a career			2
’ family time : @entity3 with sir @entity30 and children @entity10 and @entity12 in 1959 countless women with ambition go through the same emotional wringer			1
as things turned out , she doted on @entity10 , the elder by two minutes , but developed an awkward relationship with the more independent @entity12			1
@entity10 ended up with a fortune , widely perceived to have come about simply because he was @entity3 ’s much - loved son			1
but there is plenty of evidence to show that even though she was n’t as close to @entity12 , she loved and cared for her every bit as much , especially in her desire to see her married — a dream that was never fulfilled			1
according to one friend , the difference in her maternal relationships with her children — born in 1953 when she was a barrister , six years before she entered @entity50 — was that she ‘ calculated that @entity12 was tougher than @entity10 and therefore needed less of a push ’			1
the root of journalist @entity12 ’s uneasy relationship with her mother was her dismay , held since early childhood , that @entity10 was the favourite			1
‘ as a child i was frightened of her , ’ she has said			0
‘ i always felt i came second of the two			2
@entity60 is not the right word , but i never felt i made the grade			2
’ leisure time : @entity3 playing the piano for husband @entity30 and their seventeen year - old twins children @entity10 and @entity12 in 1970 in the mid-nineties , when @entity12 was 43 and @entity10 was married to his first wife @entity68 and living with their children in @entity71 , @entity12 let out her feelings of frustration and inadequacy			1
‘ @entity10 is married to a beautiful girl , has two fabulous children and various mansions scattered around the world			1
‘ i ’m an ancient spinster of no fixed abode living in a rented holiday flat in a ski resort			0
i still do n’t measure up awfully well on the @entity83			0
’ a lifetime of frustration is encompassed in this outpouring			0
and it is hard not to conclude the blame for this must lie with mrs @entity3			0
as the late @entity92 grandee @entity91 noted : ‘ a different note comes into her ( @entity30 ’s ) voice when she speaks about @entity10			1
she obviously dotes on him			0
’ the result , perhaps , was inevitable — a daughter who felt second best			2
@entity3 and businessman @entity30 had been married for two years when the twins ( only one child was expected ) were born while their father was watching cricket at the @entity102			1
becoming leader : the @entity3 strolling through the grounds of @entity105 in @entity106 where they were tenants of a @entity107 flat in 1979 with their parents working — @entity3 was attached to legal chambers in @entity110 and @entity30 travelled a lot — the babies were put into the care of a full - time nanny			1
somewhat bitterly , @entity12 noted in her memoir : ‘ i do n’t think they ( her parents ) can have relished being in charge on nanny ’s day off			1
’ the twins were five in 1958 when mrs @entity3 was adopted as the conservative candidate for @entity122 , the safe @entity124 constituency she would win the following year and represent until leaving @entity50 in 1992			0
so was @entity10 and @entity12 ’s childhood really as sterile as has been made out ? far from it			1
there were riding lessons and skiing holidays , and their mother established a lifelong rule about family weekends			2
as sir @entity133 , her @entity134 private secretary , recalls : ‘ she ’d often say “ weekends are for the family ” and would never disturb me unless there was a running crisis			0
’ years later , mrs @entity3 , who had grown up in a ‘ frugal and very purposeful household ’ above her father ’s grocer ’s shop in @entity145 , @entity146 , told the adult @entity12 she ’d wanted her children ‘ to have the opportunities i had n’t had ’			1
proud parents : @entity3 and @entity30 at the @entity151 for their son @entity10 's wedding as @entity12 recalled : ‘ when it came to being a mother , she [ gave ] @entity10 and me the opportunity to make up our own minds			1
that meant anything from being allowed to choose the wallpaper in our bedrooms [ which mrs @entity3 always decorated herself ] to church being optional each sunday			0
’ sir @entity133 says : ‘ @entity3 used to say : “ i ’m not the kind of nurse that says : ‘ there , there , i ’ll fluff up the pillows			0
’ i ’m the kind who gets [ the children ] out of bed after the operation because it ’s for their own good			0
” ’ by the time they were sent to boarding school — @entity10 at eight , @entity12 at nine — they were so used to their mother being away at work that neither suffered from home sickness			1
yet @entity12 would never forget that when she won a prize on sports day , neither parent was there to see her receive it			1
as for @entity10 , he may have been ‘ mummy ’s boy ’ , but she was not soft with him			1
when he wanted to drop out of skiing lessons because he was cold , she refused to allow it			0
‘ she said he would be perfectly fine and had to suffer , ’ recalls a family friend			0
‘ he did n’t like it			0
’ sir @entity133 has no doubt that while @entity3 was hardly a conventional parent , ‘ she was certainly a caring and loving mother ’			2
and there is no doubt that , as @entity12 recalled , her mother ‘ fell apart			1
completely unable to function ’ when @entity10 went missing for six days in 1982 in the @entity198 while driving in the @entity199			2
just how far @entity3 was prepared to take her love for @entity10 has , for years , been a matter of speculation			2
from having failed his accountancy exams and struggling to establish himself in business , @entity204 suddenly emerged in the late @entity207 as a multi-millionaire			0
reports have suggested he was enriched with huge commissions as a silent middle man in arms and construction deals negotiated in the @entity215 states by his mother			2
pulling together : @entity3 at sir @entity30 ' funeral in @entity124 in 2003 , supported by @entity12 and @entity10 of course , mrs @entity3 was not complicit in her son ’s business arrangements			1
she implacably denied there had been any impropriety or that her son had grown rich on the back of her efforts for @entity226			0
as @entity3 reached the final years of her life , she saw divorced @entity10 happily remarried , while @entity12 remained single			1
there was surprise , and some distaste , when @entity12 ’s memoir , published five years ago , discussed her mother ’s dementia and revealed she could n’t remember what she ’d had for breakfast that morning			1
nor did sir @entity10 or @entity12 spend as much time in their frail and forgetful mother ’s company — especially at @entity239 — as friends felt they should			1
their visits to her @entity243 home were rare			0
‘ look , you ca n’t have everything , ’ an elderly @entity3 said some years ago in a revealing interview with retirement magazine saga			0
‘ it has been the greatest privilege being prime minister of my country			0
yes , i wish i saw more of my children			0
we do n’t have sunday lunch together ; we do n’t go on holiday skiing any more			0
‘ but i ca n’t regret			0
and i have n’t lost my children			0
i took a different life			0
