by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 3 august 2012 the war over chicken sandwiches escalated today as gay rights advocates revealed plans for a ' @entity5 ' at @entity6 to counter the hundreds of thousands of people who lined drive - through lanes and filled dining rooms at the restaurants across the nation on wednesday			1
the fast food chain said it enjoyed record - setting sales thanks to ' @entity15 , ' which seemed to achieve its goal of backing the company 's ' christian principles ' by asking supporters to vote with their feet and their dollars			0
liberal groups are furious at the fast food chain after ceo @entity24 was quoted as saying he supports the ' biblical definition of marriage ' and that the @entity27 was ' inviting @entity29 's judgement ' by supporting gay marriage			1
conservatives , including top politicians and pundits like former vice presidential candidate @entity34 and @entity36 commentator @entity35 , have rallied to the defense of the company -- citing concerns over freedom of speech and freedom of religion			0
photos emerged from across the nation -- from @entity69 to @entity70 to @entity53 and @entity71 -- of patrons waiting for hours to support the company			1
' it 's gone beyond anything i could have imagined , ' @entity35 , a former @entity74 presidential candidate , told @entity36			0
' every one of ( the stores ) that i know have reported record , historic sales yesterday ... a lot of the stores ran out of chicken before the end of the day			2
' @entity6 says it had nothing to do with planning the rally that brought customers to its stores in droves , but it appreciated the business			2
should @entity6 be free to voice their support for the biblical definition of marriage ? ' we are very grateful and humbled by the incredible turnout of loyal @entity6 customers on august 1 at @entity6 restaurants around the country , ' the company said in a statement			1
it added : ' while we do n't release exact sales numbers , we can confirm reports that it was a record - setting day			0
' gay rights groups like the @entity108 are firing back on friday by encouraging gay couples to ' show @entity6 thanks for their support of @entity112 , @entity113 , and the @entity114 ! ' by smooching at the restaurant and photographing the evidence			2
organizers do n't recommend eating at @entity6 and are encouraging their supporters to visit @entity119			2
mockery : the @entity66 group for the @entity122 plays off the @entity123 ' with the motto ' kiss mor chicks ' show of faith : a pair of nuns were photographed walking out of a @entity6 on wednesday loaded with food , milkshakes and iced tea competition : a @entity136 's franchise owner in @entity137 had several of his stores post support for @entity6 on their marquee signs a 20 - year - old gay man and self - described liberal supporter of president @entity144 , made a surprising announcement when he revealed he would continue eating at @entity6 the man , who gave his name only as @entity148 , wrote in a column for @entity150 that ' @entity151 has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he does n't support same - sex marriage			1
' he argues that @entity151 has a right to his opinion and he respects @entity6 for closing on sundays out of principle			0
@entity148 writes that when gay rights activist ' push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement , ' the results will not be favorable			2
' i 'm a gay man			2
i love @entity6 as a place to get good tasting food			0
i do not support their beliefs and disagree with their funding of groups that are well known to be anti-gay activists			0
personally they have never treated me any different as a gay man and i will continue to do business with them so long as that holds true , ' he writes			2
despite their efforts , the protest is unlikely to come close to matching the impact of @entity6 appreciation day -- only 11,000 @entity66 users have said they plan to attend ' @entity187			1
' not all gay people support the boycott , though			0
a 20 - year - old gay man , who said he is a liberal who supports president @entity144 , wrote a piece for @entity150 in which he defended @entity151 's right to oppose gay marriage			1
the man said he planned to continue eating at @entity6 because he thinks the reaction of gay rights groups has been overblown -- and their southern - style chicken sandwiches taste good , too			1
as opponents regroup , @entity6 is finding even more supporters -- including the owner of competing fast food restaurants			1
@entity203 , the biggest @entity136 's franchise owner in the world , posted ' we stand with @entity6 ' on the signs outside several of his restaurants in @entity208 , reported @entity209 in @entity210			1

roman catholic cardinal @entity223 , the leader of the @entity224 , also sided with @entity6 when he criticized @entity71 mayor @entity225 for blasting the company 's anti-gay marriage stance			1
the mayor said the chain 's values ' are not @entity71 's values ' and said he did not welcome plans to build additional restaurants in @entity71			1
face off : when @entity71 mayor @entity225 said that @entity6 's values ' are not @entity71 's values , ' cardinal @entity223 said the mayor 's view does n't represent the @entity237 who support ' traditional marriage ' controversy : ceo @entity24 drew ire from gay rights groups with his comments about same sex marriage that opinion was shared and repeated by the mayors of @entity245 and @entity246 , as well			1
@entity225 's words , along with a vow by @entity250 ' @entity249 to block any expansion in the city , drew @entity223 's ire			2
' i was born and raised here , and my understanding of being a @entity71 never included submitting my value system to the government for approval			0

' @entity151 says @entity6 is n't a @entity294 company -- however its stores are all closed on sunday , even in airports and shopping malls , and his company biography says the purpose of his business is to ' glorify @entity29 by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us			1
' opposition : gay rights supporter @entity306 stood outside the @entity6 in @entity307 , @entity53 , on wednesday with a rainbow flag to protest the chain 's opposition to gay marriage picketing : the massive crowds drew handfuls of gay rights protestors to @entity6 on wednesday @entity6 also puts its money where its mouth is , donating $ 5 million to @entity294 groups between 2003 and 2010			2
