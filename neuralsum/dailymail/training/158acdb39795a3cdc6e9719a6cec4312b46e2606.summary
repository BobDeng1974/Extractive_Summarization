these inspiring images may look like the promotional photos for the next @entity2 , but in fact the subjects are normal office workers - without using @entity5			1
when @entity9 snapper @entity7 was asked to take photos of the staff at the offices of @entity13 , a photography website , he captured them posed as elite athletes			1
using great lighting and a homemade rain machine , the staff , which included a 61 - year - old grandfather and grandmother , 62 , were transformed into muscular , chiseled athletic beings			1
and still , somehow , he manages to make me look great ! ' day look : @entity24 , pictured with her three dogs , was given a makeover to look like an athlete ' we took 2000 shots in a single day in order to produce fewer than 20 final photographs , ' @entity7 says			1
' i think that people were quite blown away by the results â€” they 'd never really thought that they could look so awesome			1
' they 'd come to the computer , check out the images , and run back to shoot some more			0
' front office executive @entity40 , 24 , was transformed by @entity7 's lens into a top fitness instructor			1
' when people saw the photos it was a lot of shock and awe			2
i did n't even think i looked like that , ' she says grandmother @entity24 , snapped from behind looking magnificent lifting dumbbells said : ' i 'm a 62 - year - old grandma			1
and still , somehow , he manages to make me look great ! ' @entity52 , a 61 - year - old grandfather of 12 , looks equally impressive photographed on a bike with his well - defined arms on show			1
mother - of - three , @entity56 , is captured looking like a champion weightlifter with a perfectly toned body holding a bar			2
@entity52 , a 61 - year - old grandfather of 12 , looks impressive on a bike with his well - defined arms on show ordinary people : @entity52 , 61 , pictured with two of his 12 grandchildren front office executive @entity40 , 24 , has been trasformed by @entity7 's lens into a top fitness instructor			1
' when people saw the photos it was a lot of shock and awe			2
i did n't even think i looked like that , ' she admits			0
@entity7 says he set out to create something out of the ordinary			1
mother - of - three , @entity56 , is captured looking like a champion weightlifter with a perfectly toned body holding a bar taking it easy : @entity56 is pictured working out on her laptop - not at the gym ' the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks black and white portraiture is old school , classical , traditional			2
but @entity7 says he wanted to create something edgy , impactful and extreme			1
' with only a couple days to pull something together , i had @entity13 's facilities manager build a rain machine for me with a $ 10 budget and a couple hours of hard work			0
' so what are @entity7 's tips to creating transformative photography ? a tire and rope combined with the right expression gave a sense of movement and life , says @entity7 not a professional athlete ! the model sporting his every day look ... a far cry from the photo above ' make the ordinary extraordinary			2
' keeping an open mind on how to leverage the environment around you is key to doing great work			0
' a simple tire and rope combined with the right expression gave images a sense of movement and life			0
' ' both are slightly awkward objects with no classic way to photograph them so being open to experiment until the image makes sense is key to getting great shots			0
these inspiring images may look like the promotional photos for the next @entity2 but in fact they show normal office workers pictured as athletes working out ... one of @entity132 's models doing her day job at a computer so what 's the key to creating that incredible definition ? ' when you 're trying to carve out muscle and definition hard edgy and directional lighting works best			2
' in my case i used four lights to achieve the effect i wanted , but you can pull off something pretty similar with just two lights in soft boxes at 90 degrees from your models			0
he adds : ' tweak the lighting and camera as much as you want to prep your set , but once everything is all ready to go focus on talking your model through different movements , exercises , expressions especially if they 're not professional models			0
' with only a couple days to pull something together , i had @entity13 's facilities manager build a rain machine for me with a $ 10 budget and a couple hours of hard work , ' says @entity7 and without the rain machine and piece of rope ... the unnamed model sporting her every - day look ' even if they are , letting them know that they 're looking amazing as you 're shooting is as helpful as coffee in the morning			1
' ' regardless if you go for a black and white or colour , the main focus of the image has to always be the subject in question			0
' make sure that distractions are removed and that your subjects pop into focus first and foremost			0
and ... scream ! an office worker is transformed into a professional - looking athlete by @entity7 not a weightlifter ... the model pictured before @entity7 's incredible transformation ' in my case , any distracting or bright raindrops were toned down just a little bit and a soft vignette was masked in so that my subjects in the centre would pop out just a little bit more			1
most of all , says @entity7 , it 's about being brave			2
' there are no rules if the only requirement is to make people look awesome			0
do n't limit yourself to the same safe shots , try different things			0
you never know what you 'll discover			0
' do n't focus on the resources you do n't have , focus on being resourceful			0
' out of the park ! @entity7 's simple techniques result in everyday office workers looking like athletes and what he usually looks like ... the unnamed model pictured with his pet pooch when @entity9 photographer @entity220 was asked to take photos of the staff at the offices of @entity13 , a photography website , he decided to capture them posed as elite athletes ' there are no rules if the only requirement is to make people look awesome , ' says @entity7			1
