by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 12:49 est , 20 july 2012 is it time to trade polished sheaths and all - business suits for lace gowns and tweed jodhpurs ? mad men , with its influential @entity8 style , was overlooked for an @entity10 nomination on thursday for costume design for the first time in its five - year run			1
and while fans expressed shock about the snub , the fashion world has already embraced another nominee : @entity19			2
snubbed : despite the impact of the mid-sixties looks in the latest season of @entity6 , worn to great effect by @entity25 as @entity26 ( pictured ) , the series failed to get an emmy costume design nomination style with substance : from ' @entity31 ' ( left ) to @entity33 's more senior position and eventual departure from @entity6 - @entity35 ( right ) , the costumes in @entity6 's fifth series told the story of each character episodes of @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 also received nominations , but the likelihood of the masses finding their closets influenced by medieval @entity47 or mythical adventurers seems slim			1
the @entity50 aristocracy of the early 1900s featured in @entity19 , however , is already making its mark			2
recognition : @entity19 , starring @entity52 as @entity53 ( left ) and @entity54 as @entity55 ( right ) , was given an emmy nomination for costume design inspired : @entity58 took heavy inspiration form @entity19 for his fall 2012 collection , even sending models down the catwalk to the hit @entity65 show 's theme music @entity58 paid homage to the show in the preview of his fall collection earlier this year , with models walking down the runway to the soundtrack			1
expect more glamorous and embellished looks inspired by the show to take over store racks over the next few weeks , says @entity76 , director of fashion accessories at @entity78			2
' there is a return to opulence , ' @entity79 says			0
stylist @entity83 , co-host for @entity85 's @entity84 , noted that gentlemanly looks , for men and women , come from the @entity90 period			0
historically accurate : the attention to detail in the outfits for @entity39 , starring @entity93 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) , won the @entity96 series an @entity10 costume design nomination too ' designers are influenced by the same things as stylists : movies , tv , music , art - whatever is the zeitgeist , ' he says			1
costume party : the designs for @entity41 won the series an emmy nomination for the past few years , it had been the chic , sophisticated @entity6 look that dominated the fashion conversation , and the show had a wildfire ability to turn back the clock on contemporary style to embrace the clean , refined lines of the early 1960s			1
countless designers , including @entity120 and @entity121 , cited its influence , and @entity124 launched a @entity6 - branded collection			0
' the shape had been the same for a while - the shaped waist , the va - va - voom look , ' @entity126 says			0
when it became common from @entity6 , he says , ' it becomes less interesting to fashion people			0
' he does n't think the look will go away altogether , though			0
' women looked good in the @entity136 and @entity8 because the clothes were universally flattering , and any guy looks great in a suit			0
' @entity140 , @entity141 ; @entity142 , @entity143 ; @entity144 , assistant costume designer @entity145 , costume designer @entity146 , @entity141 ; @entity147 , @entity148 @entity149 , @entity141 ; @entity150 , assistant costume designer ; @entity151 , assistant costume designer @entity152 , @entity141 ; @entity153 , assistant costume designer			1
