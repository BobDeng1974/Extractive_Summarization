a @entity1 fisherman got the shock of his life when he reeled in his fishing line to find this monster on the end			2
@entity7 was fishing from a dock in @entity9 as he watched a fellow fisherman pull this strange creature out of the water			2
mr @entity7 described the giant sea creature as being about 18 inches long			0
the shrimp was striking its own tail , so the fisherman grabbed it by its back like a lobster			0
@entity19 @entity7 was fishing from a dock in @entity9 when he saw this massive shrimp from the @entity22 described it as about 18 inches long and said he grabbed it like a lobster the @entity26 said they are stumped as to the exact species of the underwater creature			0
but they believe it could be some type of mantis shrimp - which is actually neither a mantis nor a shrimp at all , but a kind of crustacean called a stomatopod			1
these creatures may can reach 12 inches in length , or even longer in exceptional cases - which would put this catch at the extreme end of the scale			2
the mantis shrimp is one of the major invertebrate predators on coral reefs , sea grass beds and sand and rubble flats , but relatively little is known about the species			1
but the creatures are known for their large stalked compound eyes , which give them incredibly complex vision			0
they live in crevices or in burrows that they build themselves and are surprisingly agile			0
the second distinctive feature of the mantis shrimp is the powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing , stunning or even dismemberment			1
experts believe the underwater creature could be some species of the mantis shrimp this has earned the creatures the nickname ' thumb splitters ' â€“ due to their ability to inflict painful gashes using their claws if handled incautiously in captivity , some of the larger species of mantis shrimp are capable of breaking through glass with a single strike			1
there are thought to be more than 400 species of mantis shrimp , coming in a variety of colours , from shades of brown to distinctive bright neon			1
some of the brighter species use the fluorescent patterns on their bodies behavioural signals for contacting other mantis shrimp			1
they have surprisingly developed memories and are able to recognise individual neighbours that they have interacted with on a frequent basis previously			0
. the crustaceans can also recognise each other by visual signs and even by individual smell , and many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals .			0

the alien - like creature was pulled from the water in @entity1
experts believe the catch to be some kind of mantis shrimp
