as @entity1 and @entity2 tore into each other over chewy topics like @entity5 and tax during last night 's tv debate , there was only one subject preoccupying tens of thousands of viewers - the vice president 's glaring toothy grin			1
within minutes of the debate starting , @entity12 was abuzz with users taken aback by @entity1 's behaviour and sent out mocking messages			1
one parodied his a trademark soundbite : ' for those brief moments you do n't see a # @entity21 on my face , know that i 've got a # @entity24 in my heart			0
while his smile was dismissed as patronising @entity2 , his teeth could have been part of a shock and awe tactic on his opponent			0
@entity44 , a ' dentist to the stars ' based in @entity46 , told @entity47 she thought @entity1 had been fitted with either a full set of porcelain veneers or a porcelain bridge , at an estimated cost of around $ 20,000			1
@entity53 operatives used the @entity12 hashtag ' # bidenunhinged ' to mock the vice president 's exuberant performance			1
the @entity57 posted an online campaign ad overnight featuring a full minute of him laughing followed by the message , ' vice president @entity1 is laughing ... are you ? ' untamed : moderator @entity63 could not curb the vice president 's nonstop amusement finger - wagging : some found @entity1 's unusual mannerisms off - putting and disrespectful no knockout : @entity2 managed to survive @entity1 's attacks despite his mocking tone some compared @entity1 's laughter to @entity75 's notorious sighs in the 2000 presidential debates , a mannerism which many voters felt made him look unprofessional			1
' that condescending , smirking , laughing - it was akin to @entity75 's sigh , ' @entity57 strategist @entity80 told @entity84			2
@entity85 , former press secretary for @entity86 , tweeted : ' @entity1 is at risk of having his laugh come across like @entity75 's sighs			2
he should knock it off			0
' still smiling : @entity1 grins as he meets his rival 's wife , @entity91 meme me : inevitably internet jokers decided to add their own interpretations to the reason behind the smirk @entity98 : this one pokes fun at @entity1 's most memorable quote during the debate fool : @entity1 annoyed many for constantly interrupting @entity2 while others quoted the @entity106 to mock the vp even some @entity109 supporters criticised the behaviour , such as liberal film critic @entity111 , who tweeted : ' @entity1 ! stop smiling and laughing ! ' but other @entity1 fans were pleased with their man 's performance - strategist @entity113 said , ' i think he genuinely thought that @entity2 ’s attempts to nitpick and cast aspersions on the administration ’s foreign policy was laughable			1
' body language experts were unimpressed by the grinning			0
@entity122 , author of an upcoming book on the practice , said : ' that mugging , those condescending looks - it was a complete turnoff			0
he was bullying , he was smug , he interrupted ... i think he lost a lot of his message based on facial gestures			0
