psychedelic drugs such as lsd and magic mushrooms do not cause mental health problems in users , a new study has claimed			1
researchers in @entity7 have said they in fact found ' significant associations ' between the drugs and fewer psychological problems			1

a new study claims the use of psychedelic drugs including @entity1 ( pictured ) and magic mushrooms does not cause mental health problems clinical psychologist @entity25 , who carried out the study with researcher @entity27 , said : ' after adjusting for other risk factors , lifetime use of @entity1 , psilocybin , mescaline or peyote , or past year use of @entity1 was not associated with a higher rate of mental health problems or receiving mental health treatment			1
' the team studied the 2001 - 2004 @entity37 on @entity38 and @entity39 which asked people about mental health conditions including general psychological distress , anxiety disorders , mood disorders , and psychosis			2
@entity27 and @entity25 used the data to investigate connections between the use of psychedelic drugs and the mental health issues			0
the researchers said rather than finding a connection between their use and an increase in problems , they discovered long - term use of drugs such as psilocybin or mescaline was linked to ' lower rates of serious psychological distress '			1
meanwhile , people who had used @entity1 in the last 12 months were also associated with lower rates of distress , while those who had used the drug long - term had a lower rate of treatment for mental health issues			1

' the researchers pointed out that recent trials ' have also failed to find any evidence of any lasting harmful effects of psychedelics '			0
@entity27 said : ' everything has some potential for negative effects , but psychedelic use is overall considered to pose a very low risk to the individual and to society			0
