@entity0 and @entity1 have always known they are different but the same			1
while @entity0 is a high - achieving , sporty and confident 11 - year - old , his twin @entity3 has @entity5 , delayed speech and deafness			1

eleven - year - old @entity12 ( right , form @entity13 , @entity9 , is very protective of his twin brother @entity3 ( left ) , who suffers from @entity5 , delayed speech and deafness the boys ' mum , @entity16 , said : ‘ they have always been extremely close			1
they have a very unique and special bond			0
they are n’t just twin brothers , they are best of mates too			0
' i ’ve always told them they are very special and have different talents and skills that are unique to themselves			0
‘ @entity0 is very protective over @entity3 - who looks up to his twin in a big brotherly way			1
’ and now ever protective @entity0 has sold all his old toys and books to help his brother ’s education			1
over the last year he has raised over £ 400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school @entity3 attends			1
@entity16 , a businesswoman , said : ‘ he ’s had table top sales , a party and placed collection boxes in shops to raise money			0
‘ and now he is in the process of establishing his own registered charity to carry on supporting the school which means so much to @entity3			1
’ entrepreneurial and caring @entity0 started fundraising as he wanted to give something back to @entity50 , who have supported @entity3 for the last five years			1
over the last year @entity0 has raised over £ 400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school @entity3 attends bursting with pride , @entity16 said : ‘ he has always had such a loving personality and been so protective over @entity3			1
‘ he told me recently that when he is older he wants to run his own business so he can always look after @entity3			2
he wants to be able to buy him a house and make sure he has all the care he ever needs			0
‘ i feel so proud of @entity0 - he really is a very caring child			2
‘ when @entity3 was younger , his speech was badly affected , so @entity0 along with ourselves learnt sign language so @entity3 could communicate with us			1
‘ @entity0 never moaned about it - quite the opposite			2
he did n’t want @entity3 to feel different so enthusiastically learnt the signs			2
‘ but they have also have their own way of communication - sometimes i ca n’t quite decipher what @entity3 has said , but @entity0 always knows and will explain for me			1
‘ i just put it down to the fact that they are twins and incredibly close			0
’ so @entity0 ’s latest mission to help @entity3 does n’t come as any surprise to @entity16 and her husband , @entity74			1

they have a very unique and special bond			0
they are n’t just twin brothers , they are best of mates too ' @entity0 , who is clearly very keen to support his brother ’s school , said : ‘ i decided it was a good idea because it does quite a lot for people born with disabilities and i wanted to do something for them			1

' @entity16 added : ‘ we have been completely overwhelmed by @entity0 's determination and enthusiasm			1
‘ @entity0 told us he had lots of toys and books that he no longer needed and wanted to put them to something useful			2
’ despite being born a minute after @entity3 , @entity0 has always taken on the big brother role			1
@entity16 recalls : ‘ when they were little @entity0 would always keep a very watchful eye on @entity3			1
if he fell over in the park , he was the first one to come to his aid and make sure he was okay			0
‘ and there has been the odd occasion where @entity3 has been the victim of nasty comments from other kids			2
a boy once hit @entity149 immediately jumped to @entity3 ’s defence and told the lad to leave him alone			2
‘ on their first day at school , @entity0 kept a very close eye on @entity3 , knowing how hard it would be for him			1
‘ he made sure he was never alone and that he had everything he needed			0
and ever since he has been like @entity3 ’s right - hand man			2

in fact he constantly encourages and teaches him			0
‘ @entity0 is very patient			0
he has helped teach @entity3 how to ride his bike , play football and show him how to use the @entity162			0
he never allows him to be left out of anything			0
‘ i used to worry about what would happen when @entity3 got older , how he would cope with adult life , if he would be able to live independently			0
but i know now that he will always have @entity149 to help him and with his brother by his side , he will never be alone in life			0
