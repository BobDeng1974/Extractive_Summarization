this is the moment a tearful @entity2 mother and her two daughters knelt down to beg forgiveness from the parents of a student who died while saving the two girls ' lives			1
the youngsters , aged seven and nine , had gone with their mother @entity10 at the end of last month to visit a man - made lake near the village of @entity14 in @entity15 , in central @entity18 's @entity17 province			2
but as they were playing on the side of the lake , the younger of the girls - named @entity19 - slipped and started to fall towards the water , and when her sister @entity23 went to grab her , she fell in as well			0
@entity10 and her two daughters beg the parents of the man who died saving them for forgiveness @entity31 drowned after rescuing the two girls pictured , but their mother failed to report it for fear of a compensation claim both girls were wearing winter coats and it was clear they would not survive long as they struggled to get back to the shore			1
the girl 's mother , who was unable to swim herself , started screaming , alerting a nearby university student named @entity31 who ran over to help			2
without thinking of his own safety , @entity31 jumped into the water to rescue the girls , @entity47 reported			1
he managed to throw the youngest girl from the steep - sided quarry lake back onto the bank , plucking her from below the surface where she had started to sink , and then pushed the older girl towards the bank where she was grabbed by her mother and pulled to safety			0
@entity31 ( pictured ) , 24 , died dragging two young girls to safety from a man - made lake but the intense cold and exertion had left the 24 - year - old student so weakened that he sank below the surface seconds later and vanished from sight			1
yet incredibly , instead of raising the alarm , the girls ' mother had been terrified that she would end up in trouble and possibly a compensation claim from the boy 's family , and had told the girls to say nothing			1
instead , she had taken them home , dried them and changed their clothes , and acted as if nothing had happened			0
however , she did not realise that the drama had been watched by fishermen on the other side , who had raised the alarm with police			0
after divers investigated , they recovered the young man 's body , and then started trying to work out if other people were involved in his death			1
that eventually led them to the girls and their mother @entity10 , who had initially denied knowing anything about the tragedy but later admitted what she had done			0
so as the young man was being prepared for the funeral , she and her daughters turned up dressed in black together with all their savings , a total of @entity100 ( £ 1,000 ) , and offered it to the parents of the dead student to make amends			2
she said : ' i forced my girls to say nothing , it was my decision , and all the shame is mine			0
' i offer you my apology and my tribute to your son who saved the lives of my two daughters			0
' after seeing the two children in tears alongside the mother , the parents of the dead boy accepted the apology			2
they also told them to keep the money , saying it would not bring back their son but their admission of what he had done at least restored honour to his death			0
mourners lay wreaths at the funeral of 24 - year - old student @entity31 , whose body was found by police mr @entity31 's parents forgave the mother of the two girls and declined her offer of £ 1,000 , saying her apology was enough to restore honour to their son 's name			1
