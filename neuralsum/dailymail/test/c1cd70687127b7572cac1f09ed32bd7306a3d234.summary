ex pop star : rev @entity1 rose to fame as half of the band @entity5 when a high - profile vicar yesterday attacked the @entity9 plans to sell housing association homes as a ‘ right to steal ’ , it might have sounded like a stern ticking off from the pulpit			1
but this was the @entity2 @entity1 – who sits on the board of @entity15 , a housing association in @entity17 – and he is no ordinary churchman			1
known to many for presenting @entity20 ’s gentle human interest show @entity21 , he is the supposed inspiration for the hero of the @entity25 church sitcom @entity2 and while he might now feel free to attack others for seeking the right to buy their own home , he not so long ago felt he had the right to do whatever he chose himself , regardless of the law or anyone else ’s feelings			1
for @entity34 raised eyebrows by last year publishing a frank memoir which detailed not only his rise to fame as half of the famously gay 1980s pop band @entity5 , alongside singer @entity41 , but also his enthusiasm for ‘ dogging ’ – having sex with strangers in the open air – and for taking drugs including cocaine , ecstasy and amphetamines			1
he also confessed that he falsely told his friends that he was @entity51 positive , to generate attention and sympathy , and kept up the unpleasant pretence for five years			1

last october he warned his parishioners to ‘ brace themselves ’ for the publication of his biography @entity70 , and said shortly after : ‘ i had n’t realised quite how eventful my life had been until i sat down to write about it			2
the truth is , country parsons often have a more vivid past than you might think			2
’ born in @entity17 to shoemaker parents , @entity1 was sent to public school and it was while he was a chorister there that he realised he was gay			2
@entity1 , 52 , is now a regular on tv and radio , but on sundays he performs at his 14th century parish church , @entity58 , in @entity59 , @entity17 within a few years he had taken a drug overdose , saying that in the 1970s being gay ‘ was like being a paedophile now – it was a life which seemed to offer only disgrace ’			2
he moved to @entity84 , however , met @entity41 , and they formed @entity5			0
their song @entity86 went to number one and was the best - selling single of 1986			0
but @entity1 remained unhappy , jealous of @entity92 ’s fame and feeling geeky himself			0
he took large quantities of drugs , apparently spending a whole year in @entity95 on speed and ecstasy , and taking lsd			1
he believes the ecstasy was sometimes laced with heroin			1
he eventually conquered his shyness with other men when he discovered a lay - by where he could meet strangers and have sex in the woods at night			0
he described the discovery of this dogging spot as ‘ one of the great liberations of my life			0
having lots of casual and anonymous sex with strangers ’			0
