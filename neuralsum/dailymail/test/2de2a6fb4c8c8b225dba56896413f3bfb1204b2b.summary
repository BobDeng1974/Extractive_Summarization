it is the age - old trick of students the world over - pulling all - nighters to cram for an exam			0
but a team of experts at @entity6 in @entity7 have a few words of wisdom , urging students to put down the coffee and sleep			1
they believe the memory neurons that are responsible for converting short - term memories into long - term ones , work most effectively when a person is asleep			1
scientists have long known that sleep , memory and learning are deeply connected			1
most animals , from flies to humans , have trouble remembering when they are sleep - deprived			2
and studies have shown that sleep is critical in converting short - term memories , into long - term memory , a process known as memory consolidation			1
a team of scientists at @entity6 in @entity7 believe all - nighters to cram before an exam wo n't work because the process converting short - term memory to long - term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep but just how that process works has remained a mystery			1
one body of thinking questions whether the mechanism that promotes sleep is also responsible for consolidating memory			2
while another asks if the two distinct process work together			0
in other words , is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet , allowing memory neurons to go to work , or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep ? graduate students , @entity58 and @entity59 , at the university 's @entity60 , believe the answer is the latter			1
they focused their research on dorsal paired medial neurons , well - known memory consolidators in fruit flies			1
the pair noted , for the first time , that when the neurons are activated , the flies slept more , but when they were deactivated , the flies kept buzzing			0
these memory consolidators cause the flies to fall asleep , as they begin to convert short - term memory to long - term memory			1
ms @entity58 and ms @entity59 said this all takes place in a section of the fly 's brain called the mushroom body - similar to the hippocampus in humans , which is where our memories are stored			0
the parts of the fly 's mushroom body , which is responsible for memory and learning is the same part that keeps it awake			0
the hippocampus in the brain , highlighted in red , is where our memories are stored , and where , the scientists believe the process takes place ms @entity59 , said : ' it 's almost as if that section of the mushroom body were saying , " hey , stay awake and learn this "			0
' then , after a while , the @entity107 neurons start signaling to suppress that section , as if to say , " you 're going to need sleep if you want to remember this later "			2
' understanding how sleep and memory are connected in a simple system , like fruit flies , can help scientists unravel the secrets of the human brain			2
' knowing that sleep and memory overlap in the fly brain can allow researchers to narrow their search in humans , ' ms @entity59 said			0
' eventually , it could help us figure out how sleep or memory is affected when things go wrong , as in the case of insomnia or memory disorders			0
' this research was funded by the @entity134 .			0

memory neurons that *covert* short - term memory to long - term work most effectively when a person is asleep , scientists believe
@entity6 scientists believe memory neurons put us to sleep
say you need to sleep to consolidate and remember what you *'ve* learned
