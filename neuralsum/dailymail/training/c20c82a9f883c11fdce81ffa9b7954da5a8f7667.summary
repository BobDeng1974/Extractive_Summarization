@entity1 's father has said that he thinks his son will return to the @entity3 so long as the attorney general agrees not to detain him before his inevitable trial			1
a clip of an interview with @entity8 aired on @entity9 friday morning where the @entity12 leaker 's father confirmed that he sent a list of demands to the @entity16 that he feels will pave the way for his 30 - year - old son to return from @entity19			1
the elder @entity8 came up with the list with the help of his lawyer but with no consultation from @entity1 since the two have not spoken since april , two months before @entity8 released classified intelligence documents			1
watch the video here paternal support : @entity8 spoke with @entity29 and confirmed that he sent a letter to the attorney general 's office with a list of conditions he feels will allow @entity1 to return on his own accord ' at this point i do n't believe he 's committed treason , ' @entity8 told @entity29 's @entity38			1
' he has in fact broken @entity3 law in the sense that he has released classified information and if folks want to classify him as a traitor - in fact he has betrayed his government but i do n't believe he has betrayed the people of the @entity3			2
' in his letter , mr @entity8 reportedly wrote that @entity1 was likely to come back to the @entity3 on his own so long as the @entity16 agree not to subject him to a gag order , allow him to pick where his trial will take place , and make sure that he is not detained before said trial			1
it seems unlikely that the federal government will meet the demands , as they have already filed a number of charges against @entity1 including several under the @entity57			2
on the run : @entity1 is currently believed to be in a transit terminal of a @entity19 airport as he waits for asylum papers from @entity62 during a press conference on thursday in @entity65 , president @entity63 said that he wo n't engage in any ' wheeling , dealing and trading ' to get @entity1 extradited from @entity19 to the @entity3			1
a spokesman for the @entity68 has said that they have blocked access to @entity72 's website following their publication of leaked @entity12 documents			1
@entity75 , a spokesman for the @entity76 , told @entity77 on thursday that they are filtering ' some access to press coverage and online content about the @entity12 leaks			0
' ' we make every effort to balance the need to preserve information access with operational security , however , there are strict policies and directives in place regarding protecting and handling classified information , ' he wrote via email			0
for their part , editors and reporters for @entity72 are publicly revelling in the ban			0
writer @entity98 , who published the initial @entity8 article on june 5 , called the move ' flattering '			0
' i 'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29 - year - old hacker , ' the president said of the whistleblower			0
the younger @entity8 , who turned 30 last week , fled to @entity106 last month ahead of leaking details about an @entity12 surveillance program			0
he is now in the transit area of @entity110 in @entity111			0
the hacker 's father has also cast some doubt on the intentions of @entity116 , the group who has come to the aide of @entity1 while he is in hiding			1
i would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him			0
i do n't want to put him in peril , but i am concerned about those who surround him , ' @entity8 told @entity29			0
' i think @entity116 , if you 've looked at past history - their focus is n't necessarily the @entity126 of the @entity3			2
it 's simply to release as much information as possible and that alone is a concern for me			0
' @entity8 's future remains unclear , as @entity19 president @entity132 has said that they have no plans to extradite him since there is no existing extradition treaty between the @entity3 and @entity19			1
the former consultant is said to be seeking asylum in @entity62 but the process will take months to complete			2
' it took us two months to make a decision in the case of @entity145 , so do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time , ' @entity62 foreign minister @entity140 told reporters			2
defiant : speaking on thursday during his trip to @entity65 , president @entity63 said the @entity3 will not be ' scrambling jets ' to seize @entity1 , saying @entity19 should hand him over through proper legal channels			1

@entity1 's father @entity152 has not spoken to his son since april
@entity155 released the day after @entity72 was blocked on all @entity68 *computers*
@entity152 sent a letter to the @entity16 telling them what conditions should be met if they want @entity1 to return to the @entity3 on his own
says he should be able to pick where his trial is held , they need to say he will not be detained prior to the trial and no gag order will be issued
president @entity63 already said he will not do any ' wheeling , dealing and trading ' to get @entity8 back from @entity19
@entity8 thought to be seeking asylum in @entity62 like @entity116 founder @entity145 *previously* did
