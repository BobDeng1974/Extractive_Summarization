city traders ( depicted here by @entity25 in @entity26 of @entity27 ) are less likely to hold their nerve and make good decisions during times of financial crisis , worsening economic decline the research , published in the @entity31 , tracked the cortisol levels of a group of volunteers placed in conditions similar to a financial trading business			1
the study was designed to mimic earlier research that showed a 68 per cent hike in cortisol levels among real @entity42 traders as market volatility increased over a period of two weeks			2
the researchers found those with higher stress levels were less likely to take risks			0
dr @entity49 , a member of the @entity15 research team and a former @entity27 derivatives trader , said : ‘ any trader knows that their body is taken on roller - coaster ride by the markets			0
what we have n’t known until this study was that these physiological changes - the sub-clinical levels of stress of which we are only dimly aware - are actually altering our ability to take risk			2
‘ it is frightening to realise that no one in the financial world - not the traders , not the risk managers , not the central bankers - knows that these subterranean shifts in risk appetite are taking place			0
’ high levels of the stress hormone cortisol can make city traders less risk - averse and more pessimistic @entity77 , secreted by the adrenal glands , fuels the ‘ fight or flight ’ response that evolved to aid survival in the face of physical threats , such as predators			1
over an eight day period , the volunteers - 20 men and 16 women aged 20 to 36 - were given an artificial form of cortisol that raised their levels of the stress hormone by 69 per cent , mimicking the increase seen previously in traders			2
initial spikes of cortisol had little effect on behaviour , but over time the willingness of participants to take risks fell dramatically			0
dr @entity49 added : ‘ traders , risk managers , and central banks can not hope to manage risk if they do not understand that the drivers of risk taking lurk deep in our bodies			0
’ ‘ risk managers who fail to understand this will have as little success as fire fighters spraying water at the tips of flames			0
