elderly residents at a sheltered housing block have been banned from drinking alcohol in communal areas following complaints by tenants about rowdy and ' intimidating ' behaviour			1
residents in their 80s and 90s were said to be so frightened by the actions of two tenants that staff called in 24 - hour security to keep the peace over @entity15			1
now the guards have gone but residents can no longer drink in shared areas following a row that began in the communal room as some of the pensioners put up their christmas tree in early december			1
alchohol is banned from communal areas at @entity26 sheltered housing in @entity28 , @entity29 a spokesman for @entity31 , which runs the housing complex , said the complaints centered on two residents at the @entity26 sheltered housing complex in @entity28 , @entity29			1
he said : ' the consumption of alcohol is still banned in communal areas at @entity26			2
' but he said that the security guard who was brought in last december to deter anyone at the accommodation from misbehaving had been stood down earlier this month			1
one carer who helps a pensioner at the block said residents blamed a couple of ' problem tenants ' whose antisocial behaviour was upsetting the peaceful majority of retirees			1
an insider at the accommodation block , who did not want to be named , said : ' it is appalling to need a security guard for people in their 80s and 90s , just to protect them from other residents			1
' and the cost must have been enormous			0
to have someone there 24 hours a day , it must be thousands of pounds			2
' it was the only sheltered housing block in the borough with this measure in place			0
' @entity31 , which runs @entity26 , above , says they are looking into the residents ' complaints the 33 - flat block caters for over- 60s in independent flats , with a communal sitting room and kitchen			1
another source said : ' they brought in the security guard 24 hours a day at first			1
then he was scaled down to be there between 4pm and midnight in case anything happened , and now he has gone			0
' but people are still fearful			0
no one wants to use the communal areas because they are scared they will be subjected to abuse and intimidation			0
' there are no group activities			0
with these dark winter nights , everyone is in by 5pm , but then it 's lockdown			0
everyone just goes to their own rooms all night			0
' some people are in their 80s and 90s and are not strong enough to stand up for themselves			0
' and there were no @entity100 parties for @entity26 because booze has been banned in communal areas			2
' residents could n't have a drink to celebrate the festive season			0
' people in other sheltered blocks were up until 1am celebrating , but at @entity26 they were all in bed by 9.30pm			2
' a number of @entity26 residents complained to @entity31 , which manages the block			1
@entity112 , director of housing for @entity113 , said : ' we do not tolerate antisocial behaviour in any form and always encourage our tenants to report any cases of abusive , threatening or intimidating behaviour to us so that we can take appropriate action			2
' we are investigating allegations of antisocial behaviour at @entity122 in @entity28 following a number of complaints from tenants			2
' we are working closely with tenants and their families and have agreed to put a number of temporary measures in place to provide reassurance while we resolve this matter			0
