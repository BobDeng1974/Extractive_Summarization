' however the lawyer admitted that @entity0 took fingers from the victims			1
he noted that while it 's inappropriate to take such trophies , soldiers are taught to ' disassociate war casualties from the human being they once were '			2
in some of the most gruesome allegations to emerge from the @entity15 war , prosecutors say @entity0 and his co-defendants slaughtered the victims with grenades and powerful machine guns during patrols in @entity35 province , then dropped weapons near their bodies to make them appear to have been combatants			1

others in the unit , including some of his co-defendants , portrayed him as an imposing sociopath with little respect for life – a man who gunned down dogs without provocation , threatened fellow soldiers and who tallied his kills with skull tattoos on his calves			0
a prosecutor , captain @entity93 , told the jurors at @entity95 , south of @entity96 that @entity0 took advantage of weak leadership in the platoon to lead his juniors into the diabolical plot			1
this would n't be a case where they have to second - guess difficult combat decisions , captain @entity93 told them			0
turning on each other : @entity9 special @entity76 at @entity95 in @entity110 where he is a potential witness in staff sgt. @entity0 ' murder trial justice : the military courtroom where the court - martial of @entity9 staff sgt. @entity0 is being held 2011 at @entity95 he said : ' this case is the exact opposite : it is about premeditated murder			1
' the crimes are among the most gruesome allegations to emerge from the @entity15 war			0

he soon began telling others how easy it would be to kill civilians , @entity93 said			0
when the platoon later came across a body that had been mangled by a helicopter gun , the prosecution said , @entity0 had reason to believe he 'd really be able to get away with murder			1
as the platoon 's leadership watched , one soldier stabbed the corpse with a knife and posed for a photo			0
deal : corporal @entity76 has pleaded guilty and was given a 24 - year sentence captain @entity93 added : ' this platoon is out of control			1

when @entity0 came to the unit , hash smoking was already rampant , @entity36 said			1
@entity0 , who had more combat experience than most of the others , did talk frequently of previous shootings he 'd been involved in – including one in @entity161 , when @entity0 fired on a car that refused to stop at a checkpoint , only to later learn that the vehicle was carrying an innocent @entity161 family			1
the others may have misinterpreted @entity0 ' stories , according to mr @entity36			1
he said : ' on hash - filled nights , under a cloud of intoxication ... they 'd talk about these things			0
' @entity0 is accused of a wide range of misconduct , from providing a grenade used in january 2010 to kill the first victim , an unarmed farmer in a field in @entity35 province , to directly shooting or tossing grenades at the next two in february and may of that year			1
one co-defendant , then - cpl. @entity76 of @entity181 , @entity182 , said that he or @entity183 enlisted one other soldier to participate in each of the three killings			0

@entity188 said they wanted action and firefights but instead got meetings			0
he added : ' it was a lot of meet - and - greets , shaking hands			0
' prosecutors said @entity0 also led a group of others in assaulting a soldier who reported drug use in the unit , and that he threatened that same soldier with fingers severed from the bodies of dead @entity15			2
@entity208 , ultimately prompted the war crimes investigation by telling investigators who were looking into his beating that members of his platoon had engaged in unjustified kills			0
@entity36 admitted that @entity0 took part in the beating to punish @entity217 for going outside the chain of command to report the drug use			1
he said : ' did he get roughed up ? yeah			0
was he brutalized ? no. ' @entity0 and @entity188 also paid @entity217 a visit later to make sure he did n't report the beating , @entity36 said			2
@entity0 rolled out the severed fingers on a cloth , and @entity188 told @entity217 not to wind up like those guys			2

@entity239 had previously tried to blow the whistle on the plot by reporting it to his family , who reported the allegations to @entity95 after the first killing			0
the report went unheeded , and two more civilians were killed before the defendants were arrested in may last year			0
@entity239 said he participated in the last killing because he believed @entity0 might kill him if he did n't			2
' he likes to kill things , ' @entity239 told investigators			0
