for a player that has yet to regularly score at club level , @entity0 certainly needs no invitation to where the back of the net is while wearing a @entity9 shirt			1
the former @entity11 striker became an outcast at the @entity13 and is now struggling for game time at @entity15			1
but a hat - trick against the @entity17 on wednesday shows the striker has no problems at international level			1
here @entity21 looks at the @entity23 's international scoring record as well as nine other hot - shots who have failed to replicate the form shown for their country at their clubs			1
@entity30 ( @entity31 caps 149 , goals 109 ) @entity30 is in a league of his own			0
as the top international goal scorer of all time he is the only player to net over 100 times for his country			2
@entity30 celebrates scoring for @entity39 against @entity40 during his short stay with the @entity43 giants @entity30 was prolific for @entity44 and featured in the @entity45 where he played against the @entity17 ( above ) but the striker found banging goals in for @entity44 was a lot easier than doing it on a weekly basis in @entity51			1
@entity39 signed him in 1998 but within a year he was at @entity52 , who offloaded him to @entity54 in 2002 following just six league goals			0
@entity56 ( @entity57 & @entity58 caps 115 , goals 70 ) with an international strike rate better than @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , you would hope a player as prolific as that on the global scene to at least make a splash in the @entity69			0
@entity70 's @entity56 ( right ) goes down under pressure from @entity73 's @entity72 in 2002 @entity75 's @entity74 clears the ball off the line in front of @entity56 and @entity79 during the @entity81 ' 2 - 0 win over @entity57 at the group stages of the 2006 @entity45 but @entity56 never stood out during his two years at @entity70 between 2002 and 2004 , while @entity83 also opted against giving him much of a chance in the top flight			1
it certainly does n't reflect well on the international opponents @entity57 must have been playing			0
@entity88 ( @entity31 caps 122 , goals 48 ) since making his international debut over 11 years ago , @entity88 has gone on to become a regular for @entity51 , winning over 120 caps and of course the @entity45 last year			0
@entity11 's @entity88 ( right ) fends off @entity39 's @entity94 during a @entity96 game @entity88 has over 120 caps for @entity51 and took a selfie with @entity99 after winning the @entity100 in @entity101 last summer following a 1 - 0 victory over @entity103 in the final his international breakthrough came while starring for @entity106 but since moving to @entity39 in 2006 , his club form never again hit the same consistent heights			1
a flop at @entity39 and frozen out at @entity11 , he is now toiling on loan at @entity111 from the @entity13			2
@entity112 ( @entity113 caps 93 , goals 41 ) between 2002 and 2008 , @entity112 failed to establish himself as a @entity69 striker following an average spell at @entity117 , a poor two years at @entity118 and a very brief loan spell at @entity120			0
@entity122 's @entity121 slides in on @entity117 's @entity112 during a @entity69 game in 2005 as @entity122 's @entity124 looks on @entity112 was the top scorer at @entity125 as he celebrates one of his five goals against @entity128 @entity129 reached the semi-finals thanks to @entity112 ' two goals in a 3 - 0 quarter - final win over @entity9 so it was intriguing to see that during this period he was also the top scorer at @entity125 , scoring five goals as @entity129 reached the semi-finals			1
@entity137 ( @entity138 caps 95 , goals 36 ) now @entity137 was n't a bad player , but for a striker that holds the record for the most goals in a @entity146 qualifying campaign ( 13 for @entity147 ) , you would have expected him to make more of his opportunity in the @entity69			0
@entity149 can only look on as @entity137 fires home the winning goal for @entity151 in a famous 1 - 0 victory over @entity75 in a @entity45 qualifier back in 2005 at @entity154 @entity137 celebrates scoring for @entity155 against @entity156 in 2007 before seeing the goal ruled out but just five league goals for @entity155 and @entity83 between 2007 and 2011 indicated otherwise			0
still , @entity151 fans will cherish the memory of his famous winner against @entity75 in 2005			0
@entity0 ( @entity163 caps 65 , goals 29 ) much maligned during his @entity11 spell , and even loan spell at @entity83 and @entity167 failed to land him permanent moves			1
@entity11 's @entity0 ( right ) and @entity170 's @entity169 compete for the ball during a fourth round @entity174 match in 2013 at the @entity175 @entity0 has a fine scoring record for @entity9 , here he celebrates a @entity178 goal against @entity179 even now at @entity15 , @entity0 can hardly get a kick			1
for @entity9 though he is a totally different prospect			2
his hat - trick against @entity17 on wednesday reflects well on a record which has seen him score five goals more than he did in the league at @entity11 in 43 fewer games			1
@entity187 ( @entity179 - @entity31 caps 71 , goals 27 ) it seems incredible to think that a striker who could n't even get into one of @entity193 's worst ever @entity69 teams during the 2003 - 04 season is still mixing it with the likes of @entity197 at the highest level			1
. @entity187 scored his only league goal for @entity193 against @entity117 in january 2004 but @entity187 would later haunt @entity75 after equalising against the @entity81 in a @entity125 quarter - final @entity187 scored just one league goal at @entity193 , but he had the last laugh on @entity75			2
@entity187 scored for @entity179 against the @entity81 in @entity125 , while also featuring in the team that dumped out @entity206 's side at the @entity45 two years later			2
@entity207 ( @entity208 caps 79 , goals 27 ) it was no surprise earlier in his career that not just @entity212 but @entity83 decided to bring the powerful looking forward to the @entity69			0
@entity207 fends off @entity170 's @entity213 in a 2014 @entity174 quarter - final @entity207 ( second right ) celebrates scoring against @entity9 in an international friendly on wednesday but just one league goal in 42 appearances for the @entity219 though soon had the @entity221 outfit packing him off to @entity223 in a swap deal for @entity225			1
despite this , @entity207 still holds his own in the starting xi of a respectable @entity17 outfit			2
@entity230 ( @entity231 caps 69 , goals 21 ) the star man of @entity235 's 2002 @entity45 campaign which helped him land @entity236 for the second year running after the tournament			0
@entity230 is sent off for @entity117 in a @entity69 match at @entity170 as @entity74 looks on in 2004 @entity230 celebrates after @entity235 beat @entity239 to progress to the 2002 @entity45 quarter - finals so it was seen as quite a coup for @entity117 when they signed the forward for Â£ 10m			0
just three league goals in three years though saw his stock dramatically fall and despite holding down a place after joining @entity73 , he never hit the same global stardom which earned him his high profile @entity250 move			0
@entity252 ( @entity253 caps 32 , goals 12 ) frustrated at a lack of playing time in his six years at @entity122 , @entity252 is finding a similar problem now at @entity11 in that he can not get a start as a striker in front of @entity260			2
@entity252 struck for @entity11 recently in their 2 - 1 win at @entity122 in the @entity262 @entity252 's clever back - heel goal helped @entity75 beat @entity239 3 - 2 during the group stages at @entity178 @entity252 has impressed when playing as a striker for @entity75			1
here he celebrates a goal against @entity267 stick the 24 - year - old in an @entity75 shirt though and he comes to life			0
his cheeky back heel against @entity239 at @entity178 underlined his ability , and his recent addition to the side in partnering @entity275 seems to have also improved the form of the @entity75 captain .			0

@entity0 scored a hat - trick for @entity9 in 3 - 2 win over @entity17
