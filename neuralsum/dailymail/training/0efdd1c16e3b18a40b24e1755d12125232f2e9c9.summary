by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 07:45 est , 17 july 2013 scientists believe we could be closer to developing a drug that gives us the benefits of exercising without moving a muscle			1
a studies has shown that a compound affected levels of a protein called @entity11 in muscles - which has been shown to boost metabolism , normalise cholesterol levels and affect how much we sleep			1
experts hope that the compound could one day help disabled people get the benefits of exercise without having to move			1
a study has found that a new compound affected levels of a protein called @entity11 , which has been shown to boost metabolism , normalise cholesterol levels and affect how much we sleep the study , published this week by researchers at the @entity30 in @entity31 , found that when their compound was injected into obese mice , it helped them lose weight - even if they were on a high - fat diet - and improved their cholesterol levels , according to a @entity41 report			1
the treated mice also began using more oxygen throughout the day and expending about 5 per cent more energy than untreated mice , even though they were not moving about more than the other animals			0
this in effect means the compound boosted their metabolism			2
@entity30 scientists also worked with researchers at the @entity55 in @entity56 and other institutions , to discover what their compound might be doing inside muscles to provide this ' invisible ' exercise			1
experts have discovered that a compound they formulated affected proteins in the muscles which in turn mimicked an intensive workout they knew that their drug increased the potency of the @entity11 protein , but no one knew what it actually did to muscles			1
they therefore developed a strain of mice that could not express very much of the protein in their muscle cells			2
these animals were what they described as ' anti-athletes '			0
one of the hallmarks of regular aerobic exercise is that it increases the number and activity of the mitochondria , the cellular structures that help to generate energy while consuming oxygen , in the muscles			0
but these animalsâ € ™ muscles contained very few mitochondria			0
as a result , the animals had diminished endurance , with a maximam oxygen capacity about 60 percent lower than normal			0
they reached exhaustion on treadmill testing long before their unaffected labmates			0
but when , in a separate part of the experiment , scientists added their compound to isolated muscle cells from the deficient mice , the cells began pumping out far more @entity111			2
those cells , subsequently , began creating large numbers of new mitochondria and strengthening the existing ones			0
the drug act as an exercise mimic , explained co-author @entity118 , now the chairman of the department of pharmacological and physiological science at @entity121			0
it is not inconceivable , he added , that at some point in the future , such a drug might allow people , especially those who are disabled or canâ € ™ t otherwise exercise , to enjoy the health benefits of endurance without the exertion .			1

scientists discovered that when a compound they created was injected in mice , it boosted metabolism , endurance and improved cholesterol levels
compound affected levels of a protein called @entity11 in the muscles
hoped that one day a pill could be developed that gives benefits of exercise to disabled people who are not *mobile*
