a @entity1 neuroscientist who revolutionised our understanding of how the brain works has been awarded the @entity5			1
professor @entity6 , who discovered the brain ’s ‘ inner gps system ’ , has been instrumental in unveiling the way in which @entity11 ’s disease destroys the lives of millions			1
he has been researching the brain for 50 years and yesterday warned that ageing populations all over the world are creating a health ‘ time bomb ’			1
professor @entity6 said yesterday he was ‘ still in shock ’ at being awarded the prize , adding : ‘ it is the highest accolade you can get			2
it is a terrific sign of the way the world thinks about the works we have been doing and how the world thinks about @entity1 neuroscience			1
’ who are they ? @entity20 , 75 , an @entity51 - @entity1 professor of cognitive neuroscience at @entity19 ; may - @entity53 , 51 , and @entity24 , 52 , a married team of neuroscientists at the @entity25 in @entity26			1
for what ? for their discoveries of how rats determine where they are and how to move through the world			0
that lead to a deeper understanding of how the brain , including ours , creates a map of the environment - essentially an inner global positioning system , or gps			1
what 's the significance ? professor @entity20 's discoveries had ' a dramatic impact on the study of how the brain creates behavior , ' the @entity73 committee said			1
thirty years later , the @entity79 ' research in the same field found how activities in so - called grid cells allowed the brain to divide the environment into longitude and latitude , which helps the brain know how far it is from any given starting point			1
together the three scientists were cited for having helped bring about a ' paradigm shift in our understanding of how groups of specialized nerve cells work together to execute higher brain functions			1
' some say this understanding could eventually revolutionise the treatment of diseases such as @entity11 's			0
professor @entity6 , 75 , was born in @entity99 but came to @entity19 as a researcher in 1967			2
he became a joint @entity51 - @entity1 citizen after he made the first key discovery in understanding the brain ’s navigation system in 1971			1
he discovered the brain has ‘ place cells ’ which are specifically for storing memories and together form a kind of map			1
some 34 years later professor @entity6 and @entity111 couple @entity110 and @entity24 made a further breakthrough in finding a cell that generates a co-ordinate system for path - finding			1
crucially , the scientists found how @entity11 ’s works at a cellular level by blocking off this ‘ internal gps ’ system , which explains why dementia patients often seem disorientated			2
professor @entity6 said the work provided a basis for great strides in @entity11 ’s research			2
‘ if you do know how the brain works then we have the chance to look at disease , ’ he said			0
‘ we all know there is a time bomb there			0
i ca n’t say when we will have a cure , but we now know through our findings how to ask the question of what is going wrong at the earliest stage of @entity11 ’s			0
’ the @entity138 awarded the £ 690,000 prize jointly to professor @entity6 and the @entity79			0
it said their findings represent a ‘ paradigm shift ’ in our knowledge of the brain , adding : ‘ it has opened new avenues for understanding other cognitive processes , such as memory , thinking and planning			0
’ professor @entity6 , who was recently presented a separate award by @entity51 president @entity151 , said : ‘ i do what i do merrily out of curiosity , because i want to know how the brain works			1
that will get me up early in the morning and keep me going all day long			0
’ an excited @entity155 , 51 , said : ' this is crazy ! ' after learning they had won			2
she said her 52 - year - old husband did n't immediately find out about the prize because he was flying monday morning to the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 , to demonstrate their research			0
@entity51 - born professor @entity20 , of @entity19 , identified the first component , when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room ' this is such a great honor for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us , ' she said , adding they had been together for 30 years			1
' we are going to continue and hopefully do even more groundbreaking work in the future			0
' @entity178 , a spokeswoman at the university in @entity26 , said @entity155 was at the university when she found out she had won			2
' she needed a minute to cry and speak with her team , ' @entity178 said			0
' her husband was on a plane so he does n't know yet			0
' the @entity138 said that knowledge about the brain 's positioning system may ' help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss ' , that affects people with @entity11 's disease			1
may - @entity53 is pictured on the phone at a celebration party in the @entity25 following the announcement @entity24 did n't immediately find out about the prize because he was flying monday morning to the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 , to demonstrate their research the discoveries have also opened new avenues for understanding cognitive functions such as memory , thinking and planning , it said			2
' thanks to our grid and place cells , we do n't have to walk around with a map to find our way each time we visit a city because we have that map in our head , ' said @entity213 , chair of the medicine prize committee			1
' i think , without these cells , we would have a really hard time to survive			0
' colleagues and scientists were quick to praise the trio 's ' revolutionary ' work			0
professor @entity222 , president - elect of the @entity223 said professor @entity20 , who helped found the association , was highly deserving of the accolade			1
dr @entity226 , director of the @entity227 added : ' he is a world leader who has inspired a generation of neuroscientists , and whose work as founding director of the @entity232 will further enhance our knowledge of neural circuits and how we behave			2
' i know from our many hours of discussions about this hugely exciting project that he is an individual of great humanity , integrity and personal generosity			0
' he is also a truly exceptional scientist and it is an honour for me to have worked closely with him over the last year			0
' on behalf of myself and the @entity227 i am delighted to offer our very warmest congratulations to @entity6			0
' the professor , who is married with two sons , is considering putting his half of the prize money towards a scientific trust .			0

@entity1 scientist @entity20 and @entity111 couple @entity155 and @entity24 share the accolade
they were honoured for their work discovering the ' inner gps ' that helps the brain navigate through the world
in 1971 @entity51 - born professor @entity20 identified nerve cells , known as ' place cells ' that activated when a rate was at a certain place in a room
34 years on the @entity266 discovered ' grid cells ' that generate a coordinate system for *precise* positioning and path - finding
