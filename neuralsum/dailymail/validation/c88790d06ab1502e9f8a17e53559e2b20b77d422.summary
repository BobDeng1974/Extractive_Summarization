in @entity2 working yourself to death is so common they even have a name for it - karoshi			1
now the government is trying to cut the number of people who drop dead at their desks by making holidays compulsory			0
laws currently being debated in the @entity2 parliament will make it illegal not to take at least five days of holiday a year			1
a survey by the country 's labour ministry in 2013 found employees only took nine out of their allotted 18.5 days of holiday			1
another poll , according to the @entity20 , found one in six workers took no paid holiday at all			1
these so called ' salarymen ' or office ladies fear resentment from their colleagues if they take days off , a real concern in a conformist culture that values harmony			1
a video showing the brutal reality of a @entity46 ' salaryman ' doing 80 hour working week recently went viral on @entity47 , scoring 738,630 views			0
@entity2 workers pack the subway - 22 per cent of @entity2 work more than 49 hours a week in it a 24 - year - old man named @entity54 , who works for a financial company , films himself rushing to squeeze in time to eat , shower and sleep , in between clocking up 78 hours at work in six days			1
he said : ' there are definitely people in @entity46 who do this all year round in order to support their families			1
i could n't imagine having to do this if i had those kinds of responsibilities as well			0
' compared to my experiences in the @entity72 , the management style here seems to focus slightly more on hours actually spent in the office , as opposed to actual work output			2
' as a result you begin to create a level of inefficiency whereby employees will know how much work they need to do in a day , and spread this out over say 12 hours , instead of getting the work done in 8 and going home			2
' college - educated @entity84 , 36 , who works for a major trading company , used just eight of her 20 paid vacation days last year			2
six of those days were for being sick			0
she told the @entity90 : ' nobody else uses their vacation days '			0
but this strict work ethic is coming at a terrible cost , with record numbers of @entity2 workers suffering stress - related illness , premature death and suicide			1
if the law is passed more @entity2 will be taking holidays in popular destinations like @entity104 according to official data , about 200 people die every year from heart attacks , strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules			1
@entity2 must use their vacations for sick days , although a separate law guarantees two - thirds of their wages if they get seriously ill and take extended days off			1
that means workers save two or three vacation days for fear of catching a cold or some other minor illness so they can stay home , said @entity121 , the @entity122 and @entity124 official overseeing such standards			2
wakebe himself routinely does 100 hours of overtime a month , and took only five days off last year , one of them for staying home with a cold , but he managed to get away to @entity104 with his family			2
@entity54 , who works for a financial company , films himself rushing to squeeze in time to eat , shower and sleep , in between clocking up 78 hours at work in six days ' it is actually a worker 's right to take paid vacations , ' he said			1
' but working in @entity2 involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit			2
' the prime minister , @entity143 , is not known for taking long vacations			0
yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees			0
@entity2 's working culture , @entity143 said recently , ' falsely beatifies long hours '			1
by the end of the decade , the government hopes it will push @entity2 employees towards following the example set by @entity72 workers , who use an average of 20 days ' paid annual leave in a speech to the @entity159 in @entity160 last year he said : ' we must reform the work style that places importance on the amount of time spent working , an orientation created by men			1
we will press forward in reviewing the system of labor that gives consideration to the work - life balance			0
' @entity2 's working culture , ' falsely beatifies long hours ' according to pm @entity143 the new law will allow for more flexible work hours , encouraging parents to spend more time with their children during summer months , for instance , when school is closed			1
by the end of the decade , the government hopes it will push @entity2 employees towards following the example set by @entity72 workers , who use an average of 20 days ' paid annual leave , and those in @entity35 , who take an average of 25			1
@entity185 , a @entity72 psychologist and professor of organisational psychology and health at @entity189 said the law was a ' really good idea			0
' he added : ' we do n't have a word for death by overwork			0
the fact the @entity2 do - karoshi - show how much of a problem it is			2
' the @entity2 work culture is really messed up			1
they work long hours and have really long commutes			0
they have been a nation of workaholics since @entity207			0
they were proud of it , but it has a human cost			0
' their healthy diet with a lot of fish oil means they should not have heart problems , but record numbers are dying from heart disease caused by stress			0
they are also suffering depression and anxiety caused by overwork			0
the suicide rates are also significantly high			0
' the @entity2 government now sees the cost in human health and life and have decided to tackle it			2
the common view is working a lot and not taking holidays is macho but the government is saying we do n't think that is ok and there are consequences			0
' i think if the law is past people will obey it because the @entity2 tend to be sticklers for rules			1
' even if it is not passed , it is important people are talking about it			0

law being debated by @entity2 parliament to *ban* taking less than five days holiday a year
survey by @entity2 's labour ministry in 2013 found employees only took nine out of their allotted 18.5 days of holiday
' @entity258 ' or office ladies fear being *ostracised* by colleagues
around 200 people die every year from heart attacks , strokes brought on by punishing work schedules
