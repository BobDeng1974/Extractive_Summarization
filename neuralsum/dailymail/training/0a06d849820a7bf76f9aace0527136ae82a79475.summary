tv presenter @entity0 sparked outrage today after an on - air outburst where he dismissed a report claiming one in two children had bullied - and called his co-host a ' wimp '			1
@entity8 host @entity0 , 52 , condemned an @entity10 report which claimed that almost one half of all pupils suffered some degree of bullying at school			1
reviewing the day ’s national newspapers on the @entity8 show at 7am , father - of - four @entity0 slammed the findings as ' unbelievable '			1
bullying discussion : @entity0 and co-presenter @entity20 fall out over the bullying statistics that show half of children have suffered he went on to call school bullying ' just life ' and ' growing up ' and mocked it as just ' someone sticking their tongue out '			1
horrified co-presenter @entity20 , 37 , was clearly stunned by his remarks and told him : ' if someone feels bullied that means they are being bullied , surely ? '			1
but @entity0 , who previously presented @entity35 for 13 years , then turned on @entity36 and replied : ' that ’s why the world is in the state that it is , people like you just being wimpy about everything '			1
today furious anti-bullying campaigners and @entity45 users slammed @entity0 as a ' bully ' himself			1
@entity47 , of the @entity48 , based at the @entity49 , said : ' bullying is a serious issue that can have a devastating effect on the lives of children and young people			2
' children and young people who experience bullying need to know they can speak out , that they will be heard , and that they will be taken seriously			2
' @entity56 , director of @entity57 , said : ' it is so unfortunate that we should still be hearing comments such as , ‘ bullying is part of growing up ’			2
' to say to children and young people that it is somehow ok for them to be subjected to bullying is totally unacceptable			2
' we must remember that there are long - term effects for the targets , and indeed for the bullies			1
' if we feed young people the myth overtly , or by messages of acceptance , that bullying is " normal behaviour " then we are failing them			2
defiant : @entity0 later took to @entity45 to back his points about bullying and argue with a parent who claimed his child had been a target of bullies ' it is possible to create environments in which bullying is defined appropriately and not tolerated , and in which aggression and violence are viewed as wholly inappropriate types of behaviour			1
' we work with a large number of bullied children and their families each year , and it has to be said that they will feel very distressed that their suffering and despair has been dismissed so glibly			2
' @entity0 , married to @entity90 , was commenting on the front page of the ‘ i ’ newspaper , which carried the shock @entity10 figures			1
the report , ‘ no place for bullying ’ stated that almost half of pupils surveyed at primary and secondary school felt picked on or bullied at some point			1
incidents related to friendships , appearance , their family situation , sexuality , race , religion , ability , being seen as clever , disability or a combination of factors			2
one secondary school pupil told the questionnaire she had been bullied ' basically for being me '			2
@entity0 said : ' the i leads on figures from an @entity10 report : almost half of children are bullied at school , now that i find just unbelievable			1
one out of two children			2
' what do they constitute as bullying ? someone sticking their tongue out at them ? there ’s bullying , let ’s take that very seriously but to say that one out of two children is put upon at school			0
' maybe that ’s just life , maybe that ’s what it ’s called			0
' co-presenter @entity20 replied : ' if someone feels bullied that means they are being bullied , surely ? strong views : @entity20 disagreed with her co-presenter , saying if a child felt bullied it was a case of bullying ' if half the children feel they are being bullied whatever form that takes because for some people it might have to be quite severe for it to have an impact but for other people even taunts can make them feel like they are being bullied and that should count in my opinion			1
' @entity0 retorted : ' do n’t bully me			0
see , that ’s why the world is in the state that it is , people like you just being wimpy about everything			1
' @entity36 said : ' you ca n’t blame me for bullying you one minute and then call me wimpy the next			1
' @entity0 summed up the piece by stating : ' one in two children are bullied at school			0
do n’t believe it , it ’s called growing up basically			0
' @entity0 was condemned as ' uninformed and crass ' by campaigners and bullying victims			0
on @entity45 , @entity175 said : ' did @ eamonnholmes just bully his coworker ? and now , just says he dispelled the research ? errr that ’s your opinion @ @entity181 '			0
@entity0 wrote back : ' @ @entity182 and your opinion is that every second child is being bullied ? get a grip man , u r doing the fight against real buulying no favs ( sic ) ' another user , @entity190 tweeted : ' @ @entity191 scathing public attitudes like yours can stop children who really are being bullied from coming forward			0
' @entity195 : the pair clashed during a paper review on @entity8 this morning @entity198 wrote to @entity20 on the micro blogging site : ' @ @entity200 have asked @entity0 to meet with my daughter , so she can tell him all about being bullied , strangly he has now gone very quite ( sic ) ! ' later , mr @entity198 , 38 , from @entity203 said his daughter was bullied so badly between the ages of nine and 12 that she was forced to move schools twice			1
he said : ' i am very sad that a well - known personality such as mr @entity0 would say such a thing , his comments were uninformed and crass			0
' i asked him to meet with my daughter so she could explain her thoughts on the subject			0
' he refused , referred to me as a " deep thinker " and told me i could start a fight in an empty room			1
' really @entity8 and its viewers deserve better			0
' mother @entity216 , 47 , was forced to move her daughter @entity217 , eight , out of her school after she was tormented by school bullies			1
@entity216 , an assistant to @entity221 mp @entity220 , said she was ' disgusted ' by @entity0 ’ comments about bullying			0
she said : ' it is awful , i ca n’t believe someone has actually said that			0
you would have thought he would have known better			0
' for me , teasing is a fact of life but there is a whole difference between teasing and bullying and to say that is completely out of order			0
' my view is that we will never stop bullying initially - it ’s how you go about handling it that ’s important			0
' tonight @entity0 said : ' i would n't ever condone bullying , i just questioned the stats - and i ask everyone else to do the same			0
' as an interviewer my job is to question and challenge - it is important we differentiate between what is true damaging bullying and what is a bit of playground life , otherwise the smaller stuff stops the serious stuff being dealt with			0
' @entity254 viewers know @entity36 and i take opposing views on a subject most days - the idea is to stimulate debate which it clearly did			0

refused to believe @entity10 report that *suggests* half of *schoolchildren* have suffered at the hands of bullies
argued with co-host @entity20 describing her attitude as ' wimpy '
