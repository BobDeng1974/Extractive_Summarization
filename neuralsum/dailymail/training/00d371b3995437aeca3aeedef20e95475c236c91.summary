in the first of a new weekly column , chief sports writer @entity0 gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week , saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver ... hot @entity7 @entity7 are currently gaining 0.5 points more each week than any rival in the @entity10 , meaning they are on course to be crowned champions before the end of april			1
last season , they had it won by march			2
are they slipping ? not if you saw events at the @entity19 on tuesday			2
@entity20 looked good against @entity21 did n’t they ? @entity22 played like the best @entity23 left back , still			1
@entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ? @entity22 was in a different class			2
but did you see the poor old soul by the time @entity30 had finished with him on tuesday ? he looked like he ’d just been told @entity33 wanted him back			2
and this is a @entity44 team that lost @entity46 , their midfield heartbeat , to @entity49 in the summer , remember			2
later , they were granted an audience with @entity52 at the @entity53 : as if @entity54 needs help from on high			2
the @entity56 you see it in real time and you ’re not sure			2
you watch the action replay and , well , now i ’m confused			2
was that what i thought it was ? did he ? and after the second replay – he did , you know			2
@entity36 scored for @entity69 against @entity70 from just outside the penalty area : with a 36 mph rabona			1
what ’s a rabona ? it ’s a shot or cross in which the kicking leg is wrapped behind the standing leg : effectively a crossed leg kick			2
@entity36 scores his amazing ' rabona ' goal for @entity69 on thursday night @entity56 is a @entity81 word meaning to skip school , and is named after @entity82 , a striker for @entity83 and @entity84 , who scored from 35 yards using this method against @entity86 in 1948			1
the following week the football magazine @entity87 produced a front cover playing on @entity82 ’s surname ( which translates as ‘ child ’ ) with the playing dressed as a schoolboy and the headline @entity93 ( the child plays hooky )			0
@entity97 , the @entity69 coach , later lavished praise on @entity36 but appeared distinctly stone - faced at the time : probably because he knew the nightmare that awaited him at the next training ground shooting drill			1
@entity102 during the match between @entity105 and @entity49 an email dropped in @entity106 ’s in - tray from two people with a very keen sense of priorities			1
eschewing any desire to see @entity111 score one of the greatest goals in the history of @entity116 nights at @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 ( not their real name ) wanted to know why the @entity121 continued to give more column inches to @entity123 , at the expense of their beloved @entity125			1
@entity102 on the touchline during the 1 - 0 victory at @entity129 which sent @entity125 top of the championship they were particularly unhappy that on the night @entity125 went top of the league their team was allocated space equivalent to the round - up from @entity139 dogs			1
usually , what ’s @entity106 has a standard response to complaints of this nature – he sends the boys round – but on this occasion , they had a point			0
@entity125 are top of the @entity131 and @entity102 , their coach , is doing an outstanding job			1
as mention of @entity102 ’s name is usually the cue for fans to pick up flaming torches and attack the owner ’s @entity154 , @entity125 deserve credit for giving @entity102 the break he deserved			1
it might not have felt that way at the time , but not making it through the play - off final was quite the stroke of luck			0
it has given a young team time to grow			0
@entity166 might be regretting that late @entity168 goal too , considering recent events			1
which brings us to ... what ’s not @entity174 ’s @entity173 after @entity175 questioned his fitness , noted @entity166 reserve @entity174 conducted a round of interviews displaying his fine physique			1
@entity175 gave the impression @entity174 looked like this : this is how @entity175 said @entity174 looked while @entity174 thought he looked more like this : @entity174 seemed to think he looked more like the @entity184 the reality , as you can see , is that he looks like this			1
this is the reality of how @entity166 forward @entity174 looks , pictured by @entity190 while a properly ripped footballer looks like this			1
this is a properly ripped footballer ( and not a bad one , too ) @entity111 all of which makes @entity174 and @entity166 seem a bit like this			1
it 's all left @entity166 and @entity174 looking a bit @entity198 ( next week : puppets ) @entity200 the tiny violins were out this week for the departure of @entity204 general secretary , @entity200 , a man whose title says all you need to know about his dynamism			1
@entity200 used to be the chief executive			1
but then it was considered having a general secretary might curry favour with @entity212 and @entity213 because they also had one			0
so @entity200 became that instead			1
apart from a key role in moving the @entity217 final to a kick - off time that makes the match inaccessible to anybody residing north of @entity221 , establishing @entity223 ’s training ground and overseeing a national football stadium so popular it may need bailing out by the @entity225 , @entity200 will mainly be remembered as the man who said @entity227 had done enough to keep his job as @entity230 manager just by getting to the @entity231			1
this statement made turning up something of an irrelevance , a fact later confirmed by results			0
@entity200 was not a high - profile figure and to those still unsure of his identity , here is a memory jogger : at press conferences , he was the one who sat on the far right of the group of four and never got asked a question			1
not hot , never hot - rape now do n’t get what ’s not wrong , if you are currently engaged in a game of ‘ @entity250 stormtrooper and the lonely @entity252 peasant girl ’ with your partner , he ’s not judging			0
seriously , he means that			0
as long as everyone ’s into it , what ’s not admires the effort in sourcing the costumery alone			0
but if you are one of the brigade at @entity263 currently chanting @entity265 ' name as if he is some kind of returning hero , you may need to take a long look at yourself			0
@entity265 with his girlfriend @entity270 in his video statement this week perhaps at the people around you , too			0
their faces , their voices , their personalities			0
try to achieve a basic human empathy			0
because , even if you believe @entity265 is innocent , the best that can be said is he treated another human being with such crass contempt and mercilessness that it bordered on criminal			0
so either it ’s rape or it ’s the most horrid cruelty			0
yet still no apology , even for that			0
so he ’s no hero , no victim and no role model			0
and there really are better songs to sing			0
join in on the chorus of this , if you like			0
see you next week .			0

@entity7 *walloped* @entity20 in the @entity295
@entity36 really did score with a rabona from just outside the area
@entity102 has led @entity125 to the top of the championship
@entity174 *fat* spat has left him and @entity166 looking @entity198
departing @entity204 chief executive @entity200 will not be missed
