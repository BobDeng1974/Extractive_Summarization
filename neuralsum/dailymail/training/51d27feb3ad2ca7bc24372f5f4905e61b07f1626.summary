the extraordinary development has seen a ‘ @entity14 ’ label of meat established which is already being championed by some of the best restaurants in @entity13			1
it follows an experiment in @entity17 , in the southern @entity19 region of @entity2 , which saw three cows fed local wine for four months			1
enjoy it while you can ... @entity24 fed on wine were found to be ' happy ' and ended up producing exceptionally succulent meat @entity27 : it follows an experiment in southern @entity2 which saw three cows fed local wine for four months ( file picture ) @entity32 - @entity31 , who came up with the idea , said the two @entity34 and one @entity35 were initially fed the wine in a mix of barley , hay and grapes			1
it soon became clear that they were ‘ happy cows ’ who ended up producing an exceptionally succulent meat			2
outlining how he encouraged the cows to enjoy a tipple , mr @entity31 said : ‘ for each animal , alcohol intake should be equivalent to the amount recommended by health authorities for a man – namely two or three glasses of wine a day			0
in the case of cows , this amounts to between a litre and a litre - and - a - half a day			0
’ championed in @entity13 : the experiment has led to a ' @entity14 ' label of meat after a rough mix of grapes and water , the cows were allowed wine from @entity66 , a @entity67 village near @entity68 renowned for its vineyards			1
‘ the cattle loved what was on the menu and eat it with relish , ’ said @entity70 , owner of the farm where the experiment started last year			2
referring to the @entity79 grape , mr @entity70 added : ‘ i thought that next time we may try @entity79 so as to give the meat a more musky taste			2
’ @entity83 , a @entity84 - starred chef , is among those enthusing about the ‘ luxury meat ’ saying : ‘ it has a very special texture – beautiful , marbled and tender , and which caramelizes during cooking			0
all the best @entity13 restaurants will take it			1
’ @entity94 @entity93 beef , which is made with beer , is currently considered among the best in the world , but the possibility of cows enjoying vintage wine will guarantee an even more luxurious product			0
there is a down side , however : the introduction of wine into the feed of the @entity17 cows tripled the cost of their feed , adding up to 80 pounds to the cost of a prime beef cut .			0
