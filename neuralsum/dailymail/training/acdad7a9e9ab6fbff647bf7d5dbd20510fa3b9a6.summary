rating : the @entity0 in the village of @entity2 , south of @entity3 , backs on to the @entity4 , where brilliant minds work on improving human and animal health			1
an experimental sort of place			1
experimentation is not on the menu at the @entity0			1
the @entity0 : high expectations , but a rather drab sort of experience , according to our hotel inspector nothing wrong with that , but it could be so much more inviting			1
at the 16th - century pub , you can eat cosily in the bar , or less atmospherically in the oak dinning room extension , where the lights are too bright			1
turn them off and light some candles			1
but there 's still a decent buzz			2
the staff are easy - going ; the food wholesome ; the wines fairly priced			2
a confident young man , who tells us he 's just started his own radio show , escorts us to our room			2
there are eight of them in a separate low - lying building at the back of the plot			2
ours is functional - and dull			0
we 're astonished that the website calls the accommodation ' stunning '			0
one of the windows looks on to a brick wall			0
the garden was landscaped by a @entity47 winner			1
it must have been a dreary year			0
but we like the dovecote			0
i count ten doves sitting contentedly and they do n't move an inch as we file past on our way to breakfast			0
we go for the full @entity55 , mainly because the table of cereals and fruit looks so unexciting			0
we had high expectations of our stay , not least because the website talks about its ' multi-award - winning status '			0
the @entity0 @entity2 @entity65 @entity66 01799 530601 , www.redlionhinxton.co.uk doubles from Â£ 115 , @entity68 rating :			1

the @entity0 sits in the *charming* @entity65 village of @entity2
it *boasts* a garden landscaped by a former @entity47 winner
