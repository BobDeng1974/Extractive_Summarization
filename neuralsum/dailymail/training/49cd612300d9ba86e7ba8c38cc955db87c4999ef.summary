that means its 12 bedrooms come in at $ 10 million each , but the anonymous buyer also gets two of his or her own islands in the @entity16 to sweeten the deal			2
the 13,000 - square - foot mansion called @entity19 also features a 75 - foot pool , grass tennis court and stone carriage house			1
$ 10m per bedroom : a 12 - bedroom @entity3 mansion sold friday for the record - breaking sum of $ 120 million -- apparently enough dough to buy palm trees even in chilly @entity5 @entity28 : the 50 - acre waterfront estate features a 75 - foot pool , two islands in @entity16 , a stone carriage house and a grass tennis court @entity34 : the home once belonged to @entity37 's niece and originally listed last may for an even more jaw - dropping $ 190 million while it 's original listing price was an even more astonishing $ 190 million , real estate agent @entity38 tells the @entity41 he believes the sum is the most ever paid for a residential property in the @entity8			1
' i 'll tell you a secret , ' he said after the historic closing friday			0
' this is also the most expensive property sold in @entity8			0
the next - most - expensive sold for $ 117 million in @entity49			2
' that 9 - acre @entity51 estate featuring an 8,900 - square - foot mansion sold in january 2013			1
@entity19 was built in 1896 and was once owned by @entity37 's niece @entity53			1
like many homes in tony @entity3 , @entity19 was purchased through a limited liability corporation to protect the privacy of its new owner			1
@entity38 would say only that the buyer is not local			0
video source @entity59 outdated : the house maintains much of its 1896 charm , from speaking tubes to sleeping porches re-decorating : buyers should have enough money in reserve to bring in an interior designer to update the dated decor according to a july 2013 @entity71 report , the $ 120 million selling price is actually less than the mountains of mortgages previous owner @entity74 had on the property			1
mr @entity74 owns timber companies , and when some of his lands ran into problems producing timber , @entity19 suffered			2
mr @entity74 bought the property with his wife @entity82 in 1982 for 7.55million and took out mortgages every so often to finance the estate			0
but in 2006 the amounts drastically shot up			0
mrs @entity86 took out a $ 59 million mortgage on the estate in 2006 with @entity89 , and the loan was personally guaranteed by both @entity91			0
before that mortgage , there was already a $ 41 million mortgage with @entity95			0
it was around this time that mr @entity74 's timber companies started to hit hot water			0
estate : much of the home 's value is in the fifty acres of land and more than a mile of waterfront property staff quarters : the main kitchen is located in the basement - an inconvenience for modern families who might want to cook for themselves luxury lifestyle : other amenities include a heated pool , tennis court , solarium and a formal garden at the start of the 2000s one of mr @entity74 's companies purchased $ 60 million in forest land in @entity118 , @entity119 , but the area ended up not producing much timber because of the presence of the endangered @entity123 and an infestation of spruce budworm			1
the area has become a popular second - home destination , but plans to develop the area into neighborhoods never happened			0
in 2006 mr @entity74 was hit with another obstacle - one of his companies in @entity132 went bankrupt			0
at the end of 2010 the @entity74 family 's $ 59 million mortgage on a part of @entity19 was cross-collateralized with a $ 79 million mortgage on the @entity119 forestland , both with @entity89			1
if the @entity91 fell behind on payments it meant the bank could sell either property and if they came up short , the @entity74 's would be liable			0
in addition to that mortgage , they had $ 65 million in mortgages on another part of @entity19 through @entity95 , bringing the total debt on the estate to $ 203 million			1
foreclosure proceedings on @entity89 's portion of @entity19 started in 2011 , but the @entity74 's filed a suit against the bank claiming ' predatory lending practices , ' and the following summer the suits were dropped			2
fixer upper : the house was put on the market for a record - breaking $ 190million , but the interiors could do with an update lots of room : the house includes 15,000 feet of living space and 12 bedrooms proper garden : the land is maintained by a horticulturalist with the @entity168 privacy : the house is set back from the road and accessed by a 1,800 foot - long driveway			2
