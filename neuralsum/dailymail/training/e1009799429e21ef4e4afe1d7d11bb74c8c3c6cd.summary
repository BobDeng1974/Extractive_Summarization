by @entity0 published : 16:35 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 05:11 est , 9 january 2014 should @entity3 sack manager @entity2 ? is there really any point in a second leg ? such was the emphatic manner of @entity10 ’s win in the @entity13 semi-final first leg here last night , they did not even need a second half			1
three goals up by the interval and coasting towards the final , @entity16 ’s side were every bit as dominant as @entity3 had feared			1
the trip to @entity22 in two weeks is nothing more than a formality , as is their place at @entity27 on march 2			2
@entity28 must take the plaudits for a well - taken hat - trick with his left foot but rarely can the @entity32 have had an easier night			1
video : scroll down for reaction from @entity2 and @entity16 jumping for joy : @entity28 scored a hat - trick for @entity10 against @entity3 on wednesday night looking glum , chewing gum : @entity2 looks like a beaten man on the sidelines at the @entity40 man city : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 7 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 ; @entity47 7 , @entity48 7 ( @entity49 66 , 6 ) , @entity50 6 , @entity51 7 ( @entity52 73 , 6 ) ; @entity28 8 ( @entity53 79 ) , @entity54 7			1

goals : @entity28 12 , 26 , 49 , @entity48 40 , @entity54 6 , 89 manager : @entity16 7 @entity3 : @entity62 5 ; @entity63 5 , @entity64 4 , @entity65 4 , @entity66 5 ( @entity67 75 5 ) ; @entity68 5 , @entity69 5 ( @entity70 57 , 5 ) , @entity71 6 , @entity72 5 , @entity73 4 ; @entity74 5 ( @entity73 45 5 ) subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 referee : @entity81 7 manager : @entity2 5 man of the match : @entity28 attendance : 38,000 at times , @entity3 ’s defending was amateurish			1
city do not need any help scoring goals — especially at the @entity40 where they now have 59 in 15 games this season — and there could have been far more on a night when they fired 32 shots at goal			0
@entity54 scored another two and the @entity95 had lost count of @entity10 ’s tally by the time he was interviewed afterwards , mistakenly thinking it was five			2
‘ that happens sometimes , ’ said @entity16 with a knowing smile after his @entity100 miscalculation in @entity101 last month			2
as it rained goals on a wet night in @entity105 , @entity2 stood under heavy skies while the @entity3 fans called for his head			1
in the stands , co-owner @entity109 , who gave his manager a vote of support this week , look equally unimpressed			0
@entity2 was axed by @entity114 shortly after a 7 - 1 defeat across town at @entity117 in 2010 , and on the sixth anniversary of his sacking by @entity120 he must have left fearing the chop again			1
lost cause : under - fire @entity3 boss @entity2 shouts instructions to his side in another heavy defeat @entity127 in class : @entity10 's @entity48 ( left ) wins the ball from @entity72 ( centre ) and @entity131 opener : @entity28 set the tone of the night with an early first goal for @entity10 double trouble : @entity28 slides in to grab his , and @entity10 's , second goal against a beleaguered @entity3 hat - trick hero : @entity28 curls the ball home to complete his treble on strike : @entity143 's third goal of the game on their way to the semi-final rout pitch battle : actress @entity148 ( right ) , a @entity10 fan , with fiance @entity150 from @entity151 , a @entity152 tickets for the second leg - now a mere formality - were on sale to @entity3 fans for £ 42			1
you unhappy @entity3 are probably best off saving the cash ... @entity16 , on the other hand , remains on course for his first trophy in @entity164 football and it will not be the only silverware in @entity10 ’s sights			1
even the cautious @entity168 struggled to say there was still any life left in this tie afterwards			0
‘ in football it ’s never finished , ’ he said			0
‘ but it ’s an important step to playing in the final at @entity27			0
’ the writing was on the wall even before kick - off			0
@entity3 arrived on a run of one win in nine games and fresh from a 5 - 0 @entity182 pummelling by @entity184 side @entity183 on sunday			2
jumping for joy : @entity28 leaps in front of delighted @entity10 fans as ' @entity188 ' wraps up his hat - trick familiar sight : @entity191 ( left ) and @entity71 look dejected as they are forced to kick off once again in february 1990 , @entity3 lost 6 - 0 at @entity193 in a @entity13 semi-final first leg			1
it proved to be manager @entity196 ’s final game in charge … @entity2 made eight changes from that game , giving a debut to centre back @entity64 , signed on loan from @entity202			2
it is no secret @entity2 would have preferred @entity10 ’s @entity45 but that deal is on hold			2
it always felt like a case of how long the @entity3 could hold out , and the answer was just 12 minutes			2
for all @entity10 ’s artistry , the goal was a route one creation straight out of @entity2 ’s box of tricks			2
back in the action : @entity54 rounded off the rout to further consign @entity3 's misery rare possession : @entity3 's @entity218 ( right ) takes the ball past @entity10 midfielder @entity50 hammered : @entity62 sits on the turf as @entity10 players celebrate after @entity54 netted his second of the night sliced open : @entity54 finds the top corner after some stunning interplay on the left wing for @entity10 's sixth tale of two bosses : @entity16 ( right ) looks content with his @entity10 side as @entity2 rages from the bench @entity48 launched a high ball from halfway between @entity64 and @entity65 , who had lost track of @entity28			1
the @entity32 had time to let the ball drop over his shoulder before executing an exquisite left - foot volley inside the near post			0
@entity48 was left writhing in pain after a tangle with @entity72 but continued after treatment			0
he had just limped back on when @entity10 scored their second goal in the 26th minute			0
@entity28 played the ball around the corner to @entity54 and broke upfield with @entity65 struggling to keep up			1
@entity54 ’s return pass sent his team - mate through and @entity28 slid in to steer an emphatic finish beyond @entity62			1
man in the middle : referee @entity81 took a tumble after he slipped in the first half tussle : @entity71 ( left ) attempts to put a challenge in on @entity10 playmaker @entity47 @entity254 's first goal - and @entity10 's fifth - came at the end of a ridiculous passing move			0
check out this and all the other stats from @entity10 's drubbing over @entity3 in our fantastic @entity260 here @entity28 tweeted this picture of his signed hat - trick ball with the message : ' good performance of the teammates			1
i 'm very happy with my 3 goals too ! here is the ball of the match			0
' @entity48 scored @entity10 ’s third five minutes before half - time after more shocking defending by @entity3 as he broke from halfway			1
@entity64 went into reverse while @entity63 and @entity69 gave chase , but nobody got a challenge in before the @entity10 player drilled the ball home from 10 yards			0
half - time brought no respite for the visitors as @entity10 extended their lead within four minutes			0
@entity51 ’s cross deflected to @entity28 , who made no mistake with another assured finish with his left foot			0
it was left to @entity54 to grab the last two goals , the first when @entity51 picked out overlapping @entity46 , whose low cross was turned in at the near post by the @entity291			0
then @entity47 ’s clever backheel let substitute @entity53 cross for @entity54 to crack in an emphatic sixth			0
the @entity3 fans turned on @entity2 , who stood impassively on the touchline as the rain came down			1
whether he will still be there when @entity10 go to @entity22 later this month remains to be seen			0
bad night at the office : @entity3 keeper @entity62 looks forlorn at the final whistle after conceding six goals turning the back : city fans celebrate with their famous ' @entity303 ' in the stands at the @entity40 magnificent : @entity28 struck the opener after getting on the end of a 50 - yard pass from @entity48 how it panned out : this graphic shows @entity48 's vision to find @entity28 for the opener			1

@entity28 scored *sublime* hat - trick in @entity13 rout
@entity54 netted twice and @entity48 also struck from midfield
@entity3 boss @entity2 under fire after another heavy defeat
second leg at @entity22 little more than a formality for @entity16
travelling @entity3 fans turn on @entity2 with @entity328 chants
