@entity0 held on to record a 2 - 1 win over @entity2 in their @entity4 clash at @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity6 gave the home side a half - time lead before @entity9 headed in a @entity10 cross early in the second half to bring @entity2 level			1
@entity13 then scored the winner with his first goal for @entity0 , but @entity17 's side needed a string of world - class saves from their goalkeeper @entity20			1
find out how the players rated at @entity5 here			2
@entity0 @entity20 - 8 guessed correctly to save @entity10 ’ penalty , the first @entity4 keeper to do so , and then made two outstanding late saves			1
@entity20 denies @entity2 an equaliser in the final minute , one of his many important saves on the day @entity28 - 7 made several vital interceptions and clearances , and also got forward well for the first goal			1
@entity32 - 6.5 could n’t have had a tougher physical test than facing @entity34 but contained the @entity36 ’s threat in the main			0
@entity38 - 6 still feeling his way into the @entity4 and looks a little uncomfortable , particularly on his right foot			0
@entity41 - 5.5 had better days			0
guilty of fouling @entity43 for the penalty and then lost @entity9 for @entity2 ’s goal			2
@entity41 brought down @entity43 in the penalty area to concede a first - half penalty @entity48 - 5 did little to show that he can make the transition from traditional winger to playing on the right side of @entity0 ’s midfield diamond			2
@entity54 - 5.5 back in the line - up for the suspended @entity56 but will be disappointed he did n’t make more of his opportunity			1
@entity54 was largely disappointing in an advanced midfield role for @entity0 @entity59 - 7 another assured and tenacious display as @entity0 ’s midfield anchor			1
booked for second of two poor challenges on @entity9			0
@entity6 - 7.5 fantastic finish for @entity0 ’s first goal , had a hand in the second and shone throughout with some exquisite touches			1
@entity6 gave @entity0 the lead midway through the first half at @entity5 @entity13 - 6 will be mightily relieved that he has his first goal for @entity0 because he wasted enough chances before that			1
@entity74 - 5.5 still looks some way short of his best and has yet to strike up a proper partnership with @entity13			0
@entity13 restored @entity0 's lead with his first goal for the club subs : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 ( for @entity86 79 , 5.5 ) , @entity87 , @entity88 ( for @entity41 71 , 7 ) , @entity85 ( for @entity13 73 , 6 )			2
scorers : @entity90 27 , @entity13 62			0
booked : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity86 , @entity85			0
@entity2 @entity93 - 6 former @entity0 keeper could n’t be faulted for either goal and made a fine save to deny @entity90 a second			1
@entity43 - 6.5 had his hands full with @entity90 but got forward well to win the penalty in first - half injury - time			0
@entity99 - 7 another accomplished performance from the young @entity102 centre - back and his late injury will be a concern for @entity106			2
@entity99 looked assured and comfortable once again in @entity2 's central defence @entity108 - 6 unlucky that his fine clearance led to the first goal but lost track of @entity13 for the second			1
@entity10 - 6.5 bound to be disappointed that he missed his first penalty in 15 attempts but wonderful cross for the goal			1
@entity10 saw his first - half penalty saved by @entity0 goalkeeper @entity120 @entity121 - 6 did what he could to hold @entity0 ’s forward at bay and booked for cynical foul on @entity13			1
@entity127 - 6 had a hand in the goal but missed out on a great chance to snatch an equaliser at the death			2
@entity133 - 5.5 struggled to make an impression down the @entity2 right			2
@entity9 - 7 took his goal brilliantly and a constant handful for @entity0 arriving late on crosses			0
@entity9 ( right ) headed in @entity2 's equaliser from a @entity10 cross early in the second half @entity142 - 6 neat backheel that led to the penalty but went off injured having been booked for tripping @entity28			1
@entity34 - 6 difficult task on his own up front			0
created one chance with great takedown but blazed over			0
subs : @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 ( for @entity155 63 , 6 ) , @entity156 ( for @entity157 77 , 6 ) , @entity158 ( for @entity43 78 , 6 ) , @entity159 scorer : @entity9 55			0
booked : @entity161 , @entity155 , @entity162			0
@entity163 man : @entity20 referee : @entity165 - 6.5 @entity17 – 7 @entity166 – 6.5			0

@entity20 saves a penalty from @entity10 and denies @entity2 with two more stops right at the death at @entity5
@entity6 scores one and *assists* the other for @entity0
@entity54 disappointed when given a chance in @entity56 's *absence*
@entity99 gave another assured performance in @entity2 's defence
