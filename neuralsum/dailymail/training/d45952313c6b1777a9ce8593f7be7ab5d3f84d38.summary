as identical twins @entity1 and @entity3 will share many experiences in their life - but they will never share the same birthday despite being born 18 minutes apart			1
@entity7 , 35 , from @entity8 , gave birth to the sisters either side of midnight on november 9 and 10			1
@entity1 came first at 11.55pm on the sunday weighing 4lbs 5oz , and @entity3 followed at 12.13am on the monday weighing 5lbs 11oz			1
@entity7 , a deputy manager for children 's services at @entity23 , said : ' i never actually thought it would happen			2
there are three sets of twins in the family already but they 're all non-identical			0
' so we were shocked when it was another set of twins but this time they were identical			0
' the closer it got to midnight , the more i was joking they could have different birthdays			2
they are such good babies , they are laid back and will only sleep together			0
' double vision : @entity7 already has twin sisters , twin cousins and an aunty and uncle who are twins , as well as her new twin daughters 18 minutes between them : @entity1 was born at 11.55pm on 9 november weighing 4lbs 5oz and @entity3 followed at 12.13am on 10 november weighing 5lbs 11oz @entity1 and @entity3 are the latest in a long line of twins in the family			1

but this is the first time any of the twins in her family have had a different birthday			0

he filled them with hospital name tags , bibs and a copy of their local paper from the day they were born			0
sister act : the girls will share many experience growing up - even if they do n't share the same birthday however , they will have to share the paper as there was n't an issue printed on sunday - the day @entity1 was born			1
@entity7 said they will let the girls decide when they are older whether they want to share a birthday or have their own celebrations on separate days			1
she said : ' when they are younger we will celebrate their birthday on the same day but if when they get older they want to have their own birthdays then that 's fine too			0
