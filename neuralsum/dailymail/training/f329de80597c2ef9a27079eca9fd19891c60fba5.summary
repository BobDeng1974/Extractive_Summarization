@entity0 was forced on to the defensive yesterday as he attempted to explain the all too familiar story of @entity4 domination over an @entity6 side led by a captain desperately struggling for any sort of form			1
@entity6 were transported back a year to their worst @entity11 nightmare on saturday when they were outclassed by a rampant @entity12 at the start of a @entity14 when they again made a late decision to make significant changes			1
this time it was @entity18 who was jettisoned at the last minute from an @entity6 side who were supposed to have been given maximum preparation time to settle before finally launching a challenge for that elusive first 50 - over title			1
@entity12 's @entity24 celebrates after dismissing @entity6 captain @entity25 in their @entity14 opener @entity6 coach @entity0 ( right ) has defended his players but knows they must improve significantly as a consequence of that , @entity28 came in for his first one - day international in six months and @entity31 , who has impressed at three both here and in @entity32 before @entity33 , was pushed down to the no 6 position			1
and @entity35 , who dropped century - maker @entity36 in the first over at the @entity38 , was not helped by the decision to take the new ball away from him for only the second time in 16 one - day internationals			2
a thumping defeat at the hands of the hot favourites is far from fatal to @entity6 's chances of making an impact in this tournament but it was the apparent muddled thinking that raised serious concerns about their progress			1
@entity6 are not meant to be experimenting now after the @entity11 were brought forward , to their considerable cost , to give them every chance of forging cohesive plans ahead of their 11th attempt to win a first @entity14			1
but @entity6 coach @entity0 passionately denied that @entity6 panicked ahead of their big @entity57 date with the hosts while also backing @entity25 to come through a woeful run which threatens to undermine his authority here			1
' it 's a red herring , ' said @entity0 when asked whether the late changes had unsettled @entity6 before a 111 - run defeat that could have been so much worse			1
' i can categorically say no. you do n't drop a catch because you think you should be opening the bowling			2
and both @entity28 and @entity31 would say they are versatile			2
they can play at three or six and @entity31 was very comfortable where he was			0
' yet @entity0 did hint that his young , promising but inexperienced side may have frozen in front of 85,000 in the face of a ferocious @entity4 outfit			2
' the players have to ask ' did we play the style and brand of game we wanted ? ' and if we did n't , we are going to have to look at how we do that			2
each individual will have to look and ask if they got the best out of themselves			0
' @entity6 batsman @entity31 plays a shot against @entity12 during the match at the @entity38 in @entity87 @entity25 's form has come under particular scrutiny in recent weeks @entity25 , made captain on the brink of the @entity14 when @entity6 finally stopped backing @entity92 in one - day cricket , is becoming @entity6 's biggest concern , not least because he is in worse form over the last year than the man he replaced			1
' @entity25 will be as frustrated as anybody , ' said @entity0 after @entity25 's fourth duck in five innings			1
' he wants a score			0
but he handles himself well and is practising and doing everything in the right way			0
' so this is a case for support			0
for backing himself and getting out there and trusting that his form will come back and his quality will come through			2
' @entity0 pointed to @entity25 's century against @entity12 in the first game of the tri-series as evidence that he is not under the same pressure as @entity92 found himself before @entity6 pulled the plug on him after a 5 - 2 defeat by @entity32			1
' there is a difference			0
for @entity92 it was over time			0
for @entity122 you 're going back less than a month since he scored a brilliant hundred at @entity124			0
that showed all the best of @entity122			0
it had brute power , placement and the pacing of an innings			0
he 's got to keep it simple and back himself to do the business			0
he is n't the sort of bloke to hide from this			0
he knows he has to go out and perform			0
' there was an honest admission from @entity0 that @entity6 , who are consistently leaking too many runs towards the end of a one - day innings and went for more than a hundred off the last 10 on saturday , got their bowling badly wrong			1
' it was n't just about execution , ' said the @entity6 coach			2
' our plans were n't as good as they should have been			0
there 's no point hiding from it			0
i think in this game the players were sucked into the width of the square boundaries and thought that ( short balls ) were their best option			2
we have under used yorkers			0
' a deflated @entity31 leaves the field during @entity6 's humbling defeat to @entity12 @entity36 puts in an assured batting performance for @entity12 at least there was the encouragement of an impressive contribution from @entity31 in his new position , the @entity164 batsman only being denied a century by a crass umpiring error created by confusion over the @entity171			1
' we all felt for him because he had played so well , ' said @entity174 's 98 cut short when @entity175 was run out when the ball should have been dead after an upheld lbw appeal			2
' there 's nothing we can do , really			0
the decision was made and what was right was the respect shown to the umpires			0
' it is very early in this tournament to get into ' inquest ' mode and it is expecting a lot of @entity6 , a one - day side destined to play catch - up because of their understandable prioritising of @entity193 , to challenge the big guns immediately			1
but @entity6 will certainly expect better when they take on @entity195 , another powerful one - day side on home soil , here in @entity199 on friday			1
' we know we were playing against a side at the top of their game on saturday but we also know we have to close the gap because the next time we play @entity12 it will probably be in the knock - out stages , ' added @entity0			1
for now @entity6 can look no further than making sure they actually reach those knock - out stages			1
@entity6 batsman @entity35 plays a shot during the @entity209 match @entity210 falls to the ground after playing a shot during @entity12 's @entity14 opener against @entity6			1

@entity6 were outclassed by an impressive @entity12 in a 111 - run defeat
@entity0 defended his players but expects them to raise their game
captain @entity25 is very obviously struggling for form
@entity6 take on @entity195 in their next game in @entity199 on friday
