' stranded : @entity7 , already two weeks overdue , went into labor just as july 4th 's @entity4 hit her hometown of @entity12 , @entity13 , where she was cut off from the mainland perhaps they should have called him @entity26 ? @entity27 is now two months old because she was so overdue , doctors had advised mrs @entity7 to rush to hospital if she felt ' any pains at all , ' she told the @entity31			1
her contractions kicked in at 4am on friday july 4 , just as the hurricane was hurtling towards shore from the sea			0

once they reached the flooded overpass , which had been blocked by police , an ambulance was called to the scene			2
as soon as it arrived , however , it was clear amid the howling winds and gushing water that crossing would be impossible			0
happy family : @entity7 poses with her son @entity27 and the boy 's father flooded : the only route to hospital was a main highway overpass ( pictured ) , which was dangerously waterlogged , and which the ambulance they had summoned could n't cross from there , a five - ton ' military - type ' truck was summoned , which was just high enough to navigate the waterlogged overpass			1
too high , however , for mrs @entity7 to reach ; heavily pregnant and standing at only 4ft 11in tall			2
in the end , she scaled the back of a first responder and scrambled into the truck , which sped off before she could even tell whether her husband @entity68 had joined her			0
he had , and by the time they finally reached the hospital , the story was already circulating and the media had beat them to it			0
to the rescue : a five - ton ' military - type ' truck ( pictured ) was then summoned , which was just high enough to navigate the gushing water , if a little tricky for mrs @entity7 to climb up into at only 4ft 11in tall happy ending : mrs @entity7 reached hospital safely and after a 14 - hour labor , gave birth to @entity27 at 6.30am the following morning			1
pictured , the truck crossing the overpass ( top ) and the stranded ambulance ( far right ) ' the doctor comes in and he 's like , " do you know you 're famous ? " ' mrs @entity7 told today			1

her son @entity27 was born at 6.30am on saturday july 5 , weighing in at a healthy 7.7lbs			1
' the first time they put him on top of me , he looked at me , and i looked at him , and it was the best part ever , ' she recalls			0
new mother : mrs @entity7 could n't be happier with her first child ( pictured ) - ' the first time they put him on top of me , he looked at me , and i looked at him , and it was the best part ever , ' she recalls the crossing : @entity4 forced water up to where this man is standing , several feet above its normal levels ( pictured ) mrs @entity7 adds that this was n't @entity27 's first brush with bad weather			1
she had her very first ultrasound the day of a huge january snow storm			0
