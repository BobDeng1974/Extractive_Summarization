residents of the picturesque hamlet of @entity11 in @entity12 were stunned when a senior property acquisitions manager told them ' you could live in caravans ' at a meeting between villagers and @entity18			1
their village has been earmarked for demolition to make way for the £ 43 billion route meaning dozens of residents living on green belt land could have their homes reduced to rubble			1
residents of @entity11 , in @entity12 , which will be razed to make way for @entity5 , were told to live in caravans accountant @entity32 is furious at being told to live in a caravan by an @entity5 representative stunning countryside : the high - speed rail link will go past the pretty hamlet of @entity11 in @entity12 villagers had said they wanted to remain living together as a community , replicating their village elsewhere in the area			1
but for that to happen they needed all 12 of the homes to be demolished , so they could obtain planning permission to build in a green belt area			1
this summer @entity5 committed to demolishing all of the houses , clearing the way for the community to approach @entity50 for planning permission for replacement homes however the rail company has now stalled , telling anxious residents they may have to wait at least three years before a final decision will be made			1
and at a meeting on friday , the suggestion was put to villagers that they could live in caravans until then			0
today locals living in the hamlet , where the average price of a property is £ 600,000 , reacted with anger to the suggestion made at friday 's meeting that they should live in caravans			0
accountant and smallholder @entity32 , who lives in a detached house in the village near @entity73 , said : ' am i supposed to run my accountancy business from a caravan and keep my sheep , ducks , turkeys and chickens in the caravan with me ? place of worship : @entity83 in the hamlet will see its entire community relocated from their homes the end is nigh : many of the village 's houses ( average price £ 600,000 ) will be demolished for the new rail line around half of the hamlet 's 12 homes are currently destined to be knocked down while the others will overlook the line ' @entity5 and the government are completely out of touch with the problems residents affected by the scheme are going though			1
' we just want to be able to get on with our lives			0
we have been living under the threat of demolition for four years now and we face another three years of uncertainty			0
' we came up with a viable plan , that is covered by law and supported by mps and the council , but they wo n't go along			0
' mr @entity32 said @entity5 had originally promised residents they would knock all the houses down so they would be able to relocate ' like for like ' nearby			1
but he said he and other residents had now been told they might not get permission to rebuild until just before the bulldozers move in			0
the father - of - two said : ' we told them we needed to move beforehand , so we can set up , build our new houses and run our lives			2
villagers are outraged to have been told to move into caravans while they wait for a decision on their new homes unsettling : residents in the pretty @entity12 village want to be relocated nearby as a whole community ' but during the meeting they said they could n't do that			1
the man from @entity5 was asked what we should do and he just told us to move into caravans			2
' my wife went berserk			0
they do n't care about us , about how our lives would be ruined			0
' he said said villagers were fed up of the rail firm ' evading and prevaricating ' when they were trying to resolve the problems caused by the proposed rail line			2
@entity11 resident @entity144 , 53 , said ' we have spent hours in spurious meetings and consultations with @entity5 and achieved nothing because it is clear that @entity5 are refusing take into account the plight of those whose homes and businesses are being destroyed by the scheme			1
' a spokesman for @entity5 said : ' we met residents including mr @entity32 to discuss their aspirations for their village , including safeguarding their land which will enable them to apply for full compensation			2
' the comment regarding living in caravans was part of a general discussion around several options for people who are relocating or in the process of building a new home			0
' we remain committed to reducing to a minimum the impact of @entity5 on the local community and environment in and around @entity173 and elsewhere			2
' this will be covered in the formal @entity175 which will be submitted to @entity176 and published for consultation alongside the hybrid bill at the end of the year			0

much of @entity11 in @entity12 will be demolished to make way for rail link
residents want to be relocated as a community but need planning consent
it can only be *granted* if all houses are razed - and @entity5 is stalling on decision
worried villagers were outraged to be told to live in mobile homes until then
£ 43bn high speed line will link @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199
