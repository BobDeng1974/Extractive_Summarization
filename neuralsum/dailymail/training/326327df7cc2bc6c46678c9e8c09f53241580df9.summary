patients are being put at risk because of a ‘ shocking ’ shortage of hospital beds , say experts			1
@entity5 has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head of population among 23 @entity11 countries after removing more than 50,000 in the last decade alone			1
an international report has found that @entity13 has more than twice the number of beds per head , while @entity17 has almost three times as many			1
the @entity5 has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head of population according to a new report by the @entity22 compared to 23 @entity11 nations only @entity24 – which has invested strongly in community care – has fewer hospital beds per head , says the study by the @entity22			1
@entity5 ’s ratio is only slightly better than @entity29 ’s			1
the @entity22 , which represents industrialised nations , compared countries based on how many hospital beds they had per 1,000 people in 2011 – the most recent year for which figures are available			1
the @entity5 came 29th out of the 40 countries surveyed or 22nd out of the 23 @entity11 countries on the list			1
@entity5 ’s figure was 2.95 beds per 1,000 people – compared with 6.37 in @entity13 , 8.27 in @entity17 and 13.4 in @entity42			2
the ratio was far lower than in former @entity45 countries such as @entity46 ( 9.37 beds per 1,000 people ) and @entity48 ( 6.55 ) – and lower than the @entity22 average of 4.83			1
in @entity11 , only @entity24 was lower than the @entity5 , with a ratio of 2.71			1
some 50,000 hospital beds have been lost from the system over the past decade according to a new @entity22 report @entity5 ’s figure was only marginally higher than the ratio in @entity29 ( 2.75 ) and @entity57 ( 2.54 ) , only a small part of which is in @entity11			1
experts warn that the bed shortage puts at risk the ‘ quality and safety ’ of @entity64 care , with the possibility that waiting times could start to surge			0
they say elderly people are being forced to endure long waits on trolleys for a bed to become free , while operations are too often cancelled because there us no bed available			0
@entity75 , chief executive of the @entity76 , said : ‘ these figures are shocking			0
this again shows a system stretched to breaking point			0
‘ it is consistent with stories we hear such as people being moved from one ward to the other to create bed space , patients being left waiting in corridors for hours , or being cared for on the trolleys while waiting for a bed leading to unsafe and undignified care			0
‘ there is overcrowding in the wards and corridors , which increases the risk of infections			0
‘ we have also heard about people being discharged inappropriately – sometimes in the middle of the night – again to free up beds			2
‘ the figures are indicative of how poorly the @entity5 is prepared for the needs of its ageing population			2
this situation must change and we can not put the safety of patients at risk			0
it is ultimately the patient who suffers			0
’ former communist states such as @entity46 and @entity48 have a greater number of hospital beds per head of population compared with the @entity5 the @entity22 report also reveals potentially dangerous levels of overcrowding on @entity5 ’s wards , putting the @entity64 at risk of superbug outbreaks			1
the ‘ bed occupancy ’ rate – the proportion of hospital beds occupied at any one time – has increased in the past decade			1
by 2011 , it had reached 84 per cent – one percentage point behind the level at which experts say there is a danger of infection being spread because beds are not cleaned often enough			2
the @entity22 average is 78 per cent			2
figures from the @entity137 show that since then the rate has increased even further to 86 per cent			0
the number of hospital beds has fallen by 50,000 in @entity141 alone since 2001			1
the reduction is because of budget cuts and a move away from having patients stay overnight in hospital			2
last night @entity147 , chief executive of the @entity149 network , which represents @entity64 hospitals , said : ‘ these figures show that @entity64 hospitals are operating at near full capacity all the time			0
‘ there is no slack in the system and trusts are constantly juggling their resources to meet patient demand			0
’ but a @entity137 spokesman said : ‘ bed numbers are not an accurate marker for good care			0
the @entity64 is treating people quicker than ever , and more care is being delivered in the community , so far fewer need to stay overnight – which is often better for patients who prefer being at home			0
‘ hospitals are also better managing bed capacity to cope with balancing peaks in demand for routine and emergency care			0

@entity177 has lost an estimated 50,000 hospital beds over the past decade
@entity46 and @entity48 have more hospital beds per head of population
@entity5 has the second lowest number of hospital beds per capita in @entity11
we are only marginally ahead of @entity29 and @entity57 according to the @entity22
