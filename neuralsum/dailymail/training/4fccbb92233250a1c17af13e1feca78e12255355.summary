@entity0 thinks @entity2 and @entity3 's defence should be held responsible for the defeat to @entity5 that crushed their @entity7 hopes			1
the @entity9 legend singled out @entity2 for his part in the 2 - 1 loss , saying the @entity3 captain ' could have done better ' in both goals that were scored by his @entity15 team - mate @entity14			1
the 1986 @entity7 hero thinks the skipper could have tracked @entity5 's @entity18 better for the first goal , before he ' made a mess ' by nodding the ball into @entity14 's path for the second			1
' @entity2 and the @entity29 defence must take the blame for both @entity5 goals			2
when @entity18 started his run before the first , @entity2 could have done better			0
' but @entity18 passed it perfectly for ( @entity51 ) @entity50 , whose sublime cross eluded the central defenders and found an unmarked @entity14 waiting joyously inside the box			0
' it was @entity2 again who made a mess of a long shot from the @entity60 goalkeeper after @entity3 had equalised			1
' the ball went to @entity14 , who once again found a lot of room in the penalty area before unleashing a ferocious shot			0
' you ca n't afford that with a striker of his class and @entity3 paid the price			2
' @entity0 says ' you ca n't afford that with a striker of ( @entity14 's ) class and @entity3 paid the price ' survived : @entity5 celebrate as they beat @entity3 2 - 1 to move up @entity76 and @entity0 thinks the game was won and lost between @entity14 and @entity78			1
' apart from scoring the only @entity29 goal , @entity78 headed one on to the crossbar and on another occasion , failed to beat the goalkeeper from close - range , ' he said			0
' it summed up the tale of the two strikers			0
' @entity14 became a hero by converting two of the chances he got , @entity78 capitalised on just one of several he had , and that made the difference in the fate of the teams			2
' @entity5 won because they were better in handling their scoring opportunities			0
' so close : @entity78 's header came within inches of going in , only for the crossbar to deny him back of the net : @entity78 caught in the goal after his header hit the crossbar against @entity5 frustrated : @entity0 thinks @entity78 lost out to @entity14 , and that was the key difference between the teams			1

@entity0 says @entity2 ' could have done better ' with @entity5 's first goal , then ' made a mess ' of the second
