by @entity0 @entity1 believes embattled @entity3 captain @entity2 is only still in the job because it would be a ' yet another pr disaster ' for the @entity6 to sack him now			1
@entity1 has also urged @entity2 to relinquish the captaincy and seek emergency help for his batting - for the good of himself and @entity3			1
@entity2 has found himself under increasing pressure both as skipper and as opener following a miserable run which has seen @entity3 lose seven of their last nine @entity16 and the 29 - year - old score just 129 runs in nine attempts			1
writing in his column in the @entity37 , @entity1 said : ' at the moment only politics are keeping @entity2 in a job because the @entity6 backed him so much that it would be yet another pr disaster if it sacked him now			1
' but the @entity6 needs his runs back more than anything else so a big decision has to be made			2
forget the bad headlines for once			0
' the @entity46 - born batsman does , though , believe @entity2 still has a lot to offer @entity3 if the left - hander can rediscover the form that has earned him a national record @entity51 centuries - two more than @entity1			1
' he should do what is right for @entity3 and resign the captaincy			2
he has shown he does not have the tactical brain to lead the side , ' said @entity1			0
assistance : @entity1 says @entity2 ( right ) should give up the captaincy and seek emergency help for his batting ' @entity3 badly miss @entity2 the opening batsman scoring 150 to set games up at the top of the order and , relieved of the captaincy , i do n't think it is too late for him to rediscover this form			1
' he could have another 10 years left but his batting requires emergency help and he needs to speak to someone away from the @entity3 set - up			1
he has to be honest with himself			0
' @entity1 feels @entity2 should seek advice from the many former internationals currently working as pundits , saying that is a valuable resource that is going to waste			2
he said : ' @entity2 needs people with experience of international cricket around him , which ( @entity3 coaching team ) @entity79 and @entity83 lack			2
' look at @entity84 working with @entity85 , @entity86 with @entity87 , @entity88 with @entity31			0
how many ex-international players have @entity3 had recently working with them ? none			0
there is so much knowledge in @entity95 cricket going to waste			0
' there are so many great cricket brains in the @entity99 studios			0
put that radio in your ear , listen to them on the balcony or in the dressing room and @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity88 or whoever could be saying something you did n't know and could implement in the game			0
' more to give : @entity1 ( left ) believes @entity2 ( right ) can still help @entity3 in the future if he sorts his batting out			1
