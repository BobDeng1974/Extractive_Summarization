the steady stream of goals and entertaining football in @entity10 was always going to run dry at some point , and no - one will be particularly surprised that it happened in @entity14 ’s @entity13 between these two nations on monday night			0
the first draw of the @entity17 – and a goalless one at that – leaves @entity20 favourites to qualify from @entity21 behind @entity22 if they can avoid defeat to @entity24 in @entity25 on saturday			1
the reigning @entity27 champions knew that this was arguably their best chance of a first @entity17 win in nine attempts going back to 1998 when @entity32 also celebrated their solitary victory over the @entity34 , but @entity36 ’s side were desperately disappointing			1

@entity32 , on the other hand , came for a draw and will be delighted that they got one			1
coach @entity109 has bristled at suggestions in recent days that his team are negative but they did what they do best ; keep a clean sheet			1
they arrived at the @entity17 with more of them than any other qualifier – although it has to be pointed out that their opponents on the road to @entity10 included @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , meanwhile , had scored fewer goals than everyone else , so it hardly had the hallmarks of a classic			2
the @entity24 started with an attacking intent but ran out of ideas as the match wore on			2
the pedestrian approach of @entity133 ’s @entity5 summed up their play and @entity135 ’s @entity86 was a major disappointment			0
his replacement just seven minutes into the second half , @entity87 , went close with two headers and @entity85 added fresh impetus when he came off the bench for @entity84 towards the end , but @entity24 simply did not carry nearly enough of a threat			2
they actually had the ball in the net as early as the seventh minute through the lively @entity53 , but @entity100 referee @entity99 ruled it out for a foul on goalkeeper @entity54 by @entity5			0
control : @entity133 wideman @entity86 takes the ball down on his chest for @entity24 committed : @entity32 's @entity151 slides under @entity24 's @entity53 to take the ball away aerial duel : @entity24 's @entity154 beats @entity32 's @entity39 in the air lost out : @entity5 loses possession as @entity151 nips into to take the ball away strength : @entity46 holds off the challenge of @entity32 defender @entity160 @entity53 had another chance moments later but he was beaten to the ball when @entity46 , @entity24 ’s top scorer in qualifying , muscled @entity48 off the ball and crossed from the left , and @entity83 ’s follow - up effort rolled inches wide of the post			1
@entity53 also troubled @entity54 with a clever freekick from 30 yards that had the keeper scrambling back across his goal to save just inside his right - hand post , but the best chance of the half fell to @entity32 11 minutes before the break from their first corner of the game			2
@entity180 striker @entity64 and @entity51 were their liveliest players and it was no surprise that they were both involved			0
@entity51 swung over the corner from the right and @entity64 , who had scored 10 goals in his previous 14 international appearances , met it with a firm header that brought a smart save from @entity77 who until then had been a virtual spectator			0
the second half produced little better			0
if anything , it got even worse and the final whistle was greeted with a chorus of boos from @entity24 ’s supporters			2
not since 1930 have we had to wait so long – 12 games – for a draw at the @entity17			1
@entity32 will be more than happy with a point , even though they will struggle to record another shutout against @entity22 in @entity203 at the weekend			1
for @entity24 , however , the pressure is definitely on			2
@entity24 's 0 - 0 draw , the first stalemate of this summer 's tournament , was n't exactly a classic			1
however , former @entity210 and @entity211 goalkeeper @entity209 appeared to fall asleep during the match			0
@entity214 midfilder @entity213 tweeted the photo of the pundit and joked : ' wow @ @entity217 really enjoying # @entity24 game ! hope he wakes up for @ @entity219 tonight ! ' stretched : @entity51 holds on to @entity81 's shirt as he falls to the ground leaning : @entity24 's @entity222 gets the better of @entity32 's @entity59 in the air eyes on the prize : former @entity226 defender @entity81 climbs highest to win the ball in the air team effort : @entity24 huddle around goalkeeper @entity77 ahead of kick - off thumbs up : two @entity32 supporters show their excitement ahead of monday night 's showdown			1

@entity32 and @entity24 play out first goalless draw of @entity17 2014
stalemate sees @entity32 earn first ever clean sheet at a @entity17 finals
draw means @entity20 are now favourites to qualify from @entity21 behind @entity22
