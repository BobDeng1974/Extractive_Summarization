by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 14:34 est , 21 june 2013 @entity1 has unveiled the world 's fastest electric racing car that can reach speeds of more than 185mph - twice the speed of current electric road cars			1
the @entity9 on @entity8 - @entity7 - is fitted with modified versions of the electric technology used in the @entity15 car maker 's @entity13 model			1
the @entity7 will make its race debut at next year 's @entity18 event in @entity19			1
@entity7 for short , the car can reach speeds of up to 185mph and will make its race debut at next year 's @entity18 24 hours event in @entity19 the @entity7 will compete under the @entity27 's ' @entity26 ' entry at the 2014 @entity18 event - an additional spot on the grid especially for vehicles that showcase innovative technology the technology in @entity1 's @entity7 car builds upon its electric designs in its @entity13 model			1
@entity13 stands for @entity38 , environmentally friendly , affordable , @entity39			0
it uses an 80 kw and 280 n - m front - mounted electric motor that drives the front axle , powered by a 24 kilowatt - hours lithium ion battery pack			0
this system is designed to create up to 90 kilowatts ( 120 hp ) power			0
the current @entity13 model can reach speeds of up to 93 mph and it goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds			0
the battery pack is designed to retain 70 to 80 per cent of its capacity for 10 years			0
the @entity13 also has an auxiliary 12 - volt lead - acid battery that powers the car computer systems including the radio , headlights and windshield wipers			0
a @entity58 version also has a small solar panel on the rear spoiler			0
@entity1 unveiled the car to fans ahead of this weekend 's @entity18 24 hour race			1
the car will compete under the @entity27 's ' @entity26 ' entry - an additional spot on the grid for vehicles that showcase new and innovative technology			0
@entity1 plans to test various types of engine and electric technologies in the new car over the next year to increase its performance for the race			1
these trials will then be used to create technology for future electric road cars			1
@entity1 said it will showcase these developments as they happen on its @entity80 channel and @entity81			0
the @entity7 design team was headed by @entity83 who was recently appointed as @entity1 's director of motorsport innovation			1
the technology in @entity1 's @entity7 is a modified version of the electric engine used in its @entity13 road car			1
the @entity13 reaches top speeds of around 93mph while the @entity7 can achieve 185mph @entity90 said : ' the @entity91 is a natural progression that follows on from the development of the @entity13 road car and the @entity96 race car prototype			2
' the technologies developed through the program will form part of future innovations for road cars			2
' the program is designed to develop multiple technologies to evaluate how they could be used for a future return of @entity1 at @entity18			2
we are investigating multiple options			0
the @entity108 rc model unveiled ahead of this weekend 's @entity18 race is a prototype			2
@entity1 plans to test various types of engine and electric technologies in the new car over the next year to increase its performance for the race an @entity7 driver can to switch between electric and petrol - powered drive			1
@entity1 's design team claim that this a technology that could be added to road cars in the future in addition to pure electric power ' a @entity126 option - where the driver can switch between electric and petrol - powered drive - is a future direction for road cars , so that will be tested in addition to pure electric power and other new technologies			1
' while current battery technology does n't provide the energy storage capacity to race a solely electric @entity18 prototype , @entity83 believes the development of the car will be an important step in the ' electrification ' of motorsport			1
' a car like this provides an incredibly challenging test bed for what could be highly - effective options for road cars			0
throughout the next year we will be testing multiple drive trains in an extensive test program , ' @entity83 said			0
@entity1 's cars currently do n't have the energy storage capacity to race a solely electric @entity18 prototype but its designer @entity83 wants to change this during the trials			1
he believes the development of the car will be an important step in the ' electrification ' of motorsport ' @entity1 is a leader in electric vehicle technology for the road , now we want to take those lessons learnt and utilize that knowledge base in the development of the new race car			2
' launched in 2010 , the @entity13 has become the world 's best - selling all - electric car			0
@entity1 launched the @entity168 in 2011 - a race car powered by the same 107 - hp electric motor that is used in the road car			2
the @entity96 uses @entity13 â€™s lithium - ion battery pack and 80 - @entity174 , 107 horse power motor .			0

@entity1 's @entity7 is more than twice as fast as current electric road cars
over the next year the @entity15 car maker will trial new technologies to *boost* the cars performance
it will then race at next year 's @entity18 motorsport event
