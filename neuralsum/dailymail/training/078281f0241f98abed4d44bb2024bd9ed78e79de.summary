by @entity0 @entity1 was accused of ' insulting ' middle - class voters last night after claiming that making them pay higher tax rates is ' good for them ' because it makes them feel successful @entity1 was accused of ‘ insulting ’ middle - class voters last night after claiming that making them pay higher tax rates is ‘ good for them ’ because it makes them feel successful – and more likely to back the @entity12			1
conservative mps were stunned when the chancellor made the explosive remark at a secret meeting at his @entity20 office , the contents of which have been leaked to @entity21			1
the disclosure came as mr @entity1 is poised to announce a @entity24 boost for the low - paid by raising the threshold for income tax to £ 10,500 , while rejecting pleas to stop more middle earners being dragged into the 40p tax band			1
mps at the meeting reacted with horror when he told them : ‘ let ’s not forget there are advantages in more people paying tax at 40p			1
‘ it means they feel they are a success and joining the aspirational classes			2
' that means they are more likely to think like conservatives and vote @entity44			0
' if they are paying 40p tax they have a greater interest in cutting government spending because they are paying for it			2
all the polling evidence suggests i am right			0
’ one mp who was present said : ‘ there was a stunned silence			1
i never thought i ’d hear a @entity44 chancellor say paying more tax is good for the middle classes			2
it was a @entity60 moment			0
’ another added : ‘ the 40p rate may not affect the millionaire son of a baronet like mr @entity1 but it is killing hard - working people who earn around £ 40,000			1
it was an insult and shows how out of touch this government has become			0
’ one @entity44 told mr @entity1 that his argument was ‘ illogical ’ : ‘ you can not argue that making more people pay 40p tax is good because they are more likely to want to cut government spending , while letting more people at the bottom end pay no tax whatsoever			1
’ the chancellor ’s claim was made at a meeting with senior @entity44 mps on the executive of the party ’s @entity79 on february 5			1
the group was led by 1922 chairman @entity82 and included @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
mr @entity83 was among those who challenged mr @entity1			1
the disclosure came as mr @entity1 is poised to announce a @entity24 boost for the low - paid by raising the threshold for income tax to £ 10,500 , while rejecting pleas to stop more middle earners being dragged into the 40p tax band he said : ‘ i simply do n’t follow your logic			1
what conservative voters really want is the same as all voters – that is to pay less tax , not more			0
' those on a higher rate want to pay a lower one and those on a lower one do not want to be dragged into higher one			0
that is one of the fundamental differences between us and our opponents and it has stood us in good stead for many years			0
’ the chancellor ’s team later contacted @entity44 tax rebels ordering them to stay quiet			2
‘ i was told that if i carried on speaking out , i was betraying the party , ’ said one			0
‘ the people who are betraying the party are not me but those who have abandoned our roots			0
’ ministers say mr @entity1 is determined to steal the credit from deputy prime minister @entity123 for lifting the starting rate for tax , due to go up to £ 10,000 in april , by at least another £ 500 next year			1
the policy was devised by mr @entity123 , but it is believed mr @entity1 is toying with increasing it by between £ 750 and £ 1,000 next year			1
increasing the personal allowance to £ 10,500 is worth an extra £ 100 a year – or £ 2 a week – to everyone earning up to £ 100,000 a year , at an annual cost of £ 1.5 billion			0
supporters of a rise in the 40p rate threshold say it would give higher earners approximately an extra £ 200 a year			0
but mr @entity1 ’s aides believe it would be seen as unfair			2
the claims were made at a meeting with senior @entity44 mps on the executive party of the @entity79			2
@entity87 ( left ) and committee chairman @entity82 ( right ) were present at the meeting also at the secret meeting at mr @entity1 's @entity20 office were @entity84 ( left ) , @entity147 ( right ) , @entity86 , @entity148 and @entity85 ‘ we ca n’t give the better - off £ 200 more and the less - well - off £ 100 , ’ said one			1
‘ the punters just wo n’t buy it and we have to listen to them			0
’ a @entity153 source said : ‘ @entity1 was making the point that under a @entity44 chancellor , people on the 40p rate are paying less tax			1
’ meanwhile mr @entity1 ’s @entity153 deputy , @entity160 chief secretary @entity159 , today takes a swipe at @entity163 chancellor @entity162 over the tax row			1
in his article , below , mr @entity159 attacks ‘ siren voices ’ like @entity162 who complain too many people are now paying the 40p rate			2
without referring to @entity162 , mr @entity159 observes pointedly that ‘ one of the leading exponents of this theory is also a noted denier of climate change ( so ) , it is no surprise they are completely missing the point			0
’ sources confirmed the jibe was aimed at @entity162 , a noted climate - change sceptic			0
the 40p tax band was introduced in 1988 by @entity162			0
