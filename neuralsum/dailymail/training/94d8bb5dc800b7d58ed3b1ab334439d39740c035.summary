after @entity1 confirmed his status as the pantomime villain of world football , @entity0 takes a look at some of the most controversial characters that the game has produced			1
from the @entity10 to the @entity12 ‘ animal ’ , it ’s a quite frightening list of misdemeanours			0
but who comes out as the number one pariah in football history ? 10			1
@entity18 arguably guilty of the worst foul in @entity22 history , the @entity19 collided with @entity23 , the @entity24 defender , leaving him unconscious at the 1982 @entity22 in @entity25			0
the @entity24 also lost three teeth in the incident			0
bizarrely , the referee awarded the free - kick to @entity30			2
shocking : @entity23 ( left ) lost three teeth after being fouled by @entity18 ( right ) in 1982 9			0
@entity31 a misunderstood philosopher or plain nasty ? certainly , there were a couple of screws loose in the mind of this @entity38 legend , who was banned for nine months and ordered to do 120 hours of community service after launching a kung - fu kick after being verbally abused by @entity41 , a @entity42 supporter , during a match at @entity44 in 1995			1
the @entity24 was dismissed six times in the @entity46 for @entity38 , averaging a red card every 24 games			1
into the stands : @entity31 was banned for nine months after his kung - fu kick on a @entity52 fan 8			1
@entity53 the man nicknamed as ‘ @entity55 ’ must go down as @entity57 ’s most controversial player			0
the striker was sent off an extraordinary seven times in 1997 alone and in a career littered with scuffles , feuds , manslaughter charges and a brief prison sentence , @entity53 earned a reputation as one of football ’s greatest villains			1
his relationship at @entity70 with strike partner @entity71 constantly hit the headlines , with the two always squabbling but forming a potent partnership , as @entity38 discovered in a 3 - 1 defeat in @entity57 at the @entity75 in 2000			1
in 1999 , he came under fire from animal rights organisations after he hired a circus to perform in his back garden and served whisky and beer to a chimpanzee called @entity83			0
feisty character : @entity53 was sent off seven times in 1997 and has spent a brief spell in prison in the past 7			0
@entity88 ‘ @entity92 of @entity93 ’ scythed down a young @entity89 when playing for @entity90 against @entity91 in 1983			0
the dreadful lunge severely damaged @entity89 ’s ankle and it is alleged that the @entity97 defender keeps the boot that committed the crime in a glass case at home and that he would wheel it out at parties to show guests			0
hacked down : @entity88 brutally scythed down @entity89 during the 1983 @entity105 final in agony : the brutal challenge by @entity88 left @entity89 with a severely damaged ankle 6			0
@entity109 a serial winner but also a serial offender , there were moments of shocking lunacy that verged on that of a sociopath			1
the knee - high smash into @entity118 and the stamp on @entity120 were startling as the red mist descended on the @entity122			2
the assault on @entity118 was a response to an incident several years before when @entity118 had stood over @entity109 as the @entity38 man suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury			1
@entity109 , who also left the @entity22 in @entity128 in 2002 after a furious showdown with manager @entity130 , wrote in his autobiography : ‘ i f * * * * * * hit him hard			1
the ball was there ( i think )			0
take that you c * * *			0
and do n't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries			0
’ horror tackle : @entity109 ( left ) was sent off for his premeditated lunge on @entity139 ( bottom ) in 2001 5			2
@entity141 perhaps the most uncompromising ( and frightening ) centre forward that @entity144 football has seen , ‘ @entity145 ’ was convicted of assault four times , the most famous being his headbutt aimed at @entity149 ’ @entity150 in 1994 , for which he received a three month prison sentence			1
he also butted a policeman , beat up a supporter on crutches and an assault on a fisherman at a hotel			0
he has since reinvented himself as a pioneering coach and he is working closely with the @entity161 first - team under @entity162			2
bang : @entity163 served a three - month prison sentence for headbutting @entity150 in 1994 4			1
@entity165 displaying his backside to @entity161 fans at @entity168 , stubbing out a cigar in the face of @entity172 youngster @entity171 and not forgetting a 74 - day prison sentence for assault , @entity165 is @entity175 ’s most highly - charged footballer			1
he also brought shame on himself in a @entity178 shirt when he lashed out at @entity179 and @entity180 , for which he was banned for 12 games			0
now rehabilitated as ‘ football ’s philosopher king ’ , to quote @entity185 , @entity165 was recently invited to be a panellist on @entity188 ’s @entity187			1
bad boy : @entity165 ( right ) was sent off for lashing out at @entity179 ( left ) in 2012 3			2
@entity89 the @entity190 has always been one of the most divisive figures in world football			0
the @entity194 , that horrendous kick on an @entity197 defender and the mad gaze into a television camera at the 1994 @entity22 , @entity89 was always one to attract controversy			0
he was suspended for 15 months in 1991 following a positive test for cocaine while playing for @entity203 and handed a suspended jail sentence for shooting journalists with an air rifle in 1998			0
troubled time : @entity89 is one of the most divisive footballers ever to grace the world stage bye ! the @entity211 captain was sent home from the 1994 @entity22 after failing a drugs test for ephedrine 2			0
@entity215 the former @entity217 and @entity218 defender was sent off 12 times in his career and was forced to come to a £ 250,000 agreement at the @entity222 with former @entity224 midfielder @entity223 in 2004			2
@entity223 suffered a broken tibia after a tackle by then @entity218 defender @entity215 in an @entity228 game in february 1998			2
the no - nonsense @entity229 became known for his brutal reducers and was described by @entity232 defender @entity231 as ‘ the most hated man in football			2
’ reducer : @entity215 ( left ) got a notorious reputation for some horror challenges during his career villian : former @entity217 captain @entity215 was once describes as ' the most hated man in football ' 1			1
@entity1 the shoulder - munching @entity240 has become the pantomime villain of world football , biting three players – @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 – in the space of four years			1
throw in the racist abuse aimed at @entity38 ’s @entity249 ( and @entity1 ’s subsequent refusal to shake the @entity24 ’s hand ) and it makes for a rather unpleasant character			1
three bites and you ’re out , @entity1			2
top dog : @entity1 has gained a villainous reputation in football for several offences hungry : @entity1 ( left ) has been banned for four months by @entity75 for his third opponent biting offence disgrace : @entity1 ( left ) was found guilty of racially abusing @entity249 ( right ) and banned for eight games			1
