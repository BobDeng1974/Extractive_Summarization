take a bunch of red - hot @entity2 peppers , stir in a simmering measure of brooding @entity6 volatility , bring quickly to the boil and pour down the throats of the @entity10 aristocrats who strolled in here as the champions of world football			1
poor old @entity14 had no chance			2
they are going home choking on that fiery recipe			0
@entity2 's @entity6 manager @entity19 refers to his players as ' my courageous rebels			1
' @entity23 : @entity2 gifted : @entity25 and @entity2 forward @entity24 played a key role in @entity14 's downfall when they play with the irreverent passion which lit up the @entity30 on wednesday night , @entity2 can indeed over-throw pretty well any established order			1
yet off the pitch the beautifully gifted @entity24 and his team - mates come across as the most relaxed footballers at @entity35 2014			1
that paradox is a major part of what makes this @entity2 team so refreshingly unpredictable to deal with			1
as a football nation they have learned to live with defeat down the decades so now they are taking their triumphs one by one , celebrating each as if they have won the @entity48			2
what do they have to lose ? these players or the multitude of fans , inside and outside the stadium , who made such an ecstatic racket that it might have been heard back in @entity57 ? team spirit : @entity2 boss @entity19 talks with the players during a training session on thursday nothing			1
not when they have knocked out the @entity48 holders with a team including two men who will be playing not in our @entity67 next season but down in the @entity69 ? defenders @entity71 , of @entity72 , and @entity73 , just relegated with @entity74 , shut out the multi-million pound talents of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 as if they were run - of - the - mill opponents on any old saturday afternoon in @entity81			1
but then rebels with a cause do n't tend to suffer from an inferiority complex			0
' we knew we could beat @entity14 , ' said @entity19			1
' they have been a great team for six years but we have always given them trouble by daring to attack them			2
the way we risk going at everybody			0
we also knew that success is not forever			0
' break time : @entity2 coach @entity19 with defender @entity73 ( centre ) and midfielder @entity94 this manager is a walking contradiction , too			1
for 90 minutes on the touchline he looks as if he is suffering an apoplectic fit			0
no sooner does the final whistle blow than he is gently embracing @entity100 , sympathising with his @entity102 counter-part and reminding him of how proud he should be of all those achievements			0
as for the players , they are from the people , of the people and united with the people			0
no prima - donna celebrities here			2
they mingle with their countrymen and women , happily posing for ' selifies ' , chatting about the game			0
and you suspect they sympathise privately with their couple of hundred of ticketless red - shirted fans who stormed the barricades at the @entity30 and broke through walls at the media centre in their bid to see the match			2
@entity124 did not have to force entry to the stadium but they did their bravura rampaging on the pitch			0
this group are no respecters of reputations			0
@entity133 , their captain whose assured goalkeeping provided a solid foundation for this victory which has changed the direction of world football , l warns the rest of the best when he says ; ' we go out to tackle every match the same way , whoever our opponents are			0
and now we have a weight lifted from us because we 've proved we are a strong team			2
' @entity81 learned how strong when @entity2 won that warm - up friendly at @entity147			1
@entity148 hot : @entity2 coach @entity19 celebrates the 2 - 0 win over @entity14 @entity150 blow : @entity152 ( 1st r ) scores @entity2 's first goal against @entity14 defeat for @entity14 , when it really mattered , was more profoundly devastating and all the harder to stomach because @entity24 helped inflict it on a number of his team - mates at @entity25			1
he was not one of the two scorers but he is their principle hope for progressing even further than the last 16 , for which they have already qualified so spectacularly			1
whether they do so may depend on them upsetting @entity165 the bold way they turned over @entity14			1
they and the @entity169 are both going through in high style but the losers of that final group game are most likely to face @entity35 in the first knock - out stage			0
and the host nation are the only ones about whom the @entity176 do nurse a paronoia			0
not surprisingly since a home win in a @entity48 qualifying game in 2008 represents their only victory over @entity35 in 21 years and 16 matches			1
not only that but their record against them is played 70 , won 8 , drawn 12 â€¦			0
might @entity187 be the one to make them fly in the face of such daunting history , if necessary ? maybe			0
since he had not enjoyed significant success as manager of a variety of clubs across @entity196 , he was an unusual choice to begin with			2
and perhaps , when asked if beating @entity14 was his best victory , he was being prophetic as well as philosophical when he replied : ' the best victory is always the next victory			2

@entity2 beat @entity14 2 - 0 to dump the @entity48 holders out of 2014 's *tournament*
@entity196 side have qualified for the last 16 , despite being *underdogs*
manager @entity19 will hope his team continue their rich form against @entity165
