by @entity0 ticks feed on animal or human blood a huge , red mark the size of a grapefruit was the first sign something was wrong			1
legendary literary agent @entity8 had just emerged from the shower in his house in @entity11 last summer when his wife @entity12 pointed to his leg			1
‘ on the back of my right thigh was a bright bull ’s - eye mark – you could n’t mistake it , ’ says @entity14 the crimson circle with a ring around it is immediately recognisable to many in @entity26 ’s @entity25 , the telltale first sign of an illness that is on the rise in @entity30 : lyme disease			1
@entity8 says : ‘ i went right away to an urgent care surgery near our house , and the doctor took one look and said , ‘ ‘ classic lyme disease			1
’ ’ ’ the disease comes from a family of bacteria called @entity41 , spread by ticks – small parasitic insects commonly found on animals but which feed on human blood given the chance			1
they attach for anything from a few hours to weeks , but their bite is painless , so it is often unnoticed			0
if the disease is transmitted , the potential symptoms are complex and difficult to overcome			2
and a growing number of @entity30 ticks are now carriers.in the early stages symptoms tend to comprise headache , weakness , muscle pain and fever – much like flu			1
eighty per cent of sufferers in the first few days develop the bull ’s - eye lesion , known as erythema chronicum migrans , or @entity65 in @entity68 , our strain of @entity31 can also cause a purple lump on the ear lobe , scrotum or nipple			1
but those with @entity65 are at an advantage as it makes diagnosis easier – if a doctor sees the mark			2
@entity8 pictured with @entity79 , on of his clients			1
the literary agent contracted @entity31 after being bitten by a tick @entity8 explains : ‘ i said to the doctor , “ why do n’t you do a blood test ? ” and he said , “ i ’ve seen thousands of these bright red circles , and thousands of cases of @entity31			1
” ’ the blood test for @entity31 is not wholly reliable			1
in many cases , without a positive blood test or @entity65 , diagnosis can be made based on symptoms and likelihood of contact with an infected tick			0
for many , however , the disease goes unchecked and undiagnosed			2
in @entity30 , where @entity31 is less common or known , studies suggest as many as 90 per cent of carriers do n’t know they have it			1
‘ cases in the @entity104 – as well as across @entity68 – are increasing , ’ says consultant microbiologist dr @entity101 , @entity30 ’s foremost authority on the disease			1
dr @entity101 , an expert on @entity31 said the number of cases in the south of @entity108 is on the up ‘ this could be because of increased housing in greenfield areas , but could also be due to rising populations of deer and ticks , due to global warming			1
’ with about 1,000 confirmed , treated cases per year ( only 15 per cent from infection overseas ) , if the proportion of undiagnosed incidents is as many as 90 per cent , then up to 9,000 @entity30 could be suffering debilitating symptoms with no idea what is causing them and nothing to stop the progress of the disease			1
as the bacteria spread , symptoms worsen			1
dr @entity101 says : ‘ it affects everyone differently			0
some do n’t have any symptoms and some , even after successful treatment , have post-infection problems that last for months			0
’ alongside the initial flu - like state , exhaustion can set in as well as mental confusion , depression , dizziness and heart palpitations			2
then , for about ten to 15 per cent , facial palsy , meningitis which triggers intense headaches and light sensitivity , or encephalitis , which can prompt memory loss , sleep disturbance and mood changes			0
finally , after a few months , chronic problems can take hold : paralysis , shooting pains , numbness , amnesia , vertigo , panic attacks , weakness in the legs affecting gait , joint problems , and even psychosis			0
‘ i was one of the lucky ones , ’ says @entity8 , leaning back on a sofa in his office in @entity165 , @entity166			1
‘ i was put on a two - week , high - dose course of the antibiotic amoxicillin straight away			2
’ another antibiotic – doxycycline – is used for @entity31 in @entity30			1
but while reassured about his own treatment , @entity8 , whose clients include @entity79 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 , was alarmed by what his doctor said next			1
‘ i told him i was going back to @entity108 and he said , “ under no circumstances go to a doctor over there			0
they understand nothing about it			0
just do what i ’m telling you and you ’ll be fine			0
” ’ this , combined with the fact that an @entity191 friend of @entity8 who contracted @entity31 ’s ‘ went to endless specialist hospitals and no one knew what was wrong with him ’ , persuaded him to speak out			1
‘ many gps are unfamiliar with it because it ’s not very common , ’ says dr @entity101			0
@entity8 said : ' i was one of the lucky ones ' a couple of days after @entity8 ’s @entity65 appeared , he starting having symptoms			1
‘ i remember vividly how depressed the disease made me			2
i ’m normally very up , optimistic and enthusiastic			0
but suddenly i was really low			0
' i could feel this melancholia descend on me			0
but i knew it was the @entity31 so i told myself , “ i ’ll get through this			1
” ’ with the depression came a great loss of energy and an almost constant headache			0
‘ by the end of the two - week course of antibiotics , the depression lifted but dull headaches continued for a while , ’ he says			2
dr @entity101 adds : ‘ some patients are given a diagnosis of @entity220 , or fibromyalgia [ chronic , unexplained pain ]			0
’ meanwhile , @entity8 is determined he wo n’t be put off spending time in his home in the @entity226 – or from golfing , even though he may have been bitten on the course			1
‘ i ’ve had leukaemia and chemotherapy three times so , for me , @entity31 was n’t nearly as bad as that , ’ he says			2
‘ but i will use insect repellent now			0
’ one tragic victim of @entity31 was @entity235 , 44 , who took her own life to escape ' unbearable ' symptoms that had left her needing a wheelchair and sometimes bedbound			2
her husband of 15 years , @entity239 , 46 , also committed suicide after watching @entity235 die			0
he was found at their home in @entity244 cradling pictures of @entity235 , and at the time of his death was being investigated for assisting her suicide			0
@entity235 took her own life to escape the ' unbearable ' symptoms of lyme disease it is estimated that up to 17 per cent of the @entity30 tick population carry @entity31			1
most are in the @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , the @entity256 , and the west coast of @entity258 , although some infected ticks have been found in @entity166 parks			2
there is currently no drug to prevent @entity31			2
in 2002 , a vaccine was introduced in the @entity26 but was later withdrawn because of concerns over side effects			0
lyme spirochetes , the bacteria which cause the disease the @entity269 reported positive results of a new vaccine trial last year but suggested it might not be available for three years			2
once someone is bitten and diagnosed treatment involves antibiotics			0
the best prevention is to avoid a bite - in wooded , forest areas and long grass , wear a long - sleeve shirt , tuck your trousers into your socks and use insect repellent			0
if you find a tick , remove it by gently gripping it as close to the skin as possible , preferably using fine tweezers and pull it steadily			0
never use a lit cigarette end , a match head or essential oils to force out the tick			0
these can cause the bug to regurgitate its stomach contents , causing infection .			0
