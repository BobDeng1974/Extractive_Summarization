four alleged members of rival gangs in the @entity3 prison system launched a hunger strike from solitary confinement that at one point in 2013 comprised 32,000 inmates - black , white and @entity8 - from 33 prisons , it has been revealed			1
the coordinated 59 - day hunger - strike by opposing , racially aligned gangs resulted in a second legislative hearing into @entity14 conditions in @entity15 in february during which the @entity16 unveiled a package of new regulations			1
from the @entity22 's @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , @entity23 , allegedly a senior member of the @entity24 ( an affiliation he denies ) , @entity26 , alleged minister of education for the @entity28 , @entity29 , allegedly a leader in the @entity31 and @entity32 , allegely one of three generals of @entity21 spent years shouting through cell walls to form a political alliance and organize the strike			1
unlikely allies : @entity37 ( left ) an alleged member of the @entity24 and @entity26 ( right ) , allegedly a member of the @entity28 @entity41 gangs : @entity29 ( left ) , allegedly a member of the @entity31 , and @entity32 ( right ) , an alleged leader of @entity21 the strikers ’ grievances centered on the solitary confinement policy that some experts consider the most oppressive in the country			1
the @entity3 prison system dictates that a confirmed gang member may be kept in the @entity14 indefinitely , with a review only once every six years - a policy more extreme than that for prisoners who kill another prisoner or guard			1
some inmates have lived at the @entity58 , where they are locked up 22 hours per day in seven by 10 cells , are not allowed phone calls and can not have face - to - face contact with other humans , for four decades , reports the @entity63			0
the strict isolation policy is not devised as a punishment , but rather functions to isolate dangerous gang members from the rest of the prison population , curbing gang activity			0
following a reorganization of the @entity14 to separate members of the same gangs in 2006 , the most influential leaders of each gang came to be housed in a ' pod ' together in a wing called the @entity78 away from underlings who could be relied upon to do their bidding , reports @entity81			1
behind bars : gang members sent to the @entity14 could expect to languish for decades solitary cell : the men spend most of their time in a tiny , austere cell @entity23 , @entity26 , @entity29 and @entity32 conducted a years - long conversation through drain pipes and holes in perforated doors , via secret notes and messages through lawyers , in which they became allies for the same cause and called themselves the @entity98			1
inspired by readings about prison protester @entity101 and philosophical works by @entity103 and @entity104 , the prisoners formulated their plan for a statewide hunger strike			2
for @entity23 , the idea that they were all members of a single prisoner class and that racial segregation into gangs was encouraged by prisons to keep them divided resonated , reports @entity81			0
the men sent letters to an activist group explaining the strike and the reasoning behind it , and asking their fellow prisoners to join them			2
letters to family and friends spread word of the action further			0
despite years without seeing another person , the influence of the men in their respective gangs was still potent			0
isolated : @entity131 , in a lonely spot near the @entity130 coast , is home to 1,100 inmates meals are delivered through a slot in the door and inmates have a court - mandated five hours of exercise per week in a concrete run ' @entity29 is , if not the most influential @entity31 member , right there at the top			0
once you put his name on something with orders , the southern @entity8 are going to do it , ' lieutenant @entity143 of @entity22 's @entity144 told @entity81			2
a former @entity21 member confirms his influence in the strike : ' it was @entity153 , 100 per cent , ' he said			0
by the time the hunger strikers were 40 days into their self - imposed starvation , 69 remained			2
the strike was finally broken on its 59th day after @entity26 convinced the others that a promise of a special hearing on conditions in the @entity14 was a victory			1
the state had already won permission to force - feed any inmate whose action put them close to death , reports @entity81			1
on september 5 2013 , the @entity78 ' suspended ' its action			0
at the hearing in february , officials agreed that the @entity14 needs to change			0
' we all agree that it is far too easy to get in and too hard to get out , and the stays in this environment have been far too long , ' @entity171 , an undersecretary of corrections , testified			0
new methods to validate gang activity have been devised and @entity179 , the chair of the @entity180 on @entity181 , has introduced bill capping the @entity14 confinement of a validated member or associate of a gang or security threat group at three years , reports @entity63 .			2

a hunger strike in @entity3 prisons took place last year
it was organized by four alleged leaders from rival racially aligned gangs from the @entity22 's @entity14
the men were in solitary confinement at the *facility* , which houses ' the worst of the worst '
the unlikely allies were protesting conditions in confinement , *including* that a gang member may be kept in isolation indefinitely , with a review only once every six years
they spent years orchestrating the strike in *snatched* conversations , shouting through walls and down drainpipes and passing messages through lawyers
they *communicated* their plan to other prisoners though letters to activist groups and friends and family members
at its beginning , *30,000* prisoners took part in the strike
by day 40 , 69 inmates remained on strike and the state won permission to force - feed them
the strike ended on day 59 , when the inmates won a promise of a special hearing on conditions in the @entity14
