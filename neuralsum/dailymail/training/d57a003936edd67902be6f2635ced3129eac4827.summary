a week later , she got a reply			0
reading the note , @entity18 recalls that ' he did n’t write like a guy who ’s on death row but like a @entity72 gentleman			1

according to prison regulations , the @entity158 ceremony was supposed to last 20 minutes and contain only a small amount of kissing , but throwing caution to the wind , @entity18 and @entity28 kissed constantly , and the wedding lasted over an hour			1
while @entity18 was engrossed in the moment , she realises now that the day was very hard on @entity28 , who nearly passed out from stress at one point			1
@entity28 had not touched another person for six years , and had barely been around more than one person at a time			2
that stress was just a taste of what life would be like when @entity28 was released from jail 12 years later , in part thanks to fundraising from @entity18 , and also because of celebrities such as @entity178 , and musicians @entity179 and @entity181 , campaigning for him			1
@entity28 was freed in august 2011 , thanks in part to campaigning and fundraising by @entity18 , after agreeing to plead guilty to the crime in return for not suing the state for wrongful imprisonment at first the couple lived in a @entity191 apartment of @entity192 , who produced the documentary @entity193 about the case , before moving to @entity196 , the town of the infamous witch hunts			1
