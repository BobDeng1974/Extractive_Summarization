with its thundering , round - the - clock traffic , @entity0 in @entity1 is hardly the place you would expect to find a row of houses purpose - built for painters to gather inspiration			1
but it ’s on this section of the @entity12 in @entity13 where you ’ll find a terrace of @entity15 and crafts - era dwellings known as @entity17 , which were indeed created as artists ’ homes			1
amid the rows of conventional @entity22 terraces that line this artery linking @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity1 , the eight houses stand out majestically with their soaring chimneys and red - brick and terracotta exteriors			1
but their most distinctive feature – north - facing double - storey windows – provides the biggest clue to the fact that they were designed for artists			1
the muted yet constant light that comes through the expansive panes would greatly enhance the conditions for any painter ’s work			1
inspirational : the reception room in the house on @entity43 , home of painters in 1891 , when the eight houses were built , the area was an altogether more peaceful setting than now , and a colony of artists , including @entity51 painter sir @entity50 , were already living nearby			1
landscape painter @entity52 and illustrator @entity53 were among those who made their homes here a century or so ago			1
the houses went on to attract residents from the arts in general – most famously the great ballerina @entity59 , as well as @entity60 , a bestselling author in the @entity61 who is better known today as having been married to writer @entity62			2
anyone with £ 1.3 million to spend can purchase 135 @entity0 , a house at one end of the terrace , which has been put up for sale by 92 - year - old @entity68 art dealer @entity67			1
the terrace was built by architect @entity70 , who picked the location – then called @entity72 – because of what was an almost rural view looking out over the playing fields of the fee - paying @entity75			2
let there be light : the double - height windows on the top floor was built specifically to suit ' bachelor artists ' and allow sunlight to flow into the studio @entity17 : the eight houses were build in 1981 to become the perfect home for artists and painters @entity70 designed the houses for ‘ bachelor artists ’			1
each property had a bedroom , reception area and a bathroom on the ground floor for the artist , and a scullery , kitchen and bedroom in the basement for a housekeeper			1
upstairs , the artists would work in the studio behind the vast window			2
though there was no major road nearby , @entity13 , which opened in 1874 to serve the @entity104 , lay immediately behind the terrace ’s small , south - facing gardens to provide a convenient transport link			2
but in the @entity108 , @entity72 became an extension of @entity0 , which was widened to become the @entity12 trunk road			2
meanwhile , @entity75 moved to nearby @entity111			2
first council flats were built on its old playing fields , followed in 1980 by @entity115			2
@entity67 bought @entity116 135 in 1971			0
‘ i had arrived in @entity24 from @entity117 and was determined to live in an area where there were artists and i found this community , ’ she recalls			0
‘ none was for sale so i just knocked on the door of @entity116 and asked the people who lived there if they were willing to sell			1
’ famous neighbour : ballerina @entity59 had a house in the same terrace on @entity0 no 135 ’s layout remains almost as @entity70 built it , except for one key detail			0
the previous owner had put in a ‘ false ’ floor dividing the double - storey window , and @entity67 has never removed it			0
rather than modernising the house , which was given a @entity139 listing in 1970 , she set about restoring it to how it would have looked in its arts and crafts heyday			1
‘ i scoured all the furniture shops in the area for items to recreate the 1890s look , ’ she remembers			0
as a result , walking into the house now , more than 40 years since @entity67 arrived , is like entering a time warp			0
there is no central heating and any potential buyer , while admiring the historic interiors , would probably be keen to bring it up to date			0
while @entity67 was keen to reverse time inside @entity116 , she says that outside , things have improved since 1971 , despite encroaching urbanisation			0
times a-changing : although it is now next to a busy road , the location was originally chosen for its ' rural views ' ‘ this area was a very different place back then , ’ she says			0
‘ there were still bomb sites with rubble strewn around and car parks where houses once stood			0
’ despite the grim environment , the house provided exactly what she wanted – a seat in a buzzing artistic community			0
‘ i remember @entity59 lived at the other end of the terrace and i had wonderful parties in the house with all the top art agents of the day , ’ says @entity67 , who has bequeathed her collections of @entity180 ceramics of the @entity182 dynasties and @entity184 drawings to the @entity185 @entity67 continues to be an active player on the arts scene but , with other properties in @entity194 and @entity117 , she no longer needs her home in @entity24			0
