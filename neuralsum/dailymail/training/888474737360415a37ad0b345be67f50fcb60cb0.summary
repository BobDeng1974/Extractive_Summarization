@entity0 this week hit headlines when it was revealed she owned a pair of bespoke trainers made of five different exotic animal skins including anaconda , stingray and crocodile			1
fans and animal welfare groups slammed the singer as ' cruel ' and ' spoilt '			0
now her husband , @entity13 rapper @entity12 , has been dragged into the controversy as it is revealed he has a pair of trainers made for him out of elephant skin			1
the shoes , which were custom - made last year by high fashion brand @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , the same brand behind @entity0 's trainers , use the elephant hide among nine other types of skin - almost all from exotic animals			1
and , of course , most shocking of all , elephant skin			2
the sneakers , which use the heavily grained hide in the side panels , are a customised version of the @entity64 and cost $ 2,500 ( around £ 1,664 ) a pair			2
@entity12 , who has been photographed wearing the shoes on many occasions , is obviously very proud of his exotic acquisition			2
when he received them he posted a picture on his blog @entity12 of one of the shoes on a podium in his house accompanied by the caption , ' condos in my condo '			2
@entity12 has been seen out and about wearing his @entity82 sneakers many times , here with @entity0 at the @entity84 , @entity80 game in november @entity12 posted this picture on his lifestyle blog ' @entity12 ' with the comment , ' condos in my @entity88 ' when he first got the shoes last october it must be stated that while the idea of trading elephant skin seems alien and shocking to many of us , the use of sanctioned elephant hide in the manufacture of leather goods is not illegal			1
elephant skin is used in everything from boots , belts and shoes to gun holders and pool cues , and many items can be bought easily on @entity107 and elsewhere online			0
it is legal to buy and sell the hides under certain conditions laid out in the @entity111 ( @entity112 )			0
@entity113 , founder of animal rights charity @entity114 says : ' there can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world , that a few people , can show so much disrespect for life as to order up the slaughter of the largest , most revered of animals only to make them into a pair of shoes			1
’ elephants fall under @entity128 of the @entity112 convention , which means they are considered ' not necessarily now threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade is closely controlled '			0
the elephant leather market , mostly based in the @entity13 and importing from @entity134 , trades freely over the internet			1
the ears and trunk , being a thinner and softer leather , are highly prized and often used for wallets			0
eight square feet of elephant skin is usually sold at around $ 400 ( around £ 266 ) , although regular deals often mean it can be purchased online for less			0
although one would be hard pressed to find a seller of elephant in the @entity145 , in other countries it is a highly valued skin that traders say is incredibly durable and has a ' rich texture '			0
@entity149 is just one of the multiple websites where elephant leather can be purchased @entity153 is just one of numerous companies that offers elephant skin to purchase online			1
the leather can be purchased in a variety of colours from honey through to vintage peat , as well as original grey			0
roje explain on their website that their elephant hide , which comes from @entity134 elephants , is obtained only under the ‘ strict requirements of the @entity168 ( @entity112 ) permit ’ they justify the use of the beautiful beast ’s skin by saying : ‘ the source of all african elephant skins come from culls once the elephant heard reaches destructive numbers to @entity134 tribes and nature			2
‘ it ’s very similar to our deer season in the @entity13			0
an average 8 square foot piece of elephant leather can be brought for about $ 400 , but there are often deals like these on the @entity153 website a variety of colours and finishes are available for elephant skin , as can be seen on the @entity153 website ‘ without culling , which outsiders often view as unethical , many @entity134 tribes would lose their homes and possibly be trampled to death			1
‘ designers , manufactures , and leather enthusiasts should not feel emotional or have guilt for using this leather as we are not creating a demand rather using a by product			0
we deal with reputable international partners who abide by all regulations and we never sell poached hides			0
’ but the truth remains that many of us feel a strong emotional attachment to these majestic beasts			0
elephants are not only a highly endangered species , but fiercely intelligent , remaining in tight - knit family groups throughout their life and many are repulsed by the use of elephant skin under any circumstances			1
speaking exclusively to @entity222 , @entity114 ’s founder @entity113 said : ‘ there can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world that a few people , so out of touch with the wonder of nature , can show so much disrespect for life as to order up the slaughter of the smallest , most vulnerable and the largest , most revered of animals only to make them into a pair of shoes			1
’ when contacted over the issue , the ceo of @entity23 , @entity240 , responded : ' no elephants were beaten , harmed , or killed in the development and crafting of the @entity82 sneaker			2
' all leather and exotic skins including elephant skin found in the ' @entity82 ' used by @entity23 are from a legal supplier in @entity249			1
' @entity12 is regularly seen wearing fur ( left ) and he and wife @entity0 wore matching black fur coats to president @entity253 's @entity252 ( right ) the ' @entity256 ' sneakers @entity254 designed for @entity0 also feature a plethora of skins from varying animals and have caused a huge uproar amongst animal rights activists			1

@entity12 's customised @entity263 by @entity23 are made of @entity265 skins including elephant leather
elephant leather is legal if international endangered species *law* is followed
skins taken from animals culled in areas where they pose a *hazard* to *locals*
speaking exclusively to @entity222 , @entity114 founder says : ' there can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world '
