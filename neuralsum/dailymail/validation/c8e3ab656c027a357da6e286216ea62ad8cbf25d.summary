this is the jaw - dropping moment a group of daredevils walk the tight roped hundreds of metres above the ground between colossal cliffs			2
on march 6 , local and international members of the highlining community ascended @entity7 in the @entity8 , 80 km west of @entity9 , for a weekend of death - defying walks at heights between 60 to 100 metres in the air			1
the past time involves fixing a one - inch thick rope between two mountains and walking in between them , sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever			2
while most people are confident walking on a rope low to the ground , the mental hurdle of doing so from a heart - stopping height coupled with the environmental variables such as sudden gusts of wind makes it vastly more challenging			2
@entity27 walks a highline at @entity29 in @entity7 , @entity8 , as part of a highlining meet - up on march 6 local and international members of the highlining community ascended on the @entity33 , 80 km west of @entity9 , for a weekend of death - defying walks between the rock faces @entity9 - based electrician @entity37 ( pictured ) said highlining was the opposite of thrill - seeking : ‘ it ’s actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space ' but @entity9 based electrician @entity37 , who took part in the event , told @entity48 highlining is the opposite of thrill - seeking			1
‘ it ’s actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space			0
in a way it ’s like the opposite of thrillseeking			0
’ @entity37 said the gathering , which was organised on social media , drew in over 70 experienced and novice highliners from across @entity60 and the world			1
‘ it went off without a hitch			0
there were guys from all across @entity60 , and even some from @entity68 and @entity69			0
you can tell the community is gaining traction , ’ he said			2

amazingly , some participants highline without any safety equipment whatsoever @entity78 @entity77 walks on a 60m highline ( left ) and @entity69 @entity80 of @entity69 ( right ) walks on a 90m highline @entity82 , of the @entity83 , takes a moment to reflect ( left ) , while another daredevil uses an unorthodox method at @entity29 the meet - up saw seven highlines used ranging from 8 metres 95 metres in length , anchored at heights ranging from 60 metres to 100 metres in the air			1
but despite walking above what most would see as horrifying heights , @entity37 said it is an ' extremely safe sport			1
' ‘ i wo n’t get on a skateboard or even play football because i find those are too dangerous			0
every safety mechanism in highlining has a backup and you ca n’t physically fall on to anything off the line			0
’ @entity104 is an extreme form of slackroping which sees participants walk between two anchor points set up with enormous elevation from the ground or water , sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever despite walking above what most would see as horrifying heights , @entity37 said it is an ' extremely safe sport ' the meet - up saw seven highlines used ranging from 8 metres 95 metres in length , anchored at heights ranging from 60 metres to 100 metres in the air @entity27 hangs from a highline after falling off			1
@entity37 said there have never been any deaths resulting from highlining he claims he has never witnessed a significant injury and there have never any deaths in the sport			1
@entity37 said he has been highlining for about four years , and while it ’s easy to pick the sport up , it becomes increasingly difficult once you progress beyond a novice level			1
‘ once you reach ropes 60 metres in length or more , it gets incredibly difficult , ’ he said			0
safety is paramount with numerous safety harnesses and procedures used to maintain a well measured and safe environment the crowd of 70 that gathered for the event shared a similar passion for adventure and the outdoors			0
