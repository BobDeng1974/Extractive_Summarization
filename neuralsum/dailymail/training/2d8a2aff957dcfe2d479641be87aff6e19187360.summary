by @entity0 a @entity2 pro-breastfeeding ad campaign is being re-worked after it fueled a storm of protest from women 's health groups over its highly sexualized nature			1
' give your breast to your child , do n't turn your back on them ' , read the ad banners , splashed across the chests of thin local celebrities in topless poses which expose their distinctly non-mummy - tummies			0
an anonymous official at @entity2 's health department has acknowledged that the campaign 's slogan will be changed and that its next phase may include more average , everyday mothers			1
ideal poster girl ? @entity2 's health department has caused protest over a recent sexed up ad campaign ( pictured ) to promote breastfeeding which states ' give your breast to your child , do n't turn your back on them ' @entity28 , director of the @entity29 , says of the ads : ' it 's not only a very terrible campaign in terms of how it looks , but it 's also the message that if you do n't breastfeed , you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame ' , according to @entity35			1
some activists have pointed out that the ads look more like shampoo or soap commercials - which routinely feature lighter - skinned , glamorous models - than a discussion of a serious problem			2
even one of the campaign 's stars , actress @entity45 , asked on @entity46 ' not be associated with the campaign of breastfeeding			0
' guilt - tripping ? these somewhat smug photos do little to address the reasons behind the fact that only one in seven mothers in @entity2 breastfeed exclusively in the first six months , as per @entity55 recommendations ' i did not authorize anything , and i think it 's in bad taste , ' she wrote , later releasing a statement to say that although she supports the cause and posed for the campaign , she was n't consulted on the final artwork			1
mothers and women 's groups were quick to accuse the government of making women feel guilty , instead of addressing the real - life barriers to breast feeding			1
one group of activists wrote a complaint letter to @entity2 's human rights commission , starting : ' [ the ads ] condemn mothers , rather than informing them about breast feeding , and they reduce a social problem with multiple players - fathers as well as mothers , workplaces , health authorities , and public spaces and the community at large — to one person : the mother			2
' hardly a mommy tummy ! many women have complained about the campaign 's use of thin , light - skinned local celebrities instead of more ' average , everyday mothers ' - which officials say they will alter ' it does n't look like they did any diagnosis as to why women do n't breast feed ' , agrees ms @entity98			2
' they just lighted on a banal argument that women were selfish and do n't want to mess up their bodies			0
' city officials released the campaign to address the fact that only one in seven mothers in @entity2 breast feeds exclusively in the first six months , which is the standard recommended by the @entity108			1
that is among the lowest levels in @entity111 , and health experts say it 's a serious problem for a country where millions live in extreme poverty and dirty water threatens health			0
mother 's milk is thus of vital importance because it ’s richer in nutrients and antibodies that protect newborns from infections			0
take it down ! even one of the campaign 's own stars , actress @entity127 ( pictured left and right ) , took issue with the way in which her image had been used to promote breast - feeding in @entity2 the city 's health department had intended to use the ads to publicize its broader effort of setting up dozens of breast - feeding areas : comfortable , screened - off rooms with sinks and refrigerators to hold breast milk			1
' it 's not only a very terrible campaign in terms of how it looks , but it 's also the message that if you do n't breastfeed , you are a bad mother and you are the one to blame ' but only three such centers currently operate in this metropolis of nine million people			0
women also face prohibitions on breast feeding or pumping at work , get about 12 weeks maternity leave on average , and often draw hostile stares if they breast feed in public			0
furthermore , @entity2 has yet to sign on to the @entity108 guidelines that restrict hospitals from handing out free baby formula and marketing their products to new mothers			2
it is unknown how soon it will be until the new , altered campaign will be revealed .			0

the ads were intended to address the fact that only one in seven mothers in @entity2 breastfeeds exclusively in the first six months
women 's health groups feel the campaign is ' guilt - tripping ' mothers
