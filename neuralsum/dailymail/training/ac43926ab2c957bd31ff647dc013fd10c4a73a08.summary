the undated photo , likely taken during @entity3 ’s five years in captivity , was posted on the social media site on wednesday by @ khorasan3 , an account associated with the @entity13 of @entity6			1
along with the image were the words ‘ # @entity17 solider # @entity3 with @entity19 # @entity5 leader @entity18 ( @entity20 ) @entity21 ( @entity22 )			1

the details have emerged as soldiers who served with @entity3 before he left his post in @entity6 in 2009 revealed they have still not been contacted by military investigators			2
questions : a new investigation has been launched to determine whether sgt. @entity3 , pictured , deserted his post or went @entity81 when he was reported missing in @entity6 in 2009 the former soldiers have said that they believe the @entity66 has failed to contact them because it has already made up its mind about how @entity3 ended up in the hands of the @entity5			1
members of @entity3 's unit - including the platoon leader - have previously said they believe he deserted his post in june 2009 before seeking out the enemy			2
but when he was swapped for five @entity49 detainees on may 31 , president @entity90 gave him a hero 's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by @entity3 's poor health			1
two - star general major general @entity95 is now conducting a new investigation to determine whether @entity3 did desert his post or went @entity81 , which would suggest he intended to rejoin			2
but for former platoon leader @entity66 sgt. @entity98 , who left the @entity66 in 2012 , the answer is the same as it always was			0
' i think it 's very clear he deserted his post , ' @entity98 told @entity102			0
' he thought about what he was doing , he mailed some things home , he walked away and we have witnesses who saw him walking away			0
left out : former platoon leader and @entity66 sgt. @entity98 , pictured in a previous @entity109 interview , said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened ' and if you ’re walking away in one of the worst , most dangerous areas of @entity6 without your weapon and gear , i do n’t believe you ’re planning on coming back			2
' former army sgt. @entity98 of the investigation , he added : ' they 've already concluded what they want to be said			0
they know exactly what happened			0
' former army sgt. @entity124 also said he had not been contacted by @entity66 officials , but said there are probably still sworn statements by the unit 's members made after he left the post			0
' i have confidence that they 're going to do what ’s right , ' @entity124 said			0
' i just feel this should 've happened a long time ago and it should 've been public			0
' @entity124 also believes that @entity3 deserted his unit , which means he should be court martialed			0
speaking out : former army sgt. @entity124 , pictured in a previous interview on @entity73 , also said he had not been contacted by @entity66 officials and believes that @entity3 deserted the unit @entity3 is now receiving outpatient care at @entity51 in @entity52 and has ventured off base to the library , a supermarket , stores and restaurants as part of his reintegration process			1
after his reintegration process , he will be assigned to an @entity66 unit , according to the official			0
