it 's midnight , and i ’m sitting by a fire swathed in @entity4 blankets - bourbon on ice clinking in one hand , the other incinerating plump saccharine marshmallows in the gentle flames			1
native americans in full traditional dress – one of them calls himself ‘ @entity12 ’ – are serenading our group with haunting songs			2
this is no inauthentic act cranked out for tourists , but a moving , thought - provoking reminder of an almost - lost @entity20 heritage			1
the native americans are not the only emblems of local culture to have been threatened			2
i am at @entity23 , the creation and domain of the glamorous @entity26 , whose life ’s work has been to preserve the last great @entity20 mustangs from oblivion			1
standing proud : @entity31 is home to an impressive number of wild horses she opened this resort last year , a 900 - square - mile reserve and not - for - profit luxury eco-resort in northeastern @entity39			1
former wife to oil billionaire @entity41 , and an ex-racehorse breeder , , @entity26 rescued 600 wild horses in 2008 after hearing that the government was planning to euthanise or sell more than 30,000 for slaughter			1
the animals encroach on federal land and so are rounded up at extortionate cost to the taxpayer			0
it was a prequel to setting up a foundation to save @entity20 ’s @entity52 , whose conservation is battled over between those who consider the animal an agricultural pest , and those who believe it is a symbol of pioneer freedom			1
‘ the story of these wild horses unites people			1
we ’ve created a playground that brings to life everything we imagined as children			0
but behind the fantasy , each guest is preserving a symbol of @entity20 heritage , and a symbol of freedom , ’ as @entity26 puts it			1
this place is a reminder of days when games of ' @entity77 ' were made possible by a bed - sheet tipi and faces streaked with lipstick			2
home free : some see wild mustangs as pests - but they are protected at this @entity39 retreat @entity26 ’s version of playtime is a surreal blend of high fashion and authentic ranch life			1
arriving at @entity90 – two hours drive from @entity91 and submerged within three mountain ranges – feels as though you are checking into the touristic lovechild of @entity95 and @entity96			1
candy - coloured hand - painted tipis , pioneer wagons and a cinnamon - coffee blend of migrating horses punctuate the brush			1
waking up on my first morning , a peachy glow floods through the painted canvas , a gentle way to greet the day and an unbelievable reminder that i slept in a tipi last night			0
( although , with its hardwood floors , leather armchairs , and luxuriant @entity113 cotton and hand - made quilts , the transition to camping is hardly challenging , and , if canvas does n’t appeal , guests can also stay in a sumptuous pioneer cottage			1
) we meet the famous @entity52 at feeding time when hordes of wild horses bashfully approach our wagon , their velvety noses pushing through the hay bundles			1
listening to their satisfied snuffles and admiring their heavily lashed eyes , it ’s hard to imagine how these placid beasts can be considered a nuisance			0
life under canvas : guests at @entity90 can opt to sleep in a luxury tipi we take off on regular saddle horses up @entity137 led by @entity138 , who is riding a broken - in @entity31			1
resident cowboy and rodeo champion , his spirit of adventure makes me feel i ’m in dusty pursuit of a steam train hiding a gang of runaway bandits			0
the 21st century , ultra-luxe reality check arrives when @entity26 meets our gang with a lunch of artisan sandwiches and homemade lemonade , taken under a canopy overlooking the valley			0
riding is by no means the only activity			0
there 's rifle shooting , lasso tutorials and archery under the guidance of former @entity163			2
for the slightly less authentic - but seriously fun - @entity166 experience , there are dune buggies , abseiling and mountain biking			2
each day is book - ended by the saloon			2
its rustic exposed woods and card tables are lantern - lit for pre-dinner cocktails and exquisitely arranged canapés			2
no peanut shells or nightly brawls here ; just amber evenings filled with roaring chatter and witty anecdotes from the guides @entity183 and @entity184			0
@entity26 tells us over the crackling fire that the resort is expanding to include nights where guests can sleep under the stars			0
no walls , no electricity – just wilderness under the inky night sky			0
creature comforts : for those who prefer walls to tents , rustic cabins are also available in bringing freedom to @entity52 in the wide - open spaces of @entity20 , @entity26 is bringing freedom to her guests too ; as well as a slug of the old @entity204			1
in this wifi-less zone , even the most driven @entity205 – and plenty come here , in their private helicopters , along with a dusting of @entity209 , though they wo n’t tell me who – cast off their shackles			0
children lose the playstations , iphones , and tvs and learn about archery , horse - riding and calf - roping , off - road vehicles , abseiling , and target shooting , or even learn to ride for the first time			0
the derelict gold mines and eerie ghost towns that are littered across the mountain ranges are evidence that the dream did n’t last for everyone ; but in this case , a happy ending seems assured			0
@entity231 ( 0843 7789926 , www.steppestravel.com ) offer a five night stay at @entity233			0
prices from £ 2,995 per person , based on two people sharing a tipi			0
@entity238 includes accommodation on a full board basis including return flights , most activities and excursions , and car hire .			0

it is home to a large *population* of @entity20 's native wild horses , mustangs
guests can stay in luxury tipis , and head out on *horseback* adventures
