two ' greedy ' @entity1 bankers who masterminded a £ 3million property fraud were spared jail after a judge decided they had already ' suffered ' enough			1
@entity5 , 50 , and his boss @entity6 , 54 , were both earning more than £ 100,000 - a - year but wanted to make more money using a mortgage scam			1
together they set up a series of fake companies in the name of @entity6 's family and then made applications for loans to ' tart ' up homes and sell them at a profit			1
the bankers , who were based at @entity21 's office in @entity22 , @entity23 , a bank owned by @entity1 , then fraudulently borrowed just under £ 3million over five years			1
walking free : @entity5 , 50 , and his boss @entity6 , 54 , ran a five - year £ 3million mortgage scam but were given suspended sentences because they had ' suffered ' enough the scam also boosted their bonuses to more than £ 50,000 - a - year - on one occasion taking it to £ 78,000 for @entity31			1
the mortgage applications were submitted to their own bank without the pair ever revealing who was behind them and they also decided to forge documents to inflate the value of homes			1
once their own bank , which is majority - owned by the taxpayer , lent them the cash they were able to buy two properties in fashionable @entity46 in north - east @entity47 and another yards from the sea in @entity50 , @entity51			1
two more were also bought in east @entity47 and @entity23			1
at one stage @entity6 was living in a house worth more than £ 1million and sitting on a £ 1.2million pension pot. he took £ 136,000 from one of the development companies alone and drove a top of the range @entity60 , the @entity55 heard			1
but because all the loans have been repaid judge @entity61 gave them suspended prison sentences not time in jail , saying they had already ' suffered ' and were ' embarrassed '			1
she said : ' i accept that it was not your intention to case loss to the bank			0
i accept you intended at all times for the money to be repaid and it has been fortunate the bank has not suffered			2
' i have no doubt that both of you have suffered in the time it has taken this case to come to court			0
' scam : the bankers borrowed the money to ' tart ' up properties like one in this @entity46 street so they could sell them on for profit portfolio : they also bought a property in this road in fashionable @entity50 in @entity51 , which is a street away from the seafront @entity6 's marriage has collapsed , he has lost his home and his pension pot has been reduced to £ 120,000 , the court heard			1
he claims he is ' financially ruined			0
' @entity5 suffers from heart problems , high blood pressure and such severe diabetes that it was thought his foot might have to be amputated			2
the pair were working at the @entity21 office in @entity22 , which at that time owned @entity1			1
the two bankers at the centre of the mortgage fraud took large sums of the cash at the height of the financial crisis			2
since 2008 mortgage applications have been much more stringent			0
before that period @entity1 was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world			2
the bank was founded in @entity120 in 1727 , but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the @entity123 too as the @entity125 capital became the world 's leading financial centre			0
@entity1 sealed its place at the top table of @entity125 banking in 2000 when it bought @entity21 , which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the ' @entity133 ' retail banks in the @entity125			1
@entity134 , right , became chief executive of @entity1 the following year and pioneered a gung - ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division			0
one of the biggest deals came when @entity1 joined a consortium to buy @entity142 bank @entity141 for £ 49billion , which was later revealed as a major overvaluation			1
with the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil , @entity1 was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations			0
the @entity148 felt it had no option but to step in , and in october 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £ 37billion of new capital			0
as the bank 's losses spiralled and it required even more bail - out money , the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent			0
much of the blame for @entity1 's troubles was attributed to @entity134 , who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004			0
they planned to take advantage of the booming property market to pay back the loans and cash on the profits			0
bosses at @entity1 discovered the fraud in october 2010 after @entity171 , then a relationship manager , took long - term sick leave and other people took over his work portfolio			0
the investigation then discovered that the companies used to make the loan applications were linked to @entity179 , the ' regional director for relationship management			0
' @entity6 resigned from @entity1 after 33 years service in december 2010 but it was not until last year that the two men were charged by @entity185			1
in interview @entity5 complained to officers that he was poorly trained and ' under a huge amount of pressure at work '			0
the scam involved sending through loan applications to the @entity1 credit department without disclosing that they were the beneficiaries			2
@entity6 and @entity5 concealed their identities using companies registered in the names of relatives of @entity6			1
@entity5 also used forged documents to inflate valuations for homes			2
during this time @entity5 received bonuses ranging from £ 48,000 in 2006 to £ 78,000 in 2008			2
@entity6 also received annual bonuses of around £ 50,000 between 2006 and 2008			2
' you were in effect greedy , ' said judge @entity207 , adding : ' you were acting in a breach of trust			0
it was sophisticated and sustained and to an extent involved others - the nominees of the companies			0
' the public must be discomforted by hearing the details of your criminal conduct			0
but it did not involve loss to your employers and the actual risk was at least limited			0
' you have expressed shame and embarrassment at what you have done - as well you might			0
' the judge gave @entity5 a 20 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered him to do 300 hours of work in the community			2
@entity6 was given an 18 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered to do 250 hours			0
@entity5 is unemployed but @entity6 has a job advising a company on personnel and was ordered to pay £ 2,500 of prosecution costs			1
@entity6 , of @entity234 , @entity23 , admitted three counts of obtaining a service by deception and one count of false accounting			1
@entity5 , of @entity240 , @entity23 , admitted three counts of obtaining a service by deception , one count of fraud and seven counts of false accounting .			1
