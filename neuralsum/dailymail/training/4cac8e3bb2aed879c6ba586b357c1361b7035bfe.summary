cutting back on fry ups could cut your risk of dementia , according to new research			2
a ‘ compelling ’ study has linked compounds found in fried meat and eggs with one of the hallmarks of alzheimer ’s disease			1
@entity12 is particularly problematic and the suspect chemicals are also found in many cakes , biscuits and pastries			2
warning : frying bacon and eggs causes fat and sugars to react in a way that could be gravely damaging the researchers said that reducing intake could help prevent the crippling condition – and may even help restore memory that has been lost			1
@entity27 experts said that with drug cures for @entity29 ’s still many years away , attempts to prevent the disease are of extreme importance			2
@entity29 ’s and other forms of dementia affect some 800,000 @entity27 and the number is predicted to double in a generation as the population ages			2
existing medicines are of limited use and several highly - promising pills and potions have failed to live up to their promise			1
the research , from @entity43 in @entity44 , focused on compounds called advanced glycation end products , or @entity47			1
they are formed when fat , protein and sugar react on being heated and are found in particularly high levels in bacon , sausages , pizzas and burgers			2
frying and grilling is particularly bad , while boiling does not lead to them being made			1
alternative : scientists advise people to poach their eggs instead			1
they insist we do not have to turn to raw food recommended : carrots and boiled brown rice are also healthy options better for our brains , the study found the researchers tracked the progress of a group of mice fed food containing levels of @entity47 proportional to those in a @entity80 diet and another group fed half the amount of the compound			1
their calorie intake was the same but only the mice on the age - rich diet suffered problems with memory , learning and co-ordination as they get older			1
they also made less of an anti-ageing protein and their brains contained beta - amyloid , a sticky protein considered a hallmark of @entity29 ’s			1
results of experiments on people were similarly striking			2
tests on healthy pensioners showed that only those who had high amounts of @entity47 they had in their diet became more forgetful over the coming months			0
steps : professors accept this is not a cure but a small step as they move towards developing drugs more work is needed but the researchers said cutting back on the compounds might help improve mental sharpness and ‘ combat the epidemic ’ of alzheimer ’s disease			1
diabetes might also be helped , the journal @entity121 reports			0
researcher professor @entity123 , who also wants to test a drug that mops up excess ages , advises that people steam and boil food rather than grill or fry it			0
she suggests that fans of a fried breakfast ditch the bacon all together and poach their eggs			1
the professor said : ‘ one should sue some inventiveness			0
one does not have to eat raw or tasteless food			0
’ @entity137 , professor of dementia research at @entity139 , said that the studies needed to prove that cutting back on @entity47 helps prevent @entity29 ’s would be lengthy			0
he said : ‘ in the meantime , crunch those carrots and reach for the brown rice			0
’ professor @entity145 , of @entity146 , said : ‘ these results are compelling			0
because cures for alzheimer ’s disease remain a distant hope , efforts to prevent it are extremely important			0
’ professor @entity153 , of @entity154 , said that the solution will not be as simple as cutting back on one type of food and eating more of another			0
instead , he hopes that learning more about what goes wrong in the body and brain will lead to new drugs			1
dr @entity163 , of @entity164 , said : ‘ this research is at an early stage , and continued investment in research is crucial to understand the significance of results like this			0
‘ the diseases that cause dementia are complex , and our risk of the condition is likely to be affected by a number of genetic and environmental factors that are not yet fully understood			0
‘ in the meantime , the best evidence suggests that a balanced diet can help lower the risk of @entity29 ’s , as part of a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise , not smoking , and keeping blood pressure and weight in check			0

fats and sugars stunt short - term memory and stop brain developing
study by @entity43 recommends poaching eggs
frying and grilling *creates* compounds that boiling does not
