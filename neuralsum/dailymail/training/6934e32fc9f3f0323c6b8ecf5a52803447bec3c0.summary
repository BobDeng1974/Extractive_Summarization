the detective who led the investigation into @entity3 's most notorious child abusers has claimed there could be another 17 unsolved murders at the hands of the brutal gang			1
former @entity9 detective @entity8 also believes investigation files relating to the group - which abducted , abused and murdered children during the 1980s - could contain vital evidence about a vip paedophile ring which allegedly abused boys at a @entity17 guest house			1
under @entity18 , mr @entity8 helped expose the murders of three children by a gang of paedophiles , of which fairground worker @entity23 was one of the ringleaders			1
the victims were @entity23 , 14 , six - year - old @entity26 and @entity27 , seven			1
a former detective says there could be 17 unsolved murders linked to a group of child killers including @entity23 ( left ) and that the investigation could hold evidence about a paedophile ring which allegedly abused boys at @entity37 ( right ) but detectives believed at the time that as many as 17 other abductions and murders were connected to the notorious gang			1
mr @entity8 said detectives worked on the premise that there were 20 victims involved in @entity23 's gang , but that only three were established			1
' it seems unbelievable but we were told there may have been twenty paedophile murders , ' he said			2
' we proved there were three and there may have been more			0
there are potentially 17 unsolved murders			0
' detectives at the time also investigated links between @entity23 's group and the @entity37 in @entity57 - where it is alleged politicians and other @entity61 attacked and abused children - but could not find a link			1
@entity9 last week launched a new probe into the possibility of murders linked to the guest house , which is at the centre of the inquiry into the establishment paedophile conspiracy			1
mr @entity8 told the @entity71 : ' the orchid files - if they still exist - could hold the key to renewed concerns over the handling of police investigations into two child abductions			1
' @entity37 came up in our inquiry but it was not within our remit at the time			1
it is in our system but we could not establish a link with @entity23			2
' @entity86 's father @entity85 ( right ) has claimed his son ( left ) was abducted , abused and murdered by a @entity89 paedophile ring which he says was linked to the guest house mr @entity8 believes the connection may have been through @entity92 , one of @entity23 ’s accomplices , who may have been a male prostitute at @entity37			1
he said : ' we had reason to believe he could have gone there in the past , but @entity92 would never cooperate with us			0
he would always just say " no comment "			0
and he is dead now			0
' he added : ' the lot we put away were dirty , disgusting individuals			0
i do n’t think their paths would ever have crossed with those visiting @entity37 because they moved in different circles			2
' yesterday , the families of eight - year - old @entity86 , who was abducted and murdered in 1981 , and @entity107 , 15 , who disappeared in 1979 , called on the @entity108 to see whether the two rings are connected			1
@entity86 , 69 , a retired magistrate , said a male prostitute told him that @entity86 was taken to the @entity37 where high - profile abusers attacked children			1
mr @entity113 recorded the conversation but when he presented police with the evidence , @entity9 ‘ pooh poohed ’ it and failed to investigate , he alleged			0
the skull and several rib bones of @entity86 were discovered in 1982 by pigeon shooters in remote marshland at @entity121 , at @entity122 , close to the @entity125 - @entity124 border			2
@entity86 , from @entity126 , south - west @entity17 , had vanished while shopping with his nanny and sister on july 29 , 1981 - the same day lady @entity129 and the @entity130 were married			2
in june 1982 , four months after @entity86 's remains were found , police raided the @entity37 and it was widely reported at the time that the raids were linked to the boy 's disappearance			1
mr @entity8 said the disappearances of @entity86 and @entity107 ' matched the modus operandi ' of @entity23 and his associates			1
@entity23 's gang worked by luring boys away while they were walking on their own			1
they also groomed them for abuse			0
@entity18 , which was wound up shortly after mr @entity8 retired in 1992 , resulted in @entity23 serving two life sentences for sexual abuse			1
meanwhile , detective @entity146 , who worked on the original case , told the @entity148 she had a feeling of ' misuse of power ' during her time at @entity9			0
miss @entity152 , a former detective chief inspector and the inspiration for the @entity157 tv drama series , said : ' there is clear evidence that something was happening at that guest house			0
it has been alleged several high - profile individuals also abused boys at the prestigious @entity165 ( pictured ) development in @entity167 ' if nothing has been done about it in retrospect , then mr @entity86 is right			1
either the police disbelieved it , or they covered it up one way or another			0
' i do remember that the officers were highly passionate about the @entity178 case , but for some reason we never managed to get anywhere			0
' she added : ' there was also a strong sense of the power of @entity186 and of politicians			2
it was very much a case of ' do as you are told			0
' the new probe into the guest house was triggered after another victim came forward alleging to have witnessed the murder of three boys , including one who was allegedly strangled by a @entity196 mp during a sex game			1
the @entity108 announced last week that it is investigating the possibility of murders linked to the @entity37			1
allegations of a vip paedophile ring 30 years ago are being investigated by @entity9 through @entity37 , launched two years			1

the late @entity212 mp @entity211 is one public figure widely alleged to have abused children from @entity215 close at the @entity37			1
as well as @entity37 , some of the abuse allegedly took place at flats in @entity165 , @entity167 , where some politicians had @entity17 homes			2
a spokesman for the force said it would not give a ' running commentary ' on the inquiries			0
@entity23 ( pictured right ) , a former fairground worker , earned his reputation as one of the country 's most notorious paedophiles when he was a leading member of a gang that operated from a flat in @entity233 , east @entity17			2
