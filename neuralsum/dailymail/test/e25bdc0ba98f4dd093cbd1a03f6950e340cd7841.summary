@entity0 reckons a supposedly easier run - in can swing second place @entity4 ' way ahead of @entity5 in the last month of the @entity7 season			1
his @entity9 side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again in the final weeks of the campaign			0
but while @entity16 's men have the momentum at present - beating @entity4 and @entity18 while @entity20 ' men also lost to @entity21 would n't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards @entity23 before long			2
@entity9 boss @entity0 believes that @entity5 will struggle to maintain their pace through the run - in @entity5 - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners @entity30 , including sunday 's match at @entity32 , while the @entity34 side take on their city rivals just once more			1
@entity4 : april 4 @entity36 ( h ) ; april 8 @entity9 ( a ) ; april 12 @entity30 ( h ) ; april 22 @entity37 ( a ) ; april 25 @entity38 ( h ) ; may 2 @entity39 ( a ) @entity5 : april 5 @entity30 ( h ) ; april 9 @entity36 ( a ) ; april 12 @entity40 ( h ) ; april 15 @entity37 ( a ) ; april 18 @entity9 ( a ) ; april 25 @entity39 ( h ) ; may 2 @entity30 ( a ) ' @entity5 got a good result against @entity18 last saturday to keep themselves in contention and i think it 's going to be close but i still believe @entity4 have the easier run - in , ' said @entity0			1
' they do have tough games as well including one against @entity30 and if they 're serious about finishing second , they need to beat the likes of ourselves and @entity36 at @entity23 this saturday			1
' the derby will take care of itself			0
i think it 's going to be really tight and i ca n't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated			0
' but the fact @entity5 play @entity30 twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season does n't help them			1
with @entity30 getting the trophy at @entity62 after that match , it does n't do them any favours as that 's a game @entity5 might need to win			2
' @entity4 were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat @entity5 4 - 0 at @entity23 then 2 - 0 at @entity32 and because of the lack of form @entity5 were showing			1
both wins were comfortable and suggested @entity4 had overtaken @entity5			2
although they 've been pegged back since , i still think @entity4 are slightly ahead			0
' @entity5 ' attacking midfielder @entity70 , on loan from @entity72 , scores against @entity18 at @entity74 the team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight , while the third team have a potential six			2
@entity0 's @entity9 team are virtually assured of a place in next year 's second tier thanks to a 14 - point lead over second - bottom @entity18 and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play @entity85 's strugglers on saturday			1
but the 34 - year - old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down			0
@entity0 added : ' we 'll play @entity18 and @entity38 which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table			0
' we still have to go to @entity36 and we 've got @entity5 and @entity4 at home so we 've got games that are meaningful for others			1
' there 's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal			0
' but it wo n't be a case of us not turning up			0
we want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places			0

@entity9 boss @entity0 believes @entity5 ' tough run - in could mean they miss out on second place in the @entity7 to @entity4
*rangers* face *difficult* *fixtures* against @entity30 and @entity36
