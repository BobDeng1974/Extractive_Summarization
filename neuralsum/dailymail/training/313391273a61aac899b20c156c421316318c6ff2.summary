for some parents it can feel like their children are never going to leave home , but spare a thought for adult giant armadillos			1
new research , using automatic camera traps , has shown at these rare and elusive scaly - skinned mammals have to put up with some extremely clingy offspring			0
scientists had thought that young giant armadillos struck out on their own to find their own territory at six weeks old , but research shows this is closer to 17 months			1
the findings suggest that giant armadillos may be nature 's equivalent of human parents who suffer from so - called ' full - nest syndrome ' , where their adult children stay at home well into their thirties			1
dr @entity34 , head of the @entity35 of @entity37 's @entity36 , made the discovery while studying an adult female armadillo and her baby			2
night time camera traps set up in the @entity43 tropical wetlands of @entity44 captured the never seen before intimacy between the mother and her son , which scientists called @entity17			1
dr @entity34 said : ' we discovered that young giant armadillos continue to interact and share dens with their mothers for much longer than previously thought			1
' he added that although the youngster began exploring and foraging on its own after six months , it continued to share a burrow for at least year after that			0
giant armadillos live in burrows in wetland habitats in @entity62 and although normally solitary , mothers seem to allow their offspring to continue living with them for at least a year after they can care for themselves dr @entity34 first captured pictures of the wild baby armadillo with his mother in 2012 and was able to watch as he grew up			1
while spending short amounts of time away from home foraging , @entity17 continued to regularly interact with her and either share her burrow or stay in another close by			0
it is still unclear exactly what age young armadillos finally break their ties completely from their mothers as @entity17 is continuing to cling to his patient mother			1
giant armadillos are ' ecosystem engineers ' that help to protect other wildlife in the @entity44 wetlands from the searing tropical heat , according to previous work by dr @entity34			1
using camera traps in front 70 giant armadillo burrows to take pictures of animals that came to use the burrows			2
published in the journal of @entity91 , the study found that the mounds attracted pumas , tapirs , a type of wild pig called @entity97 along with insects and amphibians			2
the burrows are thought to provide shelter for the animals from the heat during the day , and cold at night , by providing a stable temperature below ground			0
dr @entity34 said : ' think of them like wine cellars			0
' armadillos are the largest members of the @entity110 order of mammals that includes anteaters and sloths , part of a family that goes back at least 65 million years			0
covered in a flexible armour that consists of up to 17 bands of horn and bone , they can grow nearly five feet in length , weigh up to 110lbs and live up to 15 years			0
they have large powerful claws for tearing into termite mounds			0
however , observing these creatures in the wild is extremely difficult as they are nocturnal and spend much of their time in their burrows			0
giant armadillos are currently categorized as vulnerable by the @entity133 as habitat loss and hunting has reduced their numbers			2
dr @entity34 , a @entity137 researcher who lives in @entity43 , started studying giant armadillos in 2010 , using radio trackers and camera traps in an attempt to learn about their hidden lives			1
they found that gestation lasts five months instead of four and that they only give birth to one baby at a time , instead of two as had been believed			1
dr @entity34 believes the animals only give birth once every two years , meaning they invest huge amounts in raising their young			1
his findings could also have a dramatic impact on attempts to conserve the mammals , as it means their population growth rates are extremely slow			0
with such a low birth rate , they can easily go extinct in local areas , he warned			0
dr @entity34 was able to follow a mother giant armadillo and her baby , named @entity17 , from the moment of birth using specially designed night vision cameras that filmed their intimate parenting behaviour giant armadillos are rarely seen in the wild as they are nocturnal and tend not to live closely together so most research has been carried out on captive animals that have been kept in zoos dr @entity34 said : ' we have made lots exciting discoveries about their ecology and behaviour and interactions with other species and how their burrows are used by other species			1
' now he hopes his camera trap images of the giant armadillos can help to raise awareness of the secretive creatures			2
the pictures he has captured have been awarded a runner up prize in the @entity190 and @entity191 categories of the @entity193 2014 competition			0
dr @entity34 said : ' the worldwide recognition of these rare photographs helps share the wonder and passion we feel for the mysterious giant armadillo			2
' due to its low population density , nocturnal activity and secretive nature , the giant armadillo could become locally extinct without anyone noticing			0

*biologists* captured intimate relationship between mother giant armadillo and her baby in the @entity43 tropical wetlands of @entity44
scientists had thought young giant armadillos left the nest at six weeks old
but images show young male armadillo called @entity17 sharing den with his mother more than a year after he was capable of looking after himself
female armadillos found to give birth to just one baby every two years
study turns much of the accepted science about the animals on its head
it also has *implications* for how they are protected in the wild
