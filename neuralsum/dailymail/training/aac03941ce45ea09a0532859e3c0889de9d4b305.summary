@entity0 and @entity1 criticism : in a statement on her website , @entity4 mp @entity3 , pictured , said she would cease renting her £ 400,000 @entity7 flat to fellow @entity9 mp @entity8 a left - wing mp is pocketing £ 19,000 a year from the taxpayer by renting out her second home to a @entity9 mp – while claiming thousands in expenses to rent a third property for herself			1
@entity3 is today revealed as one of four mps involved in the controversial practice of renting out their taxpayer - funded second homes to fellow mps for profit			1
the practice is technically permitted under the supposedly tough new expenses regime imposed in the wake of the expenses scandal			0
but critics last night warned it broke the spirit of the rules – and recalled the worst excesses of the scandal that heaped shame on @entity32 three years ago			0
commons speaker @entity33 has now launched a bid to block the publication of details of @entity19 ’ landlords which would reveal which other mps are involved			1
@entity4 mp mrs @entity3 , a member of the @entity41 , rents out her £ 400,000 @entity7 flat to fellow @entity9 mp @entity8			1
mr @entity8 pays her £ 1,560 a month in rent – equal to £ 18,720 a year – which he claims back from the taxpayer			1
official records show that mrs @entity3 ’s mortgage fell to £ 562 a month in 2009 when interest rates hit their current low level			1
assuming the rate is unchanged , she is now making £ 1,000 a month in clear profit from the rental payments to supplement her mps ’ salary of £ 65,738			2
at the same time , mrs @entity3 , 59 , claims £ 1,473 a month – equal to £ 17,676 a year – from the taxpayer for renting a separate flat in @entity7 for herself			1
she also has a home in @entity56 , @entity4 , which she has owned outright for more than 20 years			2
the arrangement means she now has three properties , two of which are funded by the taxpayer			1
mrs @entity3 , a widow , also employs her 51 - year - old partner @entity61 as a ‘ senior researcher ’ on a taxpayer - funded salary of up to £ 42,000			1
she did not respond to calls last night and mr @entity61 declined to comment			0
but mr @entity8 confirmed he was renting from mrs @entity3 – and admitted he felt uneasy about it			1
portfolio : @entity3 's £ 400,000 @entity7 flat which she rented to fellow @entity9 mp @entity8 for £ 1,560 a month the @entity69 mp , who was elected at a by - election last year on a promise to ‘ win back the trust of the people ’ , said he rented the flat via an estate agent and had not realised it was owned by a fellow mp until her post started arriving			1
mr @entity8 said he had checked the arrangement with the @entity78 ( @entity79 ) when he discovered mrs @entity3 was his landlady			1
he added : ‘ @entity79 said there was nothing to stop mps renting out their flats , mps are allowed to do it			2
but if i am honest , i would not do it and if i had known beforehand that the flat was owned by an mp then i probably would n’t have taken it			0
you ’ve got to apply the test of how it looks to the man in the street , regardless of whether it ’s above board or not			0
’ mr @entity8 stressed he made no money from the arrangement			2
mps were banned from claiming for their mortgages on expenses as part of a bid to clean up @entity32			0
instead they get an allowance of up to £ 20,000 a year			0
the ban finally came into force last month			0
tenant : @entity8 , pictured with his wife @entity108 , had confirmed he was renting the property @entity79 said four mps are now renting to fellow mps			1
another four rent from former mps whose homes were subsidised for years by the taxpayer			2
official records show around 50 @entity19 claim rental expenses from the taxpayer while renting out their own homes in @entity7 or their constituency			0
commons speaker @entity33 has launched a bid to block the publication of details of @entity19 ' landlords which would reveal which other mps are involved mrs @entity3 , who was elected in 2005 , bought the flat for £ 300,000 in 2006			1
records show the taxpayer contributed more than £ 35,000 to the cost of her mortgage between 2007 and 2010			0
total payments are thought to top £ 50,000			0
other claims relating to the flat include £ 1,310 for a sofa bed , £ 219 for bedding , and £ 1,936 for carpets			0
she also routinely claimed the maximum £ 400 a month for food – all without receipts – and claimed £ 100 a month for a cleaner until the practice was banned			2
last night @entity143 , chief executive of the @entity144 ’ @entity142 , said : ‘ it was the cry that “ it ’s all within the rules ” combined with attempts to suppress the publication of claims that made the @entity19 ’ expenses crisis three years ago so toxic			0
‘ whilst the rules may not technically prevent mps from renting properties to one another , it is certainly against the spirit of those rules			2
’ @entity159 mp @entity158 , who has campaigned for @entity19 ’ addresses to be kept secret on security grounds , also criticised the arrangement , and called for a change in the rules			0
he said : ‘ if it turns out mps are doing this then people should be tackling @entity79 , asking why they are allowing it and , if necessary , changing the rules			0
