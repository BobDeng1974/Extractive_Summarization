@entity0 hopes @entity1 can emulate @entity2 and recover from a poor start to retain their place in the @entity5			1
the @entity1 have failed to win any of their opening nine games and have the worst record of any team in the top four flights of @entity12 football			1
last season @entity2 lost nine of their first 10 games but a stunning revival over the second half of the season saw them finish 11th , 12 points clear of the bottom three			2
@entity0 celebrates @entity1 's first goal of the season against @entity23 , the only time they have been ahead @entity0 has been one of his side 's better performers , but @entity1 are still yet to win a league game this season midfielder @entity0 sees no reason why @entity1 can not turn their season around , saying : ' we saw that last season with the likes of @entity2			1
we can take a lot of belief out of that and hopefully we can get that win and kick - start us			0
' i do n't think we 've been too far away			0
@entity2 away and @entity38 at home were two in particular that we could have got the three points in each game			2
' we were under no illusions how hard this season was going to be and it 's just that elusive win			2
hopefully we can get there			0
i think we 've given a good account of ourselves over the duration of the games and that 's the main aim			2
' the mood in the camp is exactly the same as it was last year when we were winning			0
you want to win every game but there 's a realism about that			1
the @entity1 midfielder says @entity2 's turnaround last season has inspired their sqaud manager @entity62 and assistant @entity63 look on as @entity1 continue to search for three points ' on a saturday , when you go home you reflect on the game - did you do your best ? - and i think everybody in the team can say that			1
' @entity0 celebrates his 26th birthday on saturday with a trip to the @entity71 to face @entity72			1
on paper , it is another daunting challenge , but @entity72 have not won at home in the league since the opening day of the season and needed a late equaliser to draw with @entity80 two weeks ago			2
@entity1 have already drawn with @entity81 , and @entity0 hopes being major underdogs can play into his side 's hands			1
' there are games that are not in your division , ' he said			0
@entity1 have conceded 16 goals in their first nine league games , and have scored only five times @entity92 scores the first of his two goals against @entity1 in last week 's 3 - 1 win for @entity96 ' there 's a league within a league and then you go through certain games and think that 's where you 're going to pick up points			1
but it does n't always happen like that and that 's why you need to look at every game the same			0
' when you go to @entity72 you need to stick to your game plan			2
we know how good they are and what quality they possess as a team and individually , but i think if we go there and stay compact and stay in the game then you never know what can happen			0
' one of the best moments of @entity1 's season came via the boot of @entity0 , who put them 1 - 0 up against @entity23 in the opening game at @entity124			1
@entity1 will be up against quality in @entity72 on saturday , with the likes of @entity127 and @entity128 @entity2 picked up important points against top teams last season , and @entity1 need to do the same the @entity132 came back to win , and it remains the only time during the campaign so far that the @entity1 have been ahead in a game			1
@entity0 has looked one of the most likely sources for goal - shy @entity1 , always willing to have a long - range shot with his powerful right foot , and he is desperate to add to his tally			1
' it 's one of the aspects that i 'm dying to do , ' he said			0
' last season i got nine and i was off this season in the first game			0
if the penalty goes in at @entity2 , i 'd have been up to two already			0
' you get fewer chances than you do in the @entity151 and when you get them you need to put them away			0
i think we 've been a bit naive at times in front of goal			0

@entity1 have picked up just four points in nine games
newly *promoted* side yet to win their first game in the league
but @entity0 *insists* @entity62 's side are keeping the faith
