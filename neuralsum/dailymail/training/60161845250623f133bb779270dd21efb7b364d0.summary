these daredevil highliners are the ultimate chillseekers - setting up hammocks hundreds of feet in the air			1
as they inch their way carefully along the thin wire , some are even happy to pull out a guitar and play some tunes			2
the extreme event , called the @entity10 , is in its third year , and takes place at @entity12 in @entity13			1
it is a large gathering for fearless folks to hone their skills without any form of competitive edge			0
the idea of adding hammocks was put forward by hammock manufacturer @entity22			2
highliners attach the materials to a strengthened ' highline ' as they walk out to their designated relaxation spots - 150ft high			0
snapper @entity27 captured the breath - taking shots as 22 people hopped into 16 hammocks			1
the meeting ran from 6 to 14 september , with 500 people attending			0
@entity27 , who also helped to organise the event , revealed it was difficult to capture his shots due to the remote location and steep , rocky surroundings			0
he said : ' the action lasted around an hour and it was amazing to see all those people hanging out in their hammocks - it was exciting to watch			2
' a special highline set up was rigged so that it could carry the weight of the many people on one line at the same time			0
' @entity48 was definitely the best highline event i have ever photographed			0
' let 's all hang out and do this again : the @entity10 is now a regular event , and will take place again next september a glorious place for a spot of relaxation on high : this spectacular image gives a hint of what the highliners find so appealing about a day in an elevated hammock the view up here is smoking : one thrill - seeker shows he is utterly unfazed by his location as he enjoys a cigarette it was hard work getting here , let 's relax : a group of highliners take in the view in blissful peace and quiet feeling cosy : this thrillseeker takes matters to even more extreme lengths by opting for a mini hammock that barely holds his frame all in a row : the event has been taking place since 2012 , and - now into its fourth year - attracts a healthy crowd sing when you 're winning : one daredevil keeps the afternoon going by playing a few tunes on his guitar heading for an early exit : the highliner on the right answers the question of how you get back to solid ground - you inch your way back along the wire up up and away : the hammocks look especially beautiful when photographed from the ground below time for another tune : spirits - as well as locations - are high among the highliners as the afternoon progresses a smile for the camera : the dramatic images were captured by photographer @entity27 @entity110 enchanted evening : the highline was specially strengthened to ensure it could take the weight of a large number of people at once just chill out man : a guitarist strums a tune while all around him the high wire experts relax			1
but how did he get the guitar there ? come join ! a highline walker heads towards his compadres who rest in a hammock on webbing stretched between rocks in the @entity13 @entity128 @entity129 : an extreme athlete makes the walk across a wire strung between the @entity128 thousands of feet above ground level nearly there : after his long walk across this tightrope enthusiast is almost at the other side now get back up there : losing your footing results in the inevitable , but a small safety rope stops this high wire enthusiast from plummeting to his death easy does it : a female highliner walks the line strung between rocks in the @entity128 as part of the gathering near @entity153 in northern @entity13 walk the line : a dramatic shot from low down shows three of the highliners criss crossing the gorge cosy in there ? this highliner is so happy to be resting in his snug hammock he 's catching 40 winks all tgether now , heave ! highliners tighten the webbings between rocks so they can continue to try new routes across the gorge that 's fairly high ! this shot shows just how far above the ground these thrill seekers are as they nonchalantly walk across the webbings then three came along all at once : @entity166 chat to each other , strung hundreds of feet above the ground and so to bed : a huddle of tents forms the makeshift village for a week as the highliners get some well - deserved sleep before another day of thrill seeking			1

thrillseekers gather at @entity12 in the @entity128 every year to hang from ' highlines ' stretched out over chasms
the @entity10 first began in 2012 , and is becoming a major event for daredevils in the @entity128
those with the nerve spend hours *sitting* in hammocks , and even playing guitar above the *vertigo* - inducing drops
