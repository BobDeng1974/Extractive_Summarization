while people might generally think of the average @entity3 male as tall , lean and well - built , research shows that perception is wide of the mark			1
in fact , the average mr @entity6 has a @entity9 ( @entity9 ) of 27 , which is comfortably in the overweight category , and not far off being classified as clinically obese			2
researcher , and graphic designer , @entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , compared the bodies of mr average from around the globe , as part of a body measurement project			1
so how does mr @entity21 size up ? the following graphic looks at the size of the average @entity3 man compared to his counterpart from @entity14 , the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 many see the typical @entity3 male as being tall and muscular , like @entity31 , pictured here in @entity33 average @entity3 male stands at 175.6cm tall and hits the scales at 85.9kg , giving him a @entity9 of 27 , which is smack bang in the middle of the overweight category the average mr @entity6 stands at 175.6cm tall and hits the scales at 85.9 kilograms , leaving him with a @entity9 of 27 , according to the @entity40			1
it 's far from the rippling image of @entity43 or @entity31 , but the average @entity3 is still leaner than mr @entity44 , whose @entity9 is 29 and stands up at 176.4cm , reports @entity46			1
mr @entity28 is the healthiest , with a @entity9 of 23			0
mr @entity26 stands at 183.3cm and a @entity9 of 25.2 , while @entity27 comes in at 25.5 at 174.4 cm. the results highlight the growing threat of obesity in @entity6 , which increases the risk of heart disease , diabetes , and increased blood pressure			0
while the average @entity3 male might not be as buff as he 's often perceived , another recent study published in the @entity56 revealed super-muscular male body types seen in @entity58 are not attractive in some cultures			2
for example , in @entity44 , softer , more feminine looking men are perceived as more attractive			0
last year , graphic artist and researcher @entity12 used data of the average @entity14 woman to create a graphic of an average barbie , then pictured her next to a standard barbie it 's not the first time that @entity12 , 24 , has endeavoured to reshape body image perceptions			1
last year , he used the measurement of an average @entity14 women to create a graphic of a barbie with these proportions , then pictured her next to a traditional barbie			2
scaled up to human size , mr @entity79 found @entity81 was grossly disproportionate and would have a @entity9 of 16.24 , which is considered severely anorexic			0
the study reignited the sentiment that the doll was promoting unhealthy body image in girls			0
@entity12 spoke out about the artwork , saying ' if we criticise skinny models , we should at least be open to the possibility that @entity81 may negatively influence young girls as well			0

*quintessential* @entity3 male often thought of as tall , lean and well - built
in fact , the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) of the average @entity3 bloke is 27
this leaves him only a few kilos short of being *medically* obese
graphic artist in @entity13 , @entity14 , compared average men around the world
@entity3 came in *slightly* leaner than the average @entity14 , but do *n't* live as long as mr average @entity28
