it was as all going so swimmingly in defence for @entity2			2
@entity5 was fit after @entity6 , @entity4 ’s recent displays were markedly better , @entity7 was looking like a player who could displace @entity9 at left back and @entity10 was finding his feet since graduating from the club academy			0
for 56 minutes it looked like @entity2 would earn a fourth consecutive @entity15 clean sheet			0
then they allowed @entity18 too much space to drill home the equaliser , before @entity5 lost the striker in the lead up to the late winner			0
back to square one , it seems , in the space of 30 minutes			0
two mistakes , two goals and back to the drawing board for @entity30			1
@entity30 , pictured talking to the linesman , was n't happy with @entity33 's performance the @entity34 watches on as @entity35 replaces @entity36 in the 68th minute the @entity34 is also likely to be worried about the way his side were dominated by @entity39 , but instead he tried to deflect attention from such deficiencies by criticising referee @entity33			1
his comments could well land him in trouble with the @entity44 , but no amount of referee - bashing could hide the fact that his side were second best			1
‘ i was n’t happy with the referee			2
i felt , like us , he was not at this best , ’ said @entity30			1
‘ i believe we made too many technical mistakes compared to our usual level — we lost balls we are n’t used to losing			2
’ @entity33 shows @entity2 striker @entity53 a yellow card during the @entity15 clash			0

@entity30 stated he ' was n't happy with the referee ' after match
he also said he felt his side made too many mistakes during 2 - 1 loss
the @entity44 may *decide* to *punish* @entity30 after his *post-match* comments
