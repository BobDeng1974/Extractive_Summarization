the @entity0 is licking its wounds after losing a special election in @entity3 that turned into a referendum on @entity5 , suggesting that the president has become an albatross around the necks of congressional candidates – and spelling election doom for november			1
election prognosticator @entity11 wrote in january that the 13th @entity14 race was one that @entity0 ' ca n't afford to lose			1
' @entity15 , the losing @entity16 , also lost a statewide race for governor in 2016 by a razor - thin margin , but carried the 13th district by 2 percentage points			1
@entity5 , too , prevailed there in both of his elections			0
but the special election , created by the october death of longtime rep. @entity26 , was a different story			0
jolly won by nearly 2 points in a race that cost the candidates a whopping $ 12.7 million			1
and republicans of all stripes are crowing about it			0
congressman - elect : @entity36 @entity35 was all smiles after defeating @entity16 @entity15 in an election that is seen as a referendum on @entity0 ' policies the agony of defeat : losing congressional candidate @entity15 ( c ) was consoled by her son @entity43 and her daughter @entity45 ( r ) after she delivered a concession speech tuesday night @entity15 was ' ultimately brought down because of her unwavering support for @entity49 , and that should be a loud warning for other @entity0 running coast to coast , ' said @entity54 chairman @entity53 tuesday night			1
@entity35 , the former @entity26 aide who won the contest , told @entity57 viewers on wednesday morning that @entity15 lost because her party embraced @entity49			1
' i think it gives @entity0 reason to worry going into november , ' he said			2
@entity63 , who runs the @entity65 's @entity64 , blasted @entity15 for ' align [ ing ] herself with @entity68 and his anti-gun agenda , ' and said @entity35 prevailed because of his ' commitment to protecting our fundamental @entity71 to keep and @entity73			2
' the @entity74 took credit for mobilizing evangelical christians			0
@entity77 , the group 's chairman , said in a statement that @entity81 's victory showed the november elections ' will be a referendum on the failure of @entity49			2
' the @entity85 , a conservative group that promotes candidates who favor restrictions on abortion , claimed that the outcome was ' an early win for the pro-life movement			0
' @entity15 ’s ' extreme pro-abortion views , ' said the group 's president , @entity93 , ' put her far outside the mainstream			0
' when @entity11 handicapped the race in a january @entity100 column , he wrote that ' a @entity36 victory in march would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the president			2
' ' and that possibility should worry the @entity110			0
' high - fives , for now : @entity35 celebrated tuesday night but will have to defend his seat in november @entity35 's victory was cheered by the late former congressman @entity26 's sons @entity117 and @entity118 ( r ) , whose father succumbed to cancer in october @entity35 's win came despite @entity15 outspending him 3 - to - 1 on television ads. but the @entity122 insists special elections are usually a ' poor predictor of november success			1
' renowned political prognosticator @entity11 set the bar high for @entity0 two months ago , saying they could n't afford to lose in @entity3 's 13th district			1
that theory will be tested this year , since @entity35 must stand for re-election along with the other 424 members of the @entity133 the @entity134 reported that as @entity15 conceded the race , some of her supporters shouted , ' november ! november ! ' according to the @entity16 did not , however , say whether she would run again for the seat in this year ’s general election , the newspaper reported			1
outside political groups , whose attention was focused on the only congressional race this month , spent heavily on attack ads slamming both candidates			0
that money will be spread thin in november , especially in @entity150 races that have drawn the most attention as indicators of @entity5 's potential lame - duck status			0
' i have very good news tonight , ' @entity35 told supporters are his victory party : ' no more commercials			0
' famed game show host @entity159 introduced him in a video message , shouting his well - known line from @entity163 : ' congressman @entity35 , come on down ! ' @entity35 's win could indicate broad disenchantment with the @entity110 's handling of @entity49 , the @entity171 tea - party targeting scandal , the @entity174 terror attack in 2012 , the @entity166 's broad digital surveillance programs , or any of several other negatives that the president will carry into november			1
the president did n't campaign with @entity15 despite flying to @entity3 for a golf trip less than a week before @entity176 .			2

@entity35 's win over @entity15 in @entity3 's 13th @entity14 may be a *bellwether* for @entity0 ' november woes
the @entity3 13th district race was the first real test of how well – or how poorly – *democrats* are handling the @entity110 's scandals
the contest could be seen as a referendum on @entity49 , although @entity36 special interests are *spinning* it as a victory for gun *rights* , *anti-abortion* policies and a host of other *narrow* positions
the campaigns spent $ 12.7 million on the only national election fought this month , but the victor will have to stand for re-election in november
