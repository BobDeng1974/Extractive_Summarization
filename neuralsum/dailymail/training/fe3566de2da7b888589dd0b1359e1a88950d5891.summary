by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 3 august 2013 @entity2 's @entity1 went off for the first time in eight years on wednesday evening , drenching delighted visitors with its unexpected display			1
the eruption went on for nine minutes from 7:30pm and blasted water and steam up to 300 feet in the air			1
the geyser continued to emit plumes of steam high into the sky throughout the night			1
@entity1 is the most fickle of the @entity15 's roughly 500 geysers , and no one knows when it 's going to erupt next			1
holy grail : among the park 's rangers , @entity1 is the holy grail of geysers , its unpredictability making its eruptions highly anticipated the park 's most famous geyser , @entity26 , is the antithesis of @entity1 , which is at once the world 's tallest and least reliable geyser			1
in 1969 , @entity1 went off 29 times			1
once , it stood quiet and silent for 50 years , lying dormant between 1911 and 1961			2
it can be months or years between blasts , making its eruptions highly anticipated			2
@entity26 , on the other hand , erupts predictably , 91 minutes after a blast longer than two - and - a - half minute blast , or 65 minutes after a blast shorter than two - and - a - half minutes , and has been called the most predictable geographical feature on @entity38			2
so why are the two geysers in the same park so different ? lucky : only around 30 to 40 visitors to the park were around to witness @entity1 shooting 300 - foot columns of water and steam into the air like clockwork : @entity26 erupting in 1912 as onlookers sit down for the show scientists conducting studies with remote - sensing instruments that monitor underground activity still are n't sure what motivates @entity1 's eruptions			1
' most geysers are non-predictable , ' @entity55 told livescience			0
' those that are predictable , like @entity26 , are quite rare			0
' geologists believe that geysers like @entity26 have a narrow conduit that leads from an underground cavern			0
before it erupts , water and steam gather in the cavern and when the pressure becomes too great , steam shoots water through the conduit and out into the air			0
geysers are hot springs that are characterized by their intermittent eruptions of water and steam			2
they are among the most rare natural phenomena on @entity38			0
geologic conditions , such as hot springs and volcanoes , must be present for geysers to exist			0
most of the world 's geysers are spread among five countries : park geologist @entity84 said that @entity2 's geysers are fed by an underground plumbing network where the park 's volcano heats the water and forces it to the surface			1
so far , however , the force that decides that it 's showtime for @entity1 has eluded geologists			2
they 've tried to link @entity1 's eruptions to external forces , such as earthquakes , but no link has been evident			1
' we are still searching for clues for what would make it behave as it [ does ] , ' @entity55 said			0
' as of now , we do n't know			0
' @entity1 's last blast was in 2005			1
park officials said only about 30 to 40 people saw wednesday 's eruption , who reported hearing a roar and feeling the ground shake before the eruption			2
national treasure : @entity2 , mostly in @entity110 but also parts of @entity112 and @entity113 , was established as a national park in 1872 and contains around half of the world 's geysers venting : the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity110 , erupting on june 7 , 2003 @entity118 , a freelance photographer from @entity119 , @entity120 , who witnessed the blast spoke to @entity123 about the event			1
' it was an amazing experience			0
this thing sounded like a locomotive , ' @entity118 said			0
' everybody was frantic , taking pictures			0
people were running down there trying to get to it before it went away , and park rangers were running around trying to gather up people so they did n't get too close			0

@entity1 erupted on wednesday for the first time since 2005
it 's the tallest and least reliable of the world 's geysers , half of which are in @entity2
its eruptions are completely unpredictable
it once went off 29 times in one year ; another time it lay silent for half a *century*
the eruption lasted nine minutes , but the geyser emitted plumes of steam for *24* hours afterwards
