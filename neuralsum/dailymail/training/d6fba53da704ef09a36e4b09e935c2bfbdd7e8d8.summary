by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 20 june 2013 pensioners are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places thousands of older people are being left in hospital beds for weeks on end because of a critical shortage of home helps and nursing home places			2
an international report found ' bed blocking ' patients are stuck on wards unnecessarily for an average of 30 days – the highest level since the last election – putting their recovery at risk			1
campaigners said the ' bleak ' study raises a fresh @entity24 scandal , on the heels of a meltdown in accident and emergency and out of hours care			1
the problem in @entity32 's elderly care is highlighted in a report by the @entity34 , which represents industrialised countries			1
it found that in january – the latest month for which figures were available – some 4,200 patients were kept unnecessarily in hospitals for a total of 126,000 days			1
that works out at an average of 30 days per patient spent waiting to leave even though there was no clinical reason for them to be there			1
just after the @entity49 came to power , in august 2010 , the average was 22 days , according to the @entity34			1
hospitals are forced to keep such patients because they are too frail to be sent home on their own			1
campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital , and also risk superbug infections			2
they say councils should provide home helps or free adaptations such as handrails to enable elderly people to leave hospital			0
alternatively , they should be put in a care home for a limited period until they are ready to go to their own house			0
many town halls say they can not afford to provide these services after recent cuts – forcing the @entity24 to step in			1
the @entity73 's @entity75 campaign has repeatedly highlighted the plight of older people as local authorities increasingly restrict social care to those with ' critical ' or ' substantial ' needs , and home care has been slashed – with 20,000 fewer people receiving support			0
delayed discharges have cost the cash - strapped health service around £ 260million since the election			0
@entity89 , from charity @entity90 , said : ' this is not just a real waste of resources			0
unnecessary and lengthy hospital stays can seriously undermine an older person 's recovery			0
campaigners say elderly people deteriorate if they are left in hospital , and also risk superbug infections ' these figures are an insight into the increasingly bleak reality of the social care crisis where funding has failed to keep pace with demand			1
' the steep rise in the length of time people are waiting ... suggests something has gone seriously wrong in the transition to home or residential care at a time when we know social care spending has fallen so dramatically			0
' the care system urgently needs an injection of funds and a long - term commitment to sufficient resources			0
' the @entity34 report , entitled a good life in @entity126 , said delayed discharges result from ' inadequate capacity in nursing homes or home - care services and support '			2
it said : ' waiting times are regarded as an indicator of poor access and a major challenge for delivering high - quality care services			0
' waiting may occur when older people needing long - term care are discharged from acute care to a more appropriate care setting such as community care and residential care for which there is a waiting list			0
' this may lead to patients occupying acute care beds when no longer in need of acute care services			2
