' we ca n't pretend that 2014 has been a good year ' said @entity10 after @entity11 ended the year in defeat			2
' we want to look forward with optimism but we can not be happy with the way we played at the @entity15			2
' it was fitting that @entity11 lost their last game of the year to the team that replaced them as @entity21 ; although it seemed for most of the match that neither side would break the deadlock			2

referee : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) @entity11 started with just four of the players that helped them win the @entity15 four years ago and @entity27 fielded only three of their starters from the victory over @entity107 in the @entity108 in july			1
the host 's first real chance came on 11 minutes when @entity111 forward nolito almost scored on his debut in his home stadium			0
he let - fly from distance only for former @entity117 keeper @entity81 to turn the shot around the post			0
the @entity121 goalkeeper had gone on loan at @entity117 and played two games for the @entity124 in the 2008 - 09 season			0
@entity11 were playing the better football with @entity72 pulling the strings against @entity1 team - mates @entity0 and @entity87			1
with three @entity1 midfielders on the pitch and the driving rain making for rapidly deteriorating playing conditions coach @entity132 will have had a nervous eye on the match having lost @entity136 for three months when he injured a tendon in his thigh against @entity139 at the weekend			0
when the injury scare came it was for @entity27 manager @entity142 and for @entity144 coach @entity143 as @entity34 was taken off after 23 minutes with a bruised back			1
his last contribution was to play a part in the best move of the first half			0
it was the first glimpse of the kind of football that wins @entity152 from @entity27 as @entity0 , @entity34 and @entity52 combined brilliantly			1
@entity61 – playing his 160th game for @entity11 – got down well to make the save			0
@entity10 took off three of his @entity15 winners at half time with @entity59 , @entity57 and @entity43 all replaced and then brought on @entity62 in goal for the last 15 minutes			2
his brief debut turned sour as @entity0 showed his class with two minutes left scoring from distance to give @entity27 the win			1
@entity45 nips in to dispossess @entity11 midfielder @entity67 as the ball rolls out of play for a throw - in @entity11 midfielder @entity67 ( centre ) gets the better of @entity27 's @entity84 in the air as the pair battle for possession @entity27 substitute @entity40 attempts to steer the ball away from @entity11 frontman @entity73 @entity11 defender @entity59 reacts to a miss chance and bites his red shirt during tuesday 's clash between the two football heavyweights @entity87 fails to get the better of his @entity176 @entity1 team - mate @entity72 in the middle of the park as the rain gets heavier @entity11 defender @entity66 , who moved to @entity27 with @entity144 during the summer , is put under pressure by @entity85 @entity11 forward @entity73 gets in front of @entity27 defender @entity48 to poke the ball goalwards but is denied by @entity91 's boot @entity73 is dispossessed by @entity27 defender @entity82 ( left ) as @entity85 also puts pressure on the frontman			1
