by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 13 november 2012 squeezed into a cattle truck under the watchful gaze of @entity5 soldiers , this haunting photograph captures @entity7 jews being expelled from their homes at the outset of what was to become the deadliest phase of the @entity12			1
part of a collection that has come to light for the first time in around 70 years , the picture is believed to have been taken in 1941 as @entity19 forces established @entity20 in east @entity7 , confining the district 's @entity22 community of around 40,000 into a single , tightly packed area			1
the following year the ghetto was ' liquidated ' as part of @entity27 , and tens of thousands of @entity6 were herded into trucks once more - this time bound for the @entity5 death camp @entity30			1
doomed : the chilling photographs , revealed for the first time in more than 60 years , were taken as the @entity22 occupants of @entity20 were herded on to cattle tracks to be transported to @entity5 death camps the chilling photographs of the resettlement of @entity6 have emerged after owner @entity37 sent them to a local historian in the city last week			1
the pictures were smuggled from @entity42 by mr @entity37 's father , who had worked for the @entity22 @entity44 in the district at the time			2
march 1941 : @entity47 , the district 's governor , proclaimed the establishment of a ghetto in @entity42			2
october 1941 : the @entity5 administration began preparing the eventual expulsion of the @entity53 - apart from the 25,000 working for the @entity54 , the @entity55 , and police			0
early 1942 : @entity20 was divided into two sections , with @entity59 housing unemployed @entity6 and @entity60 the remainder 16 march 1942 : @entity20 was surrounded by @entity55 , many sick and elderly @entity6 were shot in the street later , it was ordered that 1,500 people per day were to be deported ' to the east for work ' 17 march 1942 : the first of @entity42 's @entity6 were deported to the @entity30 extermination camp by 14 april 1942 around 26,000 @entity6 had been sent to their deaths at @entity30 from the ghetto			1
the remainder were sent to the nearby @entity72 where many were killed , and others were sent to the @entity75 death camp			0
the proximity of the photographer to the subjects in the chilling images has led historians to conclude they were taken by @entity19 troops			0
historian @entity82 said : ' we received a collection of five images that are likely to have been taken between 10 and 13 march 1941 at the time the @entity19 were carrying out their expulsion of @entity6 from the jewish quarter			1
' they wanted to create a ghetto and rid @entity42 of the @entity6 , which they did on march 24 , 1941			1
' we know that they are from before the liquidation of the ghetto in 1942 because that happened at night time , so these clearly are n’t from then , ' the historian said			0
' also , you can see that the @entity6 are clearly being prepared for deportation as they have the remains of their belongings with them			0
' i think the photos were probably taken by other @entity19 , because of the proximity of the photographer to the soldiers			0
' it seems that some of the @entity19 are posing and smiling - they seem quite at ease , ' said mr @entity82			0
' and it ’s interesting to note that two of the photos show @entity6 posing			0
my guess is that these were to be used as propaganda			0
' @entity20 was one of at least 1,000 established in @entity19 - occupied and annexed @entity7 and the @entity112 alone			1
in 1942 , @entity20 became one of the first to be liquidated by the @entity114 , with the majority of its prisoners deported to the @entity30 extermination camp between march 17 and april 11 that year			2
@entity22 residents of the ghetto in @entity5 - occupied @entity7 can be seen holding their belongings as they were made to form a line under the watchful eye of @entity19 soldiers the fact that the three elderly men are posing has led historians to conclude the photos were taken by @entity19 soldiers and used for propaganda purposes the remainder were sent to the nearby @entity131 , and were either killed there or sent to the @entity75 death camp			1
of the some 40,000 @entity6 , no more than 300 are thought to have survived the horrors of @entity5 occupation			1
@entity27 was the name given to the @entity5 plan to murder @entity7 @entity6 in the @entity137 area of the country during the @entity139			2
the operation marked the introduction of extermination camps , and saw as many as two million people - almost all @entity6 - sent to @entity30 , @entity144 and @entity145 to be murdered			0
harrowing : ghettos like @entity42 were created by the @entity114 for the purpose of isolating , exploiting , and then eradicating @entity22 populations in territories they occupied death camps : a woman holds a child close to her chest alongside a man laden down with belongings as @entity19 troops herded residents into cattle trucks to deliver them to their deaths at @entity30 or @entity75			2

these images of the doomed occupants of @entity20 in @entity5 - occupied @entity7 are on show for the first time since being taken 70 years *ago*
harrowing photographs were taken in 1941 as @entity19 forces expelled @entity6 from their homes in @entity42 and forced them into a single area of the district
between 17 march and 14 april 1942 , tens of thousands of @entity6 were transported from the ghetto to @entity5 *concentration* camps
less than 300 @entity6 are believed to have survived the horrors of @entity5 occupation
