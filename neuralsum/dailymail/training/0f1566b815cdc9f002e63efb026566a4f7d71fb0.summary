the curse of @entity1 is said to have claimed more than 20 lives			2
by contrast , the curse of @entity4 amounts to little more than an occasional inconvenience for museum curators			0
over several days , the ten - inch @entity9 statuette gradually rotates to face the rear of the locked glass cabinet in which it is displayed , and has to be turned around again by hand			1
those who like tales of haunted pyramids and walking mummies may regard the mystery of the 4,000 - year - old relic – an offering to @entity20 , god of the dead – as the strangest thing to hit @entity23 in decades			1
whatever the solution , the puzzle certainly wo n’t dent visitor numbers at its present home , @entity27			0
the statuette ’s slow about - turn has been captured on film by a time - lapse camera , and curator @entity25 , 29 , says he believes there may be a spiritual explanation			1
‘ i noticed one day that it had turned around , ’ he said			0
‘ i thought it was strange because it is in a case and i am the only one who has a key			0
‘ i put it back , but then the next day it had moved again			0
the 10 - inch tall relic , which dates back to 1800 @entity51 , has been at the museum for 80 years but curators say it has recently starting rotating 180 degrees during the day ‘ in @entity9 they believed that if the mummy is destroyed then the statuette can act as an alternative vessel for the spirit			1
maybe that is what is causing the movement			0
’ the statue , made by one @entity4 in about @entity61 , was donated to the museum in 1933 , and had been reassuringly immobile for most of that time			1
however mr @entity25 and his colleagues are now used to finding it facing the rear of its case – perhaps significantly , displaying a prayer on the back requesting ‘ bread , beer , oxen and fowl ’			0
experts decided to monitor the room on time - lapse video and were astonished to see it clearly show the statuette spinning 180 degrees - with nobody going near it in this time lapsed video , as the museum closes for the evening , the statue can be seen in a clearly different position by midday the next day it has turned almost a quarter of a circle to be facing to the left the following morning the statue has moved again , and is facing even further away from its original position by the end of the day the statue has turned almost 180 degrees and is now facing away from visitors to the museum their video has recorded it rotating to its left over the course of three days until facing backwards			1
even more mysteriously , it appears to spin only during daylight hours , and does not turn beyond 180 degrees			1
some , including professor @entity29 , have suggested that vibrations caused by the footsteps of passing visitors makes the statuette turn on its glass shelf			2
mr @entity25 said : ‘ @entity29 thinks it ’s “ differential friction ” where two surfaces , the stone of the statuette and glass shelf it is on , cause a subtle vibration which is making the statuette turn			2
but it has been on those surfaces since we have had it and it has never moved before			0
‘ and why would it go a round in a perfect circle ? it would be great if someone could solve the mystery			2

10 - inch tall relic is an offering to @entity9 @entity20 , @entity126 of the dead
it has been filmed on a time lapse , *seemingly* spinning 180 degrees
tv physicist @entity29 among the experts being *consulted* on mystery
but some now believe there could be ' spiritual explanation ' for turning statue
