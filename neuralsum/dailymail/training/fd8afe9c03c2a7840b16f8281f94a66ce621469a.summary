by @entity0 bookmaker @entity1 is gloating after its ' disgusting ' @entity3 advert has now become the most complained about advert of all time			1
many of the record 5,525 complaints put to the @entity8 were concerned the advert trivialised issues surrounding a murder trial , the death of a woman and also disability			1
but when the @entity16 contacted @entity17 for a statement about the distress the advert had caused it bragged : ' in your face @entity23 ! ' betting giant @entity1 brought advertising into disrepute with its @entity3 ' money off if he walks ' campaign that drew a record 5,525 complaints , the regulator has ruled the @entity31 bookmaker , which is known for cheap pr stunts , is referring to a 2005 @entity23 advert which saw call centre workers singing while eating and drew 1,671 complaints			1
the betting giant 's advert became the most complained - about @entity40 campaign of all time two weeks ago , with thousands objecting to the offer of a refund on all losing bets if the @entity46 paralympian is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend @entity48			1
the advert , which appeared once in @entity50 on sunday , showed an image similar to an @entity53 statuette with the face of @entity3 , next to text stating : ' it 's @entity56			1
money back if he walks			2
we will refund all losing bets on the @entity3 trial if he is found not guilty			1
' this week the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) ruled that the betting giant brought advertising into disrepute with its @entity3 ' money off if he walks ' campaign which drew a record 5,525 complaints			1
the betting giant 's advert became the most complained - about @entity40 campaign of all time two weeks ago , partly fuelled by an online petition objecting to the offer of a refund on all losing bets if he is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend @entity48 the option to put on a bet on the @entity1 website			1
it has now been removed from the site it took the unusual step of ordering that the ad be immediately withdrawn while it investigated the complaints that it trivialised the issues surrounding a murder trial , the death of a woman and also disability			1
others complained that the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence and the @entity8 challenged whether it brought advertising into disrepute			1
@entity1 said that in the context of the high level of media coverage of the trial , it was ' unsurprising ' that complaints had been received			1
however , it ' strongly believed ' that offering a market on a leading news story did not trivialise the issues surrounding the murder trial , death or disability			1
it said the ad was a reflection of public interest , which was perhaps led by the media , and was not a commentary on death , violence or disability			1
and while it accepted that there was a double meaning to ' if he walks ' , it did not go so far as to cause serious or widespread offence , but instead was an inoffensive and relevant play on words - adding that the company supported several sporting events that involved disabled athletes			2

the @entity8 took the unusual step of ordering that the ad be immediately withdrawn while it investigated the complaints that it trivialised the issues surrounding a murder trial , the death of a woman and also disability the @entity50 on sunday said it had taken the decision to publish the ad in good faith and did not intend to cause offence to readers , but regretted that offence had been caused			1
it said it would ensure the concerns raised were taken into account in relevant future decisions			0
the @entity8 acknowledged that the ad made no explicit reference to death or violence			1
but advertising rules stated that references to anyone who was dead must be handled with particular care , saying the ad was likely to be interpreted as making light of the issues surrounding the trial , which included the death of a woman who had been shot by her boyfriend			1
it also considered that the text ' money back if he walks ' and the refund offer was likely to be seen as making light of the serious decision - making process involved in the trial , while references to @entity3 's disability were also likely to cause serious or widespread offence			1
the @entity8 said : ' we acknowledged that the ad had appeared in the context of a high profile murder trial that had received extensive media coverage and was of interest to the public			1
' we considered it would therefore have been reasonable to foresee that serious or widespread offence was likely to be caused by placing an ad that sought commercial advantage based on that trial and which made light of the sensitive issues involved			2
' given the content of the ad , and the prevailing circumstances at the time of its publication , we concluded that it brought advertising into disrepute			1
' the @entity8 ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form , adding : ' we told @entity1 to ensure their future ads did not cause serious or widespread offence and did not bring advertising into disrepute			1
