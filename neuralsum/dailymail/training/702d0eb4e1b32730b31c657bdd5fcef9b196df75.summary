the method , she explains , is designed to add long , lean definition to her female clients and strength and size to her male clients			1
@entity52 said : ' women sometimes shy away from strength training , because they worry it will make them bulk up			1
however my famous 3 - 2 - 1 training method is based on strength training and i always recommend lifting weights to my clients , including @entity0 , @entity61 and most recently @entity62 , and they still look shapely and feminine			1
' he 's got @entity27 to thank for that ! @entity27 has gained a cult following for her 3 - 2 - 1 training method , which includes three cardio segments , two circuit strength training and one core segment , which the likes of @entity20 follow workout buddy : @entity27 , who works with @entity20 , emphasises the importance of training smarter not longer			1
she says working hard for 30 - 45 minutes is better than exercising for longer periods ( anything over and hour ) and risking overtraining @entity27 shared her step - by - guide to achieving a celebrity body in a few simple steps			1
it all starts with pre-workout fuel and , she says , if you are n't eating the right foods before you hit the gym , you may be sabotaging your workouts			1
' eating the right foods at the right times will make a difference in the way you gain muscle tissue , ' she says			1
' make sure you have a snack pre-workout such as rolled oats , eggs and toast , or if on the go , a handful of almonds or a protein shake like everything but the cow - it is a blend of soya protein and real fruit and will give you the energy you need to work hard			1
' giving your body what it needs includes restoring a natural balance			2
training hard produces stress which in turn , creates free radicals which attack healthy tissue in the body			1
to help your body fight these free radicals , ensure you have a healthy intake of fruit and vegetables each day such as broccoli , berries and cherries			2
' a-list clients : @entity27 , pictured , left , with @entity18 and , right , with @entity1 , believes that women should lift weights , as daunting as it may be helping @entity127 : @entity27 says miss @entity61 has learned to control her diabetes by limiting her carbohydrates to ones that do not cause a rapid rise in sugar levels , which also has the added benefit of weight control @entity27 says there are no excuses for not working out and if you suddenly find yourself away from a gym , then do n’t skip a workout just because you do n’t have any equipment			1
' try combinations that include single - legged squats , single - arm pushups , walking squats and sit - ups			2
a full - body workout can get you the sweat you need in 10 minutes , ' she said			2
she also emphasises the importance of training smarter not longer			1
' if you are one of those people that believes they need to spend as much as ten hours a day in the gym then i have news for you : it is better to train in an efficient effective manner at an intensity level that challenges you , say 30 - 45 minutes than exercising for longer periods ( anything over and hour ) and risking overtraining			2
overtraining can break down muscle tissue and can even lead to injury over time , ' she said			2
she also believes that women should lift weights , as daunting as it may be			2
' i often see ladies in the gym not lifting enough weight			2
they are afraid of bulking up , but if not enough weight is lifted then not enough stress is put on the muscle to make a change , ' she said			2
' women do n’t need to worry about bulking up ; hormonally women do n’t have enough testosterone to look like men			2
@entity61 , @entity0 and @entity2 and all lift weights and none look bulky but instead are enviably toned			1
' and while most of us use the scales to track our progress , @entity27 says that number tells only half the story			2
' our body composition reveals ratio of fat to lean muscle tissue and while muscle weighs more than fat , it looks better on a body and it burns calories even while we sleep , so step away from the scales and trust how you feel in your clothes and in yourself			0
' @entity27 also emphasises the important of rest and recovery - a time to rebuild muscle tissue and recharge energy supplies			0
she advises her clients to train three days on and one day off			0
it sure works ! @entity27 's method , she explains , is designed to add long lead definition to her female clients and strength and size to her male clients speaking about working with @entity0 , @entity52 said : ' i can tell you that she ’s just like everyone else			1
@entity0 has had to work at it by exercising and eating right			1
' what @entity219 understands is the 80/20 rule			1
while it ’s fun to occasionally go for fancy diners , have dessert and a glass of wine , it ’s equally important to prepare most of your meals during the week			0
' @entity0 has always enjoyed cooking			1
she knows that by doing so she can control what goes into her food			0
she eats plenty of fruits and vegetables and enjoys most dishes			0
@entity0 eats only until she is full then puts the fork down			1
' once you are able to eat in moderation , use portion control and make consistent healthy choices most of the time			0
' when it comes to food , @entity27 also believes that you should limit your carbohydrates to whole fruit , whole vegetable , whole grain breads , muffins , bagels , rolls , pasta , noodles , crackers , cereal , and brown rice and quinoa			0
' @entity61 has learned to control her diabetes by limiting her carbohydrates to ones that do not cause a rapid rise in sugar levels , this has had the added benefit of weight control ' , ' she said			1
