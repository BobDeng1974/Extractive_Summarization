now i know i ought to retain my grown - up poise and sophistication at all times , but it 's christmas ! i get thoroughly over-excited as the festive season gets into full swing			1
it 's a stunning party face , which is why just about every celebrity out there regularly works this look			1
and , hey , if it 's good enough for @entity30 , it 's definitely good enough for @entity31 ! the base for this look you want a fresh , dewy base as the overall finish is glamorous and glistening			2
i used @entity38 , which you can apply with a brush or with your fingers			0
i love the healthy , radiant finish it gives the skin			0
i also applied a bit of @entity45 under my eyes for a little extra coverage			0
it 's easy to get a little tired during party season , which can lead to the odd blemish			1
this concealer gives full coverage without ever looking thick or caked			1
now set everything in place with a dusting of translucent powder - i used @entity57 and @entity58 , which is super-lightweight and has tiny just a hint of shimmer to create a really glowing complexion			1
the eyes start by taking @entity64 in the soundtrack and sweeping the champagne shade all over your lids to act as a base colour			0
now it ’s time to get glitzy so blend @entity71 in @entity72 all over your eyelids			0
this is a really stunning sparkly gold shade - just perfect for party eyes - and it 's richly pigmented , so a little goes a long way			1
however , you really want to pack on the colour for this nighttime look , so apply several shimmering layers			0
sparkly eyeshadow and glitters can be messy to use , so i dab a little bit of the product onto the back of my hand then sweep it on with a fluffy brush			0
@entity18 suggests using a cream bronzer for a fresh - faced finish a fine black eye liner goes beautifully with glitzy eye make - up like this and really makes the colour pop. i lined my upper lash line with the @entity98 , gently stretching my eyelid and applying the pen as close to my lash line as possible			1
the finish you 're after is a neat , slim line rather than a thick 60s flick - keep it elegant			1
no party look is complete without lashings of mascara - i used @entity109 on my top and bottom lashes , wiggling the brush all the way up from the root to spearhead lashes and avoid clumping			1
finally , fill in your brows with @entity38 ' @entity119			0
if you ’re going for a bold lip , groomed brows are a must			2
the @entity123 to go with the dewy base , i recommend a cream bronzer to achieve a fresh - faced finish			2
i used @entity127 , which gives a gorgeous shimmering sunkissed finish and is easy to apply – just dab it under your cheekbones and blend in your fingers			0
next i added a touch of @entity132 along the tops of my cheekbones , giving them a glistening sheen which looks absolutely gorgeous after dark			0
@entity18 recommends using a lightweight powder to provide shimmer without make - up looking too caked on the lips now for the fabulous festive pout ! red lips are a party classic and always make me feel super sexy			1
i used @entity145 in @entity146 , a deep crimson shade			0
for long - lasting lippy , apply a coat straight from the tube then blot with tissue before applying a second layer			2
you can get the products i used to create my festive party look on @entity155			2
now where 's that mistletoe ? i 'm ready for some @entity13 kissing ... mwah , mwah ! on another very exciting note , this week it was revealed that the hugely - hyped @entity162 pharmacy favourite , @entity163 , is launching in the @entity164 for the first time ever – exclusive to @entity155 ! the @entity167 spray - on toner is superb for improving oily and blemish - prone skin , and has received rave reviews from dermatologists , beauty journalists and bloggers worldwide			1
it ’s released on january 1 , but you can pre-order it on @entity176 here from now ! i ’m going to be doing a full review of this skincare staple very soon , so keep your eyes peeled			0
