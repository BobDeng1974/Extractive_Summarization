at the weekend mr @entity1 refused to commit to an in / out vote , claiming it would be bad for the country			1
but a group led by former @entity3 minister @entity13 has launched a campaign to convince him otherwise			1
divided : labour leader @entity1 is now facing a rift in his party after he refused to commit to holding an in / out referendum so the @entity19 people could have their say on whether they wanted to remain part of the @entity8 yesterday the shadow chancellor @entity22 warned that the @entity27 should not ‘ set our face against consulting the @entity19 people ’ – but added that now was not the time to announce a change of heart			1
mr @entity22 , who is said to be pushing for a commitment to an @entity8 referendum in @entity5 ’s next manifesto , said he thought the party should ‘ acknowledge the deep concerns in the country ’ over the subject			1
the rift emerged after mr @entity1 gloated at the weekend that the @entity36 are ‘ hopelessly divided ’ on @entity3			1
mr @entity13 , chairman of the @entity37 , said : ‘ i believe that it is the democratic right of the people to make that decision [ @entity8 membership ] for themselves			2
’ former @entity3 minister @entity13 is leading a campaign calling for a referendum to be held on @entity19 's membership of the @entity8 the leader of the @entity5 for a @entity48 campaign , party donor @entity45 , said : ‘ we all want to see prime minister @entity1 in 2015 and the best way to ensure that happens is by telling the people we too will give them a say on the @entity8			1

’ mr @entity22 told @entity80 ’s @entity79 programme that the party would have to address the issue , but added it would be wrong to do so now			2
‘ i think we have to acknowledge the deep concerns in the country at the direction the @entity8 is taking , ’ he said			2
‘ if we give the appearance ... that we ’re burying our head in the sand , we ’re just going to ignore those things , people would say “ they are as out of touch as @entity95 ”			0
’ however , he added that @entity5 should concentrate on @entity8 reform first , stating : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s sensible , it ’s not wise , it ’s not balanced and it ’s not statesmanlike for political parties , for their short - term political advantage , to start making claims about referendums when we do n’t even know where we are going to be			0
’ nonetheless , he stressed : ‘ i do n’t think we should set our face against consulting the @entity19 people			0
‘ but i think if we were to start answering your question by saying “ well , maybe in two years ’ time ... ” we play the same destabilising , political , tactical , short - term game which is actually making @entity95 look like he ’s not really fit to be prime minister at the moment			0
