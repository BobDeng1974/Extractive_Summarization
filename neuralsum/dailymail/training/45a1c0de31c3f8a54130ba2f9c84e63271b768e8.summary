‘ seriously , i ’m the same guy who left @entity8 but at the same time i ’ve grown so much – apart from the washing machine			1
i ’ve learnt to face things alone and look after myself			0
no matter what happens , this will really help me in my life , not just in my career			0

the most amazing thing i realise from watching @entity32 is that even though she ’s a star , the most important thing is her family			0
‘ she ’s so humble and such a lovely person with everyone			2
even if you are successful you have to be humble and work hard and be nice to everyone			0

‘ what will be , will be , ’ he says			2
‘ i just want someone who makes me laugh , someone who takes things easy and does n’t stress			2

@entity0 showing his quirky style in yellow trainers ( left ) and in a tuxedo and trainers ( right ) how did that feel ? ‘ i was very happy , ’ he says			1
‘ when you see someone crying for you when you are singing – it ’s so beautiful – you did something good and touched their heart			2
i do n’t just want to be a singer with a good voice i want to give emotion			0
’ despite rumours that the @entity4 men were told to watch their figures , @entity0 says his new obsession is @entity118			1
‘ i ’m not on a diet and i do n’t want to be on a diet			0
we all try and stay healthy in the house because we have such a busy schedule – but sometimes i just need some chocolate			0
‘ but chocolate is healthy – because it makes you smile – and that ’s healthy ! right ? ' spice up your life : things then took a fun turn as the @entity8 was joined the ‘ @entity131 ’ in @entity72 during the first two live shows , it seemed @entity0 could do no wrong but the tides turned when @entity135 started dishing out the criticism			1
but , @entity0 says , ‘ i ’ve always appreciated the fact that he ’s been fair			1
‘ being honest he made me realise the things i ’ve had to change			2
and in the last two weeks i ’ve received amazing comments from him			0
’ but it ’s no longer @entity135 whom @entity0 has to please			1
his fate now lies in the hands of the @entity4 audience , whose votes alone will decide the winner of the live final this saturday			0
