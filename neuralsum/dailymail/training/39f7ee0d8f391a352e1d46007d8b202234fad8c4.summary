by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 29 august 2013 vets have found a novel way of treating an albino alligator who suffers from back and leg problems			1
@entity7 was born eight years ago with the apparently incurable ailments of hunchback and scoliosis - but he is now receiving acupuncture at the @entity12 , where he has lived since 2007			1
once a week , several needles are inserted into @entity7 's back - and the treatment is working			1
he is already able to twitch his tail again and move his back legs , which until recently he was unable to do			1
veterinarians at the @entity12 in @entity22 decided on the novel treatment for @entity7 , who suffers from hunchback and scoliosis in early 2011 veterinarians at the aquarium in @entity22 decided to see if acupuncture might help @entity7 , as it has with other animals living at the aquarium			1
‘ the acupuncture will ... alleviate his pain and keep all his vital functions going , ’ said @entity31 , a biologist at the aquarium of @entity12			1
he added that the 30 - minute weekly treatments would continue indefinitely , as long as they kept showing solid results			0
acupuncture on animals is becoming increasingly common around the globe , the biologists at the @entity12 aquarium said , especially with pets such as cats , dogs and horses			1
the use of acupuncture on animals began thousands of years ago in @entity47			1
technique : this is a file picture of acupuncture needles in a person 's leg			1
the ancient treatment was first practised in @entity47 around 1,000 years ago , and arrived in @entity54 in the 17th century in the @entity60 , the number of veterinarians who hold membership in the @entity58 of @entity59 has jumped 50 per cent in the last few years to 900 doctors , said @entity62 , the executive director of the academy that is based in @entity64 , @entity65			1
what is acupuncture ? an ancient treatment first practised in @entity47 around 1,000 years ago			1
it arrived in @entity54 in the 17th century , but there has only been strong public interest in it since the 1970s			0
how does it work ? the traditional @entity47 view is that energy - or ' @entity75 ' - flows directly through 12 main channels , called meridians , in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill - health			0
inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at ' trigger points ' restores the flow of energy			0
it is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves , releasing the body 's natural painkillers - endorphins and serotonin - into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are @entity97 is it used to treat ? some people have acupuncture to ' strengthen ' their constitution			2
but it is commonly used for anxiety , asthma , arthritis , depression , high blood pressure , infertility , menstrual problems , migraines , rheumatism , skin conditions and ulcers			0
by @entity113 ‘ there are many zoo veterinarians who use acupuncture , a number of equine practitioners who treat race horses with acupuncture , it 's proven to be a useful treatment , ’ mr @entity62 said			1
‘ it 's common with dogs and it 's becoming increasingly common with cats			2
more veterinarians are seeing the worth of the treatment			2
’ typical ailments treated by acupuncture include neck and back issues , skin problems and pain in general , among other complaints , he added			0
@entity7 requires a few precautions not needed with your average house cat			0
inserting the needles into @entity7 's back requires the important first step of taping shut his lock - tight jaws full of sharp teeth			2
@entity7 wrestles around a bit as the tape is applied , but soon calms down			0
@entity146 then slides behind @entity7 , firmly pressing the needles into his leathery white and yellow hide			0
the needles are inserted along his spine and around the area where the animal developed a hunchback			2
@entity7 does not move at all as nearly a dozen needles go in			0
ms @entity146 gently strokes the side of @entity7 's neck after she applies them all , then waits several minutes before removing them			2
the treatment complete , handlers help @entity7 back into a display pool , his white skin stark against brown fake rocks painted with foliage			0
he moves easily and swishes his tail , gliding along the water as a group of schoolchildren in matching uniforms squeal in delight , faces pressed up against the glass separating them from @entity7 .			0
