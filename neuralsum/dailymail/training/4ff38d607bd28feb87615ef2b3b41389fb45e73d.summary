by @entity0 published : 15:42 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 16:36 est , 16 september 2012 over the course of about two decades , the @entity1 has failed to report hundreds of cases of child sex abuse involving counselors and officials , according to the organization ’s confidential internal files			1
an explosive expose by the @entity9 based on 1,600 documents dating from 1971 to 1991 has revealed that @entity12 officials would often urge admitted molesters to quietly resign and then hide the allegations from the victims ' parents			1
volunteers and employees linked to possible abuse were allowed to leave the organization citing such far - fetched excuses as ' chronic brain dysfunction ' and duties at the @entity24			1
explosive allegations : @entity1 's internal files indicate that the organization failed to report - and in some cases actively covered up - hundreds of cases of child abuse facts about the alleged molestation cases were documented in the @entity1 ' ‘ perversion files ' which the group has used since 1919 to blacklist suspected pedophiles and keep them away from the organization			1
the @entity1 , founded 1910 , is the nation ’s largest youth group with 111,668 units , 2,723,869 young scouts and more than a million adult members			1
in more than 500 cases , @entity1 officials learned about suspected child abuse from children , parents , staffers or anonymous tips , but in 80 per cent of the instances , the allegations were never reported to police			1
in 100 of the cases , officials within the national organization actively covered up the abuse and facilitated the suspected child molesters conceal the truth from the public , according to @entity57			1
in a statement , @entity1 spokesperson @entity59 said , ' we have always cooperated fully with any request from law enforcement and today require our members to report even suspicion of abuse directly to their local authorities			2
' culture of secrecy : in many of the cases , admitted molesters were allowed to resign citing bogus excuses secret files : more than 1,600 instances of alleged child abuse were laid out in @entity1 's internal documents known since 1919 as the ' perversion files ' the organization put that requirement in place only 2010			1
prior to that , the official modus operandi was to obey state laws , which did not always require youth groups to report abuse			0
in many cases , officials said they were keeping allegations under wraps so as to protect the young victims			0
as a result , some of the suspected pedophiles went undetected for years and continued molesting children , according to documents and court records			0
one case in point involved assistant troop leader @entity98 , who was caught in 1971 engaging in oral sex with a 12 - year - old behind a tent at a @entity103 camp			0
' mr. @entity98 made me do it to him , ' the young @entity104 told officials , according to the file			0
face of evil : assistant troop leader @entity98 was caught in 1971 engaging in oral sex with a 12 - year - old at a @entity103 camp , but he was not reported to police @entity98 ' admitted his role in the act ' and said he 'd never done it before			0
he was ousted from the youth organization and told to stay away from the boy , but nothing indicates that the incident was reported to the police			0
the records show that the teenage victim was counseled ' with positive results ' by the rev. @entity126 , the camp 's @entity127 chaplain , who later ended up in the ' perversion files ' himself after a man told officials that he and his bother were raped by the cleric as young boys			1
in 2002 , the @entity134 paid $ 13.5million to 36 victims who sued @entity126 and 10 other priests over sexual abuse going back to at least 1975			0
meanwhile , @entity98 was convicted of sexual assault in 1997 and possession of child pornography in 2005			0
in another case from the 1970s , a @entity142 scoutmaster who was accused of two rapes and other sex crimes abruptly stepped down , writing in his resignation letter that he had to travel more for work			0
‘ good luck to you in your new position , ’ a top troop representative wrote back			0
he said he was accepting the resignation ‘ with extreme regret			0
' those accused of abuse got a form letter from the @entity1 that read in part , ‘ we are making no accusations and will not release this information to anyone , so our action in no way will affect your standing in the community			2
’ @entity1 attorneys have long been fighting in court to keep the ‘ perversion files ’ secret , citing the importance of protecting the victims ’ privacy			1
however , over the years , hundreds of internal files have been admitted into evidence in lawsuits brought by alleged victims , and hundreds more are expected to see the light of day in the near future			2
widespread : the @entity1 is the nation 's largest youth organization with over 111,000 units and nearly 2,724,000 young members in june , the @entity183 ordered the release of 1,247 of the @entity1 ' confidential files covering two decades beginning in 1965			1
the files played a key role in a 2010 court case that resulted in a nearly $ 20million judgment against the @entity1			2
although the youth group has made strides to curtail sex abuse , instituting mandatory background checks for all volunteers in 2008 and perfecting child abuse prevention training , @entity1 may yet face a slew of costly lawsuits for failing to report past crimes , or even in many cases notify the victims ’ parents about the allegations .			2

1,600 confidential files cover time period from 1971 to 1991
' perversion files ' have been used since 1919 to blacklist suspected molesters
one alleged pedophile was allowed to resign citing ' chronic brain dysfunction '
