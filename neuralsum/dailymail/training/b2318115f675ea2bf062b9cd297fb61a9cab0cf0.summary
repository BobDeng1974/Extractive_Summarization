a couple who claimed single parent allowances			1
these kind of family support payments are the most rorted welfare payment , according to the @entity14 treasurer @entity39 warned , when handing down his first @entity40 , that the government ' can not maintain current levels of expenditure ' - making it more important than ever to crack down on those defrauding @entity45			1
with the help of new technology , @entity47 workers are starting to catch these rorters on camera			0
