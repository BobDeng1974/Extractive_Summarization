the annual battle to be top of the @entity1 came down to a fight between the bawdy @entity3 and the traditional @entity4			1

the pre-recorded broadcast , shown on @entity13 and @entity14 , secured a combined audience of 7.8million , an increase of 90,000 from last @entity1			0
the @entity18 's speech ( pictured ) has been the surprise hit of christmas day after it won the tv ratings way to become the most watched television programme yesterday it was the one bright spot for broadcasters as more and more viewers either shunned a lacklustre array of programmes or decided to watch online , on iplayer or on delayed channels , according to the @entity29			1
the @entity18 chose reconciliation as her theme for the 15 - minute broadcast , mentioning her @entity34 visit , the @entity36 referendum and the centenary of the @entity38			2
speculation that she would abdicate during the broadcast had led bookmakers to stop taking bets on the issue			0
mrs @entity3 , a raucous sitcom about an @entity47 family that was last year ’s most - watched @entity48 programme , won 7.6million viewers this time around – a fall of 1.8million			1

the rise of online streaming services such as @entity91 , on - demand viewing and catch - up iplayer services provided by the @entity13 and @entity14 mean many no longer watch a programme when it is initially broadcast			0
