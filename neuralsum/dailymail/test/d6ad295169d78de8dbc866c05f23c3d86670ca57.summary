@entity0 will not be forced out of @entity1 , but the club are set to make the midfielder available this summer			1
@entity4 revealed earlier this week that the @entity6 champions will listen to offers for the @entity8 as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season			1
but @entity0 will fight for his @entity1 career this summer despite the club pondering his future			2
@entity0 will not be forced out of @entity1 , but the club are set to make him available this summer @entity4 revealed earlier this week that the @entity6 champions will listen to offers for the @entity8 he is said to be content with life at the @entity17 despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave			1
the @entity8 has played a major role during @entity1 's recent trophy - laden period , helping the club to two @entity6 titles , an @entity25 and @entity26 since joining from @entity27 in 2010			2
and the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for @entity1 in the future and remains fully committed to the cause			0
another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four - time @entity36 winner 's wages			1
@entity37 , managed by @entity38 , are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts @entity0 has more than two years left on his current £ 220,000 - a - week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less			1
a number of clubs , such as @entity37 , are interested in the 31 - year - old , but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it			2
@entity37 are prepared to offer @entity0 a five - year deal to compensate for the pay - cut he would be required to take if he moved to @entity54 — although , it remains to be seen whether he 'd agree to such a compromise			1
there have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for @entity59 — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots			0
but it seems the club are now happy for him to leave			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , will resist any attempt by @entity67 to pull out of a £ 24million deal for @entity69 to fund a move for @entity71 , currently on loan at @entity73			1
@entity1 will resist any attempt by @entity67 to pull out of a £ 24million deal for @entity69 this summer @entity69 joined @entity67 on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the @entity80			1
reports in @entity82 suggested that @entity67 are having second thoughts about keeping @entity69 next season , but @entity1 are adamant that the deal will go through as planned			2
the 29 - year - old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the @entity17 following a £ 20.6m move from @entity90 , but he has only found the net five times for @entity67			2
when he scored in monday ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity94 , the @entity82 striker refused to celebrate , fuelling speculation over his future at the club			0
@entity69 joined @entity67 on loan last summer but reports in @entity82 say they are looking at @entity71 @entity99 kept @entity67 in fourth place in @entity101 and on course to qualify for the @entity103 , but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender @entity106			0
it has , however , not stopped @entity67 being linked with a summer move for @entity71 , who is set to leave @entity73 at the end of his season - long loan from @entity111			0
@entity71 ’s agent @entity112 has been acting as an advisor to @entity67 owner @entity114 and offloading @entity69 is seen as one way of affording the @entity117 star			0
@entity1 had scouts at @entity119 , watching their 3 - 1 @entity103 win over @entity121 on wednesday night , with the home team ’s @entity123 left - back @entity122 said to be the main focus of interest			0
