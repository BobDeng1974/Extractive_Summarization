more than 100 dogs are trapped in ' disgusting , inhumane ' squalor at a puppy breeding farm in north - western @entity3 , despite notifications to the @entity6 and local authorities , says an animal rights group			1
@entity8 , founder of @entity10 - based organisation @entity9 , says she was ‘ horrified ’ to find a heavily pregnant labrador , lying dead on the cold concrete floor of a shed at the rural property near @entity14 recently			1
‘ usually when i go into these places , i shut down emotionally because i just have to get the photos , ’ @entity8 told @entity15			2
‘ this time i was caught out : i just sat there with her and patted her for half an hour , it was so sad			2
the worst part is that her death was preventable			0
’ ms @entity8 , who has been rescuing dogs from ' puppy factories ' for more than 20 years , travelled to the property this week to photograph the abuse after she was tipped off by members of the community			1
she has made several trips to the farm since january and says she reported what she saw to the @entity6 numerous times			2
‘ we 've been complaining about this farm for more than a year now and the authorities have ignored us , ’ she told @entity15			1
‘ this time i had to go public			2
' there are no immediate concerns for their welfare , ' he said			0
but the owner of the puppy farm , @entity56 , has been known to authorities for over a year			1
in december , the @entity6 raided the property and charged @entity59 with aggravated animal cruelty and failure to provide veterinary care			1
she was made to relinquish 27 dogs , fined $ 11,500 and was placed on a 12 - month good behaviour bond , @entity47 reported			2
@entity8 says the ' puppy factory ' should have been shut down			0
' this case proves that the system we have can not properly safeguard animals , ' she said			0
' a fine to a puppy farmer is nothing more than the lost sale of one or two puppies to a pet shop			2
' @entity8 says there are currently about 130 dogs at the property who are living and giving birth in ' filthy , filthy conditions ' and at least 10 dogs that require immediate veterinary care			1
‘ there is one dog i 'm especially concerned about : a labrador that is never let out of her enclosure , she is only being fed every other day , at most , and she is so lame she struggles to walk			2
she has a number of mammary tumours but it 's her lameness and pain that is so distressing			0
' ' she is so lame she struggles to walk , ' says @entity8 , who travelled to rural @entity3 to photograph animal abuse at the @entity59 property near @entity14			1
a vet report that was leaked to ms @entity8 and used in the @entity6 's case against ms @entity56 last year , described the poor condition of several dogs that had to be put down following the property raid			1
it noted one female terrier who was being attacked by a pack of other dogs			2
' she had an abdominal wound from which her intestines had eviscerated			0
she had multiple puncture wounds over her body and bruising around her eyes			0
her jaw was clamped shut and she had a trickle of fresh blood from her nose , ' the vet had written			0
these puppies were locked with their mother in a ' freezing cold ' shed in the middle of winter @entity8 wants the leadership of @entity119 to change , saying that in all her years investigating puppy farms across @entity121 , she has only ever had poor responses from the @entity3 branch			1
she has called for the resignation of @entity119 ceo @entity125			0
‘ the @entity6 has the highest authority to act to stop animal cruelty			1
we have to take these cases to the @entity6 which is why it ’s so important for people in the position to show strong , compassionate leadership			0
‘ i honestly believe that the reason these dogs have been left behind is because it ’s seen in @entity3 as just too hard and too expensive to relocate and rehabilitate them			1
' @entity8 says the response from some arms of government has also been disheartening			0
she says @entity139 , @entity140 , has emailed her organisation to complain about being ' bombarded ' with hundreds of rude emails petitioning for action on the factory farming of pets			0
the department is responsible for administering the 1973 @entity147			0
neglected : despite being charged with animal cruelty , property owners have been allowed to continue operating their dog - breeding business when the @entity15 spoke with ms @entity8 , she was on the road taking a car full of rescue dogs that had been seized by council officers from an illegal farm in @entity10			1
she was taking them to a veterinary nurse , and then on to foster care for rehabilitation and behavioural therapy			1
she says she has a ' pretty good ' success rate with her rescue dogs			2
' we work incredibly hard , however long it takes , to get them to learn to be in a house and around people - our vet bill is horrendous ! ' ' these little ones are quite traumatised and they have a long journey ahead of them - but they will be ok			0
' @entity8 says there are hundreds of ' puppy factories ' in @entity121 , some registered but many operating illegally			0
the only way to stop this , she says , is to put an end to the sale of cute puppies in pet shop windows			0
' puppy farms are very much a hidden industry , so the chances of breeders being caught or having a complaint lodged against them is less than small , ' she said			0
' we are lobbying for a full ban on puppies in pet shops			1
pet shops are simply retail outlets for puppy factories that perpetuate abuse			1
' the puppies in the bread basket were huddled together to keep warm in near freezing temperatures in august , with nothing but a filthy , bloodied rag , says @entity8			0
' pet shops are simply retail outlets for puppy factories that perpetuate abuse , ' says animal rights activist some of the dogs locked up at the @entity59 property in @entity3 ' inhumane ' : one of about 130 dogs believed to be locked - up at the @entity59 puppy farm in @entity3 the dead labrador found at the property by @entity8 after she was tipped - off by members of the community @entity8 says most of the dogs she rescues have never been inside a proper home and are fearful of human contact			1
