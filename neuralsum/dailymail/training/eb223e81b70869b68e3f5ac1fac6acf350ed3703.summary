by @entity0 published : 17:42 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 05:23 est , 3 march 2014 there were 11 @entity4 players on the pitch when @entity6 kicked off against @entity7 , and two more came on			1
what a good advert it was for investing in homegrown talent			1
@entity6 had six @entity11 in their starting xi , and @entity13 has four of them in his @entity16 squad			0
@entity17 was the best player on the pitch in the first half and showed great touch and vision , while @entity22 proved why he can be @entity16 ’s left back for years to come			2
as @entity7 took over @entity6 faded but @entity7 ’s @entity4 contingent then came to the fore			1
@entity25 is one of the country ’s best wingers but came on to play at the point of a midfield diamond			0
it shows how much @entity31 works with his young players and improves them			0
@entity33 continues to play well and @entity34 was as reliable as ever			0
@entity7 ’s title challenge rolls on and it was satisfying to see two sides playing good football with a core of @entity4 players			1
when he arrived he was criticised for not winning a major trophy but he has played a strong side throughout , just as @entity57 did in his first season at @entity59 , and now he has one in the bag			1
they might struggle to get through in the @entity62 but who ’s to say they ca n’t go on and win a domestic treble ? maiden : @entity54 won his first piece of silverware as @entity69 boss stunner : @entity71 scored a brilliant goal to equalise at @entity73 it was a good weekend for goals with @entity71 and @entity76 scoring cracking efforts in the cup final			1
but @entity80 ’s first goal was one of the best i ’ve seen in a long time			1
it was an important result too for @entity84			1
they have had some problems playing at home this season — sometimes the players seem to freeze up — but it should be a joy			2
a result like this will get the confidence flowing again			2
brilliant : @entity80 scored a wonder goal against @entity96 we ca n’t be sure of what @entity57 did or did n’t say in the dressing room at @entity100 but one thing is for certain : it worked			1
@entity57 claims he gave his players the silent treatment but @entity105 said his manager had a few words			0
when i was a player i never had a boss that did n’t say anything at half - time			2
there were plenty who would chuck things around — my dad liked to throw a sandwich or two at @entity119 — but it was rarely quiet			0
maybe he has just started a new trend ? whatever he did , it had the desired effect			0
silent treatment : @entity57 did n't say anything at half - time of @entity59 's win at @entity100 improved : drawing 0 - 0 at half - time , @entity59 went on to win 3 - 1 thanks to an @entity105 hat - trick @entity105 is the third @entity132 to score a @entity134 hat - trick after @entity135 and @entity136			1
there has been a lot of talk about @entity59 ’s forwards this season but the club has always had good goalscoring midfielders			1
@entity145 has done it for years , @entity144 gets his share and @entity105 could join them			0
he seemed a bit out of the frame , so i was slightly surprised by his hat - trick , but credit to @entity57 for playing him there			1
@entity105 is so fast and used that pace to get in behind the @entity100 defence			0
he linked up well with @entity144 , no more so than for his first goal , as our graphic below shows			2
opener : @entity105 applied a calm finish to a neat team move for the first goal what @entity165 did was one of the most extraordinary things i ’ve seen in football			1
you can not behave like that and it ’s the last thing you would expect from a manager			0
he is supposed to set the standard and football should do more to try and prevent incidents like this			0
but let ’s not kid ourselves			0
the game has always had tension bubbling just under the surface			2
extraordinary : @entity184 boss @entity165 headbutted @entity186 's @entity185 that is no excuse and @entity165 deserves to be reprimanded but there are short memories in football			1
@entity192 bit a man last year but has been the player of the season so far			0
if it goes well on the pitch your problems can be quickly forgiven			0
@entity184 acted quickly to punish @entity165 so it seems they want to keep him			1
with a ready - made excuse this would have been an easy time to sack him and i feared for @entity165 : it ’s a lot easier to dismiss a manager than it is to get rid of a player worth £ 50m			1
but it looks like the club are standing by their man , for now at least			0
fine : @entity165 was fined £ 100,000 by the club for his actions all credit to @entity218 for the way they beat @entity221			1
they can add that to impressive home wins over @entity59 and @entity225 and a good draw with @entity69 , but it is clear @entity221 are missing @entity228			1
at the start of the season his driving runs and goals took @entity221 to the top of the table and they need him back asap			2
they also miss @entity236 ’s pace , and it was a shame that he was in the studio with me on saturday rather than on the pitch working his magic			0
missing : @entity221 are missing the drive and goals of @entity228 ( below ) sparkling : @entity228 was in brilliant form earlier this season before he was struck down with injury when @entity247 signed @entity248 i thought they had a real player on their hands			1
you do n’t score the goals he did in @entity255 without quality			0
for whatever reason it ’s not quite worked out for him but now he has one i would not be surprised at all if he goes on a scoring run			0
relief : @entity247 striker @entity248 scored his first goal of 2014 @entity263 might be the first @entity132 manager in the @entity134 , but there is one in the championship who has his side flying			2
since taking over @entity269 has nine wins in 14 league games with @entity272 and has taken them from 15th to sixth			0
do n’t be surprised if he is the next @entity132 managing in the top flight			0
struggling : the @entity134 's first @entity132 manager , @entity100 's @entity263 , is still languishing at the bottom flying high : @entity272 boss @entity269 has nine wins in 14 since taking over			2

the game at @entity42 's was a great advert for investing in @entity4 talent
@entity54 won his first silverware at @entity69 - will more follow ?
@entity80 's wonder goal will get @entity84 playing with *renewed* confidence
*schurrle* the next in a long line of goalscoring midfielders for @entity59
@entity221 are *desperate* for the return of @entity228
moment of extraordinary madness could cost @entity165
