leaving an expensive device on a plane usually means waving it goodbye forever			2
but one passenger was shocked when airline staff not only returned his lost @entity5 , but left him a few surprise happy snaps as a souvenir			2
@entity9 , from @entity10 , left the device on the plane after flying with @entity13 to @entity14 in @entity15 three weeks ago			1
it was only upon his return to the @entity30 that @entity9 noticed two extra photographs in the @entity5 image gallery			1
the two cheeky ' selfies ' appear to have been snapped by @entity13 cabin and ground crew			0
in the first shot , two female cabin crew members smile broadly for the shot , one clutching a cup of coffee			0
the second selfie sees two male ground grew wearing @entity44 vests pulling funny faces			0
speaking to @entity46 , @entity9 revealed that he was a few days into his @entity48 hiking trip before noticing his @entity5 was missing			1
i do n't remember taking that : the airline pranksters found the device after the flight from @entity10 to @entity14 and ensured it was safely returned to its owner - but not before taking some happy snaps ' great customer experience ' : @entity9 says he 's just relieved to get the @entity5 back and thinks the crew stunt is ' hilarious ' ' i did n’t realise i lost the device until two days later , when swimming in a hot pot in the middle of nowhere in @entity15 , ' he said			1
' i was kind of in peace with it being gone , but i got faith in humanity and tweeted to @entity13 about it			0
' they got me in touch with the airport police and we resolved that they got my @entity5 when ( i was ) still on the road ! ' i picked my @entity5 up when flying out from @entity14 on another trip to @entity72 , 10 days after i lost it			1
i did n’t find the pictures until getting back home to @entity10			0
' @entity9 , an @entity75 developer , uploaded the humorous images to popular sharing site @entity77 seven days ago			1
the post has gone viral , amassing more than 1.36 million views so far			0
' i immediately realised what happened there and thought it was hilarious , so i put them on @entity77 and the thread exploded , ' @entity9 said			2
' the two guys from the picture actually got in touch with me through @entity77 and @entity88 , so i could even thank them in person			0
' some @entity77 users pointed out that posting the images online could lead to disciplinary action against the @entity13 crew , but @entity9 says that it had not occurred to him - he was just relieved to have his @entity5 returned			1
' i find it amazing and it makes me like @entity13 even more , so i hope no one gets in trouble for this , ' he wrote on @entity77			0
@entity100 : @entity13 promptly returned the @entity5 after @entity9 contacted them , but it is as yet unknown what they make of their employees ' prank ' just to reiterate : this was a great customer experience , i am very happy i got my @entity5 back and i hope no one gets silly and tries to give these nice employees s * * * for it			2
