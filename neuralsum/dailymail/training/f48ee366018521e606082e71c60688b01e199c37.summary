by @entity0 last updated at 9:25 am on 14th february 2012 @entity2 vice president @entity1 will visit the @entity3 this week for crucial talks aimed at strengthening trust before he takes over as leader of the world 's most populous nation later this year			1
@entity1 is due to meet with president @entity9 and other top officials in @entity11 on tuesday			1
he will make a stop in the midwestern state of @entity14 on wednesday to meet local politicians and families with whom he stayed on a 1985 visit while serving as a local official in charge of the pork industry			2
heading over : @entity2 vice president @entity1 waves to @entity23 students during a visit to @entity25 in @entity26 in december			2
he is coming to the @entity3 this week for crucial talks aimed at strengthening trust between the two nations @entity1 , who is scheduled to leave @entity29 later today , finishes the @entity3 leg of his visit in @entity32 for meetings with business leaders and will stop in @entity35 and @entity36 before returning home			0
the @entity3 visit seeks to better acquaint politicians and opinion makers with the man widely expected to begin taking charge later this year of the world 's second largest economy and biggest overseas holder of @entity3 government debt			1
despite their close economic links , @entity2 and the @entity3 remain major rivals in the @entity50 , with @entity11 's traditional alliances competing with @entity2 's economic and cultural influence			1
@entity2 sees the @entity3 as encouraging scepticism and dissent among neighbours in the region while trying to undermine communist rule by encouraging civil liberties and human rights causes			0
meanwhile , the perceived economic threat posed by @entity2 to the @entity3 has also featured prominently in the @entity62 presidential nomination process			0
one aspect of @entity1 's visit will be to gauge public perceptions of @entity2 in the @entity3 and seek ways of overcoming a lack of trust between the sides , a task made more difficult by disputes over trade , @entity73 , human rights and international concerns such as intervening in the ongoing violence in @entity77			2
writing in the official english - language @entity79 newspaper , a collection of well - known @entity2 scholars said ties are dogged by strong @entity2 perceptions that the @entity3 aims to contain @entity29 's growth , particularly as @entity11 carries through a strategic pivot shifting attention and resources back to the @entity50			1
talks : @entity9 is due to meet with @entity1 in @entity11 on tuesday the scholars , who included @entity93 and @entity94 of @entity96 's @entity95 , top advisers to @entity2 president @entity91 , wrote : ' judging from the present situation of @entity2 - @entity3 relations , the strategic mutual trust between the two sides still lags far behind the common interests they actually share			1
' in written responses to questions from the @entity104 , @entity1 highlighted the profitability of @entity3 companies operating in @entity2 , along with @entity29 's efforts to address @entity3 concerns over intellectual property theft and claims that the @entity2 currency is deliberately undervalued to help boost exports			2
but he also made a dig at @entity3 efforts to strengthen its military alliances in @entity50 , saying what @entity3 officials have said are hardline personal views on @entity2 's security and national dignity			1
he said : ' we welcome a constructive role by the @entity3 in promoting peace , stability and prosperity in the region			0
' we also hope that the @entity3 will fully respect and accommodate the major interest and legitimate concerns of @entity50 countries			0
' @entity1 's visit is unlikely to produce major commercial deals , in contrast to earlier trips by @entity2 officials that often featured purchases of @entity3 jetliners and other goods in an effort to ease tension over @entity29 's multibillion - dollar trade surplus			0
on wednesday , @entity2 officials are due to attend the signing in @entity142 , @entity14 , of a purchase agreement for soy beans , the biggest single @entity3 export to @entity2			1
no details of price or size were announced			0
businessmen and trade groups said they knew of no other major deals scheduled to be completed during the visit			0
a spokesman at @entity154 , @entity155 , said he knew of no planned purchases of @entity154 aircraft			0
on tuesday , @entity1 will speak before 600 corporate and policy leaders at a @entity11 lunch organised by the @entity3 - @entity160 and the @entity161 on @entity162			0
in @entity163 , @entity1 is to take part in an investment - promotion event sponsored by @entity2 's @entity166 and the @entity3 @entity167 .			1

@entity169 is widely expected to take over as @entity2 's president later this year
he will meet @entity9 in @entity11 , before moving on to @entity14 and then to @entity32
