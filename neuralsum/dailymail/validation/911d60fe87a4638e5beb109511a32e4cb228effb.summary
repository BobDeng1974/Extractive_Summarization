@entity0 secured the biggest title of her career as she battled back from the brink to beat @entity4 to the @entity5 at @entity5			1
the @entity6 looked down and out on more than one occasion as she struggled with a foot problem and @entity4 gave her an almighty let - off when she passed up the chance to serve for a second @entity5 title			1
but in the end the battling qualities of @entity0 , coupled with the instability of @entity4 who virtually went to pieces as the match went on , got the third seed over the line 2 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4			1
' i want to congratulate @entity4 you were amazing , ' a gracious @entity0 said afterwards			2
' at my age you won this tournament so well done for a great week , a great job and an amazing final			0
@entity0 clinched the @entity5 title with a win over @entity4 in the final ' i am really happy i could win today			1
this tournament has been amazing , i thank all the @entity6 people who come to support me everywhere			0
you make me want to fight until the end			0
' i am really excited to win this , my biggest title , i will never forget it			0
' it had not looked like being a celebration for @entity0 early on as @entity37 dominated			0
she secured the first advantage , taking the last of five break points to come her way in the opening game when @entity0 slapped a forehand long , but she was immediately broken back			2
serve held for two games after that , but @entity4 moved out in front again , turning a 30 - 0 deficit into a second break for 3 - 2			2
that would be the last of @entity0 in the set , as @entity4 served out two games and took another against the serve courtesy of a wild @entity0 forehand to take the set 6 - 2			1
the @entity6 came from behind to win 2 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 in the @entity56 desert on sunday @entity0 paid tribute to her opponent @entity4 after winning the title in @entity5 @entity0 called for the trainer and appeared to have work done to her left foot during the rest , but looked fine as she returned to the court and took the first game of the second , ending a five - game streak against her			1
there was no question that she was in trouble , though , her discomfort obvious and the game her first since wednesday owing to the fact her semi-final with @entity73 was cancelled when the @entity75 pulled out injured			0
but despite being broken early in the set , she hit back by taking @entity4 's serve to love			2
she had little to do as @entity4 imploded , sending a two - hander long and then hitting a short backhand into the net			0
@entity0 drops her racket to celebrate after clinching the match and the title at @entity5 it appeared to be a momentary blip for @entity4 who broke straight back but three double faults when serving to go within a game of the title cost her and @entity0 nailed a backhand winner to level at 4 - 4			1
but the see - saw nature of the match ensured she took the next , again securing a break as she took the second of two points , planting an overhead winner to break down @entity0			0
she had to call coach @entity95 to the chair in the break to calm her down , the pair having an emotional exchange , and tensions were higher at the end of the next game as she was broken again - a fifth game in a row - when she slapped a backhand into the net			0
@entity0 was buzzing now and took the next game , a rare hold of serve , and then broke @entity4 - now the player looking pained - to take it to a decider			2
@entity0 lost the first set 6 - 2 but was able to battle back and win in three in @entity56 @entity4 threw all she had at the @entity6 but came up agonisingly short in a long final @entity4 got the first break of it , a huge slice of fortune falling her way as a backhand clipped the net and dropped over , leaping @entity0 stranded and a break down			1
it was soon 2 - 2 , though , @entity4 raging as the chair umpire mistakenly called game on her serve only to rewind and call second serve , on which @entity0 took a break			1
there was no surprise at all that @entity4 responded by winning on @entity0 's serve , and even fewer raised eyebrows as another break followed , before @entity0 held it together on her own delivery to go 4 - 3 ahead			1
she then broke for what felt the countless time to go 5 - 3 up and on the brink of victory but in keeping with the match she coughed up her serve with a wild backhand before taking the title , fittingly , with a break as she came in short on a forehand and made no mistake .			0

@entity0 beats @entity4 2 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 in @entity5 final
@entity5 was the biggest win of the world no 3 's career
