@entity0 is recalling the december day in 2008 when the unique challenges of offshore sailing came into sharp focus			1
she was racing in the @entity5 , arguably the world ’s toughest endurance event			1
it ’s the solo round - the - world race where @entity9 made her name ; a race where half the boats that start typically do not finish			1
@entity0 was close to @entity13 when she got the emergency call			1
she had been one of the three blondes in @entity18 ’s @entity17 boat , but walked away before the 2004 gold because ‘ i wanted the adventure of offshore sailing ’ — now she was being asked to help a @entity24 rival who had snapped his thigh bone			1
@entity0 of @entity27 looks on as the fleet comes back to the dock early morning after a practice leg @entity0 speaks to media on the dock ahead of the @entity33 - a marathon spanning 38,739 miles ‘ he had been hit by a big wave , suffered this awful injury , and i was one of two boats called by the organisers to help him , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ he was completely rooted to the spot inside the cabin and hundreds of miles from land			2
if he moved he might have severed his femoral artery so he was lying in agony and alone on that boat for about 48 hours			0
‘ he could n’t reach his morphine or any supplies			0
the other boat reached him first and was trying to throw a bag with medicine down the hatch but could n’t			0
transferring him from boat to boat was n’t an option			0
thank god he was in the catchment area for the @entity13 navy , because that is the only reason he is alive			0
’ all this came just days after @entity0 had smashed her elbow and fallen unconscious on deck in the middle of a big ocean			1
she finished fourth that year , the second - best placing for a woman in the race ’s history , but followed it by snapping her mast early in the next edition in 2012			1
‘ the ocean can be a tricky , dangerous place , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ but the fun is in the challenge , right ? ’ @entity0 , from @entity77 , is in @entity78 , @entity79 getting ready for another challenge			1
the 39 - year - old has been named skipper of @entity27 , the first all - female team to enter the @entity33 since 2002			1
it ’s a brutal slog around the world that runs every three years , a marathon spanning 38,739 miles and which represents the pinnacle of offshore racing			1
the first leg starts on october 11 — a 6,487 - mile race to @entity91 — with the cream of the world ’s sailors in opposition			1
team @entity96 : ‘ the ocean can be a tricky , dangerous place			2
but the fun is in the challenge , right ? ’ they race yachts that can travel close to 600 miles in 24 hours , the sailors burning upwards of 5,000 calories a day for three weeks at a time , sustained on a diet of desalinated water and rehydrated powder food			1
the suggestion that sailors cut their toothbrushes in half to save weight is a myth , but it ’s not far off reality			1
‘ my bag has four changes of sailing gear to last a month at sea and my @entity123 , ’ says @entity0 , whose crew includes four other @entity18 women			1
it is a race of attrition and speed , usually won by the team that sustains the least damage to bodies and boat			1
the difficulty is told by the scars of the current fleet			0
a @entity135 skipper , @entity134 , was forced to abandon his sinking boat in 2006 ; the @entity13 @entity137 pulled out in 2009 when he ruptured knee ligaments			2
there is also @entity140 , on @entity134 ’s boat , who broke his back in this event			2
‘ we were told recently that we ’ve each lifted in excess of one million kilos in weights to prepare , ’ @entity0 says			2
‘ the extreme physicality is why women have not been around in the past three editions			0
the boats got more powerful			0
‘ now the rules permit us to carry 11 women whereas a male crew carries eight			2
that ’s three extra brains			2
will it make up the strength and experience gap ? let ’s see			0
we ’ve left no stone unturned			0
if we do well , then hopefully we wo n’t have to wait long until women are back in this race			0
we are going to challenge some perceptions , to show we belong			0
’ to say @entity0 belongs on the water is an understatement			2
@entity27 skipper @entity0 talks with @entity166 ahead of the friday 's practice ahead of the big race her grandfather was a decorated submarine commander in @entity171 , whose @entity172 ’s charm she wears round her neck at sea			1
by the age of three , her family were on voyages in their small yacht to @entity24			0
‘ this race would start in the @entity181 and i went every time , ’ she says			2
‘ i remember @entity183 ’s all - women team in 1989			1
i got a message from @entity183 recently saying i was her daughter ’s hero and that kind of brought home to me what we are about to do			0
’ @entity0 studied engineering at @entity191			2
‘ i was always going off sailing , ’ she says			0
‘ i went away once and got hit by massive storm in the @entity194			0
i had told uni i was ill , but my mum gave the game away by calling them to say we were being rescued by a lifeboat and i was going to miss an exam			0
’ @entity0 ended up as part of @entity204 ’s crew preparing for the @entity205 , one of the original blondes in the boat			1
but rounding buoys was not enough to satisfy her			0
‘ @entity204 gave me an ultimatum because i was always finding an excuse to go offshore , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ i made the decision to leave			0
’ the team went on to gold ; @entity0 joined the tough world of @entity24 solo sailing			1
she made a greater impact in @entity24 than almost any other @entity18 sailor before or since			0
‘ i do n’t regret leaving the @entity17 programme , ’ she says			0
‘ i do n’t think they would have won with me and i need adventure			0
’ that sense has taken her to the @entity33 and a battle of the sexes			2
‘ we are here to compete , ’ she says			0
‘ and like i say , the fun is in the challenge			0
’ @entity27 leader @entity0 speaks during the skippers ' press conference in @entity78 , @entity79 , on friday * * the team is sponsored by @entity27 , the global hygiene and forest products company			1
