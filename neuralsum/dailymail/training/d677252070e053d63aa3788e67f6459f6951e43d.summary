by @entity1 reporter published : 14:11 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 08:50 est , 31 august 2013 a 5,000 - year - old human skull in ' fabulous ' condition has been discovered on the banks of a river in @entity6 by a walker who thought it was a coconut			1
experts said the piece of ancient skull is an ' exceptional find ' as the intricate marks from blood vessels are still visible on the inner surface			1
the smooth dark outer side gives only a tantalising glimpse as to what the person may have looked like , although there are ' tentative ' suggestions it may have belonged to a woman in middle age living in the @entity25 period - around the time @entity26 was built			1
remarkable discovery : @entity28 , senior archaeologist with @entity29 holds the 5,000 - year - old skull which has baffled experts signs : the upper piece of skull 's grey appearance indicated it was from ancient times			1
carbon dating confirmed it is about 5,000 years old the skull is not only prompting questions about the person it belonged to , but where it may have come			1
a dog walker first stumbled across the skull piece , which is about 15cms ( 6ins ) in length and 10cm ( 4ins ) in width , earlier this year but initially thought it was a ball or a coconut shell			1
detectives from @entity49 investigated the scene and contacted experts at @entity29 , who sent the skull to be radiocarbon dated			2
' when i first saw the skull , i thought it may have been @entity58 or @entity59 but i knew that it was not recent due to the colour , ' said @entity28 , senior archaeologist			2
' but we were all surprised when the radiocarbon dating put it at between 3,338 @entity66 and 3,035 @entity66 , or about the middle @entity25 period			1
' ' it is so well preserved , it is unthinkable that this had been in the river for any length of time which begs the question as to where it has come from			0
' we know of @entity59 , @entity77 and medieval burials along the river , but this is very rare - it is an exceptional find			1
just the beginning : experts say this find suggests there is an ancient burial site near the site of the skull by the @entity71 in @entity87 ' what it suggests is that we have a @entity25 burial site very near here - we just do n’t know where			1
' he said : ' i do n’t think it was found where the remains were buried , i think we ’ve got a riverside burial and then flooding has brought this down the river			1
the people of the @entity25 , the last part of the @entity103 , were the first farmers in @entity104			0
it was an era of development in human technology when people lived in small tribes			2
spanned from 4,000 - 2,500 bc. @entity25 societies were more hierarchical than hunter - gatherer cultures in general			0
@entity114 brick houses coated with plaster started appearing around this time			0
the growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible			0
doorways were made on the roof , with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses			0
the people cultivated the land , built farmsteads , erected giant stone circles and chambered communal tombs			0
as recently as may 2012 it was discovered that they were responsible for inventing raving			0
in gatherings equivalent to the @entity133 , men of the age would spend several days eating , drinking and dancing			0
herds of cattle were slaughtered to provide food and dancing would continue late into the night during the summer months			0
' finding that burial site though would be like finding a needle in a haystack			1
' mr @entity28 said that without the rest of the skeleton it was difficult to draw conclusions about the person found , and certainly there is no clue as to how they met their death			2
' both myself and a forensic anthropologist believe it is a woman due to the slightness of the skull and the lack of any brow ridges although our conclusions are very tentative because we ’re dealing only with the top of a skull , ' he added			1
' there ’s no trauma to the bone , and where it has broken those are natural breaks , nor is there any sign of disease so we ’ve no idea as to cause of death			0
' the natural fusion of the bone in the skull leads me to believe it may be an older woman , possibly in her 50s , but that is very tentative again			2
' unfortunately , it remains a bit of a mystery			0
' the find is a few miles from @entity183 , which has been a scene of human activity down the ages and still boasts the earthen ramparts of what was an @entity189 hill fort , however finds of @entity25 remains are rare			2
' whenever we come across @entity25 remains , there seems to be a solid dividing line between where they buried their dead , and where they lived and that is no accident , ' he said			0
' but it is frustrating as an archaeologist because although we have the physical evidence , we still do n’t have the answers as to why			0
' the skull is only the second set of @entity25 remains to be found in the county , although two large 6,000 - year - old ‘ halls of the dead ’ were found in nearby @entity208 this year but without any human remains present .			1
