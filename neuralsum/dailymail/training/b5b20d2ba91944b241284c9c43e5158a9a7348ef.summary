by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 19:09 est , 20 february 2013 @entity1 was frustrated by @entity3 voters yesterday as he was dispatched to @entity4 to drum up support for the conservatives			1
the @entity8 mayor toured a suburban cul - de - sac with @entity11 candidate @entity10 - but managed to find only two conservative voters in the area			0
the mood was distinctly frosty as the pair doorstepped more than a dozen homes ahead of next thursday 's by - election in full view of tv cameras			0
campaign trail : @entity1 was in @entity4 today with candidate @entity10 and said their @entity3 rivals were ' a bunch of quivering jellies ' confident : @entity3 leader @entity3 ( centre ) with @entity26 ( right ) , the party 's candidate for @entity4 yesterday one man refusing to shake mr @entity1 's hand saying ' all politicians are corrupt ' , while others said they were not planning to vote or backed the @entity3			1
mr @entity1 let the strain show , muttering ' sodding @entity3 voter ' , as he left one home			2
he admitted this street in @entity4 was ' not the best of it ' but insisted there were ' oodles ' of @entity11 voters elsewhere			2
both @entity42 parties see the @entity44 seat , vacated by the resignation of @entity3 former cabinet minster @entity46 , as a key win			1
happy : the mayor of @entity8 said he was not worried about upsetting the @entity42 with his comments but the @entity50 are behind in the polls in @entity44 greetings : a young girl goes up to shake @entity1 's hand during the pair 's day on the campaign trail mingling : @entity1 visits @entity57 in @entity58 to campaign for ms @entity10 in @entity4 tissue for any issue : @entity1 and @entity11 candidate @entity10 chat to shoppers in an @entity57 car park in @entity4 ahead of the by - election but the by - election campaign has brought out sharp tensions between the governing parties , especially over plans to develop 1400 homes on a local golf course and farmland			1
mr @entity1 said : ' this is classic @entity72 , claiming they want to protect our green spaces whilst doing something else altogether the minute they have even a whiff of power			0
' local @entity3 dems have also seized on remarks by @entity82 that it would be ' impossible ' to educate her gifted son , who hopes to be a surgeon , in a state school			0
but @entity3 , who visited @entity4 on tuesday , is reported to be considering sending his son to Â£ 23,000 - year @entity90 public school , which he attended			2
all smiles : the recent polls did not appear to bother @entity1 and ms @entity10 @entity1 was in @entity4 to say that the @entity3 's party deserved a ' kicking ' although the @entity50 are behind in the polls mr @entity1 said : ' @entity3 's single biggest contribution to @entity96 politics is to execute the most spectacular u-turn anybody has ever seen on tuition fees and sing a song about it			1
' my general view is that he 's a great big quivering jelly of indecision and invertebracy			0
@entity107 is strong ; he has a clear plan for the country			0
' @entity26 - @entity3 - 4/9 @entity111 - @entity110 - 20/1 @entity113 - @entity112 - 16/1 @entity114 - 9/4 mr @entity3 who visited @entity4 earlier in the week , has been criticised for heading abroad for a long week with his wife and sons in @entity117			1
earlier in the day mr @entity1 's team swept through @entity57 supermarket in nearby @entity121 's @entity120 where shoppers were happy to talk , but many lived in neighbouring @entity125 constituency			2
some @entity11 @entity126 expressed dismay at how the campaign had been run saying it had not been focused on local issues and that the @entity3 - who have all 40 local councillors in the constituency as their members - had more activists out on the streets			0
the party claim to have leafleted every home in @entity4			0
but a senior @entity11 working on the campaign said they had plenty of supporters flooding into the @entity44 seat , adding : ' there is great dissatisfaction with @entity46 's behaviour			0
' @entity112 scored a coup yesterday as the party announced former @entity3 mayor of @entity4 @entity147 had defected to the party			1
meeting : the pair have some fun at @entity151 as they prepare for next thursday 's vote - but mr @entity3 is having a holiday beforehand abroad : prime minister @entity107 is shown around the @entity154 at @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 , during the last day of a three day visit to the country today , but is likely to return to @entity4			1

*deputy* prime minister off to @entity117 for a long weekend with his family
@entity4 voters go to the polls on february *28* after @entity46 quit
his party 's candidate is the *favourite* to win , *narrowly* ahead of the @entity50
@entity1 arrives in @entity4 and says @entity3 deserve a ' kicking '
' the @entity3 are *wobbling* jellies of indecision , especially @entity3 ' , he said
