when @entity1 signed his contract with @entity3 , scarcely an eyebrow was raised			1
of course , £ 60million is a massive transfer fee , especially when the attendant salary exceeds £ 5m a year			2
but the young @entity6 said he was desperate to play for @entity3 and we instinctively believed him			1
they are champions of @entity10 , they have a team which reads like a litany of sorcerers and they are , well , they are @entity3			1
and so he walked into a dressing room containing @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 and he hoped to catch the manager ’s eye			1
he is likely to make the starting line - up but his place can not be guaranteed			0
when he has served his well - merited suspension , @entity21 will experience a similar process at @entity25			1
this is the club which , under @entity46 , took its football from the gods and now its standard - bearers include @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
@entity21 has never seemed short of self - belief but even his ego may be daunted by such company			1
like @entity1 , he has no concrete assurance of first - team football			1
@entity59 , whose players formed the framework of @entity64 ’s @entity19 - winning team , are less obviously dazzling than the @entity66 clubs but this enduringly impressive side has added the coveted striker @entity17 to a squad whose strength extends from the world ’s finest goalkeeper @entity71 , through @entity73 and on to @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
so @entity3 , @entity25 and @entity59 are the finest teams in world and @entity79 football and such are their standards that only the very best are invited to join the magic circle			1
hence the recruitment of @entity1 , @entity21 and @entity17			1
all three men want to play at the peak of the game			1
and when they turned their eyes to that peak , not a single @entity89 football club was in sight			2
naturally , finance is a factor since such players and , more pertinently , their agents are never knowingly under - paid			0
but if it were merely a matter of money , then who could bring more to the table than @entity99 at @entity100 , @entity101 at @entity102 or the improbable @entity103 at @entity104 ? no , there are other , less tangible , considerations , and the pursuit of excellence stands high among them			0
there comes a point where even extreme affluence is taken for granted , where status and satisfaction are the motivating factors			0
and currently , such aspirations can not be fulfilled at @entity89 clubs			0
consider the career path of some of those names			0
@entity35 and @entity38 moved from @entity122 , @entity37 , @entity52 and @entity21 left @entity24 and @entity33 departed @entity123			1
@entity124 : if the game was about bringing money to the table , who could bring more than @entity129 at @entity100 ( left ) or @entity101 at @entity102 ( right ) , but other factors define a league 's excellence star : @entity33 is paraded in 2009 in front of a packed @entity135 after his move from @entity123 @entity137 galore : @entity3 are @entity10 's most successful team , winning their tenth @entity139 last season the peak : the likes of @entity50 and @entity51 are likely to be rooted in @entity142 for the majority of their career each man made the requisite noises of gratitude and regret but they did not delay their departures			1
for they now play on stages which deserve their talents and our loss is @entity10 ’s gain			0
in three weeks the @entity23 season will recommence ; some would suggest it never really ceased , others , more impressionable , will be counting down the days			1
@entity161 irrelevances like test cricket and international track and field will be brusquely cast aside , while the delights of @entity166 and @entity167 will be ardently embraced			1
already , the hucksters of @entity169 are babbling breezy promises of ‘ the most eagerly - awaited @entity23 season in years ’ , with ‘ must - see shows ’ in ‘ stunning new studios ’			1
and we prepare for month upon frenzied month of @entity175 , @entity176 and bland platitudes uttered by dull men in sharp suits			0
much of the football will be exciting , some will be enthralling , but all will be presented as the real thing , the genuine article , ‘ the best league in the world ’			2
and we know the claim to be a nonsense			0
only one option : @entity3 and @entity25 are the finest in world and @entity79 football , joined by @entity59 , who recently signed @entity17 ( above ) , a striker who wants to play at the peak of the game competing : the @entity23 had seven @entity139 finalists between 2005 and 2012 we have known it for years but our convictions have been reinforced by the performance of the national team just a few weeks ago in @entity201			1
we may love the sport , for its faults as well as its many virtues			0
but we are tired of being lied to , year after year			0
for what we shall be watching , from late summer through to early spring , is something which falls several steps short of excellence			0
the finest expression of a glorious game is not to be found in these islands			2
outstanding players like @entity21 , @entity35 and @entity33 know the truth of that statement			1
and so , deep down , do we			2
galactico : @entity35 was made the world 's most expensive player in 2013 when he moved to @entity142 reunited : @entity38 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) moved to @entity142 despite interest elsewhere prior and his pals need a reality check as one more chance evaded the gloves of @entity226 last week , a former @entity223 cricketer stared down in bewilderment			1
‘ what ’s he doing out there when he ’s clearly not fit ? ’ , he asked			0
prior himself conceded the point after the @entity233			0
he said he had torn his right quad before the first test of the series , that his right hand had been ‘ beaten to a pulp ’ and that he needed an operation on his achilles			1
‘ i ’m not doing justice to myself and , more importantly , the team ’ , he concluded			0
none of which answered the old cricketer ’s question			0
grounded : prior puts down a regulation chance off @entity249 danger man @entity248 at this point , his most raucous defender said some rather foolish things			0
@entity253 , manager of @entity226 ’s county of @entity255 , first endorsed the admission of unfitness : ‘ he did n’t go in with the best health , ’ he said			1
‘ but @entity226 is a warrior , he is a tough guy and for him to say enough is enough , then he must be hurting ’			1
he then decided to blame the messengers			0
‘ the media have hunted him mercilessly			2
everybody scrutinises every move he makes			0
it almost makes it impossible for him to do his job			0
’ now , the dreaded ‘ media ’ may have all manner of faults but the idea that prior has been mercilessly hunted is simply tosh			2
in truth , there are footballers out there who crave prior ’s trivial level of media scrutiny			1
much more relevant are the fitness questions raised by the player and his hapless advocate			2
why was he playing test cricket with a torn right quad ? why did it take him so long to discover that he was not doing justice to himself or the team ? glum : @entity223 wicketkeeper @entity226 on the balcony at @entity287 's last week and when was it deemed acceptable for an @entity223 wicket - keeper to start a match , knowing that he is not in ‘ the best health ’			1
@entity226 has given @entity223 distinguished service			2
hopefully , he has still more to offer			0
and @entity253 , his devoted admirer , knows precisely what must be done : ‘ he can take stock of himself , do what he needs to do on his @entity298 and get himself ready to properly put his name in the ring , ’ he declared			0
which is surely what he should have done before the series started @entity304 @entity305 , once of @entity24 and now on loan to @entity307 , is a bosom chum of the serial biter @entity21			1
and he is outraged by @entity311 ’s decision to suspend @entity21 from all football activities for four months , along with a nine - match international ban , following his celebrated assault during the @entity19			2
‘ they are treating @entity21 like a murderer and not like a footballer , ’ he protests			2
‘ there are murderers who pay less [ for what they have done ]			0
’ in defence : @entity66 forward @entity305 ( left ) is unveiled after going on loan to @entity307 from @entity24 ousted : @entity21 was given a four - month suspension from all football related activities unlike @entity327 , i have little knowledge of @entity66 penal policy			1
but i have discovered that 242 homicides were recorded in @entity66 last year			0
and of those convicted , not one was sentenced to stay home and keep fit , while continuing to earn £ 200,000 every week			2
@entity335 overwhelming enthusiasm , titanic competition and the glowing satisfaction of a glorious festival ; this sporting nation has seen nothing to compare with the @entity342 of 2012			2
we assumed they would come at a price but we were convinced that price was worth paying			0
now we learn , from a @entity348 report , that the @entity349 have generated a £ 14.2bn boost in trade and investment over the past two years			1
this staggering figure is some £ 3bn ahead of target , in half the projected time			0
new contracts have been won , overseas investment by foreign firms has soared , tourism is up by six per cent , one million people have visited @entity361 and more people than ever before are playing sport			0
@entity364 believed in her @entity342 and the @entity349 are rewarding that faith			2
blossomed : @entity364 believed in the @entity367 in 2012 , and their faith is being rewarded			0

with @entity1 and @entity21 moving to @entity142 , can the @entity23 be considered the best in the world ?
the ' peak ' of a player 's game is now regarded as performing at @entity3 , @entity25 or @entity59
@entity35 and @entity38 moved from @entity122 , @entity37 , @entity52 and @entity21 left @entity24 and @entity33 departed @entity123
television companies feed us hype , but we know deep down the @entity23 is no longer the pinnacle of the game
@entity226 's level of media scrutiny is trivial , but much more relevant is to ask why he was playing test cricket with a torn quad ?
the @entity342 has generated a £ 14.2bn trade boost over two years
