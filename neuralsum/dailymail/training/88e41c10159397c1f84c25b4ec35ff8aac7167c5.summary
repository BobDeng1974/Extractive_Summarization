as @entity0 prepares to take to the court at the @entity2 and attempt to seal qualification for the @entity4 , the @entity6 no 1 features in yet another parody movie poster			1
@entity0 has been mocked up as ' a @entity8 in @entity9 ' in the latest piece of work by designer @entity12 , with @entity13 and @entity14 also making an appearance			1
the poster is a tribute to the 1981 horror comedy film ' @entity19 in @entity20 '			1
the latest instalment of @entity12 's series of posters sees @entity0 , @entity13 and @entity14 feature in a mock - up based on the ' @entity27 ' poster @entity0 , the main man in @entity28 ahead of this year 's @entity29 , was also given the statue treatment earlier this year @entity0 can seal qualification for the @entity4 by reaching the quarter - finals of this week 's @entity2			1
even if he was to lose his opening match , all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season - ending finale in @entity20 : and it may provide some light relief as he looks to continue with the serious business of booking his place in november 's season - ending finale in @entity20			0
@entity0 's comeback from a set down against @entity43 in an enthralling @entity45 final on sunday moved him up to fifth in the qualification standings			0
the @entity6 no 1 only needs to win two matches in @entity9 and reach the quarter - finals to mathematically guarantee qualification			0
but even if he does lose his opening match , it would require an unlikely set of results for him not to qualify for the event on home soil , which begins at the @entity56 on november 9			0
there is plenty at stake in @entity9 with the world no 1 ranking also up for grabs			0
@entity13 can return to the top of the world rankings for the first time in two years if he wins the title and @entity14 fails to reach the final			2
if @entity14 was to suffer a shock defeat before the quarter - finals , then an appearance in the final would also be enough for @entity13 to overtake the @entity70			2
@entity72 3 @entity71 is absent after bringing his season to a close in order to undergo appendix surgery next monday			0
