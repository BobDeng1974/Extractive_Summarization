by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 20:50 est , 6 august 2012 victim : @entity2 died in hospital following a catalogue of errors by medical staff who provided a level of care that was ' inadequate ' and ' simply not acceptable ' , a coroner ruled a coroner last night condemned a hospital after hearing a girl may have died in her bed and then been left by staff for so long she developed rigor mortis			1
@entity17 said it was ‘ simply not acceptable ’ that @entity19 , 59 , should find his 12 - year - old daughter @entity21 stiff and cold to the touch – despite being told by staff she had died minutes before			1
an inquest heard that as well as not being given a blood test , @entity21 had not been monitored in the early hours by nurses , who also failed to take her blood pressure			1
mr @entity17 said the inadequate treatment @entity21 received played a part in her death from septicaemia at @entity30 in @entity31			2
he added : ‘ if the observations had been performed more accurately and the treatment had been instigated at an earlier stage , the likelihood is that @entity21 would have survived			2
’ last night her parents , mr @entity19 and his wife @entity36 , 42 , said they were considering legal action against the hospital			0
they added : ‘ something has to be wrong if this can happen in an @entity41 hospital			0
we insist that lessons are learned for the wider @entity41 as well as @entity44 and that people are held to account			0
‘ @entity21 was a lovely girl who we all loved very much			0
she deserved much better care than what she actually received			0
' no child should be neglected in the way that @entity21 was , let alone a child with a mental handicap like @entity21			0
’ the schoolgirl , who lived with her parents and twin sister @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity31 , was taken to hospital on february 6 , 2011 , suffering from flu - like symptoms			2
but hospital staff failed to diagnose a bacterial infection because they were too busy to carry out basic blood tests and neglected to check on her properly			1
disgusted and appalled : parents @entity63 and @entity36 ( left ) , are to take legal advice after a coroner ruled that their daughter @entity21 , pictured with her twin sister @entity54 ( right ) , would have survived had her care not been so poor the hearing was told how @entity21 ’s blood pressure was never taken as it should have been under hospital policy			1
a team of three nurses failed to monitor her regularly throughout the night – she should have been observed every four hours			0
@entity21 ’s father said that when they arrived at the hospital at 8.30am after being called there by staff , a doctor said : ‘ @entity21 ’s heart has just stopped , she has just died			1
’ but mr @entity19 , who was @entity21 ’s full - time carer , said she was already ‘ stiff as a board ’			0
the coroner told them at the inquest in @entity88 that nurses ’ evidence suggested their daughter could have been dead or dying as early as 4.30am			2
@entity92 , medical director at @entity30 , said : ‘ we acknowledge that the standard of care which we gave @entity21 was not acceptable			1
’ mr @entity17 recorded a narrative verdict			0
failings : staff at @entity99 did not monitor @entity21 properly and skipped important checks ' lovely girl ' : a picture of @entity21 ( left ) and her twin sister @entity54 ( right ) as babies			1

@entity2 died of blood *poisoning* at @entity99 in february 2011
care she received from medical staff was ' inadequate ' and ' simply not acceptable ' , coroner rules
hospital staff failed to monitor @entity21 properly because they were ' busy ' , inquest hears
@entity21 *'s* body was ' ice cold ' when her father saw her , even though staff told him she had only just died
nurse was *suspended* for one month and given a *warning* before *resuming* her *job*
