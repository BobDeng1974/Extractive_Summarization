@entity2 's secret new @entity1 campaign , which features ten very slim , tall models in its new body bra line , came under some serious scrutiny last week			1
the brand faced a backlash amid claims it 's ' body shaming ' and is promoting unrealistic , negative body images by suggesting the ' perfect ' body is tall and slender			0
today , fashion retailer @entity12 spoke out against @entity15 's latest marketing campaign branding it exclusive and misguided			1
in response , @entity12 , a brand that @entity43 designs a range for , has launched a # @entity22 campaign to promote body confidence for all women , of all ages , sizes and shapes			1
they say their campaign includes an image with a crucial point of difference - the models range from a size 10 to size 16 , which they say promotes beauty as a source of confidence			1
the brand hopes that by asking women to share their @entity63 on social media channels they will be inspired to share the things they love about themselves and encourage others to look at their own bodies in a positive light - in a celebration of real beauty			0
original campaign : the @entity15 campaign , promoting the hashtag @entity32 and claiming to provide the perfect fit and comfort , has been accused of using a toxic combination of super slim models and expert airbrushing to create an image of perfection unattainable for most women @entity82 , a spokesperson for the retailer , said : “ we have a responsibility as a retailer to promote positive body image to our customers and that means being representative of women in the @entity92			1
' @entity93 , ceo of eating disorder charity beat , added : ' we are delighted to see @entity12 taking such a positive stance against the negative influence of the " perfect fit "			2
we know perfection does n't come in one size or shape , and how harmful it can be to pretend it does			0
' we know that fashion has what it takes to get real and get in touch with what people want - images that show real health , real beauty and real lives			0
' people have objected so strongly to the @entity15 campaign that a petition has even been fronted by @entity92 students @entity115 , @entity117 and @entity118 via @entity119 , demanding an apology from the @entity122 underwear company			1
petition : people have objected so strongly that a petition has even been fronted by @entity92 students @entity115 , @entity117 and @entity118 via @entity119 - and it has over 20,000 supporters the trio write : ' every day women are bombarded with advertisements aimed at making them feel insecure about their bodies , in the hope that they will spend money on products that will supposedly make them happier and more beautiful			1
' all this does is perpetuate low self - esteem among women who are made to feel that their bodies are inadequate and unattractive because they do not fit into a narrow standard of beauty			0
it contributes to a culture that encourages serious health problems such as negative body image and eating disorders			0
' @entity15 ’s new advertisements play on women 's insecurities , and send out a damaging message by positioning the words ' the @entity1 ' across models who have exactly the same , very slim body type			1
' this marketing campaign is harmful			0
it fails to celebrate the amazing diversity of women ’s bodies by choosing to call only one body type ' perfect '			0
' @entity15 is hugely popular among young women , and they have a crucial responsibility to not use harmful and unhealthy ideas to market their products			2
we would like @entity15 to take responsibility for their irresponsibility			2
' we ’re asking them to change the advertisements and pledge not to use such marketing in the future			0
' the petition now has over 20,000 supporters			2
big brand : @entity15 has an annual show and this december it 's coming to @entity178			2
