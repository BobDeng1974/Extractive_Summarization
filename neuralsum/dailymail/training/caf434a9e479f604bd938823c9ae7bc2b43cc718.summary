@entity0 might have weathered the verbal storm last week but they had no answer here to the muscle of @entity5 as the @entity7 giants took control of @entity9			1
the cash - rich top 14 side had let out their anger off the field at @entity14 last week , but yesterday they vented their rage where it matters			2
their physical firepower proved too much for the @entity0 , who must now set their sights on qualifying as one of the top runners - up			2
@entity0 made too many mistakes and were blown away inside the opening quarter			2
the loss of influential lock @entity26 did not help , as @entity27 exacted revenge for defeat in the reverse fixture with a clinical kicking display , aided by tries from @entity33 and @entity34			1
@entity5 full back @entity27 ( left ) is well tackled by @entity0 scrum half @entity36 ‘ if you ’re inaccurate against @entity5 then you ’re going to get punished , ’ said @entity38 , @entity0 ’s director of rugby			1
‘ we were second best and they deserved to win			0
they were better than us at the breakdown and they were better at the contact point			0
in big games , tiny moments or opportunities make a big difference			0
they ’re a very big team and we struggled to break them down			0
‘ there is only so much you can give physically when you ’re working on a completely different salary scale to the opposition			0
they ’ve got marquee players across the board , have n’t they ? @entity27 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity33 … they ’ve got a marquee player in every position			1
they ’ve got @entity62 and then @entity63 comes off the bench			0
‘ you ca n’t be @entity7 and @entity66 champions when you ’re a poor side			2
’ powerful @entity7 centre @entity33 powers over for @entity5 's second try at @entity70 in this town in the @entity73 , they like to mix their rugby with a splash of drama , whether it ’s the players being marched through a red sea of supporters outside the ground before kick - off , or threats to axe another star			1
comic - book tycoon owner @entity84 loves a good story and last week it was the @entity14 bust - ups involving @entity87 and @entity88 only @entity88 kept his place in the team , shifting to the wing to accommodate the return of @entity27			2
the @entity95 full back ’s role has been limited since his summer move — making just one line break all season but providing a solid defensive unit and taking over kicking duties from @entity101			0
the 25 - year - old showed the composure of his predecessor in the opening exchanges			0
@entity106 winger @entity58 proved a menace down the left and , following his fifth - minute penalty , @entity27 converted @entity34 ’s close - range try to build a 10 - 0 lead in as many minutes			1
@entity112 ( left ) crosses in the corner for @entity0 's sole try during the match @entity0 were caught cold , their play littered with inaccuracies and indiscipline , gifting their hosts two more kickable penalties			1
but in the 28th minute , fly - half @entity121 powered through the @entity5 defence with a piece of individual play that should catch the eye of @entity95 coach @entity127			2
the ball was recycled by @entity36 and went through three pairs of hands to send @entity112 over in the right - hand corner			2
@entity0 went into the break trailing 16 - 5 , fortunate not to be behind by more			0
@entity27 proved he is not quite at the marksman level of @entity101 when he missed his first shot at goal after the break , before @entity88 found himself on the receiving end of a wholehearted shoeing at the breakdown — though the travelling fans offered him little sympathy			0
@entity5 flanker @entity62 ( left ) competes in the air with @entity0 lock @entity143 full back @entity144 showed great awareness to use referee @entity146 as an auxiliary blocker , before racing into @entity5 territory , but @entity149 wasted the chance by cutting inside when he should have pinned his ears back and gone for the line			1
that proved to be a key moment as the hosts hit back at the other end , with @entity7 centre @entity33 dashing in under the posts after fly - half @entity159 was stopped just inches short			1
@entity34 then kicked his first and only penalty of the afternoon for the visitors , but the crowd booed them for being negative and not going for the try			0
the @entity0 struggled to make inroads after that and @entity5 comfortably kept them at arm ’s length to see out the win although they may be frustrated at not securing a bonus point after dominating for long periods			1
@entity5 and @entity106 winger @entity58 ( right ) breaks the tackle of @entity0 fly half @entity121 @entity0 had their chances			1
@entity144 ran a perfect line off @entity177 before the officials failed to award a potentially pivotal line - out after @entity27 had carried the ball into touch five metres from his line			0
@entity38 was fuming in the coaches ’ box and his anger was compounded when @entity5 pulled away with a try under the @entity0 ’ posts as giant centre @entity33 crossed			1
@entity34 responded with a penalty but @entity0 had left themselves with too much to do			1
the introduction from the bench of @entity192 was one positive as @entity194 referee @entity146 continued to frustrate @entity0 with some questionable decisions			0
but ultimately the tourists had no answer to wave after wave of attacks on the @entity201 coast .			0

@entity112 crossed for @entity0 's sole try
