by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 29 march 2013 a father who tried to stop a shop from selling a legal high to his troubled teenage daughter ended up being arrested after losing his temper with staff			1
@entity7 was worried about the health of his 17 - year - old daughter @entity9 after she confessed she had become addicted to the drug @entity11 , which gave her terrifying mood swings			1
so on tuesday he went to the shop where she said she had bought to the drug in an attempt to persuade staff to stop selling the legal high to the underage girl			1
every parent 's nightmare : @entity21 , 17 , is addicted to legal drug @entity11 but when he raised his voice at workers in the shop in @entity27 he was apparently targeted by security guards who forced him to the ground			1
police then attended the scene and arrested the father of three , handing him an on - the - spot fine of £ 40 for shouting at staff			1
mr @entity7 , 62 , said he was horrified to find himself painted in a bad light when he was trying to protect his vulnerable daughter			1
' we 've been trying to find out for a long time what has been the catalyst of her extreme behaviour , ' he said			0
' she told us she had been taking this substance because she was unable to purchase alcohol or cigarettes from local shops because of her age - she only looks about 12			2
arrest : after @entity7 ( right ) filmed @entity9 buying the drug in @entity27 ( left ) he was detained by police ' to prove the point we went to the shop to see if they would sell it to her			1
my daughter 's carer filmed it on her mobile phone			0
' the shop staff never asked for @entity61 and she was just given the product			2
when i started complaining about this , i raised my voice			0
' the next thing i know these two security guards pushed me to the ground			1
' the recruitment executive said the men lay on top of him for 15 minutes while waiting for police to arrive after they had thrown him face - down on the floor			2
' my daughter was going berserk at this point , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' she was terrified - and so was i. ' i could hardly breathe and i thought at one point i was going to die			0
mood swings : the teenager has been behaving increasingly erratically since taking the drug while the exact make - up of the drug sold as ' @entity11 ' is unclear due to its semi-legal status , it appears to be a synthetic cannabinoid similar to the drug ' @entity86 '			1
such substances imitate the effects of marijuana , relaxing users and giving them a ' trippy ' sensation , although they do not contain any of the same ingredients as the natural drug			2
users have described @entity11 as ' very , very potent ' , far more powerful than ordinary strains of cannabis			1
the drug has not been specifically outlawed under current anti-narcotic legislation , but can not be advertised for human consumption			2
similar substances are usually marketed as ' herbal blends ' , and are sometimes specifically labelled as being unsuitable for ingestion			0
' then the police arrived and put handcuffs on me and took me into a police van in full view of everyone on the street			0
' i 've never had any trouble with police			0
i did n't assault anyone - i just raised my voice as anyone would have done as a concerned parent			0
' mr @entity7 said that his daughter had been behaving increasingly erratically over the preceding months - and had even tried to run away from home			1
the teenager has kicked in walls and ripped panels off doors at her family home in @entity123 , near @entity27 , and her panic attacks mean she can no longer sleep on her own			0
@entity9 's family had no idea what was triggering her mood swings until she admitted she had been regularly smoking the synthetic cannabis drug over the past year			0
it is sold in a clear tube labelled ' @entity11 ' , with no indication of what the product actually contains			2
' because it is a legal high she thinks it 's ok , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' she 's been taking it two or three times a week for a year			0
' if they are going to sell legal highs they should come with health warnings			0
but i think these shops need to be closed down			0

@entity21 , 17 , has been behaving erratically since taking @entity11
father @entity7 went to market store where she bought drug and berated staff
pushed to ground by security staff and fined £ 40 by police for *disruption*
