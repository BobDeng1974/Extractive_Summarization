you 're sat on your lunch break scrolling through your latest dating app when who should pop up but your boss			1
awkward ? it 's a situation of nightmares			1
new dating app @entity7 , which is currently going through a soft launch , could put an end to potential inter-office dating dramas			1
the new app which has been started by former @entity14 employee @entity13 allows you to enter your @entity17 information , blocking out those who you work with			1
meaning you never have to fear that you 'll stumble across your colleagues again			1
after trying out @entity29 she realised that she did n't want everyone to be able to see that she was online dating			1
' i found myself single and i figured it must be this really cool thing if everyone was using it			2
[ but ] i got a little bit uncomfortable that everybody and their mother could see you on the app , ' she said			2
@entity13 also felt that @entity29 - where users can swipe left for people they do n't fancy and right for those they do , based on a series of pictures - was a little shallow			1
' [ with @entity29 ] you ’re swiping based on whether you think someone is good looking or not			1
in my relationships , i ’m attracted to things like ambition , and what people do in their free time			2
whereas @entity29 is basically a glorified hot - or - not			2
' @entity7 - which has initially launched in @entity58 - promise to allow you to , ' keep it classy			1
' they say , ' we hide your profile from friends , business contacts & coworkers – the whole office does n't have to know you 're on the prowl			2
' currently if you want to join the app then you need to be referred by a friend			2
you will then be vetted on the basis of your education and your career before you are allowed to start using @entity7			1
and @entity13 is hoping that after the soft launch the @entity73 will be rolled out to many more cities			1
@entity13 said , ' we do n’t want to be @entity77 and we do n’t want to be just @entity78			2
but , i guess if you have to choose between superficial and elitist , i choose elitist			0
' any app that shows what people are and how they spend most of their day is less superficial than a game of hot or not			0
' can new dating app singled out help you weed out the type of men who send unsolicited sexual photographs ? sick of facing a barrage of requests for sexually explicit pictures from dating app users ? tired of being sent their photographs without even having asked ? then @entity73 might be for you			0
the new app , which is being sold as ' the first female friendly dating experience , ' aims to weed out all those unsolicited messages putting the full control in the hands of it 's female users			0
a woman posts a picture of herself and asks a question , men are then invited to answer her singled out , which was started in the @entity109 , works by allowing women to pose one of 200 questions to men on the @entity114 can then choose which people they want to interact with based on their answers			1
the questions can be anything from , ' do you sing in the shower ? ' to , ' would you date outside your race ? ' and ' is @entity122 a better couple than @entity124 / @entity125 ? ' @entity127 's marketing guru @entity126 explains , ' some of the questions seem random but what is really happening is the male user taking the time and effort to figure out the female			0
' when the men have answered the question users are shown a list of those who agree with them so they can carry on a conversation if they wish and unlike other apps there is literally no option for men to speak to women until they have answered the proposed question			0
the singled out team created the app after consulting 300 female students , most of whom suggested that their hesitation to use dating apps came from the fact that they were worried about receiving unsolicited sexual pictures and messages			0
the app aims to allow users to get to know each other a little bit better - through the questions - before they embark on a more serious conversation			0
the hope also that if men are encouraged to engage with the woman before the actual conversation starts they are more likely to have an interest in her and therefore are more likely to meet up and be interested in a proper relationship			0
this is in stark contrast to popular apps like @entity29 or @entity169 where often the only thing the user has to go on is a picture			0
singled out is the third female friendly dating app to have been released in recent months			0
there are also @entity176 , which filters messages by picking up on those that use swear or crude , sexual words			0
and @entity183 , which keeps your picture private until you feel comfortable to release it to your match .			0
