by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 the @entity3 at @entity4 is expected to be another fiercely contested battle between @entity6 and the @entity7 , but the first point may just have been scored by the @entity7 team			1
in the fashion competition , that is			0
that point will not count towards the holy grail of 14 - and - a - half points needed by the winning team in @entity15 , but if the @entity7 are unable to arrest an alarming record of five defeats in the last six @entity19 , then at least they will look good while losing			2
@entity20 have unveiled the @entity7 team 's playing uniforms for all three days at @entity4 , where @entity6 will attempt to retain the trophy between 26 - 28 september			1
and very smart they are too			0

' although anyone who has seen some of the crimes against fashion worn in past @entity19 ( most notably at @entity84 in 1999 ) might question that statement			0
it continues : ' @entity20 presents a patriotic collection of commemorative apparel and official team uniforms to be worn by the @entity7 @entity3 team			1
' embodying the spirit of the @entity7 @entity3 team , iconic stars and stripes , graphic color - blocking and a classic palette of red , white and blue define the official on - course looks			1
