cover - up : former archbishop @entity1 allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes , a judge 's report claims a former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed , the abuser ’s victims have said			1
@entity1 , the former archbishop of @entity14 , did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him , a scathing report revealed yesterday			1
but despite that , @entity1 remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the @entity22			2
@entity23 and @entity24 , who were among seven victims of the very reverend @entity26 , former @entity27 , said it is ‘ incredible ’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post			1
the report by judge @entity33 said @entity1 failed to act because his ‘ concern for the welfare of @entity26 seems to have been paramount ’			1
@entity26 , who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007 , targeted young choirboys over several decades			1
one of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989			0
mr @entity24 , 59 , who was abused when @entity26 was a priest in @entity41 in the 1960s , sent a picture of disgraced @entity46 peer @entity44 , who was jailed for perjury , to the @entity49 @entity48 , adding : ‘ i would be pushing for @entity1 to be treated in the same way as this fellow			1
’ mr @entity23 , now 41 , was abused by @entity26 between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at @entity54			1
he said : ‘ it ’s just incredible @entity1 still has a position			2
here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet			0
' he failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him			0
he is still allowed to sit in the @entity63			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’d like to see him punished			0
my opinion is that he ’s committed a crime , perverting the course of justice , and should face the consequences			0
’ @entity26 died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 mr @entity23 said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993			2
@entity26 then moved to @entity78 , where more children were abused			2
he stayed in a lesser post there until 2005 , despite the allegations made to @entity1 , according to the report , which was commissioned by current archbishop of @entity14 , the most reverend @entity84			1
mr @entity23 said : ‘ here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet , when it came to doing the same thing themselves , they were incapable			0
’ mr @entity23 , now living in the @entity90 with a long - term girlfriend , added that he has put the abuse behind him			0
but he believes @entity26 ’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim , a former chorister from @entity96 named in the report only as @entity98 , who was abused in the 1970s , developed depression and schizophrenia , and committed suicide in 1989			1
@entity1 , 76 , has described judge @entity103 ’s report as ‘ flawed ’ but offered a ‘ personal and profound apology ’			2
he said : ‘ this report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover - up			0
hindsight is a wonderful thing			0

very reverend @entity26 sexually abused choirboys for decades
*inquiry* into the abuse has *slammed* @entity1 , former archbishop of @entity14
report claims he was made aware of *misconduct* 19 times but did not act
despite this - he still holds *influential* post and sits in the @entity63
