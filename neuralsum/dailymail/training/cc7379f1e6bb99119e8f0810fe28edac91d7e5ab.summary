it looks like something which could be seen in the hit film @entity2			1
but these shocking images - which show garden sheds and garages transformed into dodgy homes for immigrants - are not from the slums of @entity9			1
incredibly , they are from a west @entity12 suburb			1
according to @entity15 , the sheds in @entity14 have been built by rogue landlords who are cashing in on newcomers to the country			1
@entity12 not @entity9 : aerial photographs in @entity14 , @entity12 , where almost every house has an illegally built home in the back garden containing anywhere between one and six illegal immigrants they are completely hidden from view from the street and are a clear breach of strict planning laws			1
illegal immigrants have made some of the tiny shacks their homes , some of which are highly dangerous			1
rats and cockroaches roam around the units , while others have poor wiring and sanitation			1
others are adorned with flat - screen tvs , power showers and central heating			2
disaster zone : @entity46 , who acted as young @entity47 in the @entity49 - winning film @entity2 , inspects the ruins of the shanty she lived in at @entity53 slums , @entity9 , @entity54 @entity55 : the greeting at @entity14 station is a clue that the area has a large @entity61 community known as ‘ @entity62 ’ , @entity14 is home to a huge @entity61 population , one of the biggest concentrations outside @entity54			2
the town has dozens of @entity54 restaurants and a huge @entity61 shopping centre			2
it was used as the location for hit 2002 @entity73 film @entity74 , starring @entity75 and @entity76			2
it also boasts a royal connection - @entity80 ’s mother @entity79 was born there , moving away when she was 11			2
however , its history contains darker patches			2
in 1981 it was the scene of devastating race riots , which saw a pub burnt down and hundreds of @entity87 and right - wing skinheads fighting in the streets			2
sixty police officers and 120 rioters were injured during the violence			2
in 1997 , meanwhile , tragedy struck when a high - speed train smashed into a stationary freight train near the town , leaving seven dead and 139 injured			0
@entity97 , who is originally from the @entity98 in northern @entity54 , shares a shed with three others for £ 500 a month in @entity100			0
the @entity54 labourer , who arrived in @entity73 on a student visa , told @entity15 : ' i 'm here to work			0
if i wanted to study i could have stayed in @entity54			0
' @entity97 told how if the council raided the shed where he pays rent then there are ' a thousand other places like this we can stay in '			1
he also told how he thinks rogue landlords flout planning rules			1
' you just have to say you 're building a shed for tools			0
once you 've got the doors on , you can do what you like			0
' another immigrant told how he had been there for nine years and had never had a visit from the council			1
it is believed there are 10,000 similar shacks in @entity12 and the @entity125			1
many people who live in them are cash - in - hand manual workers who pay no tax			0
a man claiming to be the landlord told the newspaper how he was currently building a shed at the bottom of his garden			0
he had built another five years earlier and charges £ 40 per person per week			0
' it 's up to you how many tenants you put in , ' he said			0
' i 've had no problems from the council - not yet			1
you just say you are bulding a garage			0
' planning permission is always needed if a homeowner builds or converts an outbuilding for people to live in			1
the @entity150 states that council officers must give 24 hours ' notice before visiting properties			1
this means evidence of people living in the garages and sheds can easily be removed , which has led to criticism of the system by some @entity162 councillors			0
an @entity164 spokesman told @entity15 : ' this is a growing problem across @entity12			1
we wrote to the government in july to highlight flaws in the law that mean we have to give written notice before we can enter a property , making it very hard to prove buildings are being used as accomodation			0
' a spokesman for the @entity176 said local authories already had a wide range of enforcement powers to clamp down on beds with sheds			0
the spokesman added : ' ministers are however in discussion with local authorities on this issue			0
' loyal : some members of the @entity61 community in @entity14 have lived there for 50 years			0

rats and cockroaches roam in hidden world
planning rules are clearly flouted as council claims it is a growing problem across @entity12
