by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:49 est , 14 february 2014 @entity4 's video to her number one single 's & m ' , which has been watched by nearly 49 million people on @entity7 , could be banned after a @entity9 photographer claims she copied his work			0
@entity13 based @entity12 , 22 , from @entity9 , claims some scenes in the pop star 's bondage - themed video were based on his fashion photography series " @entity18 "			1
@entity12 ' work included a woman in a red dress held against a wall in plastic wrapping with black tape x-marks			0
' it is shocking that a company like @entity29 music , which generates its turnover with intellectual property , copies the intellectual property completely unauthorised and without respect , ' said @entity12 , who is fighting his case in a court in @entity47 , @entity9			1
@entity12 ' lawyer , copyright specialist @entity48 , said @entity29 had admitted the similarities some time ago but had not made a reasonable offer to settle the matter , prompting the legal case			2
@entity13 based @entity12 , 22 , from @entity9 , claims a scene in the pop star 's bondage - themed video was based on his fashion photography series " @entity18 " one of the scenes from @entity4 's 's & m ' music video which a @entity9 artist says is copied from his work a scene from @entity4 's video , produced by her record label @entity29 , features the @entity33 popstar in a red dress by a wall in plastic wrapping with black tape x-marks			1
the scene appears to be similar to photographs taken by @entity12 he said : ' certain video scenes of the music video 's & @entity73 ' are essentially the basics of the copyright protected achievements and creations of my client			2
' in 2011 @entity12 began legal action over the issue , shortly after another photographer accused @entity29 and @entity4 of stealing his ideas for the @entity85 video			1
well - kown @entity33 photographer @entity86 argued in documents filed in @entity88 in @entity13 that certain scenes in the 's & @entity73 ' video were ' directly derived from and substantially similar ' to eight of his photographs			0
after failing to come to an out of court settlement with the music giants , @entity12 has now filed claims for an injunction as well as a claim for damages			1
if @entity12 wins his case , @entity29 could face , among other things , a ban on broadcasting the video not only on @entity7 but also on television worldwide			1
' the ludicrous thing about this situation is that @entity29 has for some time been bringing about a wave of lawsuits against end users for copyright infringements , yet as far as our case is concerned the usage from the photo series ' @entity18 ' by @entity12 in the music video 's & m ' is a serious and worldwide infringement of copyright , which is the responsibility of @entity29 , ' added lawyer @entity48			2
@entity12 ' legal costs for the trial in @entity47 are being funded by @entity121 from @entity122 , which enables him to fight the music giant			0
@entity12 ' lawyer , copyright specialist @entity48 , said @entity29 had admitted the similarities some time ago but had not made a reasonable offer to settle the matter @entity12 said : ' of course as a young artist i am not prepared to use my whole start - up capital to fight against the cold shoulder of a big player like @entity29			2
i am really happy that after the out - of - court settlement fell through almost two years ago i am now being given the opportunity to work with @entity137 and my lawyers to fight for my rights			1
' lawyer @entity48 added : ' @entity29 music exploited the economic inferiority of my client in the out of court settlement talks			1
after @entity137 joined the case as the financer , those strategies will no longer work			0
' in an earlier interview @entity12 said he was amazed that @entity4 did not express more originality in her work			0
' why a worldwide celebrity is not able to afford a creative director , who creates individual concepts and staging , is incomprehensible to me , ' he said			0
@entity12 added : ' while i really respect @entity4 's talents as a musician , nevertheless it is important to respect the creations of others , even young talent - and not to copy their work without legitimacy for earning money with it in order to make money			0
' the case continues .			0

@entity12 claims scenes in the video are lifted from his photography
@entity29 failed to agree an out - of - court settlement , his lawyers say
