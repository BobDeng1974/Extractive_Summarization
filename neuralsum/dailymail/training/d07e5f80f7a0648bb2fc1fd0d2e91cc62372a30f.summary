' stop doing this ' : @entity2 ( left ) e-mailed @entity6 chairman @entity22 ( right ) after learning of the approach by a @entity6 recruiter in 2007 @entity3 , @entity6 , @entity60 and @entity61 asked for a judgment in their favor without a trial , arguing that any no - hire agreements between the companies were reached independently and were not part of an overarching conspiracy			1
@entity51 district judge @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , however , rejected that argument			0

@entity125 , who served on @entity3 's board and also advised @entity6 , discussed attempting to broker a ' cease fire ' between @entity6 and @entity128 , @entity76 wrote			1
@entity128 chief operating officer @entity129 ultimately refused @entity6 's entreaties to join a no - hire agreement , according to court documents			2
