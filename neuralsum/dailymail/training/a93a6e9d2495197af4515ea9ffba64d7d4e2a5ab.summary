the 26 - year - old @entity12 resident who calls himself ' @entity13 ' , is chronicling his edible journey on a hilarious blog called @entity16			1

one week down , six more to go			0
the card entitles to all the pasta his heart desires for the remaining six weeks all of the pasta : @entity13 is blogging is journey trying out the more than 150 different combinations of @entity2 pasta , sauce and meat on a website called ' @entity16 ' @entity13 explained to @entity39 that he won one of the coveted pasta passes by enlisting the help of his friends , who all tried to buy the pass when it recently went on sale			1
one of the four friends lucked out and now @entity13 is on a strict all - carb diet			2
' i 'm not looking to become famous or anything			0
i 'm just a dude who loves to eat and to write , ' he told @entity39			0
now for the 49 days his card is valid , @entity13 , who works in a laboratory , plans to try the more than 150 combinations of pasta , sauce and toppings the restaurant offers			1
' on this site , i will document my journey - the friendships i create and destroy , the changes my body goes through as it adjusts to a purely carbohydrate - based diet , ' @entity13 writes on the blog			1
' @entity66 ' has probably been @entity13 's least creative name for a pasta dish so far			1
it consists of spaghetti with marinara ' superbly covered in @entity72 ' ( calorie count : 765 ) appetizing ? @entity13 ate this combination of angel hair pasta , alfredo sauce and two meatballs he calls ' @entity78 's ' on day two of the project ( @entity81 count : 1,300 ) so much cheese : this colorful monstrosity is nicknamed ' @entity84 ' by @entity13 , and consists of penne topped with a rich five cheese marinara sauce ( calorie count : 760 ) ' on the lighter side ' : @entity13 's ' @entity88 ' of fettuccine , marinara and two meatballs has been one of his ' healthiest ' meals yet ( calorie count : 740 ) while his body did n't initially take well to the severe increase in sodium , @entity13 says the challenge is now going ' surprisingly well ' as he balances out the empty calories of his pasta meals with servings of salad			1
' things looked grim at first - i had pretty severe side effects from all the food and sodium			0
but as i found my balance of portion control and eating salad alongside the pasta , those effects subsided and now i feel healthy and alert ! ' he said			0
pasta ( average calories : 416 ) @entity113 : 460 cavatappi : 440 @entity115 : 430 penne : 390 spaghetti : 400 @entity118 : 380 sauce ( average calories : 406 ) @entity121 : 660 five @entity122 : 370 marinara sauce : 130 meat sauce : 300 @entity125 : 600 @entity126 : 380 meat ( average calories : 265 ) @entity129 : 240 two @entity131 sausages : 470 two meatballs : 180 @entity133 : 170 total average calories : 1,087 those problems surfaced as early as day three , when @entity13 wrote that ' there are certain things man was not meant to eat			1
' ' today , my body made it quite clear to me that " nothing but pasta , forever , " is near the top of that list			0
i will spare you the details , but suffice to say it will take some time for equilibrium to be re-established and for me to restore order among the bacterial fauna of my gut , ' he wrote			0
while @entity13 eats a bowl of pasta for lunch , and orders three for dinner , he insists that he does n't actually lick the plates clean			2
rather , he eats a small portion for lunch , two full bowls for dinner and just a small helping of the fourth and final bowl			0
the rest he kindly takes home to share with his sister			0
' so far i have n't gotten bored			0
there 's a surprising amount of subtle differences amongst the menu items once you start looking for them , ' @entity13 said			2
at the end of each day , @entity13 posts pictures of the day 's meals along with reviews of the different combinations , which he gives clever names like ' @entity88 ' , ' regret ' , and ' @entity84 ' which described a plate of penne drenched in cheese marinara sauce			2
the pasta pass project has already been rife with drama , after just one week			1
on day six , @entity13 had to explain to the new manager of his @entity2 , that the pasta pass entitles card holders to unlimited to go orders			1
that matter was eventually cleared up			0
and on day five , @entity13 brought a date to dinner and she seemed less than impressed by his pasta pass status			1
but at the end of day seven , @entity13 is filled with enthusiasm for the weeks ahead			0
' life seems full of color , the future seems full of possibility , and i seem full of pasta , ' @entity13 writes			2
seafood : @entity13 calls this plate ' catch of the @entity203 ' , and it includes curly cavatappi pasta and marinara with a topping of fried shrimp ( calorie count : 740 )			2
