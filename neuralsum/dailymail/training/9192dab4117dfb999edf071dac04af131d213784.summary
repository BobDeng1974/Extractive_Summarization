by @entity0 last updated at 7:03 pm on 31st january 2012 six rowers feared for their lives when they were thrown from their 36ft boat into the middle of the turbulent @entity5			2
the crew of five @entity7 and an @entity8 , who were trying to set a new speed record for crossing the ocean , were 520 miles from their destination on @entity12 when disaster struck			1
two large waves hit the rowing boat , turning it sideways and filling it with water			2
with seconds , it had capsized - throwing five of the men into the sea , and leaving another trapped upside down with his feet in a harness			2
only when the entangled crewmember had been freed by his shipmates , and a roll call had been taken , did the rowers know they had survived the initial incident			2
upturned : the crew of the @entity30 were taking part in the @entity33 challenge to row from @entity34 in north @entity35 to @entity12 in the @entity36 they were 27 days into their arduous journey , which began at @entity40 in @entity34 - and had been hoping to set a new record by crossing the @entity5 in 30 days , which they described as ' the four minute mile of rowing '			1
after setting of a rescue beacon to summon help , they had a grim wait of 14 hours in a life raft before they could be saved by a cargo ship			1
and while the crew 's families were waiting for them at their planned port of arrival in @entity57 , @entity12 , the cargo ship was going the other way - so they are to end their abortive voyage in @entity60 on the same side of the @entity5 they set off from , in ten days			1
tonight the captain of the doomed rowing expedition , @entity64 , 33 , speaking from the cargo ship which rescued his team , told how they had escaped a watery end			2
he had been rowing with fellow @entity7 @entity68 , a 45 - year - old father of four , @entity69 , 37 , a father of three from @entity70 , father - of - two @entity71 and 29 - year - old @entity73 , a documentary maker from @entity75 , @entity76 , as well as @entity77 , 26 , from @entity78 , @entity79			1
mr @entity64 , of @entity80 in @entity81 , said that after ten days of difficult weather , with unpredictable swells coming from every direction at their boat , the @entity30 , the end finally came on monday morning			1
it happened as first one wave , then another , lashed their fragile craft			0
mr @entity64 said : ' as the wave moved through it rotated the boat through 110 degrees			0
capsized : the five @entity7 and one @entity79 rower were 27 days into their journey when the 36ft vessel overturned at 11am yesterday , 520 miles from their destination ' she instantaneously started taking on water and the boat was capsized within about 10 seconds			1
' one of the rowers was in the upturned boat for about 15 seconds because we could n't remove his feet from the harnesses			1
it was quite a relief when she capsized and we called the names - and everybody responded			0
' he said it then took the crew 15 minutes of bobbing around in the water to inflate their life raft and secure it to the capsized rowing boat			1
but the crew of experienced adventurers responded expertly			1
reacting in any other way could have been fatal			0
' frightened is a word i would n't use , it was flight or fight from everybody , ' said mr @entity64			0
' it happened so quickly			0
' the frantic pace soon slowed when the crew spent up to four hours resting in their life raft as they got their strength back from their near - death experience			1
attempt to right their boat then failed , so they set off a second rescue beacon , after one used earlier failed to draw a response			1
but they had a long nerve - wracking wait to be saved			0
@entity144 : the crew of the @entity30 were just 520 miles from their destination when they capsized ' the time went incredibly slowly , it was a traumatic experience , ' said mr @entity64			1
in total it was 14 hours , and in the early hours of this morning , before they were picked up by a @entity153 flagged merchant vessel , the @entity155 , which was en route from @entity157 to @entity158			0
the mother of rescued rower @entity69 , @entity160 , said she had a sleepless night after hearing the team 's organisers on dry land had lost contact following the capsize			2
mr @entity69 said : ' at about 3am this morning i just heard that they had been picked up by a cargo ship - which was a great relief			0
' i had n't slept - i had n't slept since he left , actually			0
' mrs @entity160 went on : ' i think they will be totally gutted that it 's happened , that it 's ended like this , because they were you know really on for the record			0
' they were really up for it , they were going well and i did n't expect it to end like this but i 'm glad that they 're safe			0
' coastguards in @entity183 , @entity184 , had helped coordinate the international rescue of the rowers after the emergency beacon was detected			0
they then managed to contact the rowers by satellite phone , and traced the nearest cargo vessel			0
it is not the first near - calamity to hit @entity195 rowers			0
three years ago ill - fated skipper mr @entity64 had already been rescued on an earlier cross-atlantic rowing bid after his boat lost its rudder when it crashed into a whale			2
and in december two transatlantic rowers , briton @entity201 and @entity202 , who is half @entity205 half @entity203 , had to be rescued from a life raft in the middle of the ocean because their small boat sank in rough seas .			1
