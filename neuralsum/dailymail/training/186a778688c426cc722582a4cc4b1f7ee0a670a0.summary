by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has issued an apology for their social media posts , made in the wake of @entity7 jetliner @entity6 being shot down , which received intense scrutiny for being insensitive			1
after the @entity13 plane went down over @entity14 with 298 people on board on thursday , postings on @entity10 and @entity11 from @entity2 claimed that its flights do not fly across @entity14 airspace			1
the remarks received hundreds of scathing comments across the social media platforms , from people both offended by the airliners lack of ' ethics ' and others who claimed their post 's claims were false			0
@entity2 posted this message on their social media pages following the announcement that @entity7 airline @entity32 had been shot down other social media users responded to the airliners posts with outrage , claiming the company was being ' insensitive ' and ' unethical ' ' a post starting with @entity38 ( and ) then , stating your planes are diverted and not using this airspace anymore would have made ( you ) sound less heartless ! ' @entity42 wrote on @entity10			1
' this statement is totally unethical			0
have some respect for the one 's who lost their lives , ' @entity45 wrote on @entity11			0
others drew attention to tracking reports that recorded a @entity2 plane traveling within 25 kilometres of @entity6 just before it was shot down above @entity14			1
however , some social media users felt many were overreacting to @entity2 ' remarks , and said the carrier was merely trying to get a message across to its customers			0
messages of condolences were posted by @entity2 after the initial posts , however the company still sent an email apology afterwards ' i do n't think their comment was to advertise or boast their flight routes as much as it was to ease the tension of the hundreds of passengers that are scheduled to fly out to other countries over the next few days , ' @entity64 wrote on @entity10			1
on saturday , @entity2 apologized and tried to clarify its remarks			0
' we are aware of that our @entity10 and @entity11 update on friday morning may have come across as insensitive to some			2
the post was in response to many requests from our customers who had asked for information about our flight routes for their upcoming flights with us , ' @entity2 said in an email to @entity0			2
' we recognize that the information could have been better communicated and we sincerely apologize if it had offended our customers and anyone else in the online community , ' it said			0
others were critical of news that emerged of two planes , including one @entity2 plane , that had been flying over @entity14 only 25 kilometres from @entity32 when it was shot down two other planes were revealed to be flying within 25 kilometres of @entity32 over @entity14 airspace , as the @entity13 plane was shot out of the sky			1
the news comes alongside criticism and questions as to why commercial plane 's were flying over the airspace at all after the airspace was declared a war zone			0
according to @entity107 , two other aircraft had been shot down above @entity14 in the week before the @entity32 tragedy , a @entity14 military cargo plane and a @entity14 jet fighter			2

the posts were made right after reports that @entity32 had been shot down
@entity2 ' lack of initial condolences led to *public* cries of outrage
