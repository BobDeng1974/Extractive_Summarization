a young mother died from cervical cancer after doctors were accused of missing the signs of her disease nine times and refusing her a smear test , saying that at 20 she was too young			1
@entity7 had complained of pain in her hip and abdomen , as well as heavy bleeding , following the birth of her son @entity13			1
she visited her gp to discuss her symptoms more than six times and attended hospital three times in two - and - a - half years , but was repeatedly told that she had an infection and given antibiotics			1
but despite her repeatedly raising concerns about the pain she was experiencing , her family say she had no physical examinations and was refused a smear test on the grounds that she was too young to have this			0
by the time she was diagnosed with cervical cancer it was too late			1
she had a large tumour measuring 5cm x 6cm x 3cm which was obstructing her cervix and the cancer had spread into her pelvis			1
just three years after she first reported her symptoms after the birth of her son in september 2010 , she was dead at the age of 23 , having spent the last four months of her life on the @entity48 at @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51			1
miss @entity7 , of of @entity52 , @entity50 , was diagnosed with cervical cancer on january 4 , 2013 and began a six week course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy a few weeks later on february 19			1
battle : miss @entity7 visited her gp to discuss her symptoms more than six times and attended hospital three times in two - and - a - half years , but was repeatedly told that she had an infection and given antibiotics the gruelling treatment caused her to suffer side effects such as severe sickness , vomiting and weight loss			1
by may 2013 , the cancer had begun to affect her bowel and bladder and she was admitted to @entity71 because of extreme constipation			2
on june 13 , miss @entity7 's family were told that there was nothing more doctors could do to treat her cancer , and that her condition was terminal			1
she remained in hospital until she died on 7 september 2013			0
now her mother @entity80 has instructed specialist medical lawyers to investigate if more could have been done by her gp and @entity84 doctors to diagnose miss @entity7 earlier and potentially treat her cervical cancer			1
' as a family we are still coming to terms with losing @entity7 and in such tragic circumstances , ' said ms @entity80 , who is now looking after three - year - old @entity13			1
all women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening , with women aged between 25 and 49 encouraged to be tested every three years			0
the starting age was raised from 20 in 2003 , because it was found that cervical screening in younger women can do more harm than good			0
cervical cancer is linked to infection caused by the human papillomavirus ( @entity100 ) , which can cause abnormalities in the cells of the cervix			2
in the majority of cases the immune system clears the infection , but in a small number of women the abnormalities persist , and may turn into something more serious - and if they are not treated can develop into a cancer			2
cervical abnormalities associated with hpv infection are very common in women under 25 , but are rarer in older women , while in the majority of cases abnormalities in young women go away by themselves			0
if younger women were screened , many would test positive for abnormalities , and would be sent for unnecessary treatment to remove the affected cells			0
this treatment may increase the likelihood of a women having a premature baby if she later becomes pregnant , and the treatment process can also cause the affected woman significant anxiety			0
cervical cancer is extremely rare in women under the age of 25 with just 2.6 cases per 100,000 women			0
the @entity136 on @entity137 ( @entity138 ) reviewed evidence over the risks and benefits of screening younger women in 2009 , but decided to keep the age limit of 25			0
the @entity143 also recommends that women should not commence cervical screening before the age of 25			0
source : @entity147 ' she had her whole life ahead of her and was looking forward to watching @entity13 grow up			1
instead her life was cut short and now i hope we can find answers as to why this could happen to my daughter and find out why , after she repeatedly complained to doctors about the pain and discomfort she was experiencing , that she was not diagnosed sooner			1
' it was heartbreaking to see her struggling with her illness as it took hold in the last few months of her life			2
she was incredibly frightened and in a great amount of pain			0
' she began to struggle to communicate with us and was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with her deterioration			0
she became wheelchair bound and extremely weak			0
she wanted to spend time with @entity13 , but she did n't want him to see and remember her in so much pain and distress			0
' before she died , @entity7 was studying for a qualification in health and social care as she wanted to become a social worker			2
she was determined to gain this qualification so that she could give @entity13 the best life possible			0
' ms @entity80 said that by suing the @entity147 for negligence , she hoped to find out if more could have been done to diagnose miss @entity7 's cervical cancer earlier			1
' no other young girls or mothers should have to go through what she did , ' she said			0
@entity147 smear tests are currently offered to women aged between 25 and 64 , with @entity147 guidelines stating that the ' condition is very rare in women under 25			2
' the @entity147 website adds : ' all women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening			2
women aged between 25 and 49 are invited for testing every three years , and women aged between 50 and 64 are invited every five years			0
' being screened regularly means that any abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix can be identified at an early stage and , if necessary , treated to stop cancer developing			2
' it is estimated that early detection and treatment can prevent up to 75per cent of cervical cancers			0
' ' this is a heartbreaking situation as @entity7 was only 23 - years - old when she died and also leaves behind a young son , ' said @entity202 , of @entity204 's solicitors - which is representing ms @entity80			1
' in the couple of years before her death @entity7 had made multiple visits to her gp and the hospital and we are investigating if more could have been done to spot the cervical cancer earlier			1
' although cervical cancer in young women is rare our specialist medical law team has dealt with a number of cases involving women in their twenties from across the country whose cervical cancer was initially missed by doctors			2
decline : just three years after she first reported her symptoms , miss @entity7 was dead , having spent the last four months of her life on the @entity48 at @entity49 in @entity50 ' delays in promptly diagnosing and treating cervical cancer can have devastating consequences and it is vital that doctors focus on the symptoms rather than the age of a woman when deciding whether or not it might be cancer			1
' in this case we are still in the early stages of our investigation as her devastated family just want answers as to what happened during her care			0
' they know nothing can turn back the clock but , this case is about highlighting any potential issues and lessons that can be learnt to hopefully prevent other young women from suffering as @entity7 did			2
' a spokesman from the @entity147 said she was unable to comment on any individual cases .			1
