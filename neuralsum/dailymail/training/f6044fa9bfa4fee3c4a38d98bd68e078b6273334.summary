you want to hate him , you really do			0
there ’s the biting , the diving and the casual racism			0
and even last night there was that ridiculous sense of nurturing a grievances against @entity9 , as though he were a perpetual victim			1
‘ before the game too many people in @entity9 laughed about my attitude over the last few years , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ this is a very good time for me			0
i want to see what they think now			0
it seems that @entity11 wants nothing but unconditional praise , however he behaves			1
yet despite all of those reasons to dislike him , it ’s impossible not to admire @entity11			1
like @entity51 , there may be legitimate reasons not to want him to become a role model for your children			1
but as a footballer , he is throwback to the how you wished you could play the game as a child			0
@entity51 was never quite just a one - man team in 1986			1
there were very good players around him in the likes of @entity63 and @entity64			0
nevertheless , it is true that without @entity51 it is impossible that @entity67 would have won the @entity68			1
likewise , last night it was n’t all about @entity11			1
@entity70 had an excellent game , the perfection of his cross for @entity11 ’s first goal will live long in the memory ; @entity76 held the midfield together , snuffing out threats when they emerged ; and @entity79 , until he went off , was a pest , irritating @entity81 and @entity82 with his incessant pressing			1
and yet at times it felt like one man taking on @entity9 on his own			2
no - one will dispute that @entity11 was the difference between the teams			1
superb : @entity70 also had an excellent game , teeing up @entity11 's first goal with a pinpoint cross harrier : and @entity79 was a pest to @entity9 all night and his passion , his determination to play despite his injury and the sheer joy of scoring against @entity9 represent something important about international football			1
that feeling is hard to replicate when playing for a club			0
it is the burden of symbolically leading a nation in a game of football that brings that degree of intensity and emotional release			0
his extraordinary wide - eyed and ecstatic look when he scored is the reason why football was invented			2
it distilled the joy and aggression that the sport is able to produce in a single moment of skill			0
it is likely that the misjudged grievances he holds against the @entity42 fuelled his performance			2
it certainly did maradona in 1986			2
in a wildly inappropriate language , he described the 1986 @entity68 win over @entity9 as revenge for the @entity128 defeat in the 1982 @entity129			1
‘ it was as if we had beaten a country , not just a football team , ’ wrote @entity51 in his autobiography about that game			2
‘ although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) war , we knew they had killed a lot of @entity128 boys there , killed them like little birds			0
’ heralded : despite his belief otherwise , @entity11 has received great plaudits for his play in @entity9 @entity150 : @entity51 of @entity67 scoring his infamous goal against @entity9 during @entity152 ' 86 @entity11 ’s misguided sense of injustice is not as outlandish as that but it is still very silly			1
but however foolish his motives , the performance remains phenomenal			2
and once the disappointment of losing has passed , that is what we will remember from this game			0
the striker ’s display represented the best of international football last night			0
he led his national team in every sense , through his attitude to the game , with his constant cajoling of his team and by scoring his goals			0
and when a truly great player does that and when it clearly means so much to him , it is difficult not to be impressed and moved , for that is football at its purest			0
what @entity11 did last night will live with us for many years			2
and just like @entity51 ’s goal in 1986 - the second one , that is - one day we will be able to celebrate that .			1

@entity11 's two - goal decimation of @entity9 has to be admired
the @entity32 scored both goals in a 2 - 1 victory over the @entity9
@entity9 now on the verge of a @entity68 exit after losing twice
27 - year - old 's performance *reminiscent* of @entity51 in 1986
