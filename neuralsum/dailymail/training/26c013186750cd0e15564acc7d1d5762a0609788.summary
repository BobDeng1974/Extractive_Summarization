by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 11 september 2013 a woman who thought she had met her perfect man online has issued a stark warning to other lonely hearts after losing more than £ 1,000 to an online con artist			1
and in a cruel twist , when @entity7 , 41 , from @entity8 , confronted the man , he replied with an email saying how much he was enjoying spending her money			1
' i do n’t consider myself naïve and i never thought something like this would happen to me so it ’s important that i let other women know even though it ’s embarrassing to admit , ' said @entity7			1
duped : @entity7 ( above ) was conned by a man who used this stolen photo of a real soldier to woo her ' we ’d been talking for months and exchanged hundreds of emails before cash was mentioned and by that time my guard was down			1
if he ’d asked immediately i would have known			2
' the scam began after office manager @entity7 joined dating website @entity29 and spent £ 79 on a profile on the site			1
after a month , she was contacted by a man purporting to be @entity33 , an officer serving with the @entity34 in @entity35			1
his picture showed a handsome man in @entity34 fatigues			1
initially though , @entity7 was unimpressed			1
' i liked his photograph but there did n’t seem much point because he lived the other side of the world , ' she said			0
' i replied to his message out of politeness and we soon got chatting			0
’ but despite her initial reluctance , ' @entity33 ' , who described himself as a 45 - year - old widower with grown - up children , swiftly started to become an important part of @entity7 's life			1
' the more we talked the more i liked him , ' she admits			0
' we exchanged private email addresses and soon we were in contact every day			0
' devastated : @entity7 has decided to make her story public in the hopes that no one else will fall for a similar scam sometimes @entity33 had to go offline urgently , but as he was serving in a war zone , it appeared to make sense to the besotted @entity7			1
' we grew closer the more we got to know each other			0
the distance seemed less of an issue because he was due to retire anyway			0
' after eight weeks , @entity33 told @entity7 he had strong feelings for her and she admitted she felt the same			1
then , when he told her he had some leave coming up and wanted to travel to the @entity70 to meet her in person , she agreed and says she was ' thrilled ' that she would at last meet her online match			0
' he was n’t pushy , he just said it would be nice to spend time together and get to know each other properly , ' said @entity7 , adding : ' i was thrilled			1
' but her joy was n't to last			0
before he could travel to the @entity70 , said @entity33 , his superior officers would need to know more about her for ' security reasons '			0
unsuspecting , @entity7 agreed , and when a few days later an email asking for personal and contact information arrived , she had no reason to think it was n't from a fellow officer as claimed			1
convincing : along with stolen photos of serving soldiers , the conman also sent shots like this one apology : ' @entity33 ' even apologised for the intrusion before asking @entity7 to hand over more than £ 1000 @entity33 even wrote to apologise for the intrusion and assured her it would be worth it once his leave was granted			1
then , out of the blue , she received an email saying the trip would only be approved if she paid a security deposit of £ 1150 to guarantee his return			2
' i was surprised to say the least but @entity33 said it was common in the @entity34 to stop soldiers going @entity102 , ' said @entity7			1
according to @entity33 , @entity7 would have the cash returned when he rejoined his unit in @entity35			1
she agreed to make an online transfer to the account details he provided and began preparing happily for his visit			1
' i was so excited to meet him and started getting ready for his visit , ' she adds			2
then , another email arrived			0
only , it did n't , as expected , contain details of his visit			2
instead , it was a demand for a further £ 400			2
' this time the alarm bells rang straight away , ' says @entity7			1
' i started thinking about all the information and cash i had already sent			2
' panicking , @entity7 called her bank but found it was too late to stop the transfer			1
' they told me to go to the police , ' she says			0
' as i gave the police officer my statement i felt such a fool			0
swiftly , @entity33 's story began to unravel			2
he was not , as he had claimed a member of the @entity34			1
in fact , he did n't exist at all			0
the police revealed that photos , supposedly of himself , that he ’d sent to @entity7 had been stolen and that the man in the pictures had been a victim of identity theft			1
' i asked him if he was enjoying spending my hard earned money			1
' astonishingly , the conman replied , saying : ' yes thanks '			2
the loving emails had been crafted by a scammer interested in nothing more than her cash			2
distraught , @entity7 emailed the dating site but as his profile had already been removed and his membership terminated there was nothing they could do			1
she continued to email ' @entity33 ' in the vague hope of uncovering information that might help police return her money but all she got was requests for more			2
' i emailed him telling him i knew the truth , that he was nothing more than a con artist , ' she said			0
' i asked him if he was enjoying spending my hard earned money			1
' astonishingly , the conman replied , saying : ' yes thanks			0
' i could n’t believe the cheek of it , ' she says			0
' i was devastated and angry beyond words			0
' ' i never ever thought something like this could happen to me and i still ca n’t believe i was so stupid			0
' i ’m ashamed and embarrassed but i do n’t think i am the first or the last to fall for this so i want to warn other women who think they are talking to soldiers			0
' they may not have asked for cash yet , it may take several months like it did with me			2
if you ca n’t meet them they might not be real			0
i fell for a man that did n’t even exist			0
that hurts just as much as the money			0
' she added : ' if speaking out stops one more women being conned it ’s worth it			0
' asked to comment , dating agency @entity29 said : ' scams are something we take very seriously			2
our moderation team works 24/7 to ensure our members are safe from scammers			0
' occasionally , one may slip through the net			0
we would like to apologise to @entity7 for any distress or upset this may have caused			2

@entity7 , 41 , from @entity8 , was *tricked* out of more than £ 1,000
she met the conman , who claimed to be a @entity34 soldier , on a dating site
after eight weeks , he asked to visit @entity7 and the demands for cash began
by the time she realised what was happening , it was too late
when she confronted the thief , he said he enjoyed spending the money
