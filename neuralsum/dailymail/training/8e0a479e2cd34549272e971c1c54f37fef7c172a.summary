by @entity0 a deadly jaguar stalks along a riverbank with its sight set on a caiman - before ruthlessly attacking it and dragging it away			2
the action - packed images of the one - eyed jaguar were captured in the @entity11 wetlands of western @entity12			1
the stealthy cat known locally as ' @entity14 ' is blind in one eye after a previous fight with a caiman and was caught prowling the bank before diving into the water and emerging with the reptile firmly in its @entity22 down for video @entity24 : the jaguar is a beautiful and striking sight as it confidently walks through wetlands in @entity12 ruthless : the one - eyed jaguar was seen prowling the bank before he sorted out what he would have for lunch in @entity11 , @entity12 river : the jaguar crawls slowly into the river with only one thing on its mind : catching the caiman the hungry predator then retreated into jungle to enjoy his prize			1
this is not the first time the jaguar - also nicknamed ' one - eye ' by locals - has been spotted attacking a caiman			2
last year footage of the cat pouncing onto its prey on a sandbank made headlines around the world - but it appears this animal has a taste for reptiles			1
dr @entity56 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , witnessed the spectacular moment in september last year but has only just released the images			1
shallow water : the jaguar is fully immersed in water as it begins to hunt its prey it makes sure that it can see everything from all angles catch : the jaguar emerges with the reptile firmly in its jaws whilst the caiman puts up a fight but only one will come out on top fight : the two continue to struggle and fight with each other , but the jaguar is far stronger and carries away its prey by the scrap of its neck he said : ' we watched as he climbed a sandy hill , paused , and then leapt into a large pool , covered in reeds and water hyacinth			2
' for the next 15 seconds we watched the reeds waving and heard loud splashing			0
then the reeds parted and he walked towards us carrying a dead caiman in his mouth			0
' having demonstrated his prowess he then disappeared into the trees to enjoy his lunch			0
' according to scientists , there are an estimated 4,000 - 7,000 @entity92 in the @entity11			0
lunch : the jaguar looks a little bloody as it carries the reptile in its jaws through grass and wetlands in preparation for a hard - fought feast attack : the one - eyed jaguar pins the caiman down and sinks its teeth in the caiman 's head as it finishes off the job once and for all dr @entity56 said : ' having demonstrated his prowess he then disappeared into the trees to enjoy his lunch ' they have become specialist caiman killers and hunt during broad daylight , surprising the cold - blooded reptiles while they bask in the sun. they are also the largest and most powerful jaguars in @entity118 , enabling them to take down larger prey			1
jaguars are starting to become a tourist pull in this area because they can be regularly seen in broad daylight			0
elsewhere , jaguars - who are estimated to number between 50,000 and 100,000 through @entity118 and @entity126 - are often hunted and tend to be shy and reclusive , making them much harder to see in the wild .			0
