for the first time , evidence of frankincense being used in the elaborate burials of @entity4 's elite has been discovered			1
archaeologists have been able to prove that the religious resin was used by wealthy @entity8 , who settled in areas of the country , including @entity11 and @entity12 , more than 1,700 years ago			1
the sweet smelling substance , which was more valuable than gold for millennia , was found on skeletal remains and plaster body casings dating back to the 3rd and 4th centuries			2
@entity19 ( pictured ) , one of the gifts carried by the @entity21 in the @entity23 story , was used in elaborate burials in @entity4 more than 1,700 years ago , according to new research the discovery shows that even while the @entity28 was in decline , the precious resin was being transported to its furthest northern outpost for use in funerals of high ranking individuals			1
until now , evidence for the use of resins in ancient funerary rites has rarely come to light outside of @entity39			0
the discovery was made by carrying out molecular analysis of materials previously thought to be of little interest – debris inside burial containers and residues on bones - which looked like mere dust			2
chemical analysis carried out on 49 burials in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity11 and @entity12 revealed traces of the southern @entity55 sap from the @entity57 tree , on four of them			2
another 10 contained evidence of other resins from the @entity61 and northern @entity62			0
it ’s the first time archaeologists have been able to prove that @entity19 was used by @entity8 who settled in @entity4			1
traces of the resin were found inside the coffin of a wealthy @entity4 woman who was buried in the fourth century ad in @entity11 , or @entity70 as it was known			1
her silt - filled coffin is shown left and bust , right @entity19 comes from the resinous sap from a unique family of @entity77 trees			2
only one , @entity79 , produces the highest grade of frankincense , also known as ‘ true ’ or ‘ commercial ’ incense			0
careful incisions are made in the tree at key times of year , and the sap slowly pours out			0
once the sap dries and hardens it is ready to be used			0
to release its scent the frankincense is either burned or smouldered over hot coals			0
classical texts claim that the aromatic , antimicrobial substances were used as a practical measure to mask the smell of decay , or slow decomposition during the often lengthy funeral rites of the @entity4 elite			1
but it was @entity19 ’s ritual importance that justified its transportation from one end of the @entity28 to the other			1
seen both as gifts from the gods and to the gods , resins were thought to purify the dead and help them negotiate the final rite of passage to the afterlife			0
@entity112 , a student at the @entity113 , explained : ‘ archaeologists have relied on finding visible resin fragments to substantiate the descriptions of burial rites in classical texts , but these rarely survive			1
‘ our alternative approach of analysing grave deposits to find the molecular signatures of the resins - which fortunately are very distinctive - has enabled us to carry out the first systematic study across a whole province			2
’ the resins were only recovered from burials of higher status individuals , identified from the type of container used , the clothing they were wearing , and items buried with them			0
professor @entity133 from the university said : ‘ it is remarkable the first evidence for the use of frankincense in @entity4 should come from such seemingly unpromising samples , yet our analysis demonstrates that traces of these exotic resins can survive for over 1,700 years in what others would reject as dirt			1
’ classical texts mention these aromatic , antimicrobial substances as being used as a practical measure to mask the smell of decay or slow decomposition during the often lengthy funeral rites of the @entity4 elite			1
the resin was also presented to the baby jesus by the @entity21 ( illustrated ) one of the frankincense - impregnated coffins contained the remains of a noble woman , who was laid to rest with expensive jewellery			2
the rich young lady was buried in a sarcophagus in the fourth century and her remains were discovered near @entity165 in the @entity166 in 1999			0
dr @entity167 , of the @entity168 , which is home to the remains , said : ‘ this eye - opening study has provided us with new and amazing insights into the funerary rituals of late @entity4			1
the research , published in the @entity177 , mentions resins from three different plant families , including pistacia from the @entity61 or the @entity181 , @entity182 from northern @entity62 and @entity183 ( frankincense ) from southern @entity55 and eastern @entity185			0
the @entity8 , @entity186 , @entity39 and @entity187 all used frankincense as part of their religious ceremonies			1
it was extensively used in burial rituals as an embalming material , an offering to the departed , and a means to cover the odour of the dead body			0
the roman emperor , @entity197 , burned an entire year ’s harvest at the funeral of his favourite mistress and the resin of course featured in the @entity203 , which is where many westerners recognise it from			0
frankincense comes from the resinous sap from the @entity209 sacra tree ( pictured ) and the sap is extracted by making careful incisions in the tree 's bark			0

experts at the @entity113 analysed @entity4 coffins and bones
they found traces of @entity19 on four of the 4th century caskets
it 's the first time archaeologists have been able to prove that the religious resin was used by wealthy @entity8 who lived and died in the @entity226
study shows resin was transported during declining of the @entity28
ritual importance and practical burial *properties* justified the long *journey*
