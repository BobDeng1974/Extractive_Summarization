below , @entity15 tells one nominee â€™s story			0
@entity18 treasures the memories of her son @entity20 's first @entity21 in 2006 - the five - month - old gazing in wide - eyed wonder at the fairy lights , reaching past the presents for the scrunchy wrapping paper and laughing in deep throaty gurgles at the antics of his three - year - old brother @entity30			1
it was a joyful , carefree day , and @entity18 often gets out the photographs and videos which capture the happiness and show @entity20 's bright blue eyes twinkling with excitement			1
support : dr @entity39 , right , has become like family to @entity18 it was to be their one and only family @entity21 together			1
when he was three weeks old @entity20 was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis , a condition where a faulty gene causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with mucus , making it hard to breathe			1
he had been seriously ill in hospital before @entity21 , but @entity18 had desperately wanted just one normal family day at home with her sons			2
' i just fixed on the dream of him waking up in his cot on christmas morning and showing him the lights on the tree , ' she remembers			0
the magic of that @entity21 was made possible by a doctor who befriended @entity18 , a young , single mother from @entity65			2
dr @entity39 never left her to fend for herself - and even broke away from her own family celebrations to ring @entity18 on christmas day to check how @entity20 was coping			1
' dr @entity67 knew how important that one day at home was to me , and instead of simply saying he had to stay in hospital - which would , frankly , have made her own life easier - she supported me in arranging for him to come home			1
' she responded immediately on @entity74 too , when @entity18 , 29 , was worried about @entity20			1
' he did n't look well , he turned grey and was struggling to breathe , and when i called dr @entity67 , she met us at the hospital to make sure he was comfortable			1
she was n't even supposed to be working , but she came racing to my side			0
gone too soon : @entity20 died in 2007 of @entity79 ' i did ask : " does your family mind ? " and she smiled and said " my husband 's a gp and he 'd do the same for his patients			2
" ' dr @entity67 had been treating @entity20 since he was diagnosed shortly after his birth in july 2006			1
he 'd been referred for tests because he struggled to feed and did n't put on weight			0
he was transferred to the care of dr @entity67 , a respiratory specialist based the @entity91 in @entity65			1
' she kept me strong			0
i had to go home and tell @entity30 something was wrong with his baby brother , and he asked " why ca n't you just kiss it better ? " i felt as if my heart was breaking			0
but dr @entity67 made me feel like i could cope with anything			1
she kept saying : " we 'll try this " , or " we 'll make sure @entity20 is never in pain			2
" ' the word " we " meant i never felt alone			0
' after his @entity21 at home , @entity20 returned to @entity106 where he remained until the end of january			2
in february , 2007 , after he was hospitalised again following a series of infections and breathing problems , he became increasingly unwell and @entity18 was told nothing more could be done			2
she says : ' i could see it myself , a strange shadow seemed to have settled on @entity20 's face			2
he 'd had enough of struggling			0
i rang dr @entity67 and she arranged for him to be transferred by ambulance back to @entity65			1
' we gave him a night to recover from the transfer , and at 6am on the saturday morning , her day off , dr @entity67 walked in , ' says @entity18			1
' she told me that @entity20 would n't feel any pain , and after they switched the ventilator off , i cuddled him			2
she sat with me and kept telling me he was peaceful			0
when he died in the early evening , she told me softly " i 'm sorry , @entity20 's gone , " ' ' she hugged me and cried , too			2
she was n't my doctor that day - she was my family			2
' we bathed @entity20 and dressed him together , then finally , after no sleep or food for 24 hours , i had to go home to tell @entity30 his little brother was gone			2
i could n't bear the thought of @entity20 being alone in a hospital mortuary and i begged dr @entity67 not to leave his side			1
' she took my hands and promised she would n't leave him			0
i know she waited with @entity20 for over an hour before the undertaker arrived			2
the thought of her being by his side remains a real comfort to me			0
precious memories : @entity18 with baby @entity20 pictured in 2006 ' dr @entity67 helped my son die a dignified and painless death , then helped me live with the agony of losing him			1
' it is for this exceptional 24 - hour devotion that @entity18 has nominated dr @entity39 , 57 , for a @entity143 award			1
but the doctor herself , who has no children and lives in @entity148 with @entity150 husband @entity149 , insists she is merely doing her job : ' i simply set out to treat patients the way i would want my own family to be treated			2
@entity155 really is n't a career for anyone who wants a nine - to - five job			0
i am about to retire , and there are so many children and families who stick in my mind and will stay in my memory always			0
' all in a day 's work : the doctor said she tries to treat patients how she would want her family to be treated but despite dr @entity67 's modest protestations that she is simply ' doing her job ' , other families agree that she has thrown them a lifeline , too			1
@entity172 , 41 , from @entity173 , @entity174 , is mother to 15 - year - old @entity175 , who has been under dr @entity67 's care almost all her life			1
@entity172 , is a single mother to @entity178 , 18 , and @entity179 , 14 weeks			0
@entity175 , who has a rare neurological condition which affects the optic nerve and spinal cord , first became ill when she was five months old			0
' i remember dr @entity67 coming into the room , picking her up and running into another ward to ventilate her			1
then , she gave me a hug and told me exactly what was happening in a calm , reassuring way			0
from that moment on , she has given us constant care and attention which has gone way beyond anything i 've ever known from any other doctor			0
' in 2006 , @entity175 lost her sight and became completely paralysed as a result of the condition			0
she 's also needed ventilation on and off throughout her life , and dr @entity67 just sits on her bed and chats to her , and comes to @entity175 's birthday parties at our house			1
' @entity175 ca n't travel abroad , but whenever dr @entity67 has been on holiday she comes racing in and says : " guess what @entity204 , i saw penguins ... " @entity175 just adores her , and the stories become her stories to tell			1
she 'll say : " @entity210 , @entity39 saw the penguins			0
" " when i heard dr @entity67 is retiring , i actually burst into tears			1
there 's been so many hugs , so many late - night phone calls , so much support over the years			0
' @entity18 will also miss the doctor , who kept in contact with her family after baby @entity20 died			1
' when i had my youngest son , @entity220 , four years later , i was terrified he also had cystic fibrosis , even though blood tests said he was free of the genetic condition			1
' i rang her in a terrible state and she arranged to see @entity220 and ran a series of tests to put my mind at ease			0
it was only when she reassured me he was all right that i was finally able to relax and enjoy being a mum again			0
' i have such happy memories of @entity20			0
the fact that i do , and that i 've coped with such loss is down to dr @entity67			1
she tried to save him - and she managed to save me			0

dr @entity39 supported @entity18 when her son was was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis
@entity18 said the doctor was like part of the family throughout their ordeal
@entity20 did n't survive but dr @entity67 helped them cope with the loss
