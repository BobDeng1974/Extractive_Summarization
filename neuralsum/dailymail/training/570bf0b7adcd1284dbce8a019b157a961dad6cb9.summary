scientists have met to discuss the possibility of bringing back 24 animals back from extinction			2
but a real life @entity5 is not an option , it is said , because dinosaur dna is just too old			0
the so called ' de-extinction ' of a number of species was discussed at a @entity12 conference in @entity13 sponsored by @entity14			1
the @entity15 evolved without any natural predators , but it was forced into extinction by humans who killed them all for food			0
it is one of 24 creatures recently discussed during a @entity12 conference on bringing animals back from extinction - also known as ' de-extinction ' another animal considered for ' de-extinction ' at the @entity12 conference was the @entity31 - a species of plains @entity34 that once lived in @entity35			1
the last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 they included the dodo bird , the @entity40 , last seen in 1904 in @entity41 , and the @entity31 , a plains zebra which once lived in @entity35			1
the last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 , the @entity43 reports			2
the teams chose the animals using a number of criteria , and discussed the ethics of bringing them back to life			1
they discussed whether the species were desirable , if they held an important ecological function or if they were beloved by humans			2
they also discussed if they were practical choices , and if there would be access to tissue with good quality @entity62 samples or germ cells in order to reproduce the species			2
they also considered whether they are actually able to be reintroduced into the world and what the reasons for extinction were in the first place			0
this month ’s @entity14 explains how de-extinction works - by taking old dna samples and reassembling them into a full genome			1
this is then injected into embryonic cells which have had their own dna taken out , and a suitable living surrogate is found to give birth			0
the docile , flightless moa stood 12ft high			0
they died out because of over hunting by the @entity84 the @entity85 , related to the elephant , lived on @entity87 in the @entity88 until 4,000 years ago			1
scientists are hoping to use well - preserved dna from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass to bring the species back from the dead according to the @entity97 , ten years ago , a team of scientists from @entity95 and @entity96 brought back an extinct wild goat – but it only lived for 10 minutes			1
@entity99 does however raise a number of ethical and logistical questions , including how scientists can get a usable dna sample from an extinct animal , and also whether they should			1
the @entity104 was last seen in the southeastern @entity105 , but there has n't been a confirmed sighting of the bird since the 1940s the @entity110 , or @entity110 , is the only marsupial to make the list			0
it lived in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 until the 1960s but dinosaur dna has long ago degraded , so researchers say they are fairly sure that a real life @entity5 will never happen in the hit 1993 film , @entity121 hires scientists who use dinosaur dna taken from a mosquito preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park			1
the resulting chaos showed that man and dinosaur should not co-exist			0
last year a controversial @entity114 billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real life @entity5			0
mining magnate @entity136 , who has already embarked on a project to rebuild the @entity139 , was rumoured to be working with the team who created @entity142 the sheep			0
it was said the park would be based at @entity136 's super resort in @entity147			0
but the research has shown the dinosaurs may have to stay on the big screen - as their dna is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction			1
the cost of de-extinction varies by species but it is believed could run into hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
it comes after scientists used cloning technology to attempt to bring back a frog from extinction by implanting a ' dead ' cell nucleus into a fresh egg from another frog species			1
the resulting embryos lived for just a few days			2
but the groundbreaking research by the @entity167 has brought the ' de-extinction ' of creatures like woolly mammoths to the forefront of scientific discussion			2
in repeated experiments over five years , the researchers used a laboratory technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer			0
using a method similar to that imagined in the blockbuster @entity5 , they took fresh eggs from the distantly related @entity181 , deactivated their nuclei and replaced them with genes from the extinct frog			0
some of the eggs spontaneously began to divide and grow to early embryo stage – a tiny ball of many living cells from a creature extinct for 30 years			2
although none of the embryos survived beyond a few days , genetic tests confirmed that the dividing cells contain the genetic material from the extinct frog .			0

species include dodo , the @entity40 , and the @entity31 , a plains zebra
the process is called ' de-extinction ' and poses a number of ethical questions
10 years ago teams brought back extinct wild goat - it lived for 10 minutes
