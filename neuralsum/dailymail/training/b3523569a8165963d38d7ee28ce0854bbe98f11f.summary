by @entity0 published : 16:21 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 29 july 2013 while many of us will be hoping for bronzed limbs this summer , some people may emerge from repeated sunbathing sessions with a rather more unsightly side - effect - dry , scaly rings on the skin that refuse to budge			0
thousands of women suffer from @entity10 ( @entity10 ) - a skin condition that causes red or brown circles on the legs and forearms and is normally triggered by over-exposure to the sun. while some develop just a few of these lesions , normally about one centimetre in size , others have dozens all over their limbs ( the greater the sun exposure , the more rings are likely to appear )			1
lizard look : @entity10 , a skin condition that causes red or brown circles on the legs and forearms , is normally triggered by over-exposure to the sun they also tend to increase in number with age because of cumulative effects of sun exposure which damages cell dna , causing a thickening of the skin			1
the sun can make them red and itchy and they often get darker and more noticeable in summer , as warm weather can cause blood vessels under the skin to dilate			1
although triggered by over-exposure to the sun , the chance of developing it is influenced by genetic factors			1
parents with the condition have a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to their children			1
this is not just due to similar skin types , but also to carrying a faulty gene			0
and sunbathing will make the condition significantly worse , and result in more skin lesions			1
similarly , wearing sun cream may not stop you from developing it , but may lessen its severity			1
many parents will be unaware of the genetic link and could unwittingly be putting their children at risk if they do n't encourage them to cover up in the sun. the condition is most commonly diagnosed among younger women in their 30s and 40s , although no one knows why this group seems to be affected			1
seeing red : sunbathing will make the condition significantly worse and result in more skin lesions @entity74 , 42 , had enjoyed sunning herself on her summer holiday - although she wore sunscreen to protect her fair skin			1
then two years ago , as she turned 40 , she started developing red rings over her arms and legs			1
' i had noticed a few dry patches before then , but as soon as i turned 40 , these lesions started appearing , ' recalls the mother - of - two from @entity84			0
' to begin with i thought it was psoriasis but they were different from that , so i went to the doctor			0
he diagnosed @entity10 and told me the condition runs in families and there was very little i could do about it			1
' the lesions can be unsightly			0
it depends on the weather and time of day - they tend to look better in the morning and get redder when it is warmer or if i have a hot shower and the blood comes to the surface			0
' @entity74 has discovered her mother also has the condition			0
dr @entity105 , a consultant dermatologist and spokesman for the @entity107 , says : ' we usually see this condition in sun - worshippers or those who have used sun beds heavily			2
' the condition tends to affect those of white @entity114 descent who burn easily but tan poorly in the sun. it is more common in women than men and normally develops between 30 and 50 years of age			0
' dr @entity120 , a consultant dermatologist in @entity121 , adds : ' this is yet another reason why we should protect the skin from sun damage			2
' we are now seeing the effects of a generation who spent time in the sun without worrying about it , generally among people who grew up in the @entity132 and before			0
' the vast majority of sun damage occurs during the childhood and teenage years , so it is very important to protect children from the sun to prevent conditions like @entity10 developing			1
' thankfully , the condition itself is not usually dangerous or contagious - professor @entity105 says the risk of the lesions becoming cancerous is ' low '			0
but those with the condition may be at higher risk of developing skin cancer because of their high sun exposure , explains dr @entity120			1
@entity150 ( @entity150 ) light from the sun damages dna within skin cells , and this can lead to the development of cancerous cells			2
the lesions are sometimes misdiagnosed as actinic keratosis - a common skin condition , again linked to sun damage , which often appears on the face and other exposed areas , and in some cases turns to skin cancer			1
they can also be mistaken for psoriasis			0
because of the similarity with actinic keratosis , many patients are unaware they are passing the @entity10 gene on to their children			2
cover up : protect your skin from the sun with clothing , a hat , and @entity176 the bad news is that there is no cure , and treatments to reduce the appearance of the lesions generally do n't work and can even cause side - effects			2
@entity190 ( where liquid nitrogen is sprayed on to the lesions to freeze them off ) , surgery and laser treatments can all cause scarring , and creams such as @entity186 , which boost the body 's immune system to destroy abnormal skin cells , can lead to severe reactions such as redness and inflammation			2
' in most people , no treatment is necessary - because the condition is not a health risk , and treatment is generally not that successful - and reassurance they are not dangerous can be offered , ' according to information from the @entity107 of @entity205			0
' the best way to avoid developing or worsening of this skin condition is to avoid exposure to the sun. ' the advice to anyone concerned about changes to a mole or patch is to seek medical advice			1
and to stay safe in the sun , doctors recommend protecting your skin with clothing and a hat , wearing sunscreen of @entity176 or higher and reapplying every two hours			2
@entity74 has seen an @entity224 dermatologist and has had a couple of the bigger lesions frozen off â€“ which worked , although it made her skin blister			0
but , more than anything , she is extra diligent about sun protection now			0
' i have about 50 lesions on each arm and the same on both of my legs , ' she says			0
' i try to keep my skin covered up , but if i do go out in the sun i always wear sun protection factor 30 or 50 to try to stop the lesions getting worse			0
