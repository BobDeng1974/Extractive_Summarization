@entity1 leader @entity0 today hit back at claims from @entity4 former prime minister sir @entity3 that she poses a ' real and present danger ' to the @entity6			1
in a speech today , sir @entity3 claimed the @entity1 would use any power they wield in @entity10 after the election to foster division and further their dream of the break up of the 300 - year - old @entity15			1
and he mocked ms @entity0 over her demand to play a role in propping up a @entity19 government , when she is ' not even bothering ' to stand as an mp herself			1
@entity19 had argued it would ' kill independence stone dead ' but instead it ' fanned the flame ' which lead to the referendum which left the @entity15 ' battered ' but intact			2
' now , it is at risk again , ' he said			0
@entity19 's only route back to power is in hock to smaller , left wing parties , he said , leading to ' more borrowing , more spending , an end to welfare reform , and far more people dragged into higher tax brackets '			2
welsh nationalists @entity43 would demand more money for @entity46 while the ' worthy ' @entity48 's economic plan is ' a recipe for economic self - harm '			0
he warned of ' mayhem ' if the @entity1 holds the balance of power , with a weak @entity19 government open to a ' daily dose of blackmail ' to secure the support of the nationalists in commons votes			1
the @entity1 would use its role in @entity10 to bolster support ahead of next year 's @entity63 elections , when it will put independence back on the agenda , sir @entity3 said			1
the @entity66 hope to capitalise on a damning poll which shows more than half of @entity6 voters want ms @entity0 and her party to play no part in the next government			1
' the @entity1 is a real and present danger to our future , ' sir @entity3 said			2
' they will pit @entity26 against @entity76			0
that could be disastrous to the people of @entity26 – and fatal to the @entity6 as a whole			2
' but ms @entity0 branded his comments ' an affront to democracy '			0
addressing the @entity84 in @entity85 , she said that @entity1 @entity86 at @entity10 could ' vigorously and loudly ' support a future @entity19 government in some areas			1
the @entity1 leader added : ' @entity3 's comments are silly , over the top and frankly they do n't show him in a particularly good light			1
' i want the @entity1 to go to @entity10 to make @entity26 's voice heard and also to be a voice for better politics , for the kind of politics that stands in opposition to @entity4 policies of austerity and undermining public services and pushing more people into poverty			1
' i can understand why that message of standing up for ordinary people not just in @entity26 but across the @entity6 might offend @entity3 as an @entity108 prime minister , but i think it 's a message that will continue to win support right across @entity26			2
' the former prime minister sought to contrast the ' social division ' he said was sown up @entity19 's politics with the economic competence and ' strongly beating heart ' he said typifies the @entity66 @entity0 is threatening to break up the @entity6 without even ' bothering ' to stand for election to @entity10 , sir @entity3 said today			1
in a personal attack on the @entity1 leader , sir @entity3 cast doubt on the legitimacy of a party which only stands in one part of the country setting the direction of the national government			1
' they are part of the @entity6 and so of course they have got the right to have a degree of legitimacy , ' he said			2
but he accused ms @entity0 of plotting the break - up of the @entity15 from @entity134			0
' what i 'm saying is i do n't think the @entity1 party , whose leader is not even bothering to run for the @entity10 election , are behaving in a way that is in the interest of the @entity6 , by seeking policies that will break @entity26 away from the @entity6			1
' and they emphatically will not deny that separatism is their aim			0
' after last year 's vote saw 55 per cent of @entity26 reject the idea of separation , nationalists insisted the issue was settled for a generation			0
but ms @entity0 has since left the door open to a second referendum before 2020			0
sir @entity3 said the @entity1 would ' manufacture grievance ' to make a @entity156 vote more likely any future referendum			2
' they will ask for the impossible and create merry hell if it is denied			0
the nightmare of a broken @entity6 has not gone away			2
' the separation debate is not over			0
the @entity1 is determined to prise apart the @entity6			1
' ms @entity0 yesterday unveiled an anti-austerity manifesto setting out her price for propping up a weak @entity19 government , including higher spending fuelled by more borrowing			2
polls continue to show up to half of @entity26 are planning to back the @entity1 , robbing @entity19 of dozens of seats and depriving mr @entity169 of hopes of a majority			1
mr @entity169 and ms @entity0 have ruled out a formal coalition with @entity1 mps sitting in @entity174			2
but they have left open the possibility of the @entity1 supporting a @entity19 government on a vote - by - vote basis , raising the prospect of mr @entity169 being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through			1
sir @entity3 warned that this will leave the country open to a ' daily dose of blackmail ' as the @entity1 makes fresh demands in return for supporting @entity19 in commons votes			1
' if @entity19 were to accept an offer of support from the @entity1 , it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote - by - vote basis , ' sir @entity3 said			1
' @entity19 would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left			2
and who would pay the price for this ? we all would			0
we would all pay for the @entity1 's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes , fewer jobs , and more and more debt			2
' this is a recipe for mayhem			0
at the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government , we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies , and open to a daily dose of political blackmail			0
' and @entity19 's @entity219 , who led the no campaign against @entity26 independence , said the @entity66 were ' flirting with @entity223 nationalism ' in a ' desperate ' way which could lead to another period of divisive wrangling over @entity26 's position			0
labour leader @entity169 accused the conservatives and @entity229 of ' talking up ' the @entity1 in the hope that the nationalists will win seats from @entity19 north of the border and allow him to ' crawl back ' into 10 @entity234			1
a poll showed just 22 per cent of voters across the @entity6 back the idea of ms @entity0 playing a role in the @entity6 government , with 54 per cent opposed the @entity1 has already suggested that it will be ' entitled to vote against any bit of legislation ' and ' any bit of spending ' it does not agree with			1
it means that for @entity19 to pass new laws or agree to spending in @entity76 , @entity46 or @entity249 they would have to strike a deal with the @entity1			1
much of the @entity1 manifesto appeared designed to demonstrate common ground with @entity19 , promising to scrap the bedroom tax , reverse @entity255 reforms , increase the minimum wage and tackle energy bills			1
but in key areas it went much further , threatening to drag @entity19 further to the left to make the party ' bolder and better '			0
it included scrapping the @entity262 nuclear deterrent , ending austerity and embarking on a £ 140billion spending spree			0
in a series of co-ordinated @entity4 attacks , @entity229 warned a @entity19 - @entity1 deal would be a ' match made in hell ' for the @entity6 economy			1
@entity272 mayor @entity271 said allowing @entity26 nationalists to preside of the @entity6 government would be like getting ' @entity275 to run a baby farm '			2
but some @entity66 fear the attacks could backfire			0
lord @entity277 - who served as @entity26 secretary in sir @entity3 's government - warned that building up the @entity1 to undermine support for @entity19 in @entity76 could ultimately damage the @entity15			1
' we 've had the dilemma for conservatives , which is they want to be the largest party at @entity10 and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in @entity26 will be helpful , ' he told the @entity290			0
' but that is a short - term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country			0
' ms @entity0 has made clear that in the event of a hung parliament she will be in @entity272 on may 8 to take charge of talks with @entity19			0
' i am the leader of the party , i would lead those discussions if we 're in that scenario			0
however , just 22 per cent of voters across the @entity6 back the idea of ms @entity0 playing a role in the @entity6 government , with 54 per cent opposed			1
it makes the @entity1 by far the least popular potential coalition partner			0
pollsters @entity310 said older @entity6 adults were the most likely to be opposed to @entity1 influence			1
a survey for @entity314 found an astonishing 71 per cent of those aged 65 and over want to lock ms @entity0 out of power , compared to 44 per cent of 18 to 24 - year - olds			0
amid fears of a backlash south of the border , ms @entity0 claimed she was offering the ' genuine hand of friendship ' to the rest of the @entity6			0
she said : ' the @entity1 is n't going to @entity10 to seek to bring down governments or block budgets			0
we 're going to @entity10 to build an alliance for good , positive , progressive , sensible change			0

former @entity4 *pm* warns @entity1 would use role in government to breakup @entity6
@entity1 leader accuses him of being ' silly and over the top ' in speech
polls suggest @entity1 will prop up a @entity19 minority government
