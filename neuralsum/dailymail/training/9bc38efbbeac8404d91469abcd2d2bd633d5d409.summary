the most powerful nuclear bomb remaining in @entity2 ’s arsenal was dismantled yesterday after nearly 50 years of service			1
the @entity4 was capable of releasing nine megatons of energy – 600 times more than the bomb dropped on @entity8 in 1945			1
on explosion , the 9,000lb ‘ bunker buster ’ would have caused lethal burns to anyone within 18 miles , destroyed all buildings within nine miles and was even able to penetrate up to 230m underground			1
but the last one was taken apart yesterday at @entity2 ’s only nuclear weapons facility , the @entity17 plant near @entity18 in @entity19			1
last @entity4 : the 10,000lb bomb will be dismantled at the @entity17 just outside @entity18 , @entity19 the completion of the dismantling program is a year ahead of schedule , according to the @entity2 @entity25 's @entity24 , and aligns with president @entity27 's goal of reducing the number of nuclear weapons			1
@entity30 , the nuclear administration 's chief , called the bomb 's elimination a ' significant milestone '			1
first put into service in 1962 , when @entity37 tensions peaked during the @entity38 , the @entity4 weighed 10,000lbs and was the size of a minivan			1
it was kept airborne on b52 bombers round the clock until 1968 as a nuclear deterrent against the @entity45			1
@entity46 , director of the organisation 's @entity47 : ' it ’s the end of the era of monster weapons , if you will			1
decommissioned : workers unload the @entity4 bomb at the @entity17 near @entity18 end of an era : production technicians conduct a training class on the @entity4 bomb before it is dismantled signed , sealed , delivered : @entity27 and @entity58 shake hands over historic deal to reduce nuclear arms height of the @entity37 : a long line of @entity65 rockets move into @entity67 's @entity66 towards @entity68 during a parade marking the 46th anniversary of the @entity71 in @entity72 in 1963 the @entity8 bomb , nicknamed ' @entity74 ' , released a mix of shockwaves , heat rays and radiation , killing thousands instantly			1
around 600 to 860 milligrams of matter in the bomb was converted into the active energy of heat and radiation			1
it exploded with an energy between 13 and 18 kilotons of @entity87			2
in comparison , the @entity4 had 9,000 kilotons of explosives on board			2
according to figures published in 1945 , 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the @entity8 blast , and 69,000 were injured			2
by the end of 1945 , the death toll had risen to some 140,000 out of an estimated population of 350,000			2
thousands more died of illness and injuries later			2
three days after the @entity8 attack , on august 9 , 1945 , the @entity2 dropped a second nuclear bomb on the city of @entity103 in southern @entity104			2
@entity104 surrendered six days later , ending the military aggression that brought it into @entity107			2
' its accuracy was horrendous , ' he added			1
' it was one heck of a whopper			0
' we have nothing that comes close to it in the stockpile anymore , and neither does @entity72			1
it 's the end of an era			0
' the @entity4 was designed to destroy facilities deep underground , and it was carried by @entity121 bombers			0
since it was made using older technology by engineers who have since retired or died , developing a disassembly process took time			0
engineers had to develop complex tools and new procedures to ensure safety			0
' we knew going in that this was going to be a challenging project , and we put together an outstanding team with all of our partners to develop a way to achieve this objective safely and efficiently , ' said @entity136 , the plant 's general manager			0
despite being hugely destructive , the 9,000 kiloton @entity4 was by no means the most deadly nuclear weapon @entity2 has built			1
between 1945 and 1990 , more than 70,000 total warheads were developed , in over 65 different varieties , ranging in yield from around .01 kilotons to the 25 megaton @entity143 bomb			0
since the break - up of the @entity45 in 1991 the @entity2 has been steadily reducing its stockpile			0
in april last year , president @entity27 signed a historic treaty with @entity72 leader @entity58 to reduce the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the former @entity37 enemies			1
the landmark agreement in the @entity152 capital @entity153 committed the superpowers to reducing the number of strategic warheads to 1,550 each - 30 per cent lower than the previous cap			0
it also limited the number of deployed launchers - ballistic missiles and heavy bombers - to 700 each			0
many of the @entity164 were disassembled in the 1980s , but a significant number remained in the @entity2 arsenal until they were retired from the stockpile in 1997			0
@entity17 spokesman @entity168 said he could n't comment on how many of the bombs have been disassembled at the @entity19 plant			0
the weapon is considered dismantled when the roughly 300lbs of high explosives inside are separated from the special nuclear material , known as the pit			0
the uranium pits from bombs dismantled at @entity17 will be stored on an interim basis at the plant , @entity175 said			0
the material and components are then processed , which includes sanitising , recycling and disposal , the @entity24 said last autumn when it announced the @entity19 plant 's role in the @entity4 dismantling			0
the plant will play a large role in similar projects as older weapons are retired from the @entity2 's nuclear arsenal .			0

built during the @entity38 in 1962
broken up after talks between @entity27 and @entity72 president @entity58
its accuracy was ' horrendous ' , according to *experts*
