by @entity0 a @entity2 man who died two days after falling from a ladder outside his home had his injuries ' seriously underestimated ' according to an independent report into his death			1
@entity8 died on his 62nd birthday on december 28 2011 , after an accident on @entity11 which left him with eight broken ribs , bleeding in his chest cavity and a collapsed lung			1
according to @entity16 , mr @entity8 went to the @entity17 and @entity18 , part of @entity20 in @entity21 , but was sent home with painkillers after being given a tetanus shot			1
@entity8 had a fall from a ladder in 2011 from which he suffered serious injuries , but when he presented to his local medical centre was just sent home with painkillers the grandfather was said to be in serious pain and had trouble sleeping for the next few nights , and his injuries did not get any better			1
two days later he was at home with family celebrating his birthday when his breathing began to quicken and he turned pale			2
family members gave the man @entity39 while paramedics were on the way but he died before they arrived			0
an independent doctor , @entity43 , who gave advice to the inquest into mr @entity8 's death said the man 's critical injuries were seriously underestimated and the broken ribs were identified as the cause of the internal bleeding and subsequent collapse of his lung			1
dr @entity43 insisted that mr @entity8 's condition should have been more closely noted , and a chest x-ray should have been taken to assess any internal damage			0
in an inquest report released on wednesday , coroner @entity57 said the medical centre 's handling of the situation was partly to blame for mr @entity8 's death			1
the 62 - year - old was taken to @entity63 and @entity18 , part of @entity20 in @entity21 after his accident coroner @entity57 revealed that the medical centre , which the 62 - year - old was taken to in ' extreme pain ' after his accident , was not equipped to deal with such a serious injury , as it had no emergency facilities			0
but , mr @entity57 also noted the devastating outcome that misdiagnosing mr @entity8 's injuries led to , especially since rib and chest injuries are known to be particularly detrimental to older patients			0
the injuries were sustained when the @entity2 man was on a step - ladder sanding his home in @entity83 when he fell into a rocky part of his garden , reported the @entity86			2
the garden was tiered and it is possible he fell onto a garden statue which had sharp parts protruding			0
mr @entity8 was said to be in extreme pain in the two days leading up to his death			0
the doctor who attended to mr @entity8 , dr @entity94 told the coroner he did not x-ray the man 's chest as he did not believe the simple x-ray facilities at the medical centre could have detected the damage			2
however , dr @entity43 disputed this , and said if an x-ray had been taken the extent of his injuries could have been identified and any complications could have been dealt with effectively .			0
