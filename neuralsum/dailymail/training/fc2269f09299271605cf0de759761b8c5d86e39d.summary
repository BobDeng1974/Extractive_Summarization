the @entity3 bid team for the 2018 @entity4 should come clean if they attempted any vote swaps , a former chairman of the @entity1 has said			1
@entity6 , who was also chairman of the 2018 bid until 2010 , said @entity3 should not advocate greater transparency from other countries than it was prepared to apply to itself			1
his comments came as he launched a renewed attack on the world governing body @entity14 during a @entity16 debate on sports governance			2
@entity6 ( left ) pictured alongside prince @entity18 at the @entity20 final between @entity21 and @entity22 in the latest in a string of allegations about the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity26 , won by @entity27 and @entity28 respectively , both countries , along with @entity3 have been accused of breaking @entity14 rules			1
a dossier compiled by the @entity32 and published at the weekend by the @entity34 select committee accused @entity27 and @entity28 of engaging in vote - trading and vote - buying while @entity3 's 2018 bid are alleged to have engineered a failed vote - swap with their counterparts in the @entity42 2022 bid			1
all three organisations have always denied any wrongdoing in their bids to host the tournaments , and a report recently by @entity48 , the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of @entity14 's ethics committee , cleared @entity27 and @entity28 to stage the tournaments			1
the @entity32 claims the allegations it submitted to @entity53 were contained within a database which it says was compiled by @entity3 's 2018 bidding team			1
the chairman of the @entity58 , @entity57 , admitted none of the allegations in the @entity32 dossier had been proven but said they gave the impression of @entity14 being a ' deeply corrupt organisation '			2
after setting out the recent attempts by @entity14 to investigate corruption claims , @entity6 said : ' it would all beggar belief , but not quite enough disbelief in a way			1
@entity6 ( left ) pictured alongside @entity14 president @entity70 ( right ) in @entity71 , @entity72 ' the @entity3 2018 bid team apparently also have a secret dossier with potential evidence of corruption			1
' when asked by mr @entity78 and also i think by the select committee , they said they had no further information			2
' i would love to have seen it			0
it would have gone immediately to mr @entity57 and his committee and they would have been the people to judge whether it was appropriate to move further and not those who really did n't want it to be seen			0
' @entity14 needs root and branch reform			1
its culture will not be changed by tweaking the processes			0
culture is always stronger than process			0
mr ( @entity70 ) @entity70 ( @entity14 president ) and the old school must go			2
his intention to run again is bad for sport			0
' the @entity72 government should be involved , the major sponsors should be involved and i believe the bids for the @entity4 in 2018 and 2022 should be re-run			2
' if @entity3 has anything to say about vote swapping that is not to its credit then let 's come clean as well and not advocate for others what we are not prepared to do for ourselves			1
' @entity6 ( right ) seen alongside former @entity3 manager @entity110 ( right ) at @entity111 setting out the recent situation at @entity14 , @entity6 , a @entity14 peer , said : ' systematic corruption over decades overseen by a group who have been there for decades ; @entity26 awarded by committee nearly half of whom have been compelled to go and some of whom jumped before that point			1
' whistle blowers and investigative journalists disregarded ; no embarrassment quite enough to prompt any action			0
' a senior @entity128 lawyer appointed to investigate but not to see the people who had already been exposed as corrupt , nor to view the huge @entity32 documentation			0
' mr ( @entity132 ) @entity131 writes a long report that is n't to be published			0
a @entity135 lawyer employed by @entity14 writes a summary			2
mr @entity131 denounces it four hours later as inaccurate and defective			0
still no one wants to publish the actual document			0
' candidly , i was surprised to be criticised for not helping mr @entity131 although i was subject to a sub judice restriction because i was being sued by a member of the @entity14 executive for suggesting there might be corruption in that organisation			2
' @entity6 added his voice to calls for @entity131 's ( left ) report into @entity14 ethics to be fully published @entity131 's report has only been published as a summary by @entity14 , something @entity131 himself quickly denounced opening the debate , @entity156 , a former chairman of the @entity157 and sports minister , called for a wide - ranging overhaul of @entity162 sports governance			1
the @entity164 peer has put forward a backbench @entity165 on the issue that would bring in a string of measures aimed at improving the situation			0
' the need for good governance in sport is no less or more than the requirement for @entity176 companies and is essential if we are to protect the interests of athletes in the future , ' he said			0
' only by demonstrating good governance in sport , can governance and @entity162 sports administrators use their influence internationally to good effect			0

@entity6 chaired @entity3 's bid to host the 2018 @entity4 until 2010
he wants @entity3 to ' come clean ' if they attempted to secure vote swaps
@entity6 also said @entity14 needs ' root and branch ' reform
