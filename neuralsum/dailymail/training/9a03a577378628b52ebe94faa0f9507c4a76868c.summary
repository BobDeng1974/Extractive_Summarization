@entity0 last night vowed to strip @entity2 mps of the power to decide policy on health , education and tax rates in @entity8			1
the prime minister said the introduction of ‘ @entity8 votes for @entity8 laws ’ at @entity13 was a matter of ‘ fairness ’ in the wake of @entity2 devolution , and vowed to make it a priority if he wins the election			1
his decision to include income tax rates among the areas on which @entity2 mps will lose the vote could cause havoc for a future @entity28 government , or any administration propped up by the @entity30			2
@entity0 ( left ) intervened following talks with @entity30 leader @entity32 ( right ) in @entity33 on wednesday the intervention followed talks in @entity33 on thursday with @entity30 leader @entity32 , who beforehand had enraged @entity36 @entity24 by threatening to end her party ’s policy of not voting on @entity8 matters at @entity13			1
mr @entity0 described the talks as ‘ businesslike ’ but said @entity2 ’s first minister was ‘ wrong ’ to end the @entity30 ’s bar on voting on devolved matters at @entity13			1
he had travelled to @entity2 to outline a raft of new powers for the @entity33 parliament that were promised in the run - up to last year ’s independence referendum , including tax powers enabling it to raise 60 per cent of its budget			2
@entity2 will also gain control of £ 2.5billion of welfare spending , on top of its existing powers over education , health and justice			0
former @entity28 chancellor @entity60 ( pictured ) warned that barring @entity2 mps from voting on tax would undermine the ‘ fiscal integrity ’ of the @entity63 and it will be able to extend the voting age in @entity2 polls to 16 and 17 - year - olds , in time for the @entity69 election next year			2
miss @entity32 reignited the debate about @entity8 devolution on wednesday by warning the @entity30 would end its ‘ self - denying ordinance ’ on voting on matters such as health at @entity13			1
the move was seen as paving the way for a post-election deal in which the @entity30 could prop up a minority labour government in return for more powers and cash for @entity2			2
it also helps to neutralise @entity28 ’s central message north of the border that a vote for the @entity30 risks a @entity36 government at @entity13			1
yesterday mr @entity0 indicated there would be no further devolution to @entity2 , describing the new powers as ‘ the resting place ’ for the issue , while the @entity30 said the proposals did not go far enough			1
he made clear that the new powers for @entity2 will come in parallel with a reduction in the voting rights of @entity2 mps			0
he also suggested the issue would be a ‘ red line ’ in any coalition talks , pledging to act on it if he remains as prime minister			0
he said : ‘ you will get in full these [ devolution ] measures , set out in a @entity105 in the first @entity106 of any government i lead			0
' but there will also be very clearly set - out rules put in place so that @entity8 @entity24 have the decisive say on issues that only affect @entity8			0
' i think that is fair and right			0
’ mr @entity0 also said the proposals would prevent @entity2 mps having a decisive say on income tax rates in @entity8 – potentially making it difficult for a future @entity28 government to pass its budgets			1
he said : ‘ it would n’t be appropriate for @entity8 constituents to have a rate of tax essentially imposed on them by @entity2 @entity24			0
’ mr @entity0 said the @entity36 would set out their proposals on the issue ‘ within days ’			0
options include a complete ban on @entity2 mps voting on @entity8 matters , and the introduction of a separate parliamentary stage on which they would be excluded – effectively giving @entity8 mps a veto			1
former @entity28 chancellor @entity60 warned that barring @entity2 mps from voting on tax would undermine the ‘ fiscal integrity ’ of the @entity63			0
he said : ‘ we must do nothing in any reforms that ... undermine the fiscal integrity of the @entity63 because if we do that we will end up with all the structures we see in the eurozone , which no one wants to see			0

@entity149 says introducing ' @entity8 votes for @entity8 laws ' at @entity13 was a matter of ' fairness ' in wake of @entity2 devolution
