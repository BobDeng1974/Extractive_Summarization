by @entity0 @entity1 is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars			1
but the @entity8 - founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			2
at the weekend , the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising , claiming ‘ we need to be super careful with @entity16			1
potentially more dangerous than nukes			0
’ over the weekend , the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at such scenarios , claiming ' we need to be super careful with @entity16			1
potentially more dangerous than nukes ' @entity1 referred to the book ‘ @entity29 , strategies ’ , a work by @entity25 that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers			1
mr @entity25 has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation			2
in a later tweet , @entity1 wrote : ‘ hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			1
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
’ @entity1 's tweets follows a similar comment in june in which the @entity8 - founder said believes that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity16 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			1

@entity65 ’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘ computer that thinks like a person … except it does n’t have to eat or sleep ’ , according to the company 's co-founder @entity75			1
in an interview with @entity78 , @entity1 said : ‘ i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there			1
’ ‘ there have been movies about this , you know , like @entity86 , ’ @entity1 continued			1
‘ there are some scary outcomes			0
and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good , not bad			0
’ 42 - year - old @entity1 ( pictured ) is so worried , he is investing in @entity16 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand in an interview with @entity78 earlier this year , @entity1 said : ' i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there			1

pictured is a scene from @entity86 @entity108 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			0
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity114 , a @entity116 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			0
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity127 ’s @entity126 said in a recent interview			0
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity16 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			1
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity139 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
neuroscientist @entity141 , 37 , founded @entity127 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
@entity65 is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain ’s neocortex			2
the neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals			0
it is around 3mm thick and has six layers , each involved with various functions			0
these include sensory perception , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and language in humans			0
according to the company ’s website : ‘ @entity65 is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain			1
‘ our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans			2
‘ powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the @entity178			2
’ in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘ reliably ’ solves modern @entity181 - the world ’s most widely used test of a machine ’s ability to act human			1
captchas are used when filling in forms , for example , to make sure it ’s not being completed by a bot			0
this prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets , for example			0
in march , @entity1 made an investment in @entity67 - based @entity16 group @entity65 , along with @entity199 founder @entity68 ( right ) and actor @entity69 ( left ) as well as @entity65 , @entity1 was early investor in @entity16 firm @entity127 , which was earlier this year acquired by @entity108 for £ 400m ( $ 678m )			1
professor @entity201 has also warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			2
earlier this year , the renowned physicist discusses @entity210 's latest film @entity208 , which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans			2
professor @entity201 said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘ worst mistake in history ’			2
@entity201 has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind			0
' success in creating @entity16 would be the biggest event in human history , ' he said writing in the @entity228			2
' unfortunately , it might also be the last '			0

@entity231 tweeted by @entity1 while recommending a book by @entity25
the book ' @entity29 : paths , dangers , strategies ’ , asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers
@entity1 *previously* said ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from @entity16
42 - year - old is so worried that he said his investment in @entity16 group , @entity65 , was *purely* to keep an eye on the technology rather than make money
