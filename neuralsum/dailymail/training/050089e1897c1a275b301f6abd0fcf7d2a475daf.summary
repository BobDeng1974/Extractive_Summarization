by @entity0 @entity1 lost 11st following gastric bypass surgery			1
but she was left with unsightly folds of excess skin around her tummy and waist a morbidly obese grandmother who shed 11 stone has been awarded a six - figure settlement after botched surgery to remove unsightly folds of excess skin left her in agonising pain			1
@entity1 was warned she would not live to see her grandchildren grow up , after ballooning to 26st			1
the 45 - year - old was delighted to drop eight dress sizes			1
but following her gastric bypass , the community care worker was left with mounds of sagging skin around her abdomen and waist			1
the @entity24 agreed to a further operation to remove the excess skin			1
but mrs @entity1 's delight soon turned to despair , when surgeons removed too much skin causing an infection to ravage her body leaving her in constant pain			1
the grandmother - of - four , from @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' i decided to start losing weight as i knew that my health was starting to suffer and it was important to me to see my grandchildren grow up			1
' i underwent the surgery on the advice of my doctor and was living a healthy lifestyle			0
' but when you lose a lot of weight you end up with a lot of excess skin , so i was put forward for an operation to remove it			1
' i was told the procedure was simple and never imagined anything could go wrong - never mind be left in constant agony with horrific scars			0
' my main motivation throughout this whole ordeal was the thought of being able to play with my grandchildren			0
' but i 'm now in a situation which is even worse than before			0
it ’s a living nightmare			0
' i feel embarrassed by my body , i look horrendous and the scarring is beyond what i could have imagined in my worst nightmares			0
' however the worst part is the pain			0
i ca n’t stand or sit down without extreme pain so playing with my grandchildren is impossible			0
' doctors have told me there is nothing they can do to help me so i am going to have to suffer with this for the rest of my life			0
' mrs @entity1 has since received a six - figure pay out from @entity74			1
she was admitted to the @entity75 in august 2007 for a gastric bypass operation , having reached 26st			1
it was a success , allowing the community care worker to shed 15st			1
but in january 2009 , plagued by the unsightly skin left in the wake of the weight - loss surgery , doctors advised mrs @entity1 she would need a lower body lift and tummy tuck			1
she went into the operating theatre on august 18 , 2009			0
following surgery to remove the excess skin , mrs @entity1 suffered an infection which caused severe blisters and chronic agonising pain twelve operations later and mrs @entity1 said she is still suffering agonising pain in her buttocks and lower back , causing her difficulty standing or sitting			1
doctors have said there is nothing more they can do for the grandmother - of - four but after waking up and findings severe blisters and deeply bruised skin on her behind , she was immediately concerned			2
days after the procedure , she began to feel worse and was diagnosed with epidermolysis - a skin condition which results in serious blistering of the skin			2
despite her condition failing to improve , she was discharged ten days later , only to be readmitted the next day after her wounds began to ooze and her temperature soared			0
mrs @entity1 was taken into surgery and underwent two operations to remove ‘ undermined areas ’ from the first procedure - consisting of two huge sections of dead tissue from her buttocks			1
but this failed to solve the problem - leading to a further nine operations including multiple skin grafts , fluid drainage and tummy tucks			2
mrs @entity1 was warned she would not live to see her grandchildren grow up after ballooning to 26st , pictured twelve operations later and mrs @entity1 said she is still suffering agonising pain in her buttocks and lower back , causing her difficulty standing or sitting			1
she said : ' i thought i was doing the right thing by losing the weight as i wanted to be healthier so i could play with my grandchildren			2
' but now i am in a much worse situation than before			2
' the doctors had scheduled in future operations for the removal of excess skin on my arms and thighs , but i just ca n’t have any more surgery as i am worried about the consequences			2
' mrs @entity1 instructed law firm @entity139 to launch legal action against @entity74			2
she said : ' my life has been turned upside down since the operation			0
there are so many things i used to take for granted that i simply ca n’t do anymore			0
' the settlement will allow me to make alterations to my house and prepare for a future with the horrendous injuries i will now have to live with for the rest of my life			0
' @entity151 , clinical negligence lawyer at @entity139 , said : ' @entity1 will be in lifelong pain			0
' this compensation will allow her to fund a comprehensive and coordinated program of pain management and psychological support			0
' she will also be able to implement a care regime and adapt her home to regain her independence			0
' @entity1 has been imprisoned by her debilitating pain and is unlikely to work again , but this result goes some way to restore her quality of life			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity74 told @entity165 : ' we are sorry that mrs @entity1 experienced difficulties with the recognised complications of surgery , which she underwent in 2009			1
' we investigated the matter thoroughly and , whilst we have not admitted liability , we are pleased to have reached a mutually agreed settlement			2
