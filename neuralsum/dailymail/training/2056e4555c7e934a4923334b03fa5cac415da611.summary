by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 6 november 2013 she 's one of the last people living on a boarded - up street and she 's holding up a massive £ 650million regeneration project			1
but , after living there for 30 years , grandmother @entity5 wo n't budge from her home in @entity8 unless she 's paid the market value			1
now council bosses in @entity8 , @entity11 , have had to apply for a legal order to force the 55 - year - old from her two - bedroom house so she can make way for the wrecking ball			1
standing firm : council officials have applied for a legal order to force @entity5 ( pictured ) from her two - bedroom house mrs @entity5 , and husband @entity20 , 65 , had agreed in principle to move into a new three - bedroom house nearby - one of 1,500 being built under the @entity25 scheme			1
negotiations stalled though over the value of their home , one of the last in @entity30 in @entity31 , after @entity32 , @entity8 council 's regeneration arm , made a ' final offer ' of £ 68,000			1
the couple , who bought the home for £ 9,500 under right - to - buy rules and have spent £ 10,000 doing it up , believe the house is worth £ 80,000 to 90,000			1
mrs @entity5 , a supermarket worker , @entity20 , a scaffolder , are the last owner - occupiers on the condemned street not to have put pen to paper			1
boarded - up : the houses in @entity47 , @entity8 , where a £ 650million regeneration project is set to transform the area mrs @entity5 , and husband @entity20 , 65 , had agreed in principle to move into a new three - bedroom house nearby before negotiations stalled over the price of their home the ' right to buy ' scheme has resulted in the sale of around two million council homes since the scheme was launched in 1980 under @entity59			1
initially , councils were obliged to use sales revenue to pay off debts before building new properties , which reduced the availability of council housing			0
last year @entity66 proposed raising ' right to @entity68 ' discounts to help boost the housing market and generate finance to build new homes			0
qualifying tenants must live in self - contained properties which are main homes , rented from a public sector landlord for at least five years			0
those who have previously lived in a now - sold council home could also be eligible for ' preserved right to buy '			2
tenants are offered a maximum discount of 60 per cent for a house and 70 per cent for a flat , saving up to £ 75,000 on the value of their home			2
they will have to repay the discount if the property is resold within five years , while homes resold within ten years must be offered back to a local authority			0
now council papers reveal officials are to apply for a so - called compulsory purchase order , which would legally require them to move if they do n't reach an agreement			2
mrs @entity5 , a grandmother of one , said : ' other people living here just took whatever they were offered and moved out straight away - they were just looking for a quick deal and some of the houses were n't in terribly good condition			2
' but we have put a lot into this house and feel it has been undervalued			0
' the couple expect to move into their new £ 125,000 three - bedroom home , partly financed by a low - interest equity loan from @entity32 , once a deal has been reached			0
a @entity8 council spokesman said : ' residents in the @entity110 clearance area , part of the creating a @entity31 project , were offered the right to reserve a new @entity114 together home when they are completed , beginning in spring 2014			1
' additionally , support has been provided in the form of housing advice and financial compensation , including relocation equity loans to help with the move to a new home			0
' all remaining occupiers on the @entity110 estate have agreed to move into the @entity31 together new homes available from spring 2014			0
' it is a matter of course that a @entity128 would be prepared for projects on a scale as large as this , to ensure the project can be completed on time			0
' however , all residents in the @entity110 estate have agreed to move to the new homes , which means it is unlikely that the council would look to use this measure			0

the street @entity5 lives on is part of a regeneration project
her home has to be *bulldozed* to make way for the £ 650m scheme
but @entity8 is offering her less than she thinks it is worth
mrs @entity149 is digging her heels in and holding up the project
now council officials have applied for an order to force her out
