by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 09:26 est , 6 august 2013 the @entity1 has definitively linked climate change to humanity ’s reliance on fossil fuels			1
in a statement , the @entity1 said that humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years			1
it claimed that human - caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8 ° @entity13 ) over the past 140 years			1
the @entity1 claims that human - caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8 ° c over the past 140 years ' there is only one thing that is going straight up … that is the greenhouse gases that we are just pumping at an exponential rate , ' @entity16 , an atmospheric scientist at @entity17 who chaired the committee responsible for the statement , told @entity24			1
‘ extensive , independent observations confirm the reality of global warming , ’ said the statement			1
‘ these changes are broadly consistent with long understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human - caused increases in greenhouse gases			0
‘ the changes are inconsistent with explanations of climate change that rely on known natural influences			0
’ the union said the consequences of continuing on this path include deforestation , urbanisation , and particulate pollution which can have complex geographical , seasonal , and longer - term effects on temperature			0
it added that there is time to lessen the impact by cutting emissions and preparing for changes that are unavoidable			0
the union said the consequences of continuing to burn fossil fuels include deforestation , urbanisation , and particulate pollution which can have complex geographical , seasonal , and longer - term effects on temperature the @entity1 is an organisation with over 62,000 members of @entity56 and space scientists who come from 144 countries			2
a 15 - person panel reviewed and updated the position statement - a task which is done every four years			2
however , one committee member , @entity62 , who is a retired professor of atmospheric sciences at @entity64 , opposed the statement			0
speaking to @entity68 climate scientist @entity67 , @entity66 said the statement was an inaccurate view of climate change dominated by the emission of carbon dioxide and a few other greenhouse gases			1
he said that during the review process , other views were never given an adequate opportunity to be discussed			0
the @entity1 claims that there is time to lessen the impact by cutting emissions and preparing for changes that are unavoidable ‘ the natural @entity56 ’s climate system , even in the absence of humans , is nonlinear in which forcings and response are not necessarily proportional , ’ said @entity66 , offering his own explanation			1
‘ thus change is often episodic and abrupt , rather than slow and gradual			0
’ @entity66 said that climate change is the result of both human and natural changes			2
he concluded : ‘ the relative role of each in altering atmospheric and ocean circulation features , and even the global annual average radiative forcing , however , is still uncertain			2
’ @entity101 scientists claim the planet is undergoing one of the largest changes in climate in the past 65 million @entity106 at @entity107 have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct.if the trend continues at its current rapid pace , it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world , and many species will need to make behavioral , evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive , they said.the findings come from a review of climate research by @entity56 system science expert @entity124 and @entity125 , a professor of environmental @entity56 system science and the director of the @entity128 at the institution .			0

the @entity1 *believes* humans are responsible for a global average surface warming of 0.8 ° c over the past 140 years
*eminent* scientist @entity66 , who was involved in putting the statement together , claims this view is inaccurate as not enough data is available
