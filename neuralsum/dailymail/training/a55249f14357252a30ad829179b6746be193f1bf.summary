a new social hotspot is taking @entity1 by storm this @entity3 , offering up effective hangover cures to ailing revelers - from inside a bus			1
the suitably - named @entity7 is a mobile lounge in which sore - headed party - goers can seek sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of @entity13 , while also enjoying a vitamin - infused iv drip which promises to rid them of all their hangover symptoms			1
created by @entity1 - based company the @entity17 , the bus , which will be stationed outside of popular nightspot @entity20 21st street until 7pm this evening , comes complete with a team of trained nurses who administer the drips and offer additional medical advice to anyone who needs it			1
' people do drink and unfortunately sometimes we go a little overboard and the aftermath is feeling very dehydrated ... essentially , what your body needs is cellular hydration			0
' the iv fluid is going directly into your bloodstream and replenishing the thirsty cells in your body			0
' the iv drips - which can also be infused with painkillers and anti-nausea medication at the nurses ' discretion - do n't come cheap , however			1
according to the @entity64 , the drips , which take about 40 minutes , are being offered at a discount on the bus			2
@entity69 , which includes hydration and nausea or pain medication , is priced at $ 129 ( full price $ 175 ) , the @entity67 , which also includes a vitamin b booster , is $ 149 ( full price $ 219 ) and the @entity73 , which contains a detox and vitamin c booster is a whopping $ 169 ( full price & 249 )			0
drip life : prior to launching the @entity7 , the company delivered custom iv drips to its clients at their homes anyone with a slightly smaller budget can also opt for a half - bag option , which costs $ 79			1
and it 's not just iv drips that the bus is serving up			0
customers are also given free access to @entity90 , where they can enjoy a selection of @entity3 football , screenings of @entity94 and a variety of delicious hangover foods such as mac and cheese , @entity100 truffle fries and pigs - in - pretzels			0
given that the bus can only fit 15 people inside at any one time - although it is equipped with enough iv drips to serve more than 200 hangover sufferers - the space of the nearby nightclub will no doubt come in handy			2
