britons lacking motivation for that overdue health kick might find themselves hitting the gym after - rather than before - their summer holiday			1
more than half of dieters are spurred on to embark on a weight loss mission after witnessing less than flattering holiday snaps , a new study finds			1
in fact , the holiday photo album has been named the number one motivation behind @entity15 weight loss ahead of a relationship break - up and being unable to fit into clothes			1
holiday photos are the top motivation behind @entity15 weight loss ( picture posed by model ) comments from a partner were the second most common form of motivation , with unflattering photos from nights out coming in third			1
interestingly , those spurred on to diet after seeing their bikini snaps actually lost more weight than those motivated by any other reason			1
more than 2,100 @entity15 people took part in the online survey , all of whom were aged 18 and over and on a diet at the time of the poll			1
initially , respondents were asked ' what first motivated you to lose weight ? ' and provided with a list of answers , with the opportunity to select as many answers as were relevant to their decision to embark on their diet			1
you 're likely to be pictured in swimwear so there 's no escaping any extra weight ( posed by model ) the survey then asked respondents how much weight they had lost , on average , per month during their diet , finding that an average dieting @entity65 loses around 3lbs per month			1
unflattering holiday photos – 51 per cent 2			2
comments from partner – 46 per cent 3			2
unflattering photos from nights out – 43 per cent 4			0
being unable to fit into clothes – 41 per cent 5			0
a relationship break up – 38 per cent 6			0

comments from friends & family – 29 per cent 8			0
worried about embarrassing children / family – 24 per cent 9			0
recommendation by doctor – 17 per cent 10			0
realising you 're unable to see certain body parts when naked – 15 per cent a spokesperson for online pharmacy specialising in weight loss treatments , @entity84 , who commissioned the survey , said : ' i think most of us have seen pictures of ourselves at one point or another and cringed , perhaps at an outfit , a hairstyle or , possibly worst of all , a few extra pounds we 'd gained without realising it			0
' when you 're on holiday , you 're likely to be pictured in skimpier clothing and swimwear , so there 's no escaping any extra weight			2
although it 's not nice to see initially and can come as a bit of a shock , eventually the dieter will be grateful for the inspiration			0
