police are blasting five people a day with 50,000 - volt taser guns as use of the controversial weapons has soared			2
new figures show the stun - guns – which deliver a powerful electric shock to incapacitate the target – were drawn , aimed or fired a record number of times in the last year			1
@entity12 data showed tasers were used 10,488 times in the 12 months to the end of june – a 13 per cent increase compared with the 9,289 on the previous year			1
police have blasted five people a day with controversial 50,000 volt @entity13 guns , new figures have revealed over that period , police zapped 1693 people with @entity13 – equivalent to shooting five people every day			2
a detailed breakdown shows that between january and june this year , 826 people were shot with the supposedly non-lethal weapons			2
police used @entity13 on 5,107 occasions over the six - month span			0
this was up one - third – 32 per cent – on the same period in 2012 and use has quadrupled since they were initially deployed 1,267 times in the first half of 2009			1
senior officers insist tasers are used as a weapon of last resort , when there is such a severe threat of violence that force is needed to protect the public , police or a culprit			1
but critics have accused the police of using them as a ‘ compliance tool ’ – and claim this is proved by the relentless rise in their use			1
concern is mounting that ten people have died after being tasered since the controversial guns were introduced a decade ago			0
last week the @entity50 told how five police officers involved in an incident in which an innocent man was shot dead with a @entity13 have demanded their identities are kept secret at his inquest			1
ice cream factory worker @entity58 , 23 , from @entity60 , @entity61 , had a suspected heart attack after being hit with the stun gun outside his terraced house after a disturbance with his neighbours in july last year			0
an unknown man being tasered and then arrested by officers in @entity69 , in @entity70 in march , a policeman was ordered to apologise to a blind man after he shot him with a taser in @entity74 , @entity75 , in 2012			0
the officer said he thought the victim ’s white stick was a samurai sword			0
and the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) is investigating the use of the stun guns on three boys with severe learning difficulties , aged 14 and 15 , after reports of a violent incident at a school near @entity88 last year			0
the @entity80 has admitted it has ‘ serious reservations ’ about when officers are using the weapons			0
complaints from the public have soared amid suspicion the police are often using tasers without proper justification			1
@entity58 , 23 , from @entity60 , @entity61 , had a suspected heart attack after being hit with the stun gun outside his terraced house after a disturbance with his neighbours in july last year a taser is recorded as ‘ used ’ when an officer draws it from its holster			0
in the first six months of the year , @entity13 were used in their ‘ red dot ’ mode – when a laser beam illuminated a target – on 2,636 occasions , or 52 per cent			1
tasers were also used to stun a target – like an electric cattle prod – on 123 occasions in @entity117 and @entity118			0
@entity119 , of @entity120 , said : ‘ what these figures do n’t tell you is when and why police officers have drawn these highly dangerous electro - shock weapons more than 10,000 times in the past 12 months			1
‘ we ’re not against @entity13 if used by specially - trained police officers trying to prevent a death or a serious injury , but we simply do n’t know the circumstances in which people are being fired at with these potentially lethal weapons			1
’ a police officer demonstrates how to use a taser gun - the weapon was used on 1.693 people in 12 months but commander @entity138 , the @entity13 spokesman for the @entity139 , said : ‘ officers who are selected to carry @entity13 have a proven track record of policing			1
‘ @entity13 is not a panacea to all occasions when police officers need to use force and will only be used in situations where officers face violence or the threat of violence			2
tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and @entity157 gas			2
they have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across @entity117 and @entity118 since they were introduced in 2004			0
police use a @entity161 manufactured £ 500 @entity163 model which fires a 50,000 - volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal @entity168 has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably			0
‘ while this is a vital weapon for police to have at their disposal for incidents which pose a risk to the public , police or the alleged perpetrator , it is not something that we use lightly and the incidence of a full discharge remains very low			2
’ he said tasers were used on fewer than one per cent of those arrested			2
@entity139 said @entity13 posed ‘ significantly less risk ’ than other methods used by the police such as metal batons , police dogs or @entity157 spray			0
police say the rise in the use of @entity13 mirrors the increase in the number of the weapons available to forces – more than 5,500 – and more trained officers			1
but the @entity199 , which represents rank - and - file officers , has fuelled alarm by suggesting every single policeman or woman , around 130,000 , should have a @entity13 .			0
