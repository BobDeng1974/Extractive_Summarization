@entity1 secret services may have executed the troops suspected of shooting down @entity5 flight @entity3 , say sources involved in the investigation of the crash over eastern @entity9			1
the @entity11 - led probe is leaning towards a conclusion that a @entity14 missile fired from rebel - held territory downed the @entity17 , killing all 298 on board			1
and it is highly likely the aircraft was shot out of the sky by @entity1 military personnel , according to a report by the @entity11 ' state broadcaster @entity24 , citing anonymous sources in the police and the group of investigators working on the probe into the plane 's loss			1
those who allegedly shot the missiles at the @entity17 have been ' untraceable ' for investigators , it is claimed			0
' so in the end there may be no trial , unfortunately , just the report on the results of the investigation , ' he added			0
sources close to the investigation also complain they are under siege from persistent attempts by @entity1 secret services to hack their computer system and plant spyware software on their smartphones , reported @entity24 phones and laptops used by investigators in @entity9 had to be ' destroyed ' subsequently because they were infected with spyware , it was claimed			1
even home communications devices of police officers on the investigation were removed because they were ' contaminated ' , it was alleged			0
the long - awaited probe into the crash of flight @entity37 is not due to unveil its findings until october , but @entity24 says its claims are based on ' several anonymous sources in the police and the group of investigators '			0
@entity1 has strongly and repeatedly denied any role in shooting down @entity3 , and also dismissed claims that the aircraft was hit by @entity96 rebels			0
denial : @entity1 president @entity98 ( pictured ) blamed @entity9 for obstructing investigators from the crash site - and @entity101 has repeatedly denied any involvement in the plane 's destruction damage : @entity1 media has said th holes in the plane 's fuselage are not consistent with the damage caused by a @entity14 missile , which investigators believe could be the reason for its demise yet the evidence ' points in one direction ' , namely a ground - based attack by a @entity14 missile , it was claimed in @entity11			1
despite this , the official probe - which has examined more than one million documents , videos and photographs - has not so far ruled out other versions on the downing of the plane			2
' it is a leading version now but not the only one , they are still investigating the other options , ' said the journalist			0
investigators were hampered at the crash site by fighting in the region between @entity96 rebels and the @entity9 army			0
the @entity1 media has highlighted claims that @entity3 was hit by a @entity9 warplane in the vicinity at the time of the crash on 17 july 2014			2
doomed : according to @entity9 intelligence chief @entity142 , this was a picture of a missile being fired from @entity144 in @entity9 towards the @entity37 flight aftermath : sources investigating the root of @entity37 's destruction ( pictured ) complain the @entity150 is ' persistently ' trying to hack their computers a suspected ' executioner ' - a @entity9 air force pilot - was even named			1
western secret services have also been blamed			0
yesterday , @entity1 newspaper @entity154 cited an expert saying that the holes in the fuselage of the crashed plane did not match the damage normally caused by a @entity14 missile			2
' at least 9 holes were found which are typical for the damage from an ' air - to - air ' missile , suggesting that @entity3 was shot from a plane			2
while @entity168 governments have pointed towards a @entity14 system being responsible for downing the @entity17 on 17 july 2014 , such a conclusion by an international air crash investigation would be a devastating blow for @entity101 .			1

it is highly likely the aircraft was destroyed by ' @entity14 ' *surface* - to - air missile
@entity1 military could have shot it down from a rebel - held area in @entity9
investigators say shooters are ' untraceable ' and may have been executed
more than one million documents , videos and photo 's have been looked at
