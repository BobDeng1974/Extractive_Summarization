@entity0 has been accused of stoking ' kneejerk xenophobia ' by a @entity3 commissioner over his ' unintelligent ' accusations of benefit tourism among @entity7 migrants			1
responding to the @entity14 's speech last week in which he vowed to restrict access to housing benefits and the @entity17 for those coming to the @entity19 under @entity7 free - movement rules , the @entity3 commissioner for employment , social affairs and inclusion , @entity12 , told the @entity21 his claims were misleading			1
' there is a serious risk of pandering to knee - jerk xenophobia , ' he said			0
' blaming poor people or migrants for hardships at the time of economic crisis is not entirely unknown , but it is not intelligent politics in my view			0
@entity0 has come under attack from @entity36 commissioner @entity12 ( right ) over his plans to restrict access to benefits to migrants from @entity3			1
mr @entity12 said the crackdown was ' unintelligent ' ' i think it would be more responsible to confront mistaken perceptions about immigration from other @entity7 countries and so - called " benefit tourism " , and instead to explain the facts			1
' the reality is that migrants from other @entity7 countries are very beneficial to the @entity19 's economy , notably because they help to address skills shortages and pay more tax and social security contributions per head , and get fewer benefits , than @entity19 workers ; that free movement of workers is a key part of the single market ; that hundreds of thousands of @entity19 nationals work in other @entity7 countries			2
' the blistering response suggests mr @entity0 , who pledged to tighten residency tests for migrants from the @entity7 and the wider @entity67 , is heading for a confrontation with @entity69 if and when he tries to secure agreement for such an approach with other member states			1
@entity3 law says that before @entity7 citizens who are ' not active in the labour market ' become eligible for social security benefits , they have to pass a strict ' habitual residence test ' proving they have a genuine link with the @entity19			0
@entity69 says the tests are stringent at all levels and existing rules , agreed by the @entity19 , prevent benefit tourism			1
the current tests are already the subject of legal disagreements between the @entity19 government and the commission , which believes there are cases in which the @entity19 is already breaching @entity7 law , the paper reports			0
former @entity3 commissioner and @entity96 cabinet minister @entity94 - now co-president of a cross-party campaign to promote a positive role for the @entity19 in @entity3 called @entity100 - also rejected the idea that citizens from @entity7 states come here to ' sponge '			2
he said @entity19 needed workers when economic times were good and said the country would have to attract them again in the future , and added a similar number of @entity19 left the country to work in @entity3			0
critic : former cabinet minister @entity94 also weighed into the row , warning mr @entity113 relies on immigrants from @entity3 for economic prosperity in his speech , widely seen as a response to the rise of @entity119 , mr @entity0 said ' ending the something - for - nothing culture is something that needs to apply in the immigration system as well as in the welfare system '			1
he pledged that ' by the end of this year and before the controls on @entity126 and @entity127 are lifted , we are going to strengthen the test that determines which migrants can access benefits '			0
he also said : ' we 're going to give migrants from the @entity67 - from the @entity67 - a very clear message			0
just like @entity19 citizens , there is no absolute right to unemployment benefit			2
' the clue is in the title : jobseeker 's allowance is only available to those who are genuinely seeking a job			0
' mr @entity12 added the commission had asked the @entity19 government on many occasions for evidence but none had been forthcoming .			2

@entity14 *blasted* for his ' unintelligent ' plans to restrict *handouts* for migrants
mr @entity0 on *collision* course with @entity69 over crackdown
@entity94 also rejects notion of ' benefit tourists ' and *insists* immigrants benefit @entity19 economy
