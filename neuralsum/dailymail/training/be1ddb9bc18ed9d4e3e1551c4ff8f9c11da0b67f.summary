@entity5 , 62 , from @entity6 , had gender reassignment surgery more than a decade ago and takes a daily dose of doctor - prescribed synthetic oestrogen			1
after noticing an unusual breast growth , ms @entity5 , who does not have health insurance , went to the @entity15 centre in @entity16 for a mammogram			1
but ms @entity5 was shocked to be told she could not have the mammogram because she was not born a woman			1

' i have the same hopes , the same dreams , the same concerns as any other woman , ' she added			0
after noticing an odd breast growth , ms @entity5 , who does n't have health insurance , went to the @entity15 centre in @entity16 for a mammogram but was turned away for not being a woman ms @entity5 said that her daily intake of sex hormone estradiol had increased her risk of developing a variety of tumours , including breast cancer , and believed her growth warranted further investigation			1
a spokesman for @entity54 , which funds the programme , said it only covers clients who are ' genetically female '			0
but ms @entity5 countered that after nearly 50 years of living as a male , it had not been an ' authentic ' life and now describes herself as ' a real woman '			2
' it 's discrimination based on her transgender status			0
i think that 's pretty black and white , ' her attorney , @entity67 said			0
ms @entity67 filed the lawsuit , claiming ms @entity5 's experience was in violation of the @entity71 , adding it was a ' terrible injustice '			1
legal analyst @entity72 is now arguing for legislation as federal law on transgender issues is not clear enough			0
ms @entity5 has since raised the money to pay for a mammogram - and has found she does not have breast cancer			1
her legal crusade continues , though , as she does not want others in a similar situation to be denied such screenings , and wants to hold public organisations accountable			2

the specifics of the lawsuit have not been reported			0
no one from @entity54 was available for comment due to the partial government shutdown			0
