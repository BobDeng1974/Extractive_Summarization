by @entity1 reporter published : 12:07 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 16:33 est , 24 may 2013 composer : singer - songwriter @entity3 wrote controversial hit @entity5 , @entity5 the @entity6 investigated the classic song ' @entity5 ' for two years , it has been revealed			1
the intelligence agency was tasked with analysing the song to see if it contained hidden obscene language as part of their work tackling obscenity , the @entity8 reported			1
the song , sung by the @entity18 , has notoriously mumbled lyrics that are difficult to make out			2
but according to @entity6 files , a teacher from @entity21 , in @entity22 , wrote to them in february 1964 to insist something was done to ' stamp out this menace '			1
the teacher , whose name has been redacted from the files , said : ' who do you turn to when your teenage daughter buys and bring home pornographic or obscene materials being sold along with objects directed and aimed at the teenage market in every @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 shop in this @entity39 ? ' my daughter brought home a record of ‘ @entity5 ‘ and i , after reading that the record had been banned from being played on the air because it was obscene , proceeded to try to decipher the jumble of words			1
the lyrics are so filthy that i can - not enclose them in this letter … ' @entity5 , @entity5 , me got ta go			2
@entity5 , @entity5 , me got ta go			2
a fine little girl , she wait for me ; me catch a ship across the sea			0
i sailed the ship all alone ; i never think i ’ll make it home three nights and days we sailed the sea ; me think of girl constantly			0
on the ship , i dream she there ; i smell the rose , in her hair			0
me see @entity67 moon above ; it wo n’t be long me see me love			0
me take her in my arms and then i tell her i never leave again			0
he added : ' we all know there is obscene materials available for those who seek it but when they start sneaking in this material in the guise of the latest teen age rock & roll hit record these morons have gone too far			2
' the suggested lyrics , which are too explicit to publish , are featured in the @entity6 report			1
a cover letter addressed to the @entity6 laboratory which analysed the song described it as ' a calypso - type song ' that was ' very popular with the high school students '			1
it added : ' the words are hard to recognise			0
' analysts spent two years playing the record at different speeds but were unable to come to a decision on what the words were			1
they never contacted the original singer @entity98 for confirmation , the @entity8 reported			0
instead , they concluded : ' the lyrics of the song on this record was not definitely determined by this @entity105 examination , it was not possible to determine whether this recording is obscene			1
' ' dirty ' versions of the tune have appeared in popular culture including the film @entity110 .			0
