by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 23 april 2013 @entity2 : 01:51 est , 24 april 2013 tensions between @entity4 and @entity5 sparked by a row over a group of disputed islands have deepened after a flotilla of boats carrying @entity4 activists sailed in nearby waters			1
the @entity5 foreign ministry has said that it has lodged ' stern representations ' with @entity4 after 10 boats carrying 80 activists was seen close to the islands , known as the @entity18 in @entity4 and the @entity18 in @entity5 , in the @entity19			1
eight @entity5 government ships are also said to have sailed in the vicinity of the islands			2
tense : relations between the two countries were damaged further when @entity5 reacted with anger after politicians and lawmakers paid a visit to a @entity4 war memorial which honours 14 war criminals pilgrimage : a large party of lawmakers visited the @entity34 site after the @entity4 prime minister made an offering over the weekend disputed : tensions between @entity4 and @entity5 over a group of disputed islands in the @entity19 ( pictured ) have erupted again after a flotilla of boats carrying @entity4 activists was seen in nearby waters @entity4 's tetchy relationship with its neighbour was also further tested after @entity5 chastised after around 170 @entity4 lawmakers visited a shrine to the country 's war dead			1
the @entity50 - which pays homage to 14 leaders convicted as war criminals by an @entity55 tribunal - is seen as a symbol of @entity4 's militarism by both @entity5 and @entity58			1
the pilgrimage came after prime minister @entity60 made an offering and deputy prime minister @entity62 and two other ministers visited the shrine over the weekend			0
@entity5 foreign ministry spokesman @entity66 said in a news conference : ' regarding the @entity4 right - wing activists ' illegal entry into the waters of the @entity18 islands that is causing trouble , the @entity5 foreign ministry has lodged stern representations with @entity4 , and has strongly protested			1
disputed : the location of the islands in the @entity19 contentious : last year members of the same group , known as ' @entity79 ' ( @entity80 ! @entity4 ) , landed on one of the rocky islets and triggered @entity84 protests in @entity5 , where lingering resentment over @entity4 's wartime aggression has been rekindled @entity4 's tetchy relationship with its neighbour was also further tested after @entity5 chastised after around 170 @entity4 lawmakers visited a shrine to the country 's war dead			1
' regardless of what method or what identity these @entity4 leaders take in visiting @entity50 , fundamentally it is intentionally denying @entity4 's militaristic invasionist history			2
' ' we urge @entity4 to be responsible to history , to be responsible to the people and take a responsible attitude to the future and take realistic actions to win the trust of the international community , stop causing harm to itself and stop isolationist measures			0
' while @entity5 officials sternly warned @entity4 about the nationalist 's activity close to the disputed islands , @entity4 itself protested at what it called an intrusion by eight @entity5 patrol vessels into its waters near the uninhabited islands , which are near rich fishing grounds and potentially lucrative maritime gas fields			1
but @entity34 appeared keen to avoid a clash between the nationalists ' flotilla and the @entity5 ships			2
stay away : a @entity122 vessel sprays @entity124 ships sailing close to the disputed islands with water cannons last year protests : @entity4 's purchase of the islands was met by fierce protests in @entity5 last year @entity4 's @entity122 , which had 13 vessels shadowing the boats , urged them to leave and escorted them away			1
last year members of the same group , known as ' @entity79 ' ( @entity80 ! @entity4 ) , landed on one of the rocky islets and triggered @entity84 protests in @entity5 , where lingering resentment over @entity4 's wartime aggression has been rekindled			1
some @entity4 experts said that , despite the latest tensions , the @entity143 rivals might avoid a re-run of the violent protests last september that hurt economic ties between the two countries			0
those protests were sparked when @entity4 's government bought the islands from a private owner			1
meanwhile , @entity58 , where bitter memories of @entity4 's 1910 - 1945 colonisation run deep , has cancelled a trip to @entity4 by its foreign minister following the weekend visits to the @entity50			2
no trouble : @entity34 appeared keen to avoid any clashes like this one in waters near the islands last year as the @entity122 escorted the flotilla away from the area @entity58 foreign ministry spokesman @entity164 said matters of history should be kept separate from efforts to cooperate over @entity170 's nuclear ambitions			2
he said : ' it is helpful that the region 's countries and the international community work together and pool their wisdom to solve this problem ( of @entity170 )			0
' but when it comes to history issues like the @entity50 visit , our government takes a firm stance			0
that must not be mixed			0
' but conservatives in @entity4 argue they should be able to pay their respects to the nation 's war dead in their own way			1
remembrance : @entity4 prime minister @entity60 gave an offering to a @entity4 war shrine over the weekend @entity193 , a ruling @entity194 lawmaker said : ' it is natural for lawmakers to worship at a shrine for people who died for the nation and every nation does this			1
i do n't understand why we get a backlash			0
' the group of lawmakers typically visits the shrine during its annual spring and autumn festivals , although the delegation was unusually large this year			0
@entity4 deputy prime minister @entity62 shrugged off overseas anger over the visits			0
he said : ' i first visited @entity50 on april 28 , 1953 and often went there ever since			0
' i go there two or three times every year and it 's not something that should be taken up now			0
there 's a reaction from overseas ? ' but that 's their reaction and i do n't think it will much affect @entity4 's diplomatic relations with other countries			2
' @entity60 has enjoyed sky - high popularity ratings of more than 70 percent since he took office in december and launched his ' @entity229 ' plan to boost growth and beat deflation with hyper - easy monetary policy , spending and structural reform			0
the prime minister , who has said he regretted not visiting @entity50 during his 2006 - 2007 term in office , has been walking a fine line between talking tough in the territorial row with @entity5 and leaving the door open for dialogue			0
voters want @entity60 to put priority on fixing the economy rather than other issues close to his heart , such as revising @entity4 's pacifist constitution , an opinion poll showed this week .			2
