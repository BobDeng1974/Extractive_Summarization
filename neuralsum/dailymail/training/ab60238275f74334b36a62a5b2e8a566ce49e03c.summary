@entity1 has ignored hundreds of residents ' wishes by ploughing ahead with the controversial development near @entity6 , @entity7 , which will be the size of 110 football pitches			1
it is claimed that @entity22 , the operators of the solar farm - the third biggest in @entity21 - will receive a substantial amount of the very government subsidies which mp for @entity7 mr @entity1 has campaigned against			1
the 55 - year - old politician has been accused of presiding over the ‘ industrialisation of the countryside ’ , with more than 500 people objecting to the project on the grounds the 174 - acre farm will be a blot on the landscape			1
they argued it will blight views from miles around - and that the sheer scale of the development is out of kilter with the rural location , which once inspired author @entity43 in his writings			1
despite protests , the local authority yesterday voted to grant planning permission by one vote			2
mr @entity1 , who is currently supporting opposition to plans for a wind farm off the @entity7 coast , has not yet personally commented today on the solar farm on his 7,000 acre @entity54			1
but a spokesman for the @entity54 said : ' the @entity56 notes the approval of the photovoltaic scheme at @entity59			0
' @entity60 has worked carefully with @entity22 ( which is leasing the land from mr @entity1 ) to identify a suitable site and consider the balance of a wide range of interests			2
aerial view : the solar farm on his 7,000 acre @entity54 ( pictured ) has been granted permission by @entity69 for the next 30 years ' @entity60 will continue to liaise closely with @entity22 and the local community to progress the project as smoothly as reasonably possible			1
' last year mr @entity1 was one of 101 conservative mps who wrote to the government asking for the £ 7.6billion a year in subsidies to renewable energy like wind farms to be cut			2
an in an article he wrote in a local newspaper in june , mr @entity1 welcomed fracking to boost the crisis of energy supplies - and criticised amendments to the @entity83			1
he said : ‘ rather than deal with this potential crisis , the @entity83 increases the subsidies for wind - farms and solar panels to £ 7.6billion a year			2
‘ a recent @entity89 library report suggested that such subsidies have put 50,000 @entity21 into “ fuel poverty ”			0
’ @entity92 , 62 , lives a mile from the site of the solar farm which will be in @entity59 village			0
he said : ‘ it is most curious that ( mr @entity1 ) has been very vocal in his protests for the offshore wind farm , yet he is happy to install a giant solar farm on his estate			1
‘ it is also rather curious that only months ago he was talking about reducing subsidies for renewable energy when this farm on his land will be heavily subsidised			0
unhappy : mr @entity1 has been accused of presiding over the ' industrialisation of the countryside ' with more than 500 people objecting to the project on the grounds the 174 - acre farm will be a blot on the landscape ‘ he has gone against the views and wishes of the local community			1
an area of great landscape value will be ruined for the next 30 years			0
‘ we opposed to its sheer size and scale - it will be the equivalent of 110 football pitches			1
it will have a detrimental visual impact and will be seen for miles around			0
it will impact seriously on the amenity value for horse riders and ramblers			0
’ ' it is most curious that ( mr @entity1 ) has been very vocal in his protests for the offshore wind farm , yet he is happy to install a giant solar farm on his estate ' @entity92 , local resident @entity137 , of @entity138 , the daughter of retired @entity140 diplomat sir @entity141 , grew up in @entity59			1
she said : ‘ this beautiful landscape is now threatened to become a hideous industrial park of glass and steel			0
it is effectively the industrialisation of the countryside			2
these farms have to be in the right places			0
‘ if @entity1 is so keen on renewable energy why not put the farm in view of his beautiful home , within the high walls of @entity156 and not have to disturb others ? ‘ it ’s hard not to feel that the impetus behind this scheme is financial and not about renewable energy			1
it will receive a huge sum in subsidies on top of the electricity that is generated that will be sold to the national grid			0
’ empty space : part of the proposed site for the new solar farm near the village of @entity59 in @entity7 the solar farm has been granted permission by @entity69 for the next 30 years			1
it will contain 120,000 solar panels on grade 3a arable land and will generate power to nearly 7,000 homes			0
' this beautiful landscape is now threatened to become a hideous industrial park of glass and steel ' @entity137 , opposing the farm the project will be run by the company @entity22 which will lease the land from mr @entity1			1
the @entity1 family are no strangers at being labelled the villain of the piece			2
mr @entity1 ’s late grandfather sir @entity193 went to school with @entity196 creator @entity195 who named @entity197 , the villain in @entity198 , after him			2
@entity1 , whose full name is @entity1 , previously said in a statement that the solar farm had taken local residents ’ views			1
he said : ‘ following a detailed and thorough assessment of the area , an application for planning consent for the proposal has been submitted			0
village : @entity59 , the site of the huge solar farm , which residents argue will blight views from miles around ‘ the opinion of the local community was sought prior to submitting the application and will continue to be incorporated			1
the site is well screened and the land will be planted to a wildflower rich grass sward			0
' the opinion of the local community was sought prior to submitting the application and will continue to be incorporated ' @entity1 , in a previous statement ‘ the local area will benefit from a community fund to be established			2
at the end of the project the land will return to the existing agricultural use			0
’ @entity22 said the solar farm will have a capacity to generate @entity231 of power and will generate enough renewable electricity to power around 6,800 homes			0
@entity236 , head of development at @entity22 said : ‘ we would like to thank everyone who has supported the project so far			0
‘ the location and design of the solar farm will make the most of the area ’s sunshine for renewable energy generation while minimising impacts on the landscape , and enhancing biodiversity			2
’ the scheme is expected to begin generating electricity as early as april next year			0
