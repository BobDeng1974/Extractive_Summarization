@entity0 is happy to take the flak if his @entity3 side are knocked out of the @entity4 on wednesday night			1
newcastle are the visitors to @entity6 as both sides look to make it into the semi-finals and be two matches away from a march final at @entity12			2
@entity3 overcame @entity13 in the last round despite making 10 changes from their previous @entity17 fixture , and @entity0 had a similar rotation philosophy during his time at @entity20			1
@entity0 is willing to take responsibility if @entity3 lose to @entity5 in the @entity4 @entity0 could make wholesale changes from the team that won 2 - 1 at @entity24 on sunday afternoon @entity3 vs @entity5 kick - off : 7.45pm at @entity6 tv : highlights on @entity28 at 11.05pm radio : 5 @entity30 from 7.30pm referee : @entity32 although he would not be drawn on who would feature against @entity35 's men other than to confirm @entity37 's absence , @entity0 insists any team he picks will be good enough to get the job done			1
when asked about being criticised for making changes he replied : ' it was a lack of respect for my players			0
' i always defend my players			0
if we have players in the squad , it is because we believe in them			0
if not , why are the players in the squad ? ' but always when you lose , people take something to criticise you			0
for me , it 's a lack of respect , not for me but for the players who played in the game			2
' i accept the criticism , but i ca n't accept criticism for the players			1
' @entity60 celebrates scoring @entity3 's winner at @entity24 in sunday 's match @entity0 would only confirm that @entity37 is absent from the match against @entity5 @entity64 calls on fans to get @entity3 into semis a packed early - season schedule in the @entity17 , @entity68 and the @entity4 means @entity0 would be ready to freshen up his side on wednesday - and would face the consequences if the decision backfired			1
when asked if there would be changes , he said : ' maybe			0
at the beginning of the season , we played a lot of games , 26			0
' for tomorrow , maybe one player is tired and not fresh , and if another team - mate is in better condition then why not ? ' but i am a manager and i need to make a decision			1
you can not pick a team to guarantee that we go to the semi-final			2
@entity87 was on target as @entity3 beat @entity13 3 - 1 in the last round of the competition ' in football it is easy to talk after the game			1
but the important thing is taking the decision before			0
when you are the coach , you have all the information and if you win , you are the best and if you do n't , you are a s * * t who made the wrong decision			0
' one player who will not be considered is @entity37 , with @entity0 insisting it is ' impossible ' for the 30 - year - old to play a part			1
the striker was granted compassionate leave last week as he flew to @entity107 for ' personal reasons ' and his future at @entity6 remains unclear			0
@entity0 said : ' he was back yesterday , but play tomorrow ? no. ' he began training after one week yesterday so it would be impossible for him to be ready tomorrow			2

@entity3 take on @entity5 in @entity4 quarter - finals
@entity0 is preparing to make changes to his team
but @entity3 manager would only confirm @entity37 's absence
he said he would accept the criticism if they were knocked out
