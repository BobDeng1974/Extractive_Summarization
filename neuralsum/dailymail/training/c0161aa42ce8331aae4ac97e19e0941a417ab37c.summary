by @entity0 former champion @entity1 does not feel disrespected being sent out in the first group for the start of the 143rd @entity4 at @entity5 and insists he is just grateful to have a tee time at all			1
the @entity8 , who won the @entity10 in 2001 on another north - west course at @entity7 , goes out with @entity12 and @entity13 at 6.25am on thursday			1
some may have perceived that as not treating a former winner with the respect he deserves , but the 42 - year - old does not see it that way			1
no problem : @entity1 ( right ) is n't feel disrespected by being sent off in the first group at the @entity4 having seen his career go into a downward spiral after his @entity4 win , with injuries , illness and personal issues all contributing to a spectacular loss of form , @entity1 is keen to make the most of every opportunity			1
' i do n't take it as being disrespectful at all , ' he said			2
' i have always said i do n't care when i tee off , just give me a tee time			1
' i am fortunate to have been a past champion and as long as i 'm playing golf i 'll be coming			0
rough time : @entity1 's form since his 2001 @entity4 win has dropped due to injuries , illness and personal issues ' everyone has their opinions and favourites but i think this is the most cherished event in golf			1
' i take it as @entity46 ( @entity47 chief executive ) sending me out to make sure the pace gets set properly			0
' he is asking me to do him a favour so we 're not backing up the course			0
' i hope we 're done by 10.25 - if it is up to me we will be			0
' such an early start creates its own logistical challenges for any professional golfer , but for a player with @entity1 's long list of back , neck and wrist injuries there are additional difficulties			2
at least he has had some preparation for what lies ahead , as he practised with @entity65 in his customary early morning start on tuesday			0
' it is a little harder , i 'm getting a little older and stiffer to get up at 4am and it takes a while to get loose and warm , " added the former world number one , currently ranked 940th having been as low as 1,508 at the end of last year			0
' i hit 5.30am balls on tuesday morning and i still was n't ready to tee off at 7am			2
' i am contemplating whether to go to bed or not			0
maybe i should go to the pub till 4am and then come over here ? ' i struggle to go to bed real early but i 'm going to have to figure a way to get to sleep at nine o'clock tonight - maybe watching @entity77 television will help			0
' good times : @entity1 won the @entity10 back in 2001 at the @entity7 golf course			1
