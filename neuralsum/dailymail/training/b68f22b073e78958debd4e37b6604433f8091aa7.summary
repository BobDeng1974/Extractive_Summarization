by @entity0 meet @entity1 - the @entity2 's youngest female sumo wrestler who takes on women more than twice her size			1
fifteen - year - old @entity1 is already the @entity2 female 80 kilos ( 12.5st ) champion weighing in at 11st			1
and the 5ft 9in teen is so fearless she takes boys - and 25st female sumos in competition			1
@entity1 , from @entity10 , said : ' people do n't believe me at first when i tell them i 'm a sumo wrestler because they think sumos have to be massive and extremely strong			1
' @entity15 's girl : @entity1 learned sumo from her father and the two share a passion for the sport , although neither will give an inch normal : when @entity1 is n't wrestling , she likes to do all the things the average teenage girl does ' and when i first started sumo i had a lot of boys saying i was n't going to get anywhere because i was a girl			1
' but i took them on in the sumo ring and sometimes i beat them - so they 're not as sure of themselves any more			2
she added : ' i think a lot of people think sumo is just about two fat guys pushing each other out of the ring			1
' my friends and the boys at school also used to think it was weird and they 'd make a few jokes about it but now they think it 's great and i even teach them moves			2
' she admits she 's come away from some fights with twisted ankles and even a bloody nose but the gsce student says she 's just like any other girl			2
she added : ' i like to wear make - up and lots of bright and pretty clothes - even though i like to beat people up , i still like to look good			2
' if i 've not got my training clothes on i 'm just a normal girl with a bit of an edge			0
' record : @entity1 is the @entity2 's youngest ever sumo wrestler , although that has n't stopped her winning tough : @entity1 's coach says she 's stronger than most of the boys she goes head to head with travel : @entity1 would like to go to @entity71 to meet the country 's professional wrestlers family affair : @entity1 's father @entity75 ( left ) is also a sumo wrestler and loves watching his daughter in action like other forms of wrestling , winning a @entity81 bout requires one wrestler ( rikishi ) to force another out of a circular ring ( dohy≈ç ) or to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of the feet			1
the sport originated in @entity71 , which remains the only country where sumo has a professional body and fighters can be paid for their efforts			1
@entity1 , the eldest of five children , had her first taste of fighting sports at just six years old after watching dad , @entity75 , 35 , who is a keen boxer as well as a sumo wrestler			1
by the age of 13 she had started at a local sumo gym , run by @entity103 , founder of the @entity104			0
now she trains there three times a week for competitions and has to eat a strict 2,000 calorie diet with plenty of protein			0
she can lift up to 50 kilo weights and has even started fighting @entity75 , a project management consultant , in practice contests			0
she said : ' it does n't frighten me when i 'm up against someone who 's bigger			0
i tell myself that i can do it and if i just go in there and try my best , i might be able to win			0
' @entity1 become so strong she can lift her dad , who competes in the 70 kilos category , above her head			1
but @entity75 has taken it all on the chin and says he and his wife , @entity123 , 34 , are proud of their daughter 's achievements			0
he said : ' i think it 's good that women should learn a martial art or a self - defense so they can keep fit and look after themselves			0
' @entity1 makes a good sumo wrestler because she 's very stubborn and she 's extremely strong for her age			1
she also likes the challenge of it			0
' winner : so good is @entity1 , she regularly trounces wrestlers who weigh more than twice what she does full - time mum @entity123 , 34 , added : ' i think any mother would be worried about their daughter wrestling			1
' she broke her nose once and i went in to panic			0
it 's heartbreaking when she gets hurt but i 'm always there to support her			0
i 'm on hand to bandage her up and mend the injuries			0
' it is nerve racking but she 's got good supportive people around her who we trust			2
' @entity1 travelled to @entity153 , @entity154 , for the @entity155 last year - where competed in an open - weight category			2
she faced a 25 - stone competitor but , incredibly , that did n't faze her and she 's returning this year			0
coach @entity103 even has hopes that she will eventually travel to the home of @entity81 in @entity161 , @entity71			1
he said : ' @entity1 is actually stronger than most of the boys			2
when she fought them and won i knew she 'd be a champion			0
she 's getting stronger each week			0
' @entity1 added : ' @entity81 is such a different sport and it 's so enjoyable			1
those who say girls ca n't be sumo wrestlers are talking rubbish			0
' at the moment , there 's hardly any girls in sumo wrestling but it would be awesome if more would join and i hope that i can inspire more to do it			2
' clash : @entity1 and her father @entity75 demonstrate how sumo wrestling is done bad luck @entity15 ! @entity1 sees off the challenge from her sumo wrestler father , @entity75			1
