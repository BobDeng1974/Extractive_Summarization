the groundhog might see his shadow on february 2 - but he wo n't be seeing mayor @entity3			1
a year after a groundhog slipped from mr @entity3 's grasp during the annual @entity8 ceremony , the zoo is reportedly making a change to prevent the mayor from handling the animal			1
mayor @entity3 , for one , would be happy with the new plan			0
the animal later died of internal injuries , a post-mortem exam found ' i think reform is needed , ' he joked during an unrelated news conference in @entity28 yesterday			1
' i welcome a new approach			0
' a year ago , the creature squirmed from @entity3 's grasp after predicting six more weeks of winter and fell several feet to the ground			1
it died a week later			1
a post-mortem revealed it suffered internal injuries , but it was not clear if they stemmed from the fall			1
moreover , it was revealed that the rodent that died was not the zoo 's famed @entity42 , but rather a female stand - in named @entity45			2
the zoo did not notify the mayor 's office about the death			2
the story prompted a flood of @entity52 jokes about a # @entity54 cover - up and mr @entity3 's possible impeachment			2
and it was n't even the first time a mayor had had an unfortunate run - in with a @entity8 groundhog : a squirming @entity15 bit then - mayor @entity62 in 2009			2
taking no chances : this year the zoo wo n't allow the mayor to hold the groundhog and it will instead be kept inside a plexiglass case to avoid any more unfortunate accidents this february the zoo is changing its ceremony so the mayor wo n't pick up the animal			1
instead , it will be in a plexiglass case			0
a spokesman at the zoo declined to comment			0
last year was mr @entity3 's first time participating in the ceremony			2
he admitted yesterday that he was n't ready to handle the groundhog			1
' i must say last time , there was not an overwhelming amount of preparation and orientation before i was handed him , ' mr @entity3 said			0
' may he rest in peace			0
' the zoo has four groundhogs , all with the variations of the brand name ' @entity15			0
' on the morning of february 2 , zoo staff select which of the groundhogs will participate in the ceremony and be dubbed @entity15 for the day			0
the animal 's formal name is @entity95 .			0

last year 's groundhog died of internal injuries after it fell to the ground
it died a week after predicting @entity18 would *shiver* for six more weeks
@entity103 admitted he had n't had much practice in handling groundhogs
