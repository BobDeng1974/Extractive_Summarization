@entity0 accepted £ 2,500 from @entity1 for holding events about £ 54million budget cuts the presenter of the @entity6 ’s @entity5 is being paid £ 2,500 by a @entity8 - run council – for chairing meetings on how to cut its budget by £ 54million			1
residents expressed astonishment that @entity0 had received such a fee from cash - strapped @entity15			2
the 46 - year - old mother of two , who presents the weekday current affairs programme on @entity19 , chaired two consultation meetings at the council ’s civic centre in @entity23 , north - west @entity24 , on tuesday			2
her involvement came hours before her director - general , @entity26 , reminded the corporation ’s staff to act ‘ without fear or favour ’ yesterday			0
@entity34 , a community campaigner who attended one of the council meetings , said : ‘ with the greatest respect to @entity0 , is there no council officer who ’s capable of chairing a couple of meetings ? it seems that yet again @entity15 has a very skewed sense of priorities			1
‘ we ’ve already had a 25 per cent increase in councillor allowances , £ 100,000 spent on an opening ceremony for the civic centre and £ 700,000 spent on laying granite outside the civic centre … they ’ve got to get a grip on spending money on ridiculous things like this when they ’re cutting services to vulnerable people			1
’ @entity57 spokesman added : ‘ at a meeting to discuss savings , it does seem strange to spend a four - figure sum to bring in a chair , despite @entity0 ’s undoubted experience as a well - regarded broadcaster			1
‘ the council has to provide a far fuller explanation of why this spending was approved , particularly in the context of a multi-million - pound savings programme			2
’ cuts proposed by the council for the next two years include pulling funding to youth services , shutting a sports centre and cutting back on children ’s centres and respite care			1
a day care centre for disabled residents is also under threat			0
the council claims it has been forced into the cuts by central government , which has cut its funding by half			2
the @entity6 will not give in to ‘ naked bullying ’ from its critics , @entity26 said yesterday			0
the corporation ’s director - general insisted that as may ’s election approaches , his organisation must cover political issues ‘ without fear or favour ’			0
referring to the @entity6 ’s next @entity93 in 2017 , which will see the licence fee come up for renegotiation , @entity26 told staff : ‘ there may be some – i hope only a few – who try and use the impending @entity93 to influence our coverage of politics in this most sensitive of political years			0
' we will never let that happen , because to do so would betray the public and the ideals of the @entity6			2
’ he admitted : ‘ we will get things wrong – it ’s inevitable – and we will reflect and put things right where we have			0
but we will never confuse justifiable complaints with naked bullying			0
’ he called on the corporation ’s workers to help make the case for the @entity6 by ‘ spending every penny ’ of the £ 145.50 licence fee ‘ as if it were your own ’			0
council leader @entity118 said : ‘ ms @entity0 is a powerful independent voice and an expert chair			1
' she will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to look carefully and objectively at the budget savings proposals being considered by the cabinet , and to provide honest and independent advice on the whole budget process			0
this is in addition to hosting two consultation events with the public			1
he added : ‘ it is extremely important for councillors to get the views of residents , community groups and voluntary groups when making difficult budget decisions imposed on us by severe reductions to our government grant			0
' for this we are paying £ 2,500 which i believe represents value for money , considering the importance of the council having to save £ 54million			1
’ a @entity6 spokesperson said : " @entity0 was an independent chair for these events , during which she questioned and cross examined council members remaining neutral and impartial , just as she does in her role on the @entity5			1
acting as a neutral chair of a public debate is not a breach of @entity6 editorial guidelines			0
' campaigners say that @entity8 - run @entity1 spends money on ' ridiculous things ' such as £ 700,000 for granite around its civic centre ( pictured ) , where @entity0 hosted two consultation meetings			1

*tv* host @entity0 will host two public consultation events in @entity167
council must cut its budget by £ 54million
youth services *threatened* , though officials spend on ' ridiculous things '
despite *backlash* , council leader says @entity0 ' represents value for money '
