by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 14:38 est , 9 june 2013 a self - described conservative @entity2 who is a manager in the @entity4 office that targeted tea party groups told investigators that he , not the @entity8 , set the review in motion , the top @entity11 on the @entity8 watchdog committee said sunday			1
rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , released a partial transcript of the @entity17 interview with the unnamed manager in the @entity4 ' @entity20 office			1
in it , the employee said the extra scrutiny for tea party groups ' tax exempt status was an effort to be consistent in reviewing applications and not driven by politics			1
democratic representative @entity13 : says ' extreme accusations ' of @entity31 's involvement in the @entity4 scandal are ' unsubstantiated ' this letterhead from the @entity4 headquarters in @entity31 , accompanied a probing letter directed at a tea party group			1
the @entity4 inspector general investigated only similar communications from the agency 's @entity20 office ' he is a conservative @entity2 working for the @entity4			1
i think this interview and these statements go a long way to what 's showing that the @entity8 was not involved in this , ' @entity13 said			1
' based upon everything i 've seen , the case is solved			0
and if it were me , i would wrap this case up and move on , to be frank with you , ' @entity13 added			2
in the five - hour interview conducted last week , the manager said one of his employees brought to him a tea party group 's application for tax exempt status			1
the manager said he recognized the political implications of the decision and flagged it for an office in @entity31			0
some republicans have suggested that the @entity31 office initiated the close examination			0
@entity4 offices in the @entity69 towns of @entity70 and @entity71 sent politically motivated letters to tea party groups , suggesting that the problem reached beyond the @entity20 office where the @entity77 report focused one letter , sent to a northern @entity69 organization , demanded to know about its links with the @entity82 ( @entity69 ) @entity81			1
' @entity83 ' was one phrase that reportedly triggered a ' @entity86 ' notice among @entity4 employees looking for politically conservative applicants for tax - exempt statuses @entity2 have complained the @entity4 targeted tea party groups because they are critical of @entity91 and president @entity92			1
an internal @entity4 report found the agency improperly targeted the small - government advocates for additional scrutiny			1
the uproar forced out the acting @entity4 chief and put the @entity8 on the defensive against those who suggested @entity92 was using the government to go after political enemies			2
sunday 's release of yet another partial transcript was unlikely to quiet those critics			0
' the @entity107 public wants to know why targeting occurred and who was involved , ' said oversight chairman rep. @entity109 , @entity110 , in statement released sunday			0
' the testimony excerpts ranking member @entity13 revealed today did not provide anything enlightening or contradict other witness accounts			2
the only thing ranking member @entity13 left clear in his comments today is that if it were up to him the investigation would be closed			0
' the @entity81 and other conservative groups provided a powerful rallying force during the 2010 midterm elections			2
it was around the same time that the @entity92 administration 's @entity4 began targeting such groups that applied for tax - exempt nonprofit status oversight committee investigators have now interviewed at least five @entity4 employees about targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections			1
some employees said they believed that officials in @entity31 were directing their work but did n't show any direct evidence to support their statements			0
@entity13 and @entity109 have been releasing portions of interviews that back up their assertions			0
but neither has released full transcripts , making it difficult to discern a complete story			0
also , the portions released tend to offer employees ' views on what was happening , not definitive orders that directed them to scrutinize closely tea party applications			2
@entity148 : tea party stalwarts were known for stubbornly supporting a strict reading of the @entity151 , and for getting under the skin of political liberals			2
news that the @entity4 , under the @entity92 administration , singled them out for special screening , may energize them into another potent force in time for the 2014 election @entity13 declined to release the full transcript of the interview he posted on @entity91 ' oversight website			1
a @entity13 spokeswoman , @entity162 , declined to release the employees ' identity			0
in the 15 - page memo describing their interview with the manager , @entity91 on the committee said they were withholding the employee 's name at the request of the @entity4			0
@entity13 appeared on @entity173 's ' @entity172 ' and @entity175 's ' @entity174 ' .			0

top democrat @entity13 says no evidence to suggest order to review conservative groups was a @entity8 order
tax agency has admitted targeting tea party groups and other conservative organizations for special , politically motivated scrutiny
@entity4 inspector general focused on *wrongdoing* in @entity20 , @entity190 office and ignored *abusive* letters coming from other *cities*
