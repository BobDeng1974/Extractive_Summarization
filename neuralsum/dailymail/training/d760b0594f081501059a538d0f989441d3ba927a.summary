a @entity1 congressman from @entity2 was caught last week digging his finger in his ear and then eating whatever it was he found			2
representative @entity7 was at a may 7 @entity9 hearing on government surveillance , but it was his own reconnaissance mission that @entity13 footage has now revealed			1
it was a live shot , in fact , and the @entity17 congressman had the poor timing to undertake his treasure hunt while sitting directly behind his colleague as she took the floor			0
before the cameras have left him , the first term @entity23 even looks at his fingers before putting them back into his mouth yet again			0
does the gentleman from @entity2 have something to share ? @entity30 congressman @entity7 was caught picking his ear by @entity13 cameras last week , but it only got worse from there first he looks at it : @entity7 was sitting right behind a colleague as she addressed a @entity9 hearing on government surveillance then he puts it in his mouth : while the hearing was about @entity42 activities , @entity7 appeared to be on a one - man recon mission all his own and a thumb : @entity7 takes his hand from his mouth but soon puts the finger back in , along with a thumb third time 's the charm : just to make sure he did n't miss anything , @entity7 's returns his hand to his mouth a third time , all while his fellow congressman still has the @entity13 cameras directly on her			1
