by @entity0 the overnight fame that comes with joining one of @entity4 's most popular soaps must be hard to deal with - as @entity6 star @entity5 can testify			1
the 23 - year - old , who last june became the sixth person to play @entity5 on the show , admits he struggled to cope with the attention			1
' i did n't realise the impact it would have on my life , ' says @entity15 - born @entity5			1
' the show is so popular that lots of people approach you and ask for photos			1
everyone 's lovely , but sometimes if you 'd rather be on your own it 's the last thing you want to do			2
' @entity5 , who plays @entity5 in @entity6 , says that he found it difficult to adjust to sudden fame in fact , @entity5 found it so hard to cope with fame he shut himself away in the west @entity29 home he shares with his actress girlfriend of four years @entity31 , also 23			1
' for a while i did n't want to leave the house , ' he reveals			2
' eventually i just got sick of being indoors			2
now i take steps not to be noticed when i do n't want to be			2
for instance , i live near @entity38 shopping centre , so i wo n't go there at the weekend			2
' but i guess it 's just one of those things , and i 'm grateful to have such support from @entity6 viewers			2
' @entity5 's profile is set to become even higher as the ' whodunnit ' murder mystery of @entity47 grows			1
as @entity47 's on - screen twin he 's right in the thick of it - and will even be named as a suspect			2
the storyline is set to run into next year , the @entity54 flagship soap 's 30th anniversary			1
' i 'm chuffed to be getting gritty stuff , ' says @entity5			1
' i liked the love story with @entity57 but it 's nice to get stuck into a storyline like this			1
none of the cast knows who the killer is , and everyone 's talking about it			1
@entity5 says that although he enjoyed the love story between @entity5 and @entity57 ( pictured ) , he is enjoying being part of a grittier story line on the show ' i do n't think being the killer would fit @entity5 's character , but i would n't shy away from it if that was what was decided			1
' @entity5 , who starred in @entity76 play @entity77 before joining @entity6 , admits he found the transition from stage to screen difficult			1
' on stage you rehearse for five weeks and it goes out to 300 people , ' he says			2
' in @entity6 you get ten minutes to rehearse and seven million people watch it ! after such a short rehearsal time you often feel there 's more to give			0
it 's frustrating but you just have to put it to one side and get on with your next scene			0
' if i had to choose i 'd say i prefer the stage , as that 's what i 've always done			0
i 'd love to play a lead in the theatre			0
' for now though , @entity5 , who 's up for @entity98 at next month 's @entity99 ( ' it 's flattering but it 's not an accolade for acting , it 's genetics ! ' ) is happy on @entity103			1
' i do n't know how long i 'll be in @entity6			0
i 'll see what happens , what storylines i get , ' he says			0
@entity5 is also equally easy - going about matters of the heart - specifically whether he and @entity31 , who met in the same class at acting school , plan to marry			1
' i fancied @entity31 the moment i met her			0
she 's great and we moved in together about a year ago			1
marriage ? i 'll see how it goes - we 're both young so there 's plenty of time yet			0
' holidays : sun or snow ? the hotter the better because i like to get a tan and it 's cold all the time here			0
@entity123 spoon or silver service ? i prefer an upmarket place because i like a nice cut of steak with chips			0
rum or vodka ? vodka - with lime and soda			0
it 's good for my waistline ! sport : watching or playing ? both			0
i played a lot of rugby growing up and i go and watch @entity138 all the time			0
music : pop or rock ? i was at @entity141 's @entity29 concert recently and turned into a screaming fan ! cars : vintage or modern ? if i could drive any car then it would be the beautiful , old - school @entity148			0
@entity150 or @entity151 ? @entity151			0
i do n't know how he did n't win an @entity152 for the master .			0

@entity5 shot to fame last year after being cast as @entity5
he said he finds being recognised difficult and often hides himself a way
@entity5 is looking forward to a grittier story line for his character
