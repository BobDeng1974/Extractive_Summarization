the decision is a bitter blow to golf club members who had hoped they would be allowed to keep a nine - hole course			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ when we bought the golf club ’s land we had the long term in mind and when the lease runs out , building courts there and moving our qualification event from @entity17 to on - site will make sense			1
‘ it ’s a few years away and we ’ve so much to do already with what we are planning at the moment that we are focused on that			0
’ facing the boot : @entity22 , which has 800 members including @entity69 and television presenters @entity46 is set to close			1

@entity95 , director at @entity96 , who is working on a stadium design for the 2022 football @entity99 in @entity101 , said : ‘ if i were advising @entity3 , i would tell them that for the new site they should focus on more hospitality including exclusive suites and high - end restaurants			1
‘ the inclusion of an iconic feature , such as @entity108 , is also essential			0
those are the details that people know around the world and have helped @entity3 become the force it is today			0
’ money is no object for the tennis club			0
the @entity3 tournament generated £ 37.8 million profits in 2012			1
the club has predicted it will raise £ 100 million from debentures alone before 2020			1
officially , there is still 27 years before the golf club ’s lease expires but there is already talk of the tennis club offering the golfers a sweetener to leave far sooner			0
a recent letter from the golf club to members said : ‘ we should most sensibly assume that our lease will not be renewed in 2041 , not even for a nine - hole course			1
’ celebrity players : @entity46 , pictured before the @entity135 at @entity136 , frequently use the golf club which looks set to close one member said : ‘ it ’s terribly sad to lose a 100 - year - old golf club			2
the council should never have been allowed to sell it [ the freehold ]			0
i know we could have bid for it but it was our members ’ money being pitted against the might of the tennis club , and we did n’t have a chance			2
’ if the @entity6 wants to include new permanent structures on the golf course , it will have to upgrade the planning status of the land			2
‘ that wo n’t be a serious problem , ’ said the golf club member			0
‘ the tennis club knows how valuable the tournament is to @entity3 and the council will do all it can to help them			2
the last time there was a really serious difference of opinion the @entity6 threatened to move their whole operation to @entity168 and the council caved in immediately			0
