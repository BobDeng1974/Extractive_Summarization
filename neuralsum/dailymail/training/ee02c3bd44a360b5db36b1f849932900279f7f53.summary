by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 23 july 2013 the horoscope of our future monarch contains a rare and auspicious alignment			1
it also poses two of the greatest cosmic challenges any astrologer could find in the chart of a newborn			1
this is a royal who will grow up in a time of turmoil and will eventually preside over an era of marvels			1
he will be a leader whose name will be remembered for the rest of time as the rule - breaker who became a peacemaker			1
the announcement : the @entity26 's press secretary @entity25 , with @entity27 , a footman , placing the official document proclaiming the birth of the baby boy children born in the few hours just before the @entity32 becomes precisely full — as it did at 7.16pm last night — tend to grow up troubled , but talented			1
they tend to feel tension and estrangement more closely than most and though they often grow into exceptional people , it is usually because they have had to deal with so many issues at an early age			1
this is the chart of a childhood that can not be entirely easy			2
unlikely though it may seem to us , given what we know ( or think we know ) of the @entity47 , there ’s a suggestion of pressures close to home that will make great demands on this young man			2
yet for all this drama and trauma , @entity54 and @entity55 ’s son will find an inner reserve of strength that shapes his character and moulds him into a truly charismatic monarch			2
his story will be full of hard - won victories and narrow escapes — and these themes will run through the story of his subjects			2
i base this prediction on far more than just the fact the new arrival is a sensitive @entity73 , just like his father and his grandmother @entity75			1
new parents : the @entity77 and @entity78 of @entity80 's newborn has been born at an auspicious time though the sign of @entity84 began just a couple of minutes after he drew his first breath , he is a @entity73 through and through , even though he was born so close to the end of this sign and his father was born at the beginning of it			1
the newborn @entity92 has the moon in @entity94 and @entity95 rising			2
these are tricky influences — moon in @entity94 people can be harshly self - critical and those with @entity95 rising can guard their privacy jealously — and there are other fascinating factors in his chart			0
just a few hours before his birth , @entity103 moved from @entity84 to @entity105 , suggesting that babies born this week will be blessed with clever , inquiring minds			0
star sign : the boy is a sensitive @entity73 , just like his father and his grandmother @entity75 and all this happened just as @entity112 ended a particularly difficult retrograde phase			1
children born when @entity112 is retrograde tend to be thinkers rather than doers			0
so it is almost as if the royal baby waited until he was a week overdue in order to pick up every possible astrological advantage to counteract the two most powerful potential downsides of his birth chart			0
children born so close to the monthly lunar culmination invariably lead charmed yet challenging lives			0
furthermore , a sharp opposition between @entity128 and @entity129 is close enough to be exerting an influence and that ’s an omen of lifelong strife and struggle			0
yet as readers of my column will know , this is a special week for another reason			0
a phenomenon known as a @entity139 is being formed in the sky between @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity143 in @entity95 plus the conjunction of @entity145 and @entity128 in @entity146			0
many experts are calling this a harmonic convergence and seeing it as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to heal the world , promote a culture of greater spirituality and increase an awareness of the need for world peace			0
this child inherits the spirit of this convergence , carries it for his lifetime and , despite trials and tribulations , will become a deeply influential force for good .			0

new arrival is a sensitive @entity73 , just like his father and *princess* @entity75
