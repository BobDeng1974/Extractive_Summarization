also found in the pond was a shotgun			2
since then , extensive searches of the @entity38 area have been carried out , including the use of a specialist dive team from @entity41 and @entity42 and cadaver dogs from @entity44			0
officers have now begun the task of draining and sieving thousands of litres of water from the 8ft deep pond to see what might be hidden at the bottom under several inches of silt			0
today @entity16 revealed they had located up to 60 pieces of women 's clothing buried under two inches of soil in thick woodland about 100 yards from the pond			1
in addition they have found a chunky knit cardigan close to the water			2
father - of - three @entity5 also admitted to police killing @entity64 , who had disappeared from @entity14 a decade earlier , but that confession was ruled inadmissible by a judge because a top detective had breached his rights			1
police have continued to investigate the murder of @entity71 , who had drifted into drugs and prostitution before her death			0
officers found her remains in a field in @entity79 , near @entity80 , @entity81 in march 2011 having been led there by @entity5			2

a police tent near the site where detectives say they have uncovered 60 items of women 's clothing officers are now draining and sieving thousands of litres of water from the 8ft deep pond to see what might be hidden at the bottom detective chief inspector @entity96 , who is leading the investigation into the death of @entity22 and @entity71 , said he was confident the clothing found in the woodland near @entity26 did not belong to @entity22			1
he said he did not know how long the clothing had been hidden but had been there for ' some time '			0
' someone has made some effort to hide it			0
there are in excess of 60 items of material , such as a sleeve , a zip or a hood , so it is difficult to say exactly how many items of clothing there are , ' mr @entity96 said			1
' there may be a really innocent explanation and someone may have fly - tipped it			0
equally it is really unusual to find women 's clothing buried			1
' it may genuinely have no significance at all but i am open minded as to why someone would bury clothing			0
' he added : ' but to me it does seem a very strange location to be burying clothes , given what else we have found here			0
' i am satisfied the clothing does not relate to @entity12 but i do n't know what @entity64 was wearing when she disappeared or exactly when she disappeared			2
' a police forensic officer displays the remains of the thick - cut cardigan found buried not far from the pond police say all items found at the site of the dig will be sent for forensic testing police inquiries had led them to look at areas of water in @entity33 where they found the boots			2
they are still missing miss @entity22 's handbag , mobile phone , items of jewellery , as well as the knife @entity5 used to kill her			1
@entity16 launched a high - profile inquiry when the office worker , who lived with her boyfriend @entity158 , failed to return home after a night out			0
under the leadership of detective superintendent @entity161 , @entity5 quickly became a suspect in her abduction and murder			2
police inquiries had led them to look at areas of water in @entity33 where they found the boots but the repeated failure of mr @entity161 to caution the father - of - three meant that a judge ruled the confessions to the killing of @entity22 and miss @entity64 were inadmissible in court because the officer had broken @entity176 ( @entity176 ) rules			1
although he was convicted of miss @entity22 's murder , with no other evidence tying @entity5 to the murder of @entity71 , the prosecution did not oppose an application by his defence team to dismiss the charge			1
in january this year , mr @entity161 was found guilty by an independent panel of two counts of gross misconduct and handed a final written warning as punishment			0
last week it emerged he had resigned from @entity16 , but the announcement with this breakthrough in the inquiry was not linked .			0
