fraud and false claims for the state benefit that is most often abused has amounted to an astonishing £ 12.6 billion since the turn of the @entity5 , mps reported yesterday			1
the amount sucked out of @entity7 by welfare cheats , in exaggerated claims , and through straightforward bureaucratic blunders was the equivalent of around £ 1 billion a year for the first 13 years of the century			1
the loss to the taxpayer would pay the price of policing @entity15 for a year or cover more than four fifths of the bill for the road improvements that @entity19 has promised over the next five years			1
and the influential @entity27 , which acts as a public spending watchdog , revealed the amount of fraud and error in @entity7 is still going up			1
a report condemned the @entity33 – which pays out for the benefit designed to cover the rent for people who can not afford to pay their own – for failure to curb false claims , and added that @entity3 were sceptical of promises by civil servants to slash the losses by more than two thirds by this spring			1
chairman @entity43 said : ‘ billions of pounds have been lost to the taxpayer as a result of the @entity33 ’s failure to tackle @entity7 fraud and error effectively			1
around £ 12.6 billion has been spent on @entity7 overpayments since 2000 , money that could have been used to improve the system			0
‘ the size of overpayments is going up not down			0
’ curbing fraud and error in @entity7 has proved difficult for all governments over the past 20 years , partly because the benefit is handed out by local councils which have varying levels of efficiency in detecting dishonest or inflated claims			2
@entity27 chairman @entity43 said the billions wasted could have been used to improve the system in the last financial year , 2013/14 , losses amounted to £ 1.4 billion , more than £ 400 million higher than in 2010/11			1
of this , £ 340 million was outright fraud and £ 900 million was claimant error , for example when someone who has been unemployed gets a job but forgets to tell the council that they have an income			0
the line between fraud and error is often blurred			0
another £ 150 million was lost in mistakes by staff calculating and paying the benefit			0
housing benefit losses account for more than £ 4 in every £ 10 of everything lost by the government in all false benefit claims			2
officials working for @entity82 @entity81 have said they will cut the level of loss , currently 5.8 per cent of all the @entity7 paid out , to 1.7 per cent by this spring			0
mrs @entity43 said : ‘ given the lack of evidence that the @entity33 is getting to grips with fraud and error , we view with scepticism the @entity33 ’s confidence that it will meet its target			2
’ she said the @entity33 was expecting ‘ significant ’ benefits from a siwth to ‘ real - time information ’ , under which @entity95 will tell the @entity33 as soon as someone gets a job , rather than giving @entity33 officials updates on the earnings of claimants just once a year			0
mrs @entity43 said officials were ‘ doing little else to tackle @entity7 fraud and error ’ .			0
