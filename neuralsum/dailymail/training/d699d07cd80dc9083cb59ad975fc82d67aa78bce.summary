the families of 96 people killed in the @entity3 tragedy will see thousands of official documents relating to the disaster for the first time today			1
the @entity7 has been overseeing the release of previously unpublished papers from around 80 organisations including the government , police , emergency services , @entity14 and the @entity16 coroner			0
the families of the 96 football fans who died in @entity20 's deadliest sporting disaster will be the first to see more than 400,000 pages			1
a report explaining the contents of the documents will be published by the panel , chaired by the @entity42 , the @entity44 @entity43			1
the 96 @entity46 supporters died in a crush at @entity49 's @entity48 on april 15 1989 where their team were to meet @entity51 in an @entity53 semi-final			1
a report into the disaster by @entity56 , published in 1990 , found that the main reason for the disaster was a failure of ' police control ' but the @entity61 decided there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution			1
the victims ' families say it is an injustice that no individual or organisation has been held fully accountable for the disaster			1
they believe a major incident plan was never initiated by @entity71 and fans in the @entity74 end were denied emergency medical attention			0
the families also dispute the findings of an inquest into the deaths , which ruled that the victims were all dead , or brain dead , by 3.15pm and which subsequently recorded a verdict of accidental death			1
shocking : @entity46 fans are pulled to safety on to the upper tier from the crush that was happening below at @entity3 abandoned : after the cup semi was stopped @entity46 manager @entity89 is comforted by a police officer , as he and @entity51 manager @entity92 came off the @entity3 pitch former @entity46 manager @entity89 , who was in charge of the club on that tragic day , said : ' i just hope that after all this time the families get a great deal of solace from whatever comes out			1
' the way they have conducted themselves over the last 23 years and the dignity that they have shown has never been anything short of remarkable and they ’ve got the full admiration of myself and many , many others for that			0
' now though , they need to be given the answers to the questions that they have been asking			0
all we can do is hope that it is as positive an outcome as possible given the difficult ­ circumstances and if they are able to take some solace from the information that they receive then it will be the very least that they deserve			0
' @entity127 , chairwoman of the @entity128 , said they hope the documents will answer some of the questions they have about the causes and aftermath of the tragedy			0
' this is what the families and the fans have been fighting for 23 years			2
without the truth you can not grieve and where there is deceit , you get no justice , ' mrs @entity127 , 65 , said			0
the families will see the documents at @entity148 and are being advised by two of @entity20 's best known lawyers , @entity149 and @entity151			2
it is expected the families will meet in the coming days to decide what action to take , if any , following the disclosures			1
painful : @entity127 , chairman of the @entity156 , said that there had been ' a massively orchestrated cover - up ' the panel was created by then home secretary @entity160 following the 20th anniversary of the disaster in april 2009			2
@entity165 to the panel 's work is to prepare and publish a comprehensive report based on in - depth research into the documents to ' add to public understanding of the tragedy , its circumstances and its aftermath '			1
@entity174 mp @entity173 , who has campaigned on behalf of the families , warned that the disclosures in the report would be ‘ more shocking than many people realise			1
’ he said : ‘ there will be many individuals with questions to answer			0
. but the truth will have its own power			0
' i know enough about @entity3 to know a national apology from the prime minister is justified			0
i hope mr @entity30 responds in the right way			1
' i get the feeling the disclosure will be more shocking than many people realise			0
the closer we get , i ’m confident the full truth will be told			0
that is an enormous thing			0
' history : the @entity196 has recently highlighted the @entity3 families long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed @entity200 , who lost her 15 year old son in the tragedy , has evidence that her son was still alive at 4pm			2
mr @entity173 described the cut - off point as ‘ sheer cruelty ’			2
‘ i , like the families , can not accept a verdict of accidental death , ’ he said			2
the @entity196 has recently highlighted the @entity3 families ’ long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed			2
leaked documents earlier this year found that senior officers blamed disorderly supporters just days after the disaster			0
in a briefing paper seen by former prime minister @entity219 , at least one @entity46 - based policeman said he was ‘ ashamed ’ of the spectators ’ behaviour			1
the briefings contrast with the findings of the official inquiry , which pinned the blame on officers responsible for crowd control at the @entity53 semi-final at @entity49 ’s ground			1
it said opening an exit gate just before kick - off enabled hundreds of fans to pour into a full ‘ pen ’ on the terraces , causing the fatal crush			0
the report is widely expected to hold @entity16 police to account for refusing to accept responsibility for the disaster and instead falsely putting the blame on drunk and ticketless @entity46 supporters			1
the findings are likely to trigger an overwhelming demand for fresh inquests into deaths .			0

96 died during 1989 @entity53 semi between @entity46 and @entity51
the pm will make a statement ' of regret ' to the @entity253 at *12.30pm*
