by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the honour of captaining @entity3 for one game on tour might not carry quite the same significance for @entity7 as it did for @entity8 , but the @entity10 midfielder hopes it is an indication of an equally bright future for him under @entity14 ’s management			1
@entity7 ’s decline at @entity17 last season was one of the more regrettable aspects of the @entity21 debacle			1
often played out of position and then not at all , a midfielder who had shown such promise under sir @entity25 even became a target for his own supporters			2
@entity43 defended him , but a lack of playing time at @entity3 ultimately cost the player a place on the plane to @entity48			1
@entity7 , who turns 25 next week , used the summer to take stock			1
he went on holiday with his partner @entity51 and their baby daughter , @entity52 , and came back determined to fight for his @entity17 future under @entity36			1
the reports from the manager ’s @entity57 coaching staff have been so positive that @entity7 played in every game on tour and was made captain for the victory over @entity31 in @entity63			1
it would be no surprise at all if a contract that is due to run out next summer is now extended , amid strong interest from @entity69			2
future clear : @entity7 will be hoping to provide @entity3 with an @entity71 core with @entity8 eyebrows raised : @entity7 struggled last year - there was even a petition for him not to make the @entity42 @entity7 admits he was hurt by the criticism but it has only made him more determined to prove his detractors wrong			1
‘ it makes you develop a lot thicker skin , ’ he said			2
‘ you ’ve just got to take it on the chin			2
‘ fans are passionate and they like to see their team win			2
and when their team is n’t winning , they ’ve got a right to look at the team			0
i will use it as a learning curve and not dwell on it as a negative			0
‘ yeah , i got a bit of stick			0
it does hurt when it comes from your own fans , i suppose it would anyone really			0
i definitely want to prove a few people wrong			0
‘ but i ’m not here to talk about @entity21			1
we ’ve got a clear way we are going to play under the new manager			0
we all believe in that , we are all following that and i think the main thing is we are playing as a team again			0
‘ under the new manager we are being told to think of things as a team but personally it has gone well			0
i definitely think i can fit into the way he plays			0
i do n’t think i have got to make much adaptation because he likes passers , movers , and people who understand the game			1
fighting back : he will be hoping to live up to his early promise at @entity17 strict : @entity36 has laid down the law at @entity3 - he will tell those who are n't in his plans this week ‘ i ’ve got minutes under my belt out here , i feel fit , we ’ve won every game , one of them on penalties			1
we ’re back being a top team together			1
‘ i would still have loved to have gone ( to the @entity42 ) but i think i made it hard for myself to go to @entity48 with not playing in the last three months of the season			1
‘ i played in a lot of the qualifiers , but i ’m not bitter about it			0
i ’m fully hoping to get back into the squad and help us get to the next euros			2
’ @entity7 acknowledges that fatherhood has also played a part in his resurgence			1
‘ definitely , ’ he added			0
‘ i ’ve learned a few things , off and on the pitch			0
obviously being a new dad you learn how to live your life better as well			0
you need to get into your sleeping routines and all that			0
i ’ve definitely learned from it and hopefully i will improve because of it this year			2
