stalking their prey around some of the most famous tourist attractions in the world , they will stop at nothing to intimidate and steal			2
these disturbing pictures showing gangs from @entity8 and @entity9 operating in @entity10 were published in the prestigious @entity12 magazine , which devoted eight pages to them under the headline @entity16			1
brazenly targeting their victims in broad daylight at cashpoints , on crowded pavements and in parks and @entity24 stations , the increasingly aggressive gangs are causing chaos and misery in the @entity28 capital			1
countless thefts are being carried out every day by members of the gangs , many of whom are barely teenagers			2
and , as @entity63 prepares to allow thousands of immigrants from @entity8 and @entity9 to seek work in the @entity63 as a result of changes to @entity69 immigration rules on january 1 next year , there is every chance of similar @entity31 gangs coming to the @entity63			1
president @entity74 ’s @entity73 government came to power a year ago promising to rehouse the @entity31 and integrate them into society			2
but , having criticised the @entity77 government of predecessor @entity78 for treating immigrants too harshly , @entity74 is now facing up to political reality			2
interior minister @entity81 has ordered police to dismantle the @entity31 gipsies ’ camps and shanty towns without rehousing them , and he has expelled more @entity31 from @entity28 than @entity78 did			1
last year , nearly 13,000 @entity8 and @entity9 were deported from @entity28 , an increase of 18.4 per cent on the previous year			1
and many plan to take advantage of the relaxation in @entity69 rule changes by moving to @entity63			2
this week , a leaked report from @entity94 ’s @entity93 — the equivalent of the @entity96 — revealed that the country has also suffered a flood of @entity8 immigrants because it has already relaxed its immigration rules			1
look out : the woman using the ticket machine has not noticed the girl in the pink shirt who is memorising ( circled ) her pin number and waits to steal her cash card the document describes overcrowded slum conditions , threats to public health , a dramatic increase in crime and disruption on the streets as a result of the influx of immigrants from the two countries			0
in the past year alone , 176,000 @entity8 and @entity9 have entered @entity94 , and local government organisations warn the authorities are struggling to cope			1
the @entity94 newspaper that acquired the leaked report says the document explicitly warns of the ‘ consequences for the social peace ’			0
the @entity93 report refers to ‘ extreme occupancy of dilapidated , uninhabitable properties with illegal dormitories ’ , adding that up to 20 people are sleeping to a room			0
it mentions ‘ dirty patios , overfilled rubbish bins ’ and ‘ noisy crowds into the small hours ’			0
the report also warns that schools are under pressure because of the number of non-german speaking pupils , and says that crime — particularly prostitution — is on the increase in areas where the newcomers have settled			0
in @entity10 , a favourite trick of the child gangs is to approach tourists with a fake ‘ petition ’ to sign while they are withdrawing money from cash machines			1
distracted by the approach , victims do not see the thieves noting their pin number and then pick - pocketing cash cards to withdraw money for themselves			0
‘ do you speak @entity165 ? ’ is another opening gambit used on tourists , as the gang members help themselves to money and possessions , often without their victims even noticing			0
otherwise , they just steal cash and valuables direct while people are sitting in parks or on the @entity24			0
some will have been among the 1,769 minors detained by @entity28 police for committing similar crimes in 2012 , but even if caught they are released within a few hours			1
having his collar felt : but this child gang member will be back on the streets within hours stop and search : a group of young @entity31 are lined up and frisked by @entity28 police ‘ there ’s very little we can do with them , ’ admitted a @entity10 police source			1
‘ as children , they effectively have absolute immunity from prosecution			0
much of the money they make ends up with the adult gangmasters who run them			0
they are much harder to catch because they hide away in the shadows			0
’ the @entity49 alone now has 20 permanent uniformed officers patrolling its galleries , with five of them placed at the entrance			0
similar patrols have been placed around sacred monuments including @entity196 and the @entity197 , as well as the @entity47 , the @entity198 , and the @entity199 , west of @entity10			2
plain - clothes officers are mingling with the thousands of people who visit @entity10 every day , and the number of surveillance cameras has also been increased			2
two years ago , @entity28 ’s then interior minister @entity204 said the vast majority of street robberies in @entity10 were being carried out by the children of @entity31 immigrants from @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity10 is the most popular tourist destination in the world , and the @entity63 are the biggest visitor group — meaning thousands of people from the @entity63 are becoming victims of the gangs			1
and now , with the imminent relaxation of the immigration rules in this country , the gangmasters who run these teenage criminals are setting their sights on @entity63 .			0
