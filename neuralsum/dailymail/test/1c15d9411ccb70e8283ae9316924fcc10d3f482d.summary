depraved militants fighting for the @entity1 in @entity2 have savagely beheaded a man accused of practising sorcery and witchcraft			1
harrowing images of the killing are being shared by bloodthirsty supporters of the terror group on social media and show the victim lying in a pool of blood with his severed head resting on his back			1
one of those distributing the sickening pictures is a man claiming to be a @entity20 militant fighting for the terror group who goes by the nom de guerre @entity22			2
the gruesome photographs are understood to have been taken near @entity25 in @entity2 's @entity27 province , where members of the @entity29 and allied @entity31 volunteer militias have had great success in forcing the terrorists to withdraw in recent weeks			1
@entity54 : one of those distributing the images is a man claiming to be a @entity20 @entity59 jihadi who goes by the nom de guerre @entity62 al - @entity61 the first photo shows the blindfolded and bound man wearing a brown jumpsuit as a bearded terrorist lifts an 18 - inch long kukri machete high into the air ready to behead the defenceless victim			1
a second image far too gruesome to publish in full then shows a close - up of the man 's lifeless body , with his severed head resting on his back			1
it is the exactly the same position @entity20 and @entity74 hostages are placed in after being savagely beheaded by @entity59 ' @entity20 executioner in chief @entity76 , also known as @entity77			0
surrounding the man 's lifeless body are dozens of brightly - coloured prayer beads			1
it is likely the man had been selling the items , which @entity59 terrorists consider bid’ah , meaning a ' reprehensible innovation '			2
as is so often the case with @entity59 ' brutal public executions and amputations , huge crowds are seen in the streets to witness the man 's beheading			1
young men and children and seen lining up in a town square and jostling for position as they struggle to get a better view of the atrocity			2
horror : the execution in @entity27 took place as @entity2 forensic teams working in the nearby , newly liberated city of @entity25 started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers @entity107 task : @entity59 overran @entity109 's hometown last june , capturing the 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee @entity110 - an air base previously used by @entity74 troops on the outskirt of @entity25 the execution in @entity27 province took place as @entity2 forensic teams working in the nearby , newly liberated city of @entity25 started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers brutally murdered by @entity59 last year			1
@entity119 from @entity2 's @entity120 said the work started on monday on eight locations inside @entity25 's complex of presidential palaces , where much of the killing took place			0
@entity59 overran @entity109 's hometown last june , capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee @entity110 , an air base previously used by @entity74 troops on the outskirt of @entity25			0
later , the @entity1 group posted graphic images online that appeared to show its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives onto flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lay face - down in a shallow ditch , their arms tied behind their backs			0
militants fighting for the @entity1 in @entity140 and @entity2 are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in @entity109 's army			2
despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the @entity149 extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos , @entity59 ' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late @entity2 dictator 's military			2
almost all of the regional commanders appointed by @entity59 ' leader and self - declared caliph , @entity158 , played prominent roles in the @entity161 army before the 2003 invasion of @entity2 and became involved with @entity59 either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator 's 2006 death			0
influence : despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the @entity149 extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos , @entity59 ' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of @entity109 one former @entity140 rebel who became an @entity59 regional commander told the @entity171 that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group 's day - to - day business were ex members of @entity109 's @entity161 army			1
during one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an @entity59 meeting , the man calling himself @entity179 was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room , listening and taking notes			0
although the enigmatic commander 's real name was never revealed to him , @entity179 said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the @entity2 army before joining @entity59			0
the same went for the other @entity59 commanders @entity179 met , who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of @entity109 's army			0
as well as their extensive military expertise , another key element of the commanders ' appointments has been the fact the ex-baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to @entity109 's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s			0
crucially , oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of @entity59 ' £ 2 billion - a - year income .			0
