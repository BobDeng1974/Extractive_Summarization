it has been almost 90 years since the electricity pylon as we know it was introduced into the @entity4			1
thousands of the 165ft towers line the land , spoiling scenes of beauty with a cat ’s cradle of high - voltage cables			0
but their days are numbered after a more elegant design was seen in action for the first time yesterday – complete with a pair of distinctive ‘ earrings ’			0
called the t - pylon ( artist 's illustration shown ) it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons			1
but it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts			1
it is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy purposes @entity19 is building a training line of the less obtrusive t - pylons at their @entity33 training academy in @entity34			1
@entity4 's first pylon , erected in july 1928 near @entity36 , was designed by architectural luminary sir @entity37 , inspired by the @entity40 root of the word ‘ pylon ’ ( meaning gateway of an @entity44 temple )			1
the campaign against them - they were unloved even then - was run by @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
five years later , the biggest peacetime construction project seen in @entity4 , the connection of 122 power stations by 4,000 miles of cable , was completed			2
it marked the birth of the @entity19 and was a major stoking of the nation ’s industrial engine and a vital asset during the @entity62			0
there are now more than 88,000 pylons in the @entity4 , including 22,000 on @entity19 ’s main transmission network in @entity66 and @entity67			2
these stand some 50 metres high , weigh around 30 tonnes and carry up to 400,000 volts of electricity over thousands of kilometres to some of the most exposed , weather - beaten parts of @entity4			1
each t - pylon measures about 115ft ( 35 metres ) tall - about a third shorter than the old pylons , which were about 165ft ( 50 metres ) tall			1
the design is a t - shape , with two ‘ hanging baskets ’ either side holding the various wires and cables needed to transmit electricity			0
t - pylons were the winners of a 2011 design competition to develop a new pylon that could deal with changing sources of electricity - namely , greener sources such as wind and solar power			0
‘ we ’ve been able to answer " yes " to the hundreds of questions that need to be asked before we can introduce a new type of pylon , ’ said @entity89 , director of electricity transmission @entity90 at @entity19			0
‘ the training line has enabled us to learn so many lessons about how to manufacture and build the t - pylon			0
‘ i ’m incredibly proud of the high standard of engineering that brought us to this point			0
’ despite being shorter , the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight			1
the simplistic design , composed mostly of just eight components , means new t - pylons can be erected in just a single day , rather than a whole week for older pylons			0
@entity19 is building a training line of six t - pylons at their @entity33 training academy in @entity34 despite being shorter , the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight despite being shorter , the new tower is able to transport a similar amount of power to its predecessor - 400,000 volts - and each arm can support 60 tonnes of weight			1
t - pylons were the winners of a 2011 design competition to develop a new pylon that could deal with changing sources of electricity ( others shown right ) the simplistic design , composed mostly of just eight components , means new t - pylons can be erected in just a single day , rather than a whole week for older pylons maintenance is also easier , as engineers do not need to climb the pylons , but can simply work on them from an elevated platform			0
the new pylons wo n’t replace the 88,000 lattice pylons currently in use ; rather , the @entity19 will use them separately			1
@entity19 plans to use the first operational t - pylons with the @entity144 nuclear power station in @entity145			2
‘ we developed the new type of pylon so that we could have a 21st century design to offer as we plan new transmission routes , ’ added mr @entity89			0
‘ the t - pylon is not a replacement for the steel lattice pylon but it ’s a new option and in some landscapes its shorter height and sleeker appearance can offer real advantages			2

@entity19 has revealed the @entity4 's first new pylon for nearly 90 years
called the t - pylon it is a third shorter than the old lattice pylons
but it is able to carry just as much power - 400,000 volts
it is designed to be less obtrusive and will be used for clean energy
