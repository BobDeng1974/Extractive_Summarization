by @entity0 @entity1 prepared for their @entity3 opener against @entity5 by training hard in @entity6 - with coach @entity7 putting his players through their paces by getting them to weave in and out of giant dummies			0
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 looked sharp and focused as they ran against resistant ropes and then took part in ball skills			1
@entity7 has an injury crisis in defence ahead of their opener on monday and he could be forced to field four centre backs			0
resistant : @entity1 goalkeeper @entity11 tries to pull away from a rope at training in @entity6 looking on : @entity1 coach @entity7 had his players weaving between giant dummies during training slap : low is preparing his @entity1 side for their match - up with @entity5 on monday active : @entity1 are among the favourites for the @entity33 and they are preparing hard knees up : @entity36 ( left ) , @entity13 ( centre ) and @entity35 ( right ) jump up unfamiliar : @entity12 could be forced to play full back against @entity37 @entity12 and @entity38 are expected to play at full back , with @entity39 and @entity40 partnering each other in the centre of defence			1
captain and right back @entity44 is likely to start in midfield - a position for which he has excelled at club side @entity46 - although @entity7 did not rule out the possibility of pushing @entity44 back to full back and playing @entity12 alongside @entity49 in central defence			2
although @entity12 has played full back before , he is more competent at centre back , as is @entity38 who plays there for @entity53 , and they would come up against @entity55 winner @entity37 on the flank			2
at least one of the two is likely to deputise at full back after @entity59 was ruled out of the @entity33 with a knee injury			0
his @entity62 team - mate @entity35 replaced him in the squad but he is in the process of being re-trained as a defender , having started out as a striker , and so is unlikely to be risked			0
@entity67 : @entity38 is another centre back who could be forced to shift out on to the flank game : @entity44 ( left ) and @entity7 take part in a training match ahead of the @entity5 game instructions : @entity1 fitness coach @entity76 directs the players in an exercise during training tactics : low holds out his clipboard as he talks to assistant coach @entity83 during a training session push : @entity11 ( second right ) and his fellow @entity87 squad members train hard header : @entity12 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) watch on during a training match			1
