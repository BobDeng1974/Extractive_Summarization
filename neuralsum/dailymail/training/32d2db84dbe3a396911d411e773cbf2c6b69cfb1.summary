@entity1 's richest men have watched helplessly over the past 48 hours as vast sums of their wealth have evaporated thanks to their crumbling economy			1
@entity6 , a steel magnate who owns a third of @entity10 , and @entity11 , an oil tycoon who owns rival @entity12 , have lost more than £ 800million between them			1
@entity14 , who owns @entity1 's largest supermarket chain , was the biggest loser , seeing £ 900million disappear in two days as the value of the @entity1 rouble tumbled			1
@entity6 ( left ) has lost an estimated £ 500million after the rouble went into meltdown two days ago , while fellow steel magnate @entity19 has lost £ 288million the collapse of @entity1 's currency , which began two days ago after an interest rate hike lead to panic among investors , also threatens @entity1 's stranglehold on the top of the @entity26			1
mr @entity6 , who once topped the @entity28 list , could drop from second to ninth in the table , leaving not a single @entity1 in the top five , compared with 2013 when there were two			2
mr @entity11 , meanwhile , could drop from number nine to number 11 , behind the @entity34 , unless the rouble recovers in the coming days			0
on tuesday the currency lost 20 per cent of its value in just a few hours , dropping to an all - time low of almost 80 roubles per dollar			0
yesterday the value rose and fell sharply , causing @entity39 to suspend online sales and forcing shops to announce sharp price rises , leading to panic buying			0
today the rouble is trading at 61 to the dollar , according to @entity46 , meaning it has gained back a lot of ground but is still below the historic low of 60 which caused the initial panic			0
despite the huge drops in wealth most @entity1 billionaires have seen in the last few days , two men have managed to buck the trend , according to @entity58 ’s @entity57 index			2
@entity59 , who made his fortune selling shares in public assets after the fall of the @entity64 , managed to make £ 117million , leaving him with an estimated fortune of £ 7.6billion			1
meanwhile financial manager @entity67 raked in £ 32million while most of his fellow countrymen lost out			2
in total the 15 richest @entity1 , who control £ 98.6billion between them , lost £ 5.5billion in just 48 hours as @entity1 's economy tumbled causing the largest crisis of @entity74 's leadership			1
president @entity74 is due to give his annual end - of - year address later today , which last year lasted for four hours			0
however the timing could hardly be worse this year and is likely to be completely overshadowed by @entity1 's economic woes			1
the country 's finances have been left in a poor state largely due to a fall in the price of crude oil as @entity85 has flooded the marketplace with reserves , driving value down			0
economic sanctions from @entity90 and the @entity91 over the situation in @entity93 have not helped , with @entity94 due to sign legislation passing new measures in the coming days			0
@entity74 is facing the largest crisis of his leadership after the currency collapsed , with his end - of - year speech today ( pictured ) being overshadowed by the crisis			0

@entity14 , who owns @entity1 's largest supermarket , lost £ 900million
@entity6 and @entity104 loose £ 800million between them
but two shrewd *businessmen* managed to make £ *149.5million* during crisis
