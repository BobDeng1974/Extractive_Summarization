by @entity0 published : 21:16 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 21:55 est , 23 november 2013 murderer : @entity2 , pictured , is in prison having been convicted of 13 murders , but retired officer @entity5 says he could have committed more notorious serial killer @entity2 could be responsible for as many as 17 more murders , a retried detective has claimed			1
@entity5 , formerly of @entity8 , has reviewed dozens of unsolved murders during the period @entity2 was at large , and claims to have found ' circumstantial evidence ' linking him to the crimes			1
he said the ' frenzied nature ' of the killings , whose victims include housewives , prostitutes , a teacher and two pregnant women , leads him to believe @entity2 - also known as the @entity2 - could be behind them			1
although the 13 murders @entity2 was convicted of all took place in @entity22 and @entity23 , mr @entity5 believes his work as a lorry driver could have given him the opportunity to kill all around the country			1
he told the @entity28 sunday : ' i have been able to piece together strands of evidence and i can show that he knew , or had been to , the areas where attacks occurred			0
' i intend to take my evidence to the @entity35 and hope they will reopen the cases			2
' it is inconceivable to believe he did n't attack elsewhere			0
he had the ability to drive around the @entity40 at will and this gave him the perfect cover			0
' mr @entity5 has compiled a dossier of evidence connected to the cases - which date from 1968 to 1980 - and intends to hand it over to the authorities for investigation			1
extra victims ? @entity50 , right , was murdered in 1975			0
@entity5 thinks @entity2 , pictured right driving in his lorry , could have been responsible serial killer : a police document from the ripper investigations shows the 13 whose murders @entity2 has been accused of the murder victims - who are all female - include @entity60 , a 29 - year - old housewife found strangled in north - west @entity61 in 1971 , pregnant mother - of - two @entity57 , who was stabbed repeatedly in 1979 , and teenager @entity58			1
miss @entity50 's body was found discarded in the undergrowth in @entity61 grassland in june 1980			0
two of the victims under mr @entity5 's consideration have never been identified - one of whom was found decapitated in @entity70 in august 1974			1
the other was found on the @entity72			0
the cases identified by mr @entity5 have all baffled investigators			1
a soldier was found guilty of murdering 14 - year - old @entity76 , but the conviction was later quashed by the court of appeal			0
cold case : former intelligence officer @entity5 , above , believes @entity2 can be linked to @entity50 's case a teenager was convicted of the murder of @entity83 , who was killed in @entity84 in 1973 , and spent 27 years in jail , but was eventually cleared of the charge			2
detectives looking in to some of the murders specifically ruled out @entity2 as a suspect at the time			2
but mr @entity5 believes the officers underestimated how far he could travel and how quickly he could kill , which could make him a feasible suspect in the murders			2
@entity2 , now 67 , is a prisoner at @entity96 after being given 20 life sentences .			0

@entity5 , formerly of @entity8 , has compiled evidence
he said the ' frenzied ' killings *suggest* the @entity2 's *involvement*
victims of unsolved cases include teenage girls , teachers and prostitutes
two women have not even been identified
mr @entity5 intends to pass on his evidence to the @entity35
