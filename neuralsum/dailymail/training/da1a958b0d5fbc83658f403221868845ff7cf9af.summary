@entity1 manager @entity0 believes playmaker @entity2 has come into his own in the last few weeks			1
the @entity4 international struggled to find his form in the early part of the season but the @entity10 boss believes that was down to a readjustment process the youngster was going through after the sale of @entity15 and the long - term injury to @entity17			1
however , the installation of @entity19 as a central striker providing pace and movement on the forward line has brought the best out of @entity2 , who produced an influential performance in tuesday 's @entity26 semi-final first leg 1 - 1 draw with @entity29			1
@entity2 ( right ) capped his impressive form of late with a dominant display against @entity29 he has also been helped by the reintroduction of two central midfielders , particularly one as defensively - minded as compatriot @entity34 , as it has relieved some of the responsibility of tracking back			1
' he was outstanding the other night , ' @entity0 said of @entity2			1
' he is that bit of magic who makes that last pass in the final third			2
' last year he had @entity15 and @entity17 to make those passes to but he has n't had that			0
' up until six or seven weeks ago he did n't have that ability to make the threaded pass through			0
' once we had that bit of mobility and speed and movement at the top end of the field - and the others around him - that has really helped him			2
' he is a class act and still has so much development left to make and he is playing very well			0
' with a must - win semi-final second leg against @entity29 coming up on tuesday , @entity0 has to decide just how many changes he can afford to make to rest important players for the @entity64 visit of @entity65 without interrupting the rhythm of a side who look to have finally found their feet			1
@entity0 believes that @entity19 's ( right ) forward role has helped @entity2 hit form @entity0 must decide whether to play the duo against @entity65 in the fourth round of the @entity64 since the turn of the year @entity0 has kept changes to a minimum as , with the exception of @entity79 in the previous round , he has made no more than two alterations to his line - up in their four other matches			1
' we want to progress in the next round			0
i will do what i have done right the way through the season and look at our squad , ' he added			0
' we have some very good players and make some changes but not too many			0
' we have kept it pretty consistent through december and i think the players who have n't been playing have been on the outside looking in seeing how the team has functioned and how well it has functioned			0
' there is always a balance between consistency and rotation but it should n't disrupt the flow of our play so much			0
' wanderers may be 15th in the @entity105 but @entity0 will not under - estimate them as he has been impressed with the turnaround manager @entity107 has affected since taking over in early october			1
@entity107 has recently taken over at @entity65 and @entity0 thinks he will soon be in the @entity108 ' he has been outstanding			1
i was very surprised he did n't get a @entity108 job , ' said the @entity10 boss of his fellow @entity112 and former @entity114 manager			2
' i thought he was primed and set up with his experiences to come into a @entity108 job but unfortunately for him it did n't work out that way			0
' he has gone into @entity65 and done a brilliant job			2
i think they have only lost three times since he went in when they were bottom of the table ' it might be a difficult ask but it would n't surprise me if they got into the play - offs by the end of the season			0
' in the near future @entity107 will be in the @entity108 , either with or without @entity65			1
' he is a good guy , a real thinker of the game , and he has a great career ahead of him in management			2
