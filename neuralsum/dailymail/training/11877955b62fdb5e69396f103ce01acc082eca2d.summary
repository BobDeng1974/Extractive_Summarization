by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 20 august 2013 irritating pains in her head were just something @entity5 had learned to live with , ever since falling off her horse in 2008			1
and in october 2011 - having just competed in the @entity8 @entity7 at @entity9 in @entity10 - the personal trainer and a triathlon coach , 29 , felt like fitness personified			1
but that month @entity5 , from @entity10 , would be given the devastating news that she not only had cancer , but that there was a tumour the size of a satsuma growing on top of her spine , just beneath her brain			1
over the next year @entity5 would undergo surgery that involved her face being cut in half to remove the tumour , followed by gruelling radiotherapy			1
yet nothing has stopped the sports fanatic ; having now made a full recovery she is back at the top of her athletics game and determined to one day compete for @entity34			1
personal trainer and triathlete @entity5 , 29 , from @entity10 , was diagnosed with cancer in october 2011 , and as soon as she was given the all - clear she signed up for the @entity37 @entity5 now , left , and when she was in hospital undergoing treatment for cancer in 2011 and 2012 , right speaking to @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity5 said : ' i 'll never forget the life - changing moment when my doctor told me i had cancer			1
' i was so young and had so many things i still wanted to do with my life			2
so many dreams that i had yet to fulfil			2
i felt so helpless , lost and alone			1
i just cried - i thought i was going to die			1
' at the time of her horse riding accident @entity5 had had an mri scan , but doctors missed the tumour and @entity5 continued to control the pain using painkillers and private physiotherapy treatments			1
but eventually a trip to an @entity60 doctor flagged up the tumour			2
' weirdly , my tongue was the big giveaway : whenever i stuck it out , it used to rotate 90 degrees to the left			2
it was normal to me , but the nurse seemed pretty shocked and gave me a ct scan			2
' when doctors informed her about the satsuma - sized tumour @entity5 says the hardest part was not being told whether she would live or die			1
' i was so young and had so many things i still wanted to do with my life			0
so many dreams that i had yet to fulfil			0
i felt so helpless , lost and alone			2
i just cried - i thought i was going to die ' over the next year , @entity5 underwent two major operations to remove the tumour - the first of which involved cutting her face in half to access the huge lump			1
' thankfully my face did n't look too bad after the operation , and i was just grateful i was alive , ' she said			2
after a second operation fluid began leaking out of her spine - which would have been potentially lethal if it reached her brain - so surgeons had to insert a drain in her back , leaving her in agonising pain and unable to walk for a month			1
eight weeks of radiotherapy followed , sapping @entity5 of all her energy , but in july 2012 she was finally given the all - clear ... and immediately signed herself up for the @entity37 to raise money for children with @entity95			1
' life may seem awful but tomorrow is another day and you 'll get through it			0
life is precious and you really do n't know when your time will be up , so it 's importortant to make every day count ' ' @entity104 is my solace , my savinggrace , ' she said			0
' i needed a new focus			0
@entity95 had consumed my life for the previous 18 months and i wanted something to look forward to			0
i guess i wanted to test my body again , too			0
' @entity5 finished the marathon in 4:20 and raised over Â£ 5,000			0
' i was so emotional when i crossed the finish line , ' she says			0
' i could n't believe that just 10 months previously i could n't walk			0
it just goes to prove that anything really is possible			0
' @entity5 , who is soon getting married , is now determined to qualify as an age - grouper for the @entity116 and represent @entity34			1
and her advice for young sportsmen ? ' never give up , ' she says			0
' life may seem awful but tomorrow is another day and you 'll get through it			0
life is precious and you really do n't know when your time will be up , so it 's importortant to make every day count			0
' read the full interview in @entity42 , out on tuesday 20th august @entity5 ran the @entity129 marathon for @entity130			0
