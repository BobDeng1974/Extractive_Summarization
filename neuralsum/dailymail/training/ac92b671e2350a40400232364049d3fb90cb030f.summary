by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 12 july 2013 @entity2 manager @entity1 has responded to @entity4 ’s latest comments about @entity5 by underlying that the @entity7 striker is not for sale			1
@entity1 had his first press conference of the club ’s tour of @entity12 and @entity13 at @entity15 ’s @entity14 on friday afternoon ahead of his first game as the club ’s manager , against @entity19 on saturday			1
predictably , he was hit by a barrage of questions over @entity5 , who has returned home from tour already with a hamstring problem			1
asked about this , @entity1 said : ' unless i was speaking double @entity36 last week , we said @entity5 is not for sale			1
' people are entitled to talk about good players			2
i 'm getting asked plenty of questions about @entity5			1
' @entity4 has been asked about players as well			1
it 's hard to keep repeating myself but i will - @entity5 is a @entity2 player and it will remain that way			1
' i think @entity4 said , in his comments , that he does n't normally talk about other players			1
' i think i 've covered all of the things on @entity5			1
i 've given you everything about his injury			2
' what you must remember is that @entity2 is a football club and i 've got a team , and this is not about any one individual			1
' i many ways , i 'm only interested in the team			2
i will answer questions on @entity5 but some of them are just reverting back to things i 've covered			1
' big issue : @entity1 talking in the press conference about @entity5 sent home : @entity5 has left @entity2 's tour of @entity67 with a hamstring injury @entity29 are thought to be among those interested in taking @entity5 with the striker yet to commit his future to @entity2 and now @entity4 has insisted he is a player he ' likes very much '			1
' it ’s a funny trick question , ' @entity4 said			1
' from an ethical point of view i can not speak about other team ’s players			2
but i wo n’t speak with hypocrisy			0
it ’s not in my nature			0
i always speak what i think			0
' he is a player i like very much but i ca n’t say much more			0
he is fast and direct and i like him			0
but he is a @entity2 player			1
' @entity5 signed for @entity2 in 2004 , the same summer @entity4 arrived at @entity29			1
departing : and @entity5 may yet also be on his way out of @entity85 the @entity87 manager left @entity32 in 2007 , however , only returning this summer , but he believes the club have appointed a better boss second time around			1
' i am better now , ' he said			0
' experience matters a lot and age and my years around @entity94 – two years in @entity95 and three in @entity96 – makes me better coach			0
i am in better condition than i was last time			0
' i have some white hairs but in my case that ’s a good sign			0
it means i am better now than before			0
i am still very sad and unhappy when my team does n’t win , it 's up to the players to help me get the results that i want and i need			0
' this means much more than a football club			0
its more than being a professional			0
' video @entity4 press conference in @entity15 respectful : @entity4 , @entity113 , @entity114 and more have arrived in @entity15 the special one : the fans have made no secret about who their main attraction is in the shade ? @entity4 's rarely known for taking a back seat @entity5 is already back in @entity122 after @entity2 ’s medical staff assessed an injury he actually picked up before he left			1
the good news is that @entity1 now believes he may be back in action in three weeks , in time for the start of the season			1
' it 's a blow that we 've lost him because he 's been training well and looking very good , ' said @entity1			1
' but unfortunately he just felt something in his hamstring			2
' we did a check and found a slight grade one injury there , which will probably keep him out for about two to three weeks			2
tight - lipped : @entity1 talking during his press conference in @entity15 ' so i do n't foresee any problem with @entity5 starting the season and being fit for then			1
' he did n't train the last little bit before we ca , e. he just felt his hamstring tighten , so we pulled him out and did n't think anything of it			2
' it was only when we got here we knew we were n't going to train him yesterday , and we thought , as a precaution , we would check it out			2
' when we went to check it we saw a small grade one [ tear ]			0
we could maybe have taken him on to all the other places , but he could n't have played the games			0
' so for the benefit of the player the best thing to do was to get him home straight away and quickly into his rehabilitation			2
' remember , when we return from this tour we 've still got games in @entity161 , @entity163 's testimonial and the @entity164 , so he can play in those games			0
' it 's important we get players fit for those games			0
' we did n't expect it			0
but what would be the point in taking any risks ? there 's no point in taking any risks			0
' we 'll keep his work up			0
with hamstring injuries , you can do work in the pool , you can do work in the gym			2
