by @entity0 a grandfather given 18 months to live after he was diagnosed with leukaemia has had his life saved by two umbilical cords			0
@entity5 , 60 , underwent a remarkable stem cell transplant using the babies ’ cords after all other treatments were exhausted			1
patients with cancers such as leukaemia need blood stem cells to replace their own damaged cells and cells taken from babies ' donated cords can now be used for bone marrow transplants			1
hope : @entity5 ( with wife @entity19 ) , underwent a stem cell transplant for his leukeamia using blood from umbilical cords after all other treatments were exhausted the cords are rich in stem cells , which can grow into healthy blood			1
and because newborns have not been exposed to infections , their stem cells are less likely to attack the immune system			2
mr @entity5 said : ' i was truly amazed when my doctor at the @entity34 in @entity35 said we could use this option			1
' to think that two newborns saved an old man ’s life is just marvellous and it ’s given me more time with my own grandchildren			0
' the father - of - four and grandfather - of - seven , from @entity45 , @entity46 , was diagnosed with leukaemia following routine blood tests in august 2012			0
he began chemotherapy and blood transfusions and in 2012 , a search for a stem cell donor was launched			1
but no members of his family proved a match and no other donors could be found - leaving him with a life expectancy of around 12 to 18 months			0
cord blood is taken from a baby 's umbilical cord soon after birth			1
a machine is used to spin the blood and separate off the stem cells			2
these are then frozen until needed ( the rest of the blood is discarded )			0
once a match has been found , the patient has chemotherapy , and sometimes radiotherapy , to destroy their cancerous white blood cells			0
during the transplant , relatively few stem cells are used - around 100ml - which are given like a blood transfusion			1
once in the bloodstream , the cells find their way to the bone marrow and start producing healthy blood cells			1
patients spend several weeks in hospital while their immune system recovers			0
then last september , he underwent the transplant using stem cells from the umbilical cords of a baby born in @entity91 and one born in @entity92			1
the childrens ' parents had already agreed to allow the stems cells to be harvested and banked with a view to helping save another person ’s life			0
the two donor babies were found to be a good match and their cells were flown to the @entity34			2
the technique is available on the @entity103 and the hospital has carried out six similar transplants in the past year			0
mr @entity5 said : ' things were looking pretty grim until i got the news about the possibility of an umbilical cord stem cell transplant			1
' the team from the @entity112 found two separate umbilical cord donors that were a good match			0
' it was something to hope for - like a lifeline was being thrown to you			0
i grabbed it with both hands and hoped for the best			0
' during the procedure , mr @entity5 spent six weeks in hospital			2
stem cells from the second cord began to work and his condition slowly began to improve			2
dr @entity127 , director of the haematology and transplant unit at @entity34 , said : ' umbilical cord blood is very rich in stem cells , which being so immature has phenomenal regenerative powers ' these were a great , alternative source of cells for @entity5 - in fact the only option - as after a worldwide search he had no other available donor			1
' relief : mr @entity5 said : ' to think that two newborns saved an old man 's life is just marvellous and it 's given me more time with my own grandchildren ' the first line of treatment in cancer of the blood is chemotherapy , but if that fails then doctors consider a bone marrow transplant			1
around 1,100 patients in @entity157 have these transplants every year - mainly for leukaemia but also for disorders such as sickle cell anaemia			2
a good match is important if the patient 's body is not to reject the healthy donor bone marrow			1
dr @entity127 , director of the haematology and transplant unit at @entity34 , said the cord blood was mr @entity5 's last option thirty per cent of patients find a match among their relatives ; another 50 per cent are successfully matched with donors from bone marrow registers			1
in recent years , it has been discovered that blood taken from babies ’ umbilical cords and placentas is rich in life - saving stem cells that can be used for transplants			1
but around 65,000 litres of cord blood are still discarded following births in @entity157			0
it is estimated that around 400 patients miss out on vital treatment because of a lack of suitable stem cell donors			2
if 50,000 units of cord blood were saved , 80 per cent of transplant requests in @entity157 could be met			2
an increasing number of pregnant women here are being asked if they want to donate their baby ’s umbilical cord and placenta			0
the blood is also collected in countries including the @entity91 , @entity201 , @entity92 and @entity202			0
it is totally risk - free and does not interfere with the baby ’s delivery			0
the blood is collected from the umbilical cord by a specialist nurse shortly after a baby has been born			0
the @entity210 , @entity157 ’s blood cancer charity and bone marrow register , hosts a collection centre in @entity214 where cord blood is stored			1
it collects cord blood at hospitals in @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 and aims to collect 15,000 cord blood units by the end of this year			2
cord blood can also be donated through the @entity103 at six hospitals in @entity219			1
the @entity103 has its own cord blood bank in @entity227 , which contains more than 20,000 units			1

the transplant was @entity5 's last hope after other treatments failed
leukemia patients need new blood stem cells to replace damaged ones
mr @entity5 , 60 , *urgently* needed a stem cell donor but no one was a match
cells taken from babies ' donated cords can be used for bone marrow transplants - and are less likely to be rejected by the body
cord blood can also be donated through the @entity103 at various hospitals
