@entity0 has exonerated referee @entity1 from any blame over @entity5 flanker @entity4 's unpunished stamp on @entity8 debutant @entity7 's face			1
@entity4 is expected to receive a citing after stamping on @entity9 back - rower @entity7 's face during @entity8 's 49 - 7 win over the @entity12 in @entity13 on sunday			1
referee @entity1 waved away @entity8 captain @entity16 's requests for a @entity19 ( @entity18 ) review , saying ' i ca n't listen to that ' during the six - try victory			1
@entity0 refused to blame the referee for failing to punish @entity4 's stamp on @entity7 @entity7 ( second left ) was making his @entity8 debut in the test match against @entity5 @entity8 boss @entity0 backed @entity1 for not referring the incident , suggesting @entity18 @entity28 should have alerted the referee to potential foul play			1
' i think the protocol is that if there is suspected foul play the @entity18 can intervene , he can let the referee know and then the referee can review it , ' said @entity0			1
' obviously the incident had passed , and i think by the time @entity16 spoke to the referee the game had moved on a little bit , and he heard nothing from the @entity18			2
' so according to the protocol i think he acted correctly			1
there 's not really much else that @entity1 could have done			1
that 's just the way it works			2
' it 's something that i know is being talked about a fair bit : they may change those protocols at some stage			0
' currently his ( @entity1 's ) hands were tied a little bit : he did n't see it himself personally , @entity54 on the touchline did n't see it			1
@entity1 was in charge of the encounter but acted to protocol according to @entity8 coach @entity0 @entity8 's @entity59 scores a try against @entity5 during their 49 - 7 win in @entity13 ' therefore if there was an incident then that has to be dealt with by the @entity18 pretty much in close proximity in time , otherwise once the game goes on it 's pretty hard to go a long way back			1
' it did n't look great at the end of it , but i did n't see how it occurred			0
@entity72 is a game where things can happen			0
it 's one of those things we 'll have a look at and i do n't think we 'll be the only ones			0
' but for me i 'm pretty keen just to move on from it and leave it on the pitch			0
' @entity9 flanker @entity7 somehow escaped serious injury in a first half where @entity8 botched a host of try - scoring chances			1
@entity59 grabbed a second - half brace , with @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 completing the eventual rout			0
@entity92 claimed @entity5 's sole score in a testing day for the world 's 15th - ranked test side			1
@entity5 's @entity97 is tackled during the @entity98 at the @entity99 @entity8 's @entity100 ( left ) is tackled by @entity5 's @entity101 during the clash @entity9 scrum - half @entity16 , captaining @entity8 for the first time , also refused to lay any criticism at referee @entity1 , but admitted he believes world rugby chiefs may tinker with the @entity18 rules			1
@entity16 said he believes the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) are examining whether to hand teams a number of @entity18 review requests per match			0
' basically i asked him to have a look at it , and he said he was n't in a position to do so , ' said @entity16			0
' @entity7 , his eye was sore , he just asked me to ask the ref to have a look at it			2
i asked the ref , he said he was n't in a position to do that , so ... ' i think the powers that be are on top of it and they are talking about it			0
at the end of the day he 's got to make his decision based on that			0
' if there 's something very , very bad there maybe the assistant referee should step in , and maybe the @entity18 can look at it himself			2
that would be where i am on that			0
' at the same time the game 's got to flow and it 's up to the referees and the powers that be to make sure that happens			0
' @entity5 's @entity146 boss @entity145 conceded that @entity4 will now in all probability face disciplinary action			1
' i certainly saw it on the replay , ' said @entity145			2
' i know @entity4 and he certainly would n't be doing anything like that intentionally			2
we 'll have to wait to hear from the citing commissioner			0
we got taught a couple of lessons			0
