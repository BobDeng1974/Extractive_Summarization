@entity6 did not breathe for 20 minutes after he was born and mother @entity8 was warned that even if he survived he would be severely brain damaged from lack of oxygen			1
but then he was given revolutionary treatment to cool his core body temperature , putting him a state of induced hypothermia , in the hope it would allow his brain to recover			1

' when they finally handed me a warm bundle to hold for the first time it felt like a true @entity39 miracle that he had survived			2
' the treatment was such a success that @entity6 was allowed home on @entity43 and @entity8 says : ' to see your baby cold and shivering goes against all your mothering instincts			1
you just want to wrap them up and keep them warm , but it saved his life			2
words can not express how grateful we are			2

@entity6 was rushed to the @entity81 , near the couple ’s home in @entity84 , while one of the midwives tended to @entity8			1
five minutes later she had a call from the ambulance crew saying @entity6 had finally started breathing 20 minutes after his birth			1

' nurses assured me he could n’t feel anything because he was sedated but i had to fight the urge to wrap him up and snuggle him			0
' the parents kept vigil over the next few days as @entity39 loomed			0
@entity8 , a bookshop manager , says : ' it was heartbreaking because i had bought him a little @entity132 suit and imagined us all at home together for his first @entity39			0
' now all i could do was pray that he would live			0
i did n’t even think about @entity39			0
' after 72 hours it was time to slowly warm @entity6 up			1
only then could they tell if the treatment had worked			0
@entity56 , 29 , a lettings manager , says : ' we were warned it was a critical time as he might suffer a seizure or relapse			0
' miraculously as he ' defrosted ' over the next 12 hours @entity6 started to move his legs and cry — signs that he had not suffered brain damage			1
@entity8 says : ' the doctors could not believe it			0
he had been deprived of oxygen for 20 minutes			1
it was unheard of for him to be responding so well			0
' finally , at 4pm on @entity152 , the couple were able to hold their baby for the first time			0
@entity8 says : ' tears were rolling down my face			0
he was still covered in wires and tubes but he was warm , his heart was beating			0
' after what i had witnessed when he was born it felt like a true @entity39 miracle			2
it was like he had been brought back to life			0
