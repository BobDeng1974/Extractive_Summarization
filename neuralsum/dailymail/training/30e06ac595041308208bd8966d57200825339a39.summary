when @entity2 the cat was found abandoned in a box on the side of the road in july - he was too sick to eat , and his fur was so long that it required emergency surgery to shear it all off			1
the neglected moggy , found on @entity9 , north @entity10 , was rushed to the nearby @entity11 where vets set about removing his horrendously matted coat			1
they also had to fix his broken jaw and remove most of his teeth as they were badly rotted away - but the animal has since made a full recovery and been adopted by the clinic 's vet , who calls him a ' celebrity at the practice '			1
@entity45 from the animal that was rushed in , the moggy was captured groggily awakening on the operating table , next to a huge ball of fur , which vets jokingly heaped into a ball and gave eyes			2
after bravely pulling through , @entity2 was nursed back to health by the team at @entity11 in @entity31 , north west @entity10			1
his coat will take a few months to regrow so he has been wearing a jumper knitted for him by the mother of one of the practice 's receptionists			2
and rather than being rehomed , @entity2 has been adopted by vet @entity59 and his family , who live above the surgery			2
close shave : the moggy is barely recognisable from the cat that was rushed into surgery and he is now said to be on the mend after having life - saving surgery neglected : @entity2 's fur had become horribly matted after years living rough - the unfortunate cat also needed most of his teeth pulled out as they had rotted away @entity59 , 38 , said : ' @entity2 arrived at our practice a couple of months ago in a terrible state			1
he had been rescued by the @entity74 after being abandoned in a box on @entity9			0
' his fur was so matted he could n't do anything and his teeth were so rotted his jaw had fractured			2
he could barely eat or drink			0
' he was really dehydrated and full of infection , and just in a horrendous condition			0
he could have died if he had n't have been found			0
recovering : @entity2 's appearance is slightly alarming because vets had to give him such a close shave - to keep him warm they knitted him a jumper ( right ) ' we anaesthetised him and shaved off all his fur			1
i had to pull out most of his teeth because they were so rotten and then i wired his lower jaw back together			1
' it was touch and go at that point			0
@entity2 needed intensive care and had to be fed through a syringe so we kept him in for a few weeks			0
' in the end my wife and i decided to keep him ourselves			0
we already have three cats so it was no bother to us			0
almost there : @entity102 said ' it was touch and go - @entity2 needed intensive care and had to be fed through a syringe so we kept him in for a few weeks ' happy again : after making a big impression , the resilient cat has now been adopted by vet @entity59 and his family , who live above the surgery ' it was then just a case of slowly nursing him back to health with good food and lots of rest			1
' the transformation has been amazing - in the last month or so his character has started to come out and he 's getting much more bold			1
' he 's become a real celebrity at the practice			1
it will take about three more months before his hair is fully regrown again but he 's doing ok considering we shaved him bald			0
job done : veterinary workers , @entity127 and @entity128 , pose with @entity2 after his successful surgery at the @entity11 in north west @entity10 ' the mother of one of our receptionists knitted him a little jumper to keep him warm in the meantime , and it 's noticeable how much happier he is with it on			1
' @entity2 looks comical and his story has had a happy ending but behind it all there 's quite a serious case of neglect			0
' we have to thank the @entity74 who brought @entity2 to us after rescuing him			0
they work very closely with them and they do fantastic work in our area			0
' celebrity cat : @entity2 , pictured in a jumper knitted by the practice receptionist 's mother , has become extremely bold and is treated like a celebrity at the clinic			2
