' i find the controversy about my compensation deeply disturbing , ' he said row : marketing guru sir @entity4 , ceo of @entity5 , is at loggerheads with some of his shareholders over his potential £ 29 million pay package one of @entity10 's top businessman has defended his potential £ 29million pay packet by saying it is ' right ' he is paid that much as the backlash against boardroom greed engulfed him today			1
sir @entity4 , chief executive of advertising giant @entity5 , is facing a showdown with his own shareholders and said their anger is ' deeply disturbing '			1
senior executives at several of @entity10 's most successful companies and banks have faced an outpouring of anger from ordinary investors over their multi-million pound pay and bonuses , now being called the ' @entity26 '			0
and this uprising against fat cat pay deals appears to be heading for sir @entity4			0
@entity30 , who own 20 per cent of the company 's shares , say its investors should vote against his pay deal and some other large shareholders plan to do the same on june 13			1
but in a robust defence of his salary and benefits , just a week before @entity5 's annual meeting , sir @entity4 has warned that @entity10 must ensure people in its private sector are as well paid as those in @entity44 and @entity45			1
@entity5 has increased its pre-tax profits by almost a fifth to £ 1 billion in the last year , and so senior executives like him should be rewarded , he said			1
' the compensation debate in the @entity10 now seems to have shifted , from undeserving bankers paid for failure and from payment for performance , to what is fair pay , ' he wrote in the @entity56 today			2
' i find the controversy over my compensation deeply disturbing			1
some imagine that i wake up every morning and make decisions including those over compensation in the shaving mirror			0
' the board 's compensation decisions are right because they reward performance , not failure			0
' i thought the object of the exercise was to behave like an entrepreneur not a bureaucrat			0
' he continued that he had built up the company himself and staked his own money to make it a success , adding @entity5 had ' materially outperformed the @entity77 ' last year and made shareholders a lot of money			1
@entity4 , who was paid £ 13million last year , has seen his base salary increase by 30 per cent to £ 1.3million , his target bonus has increased from 167 per cent to 250 per cent and his maximum bonus has increased from 300 per cent to 500 per cent			0
in total , shareholder advisory service @entity84 said @entity4 could get £ 29million over 5 years , if he invests £ 4.55million in the company ’s share - based bonus scheme			0
his battle could become a test case for how much @entity10 executives should be paid , experts are claiming			0
last month bosses at insurance giant @entity94 were left humiliated after their multi-million pound bonuses were rejected by investors at their annual meeting			0
test : if it rumbles on sir @entity4 's row with shareholders could form a test case for what top @entity10 senior executives , most of whom are in the @entity107 , pictured , should be paid @entity109 has also received a bloody nose , with 31.4 per cent of shareholders failing to back its pay and perks			2
this included a package of up to £ 26.6million for its chief executive @entity117			0
while mining giant @entity119 received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report , which sanctioned a package worth £ 6million for its boss @entity123			0
and @entity125 , chief executive of @entity127 newspaper group , was forced out after weeks of criticism from investors and shareholders about her £ 1.7million pay package			2
and now @entity5 's shareholders are threatening not to vote sir @entity4 's package through			1
@entity5 's major investors are predicting a revolt with at least three of the group ’s top ten shareholders preparing to vote against the pay and perks due to @entity4			1
chairman @entity140 and @entity141 , who heads its remuneration committee , have written to shareholders claiming that @entity5 has ‘ not been insensitive to current economic conditions ’ , but that the pay rise ‘ reflects the board ’s commitment to pay for performance ’			1
shareholders will vote on june 13 on @entity4 ’s pay arrangements at the annual meeting in @entity152 , where @entity5 moved to in 2008 to be outside the tax jurisdiction of @entity10			1
in response to sir @entity4 's views , shareholder @entity30 said today : ' our investor clients are quite clear that companies can not cherry - pick benchmarks to justify inappropriate pay			0
' sources close to the company suggest @entity5 might even consider quitting the @entity165 stock market if investors vote against the proposals in sufficient numbers ahead of the vote on executive remuneration being made binding as the government plans in 2014			2
such a move would be hugely embarrassing for the government after it claimed last year that its business - friendly policies would persuade @entity5 to return to @entity165 , something @entity4 confirmed earlier this year .			2

the ceo of @entity5 faces a battle with shareholders to get his pay voted through next week
