@entity0 is relishing the challenge of taking the next step in his football education under the watchful eye of @entity5			1
the 24 - year - old winger was belatedly handed a top - flight debut as a substitute by @entity10 's head coach in last weekend 's opening day 2 - 2 draw at @entity13 some seven months after the @entity14 had hoped to be able to do so			1
@entity5 was unable to prise @entity0 away from former club @entity15 in january , where he had helped the midfielder to make the transition from @entity19 to the @entity20 , but launched a successful £ 2.5million bid earlier this month			1
buckled in : will @entity0 is looking forward to facing @entity22 and improving under @entity5 on sunday , @entity0 will hope to test himself against @entity22 at the @entity23 confident that @entity5 can help him to fulfil his dreams			1
he said : ' obviously , everyone knows what he did as a player but i have worked under him now for over two years and his passion just comes across to the players in a good way			2
' he just gets the best out of me			0
hopefully he improves players , that 's one of his qualities , and hopefully i can carry on improving now i have joined here as well			0
' here for the long haul : @entity0 was signed for £ 2.5 million this summer after an unsuccessful bid in january @entity0 's rise has been steady , but impressive - he was playing his football with @entity40 in @entity19 when @entity41 handed him the chance to experience life in the @entity20 in january 2010			1
by his own admission , the progression was not straightforward , but he adapted to such an extent that within 18 months , @entity15 were prepared to invest £ 1million in his services			0
he said : ' when i went from @entity19 to the championship , for the first couple of months , i actually struggled , then i saw myself improving day to day			0
hopefully that can be the same with the @entity52			0
' re-united : will @entity0 played under @entity5 at @entity15 and is confident he will get the best out of him @entity0 had 17 minutes as an emergency right - back at the @entity55 to assess just how much he has to learn as he makes his latest step forward , but one difference between the @entity52 and the @entity20 was immediately apparent			1
he said : ' they let you have the ball a little bit more comfortably , but when it gets to that final third , it 's going to be more difficult to create goals and score goals , which everyone wants to do			0
' @entity5 has few doubts @entity0 , who followed former @entity15 team - mate @entity68 to the @entity23 , will rise to the challenge as he looks to inject pace and flair into his team			1
the @entity74 tended to play with a lone striker last season with the likes of @entity78 and @entity79 - the @entity73 remains tantalisingly out of the club 's grasp as the close of the transfer window looms - providing support			0
a similar role would hold no fears for @entity0 , who admits his instinct is to attack			2
he said : ' growing up , i was always a striker but when i first broke on to the professional scene , i started playing as a winger and that 's probably my best position now			2
' i can play up front , but as a winger is probably where @entity5 has bought me to play			2
' with the three he plays up there , it 's interchanging and you get to play all along the front three , so i am comfortable playing in any one of those positions			0

will @entity0 was handed his @entity10 debut against @entity13
@entity0 is looking forward to *renewing* his relationship with @entity5
the 24 year old winger hopes to face @entity22 on sunday
