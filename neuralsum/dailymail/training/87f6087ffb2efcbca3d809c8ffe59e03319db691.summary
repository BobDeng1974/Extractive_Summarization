by @entity1 reporter published : 11:40 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 04:22 est , 28 september 2012 two newborn babies have died after contracting a rare killer bug which swept through a neonatal unit			1
the unit has now been closed and deep cleaned after staff discovered deadly bacteria at the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) which left five other babies fighting for their lives			1
the worrying outbreak infected seven children in total - four have now been allowed to return home while another remains in intensive care			0
the @entity18 department at @entity8 after the bug was detected in july the hospital continued to admit babies born in the centre , although it closed to admissions from other hospitals			1
now a review of practices at the hospital by the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is underway			0
post-mortem examinations on the babies , both born before 28 weeks , found they died from the @entity33 bacteria			1
further tests on the surviving newborns showed the infection had been picked up while on the ward			0
the surviving infants were found to be carriers of the bug and did not suffer the illness itself			0
but they were placed in isolation incubators while their treatment continued for conditions linked to be being born prematurely			0
@entity33 is a rod - shaped pathogen involved in hospital infections last night , chief executive @entity48 said : ' we identified the infection in our @entity51 ( @entity51 )			1
it can affect babies born extremely premature			2
' sadly two babies who died , both born before 28 weeks , had this uncommon infection and postmortems confirmed @entity33 as the cause of death			1
' the families of the two babies were informed at the time of this infection			2
' @entity9 infection experts said the parents of babies already discharged had no need to worry			2
consultant microbiologist dr @entity67 said : ' as a precaution we temporarily closed @entity51 to new admissions			2
' the five other babies who were carrying the organism , but not unwell , were isolated			0
' one of those continues to be treated on the unit for other conditions and will remain here until well enough to go home			0
' in addition we carried out a deep clean of neonatal intensive care and reviewed infection prevention practice immediately with assistance from the @entity28			1
vulnerable : neonatal units specialise in the care of ill or premature babies ( file picture ) ' further tests on the organisms isolated performed by the @entity28 confirmed an outbreak			0
' the unit introduced enhanced contact isolation and weekly @entity94 have been no new cases of infection of babies carrying the organism since the initial cases were first identified in july			2
' all the families with babies on the @entity51 at the time that the infection was identified were kept fully informed			0
' @entity33 is found in the stomach and bowel of children and can cause serious illness in premature babies .			1
