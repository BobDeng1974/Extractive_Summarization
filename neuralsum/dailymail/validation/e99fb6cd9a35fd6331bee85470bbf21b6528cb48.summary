the @entity10 leader , who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities , was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife @entity14 in a modest kitchen at his £ 2million @entity17 home			1

for mr @entity4 actually lives in a house with two kitchens			1
the godmother to one of mr @entity4 's children tonight revealed that the kitchen @entity4 and his wife were pictured in was in fact a ' functional kitchenette ' next to the family 's sitting room @entity34 , a newspaper columnist , said the kitchen mr @entity4 was pictured in was used for ' tea and quick snacks ' and insisted the family 's main kitchen was ' lovely ' the poky room the couple were pictured in , albeit with an oven and hob , was revealed last night by a family friend to be a ' functional kitchenette ' for ' tea and quick snacks '			1
the revelation opened up the @entity10 leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is , even though his home is reputed to be worth £ 2.5million			0

she wrote : ' very rarely do i feel sorry for @entity4 , but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen , staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue - and - white mug , part of me wanted to rush home from work , sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home - made brownies			2
' surely that ca n't really be @entity4 and @entity14 's kitchen ? all that lovely huge , fancy house , and that is where they do their cooking ? ' i hope for their sake that it 's actually their utility room , and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their £ 2million - plus townhouse in @entity17 's trendy @entity105 look less fabulous and to bolster @entity4 's man - o ' - the - people image			1
' in his @entity108 card last year , mr @entity4 posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen mrs @entity113 , a child actress - turned - barrister , is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run - up to polling day yesterday this prompted @entity34 , the @entity121 political commentator and family friend , to come to the @entity9 's defence – by revealing his actual kitchen is ' lovely '			1
