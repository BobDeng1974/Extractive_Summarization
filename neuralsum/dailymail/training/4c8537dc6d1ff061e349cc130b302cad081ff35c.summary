by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 19:52 est , 24 october 2012 having a bad memory for faces is a common problem			2
but sisters @entity4 and @entity6 have had to cope all their lives without recognising anyone – even themselves			1
despite having normal eyesight the women suffer from an extreme form of ' face blindness			2
their condition , prosopagnosia , has been known for decades , although little is understood about how it is caused			1
it appears the sisters from @entity34 never developed the visual mechanisms in the brain required for face processing and simply can not do something we all take for granted			2
mrs @entity6 , 32 , can not describe what her husband @entity41 's face looks like			1
she said : ' i can make out an eye or a nose , but when i try and look at a whole face it just does n't work			2
it 's like a blank canvas on someone 's head			0
the sisters have suffered with the condition their whole lives but were only diagnosed a few years ago			1
pictured @entity54 ( back ) with @entity4 ( right ) and their brother ' people will come up to me who i 've known for years , but until they introduce themselves i have no idea who they are			1
' she was diagnosed by chance a few years ago when her doctor came into the coffee shop where she worked and she failed to recognise him			0
her 30 - year - old sister then realised she also had the condition , which can run in families			1
@entity69 , an office worker with a 14 - year - old daughter , @entity70 , said : ' i 'd always thought i just was n't paying enough attention , so in a way it was a relief to know that something was wrong			1
' i even find it hard to pick out my daughter from a crowd			0
' i feel guilty – i should know what my own child looks like – but i just find it impossible			0
' it certainly makes her relationship with partner @entity84 , 40 , a bit different			0
she said : ' when i saw him for the first time i immediately thought that he looked like a lovely person , and every time i look at him i still get that feeling			0
' growing up , the sisters found ways to recognise their parents			0
the condition is so bad that the sisters , from @entity97 , are unable to recognise even their own reflections the condition means that the sisters rarely go out alone together , for fear of losing each other @entity54 with her husband at her wedding , who she struggles to recognise miss @entity4 said : ' my mum wore bright neon colours all the time , and she always made my dad wear homemade knitted jumpers so it was easy to spot them in a crowd			1
@entity114 had waist - length hair too			0
' however , on one hiking trip when everyone was wearing similar outdoor clothing , the younger sister walked off with the wrong family			0
the biggest problem comes in recognising themselves			0
miss @entity4 recalled stepping from side to side repeatedly to avoid a woman in a corridor only to discover she was trying to walk into a mirror			1
and while mrs @entity6 was a bar manager , she shouted at a woman standing in her way as she carried empty glasses and realised she was arguing with her own reflection .			2

@entity4 and @entity6 suffer from prosopagnosia
condition is so bad that the sisters are n't sure of their own *appearance*
spend hours searching for each other - or *friends* and family - if they get separated
