by @entity0 @entity2 creams have been a hot topic in the beauty industry over the last few years because of their promises to roll back the years			2
first there were products containing wrinkle - busting ingredients for your skin , then anti-ageing unguents for your hair - and now there 's even one for your nails			1
@entity16 brand @entity15 has launched what they say is an industry first with their bb creme for nails			1
new concern : now we have to worry about the ageing appearance of our nails but @entity15 's creme promises to roll back the years @entity2 stands for blemish base and the facial creams are said to make your skin look younger , smoother and brighter			1
they double up as both a moisturiser and primer			0
some even have sun protection			0
@entity15 has taken the multi-functional concept and applied it to nails with its new product - it will hit shelves in august at £ 15 a bottle			1
it says the ingredients in its bb creme for nails - which include @entity42 and @entity44 - will prime , brighten and smooth nails			2
it recommend applying two coats to bare nails to keep them hydrated and protected from uv rays			2
this should delay the process of nails becoming brittle as they age			2
it is not intended to be used as a basecoat or topcoat with nail polish - but presumably regular use would encourage a smooth base for when varnish is applied			0
@entity61 brittle nails : the new product promises to make nails look smoother and brighter if you decide to keep your nails unpainted , the creme will give them a ' natural glow '			1
but when we 've already got facial wrinkles and greying , thinning hair to fret about , do we really need to worry about the effect of ageing on the appearance of our nails too ? yes , says beauty blogger really ree who has welcomed the arrival of the product			1
she writes : ' personally , i get very excited by the way that skincare approaches are being applied to much more than just our skin			0
we can now have the same care for hair and nails too			1
' i am thinking that a @entity2 for teeth is either on its way , or already exists			0
i have always wanted to look after my hair like i look after my skin , and it makes sense to do the same with nails too			1
' she added : ' i have accepted that my hair ages just like my skin does , and i think i have always known that nails age , too			1
i just never really thought about trying to stop them			0
' @entity100 , an expert at vanityvan.co.uk says that condition of our nails can say a lot about the rest of our body and we should be concerned about them ageing			1
' just as the body ages , nails do too			2
changes are apparent in the skin , nails ( fingers and toes ) and hair			1
just think of why doctors always examine your nails , or when you go into surgery			0
. they give away a lot			0
' @entity100 says that spotting signs of aging in your nails can be easier than it sounds and there are a few obvious things to look out for			0
' nails becoming brittle and change colour , the clarity on the nail is affected , while vertical ridges can form , and they become thinner and break more easily			0
they look drier and take longer to recover from any injury like bruising			0
' @entity100 believes that the @entity138 is a real innovation and could dramatically help change the health of our nails			0
' there is nothing of this intensity on the market and why should n't there be ? there are @entity149 for the face - nails are also susceptible and people take them for granted			1
' this is a genius product for plumping the nail structure , whitening so to avoid the discolouration that comes with ageing , brightening so they look great with no nail varnish - even though it has a pearlescent sheen so can be worn alone			1
' it also has smoothing and anti chip properties which , in the long run , will help people whose nails have been damaged by cheap nail enhancing , ageing and illness			2
did i forget to mention it protects your nails from uv rays			0
' @entity173 is available at @entity174 from august 2014 , sign up for the product 's waiting list here : @entity178			0
