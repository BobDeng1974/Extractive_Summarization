by @entity0 scientists are appealing to the public to help track down a giant slug which has been invading @entity4 from @entity5			1
the @entity5 slug is thought to have arrived here on salad leaves but has bred rapidly - laying up to 400 eggs each - threatening @entity4 crops			1
the invasion has been slowed by frosts in may which killed thousands of them , but scientists are so concerned they have launched slugwatch.co.uk and are asking the public to help track them			2
the @entity5 slug , pictured , is invading @entity4 threatening crops and native species			2
they can grow up to 6in long and produce 400 eggs each the pests eat dead animals , excrement and even their own species			1
they can grow up to 6in long , lay 400 eggs each , eat crops usually spared by our native slugs and can survive poison pellets			1
the @entity31 website contains information on how to trap the animals and print out kits which help identify them and has been launched to coincide with @entity4 @entity35			0
the biggest fear is that they will breed with native slugs , giving them a greater resistance to cold weather while keeping their keen appetite			1
when the species first appeared in @entity46 a few years ago they bred so quickly that squashed slugs on roads caused serious traffic problems			0
the species was first spotted in the @entity4 in 2012 by dr @entity51 , head of entomology at the @entity53			0
he counted 350 of them in just one day and when he saw some eating a dead mouse he decided to send samples for identification			0
the species turned out to be @entity59 , otherwise known as the @entity5 slug			2
they are thought to have travelled here on imported trees , pot plants or salad leaves			0
in an interview with @entity68 dr @entity51 said : ' the @entity5 slug is a voracious predator that can survive eating many of the slug pellets that are supposed to kill them			2
the slugs eat crops which are usually left untouched by native species and have so far only been stopped by the cold weather ' we want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the @entity5 slug is			1
' most slugs play an important part in the ecosystem and of the 30 species in the @entity4 only four are classed as pests			0
the majority of slugs actually live underground and the ones which can be seen feeding on the surface make up less than 5 per cent of the population			0
the gastropods can move up to 16 feet per night and can detect food from 23 inches away			0
@entity5 slugs vary in colour from bright orange to rusty brown and can be identified by their high numbers and odd diet which also includes excrement .			1

@entity5 slugs can grow up to 6in and produce 400 eggs each
their diet includes dead animals , excrement and each other
invasion only slowed thanks to cold weather in may
