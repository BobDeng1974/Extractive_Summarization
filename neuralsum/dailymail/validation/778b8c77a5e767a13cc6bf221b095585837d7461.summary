@entity0 is confident he can score more test hundreds for @entity2 , if he is given the opportunity			1
the controversial , record - breaking batsman trails only captain @entity4 in the all - time list of @entity2 's most prolific test centurions - having made 23 , before he was sacked 13 months ago			1
the 34 - year - old is hoping to resurrect his career with his adopted country after new @entity12 chairman @entity11 hinted that a return to county cricket - and first - class form - may put him back in the reckoning after all			1
@entity0 believes he is capable of adding to his 23 test centuries if he receives an @entity2 recall @entity2 captain @entity4 ( right ) has scored two more centuries than @entity0 ( centre ) @entity4 - 25 @entity0 - 23 @entity22 - 22 @entity23 - 22 @entity24 - 22 @entity0 is therefore pursuing the possibility of securing a new contract in this country			1
@entity28 , who de-registered him six months ago after a summer in which he played only @entity31 cricket , appear to be strong favourites to re-sign him - as long as he can secure a release from his arrangement to play in the @entity35 , which clashes with the start of the @entity38 domestic season			2
@entity0 was axed after @entity2 's 2013 - 14 ashes whitewash defeat , and @entity12 managing director @entity41 subsequently described his ' disengagement ' with his team - mates			1
he struggled for form , and fitness , in the summer that followed but rediscovered both for @entity48 in the @entity49 this winter			0
on his return to @entity52 , to commentate on the knockout stages of the @entity54 , he made it clear in an interview on @entity57 on tuesday that he believes he can excel again for @entity2			1
' i do n't think my best days are behind me			0
' i thought i batted as well as i 've ever batted in my career in @entity52 a few months ago			0
' i think that 's nonsense - i reckon i 've still got quite a few test hundreds in me			0
' former @entity2 cricketer @entity0 has rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him @entity2 appeared to have severed all ties with the @entity65 - born batsman , until @entity11 recently indicated otherwise			1
@entity0 's autobiography , in which he depicted a culture of bullying in the @entity2 dressing - room and was highly critical of former team - mates and management staff , seemed to merely confirm a permanent split			1
former @entity2 batting coach @entity73 , for one , is still warning against his return			2
' i would n't bring @entity0 back , ' he told the @entity75			2
' i would question whether he would have made that much of a difference in the @entity54			0
' his record for @entity2 over his career has been box office			2
but his performances in odi cricket before this tournament were n't special			0
former @entity2 batting coach @entity73 insists @entity0 does not deserve an international recall ' @entity0 did some great things for @entity2 , make no mistake			1
but now it 's time to move on			0
' @entity73 , on staff during @entity2 's ashes defeat down under , takes particular issue with some of the content of @entity0 's autobiography - published last october			1
' i vehemently disagree with all the things @entity0 said			2
' that 's not the dressing - room i remember			0
' in november 2013 , he was given a memento by the players for his 100th test in the dressing - room before the first test at @entity101			0
' then he stated ' this is the best @entity2 environment i have ever played in '			2
' those words came out of his mouth			0
he 's changed his tune just a bit			0

@entity0 believes he still has a *lot* more to give to @entity2
@entity0 is hoping to resurrect his @entity2 career after *losing* place
the 34 - year - old has scored second highest amount of centuries
