@entity0 was accused yesterday of ‘ playing it safe ’ and urged to take ‘ creative risks ’ with its prime time schedule , which is dominated by long - running programmes			1
in a report into the channel ’s output , the @entity5 said peak viewing had been taken over by soaps and factual series – many of which were more than 10 years old – rather than new content			1
following publication of the review yesterday , the @entity0 was urged to create more original content , which was one of its ‘ core principles ’			1
dominated : @entity21 , which launched in 2007 , takes up almost a fifth of prime viewing hours long - running : @entity24 , which began with two episodes a week in 1985 and now airs on four nights , takes up 14 per cent assessing the performance of all @entity0 channels , the trust ’s report singled out prime time @entity0 , noting that almost two thirds of its 7pm to 9pm slot is dominated by the same 10 programmes			1
all but one of the programmes are at least five years old			0
@entity21 , which launched in 2007 , takes up almost a fifth of prime viewing hours , while @entity24 , which began with two episodes a week in 1985 and now airs on four nights , takes up 14 per cent			0
@entity37 , which has been running for 35 years , and @entity38 , which began in 1953 , were also among the ten most - broadcast programmes for the time slot			1
the others were @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , which will end next year			1
about 5,000 people were surveyed for the review , which found that the average age for @entity0 viewers is 59 , up from 56 in 2010 - 2011			1
@entity52 has seen a similar rise , with an average age of 60 – up by two years			0
both channels are losing viewers in the 16 - 34 age range			0
@entity0 trustee @entity58 said the trust did not want to replace the dominant programmes in prime time , but to make additions			2
he added that @entity0 ‘ should n’t be a succession of high - risk shows just for the sake of it ’ but admitted that the dominance of the ten shows meant that a ‘ significant number of potential viewers ’ were not being served by the channel			1
‘ @entity0 television is fulfilling its commitment to deliver a wide range of enjoyable and entertaining programmes and in the past few years there has been an increase in the perceptions of originality across all channels , ’ he said			2
‘ however , the trust believes that @entity0 should take more creative risks while serving wider audiences and has asked the executive to set out how it will increase the distinctiveness of schedules			2
’ the report by the trust states there are ‘ wide audience perceptions of the channel being too reliant on familiar titles ’ and tending to ‘ play it safe ’ with programming and scheduling			2
same old shows : @entity46 ( left ) and @entity44 ( right ) also dominate the 7pm to 9pm slot a much higher number of new programmes are broadcast after 9pm but mr @entity58 said there was still a need for ‘ greater innovation in factual programming ’ and ‘ a refreshment of entertainment ’ in the nighttime slot			1
he added that the @entity0 needed to do more to appeal to younger viewers and minority ethnic groups			2
conservative mp @entity109 , who serves on the @entity110 , said he was not surprised by the trust ’s findings and added to calls for more original content			1
‘ to some extent i would like the @entity0 to concentrate more on that , ’ he said			2
‘ if it means fewer channels with more original content then that might well be a way forward			1
providing new and original content is one of the core principles of the @entity0			1
‘ there is plenty of programming from the past that people do want to see , but there are so many ways you can access that through commercial channels and through archives			0
i think people look to the @entity0 for new , original drama and comedy			2
’ mr @entity58 said the biggest challenge for the @entity0 was ‘ to keep as many people watching as possible ’ and that there should be ‘ something for everybody ’			2
he also hinted there may be a rise in entertainment programmes such as @entity43 @entity43			0
dismay : four @entity38 reporters have lost their jobs there were fears for the future of @entity38 last night after its four reporters , who together have more than half a century of experience making the programme , lost their jobs			0
there were said to have been scenes of ‘ dismay ’ as they were told by new editor @entity158 that their jobs no longer exist			0
@entity38 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 have won several awards but will now have to find alternative roles within the @entity0 or leave the corporation altogether			1
the programme will instead be staffed by news reporters and presenters such as @entity169			0
an insider claimed the panorama team were assured that their jobs were safe			0
‘ there was a cold , icy silence when the news was announced , ’ said the insider			0
‘ we had been told for weeks and weeks that our jobs would be safe and then last night [ wednesday ] we got an email saying to come in in the morning and that ’s when they told us			0
‘ @entity158 is the new editor and they have almost certainly brought him in just to do this			0
we ’ve all got years of experience whereas he has been in the job less than a month			0
‘ how can he tell us that the way forward is to get rid of all the people who ’ve made the most panoramas ? how can he justify that ? ’ @entity38 is the world ’s longest - running current affairs television programme , having first been shown in 1953			1
the cuts are part of a restructuring that will result in the @entity0 ’s news operation shedding more than 200 jobs , including around 80 in the newsroom .			0
