by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 13:55 est , 8 march 2013 @entity2 scientists believe they may have discovered new life forms sealed off for 14 million years in a subglacial lake deep under the @entity6 ice			1
scientists say the icy darkness of @entity10 , under 3,700 metres of ice , may provide a glimpse of the planet before the @entity13 and clues to life on other planets			1
' after excluding all known contaminants , bacterial dna was found that does not match any known species in world databases , ' @entity17 of the @entity18 told a @entity2 news agency			1
drilling into history : @entity2 researchers have reached @entity10 , and believe they may have found evidence of previously unseen bacterial life in water samples - although they need further research to confirm the head of the drilling rig used by the research team to drill to the @entity10 underground lake ' if it ( the bacteria ) had been found on @entity39 , then without a doubt we would have said there is life on @entity39 - but this is dna from @entity43 , ' he said			1
' we are calling this life form unidentified or unclassified			0
' the @entity2 discovery came from analysing water that froze onto the end of the drill bit used to bore through to @entity10 - the largest of a network of hundreds of lakes under the ice cap that acts like a blanket trapping the @entity43 's geothermal heat			1
@entity17 told @entity55 that scientists are waiting for more samples from the lake to confirm their discovery			2
because of the technology used to keep from polluting the pristine lake , @entity2 will only obtain clean water samples - uncontaminated by drilling fluid - for analysis later this year			1
to answer concerns kerosene and anti-freeze from the borehole would seep into the lake , @entity2 engineers withdrew the drill to allow the water to percolate up into the borehole and freeze there , only returning this year to collect it			2
but @entity17 said the unknown microbes were found after separating out species of bacteria that are known to exist in the drilling fluid			2
' when we tried to identify the dna , it did not coincide with any known species			0
it 's degree of similarity was less than 86 percent , ' @entity17 told @entity55			0
' that is practically zero when working with dna			0
a level of 90 percent tells us the organism is unknown			2
' frozen samples from deeper in the borehole collected during this year 's @entity6 summer season in february are now being carried back by boat and are due in @entity91 in may			0
' if we again identify the same group of organism in that pure sample of water , then we can confidently say we have found new life on @entity43 , ' @entity17 said			0
scientists from the @entity98 and @entity99 are close on @entity101 's heels to probe what life may exist in one of the most extreme environments on @entity43			2
@entity2 scientists have drilled into the prehistoric sub-glacier @entity10 , which has been trapped under @entity6 ice for 14 million years and say they may have found a new form of life an aerial view of the @entity10 research camp in @entity6 where @entity2 have drilled into the prehistoric sub-glacier @entity10 @entity113 was set up by the @entity2 in 1956 , and their seismic soundings soon suggested there was an area of liquid underneath			1
however , @entity2 specialists , supported by their @entity99 counterparts , finally discovered @entity10 in 1996			1
sonar and satellite images later proved the lake to be one of the world ’s largest freshwater reservoirs			0
with its area reaching 15,000 sq. km and a depth exceeding 1,200 meters , @entity10 is one of the biggest among 370 sub-glacial lakes in @entity6			1
this year , a @entity98 expedition said they had seen living cells under a microscope in field samples taken from the shallower subglacial @entity135 , but more study is needed to determine what kinds of bacteria they are and how they live			0
a @entity99 effort to reach a third body , @entity142 , was called off in december because of problems drilling			0
what life is found in the icy depths may provide the best answer yet to whether life can exist in the extreme conditions on @entity39 or @entity150 's @entity149			0
in february @entity2 researchers became the first in the world to reach the waters of @entity10 after more than decades of drilling work			1
they managed to reach the fresh ice at a depth of 3383 meters and took samples at 3,406 meters			0
ice formed as the water from the lake rose into the hole due to upward - pressure in the crack researchers drilled last february			0
last year @entity2 scientists managed to drill through 3700 meters of ice , reach the surface of the lake and take 40 liters of prehistoric water			1
a general view of the research camp in @entity6 , where researchers have spent years drilling into the ice @entity2 specialists , supported by their @entity99 counterparts , discovered @entity10 back in 1996			1
sonar and satellite images later proved the lake to be one of the world ’s largest freshwater reservoirs			0
with its area reaching 15,000 sq km and a depth exceeding 1,200 metres , @entity10 is one of the biggest among 370 sub-glacial lakes in @entity6			1
in 1998 scientists had to halt the drilling just 130 metres from the lake ’s surface after alarming concerns the ancient and unblemished waters risked being polluted if special precautions were not taken			2
the relevant technology was developed only in 2003 in @entity91 , and work resumed in 2005 after further tests .			0
