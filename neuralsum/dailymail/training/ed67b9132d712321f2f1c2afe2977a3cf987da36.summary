moves that could decriminalise non-payment of the @entity4 licence fee will begin within days , the @entity0 will announce today			1
a review of the £ 145.50 - a - year levy is being brought forward by several months to ensure it is completed before the @entity7 is renewed in 2016			1
if agreed , it would mean non-payment of the licence fee – which accounts for more than one in ten cases brought before magistrates – would no longer be a criminal offence			1
in a high - profile speech , @entity14 will announce the initial work into a review of tv licensing will be published ‘ very shortly ’ , and question whether the current system ‘ is really working ’			1
file picture @entity25 mp @entity24 , who has pushed for laws to decriminalise licence fee evasion and replace it with civil penalties , said : ‘ this shows the government is taking it very seriously ’			1
ministers had committed to launching a review and were planning for it to begin early in 2015 , when a law to allow the changes receives @entity37			2
but mr @entity14 , who was appointed @entity0 this year , will tell the @entity39 conference of industry executives he no longer believes it can wait until the @entity42 becomes law			2
doubts : culture secretary @entity14 has questioned whether the current system ‘ is really working ’ ‘ this needs to begin now , ’ he will say			0
‘ very shortly i will be publishing the terms of reference for a review of tv licence enforcement			2
i expect it to begin taking evidence in the autumn , and to conclude early in the next @entity54			0
’ he will add that calling for evidence straight away , ahead of the @entity57 ‘ will allow it to shape the future of the @entity4 in a way that works for both the @entity61 and those who pay for it ’			0
the move is likely to be popular with the public , although the @entity4 fears it could cost them up to £ 200million a year			2
the results of the review will not be published until after the general election			0
mr @entity24 proposed the amendment to the @entity42 in march this year , and forced it to a vote – managing to win the backing of @entity72 from all three main parties			0
he said the existing laws penalised those on low incomes and called it a ‘ shameful blot on our justice system ’			0
the proposal has also won the backing of @entity83 director @entity82 and former @entity4 chairman @entity84			0
in 2012 , 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their tv licence , accounting for one in nine of all cases in the magistrates ’ courts			0
most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £ 1,000 and a criminal record , and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines			2
mr @entity14 has already opened the door to slashing the licence fee itself , saying earlier this year that it represents a ‘ large amount ’ of money for many families			1
in his first major interview he said ‘ nothing should be ruled out ’ when the levy , which raises £ 3.6billion a year for the @entity4 , is renewed for another decade in 2016			1
a @entity25 source said last night : ‘ @entity14 was sympathetic to @entity24 ’s amendment earlier this year , before he became @entity0			1
he is persuaded the review should start sooner rather than later			0
