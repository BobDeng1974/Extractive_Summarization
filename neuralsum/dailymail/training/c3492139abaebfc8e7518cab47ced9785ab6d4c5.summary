by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 04:21 est , 7 january 2014 @entity2 suffers from aura migraine , which causes her vision to partially disappear for about 20 minutes @entity5 has suffered from migraines for almost 30 years but rarely has a headache			1
instead , a bright , flashing line appears across her eyes , causing her vision to partly disappear			1
the 42 - year - old has suffered up to five such attacks a day , severely affecting her work and ability to drive			1
what she experiences is known as a silent migraine - a type of migraine that comes without the severe headache typically associated with the condition			1
instead , those affected experience visual disturbance , co-ordination problems , and pins and needles ( symptoms known as migraine ' aura ' )			2
' the first time it happened i was about 14 and thought i was having a stroke or going blind - it was terrifying , ' says @entity2 , a @entity32 administrator who lives with her husband @entity33 , 44 , a heritage building restorer , in @entity35 , @entity36			1
she saw an optician , who reassured her there was nothing wrong with her eyes , but after doing her own research she realised what was causing her symptoms			1
she put up with the silent migraines and realised she would feel ok again after they passed , usually after about 20 minutes - although during that time she could n't see properly and her co-ordination was compromised			1
on average , she had about five attacks a year but two years ago she started having the attacks four or five times a day so she sought medical help			2
in the aftermath , she felt ' spaced out ' and tired for a few hours			2
migraine aura can have a wide range of different symptoms , including seeing flashing lights , zigzag lines and blind spots , stiffness or a tingling sensation in the neck , shoulders and limbs , problems with co-ordination , difficulty speaking , and occasionally loss of consciousness			1
@entity67 often strikes just before a crippling headache , which usually sets in under an hour after the aura finishes			1
some people never have a headache , and just experience aura , while others will initially experience just aura symptoms , but then go on to experience severe headaches			1
some people 's migraines change as they age , so the headache can fade , while the aura remains			1
around a third of the eight million people in the @entity84 who suffer from migraines experience the symptoms of aura , with an estimated 1 per cent - around 80,000 - having silent migraines , according to the @entity89			1
however , the real number may be much higher , suggests dr @entity91 , a consultant neurologist at @entity92 , @entity93			2
he believes silent migraine cases are significantly under - reported , as many people will experience them infrequently and not seek help			1
the estimated number of migraine attacks that occur every day in the @entity84 but he warns it is important to rule out other causes if the symptoms suddenly start , particularly in the over- 60s , as such symptoms are also linked with stroke and a detached retina ( when the light - sensitive area at the back of the eye detaches from blood vessels , potentially causing blindness )			1
' it can even be difficult for a healthcare professional to tell the difference between the symptoms of a stroke and a prolonged attack of aura , ' he says			0
indeed , people experiencing silent migraine for the first time often dash to @entity122 or their gp practice , frightened they are having a stroke - that 's because they do n't also have the headache symptom that might suggest it 's a migraine , says dr @entity126 , director of headache services at @entity128 , @entity93			1
' @entity67 can be worrying , ' he adds			0
the key point is that migraine aura symptoms develop relatively slowly , and then spread and intensify , while stroke symptoms are sudden , according to the @entity132			0
migraines also involve acquiring symptoms , such as seeing flashing lights - stroke is characterised by losing abilities , such as muscle strength or speech			1
it 's important to get the correct diagnosis of migraine with aura as it 's linked to a higher risk of stroke and heart problems			0
auras can happen without any of the traditional pain associated with migraine , but are distressing a 15 - year study into the health of 28,000 female health professionals at the @entity152 and @entity153 in the @entity154 found migraines with aura were the second highest risk factor for heart attack and stroke , after high blood pressure			1
a review of 25 studies published in the @entity163 in 2009 found risk of stroke for people with migraine with aura was twice as high as the rest of the population , while there was no extra risk for those with migraine without aura			0
for women with aura the risk of stroke was double that of men with aura			0
and a @entity183 study found that women who suffered migraine with aura who took the contraceptive pill had a 16 times greater risk of stroke ; if they smoked as well it led to a 34 times higher risk			0
for this reason , women with aura should not be on the combined @entity193 and should stop smoking , says dr @entity195 , a consultant neurologist at @entity196			0
' stroke risk is higher for those with aura , but it is still small , until you factor in smoking and taking the combined @entity193			0
it is important doctors are aware of these risks to give correct advice			0
' meanwhile , the @entity206 says that people with aura should reduce their risk of heart trouble by keeping physically active , eating a healthy diet and not smoking - and advises anyone concerned by the risks to consult their gp for more advice			1
when @entity2 was formally diagnosed two years ago , her gp prescribed propranolol , a beta blocker used for angina and high blood pressure , also found to be effective in reducing migraine ( it 's thought the medication , which reduces blood flow and opens blood vessels , helps by reducing electrical activity in the brain during migraine )			0
after taking it for three months , her migraines subsided , and have since gone back to the usual rate of about five a year			2
@entity232 , from the @entity89 , says : ' no one is really sure why migraines can change			2
they tend to be worse in younger people , and may ease off in the 50s and 60s - 40 per cent of sufferers no longer have migraines by age 65			1
' attacks of migraine aura can cause a lack of confidence in leaving the home , because not being able to see properly can cause vulnerability			0
if a person drives for their job such attacks could mean a change of career			0
' if it interferes with driving safety , aura may need to be reported to the @entity254			0
triggers include foods such cheese or chocolate , alcohol , exercise , lack of sleep and stress migraine sufferers can usually identify triggers , and keeping a diary to record when attacks happen can be helpful			0
triggers include foods such cheese or chocolate , alcohol , exercise , lack of sleep , and stress - avoiding them can reduce attacks			2
when attacks occur once a week or more , preventative medication , including beta blockers , antidepressants and epilepsy medication , can be prescribed			0
however , particularly with epilepsy medication , there can be unpleasant side - effects such as nausea , tiredness and depression			2
some patients take supplements such as magnesium			0
studies have suggested migraine patients may have low levels of the nutrient and two trials , one in @entity296 the other in @entity298 , have shown magnesium supplements helped reduce the number of migraines people suffered , although other trials have had mixed results			2
meanwhile , the nutrient co-enzyme @entity306 reduced the number of migraines people experienced by 50 per cent , in a study at the @entity310 , @entity311 , while patients taking vitamin @entity313 ( riboflavin ) for a @entity316 study also reported a 59 per cent drop in migraine activity			2
the @entity89 says many studies suggest mild regular aerobic exercise can help reduce attacks			0
as stress is a common trigger , deep breathing exercises , yoga , acupuncture and physiotherapy are also recommended			0
while @entity2 's silent migraines have stopped taking over her life , she says they are of ten misunderstood			1
' while i have always had good care from doctors , for a lot of people it is hard to understand aura and its impact , ' she says			0
' for most people , a migraine involves a throbbing headache that lasts days			2
for me , the aura is always the worst symptom and while it is happening there is nothing that you can do but wait it out			0
