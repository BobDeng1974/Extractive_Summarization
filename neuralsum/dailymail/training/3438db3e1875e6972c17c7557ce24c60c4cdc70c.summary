by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 06:39 est , 8 november 2012 a lesbian intent on stopping her former lover seeing the children they had together with donated sperm has been warned by the @entity8 's top family judge to stop poisoning them against their other mother			2
the former couple have spent 10 years and more than £ 200,000 battling eachother in one of @entity8 's most bitter custody battles , @entity13 's @entity12 heard			1
their children , 11 and 13 , have no memory of their mothers not being at eachother 's throats in an entrenched dispute that has been to the @entity24 three times and the @entity26 once			1
referring to the ' lamentable history ' of the case yesterday , top family judge , @entity27 , said that every attempt by the courts and social workers to make the former lovers see sense and agree reasonable child contact arrangements had been doomed to failure			0
row : the legal battle between the two mothers , which has cost more than £ 200,000 and lasted a decade is still going ( file picture ) the birth mother , who lives in @entity42 and was referred to in court as @entity44 , has spent all she has trying to keep her former partner – known as @entity46 – away from their two girls , who were conceived using artificial insemination			1
distraught about not being able to see her daughters , estranged @entity46 headed to court again earlier this year to ask judges to force these girls to move to her home in @entity55			0
twist : lord justice @entity27 yesterday warned the birth mother not to poison her children against their other mother but judge @entity59 ruled this out saying her children no longer thought seeing her was ' valid or worthwhile ' and said it was more important that they lived the way they wanted , in @entity42			2
however , in a new twist , the @entity24 overturned that decision yesterday as @entity27 said that the girls ' view had been tainted by their birth mother , stating there is warmth between the estranged mum and her girls , adding : ' there is a clear mismatch between what these children say and how they behave			1
' he went on the children are ' no doubt well aware of their mother ’s antipathy towards @entity46 and their wishes , although important , should not be taken too literally			0
' she has always been a warm and loving parent who has never failed these children			0
' social workers said there is ' natural warmth ' between @entity46 and the girls and @entity27 said : ' a subtle but familiar strategy is for the primary carer to declare that it is for the children to decide , and they go whenever they please , whilst at the same time projecting a clear message that she does not wish or expect them to go			0
' it is also my view that the judge ( @entity59 ) did not sufficiently factor in the crucial importance of the relationship between the children and @entity46 and her family and the damage that would be caused to them by its loss			0
' relentless : the case has now been going since 2002 and has been to the @entity109 ( pictured ) , @entity12 and @entity26 as the lesbians battle for custody laying down a warning to @entity44 of where her stubborness may take her , the judge added : ' if she can not sustain the relationship between the children and @entity46 then consideration would have to be given to moving them to @entity46 ’s home '			1
but rather than settling the matter , it is hurtling headlong back to court , drawing comparison 's to the the never - ending @entity124 vs @entity124 case at the heart of @entity128 ' @entity127 , as now @entity46 's application for a residence order over the two girls will now go back for re-hearing by a high court judge .			2

their children , 11 and 13 , have no memory of their mothers not being at *loggerheads* , @entity13 's @entity12 heard
the birth mother has spent all her savings trying to keep her former partner away from their two girls , conceived using artificial insemination
dispute has been to the @entity24 three times and the @entity26 once - and will now go to the @entity109 again
