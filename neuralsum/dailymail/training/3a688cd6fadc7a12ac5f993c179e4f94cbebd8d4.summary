@entity0 has no intention of giving up			1
he wo n’t abandon all hope			0
playing for @entity3 at the @entity4 remains the objective , despite recent disappointment			1
the @entity8 fly - half has responded to being omitted from the national squad for the autumn test campaign in fine style			1
rather than allowing the setback to undermine his form , he has instead played an instrumental role in three successive @entity17 wins which have lifted his club to sixth place in the table			0
@entity22 fly - half @entity0 is determined to go to next year 's @entity4 @entity0 ( centre ) was dropped from @entity3 's squad for the @entity25 on sunday , it was @entity0 ’s moment of individual brilliance which created a stunning counter-attack try for the @entity22 against @entity30 at @entity31			1
it was another glimpse of his game - breaking class			0
after making an impressive contribution on @entity3 ’s summer tour of @entity37 , the 27 - year - old was left out of the latest squad			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ all i can do is control how i train every day , keep trying to improve and keep working on my point of difference			1
’ as he prepared for @entity8 ’s @entity43 clash with @entity44 at the @entity45 on saturday , he added : ‘ even if i do n’t get selected , it is a long way to go until the @entity4 and i ’ll keep driving and keep knocking on the door			1
‘ i ’m going to keep pushing every time i play ; with passion and drive and resilience and the will to win			0
eventually , i want to play for my country again			0
‘ things do happen , things can change and you can play your way into the squad			0
the @entity3 coaches are very good at communicating ; they speak to you , tell you what they want and what you have to improve on			2
it makes you feel like you ’re part of the wider squad			0
’ @entity0 has been in inspirational for his club - taking sale on a three game winning run the 27 - year - old impressed for @entity3 during the summer tour of @entity37 that match - winning turn at @entity30 was just the latest example of his enhanced contribution at club level			1
‘ i feel like i ’m playing better this year , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m going to keep putting my hand up			0
’ sale director of rugby @entity79 has regularly championed his playmaker ’s test claims and yesterday said : ‘ @entity0 ’s playing really well , he ’s controlling the basics and he ’s showing on occasion the bit of glitter that he has			2
‘ there was a great example at @entity30 where two teams were in stalemate with a couple of points in it and his act of brilliance won us the game			0
‘ it would be foolhardy to think that , if @entity0 had been selected , @entity3 would have beaten @entity94 and @entity37 , but i think it would have been wise as a selector to look at him in one of the four games			1
‘ @entity0 was outstanding before the squad was announced , against @entity100 , and did n’t get a look - in			1
’ the @entity102 10 is preparing to take on @entity44 in the @entity43 clash on saturday @entity44 star @entity104 stands ahead of @entity0 in the @entity3 pecking order on saturday , @entity0 is likely to be in direct opposition to @entity104 , who has been @entity3 ’s first - choice no 10 under @entity107 , only to be demoted last month after a run of poor form			1
‘ you want to play against the best 10s , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ in @entity3 , you come up against @entity104 , @entity112 , @entity113 week in , week out			2
if you get a chance in a @entity116 fixture it does add spice to it and you want to have a great game			0
it ’s important that we rise to the occasion as a team			0
’ diamond is convinced that if his forwards can front up against an imposing @entity44 pack , @entity0 has the ability to trump his opposite number — whether that is @entity104 or @entity131 @entity130			1
‘ if we can get parity then i think @entity0 can surpass the pair of them , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity130 can do with his hands what @entity0 can do			2
he is a great distributor and that would be a great contest			0

@entity0 was left out of @entity3 's @entity146 squad
the @entity22 fly - half has *n't* given up hope of going to the @entity4
