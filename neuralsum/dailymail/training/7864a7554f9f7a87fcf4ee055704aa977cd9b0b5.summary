@entity1 coach @entity0 will be counting on @entity2 and @entity3 to help his country qualify for @entity5 despite their absence for upcoming games			1
both players have excelled since joining @entity10 this summer but neither is fully fit and unable to help in saturday 's qualifier against @entity12 and the friendly at home to @entity15 three days later			1
unlike @entity2 , @entity3 , who has scored two goals and set up another 11 in 15 appearances for @entity10 , was included in @entity0 's squad			1
@entity3 has been ruled out of @entity1 's games against @entity12 and @entity15 over the next week the @entity10 midfielder was spotted at a party at @entity22 in @entity23 on tuesday fabregas , who has been superb this season , has a hamstring problem but should n't be missing for too long however , the 27 - year - old midfielder was ruled out with a hamstring problem after undergoing a check - up in @entity30 earlier this week			1
' we had to wait a few days to evaluate @entity3 's injury and we opted for him not to continue with us , ' @entity0 said to @entity34 radio station @entity35			1
' at times we have been flexible but not in this case			0
' his muscle seems all right but he complains and he is the best doctor			0
' i prefer to be deceived but i can not be distrustful			0
' when a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured , you have to believe him			0
' @entity2 was left out of @entity0 's latest selection in order to rest			1
the @entity46 - born striker missed four matches for @entity10 through injury after scoring his first goal for @entity1 in last month 's 4 - 0 triumph over @entity51			1
' in our previous training camp , he ( @entity2 ) complained about pain in his pelvic bone , ' @entity0 said			1
' i thought it was best for him to take a break			0
' it 's not a sign of weakness , i do n't want to confront anyone			0
@entity2 is also ruled out , but the @entity10 striker had n't been selected in the 23 - man squad manager @entity0 said @entity1 were n't willing to push @entity2 to the limit in playing him again ' when i gave my 23 - man squad , i knew that he ( @entity2 ) was going to play with his club at the weekend			1
' but we can not push someone when they do n't feel completely well			0
' he is the first one that has asked us to please not forget him when i make my next squad selection in february			2
' @entity2 , who has scored 10 goals in nine @entity74 appearances for @entity10 so far , is eager to shine for @entity1			1
the former @entity30 star became a naturalised player earlier this year and has found the back of the net just once in seven appearances for @entity1 since			1
however , @entity0 is confident @entity2 will have a starring role for the national team despite his slow start			2
' for whatever reason , he ( @entity2 ) has not been 100 per cent with us , ' he said			2
' however , we can not say that he has not given all of his enthusiasm , he has always had a desire to play			0
' we have n't been lucky , he has been a slave of our lack of play			0
' had we not opted to select him ( naturalise him ) , now we would have thrown our hands in the air			0
' seeing how @entity2 moves , the spaces he finds , this can not be bad for any team			2
' perhaps he is not as technical but not all forwards need to be in order to score goals			0
' defending @entity100 champions @entity1 head into friday 's home match against @entity12 in second place in @entity103 with six points from three games			2
they are three points adrift of leaders @entity108 .			0
