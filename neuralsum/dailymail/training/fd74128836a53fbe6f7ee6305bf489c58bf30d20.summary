by @entity0 published : 01:24 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 5 february 2013 this is the dramatic moment that the lights went out in the middle of the @entity4 on sunday night , leaving officials looking out over 71,000 football fans with baffled expressions			1
a tv network had been holding an interview behind - the scenes at the @entity12 control room in @entity13 when a power cut rippled around the stadium			1
an eerie calm descended in the tower as the 35 - minute power cut set in			2
officials maintained a grip on their emotions despite the fact there appeared to be little clue as to what was going on			0
the pair were discussing how the superstar 's performance had over-run by three minutes and were wrapping up the interview when floodlights around the top of the @entity12 cut out , plunging thousands of fans and players on the field into darkness			2
at first , @entity54 calmly announced ' alright , we lost lights ' before another official says ' we 're going to a manual override '			0
the mood became tense as officials struggled to get an idea of what had happened			0
@entity63 , a senior official for @entity64 who own the @entity12 , then told @entity54 : ' @entity38 , we lost the a feed			0
' @entity38 replied : ' what does that mean ? ' @entity63 added : ' that means that we have to do the bus time ? ' before @entity38 again asked : ' what does that mean ? ' only then does @entity63 explain there will be a likely 20 - minute delay			2
stress : one official clutches his head as the team in the control room scrambled to work out why the power had cut uh-oh : questions remain as to why the lights blew at the @entity4 2013 with officials simply saying it was down to an ' abnormality ' in the power system questions remain over exactly what caused the stadium to plunge into darkness in the third quarter of the game , with officials simply saying that it was due to an ' abnormality ' in the power system			1
@entity31 was let off the hook on monday after she was earlier made scapegoat when she allegedly blew the electrics twice during rehearsals for her spectacular half - time performance			1
the problem occurred shortly after the superstar 's show , leaving many wondering whether extravagant lighting and video effects were to blame , while others questioned whether @entity13 ' infrastructure was still suffering in the aftermath of @entity111			2
public records released on monday show that @entity12 officials were worried about a power outage several months before the big game			1
an october 15 memo released by the @entity117 , which oversees the @entity12 , says tests on the dome 's electrical feeders showed they had ' some decay and a chance of failure '			0
blowout performance ? @entity31 's dazzling performance was earlier suggested to be the cause of the power cut but was later found not to blame @entity129 @entity13 , the company that supplies the stadium with power , and the structure 's engineering staff ' had concerns regarding the reliability of the @entity138 service from @entity129 's connection point to the @entity138 , ' the memo says			1
those concerns were due in part to ' circumstances that have previously occurred with the electrical service regarding transient spikes and loads '			0
the memo also cites 2011 blackouts that struck @entity146 , where the @entity42 were playing a nationally televised on monday night football game , as a reason for ordering the tests			1
the board later authorized spending nearly $ 1 million on @entity12 improvements , including more than $ 600,000 for upgrading the dome 's electrical feeder cable system			2
' as discussed in previous board meetings , this enhancement is necessary to maintain both the @entity12 and the @entity156 as top tier facilities , and to ensure that we do not experience any electrical issues during the @entity4 , ' says a @entity117 document dated december 19			0
darkness descends : only some floodlights remained in use during a blackout for 35minutes at the @entity12 in @entity13 on sunday night in the balance : a @entity43 cheerleader performs for the crowd in the near - pitch darkness at the @entity4 an attorney for the state board that oversees the @entity12 said the blackout did not appear to be related to the replacement in december of electrical equipment connecting the stadium to @entity129			1
officials with the utility and the @entity12 noted that an @entity179 game , the @entity180 and another bowl game were played there in recent weeks with no apparent problems			2
the exact cause of sunday night 's blackout - and who 's to blame - remained unclear late on monday , though a couple of potential culprits had been ruled out			2
it was n't @entity31 's electrifying halftime performance , according to @entity63 , manager of the state - owned @entity12 , since the singer had her own generator			1
and it apparently was n't a case of too much demand for power			0
meters showed the 76,000 - seat stadium was drawing no more electricity than it does during a typical @entity200 game , @entity63 said			2
brought to a halt : @entity43 players look around the @entity12 after the lights went out during the second half of @entity206 f tensions : @entity42 49ers offensive lineman @entity208 , right , sits on the sidelines during the 35 - minute power outage the lights - out game on sunday proved an embarrassment for @entity13 just when it was hoping to show the rest of the world how far it has come since @entity111 in 2005			1
but many fans and residents were forgiving , and officials expressed confidence that the episode would n't hurt the city 's hopes of hosting the championship again			2
to @entity13 ' great relief , @entity179 commissioner @entity224 said the city did a ' terrific ' job hosting its first pro-football championship in the @entity230 era , and added : ' i fully expect that we will be back here for @entity4			0
' fans watching from their living rooms were n't deterred , either			0
an estimated 108.4 million television viewers saw the @entity43 beat the @entity237 49ers 34 - 31 , making it the third most - viewed program in television history			2
both the 2010 and 2011 games hit the 111 million mark			0
the problem that caused the outage was believed to have happened around the spot where a line that feeds current from @entity247 connects with the @entity12 's electrical system , officials said			1
but whether the fault lay with the utility or with the @entity12 was not clear			0
determining the cause will probably take days , according to @entity252 , a vice president for distribution and transmission for @entity129			0
he said the makers of some of the switching gear have been brought in to help figure out what happened			0
the blackout came after a nearly flawless week of activity for football fans in @entity13 leading up to the big game			1
faulty : a referee gestures to players as the field was plunged into darkness at the start of the third quarter ' i hope that 's not what they 'll remember about this @entity4 , ' @entity269 artist @entity268 said			0
' i hope that what they 'll remember is they had a great time here and that they were welcomed here			0
' @entity43 fan @entity280 , a @entity43 native who went to the game with his 11 - year - old son , said the outage just extended the experience			1
' the more time we could spend at the game was a good thing , as long as it ended the way it did , ' he said , laughing			0
the city last hosted the @entity4 in 2002 , and officials were hoping this would serve as the ultimate showcase for the city 's recovery since @entity111 in 2005			0
the storm tore holes in the roof of the @entity12 and caused water damage to its electrical systems , and more than $ 330 million was spent repairing and upgrading the stadium			0
sunday 's @entity4 was @entity13 ' 10th as host , and officials plan to make a bid for an 11th in 2018			1
mayor @entity306 told @entity307 on monday that the outage wo n't hurt the city 's chances , and he joked that the game got better after the blackout : ' people were leaving and the game was getting boring , so we had to do a little something to spice it up			1
' the chairwoman of the @entity319 's @entity318 has called an emergency meeting for friday to discuss the power outage			1
@entity322 , a columnist for nola.com and @entity324 , wrote that the power outage gave the media ' an opportunity to laugh at the apparent ineptitude or suggest that the ghosts of @entity111 were haunting the @entity12 '			1
' that 's not the kind of attention the city was looking for , obviously , ' he wrote , ' but it 's certainly too soon to say if people will remember the power shortage over @entity237 's furious comeback attempt against @entity43 or if this will harm the city 's future opportunities to host the @entity4 ' .			1

tv cameras caught the moment when the power went out at @entity13 stadium at beginning of third quarter
suggestions that @entity31 's spectacular half - time performance had *overloaded* the system proved false
play between the @entity42 and @entity43 *suspended* for 35 minutes
