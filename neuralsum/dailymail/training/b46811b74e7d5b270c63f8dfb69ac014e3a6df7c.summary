by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:10 pm on 1st july 2011 police chiefs are set to scrap a plan to replace vultures with sniffer dogs after it turned out to be a miserable failure			1
the @entity8 authorities imported the feathered recruits from @entity10 , @entity11 , after hearing of their incredible eyesight and fantastic sense of smell			2
it was hoped these attributes , coupled with the birds ' ability to find dead prey would help them to find dead bodies			0
vultures are famed for their eyesight and sense of smell - but plans to replace police sniffer dogs with the birds have fallen flat ( file picture ) but the three birds - named @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 - have not only failed to ever find a single cadaver laid out in the wild for them - but one of the vultures has consistently refused to fly at all			1
instead @entity30 walks around at the speed similar to a waddling duck making him far less efficient than the average sniffer dog			1
in addition to this , the other two birds - @entity31 and @entity32 - spend all of their time fighting			1
an insider working with the project at @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity8 , confirmed : ' the project has been a disaster			1
' early trials with the birds - which have a five foot wingspan - had already ruffled feathers with fans of more traditional methods			0
' everyone knows what vultures do when they find a body and they 're not going to be as easy to call off as a @entity61			2
you could find half the evidence disappearing down their beaks , ' said one			0
when contacted this week for a comment , project creator @entity67 said that the vultures were ' not currently available for journalists			2
' trainer @entity8 @entity70 admitted : ' they do n't seem to be able to do anything other than attack each other			0
' and he revealed further research had been done on the birds which indicated they might not have been the best choice			0
he said : ' it seems they are rather cowardly birds - they would rather hide in the woods than be out and about in the open			0

vultures @entity31 and @entity32 fight *constantly* , while @entity30 refuses to fly , *preferring* to walk in circles
police sources slam project ' as a disaster '
