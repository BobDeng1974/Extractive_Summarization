' ' i believe in destiny and faith ' : the 30 - year - old had made an application to the @entity95 three years ago , but then received a call asking her to do an @entity98 shoot			2
she made the decision to take a career in modelling intelligent : miss @entity17 graduated with a law degree at the @entity104 @entity1 will find out today if he is guilty of the manslaughter of girlfriend @entity17 during a @entity106 shooting at his home in @entity108			1

the 27 - year - old athlete broke down as judge @entity112 said there was not enough evidence to support prosecution claims @entity1 intended to kill the law graduate - turned - model last year			1

delivering her verdict yesterday , judge @entity112 criticised @entity1 ' decision to reach for his 9mm pistol and fire it through the toilet cubicle in his home rather than raise the alarm or fire a warning shot			2
she said : ' if the accused , for example , had awoken in the middle of the night and in darkness seen a silhouette by his bed and in a panic shot at that figure , only to find it was the deceased , his conduct would have been understandable and perhaps excusable			0
' she added : ' the accused had reasonable time to think , reflect and conduct himself			0
' i 'm not persuaded that a reasonable person with the same disability would have fired the four shots			0
' the accused knew there was a person behind the toilet door , he chose to use a firearm			0
