with an estimated wealth of about £ 40 million , @entity1 ’s signing will come as a major surprise for many fans , as the show is understood to pay fees of between £ 25,000 and £ 75,000 , depending on how long each star remains in the competition			1
but insiders say the businesswoman , who became a household name as one of the acid - tongued prospective investors on @entity20 , is ‘ hugely excited ’			0
a source said : ‘ there could n’t be anything more dramatically different from @entity1 ’s serious corporate world than the glittery @entity5 ballroom			1
‘ she has spent most of her working life wearing business suits and sitting in meetings – she was really keen to try something totally out of her comfort zone			1
away from the @entity39 she can be very relaxed and quite feminine , so it ’ll be a great opportunity for her to show that side of herself			0
clearly it ’s not about the money for her – she just hopes it will be a great laugh			0
’ line - up : @entity1 will join @entity28 host @entity27 ( left ) and glamorous countdown presenter @entity26 ( right ) on the show other names lining up for this year ’s series include broadcaster @entity50 , model @entity51 , singer @entity53 , and fashion designer @entity54			1

the line - up will be officially unveiled by the @entity28 tomorrow , before the show launches on saturday night			1
it will then return three weeks later and go head - to - head with @entity68 rival the @entity69 in what is set to be another bitter ratings war			0
the two shows have been confirmed to overlap for ten minutes on their opening week , though this crossover may increase as the @entity69 reaches its live stages			0
last year , @entity5 clawed ahead of the singing contest with more than 14 million viewers tuning in for the live final			2
but @entity68 is also launching its own dancing competition on saturday evenings , stepping out , hosted by @entity81 with celebrity contestants and their partners – including @entity85 star @entity84 and interior designer @entity86			0
