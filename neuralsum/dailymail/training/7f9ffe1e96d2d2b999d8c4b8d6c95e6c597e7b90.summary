state school pupils are winning places at the country ’s elite universities with lower a-level grades than their privately educated counterparts , say researchers			1
they are more likely to be admitted to @entity8 universities with @entity10 or c grades than pupils from independent schools			1
and those admitted from the state sector are around 20 per cent less likely to have a * or a grades			2
the findings are likely to reignite the debate over the ‘ social engineering ’ of university places			0
state school pupils are more likely to get into @entity8 universities with @entity22 than those from private schools some private schools are already threatening to boycott universities that are shown to discriminate against their pupils			1
an analysis of a-level grades held by students entering @entity8 universities shows that those from state schools have significantly weaker grades on average			1
fifty - two per cent of the qualifications held by independent school pupils entering 19 of the group ’s 24 universities in 2010 - 11 were either a * or a at a-level			1
this fell to 42 per cent among state entrants , according to data compiled by the student information website @entity45			0
the grades @entity10 and @entity47 made up 24.3 per cent of the marks received by state entrants compared with only 18.2 per cent among independent school students			2
the gap in achievement was most marked in the highly selective universities			0
but it was still apparent at the five @entity8 members that are least popular with private pupils : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
the research comes as universities face increasing pressure to admit more schools from disadvantaged areas and low performing state schools			2
professor @entity68 , director of the @entity69 , has called for universities to set ‘ stretching ’ targets for recruiting students from disadvantaged backgrounds			0
@entity74 , pictured , was one of a number of top institutions not favoured by private school pupils this is in return for the right to charge up to £ 9,000 a year tuition fees			1
he has previously backed the use of differential offers for students from struggling state comprehensives , allowing them to win places with lower grade a-levels than those from high - flying schools			0
while @entity69 does not set universities official targets for state entrants , it does challenge them to do more to promote applications from poor students			2
and guidance on its website says that institutions can mark out poor pupils with potential to succeed by admitting them with lower grades			0
@entity105 , professor of education at @entity106 , told the @entity108 magazine that this pressure might explain why state pupils have been admitted with lower grades			2
‘ universities are very alive to these targets , contrary to what is often reported , ’ she said			0
‘ when universities have good quality state school students , albeit with slightly lower grades , you can see there is a willingness to get them in			1
’ @entity121 , of the @entity122 ’ and @entity123 ’ conference , which represents top independent schools , said it was ‘ unjustifiable ’ to ask for higher grades as a ‘ blanket policy ’			0
he said : ‘ there may always be reasons for an individual student to be given a lower – or higher – offer than that advertised publicly , but a policy which treated students as simply members of a group would be entirely wrong and should be stopped			0

state school pupils more likely to get into top universities with b or cs
students at @entity8 universities also less likely to have a grades
@entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity57 least popular with private pupils
