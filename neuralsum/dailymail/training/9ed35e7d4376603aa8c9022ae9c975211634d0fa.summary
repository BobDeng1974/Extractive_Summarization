the @entity84 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			1
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			2

the test detects early abnormalities which , if left untreated , can develop into cancer of the cervix ( pictured ) the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity256 on @entity257 ( @entity258 ) advised the @entity84 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			2
