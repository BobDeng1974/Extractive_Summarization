a third of @entity2 would refuse to let their elderly parents move in with them if they needed full - time care , a report revealed yesterday			1
but soaring numbers are choosing to take in a lodger – as long as they are willing to pay for it			0
according to the research , just 28 per cent of adults would be happy for ageing parents to come and live with them if they needed 24 - hour support			1
asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home , responses included ‘ sad , guilty , concerned or emotional ’ but the overwhelming majority would not be so welcoming , with a third ( 32 per cent ) saying they ‘ would not let their parents move in ’ and just over a third ( 36 per cent ) admitting they ‘ would have to seriously think about it ’			1
however when asked how they would feel if their parents went into a care home , responses included ‘ sad , guilty , concerned or emotional ’			1
the report , by care home provider @entity25 , touches on one of the biggest social problems facing @entity2 – the future of pensioners at a time when many are living longer than ever before			2
as long as old parents are healthy and do not want to move in with their offspring , then all is well figures from the @entity38 show that the number of centenarians in the @entity25 has increased by more than 70 per cent over the past ten years , taking it to a record 13,350			1
meanwhile , the number of home - owners renting out a room to a lodger has almost doubled over the past five years , according to a separate report from financial services firm @entity48			1
the report said around 715,000 home - owners currently have a lodger , compared to just 369,600 in 2009			2
in a sign of the financial pressure facing many @entity2 , the most common reason was ‘ to help with the bills ’ , followed by boosting their savings and having more disposable income			0
however unlike lodgers – who pay on average £ 3,000 in rent a year – many people ’s elderly parents are ill , in need of care and are short of cash to pay for it			2
dr @entity67 , a leading old age expert , said she was ‘ astonished ’ that such a small proportion of children are prepared to have their elderly parents living with them			0
she said : ‘ family help should surely be give and take – not just one way			0
‘ of course it is possible they feel their homes are not big enough to house their parents			0
there is so much loneliness among older people in this country and part of it seems to stem from more families living further apart			0
in other countries , there does seem to be a greater degree of concern for older family members			0
’ around 2,000 people in the @entity25 – whose parents are older than 60 – took part in the investigation about their willingness for their elderly relatives to live with them if they needed to			1
of those who said they would n’t let their parents move in , half said it was because their home was too small			0
four in ten said they ‘ would not be able to cope ’ , while one in five said they lack the ‘ necessary skills to look after their parents ’			2
common conditions among the elderly in need of care include dementia , parkinson ’s disease , arthritis , heart disease or a general lack of mobility			1
and the problem of care looks set to worsen over the coming decades			0
for example , the @entity113 predicts the number of over- 60s with @entity117 ’s and related conditions could more than double from 800,000 to two million by 2050 , putting huge pressure on both the @entity121 and social services			2
@entity123 , from @entity25 , said : ‘ the thought of moving parents into a care home can come with great concern			1
‘ often the decision is made at crisis point when parents need a level of care which families may not be able to provide			0
