@entity0 last night ordered an inquiry to establish the ‘ full facts ’ of a vicious spat between two of his most senior @entity5			2
simmering tensions between @entity8 and @entity9 over @entity11 extremism exploded into open warfare late on tuesday evening			2
mr @entity8 was given a dressing - down by the prime minister for triggering the row – prompting speculation he could be moved in the upcoming cabinet reshuffle			1
feud : mr @entity8 , left was given a dressing - down by the prime minister for triggering the row with mrs may , right there was particular anger that mr @entity8 started the damaging spat on the eve of the @entity27 , but senior officials also raised concerns about the ferocity of the attacks on the @entity32 by allies of mrs may , which were described as an ‘ extraordinary over-reaction ’ by one source			1
the prime minister now wants to know the exact role played by the warring ministers and their special advisers			2
in particular , the inquiry is likely to focus on why the @entity41 published a letter from mrs may , that was deeply critical of the @entity43 , in the early hours of yesterday			2
the letter fanned the flames of the row by suggesting mr @entity8 ’s department had ignored warnings about the ‘ trojan horse ’ infiltration of @entity51 schools by @entity11 extremists			1
the details of the dispute date back to a meeting of the government ’s extremism task force last november			0
mr @entity8 wanted to broaden the definition of extremism so that more hardline organisations would be covered			1
when mrs may refused , saying the move risked pushing individuals into feeling persecuted and more susceptible to being radicalised , mr @entity8 took his case to the prime minister			1
earlier this week , after becoming frustrated by his failure to change the @entity41 ’s position , mr @entity8 opted to make the dispute public via a toxic briefing to the @entity72 newspaper			1
anger : @entity0 is said to be furious over the row			0
mr @entity8 and mrs may later issued a joint statement on no 10 's instruction over lunch with the paper ’s editor , he is understood to have criticised mrs may and her senior counter- terrorism adviser @entity81 , who is the architect of anti-extremism policy			2
when mrs may ’s aides learned of the briefing , they made a stinging attack on mr @entity8			2
one said of his department : ‘ lord knows what more they have overlooked on the subject of the protection of kids in state schools			0
’ in the early hours of yesterday , the @entity41 made public the letter from mrs may to mr @entity8 , concerning the ongoing investigation into whether @entity98 hardliners had tried to seize control of 21 schools in @entity51			1
she wrote : ‘ is it true that @entity102 was warned about these allegations in 2008 ? ‘ is it true that the @entity105 was warned in 2010 ? if so , why did nobody act ? it is clear to me that we will need to take clear action to improve the quality of staffing and governance if we are to prevent extremism in schools			0
’ as the fight threatened to spiral out of control , mr @entity8 was contacted by @entity117 , the prime minister ’s chief - of - staff , and ordered to end hostilities			1
he was also spoken to by mr @entity0 personally			0
silent : @entity122 , pictured , has conducted his relationship discretely			0
as a civil servant , he is unable to answer criticisms in public mrs may and mr @entity8 issued a joint statement , on the instruction of @entity129 , promising to work together in future			1
sources say there is irritation in @entity134 that mr @entity8 again opted to make an internal dispute public – gifting @entity136 the opportunity to portray the @entity138 as divided			1
it is the second time in weeks that the @entity32 has been forced to put on a show of unity after a public spat with a colleague			2
last month the prime minister stepped in to defuse a spat between mr @entity8 and his @entity147 deputy , @entity146 , over free school meals			1
of the latest dispute , one @entity150 source said : ‘ the prime minister thinks @entity8 is a very talented minister and when the history books are written , he ’ll go down as one of the great education reformers			1
but this was not seen as helpful			0
’ if mr @entity8 is shifted from @entity32 , possibly to become @entity159 chairman , schools minister @entity157 is tipped as his successor			1
however , some senior @entity138 were taken aback at the aggressive nature of the @entity41 ’s response to mr @entity8 ’s criticisms			1
the highly unusual publication of mrs may ’s barbed letter in the early hours of yesterday morning caused particular surprise			0
‘ this is internal @entity150 correspondence and the @entity41 decides to put it out at 2 o’clock in the morning ? i ’m afraid it looks like the sort of rush of blood to the head that @entity9 is normally very good at avoiding , ’ said one minister			2
shadow home secretary @entity175 said : ‘ for two such senior ministers to launch a vitriolic public blame game in this way is appalling and irresponsible when they should be working together to sort out such serious problems			0
‘ too often both @entity8 and @entity9 resort to public blame games rather than taking any responsibility themselves or working together with others			0
‘ this is bad government and @entity0 should sort it out			0
’ there are long - standing differences between mrs may and mr @entity8 over counter-terrorism strategy , and also simmering tensions over the future leadership of the party , with mr @entity8 understood to be opposed to mrs may taking over			1
he favoured first @entity192 then @entity193 as a so - called ‘ @entity195 ’ candidate			0
his blast against mrs may coincided with polls showing she is the clear favourite to replace mr @entity0			0
in the open : @entity200 mentioned the relationship between @entity81 and @entity202 ( pictured ) on the today programme @entity204 political editor @entity200 yesterday highlighted a relationship between two of @entity9 ’s top advisers – shedding more light on the spat between the @entity41 and the @entity105			0
@entity81 , 54 , and @entity202 , 40 , were thrust into the spotlight when mr @entity200 told @entity211 ’s today programme their relationship was a ‘ complicating factor ’ in the battle between mrs may and @entity8			0
mr @entity200 appeared to suggest miss @entity202 was responsible for anonymous quotes in the @entity72 from a ‘ @entity41 source ’ attacking mr @entity8 , who the newspaper said had been ‘ particularly critical of @entity81 ’			1
mr @entity200 told listeners : ‘ the complicating factor is that @entity81 is in a relationship with @entity9 ’s special adviser [ @entity223 ] who was behind many of the quotes that are in the newspapers today			0
‘ so there is a personal element , but let me stress : that ’s not the key to this story			0

tensions have simmered over handling of ' @entity235 ' extremism plot
started with education secretary criticising @entity41 counter-terrorism
@entity41 responded by making public a damaging letter to mr @entity8
prime minister stepped in and ordered his minister to make a show of unity
now he has ordered an inquiry to get to the bottom of the damaging feud
