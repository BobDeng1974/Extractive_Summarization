for once , there was no hyperbole in the estate agents ' blurb			0
' a bit shabby ' and ' no architectural merit ' were among their unvarnished opinions of the bricks and mortar			0
but this run - down house in desperate need of repair has sold for nearly £ 3.5 million to set a record for the millionaires ' resort of @entity16			1
is the dream over ? this run - down house in the millionaire 's resort of @entity16 sold for nearly £ 3.5 million			1
the owners hoped to bulldoze it and build their dream home desirable : confused as to why the price of a shabby house is so high ? this sea view is the reason views : the property boasts incredible views of the sea to the front and picturesque @entity33 ( pictured here ) to the rear the price paid for the shabby home on the sandy peninsular in @entity33 , @entity40 , equates to £ 1,725 per square foot , well above the existing record of £ 1,364			1
it has sold for £ 3.45 million , which is more than a 400 per cent rise on the last time it was sold in 1998 for £ 665,000			1
with four bedrooms , two bathrooms , three reception areas and two balconies , on paper the house looks to have a lot going for it			2
but the unnamed couple who have bought it are n't interested in the actual building , which they plan to demolish , it is the precious plot of land it sits on			0
it enjoys one of the best locations on @entity16 , boasting two - way views of picturesque @entity33 from the front and the sea to the rear			1
needs work : the house cuts a rather sad figure next to its more glamorous neighbours a shortage of property , and views like this , have made @entity16 the fifth most expensive location in the world to buy property location : an aerial view showing the house on the @entity16 peninsular despite its sale price of £ 3.45 million and the potential cost to rebuild , estate agents have described the deal as a ' sensible price '			1
@entity89 , of estate agents @entity91 which sold the detached house , said : ' the property was built in the 1950s , is in need of complete repair and has no architectural merit			2
' but its location is considered an extremely rare opportunity given it affords a two - way view of both @entity103 and @entity33			2
" the internal living area is about 2,000 square feet and the price for it is a new record high for @entity16 of 1,725 per square foot			1
' the previous record was for a penthouse apartment that achieved 1,364 per sq ft in 2008			0
it is one of the last two - way plots that you can do something with for a sensible price			2
the owners of the house ( pictured centre ) will be able to walk straight onto the beach from their new property inside the £ 3.45m house : estate agents have described the deal as a ' sensible price ' the run - down house is to be demolished and rebuilt , at the cost of another £ 1m to its new owners ' the couple who have bought it plan to have it as their main home			1
there is an option to refurbish it but it is likely that they will try and remove it and start again			0
' judging by the properties either side of it , it should n't be a problem to go up one more storey and a new house there could easily be worth five to six million pounds			0
' although the existing 1950s house has no back garden to speak of , it does have direct access to the sandy beach			0
the property is one of the last of its type on the exclusive spot that has yet to be bought up and developed			0
@entity157 manager @entity156 ( left ) and former @entity159 manager @entity158 ( right ) both have homes on @entity16 and will know the area after both having managed nearby @entity163 the property has the appearance of a home that has n't been lived in for some time round two : the couple intend to submit a revised plan in the near future it is thought the new owners could spend up to £ 1 million building a modern , three - storey family home in its place			1
@entity16 is rated as the fifth most expensive location in the world to buy property , with only @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 ahead of it			1
@entity157 manager @entity156 has a mansion home there and former @entity186 singer @entity185 and wife @entity187 have holidayed there before			0
recently its wealthy residents were in the news over a story they were planning to boycott a @entity193 store which is set to open in the neighbourhood			0
aghast residents said the store would look ' like a filling in a set of teeth ' and thought a @entity199 or @entity200 would be more suited to the affluent area			0
the property is one of the last of its type on the exclusive spot that has yet to be bought up and developed in need of repair : its current status hardly befits the lofty multi-million price tag			2

price paid equates to £ 1,725 per square foot for four - bedroom house
