a new mask that lets you breathe through your nose claims to combat this problem and make first - timers feel like they ’re professionals			1
rather than covering the user ’s eyes with goggles , and then using a separate tube for breathing through the mouth , @entity15 covers the whole face			1

the mask , dubbed @entity82 , acts like a fish gill to extract oxygen from water so that the user can keep on breathing while under the sea			2
to use @entity82 , swimmers would bite down on a plastic mouth piece			0
two arms , which branch out to the sides of the scuba mask , can then function as efficient gills to deliver oxygen			0
