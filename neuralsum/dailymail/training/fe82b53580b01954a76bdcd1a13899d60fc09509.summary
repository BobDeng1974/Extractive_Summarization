in a few months ’ time , most likely before the final game of the @entity2 season on may 24 , the new television deals will be fixed in to place			2
they will fetch record fees and some financial analysts are even predicting that the overseas tv rights ( currently £ 2.23billion over three years ) will be bigger than the domestic rights ( £ 3.018bn )			1
either way , from the start of the 2016 season , the @entity2 clubs will be caked in money			2
@entity14 was full for @entity16 's match against @entity17 on sunday in return , it is time to give the game back to the supporters who pay through the nose to watch their teams			1
the @entity2 are rightly proud that the average number of tickets sold at their games last season was 36,695			2
more than 14 million supporters passed through the turnstiles at stadiums in the top flight			2
it is still boom time for the money men			0
attendances run at around 95 - 96 per cent of capacity , which is an impressive statistic given the cost of watching a team in the @entity2			2
amid all this , it is sometimes easy to forget that only 25,311 turned up to watch @entity42 draw with @entity43 last month , which is their lowest attendance in the league since 1999			0
there is one executive at a @entity2 team , anticipating the guarantee of £ 100m in tv rights a season before a ball is even kicked in august 2016 , who is considering freezing season ticket prices			1
jacking them up again will not go down well			0
however , @entity42 's match with @entity43 ( live on tv on a monday night ) was more sparsely attended other than mainstream @entity60 sports , there is n’t another industry in the world where 20 businesses are guaranteed that kind of turnover in return for 38 days ’ work			0
according to the recent @entity70 survey by the @entity71 , season tickets in the @entity2 have risen by 15.8 per cent in the past three seasons			1
good on @entity76 , for example , where supporters will be charged £ 299 for a season ticket in the third tier of their new south stand			1
this season @entity16 froze season ticket prices , but they still generate £ 109m from matchday income			1
the @entity83 could easily lose a few million on those figures and it would barely register on the record revenues of £ 420m that will be announced on wednesday			2
by 2016 a team the size of @entity16 , who already boast 12 major commercial partners , could have a turnover approaching £ 500m when the new tv deal kicks in			1
do n’t forget the fans in all of this			0
@entity95 ( £ 93m matchday income ) , @entity97 ( £ 71m ) , @entity17 ( £ 45m ) , @entity76 ( £ 40m ) and @entity98 ( £ 33m ) could still do more for their loyal support			1
@entity100 is a star of the @entity2 but some fans have to pay through the nose to see him @entity95 routinely claim that the official attendance at the @entity104 is just over 60,000 , but an audit last season revealed that the true average is actually 53,788			1
the @entity108 have previously declared that the reason for the no - shows is the price of tickets to watch the team ( the highest season ticket is £ 2013 and the highest individual ticket price is £ 97 at the @entity104 )			1
still , the @entity116 pay £ 2.50 towards the cost of every ticket for away matches , which is a token gesture of goodwill and appreciation			1
gone are the days when @entity116 could stand in the paddock next to the @entity123 for a quid , but the next generation - the 16 - 25 year olds - should not be forgotten			0
at @entity128 , where the family enclosure seats 8,200 and is believed to be the biggest in @entity130 , a dad and lad can watch the @entity128 in all 19 games at @entity132 for £ 417			0
this is an era when we routinely throw around figures about £ 250,000 a week contracts to @entity100 , to @entity136 to @entity137 or whoever happens to be signing next			0
there are fewer eyebrows raised at the astronomical wages paid to the likes of @entity136 transfer fees are also inflated because @entity2 teams have more far more money sloshing around than any other league in @entity130 football			2
it is easy to spend all that free cash			0
around £ 835m was spent in the blink of an eye last summer as clubs competed for the biggest talents at home and abroad			0
sadly , our game sometimes overlooks the fans who find the money to watch their team up and down the country			0
the next tv deal is time for the big pay - back			1
we have stopped blinking when it comes to super-sized salaries and swollen squads with players picking up big wages when they have n’t a hope of getting a game at the highest level			0
some @entity173 fans can watch @entity174 play for a whole season for £ 105 ( for a seat in the gods ) in @entity130 there is a brutal reminder that fans come first			1
the cheapest season ticket at the @entity182 is £ 175 ; at @entity173 you can watch @entity174 play in 19 @entity185 games from somewhere up in the gods at the @entity187 for around £ 105			1
most of their income is drawn from commercial contracts and broadcast rights with some of the biggest corporate entities in the world			0
in return , the fans get to watch the best players on the planet at a fraction of the cost			0
here in @entity205 , to maintain the @entity2 ’s status as the best in the world , then the time has come for to remember the biggest supporters .			0

new @entity2 tv deal will fetch record fees for top - flight clubs
season ticket prices in top - flight have risen 15.8 *%* in past three years
@entity16 and @entity76 are freezing or lowering prices
@entity16 generate £ 109m a season from matchday income , @entity95 £ 93m , @entity97 £ 71m , @entity17 £ 45m , @entity76 £ 40m , @entity98 £ 33m
some @entity173 fans can pay £ 105 for a season ticket ( in the gods )
