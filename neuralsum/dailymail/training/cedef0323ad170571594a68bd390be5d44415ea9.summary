and just to make sure everybody knew how relaxed he was , he 's even seen drinking a cup of tea sweetened he said with a bit of honey			0
the video was posted in @entity14 with a note : ' sometimes one gets tired just sitting behind the wheel , in the passenger seat however it does n't seem like work at all			1
' in an attempt to ' impress ' his friends , the lorry driver steers the vehicle with his feet to show how ' relaxed ' he is , he passes the time drinking some tea but when the video was uploaded on the internet it quickly went viral before it was removed , although not before he had been reported to police in several countries			1
the uploader claimed the video was actually shot in @entity33 but many other users were convinced it was shot either in @entity36 or @entity37			1
others quickly shared the video as an example of further stupidity on the roads and urged assistance in helping police to try and help identify where the road was and who the man was			0
after seeing the enormous amount of traffic the video was deleted by the uploader nicknamed ' vitsipo1 ' who tried to claim it was filmed in @entity53			0
complaints were made to the police after people viewed the video online the driver has been identified as @entity58 by users online with vehicles overtaking the lorry , the immense danger of the whole incident is apparent in the comments under the video before it was deleted one person even provides a name for the alleged driver , @entity58 , saying he is a @entity1			2
others found out that the was a @entity72 user called @entity73 who was a @entity1 and has a @entity72 channel with a single video that shows him acting up with his friends by undressing down to his boxers while driving , with the three young men eventually identifying themselves as being @entity1 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
