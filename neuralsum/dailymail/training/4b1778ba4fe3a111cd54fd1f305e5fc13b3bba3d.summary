by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 09:55 est , 23 october 2012 former @entity2 pilot @entity1 , 67 , who was killed when he walked into the spinning propeller of an aircraft a former @entity2 pilot who died after walking into an aircraft 's propeller could not hear the blades spinning because he was deafened by his headset , an accident report has claimed			1
@entity1 , 67 , a former fighter pilot , had just landed the @entity11 at an airstrip when he had a ' momentary lapse in concentration ' and walked into the revolving blades			1
he was killed instantly after suffering a severe head injury and pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics			2
he was said to be the ' best of the best ' in the flying world and was known all over the globe			1
the incident happened shortly after 3pm on january 28 after the flying instructor touched down at @entity25 air strip in @entity26 during a lesson to allow a student to take the controls			2
a report by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) has revealed mr @entity1 was wearing his headset at the time of the accident and may not have heard the engine			1
the @entity31 found the wind produced by the working engine when the aircraft was stationary was not particularly strong and mr @entity1 may not have felt it			1
experts also believe he may not have seen the propeller because , as although the tips of the blades had different colours , the hues may not have been visible to him			1
a post-mortem report found the injuries mr @entity1 , from @entity46 , @entity26 , sustained were consistent with him having had his head down at the time of the accident , when he was struck once on the head			1
he had no medical conditions which could have contributed to the accident , the report found			1
mr @entity1 lived in a large farmhouse in @entity46 with his wife @entity54 who is also a pilot and who he taught to fly			1
he was born in @entity57 before moving to the @entity58 to pursue a career in the @entity2			2
he was a former fighter pilot who flew @entity61 fighter jets before becoming an airline pilot for @entity63			1
the @entity31 did not recommend any specific safety improvements , but the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) is set to broaden its training			0
the @entity65 , which qualified mr @entity1 as a coach , plans to include the dangers posed by propellers when boarding or leaving the aircraft in future training			1
the @entity31 report also stated the accident illustrated the value of a procedure used by some pilots of following a path along the edge of the wing when approaching or leaving the aircraft to ensure safe clearance from the rotating propeller			2
the possibility of turning off the engine in between flights was also considered			0
however , the @entity87 ’s engine has to be started by hand , which can be equally as hazardous as leaving the engine running , especially if hot after recent use			0
tragic : mr @entity1 pictured in his @entity2 days when he flew @entity61 fighter jets speaking at the time of his death @entity94 , 67 , secretary of the @entity95 said @entity1 , 67 , was ' the best of the best ' in the flying world			1
he said : ' i can not believe what has happened			0
' @entity100 was a highly skilled pilot			2
he was the best of the best			0
' if you were going to fly with somebody he was the man you would choose			0
' he was very well respected all over the world - i have received tributes from @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 from people who knew @entity100			1
' @entity100 taught his wife @entity110 to fly			0
they keep their own @entity113 plane on their farm - it was @entity100 ’s pride and joy			0
' i know what happened but i am puzzled by it			0
if @entity100 was on an air field and saw somebody doing something wrong he would be the first to tell them			0
speaking at the time of his death life - long friend @entity126 paid tribute to the hero saying he was a true gent			0
he had just landed a @entity11 , similar to the one pictured , at an airstrip when the accident happened posting a message on a pilot forum he said : ' i 've known @entity100 for a very long time , we were in the @entity2 together in the early eighties			2
' i think of him and dot as friends - about once a year he or they fly in and we have countless cups of tea and i tease out his great stories			0
' i 've learnt a lot from him , saw him as a mentor never a peer and thoroughly enjoyed his company and his willingness to help			0
' @entity149 , who owns the airfield , paid tribute to @entity1 saying he was a ' selfless ' and ' popular ' man			1
he said : ' he is one of the most experience pilots i know - he flew @entity61 fighter jets in the @entity2 so we are still in disbelief as to how this happened			2
' he kept planes on his own private air strip and was just here to help out			0
' figures have showed that since 1991 there had been 15 accidents involving light aircraft , 10 of which occurred while trying to start the engine by hand swinging the propeller and five when passengers or ground personnel were hit by rotating propellers .			0

fighter pilot was ' the best of the best ' and well respected all over the world
