‘ this election provides @entity20 with an unprecedented opportunity , ’ she told supporters			1
‘ there will in all likelihood be another hung parliament after may and the direction of the next government could come down to how strong a presence of @entity56 there are in parliament			0
‘ if @entity1 holds the balance of power , we will use that to rebalance power and wealth throughout the @entity63 , away from the financial sector in the @entity46 and to those communities in @entity20 that need the investment			2

’ miss @entity0 ( left ) , @entity24 first minister @entity93 and the @entity95 leader @entity94 ( right ) could unite after the election to keep @entity97 out of @entity98 @entity1 , she said , had ‘ no appetite ’ to see @entity89 policies implemented by @entity4 , adding : ‘ so while we wo n't prop up a @entity89 government , we wo n't back a @entity4 government to implement austerity and @entity6 replacement either			1
