more than a dozen @entity1 spies have reportedly been caught in @entity2 and @entity3 and the @entity5 government now fears they have been executed			1
the spies were paid informants who were targeting @entity2 - which is feared to be producing nuclear weapons - and the @entity10 group in @entity11			1
their discovery is a big hindrance to @entity5 attempts to track @entity2 ’s nuclear activities and discover if @entity10 is plotting any attacks against @entity17			1
past explosions : in 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 @entity5 - were killed in an attack on the @entity5 embassy and @entity23 barracks in @entity11 ‘ espionage is a risky business , ’ a @entity5 official told @entity25			2
‘ many risks lead to wins but some result in occasional setbacks			0
’ former senior @entity1 officer @entity32 worked against @entity10 in the 1980s and said the group will often execute those it believes to be spies			1
‘ if they were genuine spies , spying against @entity10 , i do n't think we 'll ever see them again , ’ mr @entity32 told @entity25			2
other officials pointed out @entity10 killed more americans than any other terrorist organisation before the 9/11 attacks			2
in 1983 more than 300 people - including 260 @entity5 - were killed in an attack on the @entity5 embassy and @entity23 barracks in @entity11			0
spying : the discovery damages @entity5 attempts to track the activities of @entity2 and its president @entity47 , right , and @entity10 's sheik @entity48 some officials speaking to @entity25 credited @entity2 and @entity10 with their detection of spies , but others blamed sloppy @entity1 operations			1
@entity10 and @entity2 are among the @entity1 's toughest adversaries and have been improving their ability to hunt spies by relying on patience and guile to exploit holes			1
the number of @entity1 agents in @entity2 and @entity3 countries is classified - but @entity2 claimed in may it arrested at least 30 people allegedly linked to a @entity1 - run spy network			1
@entity10 - backed by @entity2 - has built a professional counter-intelligence operation they proudly describe as the ' spy combat unit '			2
but the @entity5 has had no diplomatic presence in @entity2 for 30 years and this makes the @entity1 's job of finding out what is happening on the ground all the more important			1
one case came when two @entity10 agents pretended to work for the @entity5 and the group found out where @entity1 officers were meeting with agents			1
two former officials told @entity25 the @entity1 used the code - word ‘ pizza ’ and the location was a @entity80 - but a current official denied this			2
@entity10 's longtime leader @entity48 boasted in june he had rooted out at least two @entity1 spies who had infiltrated his group ’s ranks			1
the damage to the @entity3 spy network has been greater than usual and the crisis is the latest mishap involving @entity1 counterintelligence			0
two years ago a suicide bomber posed as an informant and killed seven @entity1 employees and wounded six others in @entity95 in december 2009			0
' it all depends on who these guys were and what they have to say			0
@entity10 has disappeared people before			0
others they have kept around ' @entity102 the @entity103 last year described @entity10 as ‘ the most technically capable terrorist group in the world ’			0
@entity102 , an intelligence expert and author at the @entity107 for @entity108 , said @entity10 treats spies differently			0
he said : ‘ it all depends on who these guys were and what they have to say			0
@entity10 has disappeared people before			0
others they have kept around			0

it 's a blow to @entity5 attempts to track @entity2 and @entity10
officials warn of problems from sloppy @entity1 operations
others say it 's unlikely any found @entity1 agents survived
