@entity5 , 41 , from @entity11 , screamed as she scooped up her little girl @entity6 and ran out into the street as it careered round her home			1
her neighbour , @entity15 , 69 , dashed to help her as he chased the animal out of the house with a broom			2

mrs @entity5 said the fox got within inches of her daughter @entity6 at their home in @entity30 , @entity11			1
@entity5 said : ' it was just so out of the blue			1
i had just hung out my washing in the garden and my one - year - old was at the back door playing with the washing machine			2
' i did n't know anything about it until i heard an enormous crash behind me when this massive fox came skidding through the room and bounced off my oven			1
' it was definitely a male one because it was so big and was pooing all over the house			2
' the mother - of - two added : ' it was obviously scared and trying to get away			1
it did a circuit of the house looking for somewhere to escape , and was jumping up at the windows to try and get through			2
' i just screamed and grabbed my one - year - old and got out of the house			2
' mrs @entity5 thought about calling her husband @entity57 to go and help but he worked half an hour away			1
@entity58 mr @entity15 then rushed to her aid			2
' i ran outside and my neighbour , who is an ex-farmer , came through with a broom to get rid of it			1
it had got itself cornered in the downstairs bathroom , so it was tricky to get it out because it was a bit scared			2
' it was just so unexpected			0
i had seen this fox once before and it is so brazen it walks around in the @entity72 , ' said mrs @entity5			1
mrs @entity5 's husband @entity57 snapped this fox - who may be the culprit - prowling outside their home in december ' not really a significant threat ' : @entity78 , head of people and wildlife at @entity81 , said fox attacks were very rare ( file picture ) ' my husband has seen this one before and took a photo of it when it was standing in the road , bold as brass , staring him down			1
' because my children sleep in the cots during the day , if it had taken a different turning and had found the other children sleeping i do n't know what it might have done			0
' i am so grateful it went past @entity6			1
@entity6 was fine , and i do n't think she even noticed , but i could not see her			1
the first i knew about it was when it bounced off the oven behind me			0
' i do n't want to be shut up in my house forever as a result of this , and luckily it is very unusual			0
my garage door was open so the fox had a clear path through the house			1
usually i do not have both doors open			0
' it was a very rare chain of events , and i just ca n't believe it really			0
you think your children are safe in your own garden , but this thing came through at such a pace , and that was what alarmed me			0
' it was running at full pelt			0
that just added to my panic			0
' mr @entity15 said : ' i was just outside cleaning my pick - up truck when @entity5 came running out with the baby			1
i took the broom out of the garage for protection , but i did n't really need it because it was more frightened of me than i was of it			0
' we do have a fox problem in the area , and people ca n't leave their chickens out in the open because they will be gone			2
i just did what anyone would do in that situation			0
' people should be aware though because some people feed these foxes and they get very tame			0
' @entity78 , head of people and wildlife at @entity81 , said fox attacks were very rare			2
but he warned that people should be wary of feeding urban foxes and taming them			0
mr @entity78 said : ' foxes are not really a significant threat			0
it could be that people make them conditioned to human contact , which can become dangerous			0
' but there are thousands of cases of dogs attacking people every year			0
people should not lose any sleep over this			0
it is extremely rare for a fox to come inside someone 's house			1
