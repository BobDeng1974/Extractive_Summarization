beggars at a religious folk festival in southern @entity2 have been ordered to stay in purposely built cages , or be removed from the festivities			1
organisers gave the beggars an ultimatum saying their presence ruins the experience for visitors at the temple fair in @entity12 , @entity13 province and if they wished to beg they had to do so from inside small cages			1
the zoo - like cages are so small adults are unable to stand and although they are free to leave at will , they are immediately banished from the festival area and have to leave the town if they do so			1
caged : visitors to the town fair in @entity12 , @entity13 province walk past beggars in cages where they have been forced to stay so as not to spoil the experience for tourists the annual fair celebrates a religious holy day with a funfair , market and entertainment as pilgrims come to the temple from all over @entity2			1
due to the thousands of visitors it has become a magnet for down - and - outs looking for charity from tourists			2
‘ this year we decided we would no longer accept beggars wandering everywhere , distressing our guests and spoiling it for everyone else , ' explained one organiser before adding that no one is forcing them to beg and that they have voluntarily entered the cages			1
‘ over the last few years we have had increasing numbers of beggars turning up at the festival and it was becoming very intruding for our visitors			2
they were being harassed and made to feel uncomfortable			0
‘ we had no choice but to ban them from the grounds			0
we found the cages a good solution for everyone			2
people can still give them donations if they desire too but are not harassed and followed around the festival when they are having a day out with their families			0
‘ the beggars are quite comfortable in their cages , people send them food and water as gifts			1
in a way it is better for them there than having to find a place on the busy streets			2
' behind bars : a woman is laughing with a young child inside one of the zoo - like cages where beggars are kept during the temple festival after organisers complained they ' spoil ' the celebrations ' human zoo ' : the cages are so small the ' inmates ' are unable to stand and their conditions have outraged human rights campaigners in @entity2 who accuses the festival of keeping a ' human zoo ' ‘ our guests come here to enjoy themselves and that is our top priority			1
‘ the beggars can leave whenever they like but they have to leave the city too , they ca n't go into the fair , ’ they added			1
the cages have infuriated human rights campaigners in @entity2 who have branded them a human zoo saying it breaches human rights			1
‘ they are treating them like zoo animals			2
what will they have to do next - tricks for their food ? , ' one said			2
' this is nothing less than public humiliation			0
' ‘ do they want people to believe the region has no poor people and just put on a good show ? these people need help			0
we should not be allowing them to be locked away in cages			0
these people are human beings too			0
' locked or banned : the festival organisers have said the beggars are free to leave their cages at any time , but if they do they also have to leave the city and the fair immediately many pilgrims who had some to enjoy the fair , but most importantly honour the religious holiday , were outraged by the treatment of the beggars			1
@entity131 who was visiting the temple with his family said : ‘ i was horrified to see these poor people in cages			1
we came for a nice day out with the family , but it was distressing to see fellow humans kept like animals in a cage			0
‘ these people deserve better treatment and should be able to visit the festival just like everyone else			0
if people decide to give them food , money or water that is up to them			0
' traditionally people visited the temple to pay their sacrifices to @entity154 gods			0
thousands of people from many different provinces make the pilgrimage to the temples and due to its popularity the nearby town has turned the event into a fair with folk shows , traditional foods , markets with local delicacies and attractions for children .			0
