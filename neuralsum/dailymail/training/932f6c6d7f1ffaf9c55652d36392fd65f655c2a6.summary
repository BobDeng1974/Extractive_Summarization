a new mansion for one of the world 's richest tycoons has ruffled the feathers of a wealthy neighbour - who complained it would ruin his right to shoot game			1
billionaire @entity11 owner @entity10 won permission last month to build a nine - bed manor on his 780 - acre estate in @entity15 with a swimming pool , tea house , walled gardens and an orangery			1
but the decision to uproot a clump of ' monotonous ' poplar trees prompted a row with millionaire @entity24 , who has lived on the nearby @entity25 for a reputed 50 years			1
clash of the tycoons : property mogul @entity24 ( left : estimated wealth £ 300million ) said plans by @entity11 boss @entity10 ( right : estimated wealth £ 16billion ) would upset his rights to shoot game on his estate pile : an artist 's impression of the @entity11 owner 's nine - bed mansion , which will have a pool and a tea house stately home : @entity25 in @entity15 , where 87 - year - old tycoon @entity24 has shooting rights the 87 - year - old property developer behind @entity46 's @entity45 tower block warned the scheme was in ' direct conflict ' with ' sporting rights ' he has over the land			1
according to the @entity51 , mr @entity24 said the poplars provide ' winter holding cover ' for pheasants			2
shooting rights can also include partridge , deer or pigeons			1
the trees were due to be uprooted and replaced to improve the look of the area of outstanding natural beauty - but it is thought the process could disturb game birds and drive them away from their habitat			2
mr @entity24 contacted solicitors and sent a formal complaint via a planning agent , who wrote : ' mr @entity24 has sporting rights over the whole of the application site and all of its surrounding lands			1
magnate : @entity11 boss @entity10 , pictured with his wife @entity77 , is the world 's 24th - richest ma ' i must enforce the fact that mr @entity24 ' sporting rights are an enforceable legal profit a prendre ... and are owned in perpetuity			1
' these major landscape works ... would be in direct conflict with his sporting rights , severely compromising the exercise of these sporting rights in full '			0
in the end @entity92 ' argument did not prevent the @entity11 tycoon 's house , near the leafy village of @entity25 , from being built			0
council officers said the shooting rights were nothing to do with them - so the two tycoons would have to fight it out between themselves			1
and they pointed out that replanting a better mix of woodland trees could actually improve the environment for game birds in the long run			2
mr @entity10 's agent said : ' the poplar plantations have a uniform and monotonous appearance which is entirely alien to the locality			2
' the uniformity of appearance extends to the understorey which is managed by frequent cutting			0
' in some parts of the plantation , the poplar trees are dying , or at best are showing signs of stress and decline – making them vulnerable to wind - throw and storm damage			1
' the @entity125 chairman of fashion chain @entity11 owns almost 9,000 acres of land in @entity15 and is ranked as the world 's 24th - richest man by @entity130			2
the 67 - year - old 's new mansion will be joined by two bungalows and employ six full - time staff , with parking spaces for 12 cars			0
although mr @entity10 is a director of the @entity140 - based @entity139 , the application itself has been made through a firm based in @entity142			2
his wealthy neighbour was not the only person to object			0
one occupier of a bungalow due to be demolished for the plan complained she taught piano there and it would lead to a loss of income			0
' [ she said ] has not been offered suitable alternative accommodation by the landlord that is either of an adequate size or in a suitable location for her singing and piano teaching business to continue ' , a report said			0
@entity161 : the published plans for the @entity11 tycoon 's home ( pictured ) sparked a row with a rich neighbour wealth : the new house will be on 780 acres of land and will also include an orangery and pool building mr @entity24 , meanwhile , has lived in the luxurious @entity25 for five decades after making his fortune as a property developer in the 1960s			1
he was one of the key figures behind @entity46 's @entity45 , a well - recognised 35 - storey tower in the heart of the @entity178 which famously stood empty for more than a decade after it was built			0
he was ranked 303rd in last year 's @entity179 , which estimated his wealth at £ 312million			0
his stately home was once the target of @entity140 's biggest ever burglary on a private property in 2006 , when a gang of thieves made off with antiques and art worth £ 30million			0
ringleader @entity189 , 35 , was jailed for 11 years in 2008 for his role in the heist .			0

@entity10 , 67 , is set to build nine - bed manor with pool in @entity15
but plan prompted a complaint by millionaire neighbour @entity24
