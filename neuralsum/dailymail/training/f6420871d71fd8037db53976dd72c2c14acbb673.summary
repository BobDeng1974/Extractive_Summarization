@entity0 has been given months to live after being diagnosed with malignant melanoma a man has been given just months to live after learning a mole he developed while on holiday was in fact a rare form of cancer that has spread through his inner organs			1
@entity0 had returned from a trip to @entity10 when he noticed the large , brown mole on his back			1
after having it removed , the 24 - year - old from @entity15 , @entity16 , learned the rare form of cancer had spread to his bones and liver - leaving him with months to live			1
now he is frantically raising money for a potentially life - saving treatment in the @entity21 that is not yet available in the @entity22			0
' i was in @entity10 last july and even though i was applying sunscreen every hour , i got burnt , ' he said			2
' in january i felt something on my back and got my mum to check			0
' there was a mole and we kept checking it and noticed it was growing a lot and i went to see my doctor			0
' after being referred to a dermatology centre , the security guard was diagnosed with malignant melanoma			1
surgeons removed the mass as well as lymph nodes under his right arm and tissue from his back at @entity45 in april as part of an aggressive course of treatment			1
three months later , mr @entity0 was referred to @entity49 to take part in a chemotherapy clinical trial			1
it was then doctors revealed the cancer had spread throughout his body and he may only have nine months to live			2
' without treatment i have got about nine months to live , which is scary and upsetting , ' he said			0
@entity0 's discovered the mole on his back after returning home from a trip to @entity10			1
after having it surgically removed , the 24 - year - old learned he had just months to live as the cancer had spread through his body the security guard ( pictured with his girlfriend @entity67 ) is now raising money for a trip to a clinic in @entity71 , @entity72 , where doctors believe they may be able to treat his condition ' i can feel tired and sick and i get achy as well			1
' he is now raising Â£ 60,000 for a trip to the @entity78 in @entity71 , @entity72 , which offers treatment to stop the disease from growing			0
' after seeing my medical notes the clinic has accepted me , it 's just a matter of raising the money			0
' ' we 've raised about 11,000 pounds in three weeks and everyone has been so supportive			0
' i 've got to have hope , this has all been so devastating for me			0
' skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world , affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the @entity22 every year			2
there are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases			1
@entity100 - which mr @entity0 has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease			1
beginning in the skin , it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs			2
the most common symptom of this form of cancer is a mole , most frequently appearing on the back , arms and legs			1
these types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm			0
@entity116 has devised an @entity118 checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes : non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin			2
while not all forms are preventable , it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways			0
applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit uv rays			0
exposure to uv rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer , though family history , fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person 's chance of developing it			2
applying sun screen frequently and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer			0
