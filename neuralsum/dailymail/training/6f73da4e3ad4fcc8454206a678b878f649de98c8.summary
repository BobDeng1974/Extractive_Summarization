by @entity0 if you 've ever tipped too little in @entity2 or finished all your food in @entity4 , you may be familiar with the embarrassment that comes with a dining faux pas			1
but now a new clever infographic promises to help you sail through fancy dinners on holiday with no problems			0
revealing the dining customs for various countries , website @entity11 released an educational picture series outlining crucial dos and donts			0
in @entity18 , you should n't ask for more cheese unless it 's explicitly offered - and go for an espresso after you probably have a handle on what 's appropriate at home , but things quickly change when you travel			1
what 's acceptable behaviour in one place is seen as rude in another , and the illustrated guides seen on @entity31 prove not only helpful but a fascinating comparison			0
the etiquette in @entity4 and @entity34 is to belch and slurp through your dinner to show the chef some appreciation , but such behavior would be seen as rude in @entity39			2
do n't leave a tip in @entity34 and do n't cross your chopsticks - but slurp your soup loudly to show appreciation in @entity44 you should n't split the bill and you should use bread to help push things onto your fork leaving tips can be a minefield - with none custom in @entity4 and @entity34 ( it 's rude to tip ! ) , but around 10 per cent expected in @entity54 countries like @entity55 and @entity18			1
in @entity57 , it 's important that you finish your meal			2
wasting food is considered extremely disrespectful			0
if you 're in @entity4 , however , leaving a little bit on the plate lets the host know that they gave you enough to eat			2
in @entity4 belching is seen as a compliment to the chef - but do n't eat all your food in @entity57 , people eat with their right hand only , and all food is finished to show respect a little tip is good in @entity55 , but you should n't add salt or pepper as it 's offensive to the chef in @entity79 sharing is caring , and you dig into every course all at once			1
do n't be the guy to take the last bite !			0

leaving tips is a no - no in @entity34 but 10 *%* is expected in @entity18
you should finish all your food in @entity57 but not in @entity4
and who knew the @entity18 's were offended by extra cheese ?
