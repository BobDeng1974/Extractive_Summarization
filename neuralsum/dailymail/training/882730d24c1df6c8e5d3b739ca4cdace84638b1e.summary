@entity0 has signed for @entity2 side @entity1 from @entity3 for an undisclosed fee but he seems more worried about his chances of action off the pitch			1
the injury - prone midfielder tweeted : ' how am i gon na draw girls now ' - meaning he will find it difficult to attract girls - before quickly deleting his update			1
@entity0 struck a more conciliatory note later , tweeting the official @entity1 account with the message : ' @entity18 to see all the @entity19 there tomoz big derby @entity21 '			1
happy to be there : @entity0 poses with the @entity1 kit after signing from @entity3 tweet 's not sweet : @entity0 was worrying about his chances with the ladies on @entity28 despite his off - field reservations , the 22 - year - old has signed a contract at @entity32 until june 2014			1
the ' female situation ' @entity0 is fearing is similar to @entity1 's former @entity35 @entity34 , who complained about the beauty of girls in @entity38			1
' i 'm finding it difficult to find a girlfriend in @entity1 , or indeed settle into a decent way of life , ' he said			0
' the local girls are far uglier than the ones back in @entity45 or @entity46 , the capital of @entity35 , where i come from			0
' our women are much prettier			0
besides , they do n't drink as much beer as the @entity1 girls which is something i do n't like at all			2
' not happy : @entity34 was n't pleased with the standards of women in @entity1 wasted potential : @entity0 never truly kicked on at the @entity57 @entity0 has enjoyed loan spells at @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , but never progressed under @entity62			2
indeed , he has not made an appearance this season and played just 14 times last campaign after injuring his knee			0
he impressed in the youth set up , along with best pal @entity68 , but lacked the required quality at his favourite side and has not played in the @entity71 for @entity3 since december 2012			1
in 2012 , @entity0 tweeted : ' i ’ll never leave @entity3 even if i ’m released			2
i ’ll beg on both knees to stay			0
’ @entity62 must not have been in a merciful mood .			0
