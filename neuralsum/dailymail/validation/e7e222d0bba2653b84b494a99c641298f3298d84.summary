a mother whose teenage daughter was stabbed to death by her friend 's boyfriend has spoken of her heartbreak over the brutal murder			1
@entity8 ' daughter @entity7 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was just 18 when her life was brutally cut short by @entity12 , then 21 , an @entity14 asylum seeker who was jealous of her close friendship with his ex-girlfriend @entity16			1
determined to punish @entity16 , he murdered her own sister in front of her - and in a horrifying twist , forced her to lure her @entity7 to her death in march 2012			1
in a sickening act , @entity12 made @entity16 watch as her killed her sister @entity29 , 17 , and best friend			1
now survivor @entity16 and @entity7 's mother @entity8 have shared their experiences of that terrible day in tv show @entity35 's @entity34			1
@entity16 , now 21 , had been in a relationship with @entity12 after meeting him at a foster home as a teenager but @entity8 said her daughter had concerns about her friend 's new boyfriend			1
' she told me that she was concerned about @entity16 's relationship with @entity12			1
she felt there was something wrong with the relationship , and she said that he gave her a bad feeling , ' @entity8 said			2
@entity12 had become increasingly controlling of @entity16 and tried to cut her off from her friend and younger sister			1
@entity16 's sister @entity54 ( left ) was stabbed 15 times by @entity12 who then licked her blood off his knife he threatened @entity16 with violence and said he would harm her family and friends if she left him			1
but with the support of @entity29 and @entity7 , she eventually plucked up the courage to end their relationship			0
she could not fathom that @entity12 would be carry through with his violent threats in the most horrific way			2
he asked @entity16 to meet him at @entity29 's flat in @entity9 so he could collect some things from her			1
but when she arrived , he launched a ferocious attack on her sister as @entity16 looked on helplessly			1
she recalled : ' all i can remember now is @entity29 fell on to me and i got pushed on to the bed a bit			0
then i just turned round , and as soon as i turned round i saw the knife			0
' hearing @entity29 screaming , really horrific screams , like something that you ca n't really describe unless you have heard something like that			0
' he was like , calling her a stupid b * * * * and stuff like that while he were stabbing her			0
' @entity16 said @entity12 showed no remorse and seemed to gloat in the murder			1
' he stood up , and licked the blood off the knife , and he spat down at her body , ' she said			2
survivor : @entity16 was the only survivor of the 2012 attack that led to the death of her sister then he made @entity16 call @entity7 and ask her to come to the flat			1
terrified @entity16 complied but hoped her friend - who had career aspirations as a model - would realise something was wrong and would n't go			1
' i were hoping that she ’d be able to pick something up from my voice , and then maybe phone the police , ' @entity16 said			2
but @entity7 was a loyal friend to @entity16 and worried something was wrong with her , she rushed to her aid			1
as soon as she arrived at the flat , she was stabbed to death by @entity12			1
by then he had tied @entity16 up with cable ties so she had no way of helping her friend			1
' he seemed like he 'd enjoyed it			0
very calm , no emotion at all after he 'd done it either , just none , ' @entity16 said of the murder			2
meanwhile , @entity8 said she had a bad feeling something had happened to her daughter , who had left her a note saying she had gone to see @entity118			2
' when i saw the note i had a bad feeling			0
it 's a mother 's instinct , ' she said			2
but she admitted nothing could have prepared her for the news that her daughter had been brutally stabbed to death			0
the truth came out hours later after @entity16 finally escaped @entity128 clutches as he tried to kidnap her by taking her to @entity130 to flee the country			2
much missed : @entity16 still has nightmares about the night @entity29 ( pictured right ) and @entity134 ( left ) were killed she managed to get away and call the police and @entity12 was arrested and the bodies of his two young victims discovered in @entity29 's flat			1
@entity8 recalls hearing the terrible news after hours of anguish worrying about her missing daughter : ' @entity7 was missing for a number of hours through that night , and i just kept thinking , " she ’s dead			2
" ' it ’s not something that you can actually explain to anybody , it was just as if part of me had gone			0
it was an horrendous experience , the anxiety , feeling sick , just not really knowing what to do with yourself			0
you know , it 's a mother ’s worst nightmare			2
' when the police came and told me what had happened , i think i just went into some kind of a shock , where everything seemed surreal			0
' the worst thing in the world was always , for me , when somebody loses a child , and it was the one thing that i asked , " if there ’s a @entity170 , do n’t ever let that happen to me , do n’t ever let that happen to me			0
" of course , it has happened to me			0
' @entity12 was tried at @entity174 after pleading guilty to the two murders but both @entity16 and @entity8 were disgusted to see he showed no remorse for what he had done			1
' to hear the detail of the injuries that both these young people suffered , is devastating			0
you just think , what is he thinking while he 's sat there ? because he never showed any emotion whatsoever , ' @entity8 said			2
evil : @entity14 asylum seeker @entity12 attempted to flee to @entity186 but was foiled by a brave fellow refugee @entity12 was sentenced to life in prison , with a minimum of 33 years and 124 days			0
@entity8 said of the sentencing : ' when he was sentenced you have a kind of feeling of euphoria , because you think , you know , that ’s it , it ’s done , he ’s been sentenced , he ’s got a long sentence			0
' but that soon goes , and so , within a couple of days , actually i felt probably worse than i ’d felt for a significant period of time			0
i just fell to pieces			0
i 'm still grieving for @entity7 , as are many other people , and you learn to live with what 's happened			0
' @entity16 says despite the lengthy sentence , she will never get over the death of her sister and best friend			1
she has turned to writing to help her deal with the events she witnessed and has written a book about her experiences called @entity214			0
she said : ' since i 've started writing i 've been feeling a lot better , and i 've noticed that bits of my past and things that i have n’t been able to process so much , come out in my writing , and then i always feel a bit like i 've had a weight taken off my shoulders afterwards			0
' @entity8 added that she wishes @entity118 well and does n't feel bitter about her part in her daughter 's death			2
aftermath : police outside @entity16 's @entity9 flat following the double murders traumatised : @entity16 still has nightmares about the day her sister and best friend were murdered ' she has an opportunity now that i hope she ’ll grasp , and move forward with her life , and do something wonderful , ' she said			1
she added : ' one of the real positive actions that we ’ve taken as a family since @entity7 ’s death is to establish the @entity240 , whose purpose is to work with not - for - profit organisations who support and help victims of child sexual exploitation , or children and young people who are considered to be at risk of child sexual exploitation			0
' we 've been overwhelmed by some of the community support , and the generosity of local people has restored some of our faith in human kindness			0
