@entity2 ’s @entity1 adventure came to an end here in @entity5 on sunday but not before he provided one vintage glimpse of the talent that made him one of @entity10 ’s greatest batsmen			1
@entity11 ’s @entity2 bowed out of the @entity12 when they were defeated by @entity14 in the semi-final of a competition that has showcased much of what is good in modern @entity19 cricket			1
yet @entity11 gave an @entity1 public that has warmed to him something to remember with a switch - hit for six that conjured up memories of his prime before everything went so badly wrong with @entity10			1
@entity2 gives fans a glimpse of why his talent made him one of @entity10 's greatest batsman ‘ that ’s the shot of the tournament , ’ cooed commentator @entity31 as @entity11 hit left - arm wrist spinner @entity32 for a six that was measured at 86 metres and for a moment we were transported back to @entity36 seven years ago when @entity11 unveiled his extraordinary left - handed hit against @entity38			1
it was not enough for @entity42 as , with @entity5 turning the screw , @entity11 was unable to conjure up the match - winning performance so much of @entity1 would have welcomed with the @entity10 side that spurned him also in town			1
so it was @entity5 , complete with another discarded @entity10 batsman in @entity50 , who thrilled the capacity crowd at the @entity52 – or @entity53 as it is known for the @entity12 – by reaching wednesday ’s final against @entity54			1
@entity11 leads the @entity55 on to the field ahead of the @entity58 match with the @entity14 @entity11 was out for 31 off 27 balls as @entity42 failed to reach @entity5 ’ s 144 and was unable to add a decisive contribution to the three half centuries that have made him one of the outstanding performers of the tournament			1
@entity42 fell 20 short of that to the delight of a @entity5 crowd who provided another glowing reference for a competition that has provided a template for @entity10 to follow if the new regime at the @entity72 are brave enough to implement it			2
to watch @entity11 on sunday was to be reminded of something i wrote this time last year when @entity10 decided that enough was enough and they should rebuild without a gifted player who became more trouble than he was worth			2
@entity11 was out for 31 off 27 balls as @entity42 failed to reach @entity5 ’ s 144 it is possible , i said , to be sad about the sacking of @entity11 while also firmly believing it is the right decision and that is as true today as it was when the wounds were raw even though he has sparkled in this year ’s @entity12			2
nobody doubted that @entity11 was still capable of the odd flash of genius and it will be hugely satisfying to him that he has shown that here after being released by both @entity90 and @entity91 in the aftermath of his @entity10 demotion			2
it was a wicked twist of fate that brought @entity11 here the day after @entity10 arrived to take on @entity95 in the tri-series but there was to be no fairytale script for him , with @entity99 ensconced in a hotel barely a switch hit away			1
@entity50 of the @entity14 hits out during the @entity103 match @entity104 of the @entity55 collides with @entity105 of the @entity14 instead @entity5 and @entity106 ’s @entity50 hit a decisive half century to show @entity99 that @entity11 is not the only @entity108 batsman in the @entity12 nursing a grievance and anxious to prove a point			1
so @entity11 has , to a large extent , proved here that he can defy the flickering flame of his talent for a little while yet and continue earning a lucrative living around the world while trying to provide more embarrassment for @entity10			2
but what happens next to him will be fascinating			0
he admitted here on saturday when he talked enthusiastically and with much cricketing sense that he will have to give his next move some ‘ serious thought			0
’ @entity11 's @entity1 adventure came to an end in @entity5 on sunday as they failed to beat the hosts total @entity127 understands that @entity90 have no intention of re-signing him so it is possible he has played in @entity131 cricket for the last time , particularly with the @entity72 ’s surprise move last week to reduce the counties salary cap			1
if he was really serious about proving to @entity10 that he is still good and committed enough to play for them again , of course , he should knuckle down and play first - class cricket again , irrespective of the size of the pay - packet			0
his friend @entity139 may be inclined give him the chance to do that now he has become @entity143 ’s coach but if , as expected , @entity11 would prefer to cash in on @entity19 riches in @entity95 and the @entity145 then everyone should just accept that @entity10 are moving on without him			0
and enjoy any glimpses of his still rare ability when they are provided , as was briefly the case yesterday			0
the @entity14 celebrate after defeating the @entity55 in the semi-final @entity12 game it must certainly be hoped that @entity152 , expected to be made new chairman of the @entity72 , and new chief executive @entity154 have been watching @entity156 ’s coverage of this excellently marketed and hyped tournament			0
the @entity12 has proved that franchise cricket , watched by big crowds paying very reasonable prices , in a short sharp event can work , even though standards are not noticeably better than @entity10 ’s much derided @entity163			0
franchise cricket has been kept at arm ’s length by nervous counties up to now but if @entity10 are to reclaim the bragging rights in the format they gave to the world then it really should be considered by the @entity72 ’s new broom			0
that would be something that @entity11 would approve of @entity131 cricket ’s governing body doing			0
a pitch invader joins the @entity14 to celebrate defeating @entity11 's @entity55 during the @entity12			0

@entity2 gave the @entity1 public a reason to remember him
@entity11 hit a switch - hit six described as the ' shot of the tournament '
