@entity0 acted as a ' adoptive mother ' and ' career adviser ' to a glamorous former aide of @entity5 president @entity4			1
in a string of leaked emails between @entity9 and the celebrated broadcaster , ms @entity0 , 82 , promised to her help the 22 - year - old secure a job on @entity16 's @entity15 show and win a place at @entity18			1
ms @entity9 , whose father is @entity5 's @entity20 ambassador , was one of @entity4 's closest advisers and one one of three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails to the dictator			1
the young woman responded , writing ' you can never be a better mom to your adopted child ( me )			0
' messages leaked by @entity5 rebels in march show her asking another of mr @entity4 's advisers to tell him : ' i love him so so so much and that i miss him			1
' the leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers , including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie			0
mrs @entity0 first began dealing with ms @entity64 when @entity65 was in talks to arrange the first and only televised interview for an @entity20 network with the @entity5 leader			2
in the interview , ms @entity0 pressed the president about the thousands of deaths of @entity5 citizens and he denied having issued any formal command for such force			2
@entity76 , who published the most recent batch of hacked emails between ms @entity0 and ms @entity64 , reported that the interview was received poorly by @entity5 government officials because it ended up being more harsh on @entity4 than they originally expected			1
shortly after , ms @entity64 emailed ms @entity0 in a panic , writing that she was ' in so much trouble ' over the interview			2
a few weeks later , ms @entity64 had determined that it was time for her to get out of @entity5 and join her father in the @entity20 - all the while remaining extremely loyal to @entity4 , who she called ' the @entity89 '			1
in other emails obtained by @entity91 in march , ms @entity64 wrote that ' this man is loved by his people '			0
ms @entity0 and @entity64 continued to talk via email long after the interview aired upon her move from @entity5 , ms @entity64 applied to @entity18 's @entity97 , and hope to translate her time working as a press aide to @entity4 into a staff position at a major @entity20 news outlet			1
ms @entity0 immediately dismissed any talk of her working for @entity65 since it would be a breach of journalistic ethics			2
instead , she offered to reach out on behalf of the ' dear girl '			0
the pair appear extremely close , with ms @entity106 signing her emails with ‘ hugs ’ and ‘ love ’ and ms @entity64 promising to bring back jewellery from @entity5 for her so - called adoptive mother			1
their email exchange was obtained by @entity5 opposition forces who then passed them on to @entity76			0
@entity0 signed emails ' hugs ' and ' love ' ms @entity0 emailed @entity119 professor @entity118 , former president of @entity120 and vice president of @entity65 , to sing ms @entity64 's praises			1
' she is brilliant , beautiful , speaks five languages			0
anything you can do to help ? ' ms @entity0 wrote at the end of january			2
mr @entity118 responded that while his position at the @entity119 is unconnected to the @entity97 , he would do his best to help , saying that ' through the @entity130 network , i will get them to give her special attention			0
i am sure they will take her			0
' the attention did not appear to be enough to help the now - 22 - year - old , as she was not accepted to the program			0
mr @entity118 's son , @entity136 , is the executive producer of @entity47 , was also the recipient of an email from ms @entity0			1
she told ms @entity64 that she wrote to both @entity136 and @entity16 on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration , even though she was unsure if they had any availability			2
that specific email was not released			0
neither ms @entity0 nor ms @entity64 heard back from @entity15 or the younger mr @entity118			1
in the wake of the emails , ms @entity0 released a statement expressing her ' regret ' for the questionable decision			1
' in the aftermath ( of the @entity4 interview ) , ms @entity64 returned to the @entity20 and contacted me looking for a job			1
i told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her , ' ms @entity0 said in the statement			0
' i did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organisation and in academia , though she did n't get a job or into school			0
in retrospect , i realise that this created a conflict and i regret that			0
