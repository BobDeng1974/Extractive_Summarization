a bizarre new dinosaur with bat - like wings has been discovered by a farmer in @entity3 and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight			1
palaeontologists in @entity3 say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago			1
the strange - looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger - like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat ’s wing			1
the dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap scientists believe the dinosaur , which they have named @entity20 qi , meaning ‘ strange wing ’ , may have glided or even flown through the air			1
the discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air			0
a new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants , despite being closely related to notorious carnivore @entity37 , has been discovered in @entity39			2
palaeontologists are referring to @entity41 as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics , including its small skull and feet			2
these features are more like those seen on long - neck dinosaurs			0
the animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity37 , from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian			2
the presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds , but @entity41 shows a meat - free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought			2
the dinosaur from the @entity66 , around 145 million years ago , is named after the country where it was discovered , and @entity69 , who discovered the bones			1
palaeontologists are referring to @entity41 ( illustrated ) as a ' platypus ' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features researchers say the dinosaur , which would have weighted just 13 ounces ( 380g ) and was 33cm ( 12 inches ) long with a wings that spanned 60cm ( 23 inches ) , may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight			0
@entity20 belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes @entity37 and velociraptor			2
these dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds			1
but unlike modern birds , @entity20 qi was found to have a strange extra bone extending backwards from its wrist , rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats			1
professor @entity95 , one of the world ’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the @entity98 in @entity99 and who led the work , said : ' this is really something for me			0
it is the most unexpected discovery i ever made			0
' birds are descended from dinosaurs , but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear			0
this new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs			0
' this dinosaur is totally different			0
it has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives			0
' close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded			0
' i would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition			0
' the discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the @entity37			0
the @entity20 qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in @entity134 , in @entity135 , @entity136 in @entity3			1
the fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb , along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings			2
however , it was the strange wrists and long rod - like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists			0
there are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds , which evolved from dinosaurs , pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus , and the bats , which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago			1
most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds			1
however , @entity20 qi , which is pronounced ' ee chee ' , appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat			1
this suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly			2
the fossil of @entity179 ( above ) was so well preserved that bristle - like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones			2
the strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual this close up of the skull of @entity20 qi , which weighed just 13 ounces ( 380g ) , show oval like feathers near the head analysis by professor @entity95 and his colleagues , which is published in the journal nature , suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided , perhaps like modern flying squirrels			1
the dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight			1
instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground			0
if it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances			1
but professor @entity95 said : ' we thought giving this animal a name meaning " strange wing " was appropriate , because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind ' we do n’t know if @entity20 qi was flapping , or gliding , or both , but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds			1
' it is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists , but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors			2
professor @entity230 , from @entity231 in @entity232 who also took part in the study , said : ' @entity235 lived in the @entity236 , so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds			1
' it reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations , not all of which survived			0
' dr @entity246 , a palaeontologist at the @entity247 , warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all			0
the fossil of @entity20 qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in @entity134 in @entity135 in @entity3 the diagrams above show how the wing of @entity20 ( a ) compares to other winged tetrapods ( b and c ) and the wing of a bat ( d ) , the wing of a pigeon ( e ) , the wing of a pterosaur ( f ) and the wing of a @entity261 flying squirrel ( g ) he said : ‘ as for gliding , if @entity20 ’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil , it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing , as @entity95 and colleagues have done			1
‘ but in a gliding animal , the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal ’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift , the back end will sag and the animal will stall			0
‘ that is clearly the case in the authors ’ reconstruction of @entity20 qi , but an aerofoil that was swept back more , if anatomically possible , might have mitigated this problem			1
‘ still , we are left in a quandary : an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight , borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies			0
‘ and so far , there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure			0

@entity20 qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late @entity236
the dinosaur has an unusual bone sticking out of its wrist and had a membrane that covered it to form a wing much like that of a modern bat
scientists say it is unlike any other dinosaur , which evolved into birds , and may have glided or even been able to fly by flapping over short distances
the fossil was discovered by a farmer in @entity135 in north @entity3
