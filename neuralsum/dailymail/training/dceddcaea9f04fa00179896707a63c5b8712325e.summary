published : 06:13 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 13 november 2013 research by neuroscientists found under 25s are the least affected by charity and almost half have never donated although most of us would like to think we ’re selfless and kind , deep down this may not be the case			1
neuroscientists from @entity10 put hundreds of people through subconscious tests about their views on generosity and charity			1
it discovered under 25s are the least affected by charity and around half of those studied had never donated			1
this was despite 82 per cent of them considering themselves altruistic			0
this age group was also found to be the most sceptical about donating to charity with 67 per cent claiming they did n’t think charitable donations made any real difference			1
the most generous group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating			2
as part of the study , @entity29 - based @entity10 showed 200 participants from across the @entity33 a video about a child with a life - threatening condition having a wish granted by the @entity38			2
all the participants then completed an @entity40 ( @entity40 )			0
iats are designed to determine the strength of a person ’s subconscious association between themselves and a particular concept			0
in this case the participants were asked questions about their association between their subconscious and the concepts of ‘ generosity ’ and ‘ selfishness ’			0
the questions included how strongly they associate themselves with generosity and selfishness , how happy they think charity makes them feel and the importance they place on charity			2
they were then asked 10 questions about their likelihood of doing various altruistic good deeds in the future			0
commenting on the findings , dr @entity68 told @entity70 : ' there are a number of reasons why [ under 25s ] are less likely to be charitable			1
the study also revealed how altruistic people across the @entity33 are			0
people in @entity77 donate to charity the most while people in the east of @entity81 are considered to be the least altruistic			1
a third of @entity83 said they give to charity but are sceptical unless they see the end results ' they are particularly media savvy and socially conscious ; aware of institutions who are n’t transparent			1
they ’re more likely to respond to those whose actions follow their words , where they can see a difference being made and the end benefit to individuals			1
' the most effective way to stimulate charitable engagement amongst this group is via social media			2
under 25s are encouraged by friends who are being charitable			2
if they see their peers raising money , then they ’re likely to get involved and donate			0
' to test the results of the @entity110 , the researchers also commissioned a separate @entity33 poll			2
it asked 1,873 people about charity , donations and altruism			1
under 25s are the least affected by charity and almost half ( 48 per cent ) of those studied said they had never donated			1
this was despite 82 per cent of under 25s considering themselves altruistic			0
this age group was also found to be the most sceptical about donating to charity with 67 per cent claiming they did n’t think charitable donations made any real difference			1
the most generous group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating			0
a third of @entity83 said they give to charity but were sceptical unless they see the end results			1
while people in @entity77 donated to charity the most , the most generous age group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating			1
the study revealed many people find it hard to be charitable without knowing where their donations are being directed			1
a third of @entity83 in particular said they give to charity but are sceptical unless they see the end results ; preferring to see the direct impact of their donations			1
the study also revealed how altruistic people across the @entity33 are			0
people in @entity77 were found to donate to charity the most , while people in the east of @entity81 were considered to be the least altruistic			1
neuroscientist dr @entity68 , who compiled the report with @entity10 , said : ‘ the participants of our study saw a child ’s wish come true and it made them kinder			0
‘ we called this ripple effect a @entity162 - the participants saw the stimulus , it touched their hearts and made them more likely to commit an act of kindness			0
' dr @entity68 also noted that when people focus on an individual , rather than on a group , this level of empathy increases			2
‘ the research would indicate that those communities in which a child has had a wish granted could , themselves , become more charitable and generous minded in the future , ’ dr @entity68 continued			0
over a third of people admitted they get an instant rush of happiness after doing a good deed , and this was most common in the northwest of @entity81			0
dr @entity68 concluded : ‘ people are far more likely to be moved , and to donate more money , to a single suffering individual than to a group of people			2
in the words of @entity192 : " if i look at the mass , i will never act			0
if i look at the one , i will ’ ’ the researchers worked with fairy and @entity38 to establish which groups are most likely to behave in an altruistic and charitable manner .			0

poll finds people in the east are least likely to carry out selfless deeds
amost half of under - 25s said they have never donated to charity
they also said that they did *n't* think charitable causes affected them
this group were also more sceptical about the difference donations make
a third of @entity83 prefer to give to charity if they see the end results
