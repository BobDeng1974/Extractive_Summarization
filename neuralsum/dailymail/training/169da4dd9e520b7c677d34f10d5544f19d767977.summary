by @entity0 fired : @entity1 was paid significantly less than her male counterparts for the past 13 years the recently - ousted executive editor of the @entity5 had been paid more than a hundred thousand dollars less throughout her career at the paper than her male counterparts , new reports reveal today			1
@entity1 's unexpected removal from the paper of record came as a shock to many and once speculation began to swirl that she had raised concerns about gender pay discrepancies before her firing , the owner of @entity18 tried to dismiss those claims by saying that she was paid more than her male predecessor - a statement that has now been proven untrue			1
@entity23 was the paper 's executive editor from july 2003 until he resigned and @entity1 replaced him in september 2011			1
her starting salary at that point was $ 475,000 while @entity23 's salary in 2011 , after eight years as editor , was $ 559,000			1
the @entity29 reports that her salary was raised at some point in the past three years to $ 503,000 and then when she complained about the discrepancy recently , it was raised again to $ 525,000 - but that still left her $ 34,000 short of @entity23 's final salary			1
this is a direct contradiction to what @entity5 publisher @entity35 , said in a public statement that he released to attempt to tamper the fires once word got out that pay discrepancy was a factor in @entity1 's dismissal			2
@entity47 ( left ) has since replaced her ' her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors			2
in fact , in 2013 , her last full year in the role , her total compensation package was more than 10 % higher than that of her predecessor , @entity23 , in his last full year as executive editor , which was 2010 , ' @entity51 said in the statement			1
' it was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year			0
' december 2000 : @entity1 becomes the @entity64 bureau chief , taking over after @entity65			1
he was reportedly paid at least $ 100,000 more than she was july 2003 : @entity1 and @entity66 were appointed as co-managing editors by @entity23 , who had just been appointed as the paper 's executive editor			1
@entity1 earned $ 398,000 which was less than @entity66 , though it is unclear how much he earned september 2011 : @entity23 stepped down and @entity1 took his place , making her the first female executive editor of the paper			1
@entity23 's salary was $ 559,000 at the time and @entity1 's starting salary was $ 475,000 if @entity29 's figures are true , @entity51 's statement is factually incorrect			1
behind closed doors before her dismissal , @entity1 was reportedly angered further when she later discovered that the pay discrepancy did not just start when she reached the top of the masthead			0
she learned that she consistently earned less than her male counterparts when she was both managing editor and the @entity64 bureau chief			1
as managing editor , she earned $ 398,000 which the @entity29 reports is less than what @entity66 , her male co-managing editor , earned			2
@entity65 was paid at least $ 100,000 more than @entity1 when he served as @entity64 bureau chief before she did from 2000 to 2003			1
these figures , reported late thursday by @entity29 's media reporter @entity92 , contradict what @entity35 said in the public statement that he released to attempt to tamper the fires once word got out that pay discrepancy was a factor in @entity1 's dismissal			2
' it is simply not true that @entity102 ’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors , ' he said in the statement released thursday afternoon , one day after he announced the removal of @entity1			1
the @entity5 ' spokeswoman @entity106 has made the point repeatedly that the editors ' compensation levels can not be looked at as one solitary figure because the editors also receive bonuses , stock grants , and unspecified long - term incentives			0
# pushy : recently canned @entity5 executive editor @entity1 is using her newly discovered free time to take up boxing ... and to fuel rumors she was fired for being # pushy with this @entity120 photo posted by her daughter according to @entity29 reporter @entity92 , ms @entity106 ' conceded ' that @entity1 's recent decision to hire a lawyer to look into the discrepancy issue did play a role in her firing - not because of the famously - liberal company 's lack of dedication to equal pay but because ' it was part of a pattern '			1
@entity51 has consistently tried to paint the firing as a result of conflicting management styles - @entity1 's allegedly being too brusque and , as quoted in one report , ' pushy ' , as opposed to her replacement @entity47 who is known for being well - liked in the newsroom and more approachable than his female predecessor			2
memo from @entity35 obtained by @entity144 dear colleagues , i am writing to you because i am concerned about the misinformation that has been widely circulating in the media since i announced @entity1 ’s departure yesterday			0
i particularly want to set the record straight about @entity102 ’s pay as executive editor of @entity18			2
pushback : @entity5 publisher @entity35 has already swung back with a thursday memo to employees that said not only was @entity1 not paid less than her male predecessor , but was compensated more it is simply not true that @entity102 ’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors			1
her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors			0
in fact , in 2013 , her last full year in the role , her total compensation package was more than 10 % higher than that of her predecessor , @entity23 , in his last full year as executive editor , which was 2010			2
it was also higher than his total compensation in any previous year			0
comparisons between the pensions of different executive editors are difficult for several reasons			0
pensions are based upon years of service with the @entity180			0
@entity102 ’s years of service were significantly fewer than those of many of her predecessors			0
secondly , as you may know , pension plans for all managers at the @entity5 were frozen in 2009			0
but this and all other pension changes at the @entity180 have been applied without any gender bias and @entity102 was not singled out or differentially disadvantaged in any way			0
compensation played no part whatsoever in my decision that @entity102 could not remain as executive editor			2
nor did any discussion about compensation			0
the reason — the only reason — for that decision was concerns i had about some aspects of @entity102 ’s management of our newsroom , which i had previously made clear to her , both face - to - face and in my annual assessment			0
this @entity180 is fully committed to equal treatment of all its employees , regardless of gender , race , ethnicity , age , sexual orientation or any other characteristic			0
we are working hard to live up to that principle in every part of our organization			0
i am satisfied that we fully lived up to that commitment with regard to @entity102			0

@entity1 was abruptly fired on *wednesday* after having a lawyer look into pay discrepancies
new reports reveal @entity23 , the executive editor she took over for in 2011 , was paid $ 559,000 when he left and her starting salary was $ 475,000
her salary was eventually **increased** to $ 503,000
when she complained after learning that it was less than her male predecessor , it was **increased** to $ 525,000
comes hours after @entity18 published put out a statement saying it was ' simply not true that @entity102 's compensation was significantly less '
she later learned she had also been paid less than her male colleagues in her two prior posts as co-managing editor and @entity64 bureau chief
