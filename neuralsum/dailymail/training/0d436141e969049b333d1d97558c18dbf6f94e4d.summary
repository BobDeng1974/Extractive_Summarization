a blogger has put together a @entity7 board detailing the adventures of her imaginary daughter @entity9 , an impossibly cool little girl with a wardrobe to die for			1
called my @entity12 the page brings together dozens of photographs of ' quinoa ' complete with wryly observed spoof commentary			1
quinoa and pals @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 ( actually regular child models posing in high fashion photoshoots ) dress to impress but look fashionably bored while making scathing comments about their classmates ' bad hair or frumpy clothes			1
gems include : ' quinoa loves her friend @entity30 , but wishes that he did n't try quite so hard , ' and ' know what really gets @entity9 down in the dumps ? pleather '			2
creative : @entity34 , an aspiring novelist , says once she started putting the photos together on @entity7 her sense of humour got the better of her inspired : @entity40 's pinterest page @entity41 focuses on the adventures of @entity9 , the couture - clad little girl she never had @entity45 : @entity9 and friends manage to look fashionably bored in every shot elsewhere , a photo of @entity9 dressed in hotpants , waistcoat and a slouchy beanie hat looking forlornly into the distance is accompanied by the comment : ' one time , when @entity9 and i got separated in a busy train station , she thankfully remembered our safety training : stay in one place , look spectacular and do n't talk to poor people			1
' the brains behind the blog , @entity64 writer and aspiring novelist @entity40 , said the idea came about after she became frustrated looking at all the beautiful girls ' clothing available to buy - but with two sons , she did n't have a daughter to indulge in			1
so she invented one - and made her the most nonchalantly high fashion , cooler - than - thou child she could muster up			1
the results are hilarious - and have already gained @entity34 thousands of followers on her @entity77 page			1
@entity34 tells @entity78 on her blog that @entity77 started ' very organically ' a year and a half ago			1
funny : ' quinoa loves her friend @entity30 , but wishes that he did n't try quite so hard , ' and ' know what really gets @entity9 down in the dumps ? pleather ' ' i kept seeing cute things on @entity7 for girls , but felt i had no claim to them since i only have boys , ' she said			1
' then i thought , why not ? after all , @entity7 is really just an adult @entity92			2
so i named the board for my imaginary daughter and started re-pinning clothes from friends that i thought were cute and fun			1
' and then i guess my sense of humor got the better of me			2
i mean , come on , if i 'm going to spend time dressing an imaginary daughter on @entity7 , why not go all the way ? she was surprised by the reaction to the way she had used the site - more frequently used as a straightforward place for people to post their visual inspiration rather than a humorous site , or photo blog site like @entity113 , for instance			2
fantasy land : @entity34 says the page came about organically , and actually started as a moodboard for her to post the little girls ' clothes she loved but , as she has two sons , could not buy but @entity34 says she found it a natural place to tell a story - and says the use of humour works well in the medium			1
' i think @entity7 has always been about story telling , just maybe not in the way that i ’ve done , ' she said			2
' take a look at someone ’s @entity7 boards and you ’ll get a good idea about who they are , about their dreams and wishes - it tells a story about them			0
i had n’t realised at the time that what i was doing was such a new concept , but judging from the response , i think it ’s shown to be a great medium for creating a story			0
as for that name - which you could well imagine cropping up in the next batch of celebrity babies - @entity34 says she came to the name of her daughter after noticing that quinoa was cropping up in endless recipes over @entity7			0
' i remember thinking how funny it was that a grain had become trendy , ' @entity34 says			0
' like , so trendy somebody was probably going to name their kid @entity9			0
and then i realised that person would be me			0
' parody : the name @entity9 was created after @entity34 noticed the grain had become so fashionable someone was bounded to give it to their child as a name - then realised it was going to be her familiar face : five - year - old @entity174 style icon @entity172 makes it onto @entity9 's page as discerning friend @entity177 ' friends , i 'd like to introduce you to someone very special -- my imaginary well - dressed toddler daughter			1
her name is @entity9 , and i found her on @entity7 , begging me to give her an imaginary home filled with designer clothing and incredible lighting			0
she 's a lovely , lovely human being			0
would you like to see what she 's been up to lately ? she rides around town on her mini vespa scooter , but she always stops for @entity190 loves to dress up for church in @entity192 and roller skates , because she absolutely adores a @entity194 of her favorite activities is twirling , and nobody does it better than @entity198 do n't confuse twirling with spinning ; they are very different activities ( though she is equally talented at both )			0
every night , she lays out her impeccable outfit for the next day ... ... then prays for all the children of the world , that they might be as happy , healthy , and well - dressed as she			0
meet quinoa : @entity34 introduced the concept of her imaginary daughter and friends on her blog , the would - be @entity211 did i mention that she 's thoughtful and well - spoken ? she attended the funeral of a classmate 's hamster and gave a touching @entity216 does she shop , you ask ? where does n't she shop ? is the answer ! you want to watch @entity220 with her ? she 's got an outfit for @entity224 she lets me dress her up as a @entity226 child and we sing about raindrops on roses and all of our favorite @entity230 sure loves our country , right down to the toes of her red designer boots			0
in fact , she can recite the @entity236 in seventeen @entity237 when she 's not trying , she manages to look super cool , just like a @entity239 starlet running to @entity240 for some @entity241 's adorable at all times , even when a large spider is crawling toward her on the @entity245 should see her dance			0
she 's got the moves like @entity248 , and the charm of @entity250 , all wrapped up in a size @entity252 you accuse her of being shallow and obsessed with her looks , you should know that she 's a human - rights activist , president of seven book clubs , and is weeks away from a degree in @entity257 yes , my little @entity9 is the kind of imaginary daughter every mother dreams of			0
i consider myself very , very lucky to have her in my life			0
