' @entity5 is one of the greatest biologists in the history of mankind and his award for the discovery of dna structure must belong to him			1
' @entity5 became the first living recipient of a @entity4 medal to auction the trophy when he lost most of his income and reputation after claiming that white people are smarter than black people			1
in a 2007 interview with the @entity50 , he said he was ' gloomy about the prospect of @entity52 ' because ' all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours , whereas all the testing says not really			0

their discovery drew heavily on the work of @entity104 , whose dna crystallography photographs of the double helix were shared with them without her permission			2
her work is widely accepted to have greatly helped the pair map the double helix structure of @entity21 , and explain how genetic information is coded on to it			2
@entity114 , who was working at @entity115 , died of ovarian cancerin 1958 , four years before the @entity4 was awarded , discounting her from the selection .			0
