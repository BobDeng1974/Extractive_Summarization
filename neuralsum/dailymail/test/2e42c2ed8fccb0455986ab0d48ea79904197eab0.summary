comedian @entity0 failed to leave a valid will to deal with his £ 1.2 million estate , which experts say could leave his family with a large inheritance tax bill			1
@entity0 , who played scheming @entity7 mp @entity6 in @entity9 series @entity10 , and a host of other comedy characters , died suddenly aged 56 last june			1
but probate records reveal he had no will – even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad - bike accident in 1998 – which could mean complications for his wife of 29 years , @entity19 , and their three adult children			1
lawyers have always advised that people should have a valid will to avoid tax pitfalls			1
@entity0 , one of the leading ‘ alternative ’ comics of the 1980s , surprised doctors by making a good recovery after his accident and returned to work in 1999 , but he developed epilepsy and took daily medication			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) died suddenly aged 56 last june his personal estate would be divided according to @entity45 intestacy rules , which take into account marital status , children or surviving relatives			1
@entity50 , a specialist probate solicitor and partner in @entity53 law firm @entity52 , said that @entity0 ’s children would be automatically entitled to a share of his net estate of £ 1,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses , meaning they could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax			1
but mr @entity50 said the amount of any tax payable would depend on the value of @entity0 ’s chattels or personal belongings which would go to his wife under intestacy rules			1
mr @entity50 said that the rules for a married father like @entity0 meant his wife would be due to receive £ 250,000 plus all his ‘ chattels ’ , which would include any personally owned cars , furniture , ornaments , books and jewellery			1
by law , @entity0 ’s children would then automatically get half the remaining value of the estate , creating a potential tax bill if the amount is more than the inheritance tax limit of £ 325,000			1
@entity0 ’s widow would have received a life interest in the remaining half – meaning she could not touch or transfer that money but could claim interest on it			1
mr @entity50 added that @entity0 ’s family could seek to avoid the tax by drawing up a deed of variation to split up his estate , reducing any sum left to the children so it was below the tax threshold			1
mrs @entity94 declined to discuss the estate and the apparent lack of a will			1
at her home in @entity53 she said : ‘ i have n’t heard anything from my lawyers yet			2
’ how the ( @entity7 - hating ) geniuses behind @entity6 helped @entity102 into no 10 he 's the man behind the most roguish @entity7 mp of all – the arrogant , preening @entity6 , star of the hit television comedy @entity10			2
yet writer @entity107 also played a crucial role in getting @entity102 into @entity109 , it can be revealed			2
in the 1990s , mr @entity107 lived in the @entity111 constituency of @entity112 , where mr @entity102 would later become mp			2
he and his writing partner @entity113 had become local celebrities owing to the success of @entity10 , which ran from 1987 to 1994			2
@entity116 : @entity0 as @entity117 in the comedy @entity10			2
@entity102 is pictured right although @entity107 was a committed @entity120 supporter and @entity113 was a @entity121 , the then chairman of the local @entity122 , @entity121 , sought their views on who should contest the seat for the @entity7 at the 1997 general election			2
against their advice , @entity128 went for the one option the pair strongly advised against – @entity132			2
he would cause a political storm two years after being elected as an mp by defecting to @entity120			0
so next time the seat came up for grabs , the opinions of mr @entity107 and mr @entity113 were clearly more respected			0
when they were introduced to all five on the shortlist to fight @entity112 at the 2001 election , they plumped for an ambitious young man called @entity102 , who won the seat with a majority of nearly 8,000			0
‘ when they selected @entity132 , i told them , “ you ’re making a dreadful mistake , ” said mr @entity107 , 66 , last night			0
‘ out of the five they introduced to us the next time around , @entity102 was by far the best			0
' he was very bright and understood things but we never guessed he would be prime minister			0
@entity121 knew my political views but she thought it was good to have an outside opinion			0
i ’m a member of the @entity120 but i admire certain @entity7 , otherwise we would n’t have created @entity156			0
‘ @entity102 is a lovely fellow – a really nice man			0
he used to come to my place for tea with his wife @entity159			1
i think the nation likes him			0
‘ when he got into @entity162 , he sent us a lovely handwritten letter , saying , “ thank you so much , i would n’t be here without you two			0
” ’ asked for his views on @entity167 , mr @entity107 said : ‘ i do n’t know him			0
i do n’t think anybody knows him			0
he ’s an unknown quantity			0
if you vote for him , you ’re voting blind			0

the comedian , who died suddenly at 56 last year , failed to leave a valid will
could mean complications for wife , @entity19 , and their three adult children
his £ *1.2million* estate could be liable for tax of tens of thousands of pounds
