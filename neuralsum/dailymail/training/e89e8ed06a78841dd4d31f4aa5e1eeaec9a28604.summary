an @entity2 tourist who was attacked in @entity3 was gang raped in front of her boyfriend , it emerged yesterday			1
the young woman and the @entity8 were apparently subjected to a six - hour ordeal by three men after flagging down a public transit van in the @entity13 city			1
the horrific crime has sparked fear among visitors to the metropolis , which is set to host next year 's football @entity19 as well as the @entity20			1
the three assailants took turns raping the woman and beating the man , whom they handcuffed and sometimes struck with a metal crowbar , police investigator @entity44 said yesterday			2
the men split up the driving , ending up in @entity3 's sister city of @entity53 across , where they went on a spending spree with the foreigners ' credit cards			1
once they hit the limit on both cards , spending around $ 500 at gas stations and convenience stores , the suspects drove the pair back to @entity3 and forced the woman to fetch another credit card , mr @entity44 said			1
he said that she did not dare call for help at this point ' because the young man was still under the suspects ' control and she feared something even worse might happen to him '			2
around six hours after they were kidnapped , the tourists - both in their early 20s - were dumped by the side of highway 30 miles away from @entity3			2
they managed to reach a consulate , where staff helped them contact police			0
the woman has returned home , while the man is still in @entity13 helping officers with their inquiries			1
@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity25 have been arrested on suspicion of the crime			0
' the victims recognised the three without a shadow of a doubt , ' mr @entity44 said			0
the men 's mug shots were also recognised by another woman who said she 'd been raped by the three under similar circumstances last month			1

left to right : @entity29 , @entity23 and @entity30 , who allegedly raped a foreign tourist in a minibus in @entity3 on march 30 , 2013 it has been reported that the woman and man boarded the minibus in the @entity104 in @entity3 early on saturday many are now asking whether @entity3 authorities , who have succeeded in cracking down on much of the city 's drug violence , are up to the task of protecting the waves of tourists expected to flood the city during the @entity19 and @entity114			1
some 2million people are also expected to flock to the city in late july for @entity116 , a @entity118 pilgrimage that @entity119 is scheduled to attend			0
observers said the attack came as a particular shock given that safety has improved at least in the city 's tourist - friendly seaside neighbourhoods			2
' no one expects to be attacked in @entity127 , handcuffed and roughed up , ' said @entity128 , the head of the hotel association			0
' @entity130 is our @entity127			0
' three men boarded the minibus after the woman and her boyfriend got on and forced all the other passengers off , @entity3 police said police have said a @entity13 woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects the suspects allegedly rented their van , which seats about a dozen people and has dark tinted windows , from the vehicle 's owner , who has not been linked to the attack			1
@entity3 's van services are widely reviled for their precarious safety conditions and reckless driving , as well as their links to organised crime			1
some vans are run by militias largely composed of former police and firemen who control large swaths of the city 's slums and run clandestine transportation and other services			0
in general , tourists avoid the vans and opt for regular buses or taxis			0
@entity168 visitors @entity166 and @entity169 said they have been taking extraordinary precautions throughout their weeklong stay in @entity3			2
' we 've stayed well away from @entity130 and the beach areas at night , ' mr @entity169 said			0
' i 'm a pretty paranoid person in general and i 've heard enough stories about here to be really paranoid			0
