estate agents , car salesmen and traffic wardens will soon be replaced by robots			1
this is according to dr @entity5 , a research fellow in @entity6 , who has predicted that care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years			1
her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes			1
trustworthy ? dr @entity5 believes jobs roles such as an estate agent could be replaced with an artificially intelligent robot ( artist 's impression pictured ) in around half a century she believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate , this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life			1
according to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots - traffic wardens ( 65 per cent ) , estate agents ( 40 per cent ) and car salesman ( 33 per cent ) could soon be lost to history			1
21st century traffic warden : @entity45 showed that images produced droids could give out parking tickets dr @entity49 , who carried out her research with television channel @entity50 , said : ' all this may seem the stuff of science fiction , but actually when you look more closely , science fiction has often led the way for technology development			1
@entity58 has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			0
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity64 and @entity65 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity58 research benefits humanity			2
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			2
@entity73 warning : professor @entity65 says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence the document , drafted by the @entity77 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity58 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			2
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			2
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity58 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			0
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity58 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			0
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity58 may put millions of people out of work			0
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming			0
' look at @entity127 's communicator and tell me that it 's not a mobile phone - and his system probably did less than the latest smartphones we have today			0
' unemployment ? traditional jobs that humans take could become all but extinct dr @entity5 added : ' which would you prefer to be in the hands of ? an overworked , underpaid , disenfranchised worker doing long hours for minimum pay , or a therapeutic robot designed to respond to your every need and engage with you intelligently no matter how many times you have asked the same question ? ' imagine then , that this unit has access to relevant information about an individual 's past , so it can respond to and converse with the person ; finding ways to simulate their thinking as well as monitoring vital signs in order to flag changes early			1
' the scientist also believes that this technology could filter down to more care - based jobs : ' imagine parents or schools being supported by a dedicated childcare unit - your child 's personal friend and teacher ; a unit that delivers the right levels of work and play , stimulating our kids to achieve more , ' she added			1
results of the study even hinted that that further advances could also lead to humans investing in android companions			0
nearly half of respondents revealed that advances in technology make them fear for their job in future , with 23 per cent admitting that they think a robot could do their job better or more efficiently than they can			2
robo - puss : the poll suggested that we may even turn to technology when seeking companionship but dr @entity5 has a more optimistic perspective , she said : ' history has shown that the advance of technology often leaves us free to explore new avenues and we have adapted accordingly			1
' she predicts that in the next 50 years many of us will be turning to tourism and some of it will be in space , she anticipates a boom in human space travel where space becomes accessible to all of us			0
dr @entity5 said : ' it is a revolution we have seen before , when the @entity208 made their first flight , no one was anticipating @entity211 a mere 100 years later - space tourism could go the same way with no - frills rockets lifting off to space hotels			1
' prices come down due to commercial demand in the same way we have seen with computers , mobile phones and airline flights , all of which were once prohibitively expensive			0

dr @entity5 has predicted that care for the elderly and even children could soon to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings
she suggests that rapid advances in technology are projected to continue at an astonishing rate , allowing robots to become a *reality* in our daily lives
the research was carried out to promote the launch of @entity50 *â€™s* new series , @entity242 , which starts on *tuesday* 20 *jan* at *9pm*
