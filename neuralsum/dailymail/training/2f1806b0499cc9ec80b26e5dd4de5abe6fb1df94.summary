published : 12:01 est , 8 april 2012 updated : 13:15 est , 8 april 2012 as @entity1 looks to the future with its sci - fi - style cable cars across the @entity4 , an artefact has come to light giving a fascinating insight into the capital 's @entity8 past			1
this newly uncovered poster showing the medalists of 1908 demonstrates how the games have grown between the first @entity1 and this year 's competition			1
whereas in 1908 only 2,000 athletes from 22 countries competed in 110 events , this summer will see more than 10,000 athletes from 200 nations competing in over 300 events			2
the poster depicting the modest band of winners was due to be shown on tonight 's @entity23 , along with memorabilia from the 1908 event held at @entity27 's @entity26			1
champions : a poster showing the modest band of winners from the @entity31			2
in the bottom right is the picture 's original owner , announcer @entity33 dapper : @entity33 , a favourite toastmaster of the royals , bellows the scores through a megaphone these items were originally owned by @entity33 , who is pictured with a megaphone on the bottom right of the print			1
in the days before public broadcast systems , it was his job to relay the action to the stands			0
but he was not just any sports announcer , according to his great grandson who produced the memorabilia when the @entity52 's @entity51 visited @entity53			1
@entity54 said yesterday : ' my great grandfather was a toastmaster , the most famous in the country			2
he was the one who " invented " the red coat for toastmasters because he did n't want to be mistaken for a waiter			0
' he was a favourite of the royals , which is why they asked for him to be their score announcer at the @entity65			2
he wore a top hat and relayed the results to the @entity68 by megaphone			0
' as well as the souvenir poster - which was produced by @entity72 , a @entity27 department store that closed in 1972 - mr @entity54 brought to the @entity23 his great grandfather 's megaphone and his top hat			1
@entity76 : the @entity78 toastmaster in his trademark red coat , which he ' invented ' to set himself apart from waiters			2
his great grandson has uncovered the announcer 's @entity1 memorabilia , including a gold medal expert @entity84 described the poster as ' a wonderful print , showing all the @entity8 champions and one or two sports that we do n't have these days , such as the tug of war and tandem cyclists			1
' mr @entity54 also produced a gold medal won at the @entity65 in another long - abandoned event			0
it was won by 25 - year - old @entity96 runner @entity95 , although mr @entity54 does not know how his family acquired it			0
@entity95 , born in @entity99 to @entity101 parents , is on the far right of the poster , racing down the track towards @entity33			1
mr @entity84 told mr @entity54 : ' that 's quite incredible : a gold medal in its original leather case inscribed " @entity107 , five miles run , @entity31 "			1
five miles - they do n't do that any more because it 's in metres			0
' valuation : @entity33 's poster and megaphone come under the expert eyes of the @entity23 team in @entity53 , @entity27			1
the megaphone could fetch as much as £ 2,000 it was the last occasion on which the five - mile event was run before it was replaced by 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres			0
on values , mr @entity84 said : ' at auction , the medal would probably fetch somewhere between £ 6,000 and £ 8,000 , and on a good day might even make £ 10,000			0
' he said the megaphone could make £ 1,500 to £ 2,000			0
and he valued the poster at £ 400 to £ 500			0
another figure that has changed markedly since the @entity65 is the price tag of the event itself			0
the first @entity1 cost just £ 20,000 - a tiny fraction of the probable £ 10billion cost of staging @entity1 .			2

poster gives a *glimpse* of the first @entity1 , when just a fifth as many athletes took part
among the *people* shown is original owner @entity33 , a pioneering sports announcer and toastmaster to the royals
mr @entity33 's great grandson unveiled his *ancestor* 's @entity1 memorabilia to the @entity52 's @entity23
