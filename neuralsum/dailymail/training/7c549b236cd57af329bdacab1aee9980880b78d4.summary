whether it ’s playing @entity2 , tickling their tummy or blowing raspberries , parents usually have a failsafe formula for making their baby chuckle			1
what most of us probably have n’t done is stopped to think about why babies laugh at these things			1
step forward dr @entity11 , a @entity12 at @entity13 ’s @entity14 — or the @entity15 as it has been dubbed			1
he is overseeing one of the biggest studies into what makes babies laugh , and why			1
‘ babies are little scientists			1
they are discovering the world and through them we can discover a great deal , too			2
’ so passionate is he that dr @entity11 — a banker turned psychologist who does n’t have any children — is funding the research himself			1
he ’s created a detailed questionnaire for parents , as well as asking them to send in videos and short reports of what makes their babies laugh			1
so far , 1,400 parents from 25 countries have answered questions ranging from whether their baby was more likely to laugh at a particular time of day to which toys and nursery rhymes they found funniest			1
‘ we also asked whether they found @entity54 or @entity55 funniest and what the baby ’s general temperament was			2
we are also working on a separate questionnaire to work out whether there is a correlation between laughing babies and a calmer temperament , ’ dr @entity11 told the @entity52			1
‘ the big surprise has been that , contrary to general perception , laughter is present from a very early age , ’ he says			2
' ninety per cent of babies have smiled in the first two months and laughed just a few weeks after that , while we have had reports from parents that their baby has laughed unambiguously at just a few weeks old			1
babies cry to make you stop what you 're doing			2
but laughter is their way of telling you to continue ‘ equally , a small number reported their baby did n’t laugh at all for the first 12 months			1
this suggests babies have a range of temperaments that are present from early on			1
’ happily , mums and dads appear to score equally when it comes to making a baby chortle			0
however , it ’s the boys who seem to have the biggest sense of humour , with parents reporting their sons laughed nearly 50 times a day in contrast to a mere 37 for daughters			1
‘ this could be reinforced by the behaviour of parents , ’ says dr @entity11			1
‘ if you think your boy baby is laughing more , you may try to make them laugh more			2
’ ‘ @entity104 is a signal they want something to change , while smiling or laughter is the opposite — it says keep doing what you ’re doing			0
’ - dr @entity11 as the mother of a perennially giggly ten - month - old girl , i do n’t agree with the gender divide theory			1
@entity115 started to chuckle at five months , and laughs at anything from the light being turned on to us being stuck in a traffic jam			2
dr @entity11 is n’t surprised in the least			1
‘ @entity120 is foremost a social thing			0
you laugh in company , ’ he says			2
' one of the clearest bits of evidence we ’ve found is that it is not necessarily what you are doing , but the fact you are present with your baby that ’s important — that is why they are happy			0
‘ the interesting thing , too , is that most parents play games instinctively because babies have an amazing way of getting adults to do stupid things that benefit everyone			1
' it makes them laugh , but it is a bonding experience , too , which is really important			2
’ moreover , in the first year , smiles and tears are a baby ’s only way of communicating			0
‘ @entity104 is a signal they want something to change , while smiling or laughter is the opposite — it says keep doing what you ’re doing			0
’ the parents of three - week - old @entity154 sent the @entity155 a series of pictures clearly showing him laughing as they tickled him , challenging the idea that babies do n’t laugh until they are older			1
‘ the first way to get babies to laugh is through touch , ’ says dr @entity11			1
‘ tickling has deep evolutionary roots that come from being a mammal			0
it ’s partly related to grooming , a vital function that is also pleasurable			0
’ and as grown - ups know , tickling stimulates different nerve endings , which we normally react to with laughter			0
less surprising was that the laughter was linked to parental touch			0
‘ a professor once said the first joke humans ever make is going to tickle your baby then waiting , never quite getting to the point of tickling			0
it ’s true — it does n’t take long for a baby to respond to the anticipation of being tickled as much as the act itself			0
’ like many babies , four - month - old @entity187 always laughs when he sees himself in a mirror — though , as dr @entity11 explains , it ’s not for the reason that parents tend to think			1
‘ research suggests that babies do n’t recognise themselves in the mirror until they are at least 18 months old , ’ he says			1
what ’s so funny , then ? dr @entity11 believes that the mirroring of expressions breaks natural social conventions , and babies find this funny			1
‘ conversation and social interaction involve turn - taking , but the person in the mirror is breaking these conventions by doing everything at the same time			0
@entity208 , aged 11 months , laughs a lot in the bath , upholding dr @entity11 ’s theory of parental interaction being key to baby laughter			1
‘ a lot of parents report that their babies find bathtime funny , which i think is again linked to the supervising adult ’s undivided attention , ’ he says			1
‘ but it ’s also down to sensory pleasure			0
water is warm and womb - like			0
they also get pleasure from simple , elemental feelings and sensations			0
' one of the nicest reports was from a mum who told us her baby laughs wholeheartedly when she stands under the shower after she ’s lifted out of the swimming pool			0
‘ she described it as a laugh of sheer joy at being in the world and i think there is an element of that about being in the bath			2
’ no parent will be surprised to hear that @entity2 tops the worldwide list of laughter - making games			2
dr @entity11 believes it works because it is intensely interactive and also a game that can develop over time			1
‘ a young baby has no concept of time , so each time someone or something returns that has disappeared it is a shock			0
' and because @entity2 has their much - loved parents “ coming back ” , it ’s a happy shock for the baby			2
' over time the game becomes more sophisticated because babies develop a sense that you will come back — so it becomes about anticipation , the fun that is still to come heightens their amusement			2
‘ when they grow into toddlers , they realise they can make you disappear and reappear if they cover their own eyes , as with this little girl			0
so , in microcosm , @entity2 shows how a child develops			2
’ parents overwhelmingly reported that dolls and puppets were their baby ’s funniest toys , as three - month - old @entity274 demonstrates here			2
‘ early on , babies seem to understand at some deep level that their toys are not real beings , but are still able to have a degree of empathy with them , ’ says dr @entity11			1
‘ and they also seem to find the incongruity of an animal or inanimate toy behaving in a human fashion very amusing			0
‘ as with @entity2 , it ’s because their parent is there as part of the game , too , orchestrating the interaction			0
’ my daughter , @entity115 , is endlessly delighted by her rattle , when she shakes it and when i shake it for her , writes @entity298			0
i wonder why it is this , of all her toys , that pleases her most			0
‘ sometimes a baby ’s laughter is triumphant — a form of “ i have made this happen , ’ ’ ’ says dr @entity11			1
‘ and sometimes it can just be because there is a pleasing noise or sensation that is new to them			0
i think there can be a cause - and - effect connection , too			0
‘ one of the videos we ’ve been sent is of a baby laughing when their parent presses a light switch and the light comes on and goes off			0
it ’s hilarious every time , and it is the same thing with a noisy rattle			0
‘ @entity115 probably does n’t quite understand what she — or you — is doing to make it noisy , but is nonetheless delighted it makes a noise			0
