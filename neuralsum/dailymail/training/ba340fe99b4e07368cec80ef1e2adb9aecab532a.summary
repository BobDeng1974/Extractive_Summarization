' if unclear , then the assessing doctor or practitioner will ask further questions and may seek assistance from a senior colleague or on occasion , to social care colleagues			0
' it is important to emphasise that this is no reflection on parents or responsible adults who bring in their injured child for treatment , but we believe parents will understand the need to ensure that children are safe to be discharged following treatment			0

' the couple are still in the dark about what actually happened to their child , who has been left with scarring			0
mrs @entity1 said : ' @entity2 was n’t showing many signs of distress initially but this is because it turns out her hand was so badly burnt she had lost feeling in it			1

she said : ' it was first suggested by the nursery that @entity2 was burned by her baby food , but the reports from the day recorded all the food temperature and this possibility was discounted by the consultant at @entity169 due to the nature of the burn			2
' another suggestion was @entity2 burnt her hand on an exposed radiator pipe , but mrs @entity1 claims the the burns consultant said her daughter ’s hand would have to have been pressed against the pipe for a long time to sustain her injuries			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' we hate the thought of anything happening to our daughter , and other children while in the care of nurseries and we just want to know what happened so we can prevent it happening again			2
