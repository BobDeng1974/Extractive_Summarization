@entity0 , the 16 - time world champion , avoided a giant - killing by the giant @entity3 @entity2 on friday night to reach the 20th world semi-final of his illustrious career			1
the 54 - year - old believes this is his last realistic opportunity to lift the @entity9 trophy			1
and he remains on track with that target , moving into the semi-finals of the @entity13 with a 5 - 3 victory at @entity15			1
from the @entity18 's perspective , though , this was an edgy and nervous win against a 6ft 5in opponent who has been struggling with a severe back problem			1
@entity0 , who won his first world crown , albeit the @entity23 version , nearly 25 years ago , appreciated afterwards that he came close to being toppled , especially as @entity24 der @entity2 led 3 - 2 in sets after being 2 - 0 down			1
@entity2 was in agony with his back			1
i tried to extend the game as long as i could			0
he was in trouble and yet he was still hitting his scores and 180s			0
i need to rest now because i ' m shattered			0
' @entity0 , as he has done so often in the past , asserted his authority on this match in the opening stages			2
when @entity30 missed the bullseye on a 126 finish in the fifth leg of the first set , @entity0 punished him with an 87 checkout			2
his average of 107.82 after five legs gave the impression he was in the mood for an early finish			0
it was a similar story in the second set as , after @entity57 missed three darts for 16 , @entity0 nailed 80			2
yet the 39 - year - old @entity3 refused to lie down and reacted by winning three successive sets in a row , taking nine of out 11 legs			2
in the fourth set , @entity24 der @entity2 knocked off 113 and 107 , both on a double 20 finish ; in the fifth , he took out 100 and 104 against @entity0 's throw and enjoyed a three - dart set average of 120.61			1
@entity0 clenches his fist as he celebrates winning a leg during the match at @entity15 @entity30 ( left ) celebrates going 3 - 2 ahead but it was n't enough to beat @entity0 who came back to win 5 - 3 however , the sixth set end up being a pivotal one in terms of the narrative of this match			1
had @entity0 lost , he would have gone 4 - 2 behind			1
instead the relieved @entity79 thrower won it to draw level at 3 - 3 apiece – but he only sealed the leveller with his 21st dart and surprisingly after missing eight darts at the double			1
little wonder that he celebrated by sticking his index finger to his temple and mouthing to the crowd the words : ' this is doing my head in – i need bloody shooting ! ' the pressure on his shoulders eased in the seventh set as he won it against the throw			0
and the eighth set was a mere formality as he booked yet another semi-final appearance			2
@entity30 said : ' i gave it everything i had			0
it just was n't good enough			0
i do n't want to use my back as an excuse			0
i lost to the better player			0
' @entity0 will face @entity109 who overcame reigning @entity23 world champion @entity110 in a 5 - 4 thriller			1
the two men matched each other almost all the way , but @entity115 broke the game in his favour with a 124 checkout to go two - up midway through the final set			2
' i needed extra eyes in set five because i could n't see , it was all blurred , ' the @entity3 said before taking the microphone and turning to the crowd to praise his opponent			0
' this man here , he won everything in the @entity23 and then he said i will come over , i want to play with the @entity127 and he is one of the best			0
' @entity110 , you are a world class player			0

@entity0 avoided a giant killing to win 5 - 3 against @entity2
the win put the @entity18 into the 20th semi-final of his career
he believes this is his last realistic chance to lift the @entity9 trophy
