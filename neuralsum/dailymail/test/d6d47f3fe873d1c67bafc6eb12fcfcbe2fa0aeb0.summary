@entity0 and his @entity2 colleagues have got their preferred venue by securing @entity5 ’s @entity4 as the place where they will take on @entity8 in their quarter final			1
the venerable club in @entity11 will host @entity13 ’s biggest home tie in three decades from july 17 - 19 , after agreement was reached between its management and the @entity17 today			1
@entity19 captain @entity18 and his lead player had made it clear that they wanted to take on the strong @entity8 team on grass , as it would appear to give them fewer selection options from their rich resources			1
@entity0 in action last year at the @entity4 , which will host the @entity2 quarter final against @entity8 @entity0 celebrates winning at @entity30 's in 2013 - one of three triumphs he has had at the tournament tickets go on sale on may 27 and the match is sure to sell out quickly with the likely capacity of the one court used being around 7,000 , as it is for the @entity38 , which takes place two weeks before @entity40			1
the @entity42 ’s overworked show courts , plus the redevelopment work being done there , meant that @entity44 was never an option only five days after the @entity38 finish			0
the fixture means a bumper helping of six weeks ’ top level grass court tennis in the @entity19 this summer , a far cry from 20 years ago when some believed the sport ’s one organic surface might even disappear			0
this time there will be three weeks between @entity54 and @entity40 , so by the time gb take on @entity8 for a place in the @entity2 semi-finals all the players will be perfectly attuned to the grass			1
the court at @entity30 is at least the equal of @entity40 in terms of quality , and the atmosphere will be very different from the usually staid one that accompanies the principle warm - up event for the big fortnight			2
thanks to @entity0 , @entity68 and @entity8 look well - matched and it could well depend on who wins the doubles rubber on the saturday			2
@entity8 has seven players in the world ’s singles top 50 , although some have been affected by injuries this season			0
however , they will be encouraged by the recent comeback of @entity79 , who is their best grass court exponent and looking in decent form after overcoming arm problems			0
he has done well at @entity30 ’s before but his record is not as impressive as that of @entity0 , who has won the @entity89 title three times			2
@entity0 said : ' @entity30 will be a perfect venue for our quarter - final match against @entity8			1
i ’ve been playing at @entity30 ’s for ten years now so i feel very at home there as do the rest of the @entity19 team , so it ’s a great choice			0
fingers crossed it ’s a memorable summer for @entity19 tennis			0
' @entity79 is back to form after overcoming an arm problem and will be a big threat for the @entity8			0

@entity4 will host @entity13 's quarter final against @entity8 in july
@entity0 and gb captain @entity18 were keen to play at @entity30 's
tie is five days after @entity40 finishes so could not be played at @entity44
