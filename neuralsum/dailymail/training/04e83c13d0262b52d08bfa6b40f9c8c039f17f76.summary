no messing , no mistake			0
not when it really mattered			0
from the penalty spot in the 92nd minute , he coolly , expertly , steered @entity11 to their opening @entity13 victory against @entity14 on tuesday night			1
visiting coach @entity15 claimed his side deserved better and he was right			0
but no one in red really cares and why should they ? an injury - time penalty , taken in front of the @entity22 for good measure , is @entity5 territory , all right			1
he scored and @entity11 are off to a winning start in @entity27 @entity11 captain @entity5 keeps his cool to slot home an injury - time penalty to give the @entity31 victory against @entity14 skipper @entity5 punches the air with delight after winning the game for @entity11 from the spot @entity37 is embraced by @entity4 and @entity38 as the rest of the @entity11 team celebrate the winning strike substitute @entity42 congratulates @entity43 after the defender was brought down in the area by goalkeeper @entity46 during the dying stages @entity4 gives @entity11 the lead late on as the @entity51 fires the ball past a sprawling @entity46 in the @entity14 net @entity14 ' @entity54 midfielder @entity53 rounds @entity11 goalkeeper @entity55 to equalise for the away side in the final minutes of the match @entity4 and @entity38 ( right ) went close in the first half for @entity11 but were denied by the @entity14 goalkeeper before the linesman called for offside @entity4 posted a snap with @entity5 after the game on @entity63 and said : ' @entity5 ! yes ! good start guys ! thanks supporters ! you were amazing !

@entity104 : @entity70 referee : @entity106 ( @entity107 ) , 6 * @entity109 ratings by @entity110 at @entity111 they had conceded an equaliser in the 90th minute and @entity43 won the penalty 60 seconds later			2
it was exhilarating and there was barely time to pause for breath before the @entity22 was in full song			0
they ca n’t get enough of this team			0
it would be easy to tell another tale , the real story behind the 81 frustrating minutes of this game until @entity4 scored for the first time in a @entity11 shirt			1
to do that , though , would be to highlight the technical difficulties this team encountered against spirited and somewhat unfortunate @entity131 opponents			2
far better to stick with the romance , to fuel those @entity13 desires and speak of a dream that ends with @entity11 walking out for the final in @entity136 next june			2
how they have missed these @entity139 nights , a glaring omission from the @entity111 calendar over the past five seasons			0
@entity5 was certainly psyched up , admonishing @entity73 for giving the ball away cheaply in the opening spell and having another crack at the little @entity147 when he shoved @entity148			2
at times , this new , withdrawn position carved out for @entity5 to spare his ageing legs must frustrate the @entity11 captain			1
until he struck the winning goal , he rarely crossed the halfway line			0
there was so much enthusiasm about the place , so much energy in those red shirts that they spent too much time throwing bodies forward for the majority of the game			0
it will come together — it has to with a team boasting the creative talents of @entity38 , @entity72 and @entity73 in that forward line			0
add the attacking thrust of @entity70 , with those eye - catching runs down the left and his brilliant recovery tackles , and @entity11 will give anyone a game at this level			1
the target is to get to grips with a dual season , competing at the top of the @entity180 at the weekend and then facing the challenge of @entity14 , @entity182 and @entity183 on these midweek nights			2
@entity11 's @entity72 , signed from @entity185 this summer , hauls down @entity92 in a bid to win the ball @entity72 fires a shot from the edge of the area towards goal but the ball is cleared by @entity91 before it reaches the goal @entity11 defender @entity69 shows his skill to move the ball away from @entity14 frontman @entity194 the @entity131 champions were decent enough , forcing corners in the first half and relying on @entity91 and captain @entity89 to get them going			1
they certainly gave @entity11 a game , capitalising on the growing sense of anxiety which was spreading as this fixture wore on			2
there is time and @entity11 had 90 minutes , plus all the other bits and pieces added on at the end of each half , to win their first group game			1
they had to use all of it			0
when they scored through @entity4 , @entity11 should have settled and protected their lead			1
by then they had worked hard enough for it			0
the goal arrived via the dangerous left - boot of @entity70 — a swirling cross that found its way to the feet of @entity4 inside the box			2
his finish was cool , under pressure to perform after a couple of games without a goal since his return to @entity229 football			0
he is off the mark now			0
@entity231 : click here for your ultimate stats package from the big game - including @entity4 's opener for @entity11 , as illustrated here @entity11 's @entity238 winger @entity73 is dispossessed by @entity91 ( right ) in the tackle @entity38 grimaces as the wideman races past the challenge of @entity14 player @entity242 along the touchline @entity11 's new summer signing @entity70 marauds forward with the ball and puts the @entity14 backline on the backfoot the game was nearing its end when @entity4 scored in front of the @entity22 and that should have been the signal for @entity11 to smother the contest and see it out			1
@entity254 knows they had enough players on the park equipped to do so			0
@entity5 , @entity71 and substitute @entity74 are streetwise enough to put their foot on the ball			2
instead , with the vocal backing of the @entity22 , they set off in search of a second goal			0
to blame @entity38 simply because he lost the ball on the edge of the @entity14 penalty area would not do justice to his energetic and captivating peformamce			2
nevertheless , @entity14 sped away with the ball and within seconds of @entity38 being dispossessed , substitute @entity53 was rounding @entity55			1
@entity11 captain @entity5 races forward past @entity92 during the @entity31 ' first @entity13 fixture of the season @entity11 's new deputy captain @entity71 launches a forward ball during the @entity31 ' @entity13 clash at @entity111 on tuesday night @entity4 evades the challenge of @entity14 defender @entity91 during the opening stages of @entity11 's @entity27 clash @entity4 , who arrived at @entity111 in a £ 16million deal from @entity275 , wipes his face with his shirt after going close for @entity11 it was a classic @entity139 counter-attack			1
@entity111 fell flat , at least until @entity43 was bundled over by @entity46 inside the area			1
@entity82 admitted afterwards : ‘ @entity5 studied videos of their keeper , but then they put in @entity46 at the last minute and we had nothing on him			1
’ it required a cool finish , the game - changing strike that we associate @entity5 with over the years			1
naturally , he did n’t let anyone down			0
@entity14 players @entity292 goes to ground under the challenge of @entity38 @entity68 ( left ) watches on as @entity43 moves forward after getting the better of @entity92 @entity11 supporters show their support for the club ahead of the @entity31 ' return to the @entity13 after five years away video we showed great resilience			1
