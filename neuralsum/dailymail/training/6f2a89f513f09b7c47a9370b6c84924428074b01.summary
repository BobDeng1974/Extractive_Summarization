the 42 - year - old , who is writing a memoir about growing up with one of the most renowned men in the @entity13 crime underworld , recalls how her father could kill someone and then watch tv with her ' five minutes later '			1
@entity1 , who was known to peers as the @entity17 , was an integral part of the @entity20 mob war - boasting that he gave up counting his murder victims after killing 50 people			1
brutal : @entity2 is writing her memoirs about growing up with notorious mob boss , @entity1 , as her father			1
@entity1 - known as the @entity17 - boasted that he gave up counting his murder victims in an interview with the @entity27 , @entity2 describes her upbringing as ‘ like growing up with a serial killer			1
’ remembering her painful childhood , @entity2 , who was known as @entity32 while her mother was dubbed @entity34 , told the paper : ' he could transform himself			1
he could go kill someone and five minutes later he ’d be home watching @entity38 with my brother and me			1
' and @entity2 reveals how her gangster father would take savage revenge on anyone who interfered with her , including one a boy who dared kiss her on her doorstep			1
a particularly haunting memory dates back to 1983 , when 14 - year - old ' @entity32 ' was assaulted by @entity49 , a driver who was taking her to school			0
@entity49 pulled over the car before tearing the buttons off the schoolgirl ’s shirt and licking her hand			0
gangster : @entity1 , pictured here with his wife , ' @entity57 ' , was one of the most feared mob bosses in @entity13 's organised crime world - he is thought to have killed at least 50 people @entity63 marriage : big @entity2 , right , was wife of mobster @entity66 ' the @entity17 ' @entity1 , a @entity20 who once said he had stopped counting the number of his murder victims at 50 thinking quickly , she avoided further abuse by telling her attacker she would meet him after school instead			1
she called her mother from the school in floods of tears			0
of course , @entity57 told @entity1 who found out where @entity49 lived and marched to his home – armed with a cane			1
after charming @entity49 into walking with him to the park , @entity1 ’s gang pounced and carried out a violent attack that left the driver with a broken nose , wrist and ribs			1
@entity1 himself beat @entity49 so viciously that he broke his cane			2
weeks later @entity49 was gunned down in broad daylight by @entity1 ’s oldest son , @entity91 no one was charged with the killing			2
widow : ' @entity57 ' was left widowed after @entity1 died of @entity95 in 1994 @entity2 remembers her father telling her that she did n’t have to worry about that guy anymore			1
the so - far innocent teen found out what her father meant when she later overheard the gang , gathered in her living room , discuss how @entity49 tried to run for his life before being shot in the head			0
but friends of the girl who committed far less serious transgressions were also attacked by the @entity17			2
a 14 - year - old boy , whom @entity2 described as her ‘ best friend ’ , had his face beaten in after he smoked marijuana with the mob boss 's daughter			1
‘ how he survived , i do n’t know — it was a massive beating , ' @entity2 recalls to the @entity27			2
' @entity91 said , " see , this is what happens when you give my daughter drugs ! " ' @entity1 called himself ‘ @entity119 ’ – even signing letters to his family ‘ km ’ but @entity2 also remembers him as a ‘ loving father			1
’ ' my father was a different type of gangster			0
he let us know what was going on — street business , if they need to hit someone			0
it made me fear telling him things			0
but i was so much of a daddy ’s girl			0
and he was extremely loving and caring towards us			0
he was my best friend , ' she told the @entity27			0
however , describing him as a ‘ family man ’ would be fanciful as @entity2 believes that among his victims was @entity1 's own brother , her uncle @entity141			1
another victim of the gang life was @entity1 ’s son , @entity142 , who was shot in the eye during one fight before being shot dead less than a year later in the early nineties			2
@entity2 also recounts discovering her father 's big secret - that he was also working for the @entity149			2
broken family : @entity1 with daughter ' @entity151 ' and son @entity142 , who died in a mob shooting after confessing that @entity149 agent @entity154 was his boss , @entity1 instructed his daughter not to mention the cop 's name outside their house			1
she said : ' he used to tell us he was @entity161			0
so i asked , ‘ what do you mean , you ’re an agent ? ’ he loved those movies			0
he ’d say , ‘ i ’m @entity161 , @entity166			0
' @entity1 himself was arrested in 1992 for murder and racketeering , and died just two years later from @entity95			2
but despite the wealth he enjoyed while he was alive , his millions vanished after his death , leaving his family with nothing			0
until recently , @entity2 supported her mother and three young children by working as a liquor and beer - sales rep. she described writing the book as ‘ very hard ’ emphasising that she did not want to ‘ hurt people [ or ] glorify this life			1
’ ‘ this life destroyed my family , ’ she added			0
@entity32 eventually got married , at age 21 , to a banker from @entity186			0
@entity1 initially supported the marriage , but came to believe the husband was a threat			2
she said : ' he said , ‘ i want to kill him , but i need your permission			2
i do n’t want you to live with the guilt			0
'' @entity194 said , ‘ you ca n’t do that ! ’ but ultimately , he was right			0

@entity2 , 42 , was daughter of notorious @entity13 mobster @entity1
writing memoir about growing up with the man dubbed ' the @entity17 '
' he could kill someone , then watch tv with me five minutes later '
