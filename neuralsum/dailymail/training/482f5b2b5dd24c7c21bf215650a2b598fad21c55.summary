the @entity11 , named after the father and grandfather of senator @entity14 , was dispatched monday from its port in @entity17 and ordered to sail for @entity3			0
the 505 - foot guided - missile destroyer carries the @entity20 's advanced @entity19 , a sophisticated radar system designed to target enemy missiles and launch precision rockets to intercept and destroy them			0
the @entity20 also shifted the @entity24 , a $ 900million floating radar platform that has even more powerful equipment for tracking missiles			0
' the two pieces of @entity20 hardware join an unknown number of f - 22 stealth fighter jets that the @entity46 sent to @entity37 as both a show of force against the @entity3 and a pledge of support for its allies in @entity52			1
the @entity46 has previously flown @entity53 and @entity55 bombers over the @entity10 with the same aim			0
moving : a f - 16 fighter jet comes in for a landing as a- 10 jets move to take off at a @entity2 air force base in @entity61 , south of @entity52 today take off : @entity63 10 jets prepare to take off at a @entity2 air force base in @entity61 , south of @entity52 earlier today @entity66 practice : @entity3 has released video footage of soldier firing at cartoon - lie targets of @entity2 soldiers @entity3 today announced that it would kick - start its nuclear programme once again by re-opening a complex which was closed as part of disarmament talks six years ago			1
a file handout satellite image shows the @entity6 complex nuclear facility @entity3 will rebuild and restart nuclear facilities including a mothballed uranium enrichment facility and a 5 mw reactor , both in @entity6 , @entity77 quoted a spokesman at its atomic energy agency as saying			1
@entity83 is estimated to have enough fissile material to build up to eight nuclear bombs , although estimates vary			0
according to estimates from the @entity88 from late 2012 , @entity3 could have enough weapons grade uranium for 21 - 32 nuclear weapons by 2016 if it used one centrifuge at its @entity6 nuclear plant to enrich uranium to weapons - grade			1
' @entity96 @entity95 ... decided to adjust and alter the uses of the existing nuclear facilities , to begin with , ' @entity77 reported			0
it said the nuclear facilities would be used for both electricity and military uses			0
it was not clear how long it would take to restart the reactor , whose cooling tower was blown up in a made - for - tv event in 2008 under an agreement to suspend the atomic complex			0
@entity3 , led by @entity39 , has stepped up its fighting talk with a series of warnings and threats in recent weeks there have been reports of construction work near where the tower once stood but it was not clear whether the @entity3 was rebuilding it			0
on saturday , @entity3 said it was entering a ' state of war ' with @entity37 but the statement was played down by @entity52 and the @entity2 as the latest piece of ' tough talk ' from @entity83			1
today the @entity125 chief says he fears @entity3 is on a collision course with other nations that could lead to war			1
@entity125 @entity129 ban ki - moon says the isolated @entity131 nation appears to be ' on a collision course with the international community ' amid rising tensions on the @entity10			2
@entity129 , a former @entity37 foreign minister , said tuesday in @entity135 ' the current crisis has already gone too far ' because of escalating tensions raised by @entity3 's threats of war almost daily against the @entity2 and @entity37			1
he said international negotiations are urgently needed but he is ' convinced that no one intends to attack ' @entity3			0
@entity83 has sought disarmament - for - aid talks with @entity143 and more domestic loyalty by portraying @entity3 leader @entity39 as a powerful commander			0
the @entity2 has responded to the threats by sending @entity147 to join @entity37 military exercises ( file photo ) tensions have been high on the @entity10 since @entity39 ordered its third nuclear weapons test in february , breaching @entity125 sanctions and ignoring warnings from @entity155 , its closest ally , not to do so			1
the test drew further @entity125 and bilateral sanctions designed to pressure @entity3 to stop its nuclear weapons program			1
instead , @entity83 has responded with a campaign of threats , including a vow to launch nuclear weapons at the @entity2 , and a series of warnings			2
over the weekend , the @entity3 's top decision - making body said nuclear weapons are ' treasure ' and the ' nation 's life ' and will not be traded for billions of dollars , the latest in a series of provocative statements from the rogue state			1
' [ @entity3 ] will achieve nothing by threats or provocations , which will only further isolate @entity3 and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in north - east @entity131 , ' the @entity2 said in a statement			2
sabre - rattling on the @entity10 also drew a plea for peace from @entity184 , who in his first @entity186 address called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis			0
' peace in @entity131 , above all on the @entity10 : may disagreements be overcome and a renewed spirit of reconciliation grow , ' he said			0
after the @entity3 's young leader @entity39 chaired his first plenary meeting of the ruling worker 's party central committee yesterday , a statement to the official @entity77 news agency said the country 's nuclear weapons ' are neither a political bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at forcing [ @entity83 ] to disarm itself '			2
pope @entity184 called for a diplomatic solution to tensions in the @entity10 in his @entity186 address yesterday an unknown number of radar - evading @entity213 were deployed to @entity214 , the main @entity2 air force base in @entity37 , from @entity17 to take part in the annual joint @entity217 military drills , which prepare the allies to defend the @entity37 from a @entity3 attack			1
on thursday , the @entity2 performed a rare show of force aimed at the @entity3 by dropping dummy munitions from two @entity53 stealth bombers on practice runs over @entity37 , which led to @entity39 putting the @entity226 's missile units on standby to attack @entity2 military bases in the @entity37 and the @entity228			1
the two @entity229 have been in a state of war since the truce that ended their 1950 - 53 conflict			0
despite the threats from the @entity3 , few believe @entity83 will risk near - certain defeat by restarting a full - scale war			2
on saturday , @entity3 declared it was entering a ' state of war ' with the @entity37 analysts say the threats are more likely to be efforts to provoke softer policies toward @entity83 from a new government in @entity52 , to win diplomatic talks with @entity143 that could get more aid for the @entity3 and to strengthen the young @entity3 leader 's image and military credentials at home			1
@entity17 's top government spokesman @entity250 condemned @entity3 for ' aggressive provocation ' after @entity39 's ruling party newspaper , the @entity252 , identified @entity2 military bases in @entity17 as targets for attack			2
@entity83 justifies its own nuclear pursuits largely on a perceived threat from the @entity2			0
the @entity259 says the @entity2 is taking @entity3 's threats seriously , but has also noted @entity83 's history of ' bellicose rhetoric ' .			2
