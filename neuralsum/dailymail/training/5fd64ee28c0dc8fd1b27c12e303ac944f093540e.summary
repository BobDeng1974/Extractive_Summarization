click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game , including @entity5 's heatmap more than any other teams in world football , @entity8 and @entity9 have come to be defined , in recent years , by their no 10s			1
in @entity16 duo @entity14 and @entity5 , the @entity13 giants have arguably the best two players in the world in that position , and both teams are built around their respective superstars			1
but how did the pair compare when they met in @entity24 on saturday ? @entity16 striker @entity5 , celebrating with goal scorer @entity25 , was in fine form against @entity9 influence it might not be right to describe @entity8 vs @entity9 as simply @entity5 vs @entity14 - but both teams rely so heavily on their star man that if either goes missing , the whole side can lose their way			1
@entity8 , as the @entity32 showed , are only as good as their no 10 , while @entity14 , on his day , can carry @entity9 almost single - handedly			1
it 's not enough to be good , these two have to dominate the whole game to earn praise			0
in the first half hour , there is no doubt who was winning this battle			0
@entity14 was involved in everything good that @entity9 did , getting on the ball in deep areas , committing defenders and feeding his team - mates			1
not only did he beat defenders himself , but his very presence drew men away from his fellow forwards			2
@entity51 and @entity52 had more space than they would normally be afforded by virtue of playing alongside @entity14			2
here is @entity14 's heatmap from the friendly showing a strong attacking presence for @entity9 @entity8 forward @entity5 challenges for a set piece during his impressive performance for his national side @entity5 , heatmap above , was key to @entity8 's forward play , particularly on the left and down the centre @entity5 , meanwhile , was left isolated for much of the first half , lurking on the lonely left wing while @entity8 struggled to get a foothold			1
it was clear , whenever @entity72 's side won the ball , that they were looking to their talisman for a lift , but possession was so rare ( less than 35 per cent in the first half ) that he was a peripheral figure			0
in fact , @entity8 's @entity78 made just 10 passes in the entire first 45 minutes , less than a third of @entity14 's tally - and three of those 10 failed to find a team - mate			1
but , after @entity25 's opener , the 22 - year - old came to life			2
dazzling dribbles , incisive passes , and very nearly a superb solo goal			0
suddenly @entity5 , without having too much of the ball , was the most exciting player on the pitch			2
every time he got the ball he looked to have the beating of a desperately slow @entity9 defence			2
his pace and threat brought fouls and cards , and by the end of the game there was little doubt who the most threatening player on the pitch was			0
@entity14 : 5/10 neymar 9/10 @entity14 looks dejected after missing a chance for @entity9 during the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity8 in @entity106 creativity both players are absolutely vital to their side 's chance creation			1
despite @entity113 duo @entity111 and @entity114 alongside him , @entity5 is the only genuine creative focal point in the @entity8 side			2
@entity9 have a few more options , with @entity51 in particular diverting some of the pressure off @entity14 's shoulders , but the diminutive genuis is still the key man			1
neither of the two were particularly wonderful in a first half which lacked many clear - cut chances , but @entity14 offered slightly more , creating two chances for @entity52			2
first he slid @entity125 in behind before the full back 's cross was mishit by @entity52 , then he put the @entity130 striker in down the right hand channel , only for the forward to blaze over the bar			0
@entity5 , on the other hand , created only for himself in the opening 45 , although this was enough to strike fear into the @entity139 defence			0
he rectified that soon after half time , a perfectly weighted pass playing in @entity141 , who should really have made it 2 - 0 , and then releasing @entity114 inside the box , who again was wasteful			1
@entity14 : 6/10 neymar 6/10 @entity146 and @entity8 's defence managed to keep @entity14 relatively quiet for a clean sheet on saturday individual brilliance while @entity8 's new counter-attacking system relies on @entity5 to do it all himself , @entity9 's tactical set - up lets @entity14 drift in and out , before attacking from deeper areas			1
both systems are designed to get the best out of their major star , and both seemed to work fairly well in that respect			0
@entity14 repeatedly picked up the ball from the right hand side and drove at the @entity161 defence , who usually responded by fouling him			0
mostly the @entity139 beat at least one man , before spreading the play wide or winning a free kick in a dangerous area			0
the levels of excitement were certainly raised around the stadium when he got on the ball , but there were hints , rather than devastating examples , of what he can do on the ball			0
@entity8 's talisman @entity5 was on the receiving end of several heavy tackles from the @entity9 back line as the need to take the game by the scruff of the neck increased with @entity8 's two goals , @entity14 came further inside and began to run with the ball more			1
two shots soon after the hour mark tested @entity184 , though neither really threatened to find the back of the net			0
@entity5 , on the other hand , clearly had the upper hand in this particular duel			0
out of the game for such long periods , the @entity8 captain showed several times what he could do when given time and space			0
soon after the half hour @entity5 went on three devastating dribbles in five short minutes , slicing through the @entity9 defence with ease and very nearly taking the game away from his opponents single - handedly			1
@entity14 : 6/10 neymar 9/10 @entity202 fails to halt another marauding run by @entity5 , who showed plenty of creativity in @entity106 @entity207 for all their tricks and flicks , runs and rabonas , the pair will always be judged on their final touch			1
in the first half , both were found seriously wanting			0
@entity14 , usually so deadly , fired two free kicks against the wall and failed to manufacture any shooting opportunities from open play			0
even when presented with the perfect opportunity from 12 yards the @entity221 could only fire his spot - kick tamely at @entity184			0
the second half saw three decent efforts from the edge of the box , all of which brought saves from @entity184 , but only an 80th minute free - kick looked close to beating the @entity8 keeper			2
his best run , during which he ran from half - way , beating two men before drawing the keeper , ended with something of a whimper , a scuffed shot that trickled wide			0
then , early in the second half , the pacey @entity161 eased past the defence only to cut the ball back to no - one			0
even when put through one - on - one by @entity242 against a goalkeeper stuck in no - mans - land , the young forward could only chip over the bar			0
@entity14 : 5/10 neymar 5/10 @entity14 was surprisingly out of sorts for his national side , having a penalty saved as @entity8 won 2 - 0 in @entity24 @entity5 runs away to celebrate @entity8 's second goal as the @entity16 striker put in an influential display @entity252 neither of these players is particularly noted for their work without the ball , but football is a team game , and no side can afford to carry a man , however talented , completely			1
@entity14 has , this season , returned to his pressing game at @entity16 , and appeared keen to keep it up on saturday			2
no longer did we see the @entity139 standing still or wandering around after losing the ball - @entity14 worked hard to win it back , and pressure defenders into mistakes			2
in truth , the success of this was limited , but it was important for @entity274 's gameplan that his talisman made an effort when out of possession			0
@entity5 , on the other hand , was required to do almost nothing defensively , lurking up - field while his team - mates won the ball back			1
this left @entity125 free to attack down the right unchecked , and could have been costly if @entity9 's forwards had been on their game			2
@entity14 : 5/10 neymar 4/10 the @entity8 squad celebrate together after @entity25 doubled his total during the 2 - 0 win in @entity24 total @entity14 started the brighter , but after @entity8 took the lead and space opened up for @entity5 it was the younger man that stole the show			1
@entity14 was the focal point for an @entity9 side that , for all their possession , created few clear - cut chances , while @entity5 typified the counter-attacking spirit that @entity72 is trying to instill			1
neither man was quite at their brilliant best , but @entity5 upstaged his more experienced club - mate			1
