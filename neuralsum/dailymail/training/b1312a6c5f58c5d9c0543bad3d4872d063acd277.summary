@entity0 has left @entity1 for @entity2 in a £ 75million deal and the rest of the country will bid ' @entity6 '			1
branded a biting , racist cheat , the shamed striker 's admittance of guilt over biting @entity13 's @entity12 was the final insult for a proud club that lent him so much support			2
@entity1 have taken the decision to sell as they could no longer countenance the tarnishing of their image			1
defending @entity0 had arguably already cost previous manager @entity40 his job and @entity42 spoke sympathetically of how @entity0 was a reformed character who had learned from his mistakes			0
declared @entity46 football 's player of the year , @entity0 professed his love for @entity1 , shed public tears when they let the @entity50 title slip through their grasp and still spoke of his desire to stay			1
barely 50 days later , many of the club 's fans are questioning whether his fiendish actions in @entity57 have all been part of a calculated , manipulative plan to escape to @entity60			0
his bite on @entity64 's @entity63 in 2010 preceded a move from @entity66 , his bite on @entity38 precipitated @entity68 's interest and now @entity12 has seemingly served his purpose			0
@entity0 's apology , for sinking his teeth into the @entity73 's shoulder and gaining a four month suspension , has been praised by @entity76 president @entity75 and a @entity2 hierarchy desperate to be vindicated in their choice of signing			1
first bite : @entity0 was caught biting @entity64 's @entity82 while he was playing for @entity66 waving goodbye : @entity0 did so much to rectify his reputation in @entity84 , but it is now back in the gutter @entity92 footballer though he is , the boy who rose from the @entity89 street gutter of @entity90 has returned to the gutter in many people 's eyes			1
@entity84 captain @entity96 hailed @entity0 as the best player he has ever played with			1
for all his wonderful skill and spectacular goals though , his behaviour means he can not be compared to the pantheon of great foreign talent to have graced the @entity50			0
do not forget his talk of retribution following his dismantling of @entity84 's @entity106 hopes in @entity90 's 2 - 1 win ; criticising how this country has treated him			2
' before the game , too many people in @entity84 laughed about my attitude over the last few years , ' he said			2
' this is a very good time for me			0
i want to see what they think now			0
' not much @entity0 and even less once you took a liking to @entity12 's tenderised shoulder			2
feted as an idol , this man 's actions have been borderline grotesque and now his wishes have been granted with a move to @entity2			0
you 're welcome to him			0
@entity125 appeal rejected another bite : @entity0 picked up his latest ban after biting @entity12 the @entity106 you 're welcome to him : @entity0 will be the new no 9 at @entity2 , to be presented next week			1

@entity0 £ 75million *transfer* to @entity2 *completed* on *friday*
@entity132 facing ban after biting @entity12 in @entity106 game
many *controversial* *incidents* in @entity84 , including racism , cheating and more biting
@entity1 should be glad they *'ve* got rid of a player who was tarnishing their image
