by @entity0 published : 03:02 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:38 est , 6 february 2014 builder @entity3 spent five years building his dream home – but only five hours demolishing it with a @entity8 to prevent a former lover winning a bitter money wrangle			1
mr @entity3 said flattening the imposing six - bedroom house on a remote @entity13 isle was preferable to seeing his former partner @entity15 profit from his hard work			1
three - times married mr @entity3 , 66 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , took the bizarre revenge after miss @entity15 launched legal action to repossess the property and evict him over his failure to repay a six - figure loan after their relationship broke down			1
from this : builder @entity3 's imposing six - bedroom house as it once stood , on a remote @entity13 isle to this : mr @entity3 said flattening the house was preferable to seeing his ex-partner profit from his hard work the great - grandfather decided to demolish the three - storey home , which has beautiful views over @entity37 , after his ex refused to allow him time to sell the property for more money in a public auction			1
when miss @entity15 called in lawyers to recover her six - figure investment , a crushed mr @entity3 decided to flatten the house with the digger rather than hand it over			1
last night , he said : ‘ i built the house to last forever and i had spent five years putting it up and strengthening it			1
i was upset [ knocking it down ] but i felt i was losing it anyway and i did n’t like being dictated to in that way			0
‘ it is sad my dream has ended this way			2
i wish to @entity55 i had never met @entity15			1
but there ’s no point wasting emotion worrying over things that have happened			0
’ mr @entity3 , originally from @entity60 , @entity61 , moved to @entity18 with his then wife , @entity62 , in 2001 after falling in love with the island on a holiday			1
they bought land and a one - bedroom cottage called @entity69 , complete with private beach			1
they built another house with six bedrooms – intending to turn it into a family home plus @entity76 , but their marriage fell apart before it was finished and mr @entity3 faced losing the property in a divorce settlement			1
in 2010 , he met divorcee miss @entity15 on online dating site @entity81 and she agreed to loan him her life savings so he could pay off his wife and keep the property			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ @entity15 offered to lend me the money to pay @entity62 off and just speed up the divorce , so we could sell the house at our own speed			1
the idea was to sell it and move on with our new life together , @entity93 and i. ’ he said he borrowed £ 202,000 from miss @entity15 , secured against the cottage , the house and a small plot of land – together valued at a conservative £ 310,000			1
the subsequent sale of a hangar - style shed netted £ 50,000 which he paid to miss @entity15 , cutting his debt , including interest , to £ 170,000			1
however , things started to go wrong with their relationship during a holiday to @entity107 a year ago			0
conflict : when @entity15 ( right ) called in lawyers to recover her six - figure investment , a crushed @entity3 ( right ) decided to flatten the house with the digger rather than hand it over he said : ‘ we went to @entity107 for three months in february because @entity15 fancied buying a property and wanted to see what she could get , but we separated while we were there and she came home three weeks early			1
‘ we talked about our financial agreement and she said she would give me two months to sell the properties and if i could n’t manage it , they would go to public auction with a reserve of £ 170,000 for all three properties , enough to cover the remainder of her loan			2
‘ but three days later , i got an email from her solicitor in @entity127 saying they were starting repossession proceedings			0
’ mr @entity3 added : ‘ i was upset about the way things went			1
it was not done out of rage ; possibly hurt pride			0
that night , i knew i was going to lose the property			0
' it is sad my dream has ended this way			2
i wish to @entity55 i had never met @entity15			1
but there ’s no point wasting emotion worrying over things that have happened ' @entity3 ‘ @entity15 said she had an offer for £ 170,000 from someone on @entity19 looking to buy all three properties for just the £ 170,000 she was owed			1
‘ so basically , it felt they would all have been laughing at me behind my back			0
she had me by the short and curlies and i felt backed into a corner			0
‘ the proper way to have dealt with it would have been to put it to public auction			0
she would have got her money and i would have received some money too but @entity15 would n’t let me do that			1
‘ it seemed very unfair			0
i decided that flattening the house was one way to do something about it			2
’ it took the former building contractor only five hours to reduce the property to rubble last august			2
he went on : ‘ i demolished the house at night , starting at midnight and finishing at five o’clock in the morning			2
there was no going back from that			0
i ’m facing bankruptcy shortly			0
‘ i had actually emptied the furniture and everything out of the cottage and was going to demolish the cottage as well , but at the last minute as i drove the machine up to the front door i thought , ‘ no , that ’s completely wrong ’			0
choice : the great - grandfather decided to demolish the three - storey home , which has beautiful views over @entity37 , after his ex refused to allow him time to sell the property for more money in a public auction ‘ i did n’t want to ruin @entity93 or take all her savings , i just wanted to let her know she could n’t do what she was doing without having to pay a price			1
‘ she would still have the £ 95,000 that the cottage was worth and the £ 20,000 from the land and she would have the remains of the house and the two acres of land that comes with it			2
‘ the infrastructure is still there and all the services are in , so it would be a house you could sell for £ 50,000			2
so she would get most of her money back			2
’ police were called in but as mr @entity3 was the sole name on the deeds for the property , miss @entity15 was informed it was not being treated as a criminal matter			1
last night , miss @entity15 declined to comment at her home in @entity207			1
a close friend said : ‘ she felt sorry for him			0
she ’s no mug – lawyers got involved and contracts were drawn up			0
she thought nothing could go wrong			0
’ ' she 's no mug – lawyers got involved and contracts were drawn up			2
she thought nothing could go wrong			0
both of them have lost out because of his stupidity ' friend of @entity15 the friend added : ‘ he just drove the @entity8 right through the middle of the house			1
all the time , money and effort that had gone into it was wrecked out of spite			2
my friend felt sick when she was told			0
‘ she does n’t expect to see a penny from that man			0
both of them have lost out because of his stupidity			0
’ mr @entity3 , who moved into the cottage until november when it was repossessed , now lives in rented accommodation in @entity236 and uses a caravan stored inside a friend ’s hangar when he is on @entity18			2
he thinks he will have to go back to work to supplement his state pension , his only form of income , adding : ‘ i ’m in a bad financial situation now			0
’ reflecting on his demolition job , he said : ‘ it is quite extreme and i have never done anything like that before			0
if she had just stuck to our original agreement , all of this could have been avoided			0
’ @entity19 confirmed officials were called out to the property after concerns were raised that it had been flattened without a warrant for demolition			2
@entity260 , head of planning at @entity19 , said : ‘ building standards and planning enforcement officers visited @entity69 , @entity18 , last year to follow up on concerns about the site			1
we are not pursuing further action			0
’ police said that they were aware of an ‘ ongoing civil matter ’ on the island .			0
