@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , told @entity10 that he came up with the idea to reenact the photo of his son @entity13 , 20 , and a female friend after reading an article about parents copying their kids ' selfies			1

after getting the approval of his son , mr @entity7 posted the side - by - side photos on @entity52 , where they were quickly picked up by @entity53 and garnered more than two million views			1
' i told him i should do this and he said , " i do n't know who would be more embarrassed - you or me			1
