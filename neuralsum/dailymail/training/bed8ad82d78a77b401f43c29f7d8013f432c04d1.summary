the police union paid a pr firm for advice on using ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ against ministers just weeks before the @entity5 scandal			1
the media strategy also called for a military - style ‘ blitzkrieg ’ to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers			1
the secret plot was laid down in a £ 10,000 - a - month contract handed to the public relations company by the @entity16			1
the revelation will worsen relations between the union ’s officials and the @entity21 , which believes @entity22 was ‘ stitched up ’ in the september 2012 @entity5 affair			1
the revelation about the @entity16 's @entity1 ' guerrilla ' campaign will worsen relations between the union 's officials and the @entity21 , which believes @entity22 was ' stitched up ' in the september 2012 @entity5 affair			1
the media campaign was a response to home secretary @entity31 ’s hardline approach the former chief whip has always denied calling @entity34 police officers ‘ * * * * ing plebs ’ , insisting the row was hijacked by @entity16 officials for political ends			1
representing 125,000 rank and file officers , the union was furious at home secretary @entity31 ’s hardline approach to the reforms			2
and , just months before @entity5 , @entity16 bosses signed up for the services of @entity46 , who is a former newspaper columnist and radio dj , and his brother @entity48			1
the contract stated mr @entity46 ’s firm would be paid £ 10,000 a month to undertake a campaign using ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ and ‘ blitzkrieg ’ against government police pay reform			1
the deal lasted only two months but mr @entity46 continued to provide pr advice to three branches of the federation in the @entity60 , all central to the ‘ @entity5 ’ storm			2
just months before @entity5 , federation bosses signed up mr @entity46 's firm for £ 10,000 a month to undertake a campaign using ' guerrilla tactics ' and ' blitzkrieg ' against government police pay reform three delegates from @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 met mr @entity22 at his @entity72 constituency office near @entity73			1
afterwards they claimed he refused to provide an account of the incident – their tough stance adding to pressure that later saw him quit the government			0
mr @entity46 went to the meeting with the three officers , who were later heavily criticised by the @entity84 home affairs committee			0
their federations had previously mocked the government and the chief whip by printing ' @entity90 ' t - shirts			0
@entity91 have claimed mr @entity46 leaked details of the private meeting to the media			0
and a secret recording made by mr @entity22 showed he had apologised for swearing at the @entity34 officers and denied using the word ‘ plebs ’			2
last year , national @entity16 officials discussed whether a copy of the ‘ guerrilla tactics ’ contract should be sent to the home affairs committee , which was investigating @entity5			1
a row erupted when the decision was made not to do so			0
today , a whistleblower , who claims she was unfairly dismissed after raising concerns about the @entity16 , is expected to be questioned about the agreement by the @entity110			2
@entity111 has spoken of a ‘ vocal minority ’ who resisted her efforts which were , she claims , ‘ undertaken in good faith and with encouragement , mostly in the absence of any strategy , guidelines , policy or support ’			0
miss @entity111 ’s testimony comes after a key witness to @entity5 claimed the @entity16 exploited the affair			1
in february , @entity125 , one of the four police officers on duty at the time , said he believed mr @entity22 called the officers ‘ * * * * ing plebs ’ as claimed in the original police log			1
but the former officer added that although mr @entity22 ’s behaviour was officious and rude , he did not deserve to lose his job in government over a ‘ quirky incident ’			2
he condemned the @entity16 for stirring up the case against the politician , who he felt was treated ‘ like tethered prey ’ in the days before he was forced to resign			2
the former chief whip has always denied calling @entity34 police officers ' * * * * ing plebs ' , insisting the row was hijacked by @entity16 officials for political ends			1
pictured , a still from @entity147 footage capturing the alleged incident a secret recording made by mr @entity22 showed he had apologised for swearing at the @entity34 officers and denied using the word ' plebs ' he also said the officers at the gate were undermined by colleagues in the @entity156 ’s diplomatic protection group who leaked the log of the incident and by the actions of pc @entity161 , who has been jailed for 12 months for lying about witnessing the incident			0
last night the @entity16 refused to answer questions about its media contract with @entity166			2
a spokesman told the @entity168 : ‘ in 2012 , the @entity16 contracted @entity166 to assist with a communications campaign around the likely effect on public safety of government budget cuts to policing			0
‘ the contract was terminated after two months and the company has not been used by the @entity176 since			0
‘ the @entity178 are aware that the @entity16 used @entity179			0
owing to commercial sensitivity , it would be inappropriate to discuss the details of the contract			0
’ former @entity183 columnist mr @entity46 , 53 , the son of a police officer who has been hailed as ‘ the monster who roars for coppers ’ on the website of the @entity189 , also refused to discuss the contract			0
he said : ‘ i had a contract with them but obviously it ’s confidential			0
there was a confidentiality clause			0
