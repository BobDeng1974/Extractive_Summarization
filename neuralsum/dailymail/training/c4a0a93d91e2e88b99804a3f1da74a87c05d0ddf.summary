despite it being perceived as posh , the @entity1 's @entity0 has been named @entity4 's favourite accent it is the unmistakable sound of the queen and old @entity8 newsreels			1
and despite being perceived as a little posh , received pronunciation ( @entity11 ) is still our favourite accent			1
for a survey has found that the @entity1 's @entity0 is most associated with nine out of ten positive character traits , including attractiveness , intelligence , honesty , charm , sophistication and reliability			1
the only category where it falls short is in humour where it came only eleventh with the @entity27 lilt sounding most fun ahead of @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
the @entity34 experiment involving 750 participants listening to sound clips of men and women with 19 different international and regional accents and scoring what they believed of the person based on 10 character traits			0
the poll also identified a phenomenon dubbed the ' @entity46 factor ' where celebrities shape our preconceptions about accents			1
despite the reputation of @entity53 and @entity54 men , @entity11 is the real language of love - as well as many other things			0
@entity58 came second overall ahead of @entity59 , southern @entity30 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
they were followed by @entity27 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2
@entity53 was ranked only 16th for attractiveness and @entity54 came in only slightly higher at 13th			0
@entity53 performed better in the ' romantic ' category but was still only placed third behind @entity11 and @entity58			2
more than one - in - five ( 22 per cent ) admitted the allure of some accents is so strong they have actually gone on a date because of it - and seven percent have ' played up ' how they speak because they believed it sounded attractive			0
professor @entity76 , a phoneticist at @entity78 , said : ' @entity11 speakers have been rated highly in terms of intelligence - and the accent itself as attractive - since studies like this began			2
' actors with this accent - like @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , @entity89 ( @entity90 ) and @entity91 ( @entity92 ) - come over as urbane , charming , witty and educated and - well - would n't everyone want that from a prospective romantic partner ? ' the @entity58 accent is also associated with culture and intelligence - think @entity97 or @entity99 and you 're already swept off your feet			1
the @entity58 accent , widely associated with actor @entity97 , is considered romantic and charming the poll also identified a phenomenon dubbed the ' @entity46 factor ' , in which celebrities shape our preconceptions about accents ' however , comedians are rarely @entity11 speakers and so it is no surprise to see it rated less highly in that respect ; @entity118 ( @entity27 ) and @entity119 ( @entity117 ) spring to mind as wonderfully funny , articulate people			1
' our preconceptions and love of certain lilts , drawls and tones when it comes to accents is mostly down to experience and stereotyping			2
received pronunciation ( @entity11 ) 2			1
@entity30 ( @entity130 ) 5			0
welsh ' this helps to explain why @entity11 scores so highly across all categories - it 's the accent we associate with trusted newsreaders plus it continues to be used as the model for teaching @entity0 as a foreign language			2
' in terms of other accents which were rated highly for attractiveness - again stereotyping is at play			0
across the pond we see @entity61 as colourful and international so they 're ' interesting ' , @entity60 folk are seen as down to earth and honest and the @entity30 have ' kissed the @entity151 ' and are celebrated as charming and quick witted			0
' in terms of @entity53 and @entity54 not faring so well this could simply be down to a lack of familiarity with their unique inflections			0
' @entity159 , spokesperson for @entity34 , said : ' after spending time getting to know each other online the first time you meet and say ' hello ' on a date is a special , exciting moment			0
' yet while accents may be appealing at first - sparking initial interest and attraction - happy long - term relationships are about far more than that			0
