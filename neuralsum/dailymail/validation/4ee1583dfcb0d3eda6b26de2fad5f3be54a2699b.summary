two - thirds of the laws passed by @entity3 ’s parliament over the past 22 years have either been made or influenced by the @entity4 , according to a study			1
an analysis of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 found that 64.7 per cent carried the fingerprints of @entity9			1
the study , by the @entity11 campaign group @entity10 , found that 59.3 per cent of the total are regulations – binding @entity4 laws which must be accepted by member states without modification			1
some 49,699 have been enacted			0
some 4,283 have been implemented by the @entity3 parliament			0
the study found that the largest number of @entity4 - influenced directives passed into @entity3 law was in 2009 when 294 were brought in			1
there were 171 last year			0
of the major pieces of legislation in 2013 , 35 out of 78 were implementing @entity4 directives			0
the findings will fuel debate about @entity38 ’s plans to renegotiate @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity4 if he wins a second term , ahead of his promised in - out referendum before the end of 2017			1
in his landmark speech on @entity45 two years ago in which he offered the referendum , the prime minister said people rightly questioned whether ‘ the balance was right ’ in terms of @entity4 legislation			0
@entity51 , chief executive of @entity52 , said : ‘ @entity38 has rightly pointed out that bureaucratic @entity4 rules unnecessarily affect our daily lives far too often			2
‘ the @entity56 and @entity57 almost always see regulation as the answer to every problem the @entity4 faces , regardless of the impact on business and our economic competitiveness			0
access to the single market should not come at the cost of having two - thirds of our laws being decided by the @entity4			2
‘ there must be a significant reduction in the amount and scope of @entity4 legislation and powers over certain policy areas should be given back to @entity57 so decisions are made far closer to the @entity3 people			1
’ business for @entity3 , which is backed by business leaders who want to see @entity3 either leave the @entity4 or have a fundamentally different relationship with it , says it acknowledges that regulations and directives are needed for the single market to work effectively			2
the campaign group ’s figure is far higher than an estimate from the @entity89 , which put it at 13.3 per cent			0
business for @entity3 said the explanation for the difference was the fact that many @entity4 regulations simply pass into @entity3 law , without ever being voted on by @entity96			2
last year , @entity98 leader @entity97 and @entity100 leader @entity99 held two televised debates about @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity4 last year @entity98 leader @entity97 and @entity100 leader @entity99 held two televised debates about @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity4 in which mr @entity97 claimed only 7 per cent of our laws are made in @entity9 , while mr @entity99 insisted it was up to 75 per cent			1
pro-europeans said the campaign group ’s report was ‘ misleading ’			0
@entity109 , chairman of @entity110 , said : ‘ it is wrong to imply that all laws originating at @entity4 - level are undemocratic or over-burdensome			0
‘ the @entity3 gets a seat at the negotiating table and most of the time , one @entity4 law gets rid of 28 different national laws across @entity45 , making it much simpler and easier for businesses to export			1

study found 64.7 per cent of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 have either been made or influenced by the @entity4
more than half were binding @entity4 laws which must be accepted by member states without modification
findings will fuel debate about @entity38 ’s plans to renegotiate @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity4
