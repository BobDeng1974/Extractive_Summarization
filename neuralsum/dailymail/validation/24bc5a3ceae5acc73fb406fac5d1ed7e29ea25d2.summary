@entity0 and her partner @entity1 forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture an evil mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute , a high court judge ruled yesterday			1
@entity0 and her partner @entity1 forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in @entity16 , @entity17 , mrs justice @entity18 said			1
she named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was ‘ evil ’ and ‘ baseless ’			1
the judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters , aged eight and nine , cannabis soup to gain their compliance			1
more than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘ fantasy ’ online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of @entity36 where the ‘ main action ’ was alleged to have happened , the ruling said			1
the ‘ grotesque ’ claims against ‘ blameless ’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as @entity42 and @entity43 to @entity17 and then sacrificed			2
cult members were said to have drunk their victims ’ blood and danced around with the babies ’ skulls			0
at least seven other schools were named , a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘ rituals ’ were alleged to have been performed at a @entity54 ’s fast food restaurant			2
the children ’s father @entity55 , whose three - year relationship with @entity0 ended acrimoniously in 2006 , was falsely said to be the leader of the cult , and teachers , police and a priest to be among its more than 100 members			0
the judge said : ‘ many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers , home and email addresses have been published			2
‘ several of those implicated have received malicious , intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world			0
for example – “ we ’re coming for you			0
’ the two children , who are now in care , were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet ‘ with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests ’			1
mrs @entity18 was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by @entity95 council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult ’s abuse			1
but the judge said they were in fact forced by @entity0 and @entity102 to ‘ provide concocted accounts of horrific events ’ in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in september last year			1
the children ’s stories came about as the result of ‘ relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse ’			2
internet campaign : more than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘ fantasy ’ online material ‘ torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by @entity102 in collaboration with @entity0 , ’ the judge said			1
‘ both p and @entity126 have suffered significantly			0
their grip on reality was imperilled			0
’ tests showed they had both also ingested cannabis in the three months before being taken into care			0
it was impossible for analysts to say if this was via passive smoking or oral ingestion , but both children had described in interview how hemp was made into soup at their home using the juicer , the judge said			0
@entity0 took no part in the court proceedings and has ‘ not been seen by anyone in authority since february 12 ’			2
there are ‘ rumours that she has fled abroad ’ because she fears being arrested , mrs justice @entity18 said			2
the judge completely cleared mr @entity55 and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet ‘ nothing more than utter nonsense ’			1
‘ i am entirely certain that everything ms @entity0 , her partner @entity1 and the children said about those matters was fabricated , ’ she said			1
‘ the claims are baseless			0
those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish			0
‘ all the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people			0
‘ it ’s akin to the sensation , i imagine , of a @entity178 user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been liked			0
