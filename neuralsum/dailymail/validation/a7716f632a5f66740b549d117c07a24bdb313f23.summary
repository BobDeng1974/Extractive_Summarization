at 100 - plus kilometres per hour , @entity1 's car goes into a sideways slide that has it teetering on the brink of flipping over into an uncontrolled roll			1
no problem for ms @entity1			1
she adjusts the steering wheel , shift 's down a gear , and slams her foot on the accelerator to power out of the turn			2
meet the young @entity15 driver who is smashing through the glass ceiling of motorsports			1
not literally , of course			2
@entity15 @entity1 is the only woman competing in the @entity19 motorsports has always traditionally been a macho industry , but two women are breaking through the glass ceiling with fearless grit and determination ms @entity1 , 26 , is the only woman competing on the @entity19 circuit - a competition in which 19 drivers have been killed since it began in the earlier 1970s			1
she has joined @entity31 @entity30 , the only female @entity32 test driver in the world , as women at the top of their chosen sports , both traditionally dominate by men			1
both women were born with racing pumping through their veins - their parents worked in the motorsports arena			2
although it was n't expected that they follow in their footsteps - they were certainly never discouraged to take up the male - dominated sport because they were female			1
@entity30 , who now lives in @entity47 , is the only female @entity49 test driver in the world @entity30 poses with fans before the first practice session at the @entity32 @entity15 @entity53 in @entity54 the 32 - year - old ( right ) grew up in the rugged highlands on the west coast of @entity58 and rode her first motorbike at the wee age of just two years old born and bred in @entity61 , both ms @entity1 's parents were competitors in rally car driving but it was her mother who had the most prominent career as a co-driver for @entity68			1
' as we were growing up she was the high profile person , even more than my father , so i did n't think that was weird , ' she said			2
' @entity74 was at home making our lunches for school while my mum was competing around the country , so i did n't really think that was anything abnormal - i just thought everyone 's mums did that			2
' so if you have that mindset from the start and then find what you love doing that 's what you base it on and everything else happens around you			0
' ms @entity1 's first taste of being behind the wheel of a rally car was when she was learning to drive and her parents tested out her skills purely for safety purposes			1
@entity1 , 26 , ( left ) and @entity30 , 32			1
( right ) have accelerated to the top of their respective motorsports and do n't plan on taking the foot of the pedal anytime soon what a rush : born and bred in @entity61 , both of ms @entity1 's parents were competitors in rally car driving but it was her mother who had the most prominent career ' i could n't believe the adrenalin rush and how much fun it was , ' she said			1
' when you start to enjoy something you get competitive , and when you get competitive you want to win , and then once you win in that category you want to move up - and then you 're hooked			0
' @entity118 was given exclusive access to ms @entity1 and ms @entity30 in the lead up to the @entity15 @entity53 in @entity54 - including a heart - stopping ride in the navigator 's seat of ms @entity1 's rally car			1
the most impressive thing to witness was ms @entity1 's unflinching concentration and precisely honed skills , even with the car racing around the track at high speed , with dust flying and the engine screaming			1
hundreds of thousands of hard - core rev heads gearing up for the @entity53 in @entity54 this weekend endearingly unassuming about their success , these two know that they have excelled in their fields because they have worked hard - and not because they are just the token females in a man 's world @entity30 , who now lives in @entity47 with her husband who heads the @entity49 team , started her love for all things fast not long before she could walk			1
the 32 - year - old grew up in the rugged highlands on the west coast of @entity58 and rode her first motorbike at the wee age of just two years old			0
' my brother is only 18 months older so i was always of the belief that i could do anything he could do , ' she said			0
her father owned a motorbike shop and he met his wife - to - be when she walked into buy a set of wheels			0
@entity1 's ( right ) first taste of being behind the wheel of a rally car was when she was learning to drive and her parents tested out her skills purely for safety purposes ' when you start to enjoy something you get competitive , and when you get competitive you want to win , and then once you win in that category you want to move up - and then you 're hooked , ' the 26 - year - old ( right ) said now she 's a test driver for @entity175 team and the only woman on the @entity32 circuit			1
ms @entity30 said her parents never pressured her into following any particular - her brother , for example , became a film maker			1
' i have so much respect for my parents that they allowed us to chase our dreams because we both dropped out of uni to follow our own path and i 'll always be thankful for that , ' she said			0
' there is so much pressure to go along that standard path of go to university and get a job			0
' @entity1 's parents had a similar attitude when their children were growing up			1
' my parents would have been exactly the same if i wanted to be a rally driver or a pilot ' she said			2
' they were just always supportive of whatever my passion was - which happened to be the same as them			0
' it is believed many more women will climb the motorsport ladder over the years until it eventually becomes the norm both women have no doubt that being born with that competitive streak and instilled with a great determination and belief that they can do whatever they put their minds to has helped get them to where they are today			0
a sense of fearlessness is also very important as both women insist you ca n't allow that emotion to enter your head if you want to succeed			0
@entity1 has only ever come away with a few scratches and bruises despite facing tough terrain for up to an entire day			1
' the car gets hurt more than me - and my wallet hurts too , ' @entity1 said			1
' the moment you are scared you are not thinking about the job			0
' @entity30 echoed those words saying you ca n't afford to have fear when you are in control of the car			1
' i respect that cars go fast and can be dangerous but if you get scared , it 's time to stop because you are not concentrating , ' she said			0
both women have no doubt that being born with that competitive streak and instilled with a great determination and belief that they can do whatever they put their minds to has helped get them to where they are today endearingly unassuming about their success , they know that they have excelled in their fields because they have worked hard - and not because they are just the token females in a man 's world			0
@entity1 said she has only ever been supported in her career over the past decade			1
' i think when i started i was just focused on what i wanted to do and if you come across and act professional and serious about what you do then there 's no resistance and you get the same respect back and then you 're treated as just one of the boys , ' she said			0
@entity30 believes that they are in their roles because they are simply the best people for the job			2
' @entity175 is a very performance - based environment on and off the track , ' she said			0
however , she admits the attention that females attract in the sport is a double - edged sword because the more the word gets out there , the more young girls will be inspired to jump on board			0
' it 's good that it has been brought across in a positive way but i 'm not in racing to prove a point - i 'm in racing because i found my passion and i love it			0
' they have watched the industry evolve over time and believe many more women will climb the motorsport ladder over the years until it eventually becomes the norm			0
@entity30 said it takes generations to see that kind of change but it is happening			2
' there are no clear role models - the little girls watching @entity32 do n't see many women so there are not enough girls starting at a young age , she said			2
' but i see it changing a lot in f1 - nobody came and said we need more women - the women just came in to do the best possible job , ' she said			0
' now there 's a lot more women in the paddock which means they were the best for the job			0
' @entity1 is also seeing a significant shift in rally car driving			2
' it 's certainly something that 's changing because it such a difficult sport - you have so many people that start out at the grassroots level and then that filters out as you get higher in the levels - so it 's just a matter of time before we see more women progressing all the way up , ' she said .			0
