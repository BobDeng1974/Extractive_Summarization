by @entity1 reporter published : 10:11 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 10:12 est , 31 august 2012 a teenager has baffled doctors with an infection never recorded before in medical history			2
@entity6 , 16 , from @entity7 , has lived with a brain tumour for eight years but is now recovering from a rare medical first			1
after six operations and contracting meningitis , doctors discovered a fungal infection , called aspergillis , had spread from his stomach , up the shunt and into his brain - something which has never been recorded before			1
doctors at @entity18 controlled the infection just in time and @entity6 finally returned home this month			1
@entity6 has a brain tumour , which doctors have shrunk using radiotherapy			1
pictured with his mother @entity24 and father @entity25 he still has the aspergillis infection but it is now being controlled , although he has no idea how it will affect him in the future			2
in 2004 , @entity6 was rushed to hospital after suffering a seizure in @entity32 while on holiday with his parents , @entity25 and @entity24 , and an mri scan revealed he had a large tumour in the back of his head			1
it had caused a fluid build - up in his brain , which had been causing dizziness for nearly a year , so @entity32 surgeons fitted a shunt to release the fluid into his stomach			0
since then , he has had radiotherapy in @entity48 to shrink the tumour and four more shunts fitted in the @entity51 , but six months ago his stomach became bloated , so his parents took him back to @entity48			1
after draining the fluid , doctors discovered aspergillis on the shunt fitted in @entity32 , so he underwent a second operation , this time lasting four hours , to remove it			0
@entity6 still faces a battle with his health but is glad to be back at home @entity6 continued to suffer with the infection , despite drips pumping his body with antibiotics and antifungicides all day long for weeks			1
doctors operated again to remove another shunt and install one on the outside of his head , which released fluid into a bag			0
unfortunately , a stitch burst and he contracted meningitis through the wound			0
doctors upped the dose of antibiotics to fight the disease as , by this point , @entity6 's immune system was almost totally inactive			1
@entity6 then had another operation to remove the exterior shunt and fit another on the other side of his head , yet nothing seemed to be working and doctors were baffled			1
they contacted neurosurgeons worldwide , but none identified the problem			0
a cloudy area on a brain scan revealed that aspergillis had spread from his stomach , up the shunt and into his brain something that had never been recorded in history			1
he said : ' i am just so glad to be back coming home is all i have thought about since going to hospital			2
' father @entity25 , 44 , said : ' there were a couple of times when we thought we might lose him			0
' the doctors were trying to save his life but he spent so long on antibiotics that his immune system was shot , which made many treatments impossible			0
' no one has ever had this kind of infection on the brain before so we have no idea what will happen we are totally blind			2
' we are just enjoying having him home and think it is amazing how well he is doing			0
' mother @entity24 , 51 , said : ' he has been incredibly brave throughout			0
no matter what happened , he never grumbled and has kept us laughing every day			0
i am so glad to have him home			2

@entity6 , 16 , has battled a brain tumour , meningitis and a fungal infection that spread to his brain
we *'re* so glad to have him home , say his parents
