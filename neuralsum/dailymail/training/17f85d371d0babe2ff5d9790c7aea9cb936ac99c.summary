patients could one day ' grow ' new organs from their own stem cells to replace failing body parts , a leading transplant surgeon says			1
it could offer a solution to the donor shortage crisis in the @entity8 , which will only get worse as the population ages			1
professor @entity10 after performing the pioneering surgery at the @entity12 of @entity13 in 2008 at least 1,000 @entity8 die each year while waiting for a new heart , kidney or liver , while others are forced to pay for black market organs bought in other countries			1
professor @entity10 who performed the first transplant of an organ grown from the patient 's own cells in 2008 , said scientists were now on the verge of using regenerative medicine to treat a far wider range of conditions			2
the pioneering technique involves inserting a patient 's own stem cells into an artificial scaffold			2
it requires no human donors and as there are no problems with organ rejection patients will not need to spend a lifetime taking immuno - suppressive drugs			2
explaining @entity42 's treatment writing in @entity43 , prof @entity10 from the @entity44 in @entity45 , said : ' such an approach has already been used successfully for the repair and reconstruction of several complex tissues such as the trachea , oesophagus , and skeletal muscle in animal models and human beings			2
' guided by appropriate scientific and ethical oversight , ( this ) could serve as a platform for the engineering of whole organs and other tissues , and might become a viable and practical future therapeutic approach to meet demand after organ failure			0
' prof @entity10 said patients involved in early clinical trials should only be chosen if they have social support and are willing to cope with media interest			0
in 2008 , 30 - year - old @entity42 hit the headlines after becoming the first person in the world to have a trachea transplant grown from her own cells			1
she had contracted @entity73 which had damaged her windpipe leaving her breathless			0
prof @entity10 , leading a team from @entity76 , stripped a donor trachea of its living cells and reseeded it with @entity42 's cells before transplanting it			0
@entity42 was the first recipient of an airway grown using her own cells in 2010 , he led a @entity8 team at @entity84 to perform a similar operation on a 10 - year - old boy born with a narrow windpipe			1
the trachea is a simple organ compared to a pair of lungs or the heart , however lung tissue has already been developed and transplant into mice			1
however , prof @entity10 said more needs to be done to address ethical questions raised by the new technology before it goes any further			0
' the pressure to advance this technique , driven by demand , the race for prestige , and the potential for huge profits , mandates an early commitment be made to establish the safety of various strategies â€¦ particularly when there are so many potential patients and doctors who are desperate for any remedy that offers hope , ' he said			0
he called for policies to address issues including transparency about the techniques involved and costs to patients .			0
