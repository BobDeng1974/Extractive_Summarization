the @entity1 parents of an unborn child with two faces and two brains are defying doctors ' advice to terminate the pregnancy			0
@entity8 and @entity9 , of @entity10 in @entity12 's west , say they were shocked when an ultrasound revealed the twins they were expecting were in fact only one child , but with two perfectly symmetrical faces and two brains connected to the one brain stem			1
three - dimensional scans show the child has two legs , two arms and one body and all its vital organs , including a strong beating heart			0
but while doctors told ms @entity8 she should not keep the child ' because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak ' , the couple has decided to go through with the birth and ' surround ' the child ' with people who love it '			1
ms @entity8 described her unborn child , now 19 weeks old , as ' healthy			2
the heartbeat 's beautiful '			0
' the brain activity 's good , ' she told the @entity92 's @entity91 , ' in both brains			0
' the condition , an extreme form of conjoined twins known as craniofacial hyperhidrosis or diprosopus , is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded			1
despite the medical unlikelihood of the baby surviving past infancy , the couple has decided to surround her with ' the love ' of their large family			2
the couple , who live on welfare in a public housing block in the @entity12 suburb of @entity10 , said their strong ' family base ' meant they could protect the child , no matter her deformities			2
surrounded by seven children who range in age from teenagers down to the youngest , who is in a high chair , mr @entity9 said they had refused to end the pregnancy on ' moral ' grounds			1
' we thought it was the same as bringing home a child with autism or @entity130 , ' he said , ' i do n't really believe in terminating a baby if it 's healthy and growing fine			2
' the @entity9 family of western @entity12 ( pictured ) plan to embrace the arrival of mother ( right ) @entity8 's eighth child , even though the deformities it suffers will make ' schooling , growing up , friends ' a challenge @entity144 of @entity8 and @entity9 and their seven children who live in this four bedroom public housing property ( above ) in western @entity12 may ' ridicule ' the family for keeping their conjoined daughter , but they are determined to protect it with their love teenage sisters of the unborn baby , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 ( above ) do n't think their mother should have terminated the child who @entity156 said ' might be deformative , but it 's still a baby ' which they will love it was early january when the couple made the discovery of their baby 's condition during a routine ultrasound which was anything but			1
during a scheduled appointment , the sonographer told ms @entity8 ' something was up ' and sent her to the couple 's gp , who broke the news			1
the doctor told the couple their baby had ' a conjoinment of the vaults of the skull , which pretty much said there was a conjoined twin , ' mr @entity9 said			1
initially , he was ' shocked , confused , a little bit of everything â€¦ i was n't sure how to take in what he was explaining to me , " mr @entity9 told @entity91			2
ms @entity8 was too far along in her pregnancy to abort the child			2
further tests were made and and a meeting with their obstetrician the couple saw images of their baby 's duplication , which occurs only in four per cent of conjoined twins			1
but the specialist 's advice to end the baby 's life was met with the couple 's firm resolve to ' go through with it '			2
' everything happens for a reason , ' ms @entity8 said			0
they said they had defied the doctors ' urging them not to bring into the world a child that would be regarded as a freak partly because ms @entity8 had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family ' that gives us a lot of support '			0
' we 've got a really big family , we do n't really involve ourselves in the community except for schools where the children are , ' mr @entity9 said			1
maternal foetal specialist @entity227 has seen several conjoined twins in his career but none quite like this			0
shock and disbelief gave way to acceptance by expectant @entity8 and @entity9 of @entity12 who say ' it will be hard for the community to accept ' their next child ' as a normal person ' but they felt a moral obligation not to terminate the baby @entity8 did not know anything was wrong until 15 weeks into her pregnancy when a routine ultrasound ( above ) showed she was carrying a rare form of conjoined twins called diprosopus , of which only 35 cases have been recorded , and none survived @entity248 of twins happens between days 13 and 25 of pregnancy when the embryo fails ( above ) to split into two separate babies and fusion occurs ' it 's probably the rarest of all the conjoined twins , you 'd be thinking numbers of one in a million to one in two million for this kind of anomaly , ' he said			1
dr @entity227 said there was a good chance the couple 's child would not survive to a live birth but if she did , treatment could prove costly			0
but the burgeoning family said they would ' cross that bridge as it comes '			0
' if we have to go back to work , we will , ' said ms @entity8 who is on a disability pension for her severe rheumatoid arthritis and is looked after by mr @entity9 , who draws a carer 's pension			1
the couple 's three teenage daughters , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity154 said they did not believe their mother should terminate the pregnancy			0
' we 'll love it no matter what , ' @entity155 said			0
' it might be deformative , but it 's still a baby			0
it 's still a human , ' said @entity156			0
the last known case of diprosopus was the birth of baby girl @entity288 in 2008 in a remote @entity290 village			1
she struggled to feed properly due to her condition and two months to the day she was born , she died			1
' if i only get two days with the baby , i only get two days , ' ms @entity8 said			1
' that 's just the time we actually get to spend with the baby and its brothers and sisters get to meet their little brother or sister			0

@entity8 and @entity9 , from @entity12 , already have seven children
@entity309 's condition so rare only 35 cases ever recorded and none survived
foetus has single heart , four limbs and a single ' conjoined ' skull
other children say deformed baby ' still a human ' which they will love
last baby with condition died in @entity290 village at two months
