by @entity0 an ancient cottage which is being restored will not be given a traditional thatched roof because of fears it may be attacked by arsonists from a nearby council estate			0
the @entity8 - listed @entity7 in @entity10 's @entity9 dates back to the late 17th century , when it had a thatched roof , and is currently undergoing a painstaking facelift by the @entity13			1
but because it lies just a few streets away from the notorious @entity18 estate , it will be given a new roof of clay tiles rather than flammable thatch because of the trust 's fears it might be set alight			1
picturesque : @entity7 in @entity10 is being restored but it wo n't have a thatch roof because of arsonists nearby : the @entity27 covers 80 acres of north - eastern @entity10 and is home to more than 31,000 people too close for comfort : the 17th century @entity7 lies close to the sprawling @entity18 estate originally , planning permission was granted to give the brick - built cottage a thatched roof after research showed that 's what it had when it was built			1
but the trust , which hopes to turn the old building into two homes , decided that its proximity to @entity18 , one of the largest housing estates in @entity43 , ruled out investing in thatch			2
the trust has submitted a new planning application to @entity47 seeking permission to re-roof the cottage in clay pantiles instead			2
they wrote : ' while it is disappointing to have to consider the locality of the @entity18 estate as a factor , it is a concern which many passing local residents have informally discussed during the repair programme			2
' the application goes on : ' existing consent has been obtained to re-cover the main property â€™s roof in thatch ... [ but ] it has become a concern that it may be inappropriate to reinstate this covering , primarily due to fears of an enhanced fire hazard			0
' the properties front the road and because the construction is fundamentally single storey , the thatch with its required overhang of the wall plate would be within easy reach of a passer - by			0
the buildings at @entity77 is seeking listed building consent to re-roof it with less flammable clay tiles @entity10 was badly damaged by bombs in the @entity81 and there was an urgent need to rehome people the trust fears that arsonists from the nearby estate might be tempted to set fire to the roof if it were thatched ' it is of considerable concern that this might present an enhanced passive fire hazard , for example from a discarded cigarette , or perhaps of more concern , an allurement to someone to attempt to light the thatch			1
' the @entity77 said that if ' in the future , the situation is perceived to have changed ' , the roof could be recovered in thatch			0
built in the 1960s and 1970s , after slum clearance in the bomb - ravaged city , the @entity18 estate covers more than 80 acres on the north - eastern fringes of @entity10 and is home to more than 31,000 people			1
picturesque : @entity7 dates back more than 300 years and originally had a thatched roof the estate has two secondary schools , several primary schools and two shopping centres , as well as a large cinema , bowling alley and restaurant complex			1
last week , police said they were fighting a huge rise in crime on the estate , with overall crime rising more than 14 per cent in the past year			0
this included a 51 per cent increase in thefts from cars and a 70 per cent increase in shed and garage burglaries			0
in 2011 , @entity18 residents said they were living in fear after a spate of arson attacks , one of which tore through six homes , forcing 20 residents , including small children , to flee their homes .			0
