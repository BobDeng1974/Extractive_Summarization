by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 03:27 est , 22 july 2013 it is expected to be the ‘ must have ’ new video game for youngsters , boasting some of the best - loved characters from @entity6 films			1
but to the dismay of parents , @entity7 comes with a potential price tag of more than £ 250 – and is said to put pressure on children to add a ‘ never - ending ’ string of extras			1
the interactive game works by placing collectible toy figures on a @entity17 – a portal that operates through an existing games console to ‘ warp ’ the character on to the screen			1
to infinity and beyond : the interactive game will be released next month and additional figures are set to be launched before @entity26 , when the pressure to fork out for the ' must have ' toy of the moment is at its peak starter packs , including the video game , base and three toy figures , are expected to cost between £ 50 and £ 60 on release next month			1
but it costs £ 12 to add each of the 17 other figurines available , and £ 4 for add - on packs that can improve strength and speed in the game			1
more figures are expected to be launched before @entity26 , adding to the pressure on parents to give in to pester power			1
@entity47 , founder of parenting advice site @entity48 , said : ‘ i do worry that at the moment so many parents are strapped for cash			0
‘ it ’s not a cheap present – and to go back to school and find @entity57 down the road has all the characters will make it hard			0
it is a never - ending thing			2
parents need to know what they ’re signing up to			0
’ concerns have also been raised about the £ 4 add - ons that can provide new powers or change the background of the game			1
mrs @entity47 said : ‘ i ’m not sure i like that your character can be better because your parents have more money			0
’ the @entity7 concept borrows heavily from @entity74 , a hugely successful game that has more than 100 collectible character figures in a similar price range			1
bank of mum and dad : concerns have been raised that the game 's £ 4 extras are sold as adding strength and speed to the characters the @entity7 starter packs come with the characters @entity89 from @entity90 , @entity91 and mr @entity92 from @entity92			1
additional play sets will feature ‘ villains ’ , ‘ sidekicks ’ and characters from @entity6 ’s latest live action film @entity99 , starring @entity100			2
@entity6 argues the game offers value because the figures can be traded between friends and used on different consoles such as the @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
constantly upgrading and expanding the game with characters from existing and upcoming films means that it can not become obsolete either , says the @entity113 movie giant			2
it is also claimed that the game educates youngsters as they learn ‘ basic programming ’ to create unique challenges , scenarios and mini games in its ‘ @entity120 ’ mode			0
@entity7 ’s lead producer @entity122 said : ‘ i have two boys , ages two and four , and i like the idea that they can be learning about how to do logical connections using the toys in the @entity120			2
‘ we can bring in toys like buttons and doorways , and you can connect the button to the doorway and have the button open the door when you step on it			0
‘ it seems very basic , but at the same time we ’re talking about logical inputs and outputs			0
it really is a lightweight programming language			0
’ a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ @entity7 will deliver incredible value to consumers			2
‘ each of the play sets features an original , true - to - property experience offering hours of gameplay and in the @entity120 mode , players will have endless possibilities to create unique challenges , scenarios and mini games			0
‘ in addition , there ’s a lot of opportunity for exploration , multiplayer and other options that will extend play time and encourage replayability			0
