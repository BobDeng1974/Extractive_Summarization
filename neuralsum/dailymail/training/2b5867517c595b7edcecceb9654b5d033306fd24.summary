plans to protect seahorses in @entity2 and around the @entity3 have been shelved so yachtsman can moor their boats plans to protect seahorses and other sea life were shelved yesterday so yachtsmen can moor their boats			1
officials said establishing marine conservation zones in @entity2 ’s @entity12 and around the @entity3 would have had major implications for sailors , including restrictions on where they could anchor			1
the decision – by environment ministry @entity18 – was condemned by campaigners			1
@entity20 , of @entity21 , said anchors break fragile eelgrass , which is the habitat of many underwater species			2
there will now be a consultation exercise on the establishment of 23 conservation zones – 14 fewer than first planned			1
@entity12 is two miles from @entity30 , @entity32 ’s most expensive strip of coastal real estate			2
it is also the only place in the @entity32 where both native seahorse species – the spiny seahorse and the short - snouted seahorse – are known to breed			1
close to @entity40 , the bay is the only place in the @entity32 where both native seahorse species - the spiny seahorse and the short - snouted seahorse - are known to breed			1
numbers have fallen dramatically in recent years			0
in 2009 a survey recorded 40 spiny and two short - snouted seahorses in the bay , but last year researchers could only find a single juvenile male swimming there			2
the eelgrass which grows in the bay is also home to endangered undulate rays , native @entity56 oysters and a huge variety of vulnerable fish and molluscs			2
@entity20 , head of living seas at @entity21 , told the @entity61 : ‘ people sail their yachts out of @entity40 and come to @entity12 for a gin and tonic			0
‘ the damage is done when they chuck their anchors over the side			0
it breaks the fragile eelgrass , which is the habitat for many , many species			2
’ in a report on the decision , @entity18 officials said locals had complained their businesses would be hit by restrictions to watersports			1
they wrote : ‘ the designation of the site is expected to impact on commercial fishing , local port and harbour activity and recreational boating activities , with high costs associated with the port and harbour sector and recreational boating			0
’ they said imposing such a zone on the area would cost the local economy £ 80,000			0
but mrs @entity20 dismissed the costs , saying : ‘ £ 80,000 would not buy a shed in that part of the country			0
’ a yachting ban would not needed , she said			0
boats could instead tie up to floating buoys rather than dropping anchors which damage the sea bed			0
three more planned conservation zones were also shelved around the @entity3 because of similar impacts to yachting and recreation , which @entity18 estimated would cost the economy a combined £ 290,000			1
yachting associations have long denied they are part of the problem			0
close to @entity40 , @entity12 , near the @entity30 , pictured , is the only place in the @entity32 where both native seahorse species - the spiny seahorse and the short - snouted seahorse - are known to breed @entity113 , spokesman for the @entity114 , said in september : ‘ @entity12 has been used by generations of boat owners , going back the last 70 years and eelgrass has always been there			1
‘ why is there suddenly an issue now ? there is a huge body of evidence that states this type of eelgrass is very resilient and if damaged it puts on a growth spurt to recover			0
’ the 14 proposed conservation zones dropped by @entity18 also including four in the @entity126 , where officials are concerned about the impact on commercial fishing , four off the @entity132 coast which will be deferred to the regional authority , and two others for which they need more information			1
each will be reconsidered in the next round of licences in 2016/17			0
just 27 marine conservation zones currently exist in @entity143 waters			1
experts say 127 experts are needed			0
@entity18 said the proposed 23 new sites would cover more than 3,800 square miles , protecting important seabed habitats and species .			2

there had been plans to establish marine conservation zones in @entity2
would have protected species , including the @entity32 *'s* only native seahorses
but plans were shelved so yachtsmen can moor their boats nearby
