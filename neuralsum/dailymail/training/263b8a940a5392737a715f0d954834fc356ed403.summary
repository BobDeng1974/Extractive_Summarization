by @entity0 since 1966 only two players based in @entity2 have won the @entity3 as starters in the final - @entity5 , who were members of the @entity11 side that beat @entity12 3 - 0 in 1998			1
but all that could change this summer with three @entity8 players - @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 - in @entity19 ’s squad for favourites @entity12			1
it would have been four but @entity22 has agreed to sign for @entity23			1
the first @entity25 connection at @entity26 came when the club appointed @entity19 as manager in 2008			2
but he was sacked after eight months after falling out with a number of influential players , including @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			0
blue boy : @entity8 's @entity17 is looking forward to the prospect of playing in the @entity3 in his home country favourites : @entity8 trio @entity17 , @entity16 ( right ) and @entity15 ( left ) have a good chance of lifting the @entity3 @entity41 : @entity19 's spell as @entity8 boss lasted just six months after he was sacked in february 2009 now the second wave of @entity46 influence has proved far more successful			1
@entity15 was signed from @entity47 in 2010 after he had been @entity12 ’s stand - out player at that year ’s @entity3 in @entity48			1
it was his goal in @entity50 that helped @entity8 gain an unlikely result to reach the @entity53 final in 2012 , which they won			0
in the past few years , @entity57 ’s @entity46 revolution has gathered pace			0
@entity22 signed from @entity47 at the start of 2011 and immediately became a cult figure among @entity8 fans			2
@entity17 arrived from @entity62 for £ 25million in 2012 and @entity57 gazumped @entity63 to sign @entity16 nearly a year ago			0
with @entity67 now back in charge and seeking a more pragmatic approach , the influence of @entity12 may wane in coming seasons			0
@entity17 and @entity22 did not feature towards the end of last season - and now @entity22 is leaving			0
even so , @entity8 may yet be about to have a trio of @entity3 winners on their hands			2
on the move : @entity8 's @entity46 defender @entity22 has agreed to join @entity76 champions @entity23 feat : @entity7 and @entity5 were the last @entity2 - based players to win the @entity3 in 1998			1

three @entity8 players are in @entity19 's @entity12 @entity3 squad
it would have been four @entity46 but @entity22 has agreed to sign for @entity23
