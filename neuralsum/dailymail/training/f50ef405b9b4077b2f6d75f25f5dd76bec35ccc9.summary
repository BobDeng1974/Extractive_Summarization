@entity0 believes the strong @entity2 core of his current @entity4 squad will ensure the team does not break - up			1
having ended their trophy drought against today ’s opponents @entity11 in last year ’s @entity13 final , there is a belief the @entity15 can go on to emulate some of @entity0 ’s previously successful sides			2
over the years @entity4 have begrudgingly allowed their top stars move to rival clubs ; the likes of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have all left the @entity25 in recent seasons despite the @entity0 ’s attempts to keep them			1
having been criticised over the years for a seeming reluctance to use @entity2 talent , @entity0 has come full circle and now has seven key first - team members who are homegrown , including @entity37 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity35			1
and @entity0 is confident having a strong homegrown contingent will make it easier to ensure his current group does n’t disband like previous squads			2
@entity0 says @entity59 players find it easier to stay loyal to the club if rivals try to sign them @entity52 ( left ) and @entity35 are two key members of @entity0 's young @entity59 contingent @entity65 made his return to football after nine months out for @entity4 's @entity68 on friday night ‘ are @entity59 players more loyal ? it ’s easier for them , ’ said the @entity69			1
‘ when you buy a player from @entity74 at some stage he might want to go back to @entity74 because @entity74 is a big club as well			0
‘ a guy who is @entity59 , who is from @entity77 and plays for @entity4 , why should he go ? ‘ but we had loyalty from people like [ @entity82 ] @entity81 and [ @entity84 ] @entity83 , too			2
‘ they had a lot of success here			0
they were respected here and respected the values here			0
they live in @entity77 - that is also a special attraction			0
’ @entity4 have failed to hold on to the likes of @entity20 and @entity22 in recent years five @entity4 players - @entity37 , @entity35 , @entity52 , @entity32 and @entity30 - played for @entity34 in the @entity97 qualifier against @entity98 on sunday			1
and @entity0 added : ‘ i am very proud of that because for years i have been accused of not developing @entity59 players			1
‘ it shows you , when they are good , they play			0
in a good class you become better			0
that shows the good players will learn			0

@entity4 provided five players for @entity34 against @entity98 this week
@entity0 hopes this generation will be more *inclined* to stay at club
previous young @entity4 stars including @entity20 and @entity22 have left to join rivals in recent years
