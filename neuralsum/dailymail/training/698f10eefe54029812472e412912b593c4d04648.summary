the pitch is what it is and we ca n't do anything about it			1
' but there 's not a lot we can do about it at this stage , we have to stick at it and try and winkle out six wickets ( on thursday ) if we can			0
' groundsman @entity39 was contrite , saying : ' we wanted to produce a pitch with pace , bounce and carry but unfortunately it has n't happened			2
