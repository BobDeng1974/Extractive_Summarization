if you are reading this , it means that i have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue			1
please do n’t be sad , it ’s for the better			2
the life i would ’ve lived is n’t worth living in … because i ’m transgender			2
i could go into detail explaining why i feel that way , but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is			1
to put it simply , i feel like a girl trapped in a boy ’s body , and i ’ve felt that way ever since i was 4			2
i never knew there was a word for that feeling , nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl , so i never told anyone and i just continued to do traditionally “ boyish ” things to try to fit in			1
when i was 14 , i learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness			2
after 10 years of confusion i finally understood who i was			2
i immediately told my mom , and she reacted extremely negatively , telling me that it was a phase , that i would never truly be a girl , that @entity46 does n’t make mistakes , that i am wrong			1
if you are reading this , parents , please do n’t tell this to your kids			1
even if you are @entity16 or are against transgender people do n’t ever say that to someone , especially your kid			1
that wo n’t do anything but make them hate them self			2
that ’s exactly what it did to me			0
my mom started taking me to a therapist , but would only take me to christian therapists , ( who were all very biased ) so i never actually got the therapy i needed to cure me of my depression			0
i only got more christians telling me that i was selfish and wrong and that i should look to @entity46 for help			1
when i was 16 i realized that my parents would never come around , and that i would have to wait until i was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment , which absolutely broke my heart			1
the longer you wait , the harder it is to transition			0
i felt hopeless , that i was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life			0
on my 16th birthday , when i did n’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning , i cried myself to sleep			1
i formed a sort of a “ f * * * you ” attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school , thinking that maybe if i eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock			1
although the reaction from my friends was positive , my parents were pissed			2
they felt like i was attacking their image , and that i was an embarrassment to them			0
they wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy , and that ’s obviously not what i wanted			0
so they took me out of public school , took away my laptop and phone , and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media , completely isolating me from my friends			2
this was probably the part of my life when i was the most depressed , and i ’m surprised i did n’t kill myself			0
i was completely alone for 5 months			0
no friends , no support , no love			2
just my parent ’s disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness			0
at the end of the school year , my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media			1
i was excited , i finally had my friends back			0
they were extremely excited to see me and talk to me , but only at first			0
eventually they realized they did n’t actually give a s * * t about me , and i felt even lonelier than i did before			0
the only friends i thought i had only liked me because they saw me five times a week			0
after a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college , save money for moving out , keep my grades up , go to church each week and feel like s * * t because everyone there is against everything i live for , i have decided i ’ve had enough			0
i ’m never going to transition successfully , even when i move out			0
i ’m never going to be happy with the way i look or sound			0
i ’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me			0
i ’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me			0
i ’m never going to find a man who loves me			0
i ’m never going to be happy			0
either i live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or i live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself			0
there ’s no way out			0
i ’m sad enough already , i do n’t need my life to get any worse			0
people say “ it gets better ” but that is n’t true in my case			0
each day i get worse			0
that ’s the gist of it , that ’s why i feel like killing myself			0
sorry if that ’s not a good enough reason for you , it ’s good enough for me			0
as for my will , i want 100 % of the things that i legally own to be sold and the money ( plus my money in the bank ) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups , i do n’t give a s * * t which one			2
the only way i will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are n’t treated the way i was , they ’re treated like humans , with valid feelings and human rights			0
gender needs to be taught about in schools , the earlier the better			2
my death needs to mean something			0
my death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year			1
i want someone to look at that number and say “ that ’s f * * * ed up ” and fix it			0
goodbye , ( @entity7 ) @entity283			1
