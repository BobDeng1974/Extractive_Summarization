by @entity0 , @entity1 former champion @entity2 admitted the chance to make history had crossed his mind in the opening round of the @entity7			1
an eagle and six birdies in his first 15 holes at @entity11 left @entity2 needing to birdie the last three on the par - 70 layout to record the first ever 59 on the @entity14			1
but after a superb tee shot to six feet on the difficult 16th , @entity2 's birdie attempt slipped past the hole and he eventually signed for an eight - under - par 62 to share the lead with @entity20 's @entity19			1
wish you were here ? @entity2 putts during the first round at @entity23 in @entity24 in the swing : @entity2 leads after the first round of the @entity7 after a brilliant 62 ' on the 16th i thought that if i could make my birdie putt i 'd have a good chance , because the last two holes are decent chances for birdie , ' @entity2 said			1
' but once i missed the putt , i obviously knew the game was up			0
' @entity2 's season has been disrupted by injury , but he arrived in @entity24 on the back of finishing joint fourth in the @entity20 open on sunday			1
we promise it 's him : @entity19 is the early joint - leader after also shooting a superb opening 62 @entity43 to climb : @entity44 of @entity45 chips during the first round amid a stunning backdrop the 31 - year - old from @entity49 won his second @entity14 title here in 2012 and added : ' there 's a great picture of me holing the winning putt with the big screen behind me , so it 'd be nice to recreate that on sunday			1
' this course really suits me			0
it 's a proper golf course , you really need to think a lot and plot your way around , especially off the tee			0
' good shots get rewarded and poor shots get punished , which is exactly the way it should be			0
' it 's a tricky course but if you get on a run , there 's definitely a low score to be had out there			1
i played really well two years ago and i was able to draw on those good memories on my way round today			1
' low scoring was the order of the day with @entity79 's @entity78 and @entity45 pair @entity80 and @entity82 recording rounds of 64 and @entity83 debutants @entity84 and @entity86 in a large group on five under			0
@entity80 , who won his first @entity14 title in the @entity89 at @entity90 last year , recovered from a double bogey on the fourth with four birdies in his last five holes			1
he said : ' it 's obviously never nice to start with a three - putt , but then i holed a good par putt on the 11th so i could 've been two over after two			1
' but the birdie on 15 got me going and from there on in i played really well and felt good about my game			0
i shot five under on my back nine , which is the front nine , and did n't really have to hole any putts of note			2
' when you 're playing that well you just want to make the most of it and luckily i managed to do that today			0
' @entity45 's @entity106 was part of the large group on five under thanks to a 65 in just his second tournament since may due to back problems			0
the 27 - year - old revealed he has had to change his swing due to a broken bone in his back , which kept him out of action from the @entity117 in may until last week 's @entity118			2
' i had a fracture in my vertebrae so it was pretty serious , ' @entity106 told @entity121 4			0
@entity121 's the limit : @entity124 's @entity123 plays a shot during the first round in @entity11 ' initially i thought it was just a pulled muscle but we had a few scans and i had fractured one of my vertebrae so it was rest time and then some rehab			1
' i had to change my swing a little bit and as long as i keeping swinging in the new way then fingers crossed i will be fine , but if i revert to my old swing then it could come up again			0
' defending champion @entity142 , seeking to emulate @entity139 by winning the event for the third time , rounded off a perfect day for @entity83 captain @entity143 with a four - under 66			2
the 43 - year - old @entity144 will play his first @entity83 since 2002 later this month , but added : ' you have to play the golf in front of you and not worry too much about what 's ahead			2
' the score was decent today so it 's a good start			2
' @entity84 is looking for back - to - back victories after sealing his place on the team by winning the @entity154 masters			0
he said : ' we had a few chats about the @entity83 but like @entity142 said , i have two tournaments to play before then so my focus at the moment is continuing the good form and getting my game in shape			0
