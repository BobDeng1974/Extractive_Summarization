i wrote my first column for this newspaper last january , inspired by a year of @entity4 life that had transformed my body			1
despite eating out in restaurants most nights , at 36 i found myself in the best shape ever			2
after all , working out is a way of life in @entity12 , where the city ’s thrusting , competitive spirit means not having a six - pack is a sign you ’ve seriously let yourself go , and where people spend as much on gym kit as on designer handbags			1
i discovered @entity23 – @entity24 – to inspire me along the way ; i kitted myself out in trendy @entity27 gear ( the cult @entity29 line that launches in the @entity31 this spring ) ; i discovered online workouts that were tougher than any personal training session ; and i even put myself on a ‘ juice fast ’ – the craze for surviving on cold - pressed greens for days at a time that ’s still sweeping the city			2
healthy life : fit in @entity42 columnist @entity43 has found a new and healthy lifestyle since moving to @entity12 but one report in particular paved the way for the next phase of my @entity4 fitness journey			1
in june , i wrote about a class called @entity50 , my latest workout obsession , which combined a vigorous cardio workout with spoken affirmations and a mini sermon on the power of positive thinking from the programme ’s creator , @entity57			2
in class , @entity57 talked about how mind and body are one , and of the importance of practising positive self - talk – using phrases beginning with ‘ i can ’ and ‘ i am ’ – if we want to make our dreams a reality			2
it ’s a message i started to hear everywhere as i began tapping into a whole other side to the city ’s wellness scene – where i have found a more spiritual approach to health and fitness			1
and once again , at the start of another year , i feel transformed			0
feeling fit used to be all about the physical for me , but i now understand that true wellbeing – that is , a healthy and happy mind , body and soul – is about a holistic approach			0
after discovering @entity50 , i wrote about what i described as my ‘ yogic awakening ’ – having embraced the ancient practice at a yoga festival in @entity86 with very emotional results			0
this showed me in no uncertain terms how the mind and body truly are linked , and since then i ’ve been working on this side of my health as hard as i used to work on my abs. way to wellness : @entity95 has found inner peace ( stock image ) this has meant regular meditation , increasingly proven by scientists as a way to reduce stress and tackle a range of ailments , from insomnia to high blood pressure			1
it ’s been a way to start listening to what my body really needs – from what workouts i do , to the food i eat			0
this is one of the key messages in @entity116 ’s new book , what are you hungry for ? , aimed at tackling the huge problem of weight control in the @entity29			0
he describes ‘ awareness eating ’ , saying there is a groundswell of people choosing to eat less meat , and cut out sugar , dairy , gluten and processed foods – not because we ’re turning into a population of anxious do - gooders , but because people are starting to realise that eating this way makes you feel better and that , once you feel better , it ’s easier to make healthier choices in all areas of life			1
it ’s a message that the flower power brigade peddled 50 years ago , and which science and mainstream society are finally catching up with			0
in @entity4 , i ’ve found myself surrounded by high achieving ‘ type - a ’ individuals who all embody the concept , believing that looking good and feeling good are intrinsically linked , and i ’m happy to say i ’ve fully embraced my inner hippie too			0
as well as yoga and meditation , i follow a mainly vegan diet , have massively cut down on the amount of alcohol i drink , go for regular energy healing sessions and even visited a shaman to have my chakras realigned recently			0
the results ? i can honestly say i ’ve never felt healthier or happier			0
my outlook on life is the most positive it ’s been in years , which i can directly attribute to beginning to think of fitness as looking after every aspect of my overall wellbeing			1
i ’ve even started my own website , thenuminous.net , which covers all areas of what i like to call ‘ now age thinking ’ when it comes to health and wellness			1
and i ’m not alone			0
a whole tribe of trendy wellness bloggers has emerged , with names such as @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			1
these sites are run by hip , switched - on @entity4 women who might have been writing about fashion in another life , and through their eyes things like checking food labels for chemicals and whipping up raw , vegan , gluten - free desserts seem aspirational and cool			1
it ’s just another part of @entity116 ’s groundswell movement towards the holistic mind - body wellness approach that i believe will shape fitness in 2014 .			2
