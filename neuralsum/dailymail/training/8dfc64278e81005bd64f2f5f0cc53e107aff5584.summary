by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 18 march 2012 updated : 05:42 est , 20 march 2012 for the second time during the primaries , @entity2 presidential hopeful @entity1 has made a blunder about @entity6			1
on the day @entity6 head to the polls to cast their votes for the nation 's next president , mr @entity1 referred to the archipelago as a ‘ @entity13 - speaking country			1
’ in fact , @entity6 is not a country at all , but an unincorporated territory of the @entity17			1
last week , the former @entity19 senator told a @entity6 newspaper that the territory ’s admittance as the @entity17 ’s 51st state was contingent on its residents speaking @entity25 as its official language			1
ok by me in @entity17 : today , @entity1 slipped and called @entity6 a @entity13 - speaking country claim to fame : @entity1 ( left ) claims he 'll win the @entity2 nomination if he can beat @entity31 ( right ) in @entity32 this tuesday - despite estimates that he trails @entity31 by some 240 delegates @entity6 's residents can not vote in general elections , but are set to award 20 delegates in their sunday @entity2 primary			1
turnout appeared light around the island , and officials predicted about 150,000 people would cast ballots in the @entity2 primary			0
among them was @entity46 , a 76 - year - old pro-statehood architect who was supporting mr @entity31 , in part because the former @entity49 governor had secured the endorsement of gov. @entity51 and other leading politicians			2
' he has a stronger connection to @entity6 and that will help us in the process of becoming a state , ’ mr @entity51 told the @entity58			0
he had kind words for mr @entity1 , describing him as a ' person of faith , a good @entity62 , ' but thinks the former senator hurt himself with his statements that @entity25 should be the official language			1
' in @entity6 , we get along fine with both languages , ' he said			0
on saturday , mr @entity1 boldly claimed he ’ll garner the @entity2 nomination if he wins tuesday ’s primary in @entity32			1
speaking yesterday in the state , he said : ‘ if we ’re able to come out of @entity32 with a huge or surprise win , i guarantee you , i guarantee you that we will win this nomination			1
’ however , rival @entity31 rebutted by asserting that his prospects look the sunniest , saying : ‘ i bet i ’m going to become the nominee			0
’ @entity75 marks the spot : @entity6 's governor @entity51 shows his ballot to the press after marking it with an ' x ' under the photo of @entity31 during the @entity2 presidential primary election mr @entity31 ’s claim seemed much more suited , as he currently leads mr @entity1 by an estimated 243 delegates ; @entity32 will only award 69			1
' if we 're able to come out of @entity32 with a huge or surprise win , i guarantee you that we will win this nomination			2
' - @entity1 however , recent polls show the former senator is favoured by conservatives in the state ’s southern areas			1
the former @entity49 governor told @entity96 sunday : ‘ i ca n’t tell you exactly how the process is going to work , ’ referring to the rest of the @entity2 primaries , which run through june 26			0
he continued : ‘ i sure hope i ’m going to become the nominee , and if i am , i ’m going to be a strong nominee			0
’ @entity103 : yesterday , @entity104 gathered to support @entity1 at @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity32 he faces brighter prospects in tuesday ’s primary , as @entity32 is generally seen as friendly territory			1
in addition , mr @entity31 has a big edge in delegates , campaign cash and organizational resources			2
odds aside , mr @entity1 appears resolute			0
he told @entity116 's @entity115 that ' we 're in this to win ' and that there 's too little difference between mr @entity31 and president @entity120 to satisfy conservative @entity2			0
mr @entity1 says conservatives want a chance to nominate a conservative to take on the @entity125 incumbent and ' we 're going to give them an opportunity			0
' the former @entity19 senator has n't qualified for the ballot in all the states on the election calendar and sometimes has had trouble fielding full slates of delegates in some states			0
but he says he 's doing pretty well with scarce resources , compared with the deep - pocketed @entity31 campaign			2
the @entity140 state 's republicans are relatively moderate and on paper should give @entity31 a boost after he lost to @entity1 in @entity143 and @entity144 this week			1
@entity32 is @entity125 president @entity120 's home state and is expected to vote for @entity120 in the november 6 presidential election over the @entity2 challenger			2
but many republicans believe he needs more than just delegate math and must produce some big wins in the state - by - state campaign to prove he is a worthy front - runner			0
' if @entity31 wins @entity32 , people will say he is sealing the deal as a front - runner candidate , ' @entity2 strategist @entity153 told @entity157			1
delicious dish : @entity31 attended a pancake brunch at the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity32 reason to smile : current estimates place @entity31 miles ahead of any of the other @entity2 hopefuls ' if he loses , then they 're saying he still has a lot of work to do and he 's relying on delegate math and that he may win by the numbers but he also has to win by momentum to generate enthusiasm			1
' forces loyal to @entity31 are pouring money into @entity32			1
@entity31 and his backers are believed to be spending more than $ 4 million there , while @entity1 's outside group announced a $ 310,000 effort			2
word on the street was that @entity31 came under pressure to win @entity32 from some of his financial backers during a day of fundraising in @entity183 on wednesday			2
' the money guys made it clear that you 've got to win @entity32 , ' said a veteran @entity2 strategist , who asked to remain unidentified			0
mr @entity31 campaign sources cast doubt on the comment and said they were not aware of any such demand			0
' i do n't think anything big happened or i would 've heard about it , ' said one			0
mr @entity31 has already had big victories this year when his back was against the wall			0
he won @entity199 decisively after losing @entity200 to @entity201 , and turned back @entity1 in @entity202 and @entity203 .			0

called @entity6 ' @entity13 - speaking country ' though territory is actually unincorperated @entity17 commonwealth
said last week that territory must declare @entity25 as first language to gain statehood status
@entity1 asserts he will get the presidential nomination if he wins @entity32
however , he trails @entity31 in polls by an estimated 243 delegates
@entity32 only awards 69 delegate
