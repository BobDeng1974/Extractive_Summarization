the man , who is believed to be @entity7 , walked into the shop in @entity9 , north @entity10 , and claimed his wife was pregnant and needed water			1
he can be seen touching shopkeeper , @entity13 , on the stomach to demonstrate his wife 's baby bump , before the man falls into what appears to be a trance - like state			1
this is the moment a brazen thief walked into a shop in @entity9 , north @entity10 , and speaks to the owner mr @entity13 , 56 , who runs @entity25 off licence , only comes to after the thief has rummaged through his pockets and made off with the contents during the bizarre incident on september 11			1
the 45 second heist is believed to be the first time the crime , which has been reported in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , has been filmed in @entity35			0
mr @entity13 said : ' i ’m so upset about what happened			0
it ’s hard to talk about but i want to help stop this happening to other shopkeepers			0
' it was late and i was tired , i ’m not sure but it was like i was hypnotised			0
' he said his wife was in trouble and needed someone to help her			1
' while he was touching me he took all the money from my right hand side , which had my float money , and all the money from my left			1
' he was touching my stomach saying " my wife is pregnant " - it ’s an old trick of the professionals			1
' i was thinking , what should i give to him ? maybe he wanted water , tonic water ? ' i feel really shocked by it			2
i thought , " why is he touching me ? " but by that time it was too late			2
' the man can be seen talking to the shopkeeper where he claims that his wife is pregnant and needs water the footage shows the man , who is believed to be @entity7 , touching the shopkeeper 's stomach his wife , @entity68 , said : ' his friend was outside and could n’t believe he was allowing him to touch him like that			1
' he thought maybe they were friends or maybe he had some sort of hypnotic powers over him			0
' i feel like we were targeted i saw a few people hanging around the shop a few days before			2
' hypnotherapist , @entity78 , told @entity79 : ' if someone is naturally very highly hypnotisable it would be possible to do something like this			0
' the thief , in this case , would probably have visited the shop a few days or weeks earlier to assess the level of hypnotisability of the shop keeper and to observe how the takings are handled			1
' it 's extremely rare in the @entity35 for a crime to be committed using hypnosis but strangely , in @entity34 , there are about half a dozen crimes committed like this each year			0
' as a general principle you can not get anyone to do anything against their will using hypnosis and far from being a circus act or means to commit crime , it is a highly therapeutic tool			0
' @entity107 , a hypnotherapist based in @entity10 , was more sceptical and said : ' pickpockets distract their victims constantly and this guy has learnt a technique and stuck to it			0
' what he is saying will be important as well as the motions			0
the touching of the stomach meant that he did n't notice when he put his hands in his pockets			1
he is attempting to demonstrate his wife 's condition but it appears that the shopkeeper falls into a trance he then rummages through the man 's pockets , taking what he can , before making off down @entity127 ' we go into trances all the time - when we 're watching television , reading books , when we 're half asleep in the morning			1
it 's about turning off the attention centre in the brain			0
' but mr @entity107 made it clear that the thief is no @entity137 and added : ' it 's similar to someone who learns one thing and can do it well , but the whole point is he was distracting			2
' officers investigating the theft described it as an ' elaborate stage act ' which they have never seen used anywhere else in the @entity35			0
they have now released the @entity147 from the off licence on @entity127 in a bid to track down the thief			1
detective sergeant @entity151 , @entity152 in @entity153 , said : ' the victim in this incident said that he was momentarily unaware of what had happened to him			2
