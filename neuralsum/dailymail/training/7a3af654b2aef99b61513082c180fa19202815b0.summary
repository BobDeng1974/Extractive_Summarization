by @entity0 for @entity1 a classical musician is suing police for loss of earnings after a @entity6 stopped him from busking in a town centre and called him a ' beggar and a ' vagrant '			1
professional flautist and singer @entity10 , 48 , was singing @entity13 arias and playing music in a shopping precinct in @entity16 , @entity17 , when the female community officer ordered him to move on saying he was causing an obstruction			1
the intervention under the @entity21 forced mr @entity10 , from @entity22 , @entity17 , to abandon his five hour stint after just 45 minutes			1
@entity10 , 48 , has launched a case against @entity25 claiming loss of earnings after being told to move along by a @entity6 and apparently being called a ' beggar ' and a ' vagrant ' while he performed the professional flautist and singer was singing @entity13 arias and playing music in a shopping precinct in @entity16 , @entity17 , when he was moved along by the @entity6 under the @entity34 1824 he later consulted a solicitor and has now filed complaints to @entity25 and the @entity37			1
the father - of - one who received his classical music training as a flautist and tenor singer at @entity42 for two years before training at the @entity44 said : ' i am not a beggar or a vagrant - i am a professional musician , classically trained who has been through years of training to learn my craft			1
' i have been in orchestras and choirs			2
i can sight read , i can join a group of musicians and sight read straight away and i find it very sad the @entity6 should react in this way			1
' it 's bad a day when buskers are tarred with the same brush as aggressive beggars			0
we 're not doing any harm - in fact we are playing beautiful music			2
busking is a great @entity67 tradition but it seems someone in authority wants to restrict street culture and that is bad for all for all performers who perform in the street like me			2
' i always try to be a responsible performer , never obstructing and definitely never asking for money			0
i simply play so people hear my work and it 's a great platform for showcasing what i can do			0
there is no way i would demand or pester anyone for money			0
' mr @entity10 , who also plays viola , entered the music industry at 16 having picked up a flute when he was just eight years old			1
the father - of - one claims he lost about £ 40 in earnings after his set was cut short after just 45 minutes the singer was performing a number @entity13 favourites including @entity93 when he was moved along after leaving college he became a blue coat entertainer at a @entity97 holiday camp and has played with a variety of musicians including @entity101 singer - songwriter @entity100 and jazz saxophonist @entity102			1
the incident occurred last month while he was performing in sale town centre when he started singing @entity13 favourites like @entity93 and a complaint was made to the police			1
mr @entity10 , a high baritone , said : ' a pcso arrived and said the complaint had been about someone singing and dancing and there was a lady dancing nearby who was nothing to do with me			1
there are no laws against busking in the @entity67 , although those wishing to do so are strongly advised by authorities to seek permission from the local council			1
each authority operates a different policy on busking but some stipulate that a licence is necessary to be able to busk in a public area			2
while busking is not illegal , there are rules which those doing so must follow			2
they are : children under 14 are n’t allowed to busk			0
in contrast , under the @entity21 , it is an offence to sleep rough or beg in @entity135 and @entity136			1
those doing so will be told to move along and can be arrested			1
those who continue to persistently flout the law can face jail for the offence			0
' i said to the @entity143 , " can i stop you there ? i am not with this woman			0
i work on my own			0
" the lady even told the @entity6 she was n't with me			1
but the @entity6 just signalled me out and called me a beggar and a vagrant which got me really upset			1
' as i remember she said " you are a beggar "			2
she only said that when it was just me and her			0
i told her it was wrong and that her comment was inflammatory			2
' i said " i am not a beggar , i am a street performer "			2
she replied " actually it 's not , its vagrancy "			0
' i was so shocked			0
they are meant to know the law and enforce the law fairly but she had it all wrong			0
' ' she told me i was causing an obstruction and told me to move on			1
i could n't believe it			0
' i always make sure my equipment is contained and not obstructing anything			0
she could clearly see that			0
to be sent away at midday meant i missed out on a good four more hours of performing			0
' mr @entity10 who claims he can earn up to £ 90 in one day of street performing believes he missed out on £ 40 because of the incident			1
he added : ' i rehearse many hours a day and to be called a beggar is very insulting			1
when i busk i normally stay all day but after this incident i left after 45 minutes			0
' i was in choirs from a young boy as a soprano and my mother was a soprano			0
she is one of the main reasons i became classically trained - she said if you are going to be a professional musician you might as well do it properly			2
' he said : ' i have been trying to make it for years but sadly i have n't have my break yet			0
but if i had a penny for the times people come up to me when i am busking and say " you should be on the tv " or " you should n't be here " , i would be a rich man			2
' there are so many talented singers out there but some like me are n't lucky enough to get discovered			0
i reckon i lost about £ 40 and i can not afford to lose this money			0
' mr @entity10 started out as a blue coat entertainer at a @entity97 holiday camp and has played with a variety of musicians including @entity101 singer - songwriter @entity100 and jazz saxophonist @entity201 @entity25 said : ' we can confirm a complaint was made about officer conduct and they have been advised			1
' the @entity37 confirmed it had also received a complaint			0
@entity206 confirmed it does not issue a specific licence for busking but added : ' if we are contacted by someone about busking we advise they should be mindful of shoppers and businesses by responsible and not cause an obstruction or nuisance			1
' they are also advised to be considerate and move on if asked by a business or the police			1
