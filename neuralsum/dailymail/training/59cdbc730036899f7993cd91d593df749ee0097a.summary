by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 27 february 2013 the discovery of shoes deliberately hidden in an ancient @entity4 temple has left archaeologists baffled , not least because they include design features thought to have been invented in @entity7			1
two pairs of tiny children 's shoes were among the seven found concealed in a jar placed into a cavity between two mudbrick walls in a temple in @entity15 , site of the ancient city of @entity17			1
oddly , they were tied together using palm fibre string and placed within a single adult shoe			0
a third pair that had been worn by an adult was found alongside them			0
@entity24 in @entity15 , @entity25 : the discovery of ancient shoes with design features first thought to have been invented in @entity7 in one of the city 's temples has left archaeologists baffled but there is no clue as to why the shoes , which would have been costly and unusual footwear for the era , were never retrieved after they were left in the temple just over 2,000 years ago when @entity25 was ruled by a dynasty of @entity41 descent			1
research has shown that at least one of them includes structural elements that historians had previously believed were not invented until the @entity7 era , which began in @entity48 some 500 years later			1
at the time the shoes were concealed , most @entity25 would normally have worn sandals			1
the shoes were discovered by an @entity53 archaeological team in 2004 , but a new study has now offered fresh insights into them			2
the modern city of @entity15 in southern @entity25 is the site of the @entity4 city of @entity17 and is a popular destination for tourists			1
with the ruins of the temple complexes at @entity24 and @entity15 standing within its borders , it has been frequently described as the ' world 's greatest open air museum '			1
@entity17 was the great capital of @entity25 during the @entity69 , and the glorious city of the god @entity71			0
in the @entity4 texts the city was regarded as ' @entity17 ' , meaning ' city of the sceptre '			0
and also as ' ta ipet ' , meaning ' the shrine '			0
in a later period , the @entity41 called it @entity17 and the @entity80 after them @entity81			0
the importance of the city started as early as the 11th dynasty , when the town grew into a thriving city , renowned for its high social status and luxury , but also as a center for wisdom , art , religious and political @entity93 grew to world - wide prominence during the time of the @entity69 , when the @entity96 undertook military expeditions to @entity98 , in today 's northern @entity99 , and to the lands of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , bringing back great wealth to the city			2
the main god of the city was @entity71 , who was worshipped together with his wife , the @entity109 , and their son @entity110 , the @entity112 of the moon			0
with the rise of @entity17 as the foremost city of @entity25 , the local god @entity71 rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god @entity118 , thus creating the new ' king of gods ' @entity71			0
his great temple , at @entity24 just north of @entity17 , was the most important temple of @entity25 right until the end of antiquity			2
@entity124 , assistant director of the @entity126 - @entity125 in @entity127 and an expert in ancient @entity4 footwear , says it is likely the shoes were foreign made and ' relatively expensive '			1
' the find is extraordinary as the shoes were in pristine condition and still supple upon discovery , ' wrote dr @entity124 in the most recent issue of the @entity137 in @entity25			2
unfortunately , he added , after they were unearthed the shoes became brittle and ' extremely fragile '			2
since sandals were by far the most common footwear of the era in @entity25 , the style and quality of the discovered shoes was such that ' everybody would look at you ' , dr @entity124 told @entity148			1
after being shown photographs of the seven shoes , dr @entity124 made a number of discoveries about their design			2
most surprising was that the single shoe discovered with the child 's pairs inside was made with a feature that shoemakers know as a ' rand ' - a structural device that was thought to have been first used in @entity7			1
folded leather strips that go between the soles and the upper parts of shoes , rands reinforce the stitching as ' the upper is very prone to tear apart at the stitch holes ' , dr @entity124 told @entity148			1
they would be useful in muddy conditions where shoes are under pressure , so to find the device in the dry climate of @entity25 is surprising and indicates that the shoes were made somewhere abroad			1
dr @entity124 also found that the shoes ' owners would have tied them using what researchers call ' tailed toggles ' , which are leather strips that pass through at the top of the shoes			2
after they were knotted into place a long strip of leather would have hung down decoratively on either side			0
dr @entity187 's analysis of the shoes also revealed insights into the health of their owners			0
he found a semi-circular protruding area in one that could have been caused by a bunion , while of the pair of adult shoes the left had more patches and evidence of repair than the right			0
' the shoe was exposed to unequal pressure , ' he told @entity148 , which showed that person who wore it ' walked with a limp , otherwise the wear would have been far more equal '			0
the wear and tear and subsequent repair showed that the people who wore them valued the shoes as ' highly prized commodities ' , dr @entity124 said , deepening the mystery of why they were left in the temple			1
' there 's no reason to store them without having the intention of getting them back at some point , ' he told @entity148			0
he speculated that there could have been some kind of unrest that spurred the owners to leave their fancy shoes behind and flee hastily .			0

shoes feature ' rand ' device which helps bind upper to sole - and has only before been seen in footwear from @entity7 and later
they were deliberately hidden in a cavity between two mud brick walls in a temple in @entity15 , but researchers have no idea why
they would have been ' relatively expensive ' and unusual , since most people of the era wore sandals
