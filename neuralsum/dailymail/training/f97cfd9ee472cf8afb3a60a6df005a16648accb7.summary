by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 08:18 est , 5 november 2012 homeless families could be sent hundreds of miles away from the areas of @entity3 they hail from because councils are desperately trying to save money			1
as the government prepares to cap housing benefit allowances at Â£ 400 per week from april , local authorities in the capital are buying or renting houses in places like @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , it has been revealed			1
council bosses say rising rental costs in their areas coupled with @entity20 cuts are forcing them to send the homeless to places nowhere near their own neighbourhoods			1
@entity24 : families from @entity3 are being sent all over @entity26 because their councils will not house them nearby ( file picture ) so instead they are acquiring properties in counties around @entity3 like @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 as well as much further afield			2
but the government has said clearly that ' as far as is reasonably practicable ' they must offer housing in their own area			0
this was because it was discovered that @entity40 , one of the @entity43 boroughs , had decided to relocate people to @entity45 , to the fury of then housing minister @entity47			0
but critics have said @entity3 councils have no choice			0
angry : former housing minister @entity47 was furious when it was revealed that councils were considering sending families across the country @entity55 , chief executive , of the @entity56 told the @entity57 : ' families are facing the impossible situation of being told to move to cheaper accommodation that just does n't exist with @entity3 's rising rents			1
@entity3 boroughs are staring at a black hole in their budgets as a result , with costs transferred from central to local government			2
' there 's still time for government to do the sensible thing and think again when these reforms are debated in parliament before thousands of @entity3 's families find themselves uprooted , overcrowded and thrown into turmoil			2
' @entity3 councils have acquired rental properties in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 in preparation for welfare cuts , the @entity57 has found			0
' it is going to be practically impossible to provide affordable accommodation to meet our homelessness duties in @entity3 , ' @entity90 , director of housing and strategy at @entity93 council in east @entity3 told the paper			1
' as the pressures increase we will be looking to procure well out of @entity3 , and even out of the home counties			0
' one cabinet member for housing in an inner city borough added : ' let 's face it , a lot of people with more than two or three children , and who are dependent on benefits in this borough are not going to be here for very much longer			0
' @entity43 borough : @entity117 , the home of the @entity116 , was accused of trying to send people to @entity119 - on - @entity120 the 33 @entity3 councils were asked if they were already placing people outside of @entity3 and more than half said told the @entity57 they already were			1
but the @entity20 insists that councils do not need to do this			0
' it is neither acceptable , fair nor necessary for local authorities to place families far away from their area			1
the law is already clear that local authorities must secure accommodation within their own borough so far as reasonably practicable , and new rules will reinforce this , ' a housing spokesman said			2
' our reforms restore fairness to a system that was allowed to spiral out of control under the previous government			0
it 's not right that some families living on benefits should be able to live in areas of @entity3 that hard - working families could simply never afford to stay in			1

local authorities say *sky* - high rental costs in the capital , *combined* with the *incoming* benefits cap has forced them to send people miles away from home
areas as far away as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , as well as the @entity154 are all earmarked for families
' it is going to be practically impossible to provide affordable accommodation to meet our homelessness duties in @entity3 , ' @entity157 say
