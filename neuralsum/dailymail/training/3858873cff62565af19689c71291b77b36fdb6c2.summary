by @entity0 published : 08:41 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 17:10 est , 26 december 2012 [ captio parents who parked outside their home as they carried their seriously disabled boy to their car were shocked to see they had been given a ticket			2
@entity6 , 37 , briefly left his @entity7 people carrier in front of his house as he and his partner @entity11 , 28 , strapped splints to the legs of four - year - old @entity14 , who has cerebral palsy and can not walk			1
when they emerged from the front door with their son minutes later , however , they found they had been issued with a £ 70 fine			2
despite pleading with the warden to use some common sense , the ticket stood			0
the local council has refused to refund the fine , saying the couple had been warned parking on their road was to be suspended temporarily because the road was being resurfaced			1
miss @entity11 said : ‘ at a time of goodwill to all men , i do n’t think they ’ve shown a lot of heart			1
’ @entity14 is paralysed down his left side , can only crawl and has a mental age of 18 months			1
his parents , whose home does not have a drive , usually have no problem parking outside their front door so they can carry him to the car to take him to school			0
mr @entity6 insisted he had been told he could park in the space by workmen			1
despite his protests , the warden refused to back down and told him to get in touch with the council			1
two subsequent appeals have been dismissed by @entity54			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ they do n’t seem to realise we have no choice			2
we are law - abiding people , but there was nothing else we could do			0
’ ' the car park at the back was blocked with vehicles			0
' father - of - three mr @entity6 , who had just dropped his other sons @entity66 , ten , and @entity14 's twin @entity67 , at school , said he has even taken pictures of other cars parked on the road at the same time which did not receive tickets - but to no avail			1
refused : @entity76 city council has rejected two appeals from the couple over the parking fine but both have been rejected a @entity54 spokesman said the family 's car was reported as ' obstructing ' the resurfacing work			1
he said : ' letters were sent to all the properties in @entity87 advising of the roadworks and temporary parking restrictions			2
' this was followed up with warning notices and the road was well marked with restriction signs			0
' @entity94 has had her representation against the ticket turned down but she still has a right to appeal to an independent adjudicator			0
' other vehicles did not receive tickets as they were parked on sections of the road that had already been resurfaced and were not obstructing the work			0

@entity6 and @entity11 had been fitting *special* splints to son @entity14 , four , when warden appeared
temporary restrictions had been *imposed* outside their home
@entity76 council refused two appeals because their case ' lacks merit '
