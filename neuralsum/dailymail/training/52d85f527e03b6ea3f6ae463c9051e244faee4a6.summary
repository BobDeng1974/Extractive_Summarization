it is an unwelcome truth that many of us now celebrate a culinary triumph or top notch restaurant meal not by instantly diving in - but with a photo session			0
the phrase ‘ @entity17 before you eat ’ has entered common parlance and we no longer flinch when the party at the table next to us begins snapping away at their plate ( though we draw the line when they come over to snap ours - true story )			0
however , new research from @entity26 suggests that oversharing and consuming ‘ food porn ’ on social media sites such as @entity17 , @entity28 and @entity29 can make it less enjoyable to eat			1
many people simply can not start eating a meal without ensuring they have shared the experience with friends and followers sharing ' food porn ' on social media sites such as @entity17 , @entity28 and @entity29 can make it less enjoyable to eat looking at those pictures of perfect eggs benedict or your friend ’s incredible sunday roast efforts can ruin rather the whet the appetite by making you feel like you have already eaten the food			1
the study found that overexposure to images of foods increases our sense of satiation ( a drop in enjoyment associated with repeated consumption ) when we actually eat those same foods			1
one of the study ’s coauthors and @entity26 professor @entity60 explains : ‘ in a way , you ’re becoming tired of that taste without even eating the food			1
' it ’s sensory boredom – you ’ve kind of moved on			0
you do n’t want that taste experience anymore			0

after rating each picture based on how appetising that food appeared , each participant finished the experiment by eating peanuts , a salty food			2
participants then rated how much they enjoyed eating the peanuts			0
