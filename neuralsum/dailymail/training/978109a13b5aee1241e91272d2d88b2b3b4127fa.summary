by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 03:07 est , 8 august 2012 sitting on board an @entity3 boat , @entity4 appeared casual and relaxed as he watched the rs : @entity7 windsurfer medal race with @entity8 , the greatest sailing olympian of all time yesterday			0
but politics were still on his mind as he publicly rebuffed @entity12 yesterday after the @entity13 decided to wreck @entity14 plans to slash the number of @entity16 and redraw constituency boundaries			1
the prime minister said he would still hold a vote on the issue despite the betrayal of his @entity23 partners – a move designed to humiliate the @entity13 if they publicly oppose something they have vocally supported in the past			1
nice view : @entity4 watches the sailing competition on @entity3 boat looking out to sea : @entity4 , right , talks with @entity34 's gold medalist of @entity36 sail class , @entity8 during the rs : @entity38 medal race in @entity39 prime minister @entity4 walks with @entity41 's @entity40 medalist @entity8 on the pontoon at @entity39 and @entity43 ahead of the men 's @entity44 today crowd spirit : @entity4 and his wife @entity47 take part in the wave cheer during a women 's semi-final beach volleyball match between @entity51 and the @entity52 @entity53 will now personally target mr @entity12 , who has previously made impassioned pleas supporting boundary changes when he marshalled the legislation through the @entity57			2
mr @entity12 said in september 2010 : ‘ to the people we serve it is patently obvious that individuals ’ votes should carry the same weight , and if that means reforming the rules for drawing boundaries , that is what we must do			0
that unfairness is deeply damaging to our democracy			0
’ the 2010 @entity13 manifesto also vowed to ‘ reduce the number of @entity16 by 150 ’ , yet the deputy prime minister is now opposing a cut of just 50 mps to 600			1
mr @entity12 unveiled the tit - for - tat move on monday after @entity77 @entity16 refused to back his plans for @entity80 reform			1
mr @entity4 is under pressure from his backbenchers , who plan to summon him to their influential @entity83 next month to explain how he will win a majority at the next election now that the @entity53 seem unlikely to pick up the gains in seats boundary changes might have delivered			2
the prime minister made clear that he would not back down and now plans to pile pressure on @entity13 ministers by arguing that it is fair and sensible that constituency boundaries be redrawn			1
fight back : @entity12 , pictured leaving his home today , has accused the conservatives of breaking their coalition agreement over the @entity97 decision : visiting an activity centre in @entity100 , mr @entity4 made clear he intended to push forward with the changes when they come back to the @entity57 in the autumn the current system is seen as unfair since some seats contain nearly twice as many voters as others , so the @entity53 tend to need an 11 per cent lead in the opinion polls to win a majority compared with just 3 per cent for @entity110			0
mr @entity12 ’s decision to ditch support for the plans could cost the @entity53 20 seats in 2015			0
the deputy prime minister wants to see the boundary review abandoned			1
but mr @entity4 said yesterday : ‘ we want the boundary change vote to go ahead			0
i am going to be saying to every mp , “ look , the @entity123 ought to be smaller , it ought to be less expensive and we ought to have seats that are exactly the same size ”			0
‘ i think everyone should come forward and vote for that proposal because it is a very sensible proposal and it will be put forward			0
’ mucking in : @entity4 takes part in a team building maze puzzle at the centre speaking out : prime minister @entity4 speaks to young adults in the @entity132 scheme who are taking part in team building exercises , at the @entity135 the prime minister also said he ‘ does n’t accept at all ’ claims by mr @entity12 that the @entity77 party has broken an agreement with its @entity13 coalition partners			1
senior @entity77 backbenchers are furious that the @entity13 have abandoned support and are agitating for mr @entity4 to kick them out of the @entity142			1
an influential figure on the backbenches told the @entity145 that if @entity13 ministers are not threatened with the sack for defying government policy , @entity77 ministers would now rebel themselves and the @entity23 would collapse into ‘ chaos ’			2
@entity13 foreign office minister @entity152 insisted @entity97 and boundary changes were part of the same ‘ constitutional package ’ and should both be abandoned			2
he confirmed that he would vote against them			0
in fact , the @entity157 linked the referendum on electoral reform to the boundary changes – not , as the @entity13 claim , to @entity80 reforms .			2

vowed to press ahead despite a *warning* his @entity13 coalition partners intend to wreck the plan
deputy prime minister will order his mps to oppose the new boundaries after a vote by @entity77 backbenchers *derailed* his plans to reform the @entity80
