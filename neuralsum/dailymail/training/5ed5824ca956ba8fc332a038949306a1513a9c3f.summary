@entity0 , 58 , was told he had cerebral palsy when he was five but as now found out he had a congenital deformity and has finally been treated a man who has lived his whole life believing he has cerebral palsy after being diagnosed as a child has discovered more than 50 years later that he never had the condition			1
@entity0 , 58 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was told he had cerebral palsy when he was just five years old and has spent his life struggling to walk and using wheelchairs			1
it was only when his son , @entity14 , 31 , started feeling pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago that doctors quickly realised the condition may be a congenital deformity			1
now , almost half a century after he was first diagnosed , mr @entity0 has undergone knee and hip replacements , as well as an operation on his shoulder ball and socket , which has left him completely pain free			1
mr @entity0 , the former national vice chairman of charity scope , said : ' i could n't walk until i was six and it was always very painful			1
i was sent to a special school as they thought i would never really be able to do anything			0
' when i was eight they transferred me to mainstream school because they realised my intelligence appeared to be normal			0
' i never let the condition i thought i had hold me back but i accepted that i would always be in pain and there was no cure			2
' to find out that the condition i actually had could be treated was a dream come true			2
' the father of two , who also has a daughter called @entity43 , said he owed a lot to the orthopaedic teams from @entity46 who have operated on him over the last 12 weeks			0
he said : ' i have two children and my son started having a pain in his left hip every winter			0
' after that it was obvious to doctors that it might be a congenital condition that i had passed down to him			2
they then realised it was operable			0
' he said he now feels like the @entity60 - the fictional television character who was given bionic implants - after the operations allowed him to walk without pain for the first time in his life			1
he said : ' when i was a child i used to watch the programme , the @entity60 , and i thought why they could n't do that for me so i could walk ? that 's come true			0
' the @entity70 has done that for me			0
there 's a lot of knocking of the @entity70 but these were risky operations and for them all to be successful is remarkable			0
' the father of two only found out he had a congenital deformity as opposed to cerebral palsy when his son @entity14 , 31 , started suffering similar problems five years ago and doctors realised it could be a genetic issue over the last 12 weeks , mr @entity0 has undergone a number of operations , including a hip and knee replacement , at @entity46 ( pictured ) and can now walk completely pain - free for the first time @entity0 , 58 , was told he had cerebral palsy - a neurological condition which affects movement and co-ordination – when he was aged five			1
he could n’t walk until he was aged six and as he grew older he struggled to walk unaided and relied heavily on wheelchairs			1
he was in a lot of pain and did n’t doubt his diagnosis as symptoms of cerebral palsy include muscle stiffness and weakness , balance and co-ordination problems and uncontrolled body movements - all issues he was suffering with			1
there is no cure for the condition so mr @entity0 was forced to live with the diagnosis			2
however , when his son @entity14 , 31 , started suffering from pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago , doctors realised the pair could be suffering from the same condition			2
after ruling out that @entity14 was suffering from cerebral palsy , medics started to investigate his symptoms and realised he was suffering from a congenital deformity passed down from his father			1
congenital anomalies , which can result in long - term disabilities , are wide - ranging and in some cases – like the @entity122 - can cause weak muscle tone and developmental delay			0
during adulthood , individuals with a congenital deformity experience reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs , an abnormal curvature of the spine , impaired muscle co-ordination , and joint deformities			1
@entity0 experienced these symptoms as a child but it was n't until his son was genetically - tested that doctors realised they both shared the gene and that his symptom was hereditary instead of cerebral palsy			1
having spent 15 years on the board of directors for @entity146 and four as national vice chair , mr @entity0 retired in 2007 due to his medical situation			2
he also previously chaired @entity149 and now hopes to return to work to help ' pay the @entity70 back '			0
his desire to return to work has seen him write to every police force in the country to inquire about employment opportunities			0
he said : ' i want to work to pay the @entity70 back			0
what 's the point in having all this done and sitting at home ? '			0
