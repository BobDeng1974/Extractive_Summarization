issues : the new @entity28 website , @entity29 , is not working the way it should			2
the government admits it needs to be fixed as it is causing ' frustration ' ' the president will directly address the technical problems with @entity29 - troubles that he and his team find unacceptable - and discuss the actions he has pushed for to make it easier for consumers to comparison shop and enroll for insurance while work continues around the clock to improve the website , ' a @entity34 official said on sunday			1
the president will say the product itself and the goal behind it - insuring millions of uninsured @entity23 - are good despite the problems that have plagued its roll - out			0

opposed : senator @entity86 has said the @entity28 rollout has been ' a fiasco ' the @entity28 is expected to provide private health coverage to an estimated 7 million uninsured @entity23 through the new online marketplaces that opened for enrollment in all 50 states on october 1			1
but the website , the administration 's online portal for consumers in 36 states , was hobbled by problems including error messages , garbled text and delays loading pages			1
administration officials blame the problems partly on an unexpectedly high volume of visitors in its first 10 days			0
according to @entity54 , there were more than 19 million visits to the website			0
' we are committed to doing better , ' the department said in its blog post on sunday			0
