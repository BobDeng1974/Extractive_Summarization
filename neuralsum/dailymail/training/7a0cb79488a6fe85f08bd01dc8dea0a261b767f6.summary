@entity0 now seems to rewrite the goalscoring history books every week , and with saturday ’s latest strike for @entity5 the @entity3 superstar broke a @entity7 record that had stood for 79 years			1
@entity0 ’s second - minute goal in @entity5 ’s 4 - 0 victory over @entity10 on saturday took his total to 17 in the opening 10 games of the @entity15 league season			1
that surpassed @entity18 ’s long - standing record of 16 goals for @entity20 in 1935			2
last month the 29 - year - old superstar beat @entity23 ’s record from 1943 of 14 goals in seven @entity7 games after scoring a double in a 5 - 0 win over @entity28			0
@entity0 has also scored for 13 games in succession in all competitions			0
17 goals in nine league games this season			0
274 goals in 261 games for @entity5			0
194 goals in 174 @entity7 games			0
22 @entity7 hat - tricks			0
17 @entity36 goals in 2013 - 14			0
if he keeps up his scoring average of 1.7 goals per game , @entity0 could end up with a staggering 65 league strikes to his name this season , should he play every one of @entity5 ’s remaining fixtures			1
that would comfortably beat @entity68 ’s remarkable record of 50 goals in a @entity7 season , set in 2011 - 12			1
the @entity74 striker ’s goals - per - game average then was 1.4			2
@entity0 already holds the record for the most goals in a 38 - game @entity78 season			1
he notched 31 goals in the 2007 - 8 season , a feat matched by @entity82 for @entity37 last term , before moving to @entity5 for a then world record fee of £ 80million in 2009			2
@entity0 ( left ) scores from the penalty spot against @entity74 during last week 's @entity87 @entity89 ’s record of 323 goals for @entity5 is the big number in @entity0 ’s sights , and with 274 to his name already it is seemingly inevitable that record will also be smashed			1
in fact , should @entity0 keep up his current @entity7 scoring ratio this term and @entity5 progress to the later stages of the @entity36 and / or the @entity101 , he is guaranteed to do it before the end of this season			1
@entity104 hails ' fantastic ' @entity0 and calls for real to maintain form			0

@entity0 scored his 17th @entity7 goal this season on saturday
@entity0 broke @entity18 's record for opening 10 games , set in 1935
@entity5 striker has *stunning* goals - per - game ratio of 1.7 this term
@entity89 's all - time @entity5 record is under *threat* , as is @entity68 's @entity7 haul
