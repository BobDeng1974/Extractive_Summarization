grandfather - of - four @entity7 , 59 , and his wife , 56 , have been transforming their semi-detached house into a winter wonderland to celebrate @entity12 for the last ten years			1
the entire building is covered from top to bottom in twinkling fairy lights while the front garden is full of illuminated @entity12 - themed ornaments			1
@entity19 and @entity7 from @entity20 in @entity21 , have spent the last 10 years transforming their home into a winter wonderland the house and garden is covered in more than 40 sets of lights and there are at least 15 inflatables - including several life - sized @entity30 as well as a @entity32 and @entity33 wearing @entity12 outfits mr @entity7 said : ' we love doing this every year and seeing the reactions of the children			1
' many insist on coming round every day to look at the house and a lot of adults love it too			2
we like to help get people in the @entity12 spirit and have a bit of fun			0
' the house and garden is covered in more than 40 sets of lights and there are at least 15 inflatables - including several life - sized @entity30 as well as a @entity32 and @entity33 wearing @entity12 outfits			1
there is even a rotating @entity55 complete with elves swinging from @entity12 candy canes			0
another unique garden feature is an igloo with a snowman which leaps out at intervals before hiding back inside			2
but the finishing touch is a snow machine which pumps out dozens of litres of snow at the flick of a switch , blanketing the house and garden in @entity69 , @entity21 , within minutes			1
making use of @entity73 they installed to ward of vandals , the couple catch unsuspecting passers - by by surprise , flicking the switch to start the snow - making machine , which douses their front garden with dozens of litres of snow the incredible display has cost the couple more than £ 5,000 over the years - with each inflatable costing between £ 80 and £ 300 - and @entity7 and mrs @entity84 say they plan to continue adding to it the couple first started decorating their home at the behest of their 32 - year - old daughter @entity90 , who wanted to put up a decoration of @entity5 climbing up the side of the house mr @entity7 said : ' we installed @entity73 outside a few years ago after the display was vandalised - the inflatables were all cut with a knife			1
' but we have quite a bit of fun with the @entity73 now and turn on the snow machine when we spot someone on the camera coming near the house			1
' people now think the snow machine has a sensor or something on it and we watch them on the little screen in our living room jumping up and down in front of the snow machine to try and get it to turn on			1
' then when they go to walk away we turn it on and they come running back			0
it 's a lot of fun			0
' the incredible display has cost the couple more than £ 5,000 over the years - with each inflatable costing between £ 80 and £ 300 - and they plan to continue adding to it			2
but , perhaps fortunately for the couple , they do n't know how much it costs them in electricity to run it			0
' we pay a set amount by direct debit every month , ' mr @entity7 explained			2
' so we do n't actually know how much it costs to run all the @entity12 lights and the inflatables , which each have their own fans to keep them upright , as the electricity bill seems to even out over the year			2
' the inflatables ’ fans are turned on at 9am so they can be seen throughout the day and the lights are switched on by a timer at 4pm every day			2
the couple turn everything off around 10pm			0
mr @entity7 and his wife , who have two children , first started decorating their home at the behest of their daughter @entity90 , 32 , who wanted to put a decoration of @entity5 climbing up a ladder on the side of the house			1
it grew from there and the couple have been building up their @entity12 decorations collection ever since			0
mr @entity7 , a father - of - two , said : ' a couple of years ago my daughter , who 's just a big kid , wanted us to put this @entity5 on the side of the house			1
' so at first we just had that one @entity5 but then we kept adding something every year until we decided seven years ago to go all out and turn it into a @entity12 house			1
' we try to get something new every year and move things round a bit to make it look a bit different			0
' we also buy lots of light bulbs in bulk so we can replace any that break			0
the couple , who have four grandchildren , have dedicated this year 's display to raising money for a local school for children with learning difficulties mr @entity7 , a father - of - two , said : ' it does take quite a bit of work but we love doing it ' ' it does take quite a bit of work but we love doing it			1
‘ it now takes the couple three days to set up display before the lights can be switched on december 1			0
the couple put on the lights every day over the @entity12 period before they start taking it down on the weekend before january 6			0
mr @entity7 said : ' we like to make sure everything is ready for the lights to be switched on december 1 - to mark the start of @entity12			1
' we set the counter on the front door which then runs down the days until @entity201			0
' the house has become an attraction for locals with many parents bringing their children by to see the spectacular display			0
mr @entity7 said : ' the kids absolutely love it			2
we ’ve had parents tell us the lights drive them mad because their kids insist on being driven to see them every day until @entity12 is over			0
' we also have groups from the @entity214 and rainbows and i dress up as @entity5 for them			2
' it takes the couple three days to set up display before the lights can be switched on december 1			0
they put the lights on every day over the festive period before dismantling the display on the weekend prior to january 6 and after all their hard work keeping their @entity12 display working all month , @entity7 and mrs @entity84 will be able to put their feet up on christmas day as a relative will be cooking the traditional turkey dinner			1
mr @entity7 added : ' it will be nice not to be the one waking up at 6am to put the turkey on this year			2
' but we always have a big traditional , family celebration and this year will be no different			0
' @entity12 is our favourite time of year and we like to take the opportunity to bring a bit of happiness and @entity12 spirit to our friends and neighbours			0
' none of our neighbours have ever complained about the lights - just that they 've sometimes struggled to park because so many people stop their cars to look our lights			1
