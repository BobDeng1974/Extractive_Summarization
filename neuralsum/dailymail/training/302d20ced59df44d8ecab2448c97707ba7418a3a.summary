could friday the 13th at @entity0 really have been anything other than another gruesome evening for @entity2 ? not when @entity3 are the visitors			1
a third successive victory over this crippled giant saw @entity8 ’ side leapfrog their hosts into second place in the @entity12 standings			1
true , they have played three games more but there is only one club here with positive momentum			2
and they do n’t wear blue			2
having witnessed just one defeat in their last 18 league outings , fans of the @entity23 club will awake on @entity26 with a deepened love of their emerging side			1
@entity29 ( second left ) strikes for @entity3 's second goal of the game against @entity2 @entity8 ' side have now overtaken @entity2 to go second in the @entity12 @entity33 ( left ) scored @entity3 's opening goal in the game at @entity0 on friday @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity36 7 ; @entity37 7 , @entity38 6 , @entity39 6 , @entity40 7 ; law 7 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6 ( @entity45 77 ) ; @entity46 ( @entity47 78 ) , @entity48 5 ( @entity49 31 )			1
subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54			2
booked : @entity38 , @entity42 @entity3 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity55 7 ; @entity56 7 , @entity57 7 , @entity58 6 , @entity59 7 ; @entity60 ( @entity61 77 ) , @entity62 6 , @entity33 7 , @entity29 7 ; @entity63 7 ( @entity64 84 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 63 ) 7			1
subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			2
for @entity2 , the contrast could not be greater			1
after chanting against a despised board for much of the game , one section of supporters turned their ire directly towards the players			2
‘ you ’re not fit to wear the shirt ’ was the damning verdict			2
after a dire sequence of six defeats from their last ten outings , no one in @entity86 ’s squad could consider any slander action			2
this was n’t an overall @entity3 performance to rank close to those which established a 7 - 1 aggregate in the two previous league meetings			1
for long spells , they were pressed back into their own half by their own territory			2
but that mattered little come the final whistle			2
through goals from @entity33 and @entity29 , the @entity23 men had the cutting edge where @entity2 had none			1
and 9 - 1 over three games still sounds just dandy to all from @entity109			2
initially at least , it looked as though @entity2 were in the mood to find some redemption			1
@entity113 flicked on to @entity44 and he engineered space for a drive that was beaten out by @entity55			2
@entity48 seized upon the follow - up but his rising shot was headed off the line by @entity58			0
@entity119 ( left ) is on loan at @entity2 from @entity121 but could not turn the game in his side 's favour @entity2 interim manager @entity86 shouts instructions to his team from the sidelines there was a freshness about some of @entity2 ’ early play that was in stark contrast to their recent stale offerings			1
another nice interchange saw a @entity48 right - foot thump from 25 yards tipped over the top by @entity55			0
@entity44 delivered the resulting corner towards the near post and @entity113 glanced in a header that zipped narrowly wide			0
these were signs of encouragement from a home support that once again left significant patches of empty blue seats around the ground			0
further frustration and anguish is , however , never far from the surface in these parts			0
and @entity3 made it bubble up once again by clicking into gear to claim a 19th - minute lead			1
it was , it must be said , a strike that owed much to the static defending of their opponents			0
@entity60 arrowed a pass into the area that found its way to @entity65			0
he got beyond @entity39 too easily but was thwarted as @entity36 bolted off his line to save			0
the reprieve for @entity2 was fleeting			1
@entity33 reacted quicker than @entity42 to the loose ball and slotted home with ease			1
the @entity3 fans celebrated with abandon , with stewards and police forced to move in to re-establish segregation at the corner of the @entity170 and @entity171 stands after apparent scuffles			1
@entity40 ( right ) of @entity2 takes on @entity173 and @entity59 of @entity3 at @entity0 @entity3 's players celebrate the opening goal scored by @entity33 after 19 minutes of the game now the test for the @entity0 players was to respond far better than they did in september			1
back then , a @entity3 opener was the signal for a full - scale first - half collapse			1
there was more resistance this time , but not enough to force a leveller before the interval			0
their cause was not aided when @entity48 hobbled out to be replaced by @entity49			0
and it was n’t long before the substitute toppled inside the area after linking with @entity113 and trying to get beyond @entity56			0
the home fans hollered at referee @entity73 for a penalty , but the lack of reaction from @entity49 suggested a slip			0
as it was , the second period opened in a similar vein			0
@entity2 pressed with @entity3 trying to absorb and wait for counter-attacking opportunities			1
@entity44 went down too easily when picked out by @entity40			0
the @entity200 had @entity57 at his back but would have been better advised trying to get a shot away			0
to be fair , though , @entity44 was again looking like a capable performer			0
a well - flighted free - kick picked out @entity113 , whose header drifted off target			0
having someone in the side who can take a decent set - piece counts as a novelty for the @entity0 men			1
@entity37 got himself on the end of another @entity44 corner , but the @entity215 ’s looping header was tipped away by @entity55 at full stretch			0
there was a sense of pressure building , of an equaliser looming but @entity113 — making his first start since december 6 — blew a prime opportunity to achieve that aim on 57 minutes			0
a deep , arcing cross found him in space at the far post but the striker ’s header was woefully misdirected			0
despite that miss , @entity8 recognised the danger of his side drifting out of proceedings too much out and withdrew @entity65 in the hope @entity66 would provide new impetus			1
@entity2 ' players trudge off the pitch looking dejected after the defeat at home to @entity3 on friday @entity3 's players celebrate the three points that moves them up into second in the @entity12 @entity86 played his final hand with 13 minutes remaining — and promptly drew the ire of the @entity0 crowd for withdrawing @entity44 to introduce @entity47			1
@entity45 replaced @entity113 in the other half of a double switch			0
with nine minutes remaining , @entity3 sealed their hat - trick of wins over @entity2 with an exquisite goal			1
@entity61 , on for @entity60 , dinked a delightful pass into the area and @entity29 finished first time beyond @entity36			1
it was , frankly , the kind of finesse that their opponents so dearly lack .			0

@entity8 ' @entity3 side pile the misery upon crisis club @entity2
@entity33 and @entity29 led @entity3 to victory at @entity0
@entity2 lacked cutting edge as they drop down into third
