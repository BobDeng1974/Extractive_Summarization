everybody knows cats love to curl up in a ball , but @entity4 the @entity3 takes his love of curling into a ball to a new level with a little help from his owner			0
in the 42 - second video , which was posted to @entity13 by @entity14 , the moggy can be seen curling himself up while his owner slides him across a smooth wooden floor			0
the activity looks similar to the @entity18 dominated winter sport @entity19 , however the addition of a cat instead of stones is a novel twist			0
in position : the owner places @entity4 the cat on his back as he gets ready to play the curling game the cat slides at speed for about 15 feet before coming to a halt and sprinting back to his owner within seconds so that he can do it all over again			1
@entity4 's owner laughs frequently as the cat returns and the process of curling and sliding on the floor happens again and again			1
there are a total of six curling and sliding demonstrations by @entity4 the cat and his owner during the short amusing video			0
the video was posted with the line , ' our bengal cat @entity4 enjoying his favourite game '			1
go again : the cat seems to enjoy the activity and he runs back quickly to his owner for another attempt cat curling : the cat loves curling up in a ball and sliding across the floor so much he does it six times			2
