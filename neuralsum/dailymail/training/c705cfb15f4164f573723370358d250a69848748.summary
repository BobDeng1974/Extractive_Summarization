the brutal treatment of sheep at a halal abattoir led to demands for a crackdown on slaughterhouses yesterday			1
shocking undercover footage of workers ‘ hacking and sawing ’ at animals ’ throats has provoked a public outcry			1
last night , campaigners called for @entity13 to be installed in all abattoirs to prevent similar cruelty , and a ban on the practice of killing animals without stunning them first , which is allowed for @entity20 and @entity21 producers			1
one worker has been sacked and three others suspended pending an enquiry the law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering , but there are exemptions for @entity20 and @entity21 producers			1
pictured : a worker throws an animal onto the conveyors the secret filming by @entity44 took place in december at the @entity25 abattoir near @entity26 , @entity27 , where sheep did not appear to be killed according to @entity48 law			1
one worker has been sacked and three others suspended pending a @entity50 investigation that could lead to prosecutions			1
the controversy has fuelled concerns that similar abuse could be going on across the country			0
all abattoirs must be approved by the @entity50 , but the regulatory body does not check whether halal meat is prepared according to religious rules			2
many certify themselves as adhering to halal standards or are accredited by unofficial halal organisations			0
halal rules state that animals must be killed with a single sweep of a surgically - sharp knife through the jugular vein , carotid artery and windpipe while a @entity21 recites a prayer			2
they should not see the knife or witness the death of other animals			2
but the @entity44 video shows many of these practices being flouted			0
its secretly installed spy cameras showed staff laughing as a sheep bled to death after a worker allegedly drew spectacles around its eyes in green paint			1
they were filmed taunting animals , waving knives in front of them , smacking them on the head and shouting at them			1
more than 100,000 people have signed a @entity95 petition demanding a ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first – but the government has refused to outlaw the practice			1
@entity99 , chief executive of @entity100 , said : ‘ i am shocked by the abhorrent cruelty to animals in the slaughterhouse in question			2
‘ whilst i fully support @entity44 ’s call for mandatory cctv , we need the government to close the loophole and to ban slaughter without stunning			1
’ @entity109 , of the independent @entity110 , which monitors the halal meat trade , said of the @entity25 abattoir : ‘ what happened there has nothing to do with halal because the animals were abused well before they were slaughtered			1
campaigners are now calling for @entity13 cameras to be installed in all abattoirs to prevent similar cruelty slaughtermen at the @entity25 abattoir are allegedly seen ‘ hacking and sawing ’ at animals ’ throats ‘ it is to do with the lack of training of the operators and their appalling behaviour			1
the level of animal - welfare problems in our slaughterhouses is appalling			0
' it is not restricted to one type of slaughterhouse or just to halal			0
it is across the board			0
until @entity13 becomes mandatory it will continue unabated			1
’ the abattoir was operating as normal yesterday			2
owned by @entity143 farmers @entity144 , 67 , and his son @entity145 , 29 , the parent company @entity146 had a turnover of £ 29million in 2013			0
a spokesman said the abattoir was accredited with a halal organisation and insisted animal welfare was its ‘ highest priority ’ , adding : ‘ everyone working for us knows and understands the standards we require			0
’ all abattoirs have an @entity50 vet on site			0
however , @entity44 said secret filming at ten slaughterhouses over six years revealed cruelty and illegal actions in nine and proved officials were not doing an effective job			0
@entity44 director @entity166 said none of the filming showed any vets , and described the standard of supervision as ‘ hopeless ’			0
he said the staff allegedly caught mistreating sheep worked in ‘ a killing factory ’			0
in one horror killing at the abattoir , it appears that the men erupted into laughter as a sheep bled to death campaigners did not want to stir - up @entity184 feeling but felt withholding the footage would be a ' betrayal ' a spokesman for the @entity188 called for a national accreditation system for halal meat production			1
he added : ‘ there are urgent questions this case raises			0
since each abattoir is under veterinarian supervision , how were these practices overlooked ? these revelations will undermine @entity21 consumer trust			0
’ @entity199 angered @entity20 groups last night by backing plans to outlaw animal slaughter without stunning , which is necessary for meat to be kosher			0
the party said it would ‘ not allow the demands of religions to override the @entity208 ’s compassionate traditions of animal welfare ’			2
@entity211 editor @entity210 said @entity199 ’s stance meant ‘ jews may not keep kosher and remain in the @entity208 ’ .			2

campaigners calling for @entity13 to be installed in all abattoirs across the @entity208
also want a ban on the practice of killing animals without stunning first
comes after secret footage showed brutal treatment at @entity27 abattoir
