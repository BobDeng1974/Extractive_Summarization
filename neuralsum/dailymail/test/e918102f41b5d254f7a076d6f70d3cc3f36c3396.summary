if anyone won this debate it was the women			0
their less choreographed style of body language gave the impression we were listening to real messages from real people rather than watching spin doctors ’ puppets performing			0
overall i ’m sure @entity14 ’s coaching team will be patting themselves on the back and declaring a win but his gesticulation and approach looked as manicured and choreographed as a @entity20 and @entity21 routine			1
he made no mistakes but there were no surprises either he splayed his legs , he smiled on cue and when he swivelled his huge eyes direct to camera to repeatedly use the phrase ‘ if i am prime minister ’ it was like a hypnotist working his spell on his audience			2
@entity26 kept a firm hand on the leadership rudder			1
he made no mistakes but there were no surprises either			0
unlike @entity48 he appears fully formed rather than a body language work in progress but there were moments like when he pointed to each other leader in turn , taking them all down like skittles , that he might have scored a few more points than expected			0
@entity57 is a good speaker but his performance was vintage , ie a complete re-run of his 2010 routine			1
@entity14 ’s coaching team will be patting themselves on the back and declaring a win following the debate but his gesticulation and approach looked as manicured and choreographed as a @entity20 and @entity21 routine @entity68 ( left and right ) was diminished during this debate , perhaps the only casualty of the night , and it was the women who finally took him down with a few small swats who do you think won the leaders ' tv debate ? who do you think won the leaders ' tv debate ? now share your opinion he took enough pops at @entity26 and waved his arm enough in that direction to signal an official end to the relationship that began in the @entity87 but he looked more congruent agreeing with @entity26 or fielding criticism as a double act than he did turning on him , which looked rather panto			1
for me @entity68 was diminished during this debate , perhaps the only casualty of the night , and it was the women who finally took him down with a few small swats			1
when @entity97 told him he should be ashamed of himself he resorted to gurning to camera , looking like a naughty schoolboy being told off by a firm but kindly head			0
@entity23 ’s speech about ‘ breaking up the old boys network ’ finished off the coup and between @entity23 , @entity106 and @entity107 we got a glimpse of what political debate might be in the future without all the showboating , over-trained , incongruent performances			1
all three women seemed to talk impressively but relatively normally			0
@entity23 was probably the best performer of the night , leaning one elbow on her lectern and looking the most confident of the entire group			2
but although @entity118 feigned fiery but her breathless delivery and dodgy script - reading implied some levels of stage fright			0
@entity57 and @entity68 did the best @entity124 's glassy stares , with @entity57 quaffing water before the first insult had been thrown			1
space and positioning defines power , meaning the line - up of the leaders is crucial in terms of creating the right kind of impact			0
already buoyed up by his ' @entity135 fights back ' appearance against @entity28 , @entity14 struck lucky with the middle spot ( always where the highest status people sit ) and used it to the max. his raised chin and benign smile suggested he was revelling in his new role as a bit of a bruiser and the smile became smugger and smugger during the debate , although his odd , erratic smiling and eye contact suggested he was being worked by some sort of remote control			2
@entity57 and @entity68 did the best @entity124 's glassy stares , with @entity57 quaffing water before the first insult had been thrown @entity57 also used the hallmark gestures of one hand in the pocket to imply blokeishness and the waving dismissively at @entity26 and @entity14 fright : @entity118 , from the @entity158 , feigned fiery but her breathless delivery and dodgy script - reading implied some levels of stage fright @entity163 , the @entity164 analyst , said ' if anyone won this debate it was the women ' @entity23 is a smiling assassin , making her a tricky opponent for @entity26 to stand next to			1
in his après - @entity28 mode @entity26 was looking serious and oozing leadership charisma , although the slight dab of sweat on his top lip suggested he felt under pressure			2
@entity68 on the other hand had a waxy glaze to his skin although he regained his usual bounce and emphatic gesticulation when taking questions from the audience .			0

@entity14 ’s approach was as choreographed as a @entity20 and @entity21 routine
@entity26 kept firm hand on the leadership rudder and made no mistakes
@entity57 's smooth performance was a complete re-run of his 2010 routine
@entity68 was diminished during debate , perhaps the night 's only casualty
@entity23 , @entity106 and @entity107 took him down with series of small swats
@entity23 ’s speech about ‘ breaking up old boys network ' finished off coup
