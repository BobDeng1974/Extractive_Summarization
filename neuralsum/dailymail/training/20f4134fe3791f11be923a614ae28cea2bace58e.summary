by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 8 february 2013 @entity2 : 10:11 est , 8 february 2013 @entity4 space agency @entity3 has released a frightening new video showing just how close a massive asteroid will come to slamming into the @entity7 next week			1
there are just seven days left until the 150ft - wide , 130,000 ton asteroid buzzes past our planet so close its trajectory will take it inside the orbit of communications and weather satellites			1
it will be the nearest known flyby for an object of this size			1
but scientists promise the threatening space rock come no nearer than 17,100 miles from @entity7 when it zips past next friday			1
' no @entity7 impact is possible , ' said @entity23 , manager of @entity3 's @entity24 at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
however , he added , its journey through space will bring it so close to our planet that stargazers from @entity34 to @entity35 will be able to see it with just a pair of binoculars			0
a few hundred satellites orbit at 22,300 miles , higher than the asteroid 's path , but dr @entity23 and other scientists say the chance of it hitting one is also extremely remote			2
nevertheless , satellite operators are being warned about the incoming object for tracking purposes			2
' no one has raised a red flag , nor will they , ' dr @entity23 said last night			0
' i certainly do n't anticipate any problems whatsoever			0
' as yet impossible to see with the naked eye , the asteroid is considered small as these things go			2
by contrast , the one that took out the dinosaurs 65million years ago was 6 miles wide			2
disturbance : this graphic depicts the trajectory of asteroid 2012 @entity64 on feb 15 , 2013			1
this view looks down from above @entity7 's north pole and shows how the rock will hurtle past inside the ring of geo - stationary satellites approach : the trajectory of the asteroid as seen from horizontally from the @entity7 's equatorial plane			1
it will come within 17,000 miles of earth yet @entity77 , as it 's known for its discovery date , still could pack a wallop			0
if it struck @entity7 - which it wo n't , scientists were quick to add - it would release the energy equivalent of 2.4million tons of @entity84 and wipe out everything for 750 square miles around the impact site			1
that 's what happened in @entity89 in 1908 , when forest land around the @entity91 was obliterated by a slightly smaller asteroid that exploded about five miles above ground			0
the likelihood of something this size striking @entity7 is once in every 1,200 years ; a close encounter like this is thought to occur every 40 years			1
the bulk of the solar system 's asteroids are located between the orbits of @entity103 and @entity104 , and remain stable there for billions of years			0
some occasionally pop out , though , into @entity7 's neighborhood			1
the closest approach of this one will occur next friday evening , around 7.30pm @entity108 , over @entity109			1
there wo n't be much of a show			0
the asteroid will zip by at 17,400mph - roughly eight times faster than a bullet from a high - speed rifle			2
the asteroid will be invisible to the naked eye and even with binoculars and telescopes will appear as a small point of light			0
prime viewing locations will be in @entity122 , @entity35 and eastern @entity34			0
observers in the @entity4 and @entity124 will even be able to see that , @entity3 says			2
astronomers using @entity3 's deep - space antenna in @entity27 's @entity128 will have to wait eight hours after the closest approach to capture radar images			1
but the scientists welcome whatever pictures they get since the asteroid offers a unique opportunity to observe something this big and close			0
any new knowledge will help if and when another killer asteroid is headed our way			0
the close approach also highlights the need to keep track of what 's out there , if for no other reason than to protect the planet			0
so far @entity3 has counted just short of 10,000 near - @entity7 objects , the result of a concentrated effort for the past 15 years - and that 's thought to be less than 10 per cent of the objects out there			1
no one has ruled out a serious @entity7 impact , although the probability is said to be extremely low			2
' we do n't have all the money in the world to do this kind of work ' for tracking and potentially deflecting asteroids , said @entity162 , an executive with the @entity24 observations program in @entity164			0
but when asked about @entity3 plans to send astronauts to an asteroid in coming decades , outlined a few years ago by president @entity167 , @entity168 ( ret			1
) said the agency is looking at a number of options for human explorations			0
one of the more immediate steps , planned for 2016 , is the launch of a spacecraft to fly to a much bigger asteroid , collect samples and return them to @entity7 in 2023			1
as for @entity77 - discovered last year by astronomers in @entity181 - scientists suspect it 's made of silicate rock , but are n't sure			0
its shape and precise size also are mysteries			0
colonel @entity162 echoed dr @entity189 's certainty that the asteroid would not hit @entity7			1
he said he anticipates no ' sky is falling thing ' related to next week 's flyby			0
in fact , dr @entity23 said , asteroid 's close approach will will alter its orbit around the sun in such a way as to keep it out of @entity7 's neighborhood , at least in the foreseeable future			1
he and other scientists urged journalists to keep the close encounter in perspective			0
' space rocks hit the @entity7 's atmosphere on a daily basis			1
basketball - size objects come in daily			2
@entity212 - size objects come in every couple of weeks , ' dr @entity23 said .			2

@entity3 insists 150ft - wide , 130,000 ton asteroid will not hit @entity7
but it well be the nearest known flyby for an object this size
asteroid 2012 @entity64 will make nearest approach at 7.30pm next friday
