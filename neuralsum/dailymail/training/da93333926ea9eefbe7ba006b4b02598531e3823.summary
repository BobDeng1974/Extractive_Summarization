by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 22 march 2013 @entity2 phone fans eagerly awaiting @entity4 's eight - core @entity3 will be disappointed after it emerged the @entity2 version will ship with a downgraded processor			1
the latest version of the @entity11 company 's flagship smartphone will arrive on these shores with a only quad - core @entity14 600 @entity13 , the @entity4 has admitted			1
other markets will benefit from an @entity18 octa - core processor , which is the thought to be the most powerful chip yet squeezed into a mobile phone			1
crippled : the @entity3 seen at the unveiling event in @entity22			0
it is emerged that the @entity2 version of @entity4 's flagship phone will ship with a four - core chip , rather than the eight - core chip expected @entity4 had previously said the @entity3 's chip would vary between markets , but it was understood the @entity2 would be one of those where the eight - core processor would be available			1
a @entity4 spokesman told @entity34 : ' @entity3 is equipped with a @entity35 or a @entity37 - core @entity36 the selection of @entity36 varies by markets			0
' the spokesman added that ' in the @entity2 the @entity3 will be available as a 4g device with a @entity40			0
' it is as yet unclear why @entity4 has chosen to downgrade the processor for @entity2 consumers , although @entity44 speculated that it could be because the @entity45 is incompatible with @entity47 networks			2
other markets where the @entity3 is expected to ship with the @entity14 chip include the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
pride : @entity54 , @entity4 's president and head of it and mobile communications , shows off the @entity3 in each of its two colours however , while some @entity4 fans will be disappointed with the firm 's decision , speed benchmark tests have shown that even with the @entity14 chip the @entity3 will be twice as fast as the @entity65 , @entity59 reported			0
the main concern expressed so far over the drop to four cores is that the downgraded phone is likely to have less battery life than its eight core sibling			0
the @entity18 chip , which contains four high - powered cores and four slower cores , is thought to be able to pass over less - intensive tasks to less power hungry sections of the chip - a trick processor developer @entity79 calls @entity80			2
the feature - packed @entity3 , with its always - on cameras tracking users ' eye movements and the like , is expected to be exceptionally tough on battery life			0
it is possible that the @entity2 's @entity3 will be upgraded to an eight - core model later , but @entity4 has as yet said nothing to indicate that might be the case .			2

@entity2 version will ship with quad - core @entity14 600 cpu
that 's a downgrade from the *announced* @entity18 octa - core processor
@entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 will also get the quad - core chip
it is understood the eight - core processor is not compatible with @entity47
