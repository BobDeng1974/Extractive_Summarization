@entity1 's brother today ' categorically denied ' attempting to silence the girl at the heart of the shamed congressman 's latest sexting scandal			1
speaking to @entity6 , @entity7 , a chef in @entity9 , claimed that he ' heard the name for the first time along with everyone else two days ago or perhaps yesterday ? ' he insisted that he had ' never spoken to her or emailed or anything '			2
but @entity16 's close friend and confidante , @entity18 , said that the exchange had left her ' scared and shaken ' and he stood by his claim			2
@entity18 said that the contact was made on april 12 two days after an article ran in the @entity23 in which @entity1 presented himself as a reformed man , after the scandal that saw him leave @entity26 one year earlier			2
communications published in the original exposé by @entity30 in which @entity1 refers to a third party having contacted @entity32			1
which begs the question if it was n't his brother @entity7 , as @entity37 claims , then who was it ? breaking her silence : @entity40 , 23 , talked to @entity41 in an interview that aired thursday night @entity1 's girl : @entity40 , now 23 , claimed that she and @entity1 exchanged racy messages and photos for six months starting in july 2012 her side : @entity6 can now reveal that @entity32 ' confidante claimed him that @entity1 's brother @entity7 tried to keep her from telling her story certainly mr @entity18 is adamant that @entity32 was ' scared and shaken ' by an attempt to silence her at a time when , she insisted , she had told nobody of the relationship			1
ms @entity32 , who reportedly wants to sell her story for $ 100,000 , gave an interview to @entity41 saying that @entity1 , who is married and has a young son , told her that he loved her during their six - month affair			1
in an interview with @entity6 , @entity18 , 29 , a friend and confidante of @entity32 for two years claims : ‘ this happened on april 12 , 2013			1
@entity1 ’s brother contacted @entity64 because she had written something about @entity1 on her @entity67 wall			1
‘ his brother was trying to smooth - over any problems which leads me to believe he may have done this before with other mistresses			0
‘ @entity64 was scared by the contact			0
@entity74 in mind she had never spoken to the brother			0
absolutely she was shaken by it			0
‘ you have to remember at that stage she had n’t told anyone about the relationship			0
‘ she had been sitting on it for months			0
initially she did n’t want the story to come out but this was very clearly a damage control exercise			0
’ when contacted this afternoon , @entity1 's spokesperson , told @entity6 : ' this is untrue '			1
proof : @entity1 sent @entity40 a message saying that his brother had asked him about her months before @entity94 denied knowing who she was or sending her a ' scary ' warning			1
damage control : @entity1 ( seen left at a kitchen event on thursday ) reportedly had his brother @entity7 ( a professional chef , at right ) talk to @entity32 about the status of their virtual affair according to mr @entity111 : ‘ the brothers were acting as each other ’s wingmen			1
it seemed quite clearly what @entity1 had his brother do for him – damage control			2
‘ the irony is by doing so all they did was cause all this to come out because it left @entity64 scared			0
she sent me a message and said she had a story she wanted to tell me			0
’ at that stage , mr @entity111 pointed out : ‘ only @entity64 and her psychotherapist new about it			0
’ the new claim of @entity1 ’s effort to put a lid on @entity32 having clearly detected her growing frustration and distaste for the man she once ‘ idolized ’ is even more damaging in light of his recent ‘ mea culpa , ' in which he claimed to have always been resigned to more information coming out			1
mr @entity111 first met @entity64 in april 2010 when he employed her as moderator and content producer and editor of his political website ‘ we survived @entity138			0
’ the fixer : ms @entity16 's friend claimed that @entity94 approached the issue as if it was not his first time cleaning up @entity1 's mess - again a claim the sibling has denied coming clean : @entity1 , seen here at a food center on thursday , said that he sexted with a total of ' six to ten ' women , both before and after his resignation from @entity26 he became a close friend and confidante of the girl he describes as ‘ beautiful and extremely intelligent			1
’ ‘ i was initially shocked by what she told me and showed me , ’ he admitted , recalling @entity32 ’ revelations to him which began that april and carried over into may			2
according to mr @entity111 the conversations between @entity32 and @entity1 were about politics at first but steadily grew more sexual in nature			1
he said : ‘ he offered her a condo in @entity164			0
he offered to pay for it			0
he offered to help her move			0
he said “ i ’m huge ” referring to his muscles indicating he could help her move furniture			0
’ eager : ms @entity32 first struck up a conversation with @entity1 about his politics but their chats quickly turned sexual and graphic buying her off : @entity1 allegedly said that he would get her a condo in @entity164 where they could meet for trysts in person , as well as lining up a placement on a @entity184 panel in exchange for her deleting their messages he continued : ‘ i believe that this condo in @entity164 was to be nothing more than a sex den for @entity1 so he could show up and have his way with her and go back to his wife and pretend he ’s like a happy family man			1
’ @entity64 idolized this man , mr @entity111 explained			0
he said : ‘ she told me in our conversations that she thought she was in love with him and the way it was described to me she slowly developed a disdain for him in her mind			0
’ she thought he was ‘ a righteous man ’ he added who just liked younger women but ‘ as the relationship unfolded and became more graphic and just about sex that changed			1
’ he claimed that @entity1 called @entity32 to talk about sex or have phone sex ‘ every single day for six months			1
’ continuing on : in spite of the repeated calls for him to drop out of the @entity9 mayor 's race - and the fact he has dropped down to second place - @entity1 refuses to give up @entity64 expressed increasing disdain for @entity1 in may as he stepped up his campaign with the promotion of his keys to the @entity221 programme			2
@entity32 contacted mr @entity111 to tell him she felt ‘ disgusted ’ by @entity1 : ‘ she told me that @entity224 had contacted her one week after his last big mea culpa in public saying how sorry he was for his mistakes and how his wife was standing by him and he had changed and by her disclosing that to me , it makes perfect sense because it was during the time the relationship was ongoing and shows to me that all he is saying now is a lie			1
’ @entity32 , now 23 but she was 22 when they had their relationship , spoke out to @entity41 for the first time since her identity was revealed to say that she was truly in love with the disgraced former congressman			1
she believed the feelings to be mutual , but now she is ' disgusted by him '			0
@entity32 told how she was initially attracted to @entity1 because of his politics but now she has seen another side of him			1
' he 's not who i thought he was , ' she said			0
not listening to the numbers : a poll taken after the scandal showed that @entity1 lost his lead in the race and slipped from first place to second by a significant margin , leaving @entity256 speaker @entity255 in the lead she said that both she and @entity1 said that they loved each other during their virtual romance , and @entity262 - based @entity32 has previously said that he offered to secure a condo for her in @entity164 so that they could meet for trysts beyond the computer screen			1
when asked what she would like to say to him now , she responded : ' stop lying , stop embarrassing his wife , and get help			0
' a preview of her interview with @entity41 was released shortly after @entity1 held a press conference on thursday afternoon where he disclosed an approximate break down of his sexting timeline , just hours after the latest poll revealed he has lost his front - runner lead in the @entity9 mayoral race			2
when asked to clarify how many of those relationships started after he resigned from @entity26 in june 2011 , he said : ' i do n't believe more than three '			2
by his side : @entity281 revealed on tuesday that she was aware of his indiscretions ' before and after ' his resignation and they decided to launch his mayoral campaign today has not been good in terms of any numbers for @entity1 , as the first poll since the @entity32 revelation shows that he has been bumped out of the lead in the mayoral race			1
his drop in the polls comes as @entity1 confirmed he had virtual relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from @entity26 and between six and ten similar situations prior to leaving office			1
the first poll conducted after his relationship with then - 22 - year - old @entity16 was revealed just came out thursday afternoon and has city council speaker @entity301 leading with 25 per cent of the @entity303 vote			0
@entity1 comes in second place with only 16 per cent - down from his earlier 26 per cent lead from a different poll that measured the public 's thinking the week preceding the tuesday revelations			2
in addition to taking away his lead , the release of naked photos and explicit sex chats have driven up his unfavorability rating , bringing him up to an ' all - time high ' of 55 per cent			2
by comparison , his unfavorables were only at 36 per cent in june .			0

@entity94 has denied claims that he contacted @entity40
@entity32 , now 23 , had a virtual relationship with disgraced congressman @entity1 for about six months after he resigned
@entity322 came as he had previously *implied* that he was using his time out of the public eye to work on his marriage to @entity326 aide @entity281
he has now confirmed that he had sent graphic sex messages and photos to three women , and up to seven others before 2011
@entity32 ' confidante claims that @entity1 's brother tried to make sure she would not tell the public about their *raunchy* affair
