by @entity0 and @entity1 the animal believed by some to be the legendary ' goat sucker ' beast el chupacabra was likely a diseased raccoon , but no necropsy will be performed to confirm			1
the hairless , snarling creature was discovered sunday by a @entity12 couple eating corn outside their @entity15 home , they since have had it euthanized because it appeared to be suffering			2
a local game official told @entity19 he believes it was a raccoon with mange , but that no necropsy will be performed on the bizarre creature			1
' the land owner left a message on the warden 's voice mail this morning that the animal had been euthanized			1
' when asked by @entity49 why no further investigation would be done , @entity38 quipped ' our agency does not believe chupacabras exist anywhere but in the imaginations of some			0
' some of those people include @entity31 and her husband , the couple who discovered the bizarre beast and began calling it @entity67			1
she told @entity19 of her sadness at having it put down			2
' it went to sleep peacefully , ' she told @entity19			0
' i had gotten attached			0
i was calling him @entity74			0
' ' we 've never seen anything like it before ' : the couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can id it officials at the @entity84 referred inquiries about the animal to local game warden @entity87 , who has yet to respond to interview requests from @entity90			1
the woman also told the gossip site that she had received several complaints over the unusual animal being kept in a cage and not receiving proper care			2
the couple was in disbelief after first discovering the creature , which she said is likely only a raccoon with mange			1
' he called me to come and look , and i said ' @entity36 that looks like a baby chupacabra , ' @entity31 said			0
the animal was not very large , perhaps the size of a house cat			2
they kept it in a cage , fed it and made sure it had water			0
@entity116 began leaving her voice mail complaints over how they cared for the supposed chupacabra , according to reports			2
they also gave friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek			0
neighbor @entity125 spoke from experience , and insisted it was likely the blood - sucking chupacabra			2
' i hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and i ai n’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there , ' @entity134 told @entity135			0
@entity31 shows where she first happened on the animal she thinks is a chupacabra ' i hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and i ai n’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there , ' said the @entity143 ' neighbor @entity125 and his identification was n't just based on looks : ' a coon does n’t make that noise , or a possum			2
what makes that noise ? i guess a chupacabra does , ' @entity125 said			0
@entity31 and her husband say they kept the animal in a cage , not to harm it , but out of curiosity			0
' we were just trying to figure out what it is because we 've never seen anything like it before , ' @entity31 said			0
no chupacabra has ever been positively identified , of course , and if the @entity166 's find is ever @entity168 'd , it will likely be as a mammal , possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out			1
the stocks are feeding the animal and making sure it has plenty of water mangy ? many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange legend of @entity25 the word comes from two @entity187 words - ' chupar ' , to suck , and ' cabra ' , goat			1
the first reported sighting was in 1995 , when eight sheep were found dead in @entity191 with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood			1
thus , the legend of the livestock killing , vampire - like chupacabra was born			0
since then , the legendary beast has been spotted across the @entity199 and even the world			1
a @entity202 incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on @entity25 in 2012			1
earlier this year , yet another @entity205 sighting came when a @entity207 man actually shot and killed what he claimed was @entity25			1
even a @entity210 town had a @entity25 sighting this past july science attempts to explain scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be @entity25 are actually wildlife like coyotes , foxes , and stray dogs infested with parasites			1
most commonly pointed to is the parasite @entity222 , which causes mange			0
@entity224 is a painful , potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel , making for an even more ghoulish looking beast			2
in humans , @entity222 causes scabies and a consequent itchy , painful rash as the parasites burrow around , leaving their feces under the skin			0
' goat sucker ' : the legend of @entity25 likely originates from a 1995 case in @entity191 where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds			1
it has been described as hairless , or as having spines along its back , and as having blue or red eyes			0

the *small* , black *critter* that some believed to be the legendary beast was put down to end its suffering
local game officials have *decided* against performing a necropsy to confirm what it was
most believed it was only a raccoon with mange that caused the animal 's hair to fall out
the story of @entity25 began in @entity191 when *farmers* found their goats dead and drained of all their blood
