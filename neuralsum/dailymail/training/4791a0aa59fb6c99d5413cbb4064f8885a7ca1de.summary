by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 , the player @entity3 have bought to irritate opponents in the depths of their midfield , breaks into a smile when he considers his nickname ‘ @entity8 ’			1
for fans at his former club @entity11 it appeared he had eight legs , such was the frequency he flicked the ball away from advancing attackers			1
that the match which first saw the £ 12million @entity17 called as such came against @entity18 should instantly warm the hearts of those on the blue half			1
in april 2009 @entity1 provided the sting to @entity23 and @entity24 as @entity18 were held to a 2 - 2 draw at @entity26 in the @entity27			1
@entity28 : @entity1 , then of @entity11 , keeps a close eye on @entity24 during a @entity27 game going nowhere : the @entity17 's strong performance against @entity18 led to his nickname ' @entity32 ' body on the line : the 27 - year - old dives in front of a @entity23 during the 2 - 2 draw at @entity26 ‘ it was during that game that the @entity11 fans nicknamed me the octopus , ’ says @entity1 through a translator			1
‘ at the time @entity18 had a very strong team			0
they had @entity23 and @entity24 was playing really well			1
‘ i played really well and stole quite a lot of balls and that ’s when the @entity11 fans started calling me @entity8			1
it was as if i had a lot of legs ! ’ it can be argued that legs in the defensive third of the pitch is what @entity55 ’s midfield lacked at times last season			1
@entity58 would stride forward to devastating effect without particular concern to tracking back , while @entity61 is a box - to - box player keen to attack			0
@entity1 will sit deep and provide steel , especially when the big games roll around and solidity is imperative			2
‘ i have a very strong defensive game and that is going to help us a lot because teams will take advantage of @entity3 being so attacking , on the counter-attack			1
i ’m going to add very good value in that sense			0
come here ! @entity1 stops @entity75 in his tracks during the @entity77 adding bite to @entity3 's midfield : @entity1 hopes to provide a platform for the likes of @entity58 to thrive from ‘ there are some great players here			1
but every day that goes on i have to work hard in order to get my spot			0
i know my strengths and will work hard to make sure i ’m first choice			0
’ @entity1 , 27 , has been overlooked by his country ever since he was suspended for a year after pushing over a referee during an under - 20 match against @entity92 , who featured a young @entity94			1
he has calmed since then but there are no fears the @entity97 might prove too tough			2
he holds a @entity99 passport having moved to @entity11 in 2007 and this year he tried to play for his adopted home only for @entity101 to rule a match he played at youth level counted as competitive , preventing a switch of allegiances			1
close control : he keeps the ball away from @entity109 youngster @entity108 in 2013 putting his boot in : @entity111 of @entity112 feels the force of @entity1 during a @entity99 league match @entity1 watched @entity116 ’s humbling 7 - 1 defeat to @entity117 at the @entity118 – a match in which @entity61 was replaced at halftime – and says ‘ naturally ’ when asked if he could have reinforced the team			1
‘ there were many errors , ’ he adds			0
‘ but obviously i did n’t have the opportunity to play so we will never know			0
no @entity17 expected that the score would be like that			2
that ’s something that ’s going to be marked in the history of @entity17 football			2
’ of the incident in january 2007 which saw him branded a black sheep in @entity116 he says : ‘ i was very young at the time and it was a hot - headed moment			2
i was playing really well and it was something that really marked my career			0
obviously that has prevented me from going further in the @entity17 team			2
i don ’ t think that ’s the only reason but i think that had a factor			0
‘ it was a moment i learned a lot from			0
it put me in good stead for these days			0
now i always try to be calm and tranquil on the pitch and not speak back to the referee			0
’ helping out : @entity1 smiles at a ' city in the @entity150 ' event held at the club 's @entity152 training ground @entity1 will compete with @entity61 for a place , but they might also play together , representing something of a commentator ’s nightmare			2
their team - mates have already devised a way to differentiate			0
‘ i think they are calling @entity166 ” and calling me “ @entity168 ” , ’ he says with a smile			0
@entity1 was speaking at @entity3 ’s @entity169 at @entity152 , where he joined in to helped the @entity170 train children from local schools and sports clubs in a free soccer school .			1

the @entity17 moved to the @entity176 from @entity11 for £ 12m earlier this *summer*
@entity55 *signed* him to shore up @entity3 's midfield as they look to retain their @entity97 title and *challenge* for the @entity27
@entity1 was nicknamed ' @entity8 ' by @entity11 fans after his performance against @entity23 and @entity24 at @entity26 in 2009
the 27 - year - old says he has ' a very strong defensive game ' following move
he has been overlooked by @entity116 since pushing a referee at @entity192 level
