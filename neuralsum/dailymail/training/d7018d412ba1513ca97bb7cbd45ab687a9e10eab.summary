by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 19:03 est , 17 march 2013 revenue chiefs have been criticised by mps after their ' disgraceful ' tax helpline left millions out of pocket			0
taxpayers had to fork out £ 136 million last year on premium - priced phone lines waiting to speak to @entity7			1
a quarter of their 79 million calls went unanswered			1
now the @entity10 has warned the situation could get even worse , thanks to plans to shut hundreds of tax inquiry centres			2
premium - priced : taxpayers forked out £ 136 million on phone lines waiting to speak to @entity7 last year @entity7 has promised improvements but @entity2 condemned its ' woefully inadequate and unambitious ' new target to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes			1
the committee said there was a ' real risk ' of things actually getting worse with new tax and benefit systems - such as @entity28 's @entity27 welfare system - likely to add to the volume of calls while staff numbers were being cut			2
@entity7 opened a consultation yesterday on closing all 281 of its face - to - face tax inquiry centres in favour of a targeted ' mobile ' system in homes , businesses or community locations			1
' real risk ' : mp @entity40 believes closing all 281 @entity7 face - to - face inquiry centres will add more pressure on its phone lines it claims the move will save customers almost £ 12million a year in lost time and travel costs and slash running costs by more than £ 13million a year			1
but mp @entity40 , chairman of the @entity50 , believes the move would ' undoubtedly put more pressure on phone lines '			0
' @entity7 considers that it will be able to improve service standards by reducing avoidable contact with customers and using its staff more flexibly , ' she said			2
' it may need to put in additional resources , though , to avoid the kind of plummeting performance we have seen in the past			0
' just how the department is going to improve standards of customer service , given the prospect of its having fewer staff and receiving a higher volume of calls , is open to question			0
' @entity7 plans to cut the number of customer - facing staff by a third by 2015			1
at the same time , the stresses associated with introducing the @entity75 , @entity27 and changes to child benefit are likely to drive up the number of phone calls to the department			0
' mrs @entity40 said it was ' disgraceful ' that taxpayers who had no choice about dealing with @entity7 were subjected to unacceptable levels of service when they phoned or wrote			1
and she criticised the department 's ' abysmal record ' in not answering 20million calls in 2011/12 and only responding to 66 per cent of letters within 15 days			0
' we are pleased to see signs that @entity7 is changing its attitude , ' she said			2
' officials are beginning to realise that good customer service lies at the heart of any strategy to maximise revenues while cutting costs			0
cost cutting : @entity7 said closing its centres will save customers £ 12m a year in lost time and travel costs ' however , @entity7 's new target of answering 80 per cent of calls within five minutes is woefully inadequate and unambitious			1
' the new target would still leave 16 million people waiting more than five minutes , the committee 's report pointed out			2
' if there are significant increases in customer contact , @entity7 may need to put in additional resources to avoid its performance plummeting , as it has in the past , let alone improving as it should , ' it concluded			0
@entity7 's problems have happened despite spending £ 900million on customer service			2
defence : @entity7 said it has been answering more than 90 per cent of calls to its contact centres the commons public accounts committee welcomed planned improvements , including a call - back system and a move away from expensive 0845 numbers			1
a spokesman for the @entity7 said : ' this report criticises a previous poor standard of service from which @entity7 has already recovered			0
' in the past three months , @entity7 has been answering more than 90 per cent of calls to our contact centres and during the current year we have replied to 84.5 per cent of the 16 million pieces of post we have received within 15 working days			1
' to make it cheaper for customers to call us , we already transferred our @entity137 phone lines from 0845 to 0345 numbers , and will begin to move our remaining lines to 03 numbers from april			0
' we 're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable .			0
