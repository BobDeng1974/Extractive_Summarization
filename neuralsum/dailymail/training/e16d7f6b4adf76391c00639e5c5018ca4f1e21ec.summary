‘ i was having agonising stomach pain and cramps , ' said @entity3 @entity3 worried something was seriously wrong for nearly ten years before she was finally diagnosed with womb cancer in 2012 and had to have a hysterectomy			1
she says her gp had failed to take her seriously because of her weight			0
‘ i was having agonising stomach pain and cramps , ’ says the 43 - year - old mother of three from @entity10 , who at her heaviest was a size 26 , weighing 18 stone ( she is 5ft 6in )			1
‘ my gp told me not to worry about it : “ you ’re overweight , that ’s all , ” he said			1
’ in fact , he was right : her weight was the problem — but for far more serious reasons than they realised			0
excessive body fat is the direct cause of four out of ten cases of womb cancer , with the overweight ( a body mass index , @entity27 , of 25 or more ) at three times the risk of the disease compared with women of a healthy weight			1
these alarming figures were published last week by the @entity34 in the journal @entity36			0
a high @entity27 significantly raises the risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women as well as colon cancer			2
it also raises the risk of pancreatic , oesophageal ( gullet ) and kidney cancer in men and women			2
the scientists reported that 20,000 cases of cancer in @entity51 each year are directly linked to obesity			1
maintaining a healthy weight would have made these cases ‘ realistically avoidable ’			2
@entity51 is second highest in the world after the @entity56 for the proportion of cancers attributed to obesity			1
yet quite how obesity raises the incidence of cancer is ‘ the subject of fierce debate in the clinical and scientific community ’ , says professor @entity67 , director of the @entity68 at @entity69			1
one clue may lie in the fact that overweight women are more at risk than overweight men			2
a total of 13,000 women a year develop an obesity - related cancer , twice the number of men affected			1
it seems this is mainly because two female cancers lead the obesity - related league table : womb cancer and post- menopausal breast cancer			1
and the female hormone oestrogen — specifically after the menopause — may be to blame			0
before the menopause , oestrogen is made by the ovaries to thicken the lining of the womb in preparation for ovulation , says @entity97 , a gynaecological oncologist at @entity98			2
@entity51 is second highest in the world after the @entity56 for the proportion of cancers attributed to obesity			1
yet quite how obesity raises the incidence of cancer is ‘ the subject of fierce debate ' ‘ each month , progesterone is also produced to enable the lining of the womb to be shed during the woman ’s period			1
’ however , oestrogen is also made in body fat in women : the more fat cells she has , then the more oestrogen she produces			0
‘ after menopause , women with excess body fat continue to produce high levels of oestrogen and these act on the womb lining , but without the regulating effect of progesterone			2
’ it ’s this that ’s linked to womb cancer			1
high levels of post-menopausal oestrogen can also ‘ stimulate abnormal breast cell growth ’ , which leads to more rapid development of oestrogen responsive breast cancers , says dr @entity130 , senior research officer at @entity131			0
this explanation is supported by major research programmes in the @entity56 and @entity139 since 2009 , where scientists tracked obesity - related cancers in two groups of patients : one had bariatric ( gastric band ) surgery while the other did not			2
in the @entity139 study , the women with a gastric band who had lost an average of 44lb were far less likely to develop obesity - related cancer			1
they lowered their risk by 42 per cent , compared with women who did not have gastric bands ( and who gained an average of 3lb )			0
this finding was replicated in the @entity56 yet the studies reported a different pattern in men — for whom oestrogen levels are not a factor in developing cancer			2
they found rates of cancer were not affected by weight loss brought about by gastric bands			2
yet scientists admit they do n’t understand the link between weight and cancer			2
the oestrogen hypothesis does n’t explain why 60 per cent of women with womb cancer are not obese or why a significant number — like @entity3 — are diagnosed before menopause			1
nor does it explain findings that before the menopause , overweight women have less risk of developing breast cancer than women with a healthy weight			1
‘ it seems the impact of having excess weight varies at different stages in life , but we do n’t understand why , ’ says dr @entity130			0
what ’s more , the impact of fat varies according to where it is			0
the extra cancer risk to women has been shown to be caused by fat distributed across the body			2
yet in men it appears to be caused by visceral belly fat — wrapped around organs in the abdomen — according to @entity210 , health information officer at @entity211			0
‘ overweight men are at risk of oesophageal , rectal , colon and pancreatic cancer , affecting internal organs close to the stomach where men are most likely to carry extra pounds			1
‘ fat cells secrete chemicals into the bloodstream constantly and it seems likely cancer in these organs is caused due to their proximity to visceral belly fat			0
’ despite the evidence , doctors still are n’t taking seriously the risk of cancer from being fat			0
take what happened to @entity3			1
the symptoms of abdominal pain and cramping between periods are known symptoms of womb cancer			1
yet though she spoke to her gp twice , there was never a suggestion she should have tests			0
in january 2012 , she began to experience stronger cramping — ‘ just like labour contractions ’ — and severe pain			0
two days later , she woke up in the early hours bleeding vaginally			0
‘ i was terrified , ’ she says			0
that day , she was admitted to a gynaecological unit for tests			0
but once again , she says ‘ it felt as though no one was taking it seriously because i ’m big ’			0
a fortnight later , she was told she had womb cancer			1
two months on , @entity3 had a radical hyster - ectomy , involving removal of the womb and ovaries			1
she did n’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy			0
the hysterectomy brought on the menopause , causing her to have hot flushes and feel low			0
the group @entity261 @entity51 has been a great comfort , she says			1
she has also lost two stone			0
so , what ’s to be done to help @entity3 and the thousands of people who develop cancer as a result of being overweight ? the proportion of people aware that staying a healthy weight reduces the risk of cancer cancer charities stress the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle , but it may be that more radical action is needed			1
last week , the @entity279 ( @entity279 ) updated its weight - loss surgery criteria , with a call for bariatric surgery to be offered to anyone with a @entity27 of more than 35			0
dr @entity284 , of the @entity285 in the @entity286 at @entity287 , welcomes the surgery recommendation as a proven method of reducing the risk of obesity - related cancers for women			0
‘ the obesity epidemic is not abating			0
' we now have proof that for women we can reverse the effect of obesity on cancer risk , ’ he says			1

@entity3 worried for ten years something was wrong
@entity307 told her : ' you *'re* overweight , that *'s* all '
finally diagnosed with womb cancer in 2012
