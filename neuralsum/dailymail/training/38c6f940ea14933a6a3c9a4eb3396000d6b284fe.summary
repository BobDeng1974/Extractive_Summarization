’ meanwhile , @entity78 was forecast to start warming up again this week as passengers on @entity81 journeys endured the worst of the travel disruption today caused by the continuing mid-march cold snap			1
@entity86 transit firm @entity85 cancelled 10 services and there were delays of up to two hours on trains that were able to run , as well as problems on @entity93 services at @entity94 , @entity24			1
but forecasters said that although this week will still be cold , today was expected to see highs of @entity97 , while temperatures could reach @entity99 , @entity100 on friday and @entity101 in time for the weekend			1

conditions were still hazardous on major roads , including the @entity134 and @entity135 in @entity121 and the @entity136 in @entity137 , while drivers on the @entity139 in @entity140 had to contend with sheep on the road			1
but with temperatures creeping up from mind - numbingly cold to merely fairly chilly , travelling for most road and rail users was far less of a problem than earlier in the week , especially on monday			1

due to the hold - ups on the approaches to @entity94 , there were queues for the passenger and freight shuttles on @entity93			2

tomorrow will be mainly clear and dry before rain moves in across the country on friday impressive scene : amazing ice sculptures by the road at @entity165 , near @entity166 , @entity167 , were caused by the wild weather conditions over the past few days further along the @entity24 coast , officials from the @entity170 advised passengers to leave extra time for journeys because of a backlog of traffic entering the port			1
the cold weather was set to continue throughout the day , with temperatures between @entity180 ( @entity181 ) and @entity97 ( @entity182 ) but feeling colder			1
@entity183 , a forecaster with @entity184 , said snow showers were forecast for parts of @entity187 and eastern parts of @entity189 , especially along the @entity191 coast			0
but that snow was unlikely to settle and the snowfall that caused chaos across south east @entity189 and the @entity195 yesterday had cleared , she added			0
she said : ‘ it wo n't be as cold as yesterday but it 's still colder than average for this time of year			0
tonight there will be lows of @entity201 ( @entity202 ) to @entity203 ( 19f ) across the whole country , so it is still really cold			0
’ thousands of travellers endured a miserable day yesterday as the bitterly cold weather cause havoc for road , rail , sea and air journeys			0

they were finally able to dock at the fifth attempt at @entity248 after spending almost 20 hours at sea , arriving at their destination almost 24 hours late			0
@entity252 dealt with hundreds of calls from motorists reporting collisions , broken - down vehicles and abandoned cars as drivers were unable to continue their journeys , prompting warnings to travel only if necessary			2
elsewhere there were strong winds across large parts of the @entity78 creating hazardous conditions			1
in @entity21 , south west @entity22 , a 27 - year - old man was left with serious head injuries after a telegraph pole was blown down			2
one witness told the @entity269 : ‘ i saw the pole falling forwards and a person being struck by the pole			0
i think he was in a very bad way , but the ambulance came very quickly			0
’ unusual feature : water thrown up from a puddle at the side of a road in @entity281 , @entity167 , forms icicles on a part of a roadside hedge as the @entity78 starts to recover from the recent cold snap which brought travel chaos weather - hit : the brunt of the bad weather hit @entity212 and @entity24 as a thick band of snow hit @entity111 and @entity291			1
pictured is @entity293 , in @entity24 stopped : an abandoned motorbike was seen yesterday at the high point of @entity296 in @entity24 after snowfall yesterday , the jagged stump of the pole was surrounded by three traffic cones and local residents told of their shock at seeing the victim on the road as he was attended to by ambulance crews			0
@entity306 , 43 , said : ‘ i initially thought it was a car accident			2
when i went down to look i saw a few cars on the side - i thought they had run into each other			2
it was n't until this morning that i found out what had happened			2
it 's awful , it 's dreadful for the poor man - i ca n't believe it			2
' meanwhile , @entity319 forecaster @entity318 yesterday evening told @entity320 a yellow snow warning remained in place for north and eastern parts of @entity187 , through the north east of @entity189 and down through @entity121 , @entity326 and into @entity327			1
she said the warning was due to last until 11am this morning			0
ms @entity318 added : ' we are still having showers running down the east coast , so there 's potential through that warning period for there to be 2 to 5cms of snow , but locally up to 10cms , but this will be mainly for higher ground			2
' elsewhere , away from these locations , we have a fair bit of brighter weather but there will be a scattering of wintry showers			0
' meanwhile , hundreds of passengers stranded in rough seas off the coast of @entity111 were later trapped at harbour as the ship 's doors failed			0
abroad : dozens of lorries blocked by snow on the @entity354 highway and on a bridge near @entity356 , northern @entity111 white @entity111 : a breathtaking view of the @entity358 in @entity359 under the snow from the @entity362 - @entity361 @entity363 struck the 500 @entity248 - bound travellers twice as the @entity243 sailing from @entity366 , expected to be an overnight journey , turned into a two - day calamity			2
treacherous conditions in the @entity370 prevented the @entity371 - the company 's luxury flagship - from docking at the @entity111 port as scheduled on monday at 2pm			1
but when it finally berthed after five attempts today - 24 hours later than expected - the seafarers , anxious to disembark , were forced to remain onboard a further four hours when the boat 's bow doors jammed			1
@entity243 blamed ' a hydraulic failure ' for preventing them from letting passengers - including 245 @entity111 pupils returning from a school trip to @entity366 - back onto dry land			2
normally in such circumstances a ship would sail back out of its berth and reverse in again so passengers could alight through the stern , or rear , door			0
but because conditions in the usually busy crossing remained dangerous , harbour authorities warned the ship 's captain against moving the ferry			2
an @entity243 spokesman said all the passengers were ' perfectly safe '			0
plans for the ferry to return to @entity366 last night were cancelled and a scheduled sailing from @entity403 back to @entity111 today has also been axed			2
passengers due to travel on the sailings are being contacted while alternative arrangements are being made .			0
