in 1905 a devastating typhoon swept over the @entity1 in the middle of the @entity3 , killing the majority of inhabitants and washing away most of the island			1
just two people survived the storm , but just over a century on , the islands have ‘ grown back ’ from a sandy deposit to lush reef islands			1
now , researchers from @entity13 have studied the reformation of the atoll , which is part of the remote @entity17 , to show how islands can form in relatively short periods of time			2
in 1905 a devastating typhoon swept over the @entity1 in the middle of the @entity3 , killing the majority of inhabitants and washing away most of the island , but since then , the island has regenerated ( pictured ) @entity1 - otherwise known as @entity1 - is an uninhabited coral atoll of 18 islands in the @entity3			1
it is the southernmost atoll of the @entity28 of the @entity17			0
the total land area is only 0.38square miles ( 98sq km ) but it encloses a largely sand - filled lagoon with an area of 1.32 square miles ( 3.42 sq km )			0
the @entity33 atoll was claimed by the @entity34 along with the rest of the @entity17 in 1884			0
after @entity37 , the island came under the @entity38 of the @entity39			0
following the end of @entity42 , it came under the control of the @entity44 until the independence of the @entity17 in 1986			0
on 30 june 1905 the atoll of @entity1 was completely washed over by a huge typhoon that stripped the atoll down to the bare coral			1
all of the some 60 inhabitants perished , save two boys who survived a 24 - hour drift voyage clinging to a breadfruit tree			0
a @entity55 study published in the journal @entity57 documented the changes that have occurred in the @entity1 , also known as the @entity1 , since the terrible typhoon , where large sections of reef were decimated			2
dr @entity63 and professor @entity64 studied aerial images of the islands from 1945 up until 2010 and found that a new island has grown from remains , the @entity62 reported			2
in just over 60 years the island has grown lush vegetation and by studying the aerial photographs they found that patches of vegetation on the once barren landmass have grown by almost 25 per cent , the @entity70 website reported			2
the @entity79 atoll has grown up from a ruined deposit of sandy and coral into a collection of islands including a fully vegetated and stable landmass as well another larger island composed of once separates smaller islands			2
researchers at the @entity55 studied aerial images ( pictured ) of the islands from 1945 up until 2010 and found that a new island has grown from decimated remains the researchers think this rapid regeneration was made possible because the sea around the sandy deposits was so healthy			1
‘ the storm obviously generated huge amounts of sediment and threw up large amounts of coral on to the islands , which has helped them to re-organise themselves , ’ the scientists said			0
@entity1 ( pictured ) - otherwise known as @entity1 - is an uninhabited coral atoll of 18 islands in the @entity3 ‘ they change , they move , they shift - you 'll have a period of erosion on one part and a period of accretion on the other			1
’ dr @entity63 , who lived in the @entity17 for three years , said the changes were rapid and indicate that reef island formation can occur quickly			0
‘ evidence suggests that despite the typhoon occurring over a century ago the geomorphic adjustment of islands is still on - going , ’ he said			0
in just over 60 years the island has grown lush vegetation and by studying the aerial photographs they found that patches of greenery on the once barren islands have grown by almost 25 per cent			1
similar vegetation on the island of @entity131 in the @entity17 is pictured ‘ the take - home message is really that a high magnitude event can both destroy the islands , and set about a series of processes that enables them to return			0
’ they hope the study of the small island will help scientists better understand how new islands are created , which is of particular interest as many people are worried that small islands will disappear under rising sea levels , triggered by global warming			1
sea levels in the @entity3 near the @entity17 are thought to have risen at a rate of 2.2mm a year since 1946			1
studying small islands will help scientists better understand how new islands are created , which is of particular interest as many people are worried that small islands will disappear under rising sea levels , triggered by global warming			1
an aerial view of @entity154 in the @entity157 @entity156 archipelago is pictured			0

in 1905 a devastating typhoon swept over the @entity1 in the middle of the @entity3 , stripping it back to the bare coral
*university* of @entity166 scientists have studied aerial photographs of the atoll to track its regeneration from sandy deposits to lush islands
hoped the study will help scientists better understand how new islands are created , which is of interest as people are worried about rising sea levels
