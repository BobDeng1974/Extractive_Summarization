an ancient @entity1 scroll that was damaged by a volcanic eruption in @entity3 has been deciphered for the first time			1
using a form of x-ray imaging , scientists have been able to peer inside it without breaking the fragile papyrus			2
it is among hundreds of texts retrieved from villa at @entity13 - a town that was destroyed when @entity14 erupted 2,000 years ago			1
it takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation pass through substances			0
on one fragment ( right ) , researchers spotted words that are thought to be ' would fall ' , ' would say ' , and ' to move ' the catastrophic event was the same eruption that wiped out @entity31			1
some of the texts from what is called the @entity34 have been deciphered after being discovered in the 1750s			1
but many more remain a mystery because they were so badly damaged			1
it was feared that unrolling the papyrus they were written on would have destroyed them completely			1
the only distinct marks in documents such as this scroll , said the researchers , are rounded traces - shapes that are n't easily confused with papyrus fibres - running vertically and horizontally			1
@entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( a ) are easy to decipher			0
while @entity66 , @entity67 , i , @entity63 , @entity59 and t ( b ) are more easily confused @entity69 , a theoretical scientist at the @entity71 in @entity72 , and his colleagues used a technique called x-ray phase contrast tomography			0
it has previously been used to examine fossils without damaging them			0
phase contrast tomography takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation - such as x-rays - pass through different substances , in this case papyrus and ink			2
the only clearly distinct marks in documents such as this scroll , said the researchers , are rounded or oblique traces - shapes that are not easily confused with papyrus fibres - which run vertically and horizontally			1
for example , letters are a , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity96 , @entity63 , @entity60 and @entity64 are easy to decipher			0
while @entity66 , @entity67 , i , @entity63 , @entity59 and @entity98 are more easily confused			0
on one fragment , the sequence of @entity102 capital letters piptoie could be read , and the researchers believe it may read ' would fall			2
' in the following line , they believe it reads ' would say ' , and in a later fragment the researchers identified a sequence that could be words of the verb ' to move			1
' ' the papyri were completely covered in blazing - hot volcanic material , ' said @entity69 , a theoretical scientist at the @entity71 in @entity72 who led the latest project			2
previous attempts to peer inside the scrolls failed to yield any readable texts because the ink used in ancient times was made from a mixture of charcoal and gum			2
this makes it indistinguishable from the burned papyrus			2
the scroll is among hundreds retrieved from the remains of a villa at @entity13 , which along with @entity31 ( preserved victim pictured ) was one of several @entity136 towns that were destroyed when @entity14 ( pictured in background ) erupted in @entity3 this map shows the cities and towns affected by the eruption of @entity14			1
@entity13 is pictured to the west of the volcanoe			1
@entity31 is in the south east			0
the estimated shape of the ash and cinder is shown by the dark area covering the region @entity150 , born around 35 @entity151 , and was an @entity153 philosopher and poet			0
@entity156 philosophy , as established by @entity153 ( 341 to 270 bc ) , taught that the purpose of life was to enjoy a happy , pain - free , tranquil existence			0
it also encouraged people to surround themselves with friends and try to live self - sufficiently			0
@entity163 studied in @entity164 , before moving to @entity165 , and then to @entity13			1
he is chiefly known for his poetry preserved in the @entity167 , but since the 18th century , many writings of his have been discovered among the charred papyrus rolls at the @entity34 at @entity13			1
the task of excavating and deciphering these rolls is difficult , and work continues to this day			0
mr @entity69 and his colleagues used a technique called x-ray phase contrast tomography , which has previously been used to examine fossils without damaging them			0
phase contrast tomography takes advantage of subtle differences in the way radiation - such as x-rays - pass through different substances , in this case papyrus and ink			2
using the technology at the @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity191 , the researchers found they were able to decipher several letters in one of the scrolls , proving that the method could be used to read what 's hidden inside others			2
the only clearly distinct marks found inside the document , are rounded or oblique traces - shapes that are not easily confused with papyrus fibres - which run vertically and horizontally , the researchers said			1
for example , letters are a , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity96 , @entity63 , @entity60 and @entity64 are easy to decipher			0
while @entity66 , @entity67 , i , @entity63 , @entity59 and @entity98 are more easily confused			0
on one fragment , the sequence of @entity102 capital letters piptoie could be read , and the researchers believe it may read ' would fall			2
' some of the texts recovered from what is called the @entity34 ( ruins pictured ) have been deciphered after being discovered in the 1750s			1
but many more remain a mystery because they were so badly damaged			1
it was feared that unrolling the papyrus they were written on would have destroyed them completely the next challenge will be to automate the process of scanning the charred lumps of papyrus ( example pictured ) and deciphering the texts inside them in the following line , they believe it reads ' would say ' , and in a later fragment the researchers identified a sequence that could be words of the verb ' to move			1
' ' our goal was to show that the technique is sensitive to the writing , ' said mr @entity69			0
in a further step , the scientists compared the handwriting to that of other texts , allowing them to conclude it was likely the work of @entity150 , a poet and @entity153 philosopher who died about a century before the volcanic eruption			2
the next challenge will be to automate the process of scanning the charred lumps of papyrus and deciphering the texts inside them			1
once achieved , it will mean 700 further scrolls stored in @entity72 could be deciphered			0
scholars studying the @entity13 texts said the new technique may well mark a breakthrough for their efforts to unlock the ancient philosophical ideas hidden from view for almost two millennia			1
' it 's a philosophical library of @entity153 texts from a time when this philosophy influenced the most important classical latin authors , such as @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 , ' said @entity268 , a professor of @entity102 and @entity269 at the @entity270 , @entity271 , who was not involved in the project			0
' there needs to be much work before one can virtually unroll carbonized papyrus because one will have to develop a digital method that will allow us to follow the layers , ' he said			0
' but in the 260 years of @entity281 it is certainly a remarkable year			0
' the findings are published in the journal @entity284 .			0

the scroll was retrieved from the remains of a villa at @entity13
location was a @entity136 town destroyed when @entity14 erupted
words deciphered *include* ' would fall ' , ' would say ' , and ' to move '
some texts from @entity34 were found and deciphered in the 1750s
but many remain a mystery because they were so badly damaged that unrolling the papyrus would have destroyed them completely
