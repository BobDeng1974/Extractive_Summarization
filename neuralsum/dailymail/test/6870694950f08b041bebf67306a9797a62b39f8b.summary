it appears nowadays that it is not an official holiday until you 've uploaded your pictures to @entity5 with the intention of letting all those at home know how incredible your time away is			1
from the food you ate for dinner , to the bags you lovingly packed for the plane , every detail of our ' luxurious ' travels can be documented for social media feeds			2
however sometimes we are guilty of not showing the entire story , and the truth can paint a whole other picture			1
while you may have visions of a peaceful stroll along the historic walkway , the truth is you need to be prepared for a slightly different scenario			2
the wall attracts over 10 million visitors annually so you could be battling your way through the crowds and not just the steep inclines			2
@entity5 : private planes comes with plenty of legroom and leather interiors , making travel incredible for stars such as @entity49 reality : most of us travel with barely any legroom with hundreds of strangers and possibly screaming babies it is sad to say that flying on a private jet , and on a commercial flight are polar opposite travelling experiences			1
while it is still fun to get on a plane , with the promise of a holiday on the other side , seeing @entity5 pictures from @entity49 's luxury spacious aircraft could make us wishing we had won the lottery			1
battling with the person in front for their reclining chair not touching your lap , and craning to see the in - flight movie are all part of the fun that comes with the reality of economy flying			2
@entity5 : @entity78 snapped this close - up shot of herself right next to @entity81 's @entity80 at @entity82 , making us all believe we can get easy front - row access to the painting reality : be prepared to wade through hordes of tourists and avoid getting other cameras in your shot while visiting the @entity80 the @entity82 attracts 9.7 million visitors a year , more than any other museum in the world			1
despite @entity78 making us all believe we can just stroll up and get a front - row shot , the reality is less than rosy			2
huge crowds could be blocking the way between you and the mysterious smile , and it is an art in itself snapping the portrait without getting a few cameras in shot			2
@entity5 : @entity105 photographer @entity104 follows his stunning girlfriend to the world 's most famous sights and landmarks , including the @entity110 in @entity111 reality : walk to the other side of @entity116 's famous landmark and the traffic of the city somewhat destroys the romance @entity110 is the main entrance to the @entity116 capital of @entity111 and features a picturesque 18th - century neoclassical triumphal arch. photos posted on @entity5 show celebrities strolling up to the iconic structure			1
but what would make this landmark more appealing would be if it was not surrounded by busy road traffic , and pollution from cars			2
@entity5 : model @entity132 revealed her essentials for travel on @entity5 , perfectly laid out in the x-ray tray at customs reality : not everyone has time to arrange their ultra-stylish hand luggage items neatly as they join long queues to pass through security often travel and packing a suitcase can look effortless and sophisticated , when photographs have been carefully selected , with a tactical filter applied			1
for some , this is the norm , but for others , the sit and zip method of packing , and the rushed cram are the travel scenarios they are most accustomed to			0
we can all dream of the day we achieve the relaxed and organised packing experience			0
@entity5 : having roof access to the best partying scenes , overlooking a pool looks easy when you are @entity162 reality : battling through the crowds to get a drink , surrounded by thousands of other partygoers trying to not get a drink spilt on you attending the biggest and best parties in @entity169 is a challenge , both in getting a ticket to get inside , and surviving once you are there			1
it can look so easy on @entity5 , as @entity162 showed us , enjoying her time on the roof overlooking the pool			1
but almost all visitors are crammed onto the floor with heads obstructing their views of the @entity181 on the stage			0
@entity5 : the glorious @entity183 is resplendent , with or without an @entity5 filter and the internet is full of spectacular sunset pictures reality : unfortunately , the reality of trying to capture that all - important sunset picture is a little more crowded it is undeniable that the @entity183 in @entity191 , @entity192 , is one of the most beautiful mausoleums in the world			1
this thought is shared by the three million tourists who go to photograph the iconic landmark			0
sadly the outskirts around the temple have less attention than the marble temple , with litter collecting on the banks of the @entity205			0
@entity5 : the beautiful @entity207 statue in @entity208 looks impressive against a dramatic sky reality : if you can push past the crowds you will be able to see the mermaid , which sits at 4.1ft tall the bronze mermaid statue by sculpture @entity215 was erected on a rock at the @entity218 in @entity208 , @entity219 in 1913			1
it was based on the @entity207 fairy tale by @entity219 author @entity222 and has drawn a lot of attention over the years			0
it once had its head sawn off by politically oriented artists of the @entity229 movement in 1964 , and again by an unknown culprit in 1998			0
@entity5 : stretching out on the plane while enjoying fine cuisine such a lobster , as you soar to your luxurious holiday reality : plastic trays litter your tray table as you wait for the flight attendant to collect whatever it was you ate plane food has never had the reputation of being the best meal travellers have ever had			1
this is not helped by people snapping the first class alternative , and then applying a filter to make the lobster look even more delicious			0
sometime you ca n't complain though , and getting a meal , whatever it is like , can brighten your flight			0
@entity5 : colourful and tasty food awaits the intrepid explorer , sampling a slice of culture on their holidays reality : sometimes it is safer to eat at the hotel if you are n't sure what animal it is that is being served at the side of the street it is great to want to experience as much of another culture as you can while you are there for your visit			1
immersing yourself in the local markets and sampling the cuisine can seem like a good place to start			0
while a lot of tasty delicacies can be found , you will inevitably stumble upon a questionable dish at some stage , that will make you crave something safer			0
@entity5 : pop star @entity281 gets up close and personal with a giraffe at a zoo reality : sometimes the encounter is too close for comfort if you are lucky enough to approach an animal in an enclosure getting to see animals close up at the zoo is rare on a busy day			1
however if you do have an encounter with the animals , you could be hoping for an experience like @entity281 's , who met a giraffe and posted a snap on her @entity5 account			2
sadly sometimes the animals have other ideas and you can be faced with a less than dignified situation			0
@entity5 : girl group @entity303 posted this photo of their tour bus , which has plush leather interiors and flat - screen televisions reality : waiting in a queue of tired explorers , wondering who you will be sat next to , and praying your seat is not next to the toilet celebrities make transport seem easy , with luxurious tour buses or limousines waiting to take them to their next destination			1
for the rest of us , public coaches can be the cheapest way to reach our holidays			0
sadly stretching out with flat screen @entity326 is not the norm in this case			0
@entity5 : an exotic shot of the famous pyramids while sat on a camel for an authentic desert feel reality : take a short trip from the bustling city to see the landmarks , or see it from @entity338 , which is located nearby it is easy to give the impression of a long camel ride to the pyramids in @entity343			1
what some people do n't realise is they are actually located just on the edge of the busy city			0
furthermore , a @entity338 is located across from pyramids in @entity349 .			0

tactical filters used on the *mobile* phone app @entity5 can paint a different picture of holiday away
from the @entity183 to celebrities *hangouts* , the truth can look very different
photographs reveal the funny or stark reality behind famous tourist spots visited by millions
