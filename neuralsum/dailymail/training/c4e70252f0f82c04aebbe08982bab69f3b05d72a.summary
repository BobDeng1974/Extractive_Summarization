by @entity0 altering search results has a major effect on the voting preferences of undecided voters and could swing a close election , researchers have claimed			1
researchers analysing an @entity8 election found undecided voters paid far more attention to search rankings than previously thought			1
they say search results can alter the outcome by up to 12 % in some cases			1
researchers analysing an @entity8 election found undecided voters paid far more attention to search rankings than previously thought			1
the new study suggests that biased search rankings can be used to fix the outcome of elections in which the winner is projected to win by a margin up to 2.9 %			2
in the new study , participants were randomly assigned to groups in which search rankings favored either mr @entity26 , mr @entity27 , or mr @entity28 in the recent @entity29			0
real search rankings and web pages were used , and people were asked to research all the candidates just as they would on @entity34			2
the only difference between the groups was the order in which the search results were displayed			2
the new study suggests that biased search rankings can be used to fix the outcome of races in @entity8 in which the winner is projected to win by a margin up to 2.9 %			1
this can be done just by influencing undecided voters who use the internet – a small but important group of voters that is sure to grow in coming years			2
studies show that the higher the rank , the more people trust the result , which is why companies are spending billions now to push their products higher			0
researchers at the @entity55 in @entity56 wanted to see if the effect was similar on political candidates			0
in research conducted last year in the @entity60 , researchers found that altering search rankings so they were biased in favor of a candidate could push the preferences of undecided voters toward that candidate by 15 % or more			1
the team carried out a new study in recent weeks with more than 2,000 undecided voters throughout @entity8			1
the researchers have shown that votes in @entity8 can easily be pushed toward one candidate or another by about 12 % - double that amount in some demographic groups - enough to determine the outcomes of many close races			1
' this is a very serious matter – a real threat to democracy , ' says dr @entity78 , lead researcher in the study			0
' if two candidates were both trying to push their rankings higher , they would be competing , and that ’s fine			0
' but if @entity34 , which has a monopoly on search in @entity8 , were to favor one candidate , it could easily put that candidate in office by manipulating search rankings , and no one could counter what they were doing			1
even if without human intervention the company ’s search algorithm favored one candidate , thousands of votes would still be driven to that candidate			0
' however , @entity34 hit back at the claimed , telling @entity96 : ' providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of @entity34 's approach to search from the very beginning			1
' our results reflect what 's on the web , and we rigorously protect the integrity of our algorithms			0
' it would undermine people 's trust in our results and company if we were to change course			0

@entity34 says its ranking algorithm uses over 200 signals to give you the most relevant answers to your question - be that links to websites , a photograph , a news story , a video , a book or a direct answer			2
' we continue to finesse these algorithms and make over 800 changes a year to ensure the best results , ' the firm says			0
the average query response time is roughly a quarter of a second - with the average blink of an eye is a tenth of a @entity158 of these signals include : freshness and quality of content on the webpage synonyms of words in your search query whether the best result is a webpage , images , video , news article , etc. the number ( and quality ) of other websites linking to the particular website spell check the firm also constantly tweaks its methods , and says it made more than 890 improvements to search quality in 2013			0
overall , over 1,000 person - years have gone into developing the @entity34 search algorithm			2
source : @entity34 worldwide , the researchers say , upwards of 25 % of national elections are won by margins under 3 %			1
the study also shows that certain demographic groups are especially vulnerable			0
the voting preferences of 19 % of women over 35 were shifted in the study , as were the voting preferences of 18 % of voters who were unemployed			0
' of particular concern , ' says dr @entity195 , ' is the fact that 99 % of the people in our study seemed to be unaware that the search rankings they saw were biased			0
' that means @entity34 has the power to manipulate elections without anyone suspecting they ’re doing so			0
' to prevent undue influence , election - related search rankings need to be regulated and monitored , as well as subjected to equal - time rules			1

search ranking artificially biased as an **experiment** - and changed the preferences of undecided voters by 15 %
researchers carried out **experiment** in recent @entity8 election
fears changes to search algorithms or *hacker* attacks could influence results in close elections
calls for @entity34 's political search results to be regulated
@entity34 claims its *system* is *impartial*
