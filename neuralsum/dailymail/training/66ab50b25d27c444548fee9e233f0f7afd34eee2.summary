a @entity1 scientist who published a paper claiming ordinary cells could be turned into stem cells by bathing them in acid has today been forced to apologise after she was accused of falsifying data			1
@entity8 , 30 , choked back tears during a televised news conference packed with hundreds of reporters , but insisted she did not tamper with the data to fabricate results			1
but the company @entity8 works for says she used some incorrect images and wrongly altered another a distraught @entity30 struggled to contain her emotions during the press conference , choking back tears she has contested allegations of research malpractice made by a panel of scientists at the government - funded @entity38 , where she is employed			1
@entity8 said the company had advised her not to speak publicly about the controversy and today 's press conference , which lasted for over two hours , marks her first public appearance in weeks			1
the decision to appear was made despite doctors ' orders to stay at home after she went to hospital for treatment treatment monday			0
' i was n't able to sleep well and was feeling worse and worse , ' she said			0
' i take this responsibility severely			0
' @entity8 apologised repeatedly for using wrong images and for having altered an image in the report			1
she attributed her mistakes to inexperience and her ' limited abilities , ' and appealed to fellow researchers to continue the work			2
she added : ' the research was done accurately and the data exists to prove it so i would like to ask for your understanding that the research paper was not completed with a malicious intent			0
' despite being forced into a humiliating public apology , @entity8 stands by her research , saying she can prove the results if she is allowed back into her lab today 's appearance is the first time in two weeks that @entity8 has been seen in public , and comes despite medics warning her to stay at home @entity8 opposes pulling the report from the scientific journal in which it was published , saying that the conclusions of the report are correct even if there are mistakes in the method @entity8 said she opposes retracting the paper , published in the journal nature , because it would give the international community the impression that the whole project was incorrect			1
@entity89 , a lawyer who appeared alongside @entity8 , went through @entity91 's findings in detail and concluded with a call for a review and more investigation of the research			2
he said : ' the investigation was inadequate			0
it was carried out very quickly			0
it needs to be redone			0
' announcing its findings , @entity91 also faulted @entity8 's fellow researchers and senior staff for failing to fully verify the results in the paper			1
however , it held @entity8 solely responsible for fabricating information and other mistakes in the data			2
@entity8 said she needs access to her computer in the laboratory and to her research notebooks to be able to prove she succeeded in turning cells from spleens of newborn mice into stem cells by exposing them to a more acidic environment than they are used to			1
if replicated with human cells , the research would mark a huge leap forward in the treatment of diseases such as @entity126 â€™s , heart disease and stroke			0
in an emailed statement , company @entity91 said @entity8 had the right to appeal its findings .			2

@entity8 , 30 , accused of falsifying data in stem cell report
claimed ordinary cells could be turned into stem cells using acid
using person 's own cells to grow *organs* reduces risk of *rejection*
however @entity8 's employer says she used wrong images in report
she is accused of altering one image and making mistakes in her data
despite *challenging* claims , @entity8 forced into humiliating apology
she choked back tears today as she bowed her head in shame
