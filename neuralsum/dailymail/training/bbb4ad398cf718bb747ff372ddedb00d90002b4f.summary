by @entity0 for @entity1 there was not enough of an off - season break — there never is — but @entity5 did his best to escape from rugby on the family farm during the summer , despite @entity8 attempts to keep his mind on the day job			1
in the aftermath of @entity13 ’s tour - ending capitulation against the @entity14 in @entity15 in june , @entity5 retreated to @entity16 to catch up with relatives and unwind			1
but @entity18 is not a place to get away from the game , especially on the back of an absorbing @entity23 series			1
‘ i stayed in @entity18 after the tour to spend time with my family , ’ said @entity5 as he geared up to lead @entity25 ’s defence of their @entity27 title in the forthcoming season			1
some days i did n’t even leave the farm			2
every morning you have to feed the cows and stuff like that			0
‘ for my parents it ’s probably a chore because before they can do anything they have to tend to the animals			2
‘ it was funny because they have this rugby channel in @entity18 and every time i turned the tv on they were playing that last test ( which @entity13 lost 36 - 13 )			1
it was on all the time			0
i kind of avoided that ! ’ despite the emphatic nature of that result in the series finale at @entity64 , @entity60 ’s team made a profound impression on the @entity8 rugby public by the manner in which they stood toe - to - toe with the world champions in the first two tests			1
@entity5 was enthused by the response of people he spoke to after the tour			1
‘ what was nice for me was when i stayed out in @entity18 , the amount of positive feedback i got from @entity18 , ’ he said			1
‘ i think we raised a few eyebrows out there			0
everyone was so complimentary about the way we conducted ourselves and the rugby we played — i think we put them under a bit of pressure			0
the most disappointing thing was that we did not get a result ; not one @entity23 win			0
if we want to go up the world rankings we need to close games out			0
‘ that was the review from the summer			2
we look forward to the @entity91			0
it is a year out now			0
it ’s crazy , it is all going to happen pretty quickly			0
’ humbled : @entity13 captain @entity95 ( @entity96 ) talks to @entity5 after the capitulation to @entity18 for @entity5 and the rest of @entity25 ’s large @entity13 contingent , the more pressing priority for now is the defence of their @entity27 title , dramatically secured in the last minute of extra-time at @entity104 in may			1
soon after that glorious occasion , the hooker and several of his club mates were on their way to @entity109 , so there was precious little time for reflection			2
‘ it all went so quick , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ i did n’t get to enjoy the final as much as some of the other lads because we had to get on a plane and shoot off			2
’ the time for looking back with satisfaction has surely passed , for now			0
@entity5 returned from @entity18 via @entity121 to catch up with the same friends who had provided a haven for him when he was stewing on the ban last year which shattered his @entity127 ambitions			1
fighting spirit : @entity13 were commended for how they took the game to @entity18 in the opening two tests since then , an annual trip to the @entity133 by @entity5 and a group of @entity37 players served as the ‘ last hurrah ’ before club hostilities resume against @entity137 at @entity138 on september 5			1
@entity25 have opted to consolidate rather than recruit , but the skipper backs that strategy			2
‘ we are stable and i do n’t think we played our best rugby last season , ’ he said			2
‘ there are no excuses about new players coming in			0
we have to perform from the off and be more consistent			0
