by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 17:03 est , 20 march 2012 it 's makers had hoped it would be the next big adventure movie franchise			2
@entity5 had even planned sequels and a theme park			0
but @entity8 , an unlikely tale about an @entity11 soldier who ends up on @entity12 , is on course to lose more money than any movie in history			1
its producers admitted the film , released in the @entity20 a fortnight ago , is set for losses of more than £ 120million			0
colossal flop : science - fiction action film @entity8 has made about $ 184million in ticket sales worldwide so far			1
but box office receipts are split roughly in half with cinema owners and it cost $ 250million and a further $ 100million to promote @entity5 , which was hoping the 3d production would achieve the same success as its @entity32 series , lavished close to £ 160million making @entity8 and a further £ 63million on global marketing and advertising			1
the film features newcomer @entity36 as @entity8 along with @entity20 stars @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			2
but the company has now projected that it will lose millions after it failed to impress critics and the public alike			0
audience reviews have branded it ‘ dull ’ , ‘ pointless ’ and ‘ too long ’			0
literary origins : the movie starring model / actor @entity36 ( pictured ) was based on a series of books written by the late @entity53 , starting with @entity48 in 1912 and ending with @entity49 , published posthumously in 1964 glitzy : dame @entity55 ( left ) , who does not appear in the film , provided some a-list glamour on the red carpet at @entity8 's world premiere in @entity60 last month			1
star @entity36 ( right ) also attended this list features the films that have lost the most money , adjusted for inflation , for the @entity66 studio that bankrolled the movie			1
it does not take into account the losses suffered by the distributor and cinemas			0
if so , these figures would actually be much higher			0
the biggest money - losing films ever are : @entity78 reviewer @entity77 said : ‘ the storytelling is incomprehensible , the characterisation is ludicrous , the story is two and a quarter hours long and it ’s a boring , boring , boring two and a quarter hours long			1
’ @entity5 said @entity8 had brought in about £ 116million in ticket sales worldwide so far but it retains only £ 58million of that as the money is split equally with cinema chains			1
a spokesman confirmed : ‘ in light of the theatrical performance of @entity8 , we expect the film to generate an operating loss of approximately $ 200million ( £ 126million )			1
’ he added that its failure would mean the studio itself will lose up to £ 76million for the quarter as the profits from other films and ventures are not enough to break even			0
@entity5 would not confirm the total budget of the film as it has held the rights since 2007 and spent additional money on developing the idea			2
but industry sources have said it may need to gross more than £ 380million for the film to make all its money back			2
the poor performance of the film is a surprise , because its director , @entity106 ’s @entity105 , had previously achieved acclaim with @entity108 and @entity110 - @entity109 @entity8 is based on a series of books written by @entity53 , who also created @entity113			2
the stories follow a war veteran who finds himself transported to @entity12 and battling to save the planet ’s inhabitants			0
the series began with a princess of @entity12 in 1912 and ended with @entity49 , published after the author ’s death in 1964			0
biggest flop : pirate romp @entity123 ( 1995 ) starred @entity124 and @entity125 and lost studio @entity126 $ 147,157,68 industry experts believe @entity5 ’s figures for @entity8 make it the biggest box office disaster ever			1
but it is difficult to make comparisons as studios reveal little financial detail and allowances have to be made for inflation			0
when @entity138 ’s ambitious £ 96million epic @entity137 was released in 1995 it was condemned as the biggest film flop of all time			0
but the film went on to break even through worldwide sales and then made more money with lucrative tie - ins from a video game and theme park attractions at @entity147 in @entity66 , @entity148 and @entity149			1
@entity150 , a @entity152 movie starring @entity153 , was one of the most critically derided bombs in @entity66 history , costing £ 27.7million to make but taking only £ 2.12million when it was released in 1980 .			2

@entity5 film cost $ 250million to make and a further $ 100million to promote
movie takes just $ 184million worldwide , but half that goes to cinema owners
loss places @entity8 among @entity66 's biggest money - losers ever
