horses will also be led along a different path after the race , a decision which was made in conjunction with @entity63 chairman of @entity64			2
' traditionally horses wait for the winner to lead them down the race , but will now enter the @entity13 in the order they return , ' mr @entity49 said			2
' the larger crowds that gather for the @entity74 races will still have the opportunity to see the horses return to scale along the track			0

' the horse , which ran seventh , is clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the crowd - and shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard the horse was later put down due to the injury suffered , during @entity2 at @entity126 in @entity127 on tuesday the death of @entity9 and pre-race favour @entity17 overshadowed victory for the @entity132 - trained @entity131 , who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades , and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses			1
dr @entity138 said an autopsy was conducted for @entity17 on tuesday night at the @entity140 and initial results point to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm			2
a full post mortem with microscopic and toxicology studies will take 10 days or more , he said			0
' it 's seen in racehorses and human athletes as well - in the large mass of the muscle of the heart , the electrical current has to get through in a coordinated way , and at high heart rates sometimes that can become short circuited , ' dr @entity138 said			0
@entity17 , the pre-race favourite , finished last in the @entity2 and almost walked across the line the heartbreaking moment that @entity2 pre-race favourite @entity17 collapses and dies in the stall after the race racing @entity158 head of veterinary services and equine welfare dr @entity138 ( left ) and chairman of stewards @entity64 arrive at a press conferenceon wednesday			1

the reason for @entity9 â€™s demise was immediately clear			0
speaking shortly afterwards , his trainer @entity173 said that the stallion had become distressed by a big flag and run off			0
' they run the @entity2 for 154 years and nothing like that has happened , ' he said			0
@entity110 , racing manager at @entity173 's @entity180 stables , said the horse 's death was a ' freakish accident ' , but he anticipated the @entity6 would review how close punters are allowed to get to @entity2 horses following the race			1
' i think the @entity6 does a magnificent job , but possibly they could look at flags that close to where the horses go , ' mr @entity110 said			2
' someone had a big flag and was waving it and right at the time when our horse went passed it and they 're animals , they get spooked quite easily			2
' mr @entity110 added that it was ' not fair ' that racing was being portrayed as a cruel industry following the deaths of the two horses			0
' all care is taken for their wellbeing and their welfare and i assure you , you 've just got to talk to everybody involved and see how much love they have for the animals , ' he said			0
' now and then we do have unfortunate accidents that happen but that 's no different to any other sport			0
