blueprints for the first - ever plastic gun produced on a 3 - d printer , that can pass through metal detectors , have been downloaded over 100,000 times since it was posted to the web on monday			1
designs for the ' liberator ' pistol were posted online by @entity9 but on thursday the @entity10 ordered the website to take down the blueprints , on the basis that the plans could violate export regulations			1
the blueprints , that could be produced on @entity18 printers costing as little as $ 1,000 , were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition			2
bang : this is the moment defense distributed founder @entity26 successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a @entity18 printer surprisingly , most downloads of the plans did not come from inside the @entity31 but from @entity32			1
the @entity31 is second , ahead of @entity33 , @entity34 , and the @entity35 , according to @entity36 , a developer working with @entity9 , who reported the statistics to @entity39			1
the @entity10 @entity40 ordered @entity26 , the 25 - year - old founder of the site , to remove the online blueprints for the @entity44 ' handgun , @entity39 reported			1
the @entity10 office is reviewing whether the files violate export control laws for weapons , known as the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , since the plans were downloaded overseas			1
@entity26 , currently a law student at the @entity52 in @entity53 , says his group will comply with the @entity10 directive			2
crude : the @entity44 plastic gun is a simple single - shot weapon that fires a small .380 - caliber bullet on sunday , the group @entity9 posted a video of founder @entity26 firing the ' @entity62 ' plastic pistol			1
mr @entity26 made the schematics for the weapon available for free online this week - meaning everyone with a high - end @entity18 printer can create their own version of the gun			1
in response , @entity72 senator @entity71 announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban the weapons because they can pass through metal detectors at airports and court houses without being picked up			2
' we ’re facing a situation where anyone - a felon , a terrorist - can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable			2
it ’s stomach - churning , ' he said			0
plastic : sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the @entity44 are plastic , constructed by a @entity18 printer			2
a small nail is used for a firing pin sixteen of the 17 parts in the @entity44 pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the @entity99 3d printer			1
the final piece of the weapons - the firing pin - is a common nail			1
mr @entity26 told @entity39 that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them			0
it is a bid , he says , to keep governments accountable to the people			0
' you can print a lethal device			0
it ’s kind of scary , but that ’s what we ’re aiming to show , ' he said			0
' anywhere there ’s a computer and an internet connection , there would be the promise of a gun			0
' the name of the @entity123 - comes from a simple @entity125 pistol that was designed by the @entity31 military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied @entity129 and concentration camps			1
like its @entity125 predecessor , the @entity9 pistol is a crude weapon			2
it holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore			0
shocking : @entity72 senator @entity71 plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from @entity18 printers @entity18 printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine , to construction to aerospace			2
the process , also called additive manufacturing , creates a three - dimensional solid object from a digital model			0
the feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic			0
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			0
the machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			0
the process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s			0
however , since 2010 , an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3 - d printers , which are increasingly small , increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable			1
@entity9 used a higher - end $ 8,000 model to build its @entity18 gun			1
however entry - level desktop models can cost $ 500 to $ 1,000			0
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
engineers hope 3 - d printing will begin an era of ' instant prototyping ' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively			1
the group has successfully fired it with a .380 - caliber pistol round			0
however , an attempt to shoot a slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces			0
currently , the @entity44 can only be made through highly specialized processes on an $ 8,000 3 - d printer			1
mr @entity26 says he hopes to adapt the model the technology behind 3 - d printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades			1
it is only since about 2010 , though , that 3 - d printers have become cheap enough , simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to purchase			1
@entity71 says the accessibility of @entity18 printers makes plastic guns a security threat			0
' guns are made out of plastic , so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event , ' @entity71 said , according @entity211			2
' only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors , for instance , when you go through an airport			1
' a terrorist , someone who ’s mentally ill , a spousal abuser , a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage			0
' @entity71 wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new bill would add a ban on plastic high - capacity magazines			2
' people have made silencers , stocks , triggers and lots of other gun parts			0
they can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone with one of these printers - and the printers cost about $ 1,000 - can make one , ' @entity71 said			2
current law bans all - plastic weaponry			1
defense distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle , to get around the law			1
@entity71 says the metal can be swapped out and replaced with plastic			0
production : in an instruction video , the @entity18 printed gun is shown being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home process : video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each part was printed and cleaned			0

@entity9 posted video on sunday of founder shooting all - plastic gun made on an $ 8,000 3 - d printer
pistol uses only one metal piece - a small nail for the firing pin
blueprints for the weapons were downloaded 100,000 times in two days
most downloaded in @entity32 , then the @entity31 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and the @entity35
the @entity10 has demanded the site take down the blueprints
