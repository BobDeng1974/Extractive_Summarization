the @entity1 family - who shot to fame with the @entity4 reality series @entity3 - promotes not only abstinence until marriage , but also kissing and even hugging , which makes it incredibly shocking that the sister of patriarch @entity1 has a daughter out of wedlock			1
it seems that cousin @entity11 , who has appeared on the show and is the daughter of @entity1 's sister @entity14 , was born when her mother was not married and , what 's more , though it may seem as if her husband , @entity18 , is @entity11 's biological father , that may not be the case			1
in fact , a 2012 interview in which @entity18 said he and @entity14 had been dating for 20 years , which would be five years after @entity11 , 27 , was born , seems to confirm that he is not her father			1
and so , we dated each other on and off for quite some time , ' @entity14 said in a 2009 interview on the show , according to @entity41			2
' then we finally decided you know what , we need to get married ! so we got married , we ’ve been together 3 years			2
' the couple did wed in 2006 , and while that may seem against the @entity1 family principles , @entity1 still very much loves his sister			2
' we enjoy getting together every week			0
' @entity1 ( left ) is against even hugging beofre marriage , but still has a close relationship with @entity14 and @entity11 ( left ) @entity14 and @entity18 ( above with @entity49 ) were married in 2006 and have been together for 22 years this comes hot on the heels on the revelation that @entity53 , the matriarch of the family , has a sister who is a lesbian			1
@entity53 has never said much of the woman , @entity56 , who did appear in an early episode of the show without her partner , but her sister has called their lifestyle a cult			0
we are worried about them , ’ said her partner @entity66			0
‘ we have often thought that @entity67 is a cult			0
it appears to be brainwashing to me			0

it has been revealed that @entity1 's sister @entity14 had her daughter @entity11 out of wedlock
what 's more , it is *uncertain* who @entity11 's biological father is as she is 27 and @entity14 's has only been with her husband @entity18 for 22 years
this goes against the @entity1 family principles , where even hugging before marriage is not *allowed*
