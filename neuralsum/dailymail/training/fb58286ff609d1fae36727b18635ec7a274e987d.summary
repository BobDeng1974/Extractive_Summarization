by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 07:55 est , 14 october 2013 forget listening to music , a new slow motion video helps you see your favourite tracks by using paint to show how the sound waves move			1
@entity9 - based @entity8 , also known as @entity10 and @entity11 , poured different coloured paints onto a speaker driver cone			1
as music is played through the speaker , a video shows the the paint bouncing in time with the vibrations created by the music to give a visual representation of the track			1
when these waves hit a listener 's eardrums , it causes the drum itself to move forward and backward in a similar motion			0
this causes the person to hear the sound exactly how its being produced			0
the cone is moved using an electromagnetic process created by a coil of wire , called the voice coil , at the base of the cone			0
electrical impulses coming from the amplifier , or amplifiers , move this voice coil , which then interacts with a permanent magnet attached to the speaker â€™s cone			0
in the video , @entity52 , also known as @entity10 and @entity11 , turn the speaker of a 1980s @entity56 cassette player on its side before pouring the paints onto the speaker driver cone			2
music on a cassette tape is then played at full volume through the speakers to highlight which areas of the cone move as the song plays			2
for copyright reasons , @entity67 and @entity11 do n't play the actual song but replace it with stock audio			0
the green paint is showing rising and falling the most because , as @entity67 explains , it is the most watery , while the more viscous orange paint stays still			0
during a second test , @entity11 mixes up the various colours so that they each have a similar consistency			0
free then adds a macro lens to a @entity78 camera and shoots the paint at 2500fps to capture ' the initial blobs of paint just as they rise to the top and look cool			1
' as the speaker cone vibrates and the paint bounces , the colours mix together and form a cream colour			1
@entity9 - based duo @entity87 put paint on speakers and filmed how the liquid moved as loud music travelled through it			0
the video was shot at 2500 frames per second using a @entity78 camera			1
as the speaker cone vibrates , streams of different coloured paint bounce and gradually mix together , pictured during a second test , @entity11 mixes the colours so that they each have a similar consistency			1

video by @entity8 was filmed at 2500 fps using a @entity78 camera
it shows different coloured paints poured onto a speaker cone
music is played through the speakers to show how the cone vibrates
different coloured paints behave according to their consistency
vibrations cause the streams of paint to bounce and mix together
