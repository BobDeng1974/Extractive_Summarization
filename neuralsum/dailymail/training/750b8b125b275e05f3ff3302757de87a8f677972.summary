by @entity1 reporter published : 18:27 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 21:42 est , 9 march 2013 with a one - point lead , 2.9 seconds to play and possession of the ball , all @entity2 had to do was inbound the basketball and run out the clock to advance in the @entity10 state boys ' basketball tournament			1
but what followed stunned everyone			0
@entity14 guard @entity13 got confused after he received the inbounds pass and laid the ball into the wrong basket just before time expired			1
' when i saw the kid going that way , i was like , " no , he 's not			1
no , he 's not ... oh , yes he is , " ' @entity26 assistant coach @entity38 told @entity39			1
' i could n't believe it			0
' @entity13 needed only to dribble away the remaining seconds to wrap up a victory for @entity14			2
instead , he got turned around and dropped in a most bizarre buzzer - beater , @entity14 coach @entity43 told @entity45 on friday			2
@entity14 's celebrating fans went silent , and @entity48 fans broke out in celebration after a moment of silence for reassurance that the points - and the win - were theirs			1
' without a doubt , that 's the toughest locker room i 've ever had to talk to , ' mr @entity43 said			2
mistake : the basket seen being made by the 16 - year - old junior gave the opposing team a 38 - 37 win on thursday night and a place in the @entity28 semifinals and the 16 - year - old high school junior was tough to console , mr @entity43 said , adding that other players on the team called and texted him on friday offering their support			1
' the kid feels terrible			0
it 's still a game , regardless of what anyone says , basketball is still a game , ' mr @entity43 said			1
with the win , @entity26 advances to a semifinal matchup against two - time defending state champ , @entity78			2
' i feel sorry for him , ' mr @entity38 said of @entity13			0
' i really do feel sorry for him			0
but hey , i 'll take it			0
' mr @entity38 was n't alone in sharing @entity13 's pain			0
on friday @entity85 general manager for the @entity83 , @entity84 , personally contacted the 16 - year - old and invited him to sunday 's @entity85 game against the @entity88 , the @entity39 reports			1
@entity13 will attend as a guest of the team			0
what mr @entity84 and the student discussed remained under wraps but it could easily be assumed on line with his high school coach 's shared words with the newspaper			1
' he 's a great kid , tremendous talent , and he 'll do wonderful , wonderful things , ' he said			0

the high school junior laid the ball into the wrong basket in the final 2.9 seconds while his team was ahead by one point
