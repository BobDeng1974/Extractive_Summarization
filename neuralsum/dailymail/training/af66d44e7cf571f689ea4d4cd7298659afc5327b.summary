@entity10 , who lives in @entity11 , @entity12 , won miss @entity13 2013 , wants to use her position to let other voluptuous women know that ' you do n't have to be size zero to be a model , and you can be pretty and plus size at the same time '			1
and the size 18 former nail technician student is now hoping to hang up her apron ( just some of the time ) , and focus on a more glittering and less greasy career on the catwalk			2
@entity10 has worked in her family chippy , @entity28 , for years , and has no plans to hang up her apron just yet , even though she will be spending more time focusing on her career as a plus - size model she said : ' to go from the chippy to the catwalk is a strange way to do it , but i 'm so glad that i entered and the win came as a total surprise			1
' my confidence has grown over the years and hopefully i can inspire other plus - size girls to be confident in their own skin			2
' i wanted to show that you do n't have to be a stick thin model to take part in a beauty contest			1
' @entity10 , who was born in @entity11 and is part @entity44 , beat a string of contestants from around the country in the preliminary rounds , then triumphed in a series of catwalk shows and interviews at the final in @entity54 last saturday			1
speaking about why she entered the curvy girl contest , @entity55 explained that she ' wanted to show that you do n't have to be a stick thin model to take part in a beauty contest ' she first entered an online competition to represent miss @entity62 2013 and was then selected by panel of judges to represent the town at the national finals			1
' i was browsing @entity68 one night in january and saw the event , read the instructions , uploaded a photo and thought " why not " , so i gave it a go and did n't think anything of it , ' @entity10 said			2
' the next thing i know i get a phone call saying i 'd been selected and they wanted me to come for an interview - and it was a whirlwind from there			0
' the girls were put into small groups to practice and perform four routines , each with their own concept and costume change			0
@entity89 included wearing colours of the @entity92 flag , wearing your own style , beach - wear and evening dress			0
' i was bullied in school for being curvy but used to laugh it off , and now i am using my size to my advantage and my confidence has only grown stronger ' @entity10 , who is a size 16 in tops and size 18 in bottoms , began working at her family 's fish and chip shop , @entity28 , around three years ago and admits she loves her food			1
' my mum @entity108 and dad @entity109 's fish and chip shop has been in the family for years , ' she said			1
' i began university after college doing beauty therapy and studying to be a nail technician , but quit and began working in the chippy			0
' i love being in the shop and can see me being there for years to come			0
it definitely not the most glamorous job in the world , but the regulars make it a great place to be			0
i get the glamour side of my life out at the modelling pageants			0
' plus - size modelling is never something i 'd ever thought about but now it 's something i would love to get into			2
i 've got aspirations to model for @entity130 or @entity131			0
' i think i was born with the big bum gene from @entity44 , it 's definitely been passed down to me ! ' my 16 - year - old sister @entity134 is completely the opposite			1
she is really petite and has loved her dancing and fitness since an early age and it 's a totally different complexity			2
' @entity10 only entered the competition casually after finding an advert on @entity68 in january , but says she has no plans to give up working in her parents ' fish and chip shop just yet @entity10 said she wants to use her win to inspire young girls who have concerns about their weight to be more confident and not to let anything stand in the way of their dreams , having herself struggled with her weight and bullies while in school			1
she said : ' i really wanted to hammer home that you do n't have to be so small to be a model , you can be pretty and plus size at the same time			0
' if i can give girls who struggle with their weight the confidence that everyone is beautiful in their different ways , inside and out , then that is great for me			2
' i put on a bikini for the first time only last year on holiday , and i have always loved food , but my motto to bullies is " if you do n't like it , do n't look " , it 's as simple as that ! ' i was bullied in school but used to laugh it off , and now i am using my size to my advantage and my confidence has only grown stronger			1
' after battering the competition from all over the country , @entity10 revealed that she is ' proud to represent curvy women all over @entity92 and to prove you do n't need a glamorous job to enter a pageant ' as well as her crown and sash , @entity10 also won a @entity187 handbag , jewellery , cash and a photo - shoot in @entity191 in august , as well as a bouquet of red , white and blue flowers			1
she said : ' it is looking to be an exciting year ahead			0
the previous winner said i would go on to shoot for papers and magazines , and do tv appearances and events			0
