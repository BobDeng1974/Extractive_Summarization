thousands of holidaymakers face up to three days of chaos and cancelled flights because of a strike by @entity5 air traffic controllers			1

experts fear up to half of all flights between the @entity16 and @entity5 could be axed , depending on how strongly the strike holds			1
delays : @entity6 is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by @entity5 air traffic controllers over the next three days ( file photo ) families returning from their @entity25 holidays and those hoping for a last - minute break will be worst affected			1

the airline urged all passengers going to @entity5 to check the status of their flight online before they travel			1
@entity7 said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the @entity16			1
a spokesman said : ' early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within , to and from @entity5 and who also use @entity5 airspace for over flights			1
' we are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from @entity5 as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike			1
' unfortunately there will be some knock - on delays to other parts of our short - haul network as a result of the strike action , given how much airspace in @entity75 will be affected			2
we are sorry for any disruption to customers ' travel plans			0
' @entity79 said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to @entity43 from @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 as well as some flights from @entity87			0
adding to the possible chaos , tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving @entity16 and pass on their details to the @entity94			2
chaos : @entity42 , pictured , and other @entity5 hubs will be severely affected by the strike the strike has been called because the @entity5 air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western @entity75			2
the walk - out is one of a series planned this month , with more industrial action from april 16 to 18 and another walk - out between april 29 and may 2			0

@entity124 subsidiary @entity123 ! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from @entity120 , and 40 per cent of services at other @entity5 airports			2
@entity16 's @entity129 , which controls the airspace over the @entity16 , said : ' we 've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules			0
' if it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around @entity5 airspace			2
that shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west ( @entity147 ) and east ( @entity148 and @entity149 )			0
' a spokesman for the @entity151 said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an ' unforeseen circumstance ' outside the control of airlines			0

we sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the @entity184 and @entity5 authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption			2
