by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 13 september 2013 this @entity2 biker has made the most of his @entity4 - using the clunky cycle to do wheelies , tricks and grinds			1
in this amazing footage , professional rider and bike shop owner @entity8 does several impressive tricks around the streets of @entity13			1
after picking up his bicycle on @entity15 and @entity16 , the biker does an almost impossibly long wheelie down a deserted street			0
afterwards , he rides off along a road before doing a bunny hop			0
later , the talented rider takes his feet off the pedals and places them on the handle bars , before reclining back with his arms outstretched			0
@entity21 can then be seen in a skate park doing jumps , spins and grinds			1
relaxing : @entity21 strikes a pose on the @entity4 bike let the games begin : the pro rides around the edge of the skate park before jumping up onto a different level flying high : the biker gets some air off a ramp in a skate park @entity65 moves ! @entity21 performs a grind in a skate park impressive : in one particularly amazing clip , the pro jumps over a bench towards the end of the video , he is joined by fellow bikers on @entity74			1
but @entity21 does n't let his clunky bike hinder him - speeding round steep corners and over bumps			2
finally , he finishes by parking the bike back in the docking station where he started			0
in a comic twist , he then presses the ' service ' button to make sure the bike is looked over after his ride			0
the footage has now been uploaded on several websites and has been shared several hundred times			0
@entity89 was asked to test the bike out in the unusual way by online magazine , animal @entity13			1
fans of the video today reacted to the footage on @entity97 , saying it was the ' coolest thing ever '			0
keeping up : @entity21 is met by other @entity2 riders , who race around a dirt track round the bend : the biker scales some sharp turns on the track lift : the biker takes his feet of the pedals during one jump one , @entity108 , said : ' @entity109 @entity8 = the coolest thing that will ever happen to bikesharing ' another , @entity111 , said : ' @entity8 is the best ' as well as being a professional rider , @entity21 owns @entity115 bike shop @entity113 - the first @entity2 specific shop in the city with friend , @entity118			1
ca n't resist : @entity21 does another wheelie in front of some graffiti back to the start : the rider docks the bike before pressing the ' service ' button he also innovated a unique street style of riding called ' @entity131 ' , several videos of which are on @entity132			1
the @entity133 were launched in @entity13 in may			2
they are usually used by tourists and locals to get them from a to b and can be hired for a day , week or a year from stations around the city			0
but , much like the so - called ' @entity139 ' in @entity140 , they are heavy , clunky and slow - especially in comparison to the high - end @entity142 @entity21 would usually perform tricks on .			2
