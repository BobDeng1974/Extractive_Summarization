by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has blamed down - sizing and cost cutting for @entity4 ’s failure to reach the @entity5			1
the @entity7 winger left @entity8 for @entity9 in a £ 9.5million deal in 2010			1
in an outspoken appraisal , however , the @entity12 international says his former club have paid a heavy price for delaying their investment in new signings			2
dejected : @entity18 sees a chance go begging as @entity4 crashed out of the @entity5 to @entity20 backlash : supporters gathered outside the stadium to make their feelings known fan fury : security staff were called in to keep an eye on the protest ‘ it ( @entity5 failure ) is a big blow for the club and obviously the people who hold the purse strings at the club , ’ said @entity2 , ‘ but i suppose you get what you pay for in the end if you decide to downsize , cut costs , and do n’t pay three , four of five million pounds for players anymore			1
‘ then you ca n’t really expect to get into the @entity5 but that ’s just the way it is at the minute i think			0
’ a lifelong @entity4 fan @entity2 has established himself in the @entity44 first team , but admits to keeping a close eye on the fortunes of the @entity8 club			1
a first team player under @entity49 and @entity50 , the 28 - year - old admits he had never heard of coach @entity52 before his appointment			1
former favourite : @entity2 , pictured in his @entity4 days , has spoken out over the state of his boyhood club ‘ i do n’t know the new manager			2
i ’ll be honest , i never heard of him before he came in			0
i was expecting they would put someone in there who is a bit more well known , someone with more pedigree			0
‘ they started off okay i suppose but things just are n’t going right at the minute			0
obviously it ’s a combination of everything because you ’ve got fans venting frustration at the board for not spending money and then it seemed that every player who was coming in was a loan signing			0
‘ i still watch all the games i can and obviously want the team to do well			0
it ’s disappointing to see the team doing poorly - but i still think they ’ll win the league easily enough			2
