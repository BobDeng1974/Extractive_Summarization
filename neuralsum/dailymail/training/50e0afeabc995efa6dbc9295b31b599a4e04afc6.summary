under fire : rev @entity1 has been criticised by some of her parishioners for placing a bumber sticker reading : ' @entity5 ' on her car when the @entity7 bought a bumper sticker for her car , she wanted something that would catch people ’s attention			1
but perhaps she did not envisage the unholy row that her choice would one day provoke			2
for seven years the noted opera librettist and wife of a distinguished poet drove around happily with the sticker bearing the letters @entity5 ? on the back of her red @entity20			1
now , however , someone in her rural parish has complained after realising that the letters stand for @entity24 ? the offended parishioner took a photograph of the 54 - year - old @entity28 - born vicar driving in her car and sent it to the local newspaper along with an anonymous letter quoting the @entity32 ’s prohibition of swearing			1
yesterday , miss @entity1 , rector in the @entity34 and the @entity36 parish in @entity37 , was unrepentant about the sticker and said her detractors should ‘ get a life ’			1
‘ f * * * is not a blasphemy , it ’s a vulgarity , an @entity48 word , ’ said @entity41 , who is married to sir @entity42 , professor of poetry at the @entity43			1
‘ my bishop knows i have the sticker on my car , and has no difficulty with it , and i ’ve had the former archbishop of @entity55 in my car , @entity57 , and he did n’t raise an eyebrow			1
’ the parishioner , quoting from @entity59 , had written to the newspaper : ‘ the @entity32 says : “ but above all do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath , but let your yes be yes and your no be no , so that you may not fall under condemnation ”			2
’ miss @entity1 said she has no intention of using the f - word in the pulpit			1
‘ the sticker is urging people to just wake up and take notice , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity75 that i ’m preparing to teach on this week is the one where @entity76 says he comes not to bring peace but the sword			0
i ’ve never had a complaint about it before			0
' i would suggest that anyone who thinks it is inappropriate should get out a little more			0
‘ the important distinction to be made is with taking the name of the @entity87 in vain and the common vulgarities			0
‘ i would n’t use language like that in church			0
but that ’s why i have it on the back of my car – it ’s a different context			0
' harmless ' : dr @entity1 said f * * * is not a blasphemy and is just an old @entity48 word cause of the complaints : the bumper sticker reading @entity5 stands for ' @entity24 ? ' ‘ and i would say also that @entity76 came to save us and not to make us genteel			1
‘ people have a lot of time on their hands right now			0
i think somebody must have had a lot of energy , animus and busybody - like qualities to photograph this			0
‘ you want to say “ for heaven ’s sake – get a life ”			0
’ the @entity118 @entity117 , @entity119 of @entity120 , said last night that he saw no problem with the sticker			2
he said : ‘ it sounds like the @entity7 has responded in all good conscience to the criticism of this anonymous newspaper reader			0
support : rev @entity1 claims the former archbishop of canterbury dr @entity57 has accepted a lift in her car and did n't raise an eyebrow about her bumper sticker controversial : rev @entity1 has previously sparked controversy in @entity28 after writing an opera about the murder of a disabled @entity137 man by @entity139 terrorists ‘ perhaps a way forward may be for the vicar and the reader to meet together to discuss it further			1
‘ @entity144 has a long tradition of open debate where people can bring their differing views and share their perspectives			0
’ miss @entity1 is a former chaplain at @entity150 , @entity120 , and wrote the libretti for @entity28 composer @entity154 ’s operas @entity152 and the politically controversial the death of @entity156 , about the murder of a disabled @entity137 man by @entity139 terrorists			1
dr @entity57 ’s secretary said yesterday that he was on holiday and unavailable for comment .			2

*reverend* @entity1 put the sticker on her red @entity20
some *members* of her parish in @entity37 were offended by the motto
dr @entity1 claims it is harmless and says ' f * * * ' is ' an @entity48 word '
