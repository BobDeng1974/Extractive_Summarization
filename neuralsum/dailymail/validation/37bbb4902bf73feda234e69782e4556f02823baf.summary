@entity1 captain @entity0 was made to warm up toilets seats early in his career for then - skipper @entity4			1
@entity0 revealed his duties as a young player included cleaning @entity4 's boots and making hot drinks for senior players at @entity1 's old @entity12 training ground - a far cry from the facilities the club 's youngsters enjoy at their world - class @entity17 base now			1
but easily the strangest thing that @entity0 did to impress was make sure the likes of @entity4 , @entity21 and @entity22 did not have to sit on cold toilet seats			1
@entity0 may be @entity1 captain now , but when @entity4 was skipper and @entity0 was a junior player at the club , his duties included warming toilet seats for senior players , making drinks and cleaning boots @entity0 ( left ) warmed up toilet seats for @entity4 and his senior @entity1 team - mates as a young player and would receive £ 25 from @entity4 every time the former captain scored while wearing boots cleaned by @entity0 @entity0 grew from a young player to a senior member of the side during training sessions at @entity12 ' i 'd do anything for them , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'd make their teas and coffees , even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground			2
it 's bizarre when you think about it but that was part of growing up			2
' @entity0 , now earning around £ 150,000 - a - week as one of @entity1 's key players , used to take a tip of £ 25 from @entity4 whenever the feisty midfielder scored with the boots @entity0 had cleaned			1
' i used to clean his boots and he wanted them perfect so i took really good care of them , ' @entity0 told @entity65			1
' every now and then he gave me a little bonus			0
every time he scored i was on £ 25 , which was half my wages at the time ! i used to be praying we 'd get a penalty or he 'd score			1
' @entity71 , @entity4 and @entity0 ( @entity72 ) pose in @entity1 kit ahead of an @entity75 launch back in 2001 @entity4 's boots were cleaned by @entity0 and he used to give his eventual successor as captain a £ 25 tip but @entity0 could not just rely on his toilet - warming skills to get him noticed by the senior players			1
' i would go in and win tackles against first team players , and i remember at the time people were going , “ ooh , you ca n’t do that " , ' he said			1
' sometimes , the foreign guys especially , did n’t like it			0
@entity88 , once , he got me round the throat , and said “ what do you think you ’re doing ? ! ” ' the first one over , to back me up , was @entity92 : “ if you ’ve got something to say , you say it to me , not the younger players			2
” me and @entity88 laugh about it now			0
' @entity0 also revealed how current manager @entity96 prevents complacency from creeping in			2
' sometimes you 're losing a game at half - time , which does n't happen often at this club , and you expect to come in and get a rollicking , ' @entity0 said			1
' but you come in and the manager is calm , collected , the complete opposite			0
he 's like , " listen , we 're going to win the game			2
we 're going to get an early goal " and he talks you through it			0
' while @entity96 's calmer side has been used to get his team through difficult periods , such as when they were drawing 2 - 2 with @entity112 at half - time on sunday after taking an early two - goal lead , he can also operate at the other end of the scale			2
' other times you 'll be winning 2 - 0 or 3 - 0 and you 'll come in happy at half - time and he 'll go ballistic			0
' tables will go over , bottles of water will go flying			0
you think " where 's that come from ? " ' but you go out for the second half and win the game 5 - 0 rather than scraping through 3 - 1 , 3 - 2			0
' he knows when players take their foot off the gas			0
he can sense something before the game			0
he just gets a feel for everyone and every single game			0
and i look at that and think no one else has got that that i ’ve experienced			0
' @entity0 says @entity88 was not pleased with the way @entity0 went around tackling the seniors in training @entity0 is now @entity1 's longest - serving player but youngsters do not have to do what he used to do the @entity1 captain has led his side to the top of the @entity146 this season			1

@entity0 has given an *insight* into his time as a young player at @entity1
@entity0 's duties used to include warming up toilet seats for senior players
he also made hot drinks for star players and cleaned @entity4 's boots
@entity161 captain used to hope that @entity4 would score to earn him a £ 25 tip
