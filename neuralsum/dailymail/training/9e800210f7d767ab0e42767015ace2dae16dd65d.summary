the pilot of the missing @entity2 flight killed himself and his passengers by switching off the oxygen supply in what is the sixth example of such a suicide , according to an aviation expert			1
@entity8 , head of @entity9 , believes @entity10 planned mass murder - locking his co-pilot out of the cockpit , depressurising the cabin and shutting down all communication links before turning the plane around			1
having examined all other possibilities , mr @entity8 insists that @entity10 , 53 , is responsible for the deaths of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board the doomed @entity23 flight , which disappeared on march 8			1
he said : ' there is a fundamental desire to ignore the mental health issue in the aviation industry			0
' our research indicates there have been five previous incidents of murder / suicide in commercial flights over the last three decades or so , accounting for 422 lives			0
' the sad addition of @entity2 would bring that number to 661			2
' ' mentally ill ' : the book claims the most likely scenario is that pilot @entity10 ( above ) deliberately depressurised the cabin then flew for another three hours before ditching into the sea although oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the seats , the passengers ' supply was limited to just 20 minutes			1
people unable to grab a mask , such as those sleeping , would have passed out within the space of a few minutes			2
the entire ' ghost plane ' - including her cabin crew whose air supply is only marginally longer , would have slipped into a coma and died shortly after from oxygen starvation			1
@entity10 , who locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit , survived long enough - either by repressurising the aircraft or from breathing his own , more extensive air supply - to evade radar and ' execute his master plan ' , mr @entity8 has concluded			1
the @entity9 chief says he then made eight different course changes before allowing the jet to fly on auto - pilot for its final few hours			2
he then performed a controlled ditching in the sea , which would explain why no debris has been found because the plane landed and sank in one piece			1
the theory is the result of the first independent study into march 's disaster by the @entity38 - based air accident investigator , @entity8			1
mr @entity8 , the founder of @entity9 and a commercial pilot himself , arrived at the shocking conclusion after considering ' every conceivable alternative scenario '			1
however , he has not been able to provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory			0
an earlier report from the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) also concluded that passengers may have died from hypoxia			2
and @entity104 authorities previously named @entity10 as their prime suspect			2
the remarkable claims are made in the book ' @entity108 ' , the culmination of a four - month study into the incident , which @entity8 co-wrote with the @entity38 broadsheet journalist , @entity26			1
@entity8 , a qualified transport safety investigator , said : ' one of our objectives in writing this book was , in some small way , to convey the human stories of the tragedy			2
' our other , more important task was to pursue the truth about what really happened ; that is one small contribution we felt we could make to this whole , terrible affair			0
' we could never have foreseen the information we uncovered , or their implications			0
' neither could we have imagined the horrific scenario that our research suggests took place on board that fateful plane			0
' @entity8 and @entity26 's entire scenario makes for difficult reading			2
search continues : officials claim they are ' making progress ' as they continue to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane			0
the orange line indicates ' high priority ' search areas ; the yellow has been searched already they believe that @entity10 , who they have concluded was suffering from mental illness , tricked his co-pilot , father - of - three , @entity147 , into taking a break about 40 minutes after take - off			1
after locking @entity147 out of the cockpit , @entity10 made his last broadcast to air traffic control - ' @entity152 , @entity104 370 ' - before switching off the aircraft 's air - to - ground communication links			1
alone at the controls , he took @entity2 up to 39,000 feet and de-pressurised the aircraft , giving passengers and crew less than 60 seconds of @entity159 ( @entity160 )			0
@entity10 could not have prevented the plane 's oxygen masks from automatically dropping down or an automated emergency announcement in @entity164			1
but @entity2 was a night flight and , with the cabin lights off , the majority of passengers would have been asleep , or close to it			2
and for 227 of the 239 passengers , @entity164 was not their first language			0
cabin crew would have tried to help those on board , but would have had to have donned their own facemasks first			0
international effort : @entity178 's deputy prime minister @entity177 unveiled the latest search plan at a press conference in @entity181 earlier this month			0
the government has contracted a new firm to take up the search ' it would have been a frightening and confusing time throughout the cabin , ' @entity26 said			0
' by the time some of the passengers had woken up groggy , heard the commotion and looked around in confusion , it would have been too late for them			0
' those passengers who did not react within 60 seconds or less would have lapsed into unconsciousness and death would have followed within four to six minutes			2
' those who had found a mask would have had between 12 and 22 minutes of breathing time before blacking out			0
the cabin crew 's oxygen supply would have lasted for about 70 minutes , depending upon the height of the aircraft			1
by the time @entity2 returned to cruising altitude , everyone on board would have perished			0
@entity10 would have had three hours ' worth of oxygen - plenty enough , the authors believe , to carry out the ' final act of his performance '			1
they conclude that he set a course for the southern @entity31 and , after the fuel ran dry , glided the aircraft for a further 100 nautical miles before performing a controlled ditching on the surface of the water			0
@entity8 , a trained commercial pilot , said : ' @entity10 was a man known for his methodical , thorough nature , for his love of the technical , and probably for his ego , too			1
' this would have been his final sad act to his family and to the world : " find this one "			0

@entity8 claims @entity225 deliberately depressurised cabin
oxygen masks would only have given passengers 20 minutes ' supply
in new book , says @entity10 was mentally ill and locked his co-pilot out of cockpit
@entity10 ' then landed on water so plane sank in one piece with no debris '
*alarmingly* , mr @entity8 says this has happened six times - causing 661 deaths
