two @entity1 ex-soldiers who travelled to @entity2 to fight the @entity3 have told how they want revenge for the execution of aid worker @entity6			1
@entity7 , 26 , and @entity8 , 24 , are helping @entity10 @entity9 defend the embattled city of @entity12 from the terror group			1
speaking from the front line , mr read , from @entity16 , said he believed @entity17 was ' the biggest threat the world faces ' and felt compelled to act even though his family had concerns			1
' killing the aid worker was the final straw , ' he said			2
taxi driver mr @entity6 , 47 , was killed by a masked militant known as @entity26 in a video released online in october following a string of similarly publicised killings			1
' but i 'm a firm believer that if you want to do something you have to do it and not just talk about it			2
' mr @entity7 , from @entity49 , said : ' i wanted to help			1
the situation in @entity52 is getting bad in terms of the support @entity17 get			1
' the world needs to open its eyes to the threat they pose			1
' mr @entity8 had a brief stint in the @entity61 , the @entity63 's regiment , while mr @entity7 served three tours of @entity65 , the paper said			1
brave : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) with other foreign volunteers who have joined a @entity10 @entity69 group called the @entity70 of @entity71 brothers in arms : @entity8 , right , with @entity75 @entity74 , who is also fighting in @entity2 the pair hit the headlines last month when it was revealed they had travelled to the war - torn country to join a band of foreign fighters known as the @entity70 of @entity71			1
they were accused of acting as mercenaries , but they insist they are not being paid and are simply involved in a war of ' good against evil '			0
photographs posted on @entity90 show the pair on the @entity2 front line dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles , posing in bullet - scarred buildings			2
on the website of the security firm they founded , mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 said they were motivated by ' conscience ' , not money , to travel to the warzone ' to assist innocent people in the face of terror from @entity17 '			1
insisting they were volunteer fighters , not guns for hire , the ex-servicemen said they would ' not do nothing while innocent men , women and children are tortured and murdered by @entity3 while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill '			0
they add : ' this is not a religious war nor is it a racial war , this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity			0
' but mr @entity8 's mother said she was not happy that her son had travelled to @entity71 – known as @entity71 – to fight the @entity127 extremists			1
speaking from her family home in @entity129 , @entity130 , 43 , said : ' he 's been in touch to say he 's okay , but i do n't like the fact that he 's gone there			0
it 's his life , but he 's my son			0
' mr @entity7 , from @entity136 , @entity49 , said he had served in the infantry for five years , including three tours of @entity65 , before leaving earlier this year			1
mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity139 , @entity140 , said in an online cv that he had been in the @entity142 for three years , specialising in reconnaissance , before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies			1
in august , the friends set up the @entity146 , a security company with the intention of providing ' specialist intelligence and surveillance services ' , and building up detailed information about terror groups			0
the firm 's motto is : ' we will go where the rest fear to go '			0
on @entity90 , mr @entity8 describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with @entity17 jihadists			1
@entity1 taxi driver @entity6 was kidnapped last @entity161 while delviering aid for a local charity he wrote that the 's * * * hit the fan ' , prompting @entity74 , 28 , a @entity75 veteran wounded fighting with the @entity166 who is understood to have recruited the @entity1 , to reply : ' it 's always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head			1
' @entity172 , a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families , said : ' they are not being paid			0
they are not participating for any commercial gain			0
' on the other side of the battle lines , official figures suggest more than 500 @entity1 have travelled to fight for @entity17 in @entity2 and @entity181			1
@entity17 has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of @entity75 journalists @entity185 and @entity187 , @entity75 aid worker @entity188 and @entity1 aid workers @entity189 and mr @entity6			1
footage appearing to show mr @entity6 's murder appeared on the internet just days after the @entity1 joined @entity75 - led air strikes against the terrorists in @entity181			1
security services have also been attempting to uncover the identity of @entity26 , who appears to speak with a @entity1 accent			1
the @entity198 has warned against travelling to @entity2 and said anyone who did so was putting themselves in ' considerable danger '			0
a spokeswoman said at the time : ' the best way to help the people of these countries is to donate to registered charities that have ongoing relief operations , not by taking part in a conflict overseas , which can be an offence under both criminal and terror laws			0
' people who commit , plan and support acts of terror abroad and seek to return to the @entity1 will be prosecuted by the @entity1 authorities			0
whether a prosecution for an offence is justified in an individual case is a matter for the @entity222 to decide after a full police investigation			0
' last month the government announced a number of new anti-terror measures designed to combat the risk of @entity229 radicals returning to @entity1 , including blocking suspected fighters entry to the @entity1			0
they call themselves the @entity70 and boast : ' it is better to live one day as a @entity234 that a thousand days as a sheep			0
' they are the foreign fighters who have travelled to @entity2 to fight , not for jihad , but on behalf of the @entity10 communities who are defending their communities from the advance of @entity242			0
just as hundreds of young @entity243 have gone to fight for the radical islamists of @entity3 , so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies , the @entity166			1
a photo shared on the @entity70 of @entity90 page this week showed @entity249 ( bottom left ) , @entity8 ( top , second from left ) , @entity252 ( bottom right ) and @entity254 posing alongside an unidentified man ( top , second from right ) , @entity259 ( top left ) and @entity75 ( top centre ) @entity74 , a former @entity75 soldier now with @entity260 ( @entity261 ) , operates @entity262 openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight			2
just as many of the @entity3 's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of @entity269 youth worldwide , many of the initial @entity261 volunteers have come from the @entity10 diaspora			0
in august a hairdresser from @entity274 was reported to be the first @entity259 to travel to fight alongside @entity10 forces			0
ethnic @entity10 @entity276 from @entity277 , 26 , travelled to @entity181 to join the @entity10 peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt @entity3 's lightning advance			0
but since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against @entity3 , perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the @entity10 autonomous region of @entity71			0
inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist @entity286 it has adopted a vision of ' libertarian municipalism ' calling for @entity166 to create free , self - governing communities			1
last month it was reported that a currently serving @entity1 marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with @entity10 militias during his leave			0
the 22 - year - old @entity296 was quizzed after he prepared to fly from @entity298 on a one - way ticket to @entity300			2
he was suspected of being in contact with @entity10 militant groups			0
two women , @entity304 , 31 , and @entity305 , 20 , have also reportedly travelled to fight with the @entity166 , inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against @entity3 terrorists			2
it is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict			2
there are also claims that a number of @entity243 biker gangs have travelled to @entity2 and are helping to assist the resistance			2
leaders of the @entity322 - based @entity321 , which has strong @entity10 links , have posted images of their @entity326 riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons			2
the news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the @entity332 were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to @entity334 to join the fight against @entity17 .			2

@entity7 and @entity8 are helping @entity166 defend city of @entity12
mr @entity8 , 24 , said he believed @entity17 was ' the biggest threat the world faces '
