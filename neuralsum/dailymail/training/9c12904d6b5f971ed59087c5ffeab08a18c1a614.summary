@entity0 is used to a frosty reception from football fans but even he struggled with the @entity4 - like conditions as @entity5 hosted @entity6 on @entity7			1
@entity8 came a day late at @entity9 as the snow fell heavily in the @entity11 during the @entity5 ' @entity13 encounter against the @entity14			0
and while the visitors got the perfect festive gift with goals from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 sealing a 3 - 1 win , @entity0 would have wished @entity22 brought him some extra layers to wear as he refereed proceedings			1
@entity0 had to referee in @entity4 - like conditions as @entity6 won 3 - 1 at @entity5 thick snow descended upon the @entity9 during the @entity7 encounter making visibility hard at times @entity0 tucks his hands under his armpits for warmth during the freezing conditions on @entity7 the 39 - year - old was left visibly shivering as he officiated the match much to the amusement of @entity6 star @entity37			1
@entity37 , a second half substitute , enjoyed a light - hearted joke during the game with @entity40 as the snow descended thicker in the second half with the ball barely visible at times			0
and despite the difficult conditions , @entity40 's judgement was spot on as he awarded @entity49 's side an early first half penalty after @entity20 was fouled by former team - mate @entity51			0
@entity19 stepped up to the spot and duly converted to put @entity6 2 - 0 ahead on 13 minutes			0
@entity0 who is likely to officiate a top - flight match on sunday , will be hoping to do so in warmer conditions than the @entity7			2
