by @entity0 the mystery over the appearance of envelopes stuffed with cash arriving at people ’s homes deepened yesterday when more beneficiaries came forward			1
three people were known to have received the windfalls through the post , all sent second class and with the address written in the same spidery handwriting			2
the only link appeared to be that they live , or had lived , in the same street in @entity17			2
shock : @entity19 , 58 , said she has been ¿ going crazy ¿ trying to work out who would want to send her £ 200 but another three – all from different roads in the town – have received cash			1
a total of £ 1,200 has been handed out in the past few weeks			2
@entity26 has had two letters – the first with £ 200 and the second with £ 100			1
the 75 - year - old lives in @entity30 , two miles from @entity31 where the acts of generosity first came to light			2
he said : ‘ it really is a mystery			0
there is no way of tracking it			0
‘ i used to work in the building trade so i thought it could have been an old customer but i ca n’t think of anyone			0
’ @entity43 , 76 , a former soldier who moved to the garrison town in 1979 and later became a contracts manager , found £ 200 on his doormat in @entity47			1
‘ it would be nice to find out who it is – it would put my mind at rest , ’ he said			0
‘ i do so many favours for people and i have been told by elderly people i ’ve done bits for “ when i die , i ’ll leave you something ”			0
’ another £ 200 was sent to @entity60 , 68 , of @entity61			1
@entity62 , 86 , who received the cash in £ 20 notes , said the only link between the three recipients was that they had all lived in the road the retired electrical engineer said : ‘ my real name is @entity70 but the letter was addressed to @entity60 , so it made me think it was someone who knows me			1
‘ it definitely looks like an elderly person ’s writing – i have n’t got a clue who it is			0
i do n’t know what the link is			0
’ the first person to receive the money was retired office worker @entity62 , 86 , who got £ 100 early last month			1
she lives around 50 yards away from @entity19 , 58 , who was given £ 200			1
mrs @entity19 ’s brother - in - law , @entity84 , who was gifted £ 200 , used to live next door to her until 1979 when he moved to @entity86 , a village a few minutes away			1
the mystery deepened when mrs @entity89 s brother - in - law , who used to live in @entity31 , was sent £ 200 checks by the @entity92 revealed the letters appear to have been posted somewhere in a fairly wide radius around @entity95			1
but there appears to be no other part of the puzzle that links the different people together , other than that they live in @entity17			0
mrs @entity62 said yesterday : ‘ none of the new names ring a bell with me at all			2
i do n’t think even @entity104 could solve this mystery			0
’ @entity106 said that cash should not be posted using the standard delivery service .			0
