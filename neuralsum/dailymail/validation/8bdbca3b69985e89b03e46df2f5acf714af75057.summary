the giant , weird testicles and penis are not even anatomically correct … that is my issue			0
' @entity12 acknowledged saturday that he did feel like something was a bit off after he installed the bull			1
' it did n't even look ( right ) , it was in the shape of a cone — but i do n't know what a weenie on a bull is supposed to look like , ' @entity12 said			1
