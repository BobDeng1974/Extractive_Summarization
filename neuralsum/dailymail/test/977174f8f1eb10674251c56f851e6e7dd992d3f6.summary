rare and valuable pieces of meteorite have fallen to @entity3 from a gigantic fireball that lit up the skies over @entity6 and @entity7 , experts say			1
the fireball was captured on camera on sunday by the @entity6 @entity10 ( @entity11 ) in @entity12 , @entity13			1
footage shows it glowing brightly as it races northwards towards the @entity16			2
@entity26 from @entity27 told @entity28 : ' this event was so bright that a piece or pieces may have survived the re-entry and landed as extremely rare and valuable meteorites			1
' however , the group 's initial analysis of its trajectory , based on the 50 sightings that were reported to it , suggests that it may well have fallen into the @entity16			1
@entity11 said : ' it is very likely something has survived and landed in the @entity16			2
probably no bigger than 30 to 50 grams			0
' it added that the meteorite was burning at a very low altitude of 21 miles , compared to the usual 50 to 75 miles and was formed of ' very hard and dense material compared to soft cometary material which we normally see as meteor showers '			1
the network is appealing for members of the public to report eyewitness accounts of the event			1
it comes after astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor triggered the conversion of biblical figure @entity57 , one of the most influential figures in early @entity60 , experts believe the bright light in the sky that blinded him for three days match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above @entity68 in @entity69 in 2013			1
dr @entity70 , co-founder of the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , examined three accounts of @entity57 's conversion in the @entity76			0
astronomers revealed that they believe a meteor that streaked across the sky above @entity68 in @entity69 ( pictured ) triggered the conversion of biblical figure @entity57 the fireball above @entity68 ( above ) was captured by a number of dashboard cameras in cars writing in the journal @entity85 , he said : ' the first - century book , @entity87 , gives three separate descriptions of a bright light " from heaven " , which occurred probably in the 30s ( @entity91 ) near @entity92 , @entity93			1
' the details offer a strikingly good match to a @entity68 - class or @entity97 - class fireball			2
' in the accounts given in the @entity76 , @entity57 had been one of the zealous persecutors of the followers of @entity101			0
however , during a journey to @entity92 , @entity93 , he and his companions saw a bright light in the sky			0
@entity57 was blinded for three days and he heard a divine voice or sound			0
the experience apparently so affected @entity57 that he converted to @entity60 and undertook several influential missions to spread the word of @entity101 around the @entity111			0
many believe @entity57 's preaching led to the rise of much of the theology and traditions in the @entity118 and @entity119 faith strands that exist today			0
however , some have attempted to explain @entity57 's vision as being the result of some kind of seizure or of sunstroke			0
dr @entity70 , however , says the description of the light in the sky , the thunderous sound and the temporary blindness all match the events of a meteorite			0
he said the @entity135 meteor , which exploded in the atmosphere close to the @entity69 city , is a good example of what @entity57 may have experienced			2
he said that the bright light in the sky - which was ' brighter than the sun , shining round me ' - matches videos of the @entity68 meteor , which was estimated to be three times as bright as the sun. its movement across the sky created fast moving shadows that would have given the impression of the light moving around @entity57 .			2
