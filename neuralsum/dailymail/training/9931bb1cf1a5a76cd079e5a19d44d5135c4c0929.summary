' a healthcare assistant at the disgraced @entity3 pulled a dementia patient around by his pyjamas and then called him an ' animal ' , a nursing tribunal heard today mrs @entity19 , who has been a nurse at the hospital since 1985 , said ms @entity9 was hard - working but could sometimes be abrupt with other members of staff , but that it was to do with her @entity15 accent and demeanour			1
however , on this occasion ms @entity9 , who had qualified as a midwife in her home country , was ' losing it ' , mrs @entity19 said			1
' she just seemed to be out of control with what she was saying			0
' i have been a nurse for a long time and i have never witnessed anybody saying anything like that at all and she did appear to be almost losing it , really			0
' ms @entity9 , who was employed by the hospital between april 2009 and september 2010 , was not present at the hearing in central @entity50			1
it is understood she has not formally admitted or denied any of the charges she faces			0
the @entity8 says 41 current or previous nurses and midwives at the hospital are were reported , but 31 of these cases have now been closed			1
ms @entity9 's former colleague @entity19 told the hearing that the @entity15 healthcare assistant appeared to be ' losing it ' that day on the ward the tribunal heard that the patient had been in the hospital just over a month receiving treatment for kidney stones when the incident took place just after 3am on july 22 , 2010			1
he was said to be aggressive in his speech or manner around 80 per cent of the time and usually had a one - to - one carer looking after him who would sometimes need the assistance of another if the patient became particularly difficult			2
on this occasion , that carer went for a break , leaving ms @entity9 in charge			1
the hearing comes after a damning report into failings at the hospital , which found ' appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients '			2
the report into @entity88 highlighted the neglect of patients between 2005 and 2009			0
some were left for hours sitting in their own faeces , food and drink was left out of reach and hygiene was so poor that relatives had to clean toilets themselves			0
at today ’s tribunal , mrs @entity19 said ms @entity9 , known by colleagues as ' @entity101 ' , would often ' huff and puff when talking with patients with dementia '			1
' i believe this was due to her nationality , ' she said			0
but mrs @entity19 added that she never saw her being rude to patients , and would only be ' abrupt ' with other members of staff , and would always carry out her duties			0
while ms @entity9 had received general training in looking after vulnerable adults , she had not received specific training for dementia patients , ward manager @entity117 told the tribunal			1
it was also possible that ms @entity9 , who would often work extra shifts , had worked more than 40 hours in the week leading up to the incident , which happened in the early hours of a thursday morning			1
but mrs @entity117 would have been unaware of how many extra hours she had done if they had not been on her ward , where the incident happened			2
@entity124 , the hospital 's matron of medicine , told the tribunal she thought @entity9 did not treat dementia sufferers as human the tribunal heard that after taking over care of the @entity132 ’s sufferer , ms @entity9 would have then been responsible for her regular 15 patients as well as the one - to - one care of the 73 - year - old man			1
but she would not have to look after him for more than an hour , the tribunal heard			0
@entity124 , the hospital ’s matron of medicine , interviewed ms @entity9 after the incident and said the carer denied pushing and dragging the patient around , saying she was guiding him			1
ms @entity9 said she noticed the patient was straining for the loo as he was walking around the ward and so guided him into the toilet			1
' he walked outside ( the toilet ) without any pants or trousers at all so i needed to sort him out to protect his dignity ' , ms @entity9 said to ms @entity124			2
' i did n’t pull him			0
' ms @entity9 also said it would have been difficult for her to manhandle him because he was much taller and bigger than her , but she did admit shouting at him			2
ms @entity124 told the tribunal she thought ms @entity9 did not treat dementia sufferers as human			2
' it came across that @entity161 felt the patient was not human because he had alzheimer ’s disease , ' she told the tribunal			0
' i ’m unsure whether she understood the extent of her actions and the severity of the consequences			0
' when questioned about this description by the panel , ms @entity124 said ms @entity9 would acknowledge the feelings of the patient ’s wife and family but not him			2
' she was n’t acknowledging that he would have feelings			0
she did n’t understand that by raising her voice and shouting - she did n’t acknowledge that he could be upset as a result of her actions , ' ms @entity124 said			0
ms @entity9 was suspended after the incident and has not worked at the hospital since			1
@entity181 , medical director at @entity88 said : ' this incident was dealt with very swiftly when it happened in 2010			0
the member of staff was suspended pending our investigation and never returned to work at our @entity88			0
' an overall verdict is expected tomorrow or thursday , an @entity8 spokeswoman said			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
