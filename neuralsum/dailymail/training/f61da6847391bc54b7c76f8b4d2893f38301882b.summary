imagine a world where a handheld gadget scans your body and diagnoses illnesses in seconds - reducing hospital visits and potentially saving your life			1
it may sound like the work of science fiction but engineers in @entity11 have taken their lead from the @entity14 franchise and developed a real - life version of the show ’s medical tricorder			2
the @entity18 can read a person ’s temperature , heart rate , blood oxygen levels , and more , simply being held against their forehead			1
it is held on a person 's temple for 10 seconds			1
built - in sensors then establish body temperature and heart rate a tricorder is a scanning device used by @entity37 personnel in the @entity14 universe			1
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder and a medical tricorder			0
medical tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient , either in a ‘ sick bay ’ on a star ship or during an away mission			0
the advanced scanning tool can determine a patient ’s medical status and readings , and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination			0
it was developed by @entity18 ’s ceo @entity57 , 56 , at @entity59 ’s @entity58 in @entity11			1
a prototype of the @entity18 was first unveiled in 2012 and the latest model is on display at the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) in @entity64			1
the portable electronic device contains a variety of different sensors , plus a microphone on the top of the gadget , that can read five vital signs			1
these include body temperature , heart rate , oximetry ( blood oxygen levels ) , @entity78 waves , heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time ( @entity81 ) - the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person ’s body			1
@entity81 is related to blood pressure			0
its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds			1

these include body temperature , heart rate , oximetry ( blood oxygen levels ) , ecg waves , heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time ( @entity81 ) this information is then stored on a smartphone app that patients can use to monitor their health , or can be shared with doctors for example			1
the tricorder uses a @entity116 adapter that can be hooked into a usb port , and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery			0
a tricorder prop from @entity121 , a @entity14 film			0
now researchers are creating real - life versions when it is being used a few times every day , the battery lasts for about a week , the firm says			0
the gadget was expected to go on sale by the end of 2013 but the company has not announced when it will be widely available released			2
it will need to be approved by the @entity132 in the @entity133 before it can go on sale , but the company is said to be ' actively seeking this approval			0
' as part of this approval process , @entity18 intends to send working protypes to 10,000 people in march			2
the @entity18 is expected to cost around $ 199 ( £ 120 ) and will be available to consumers			2
according to @entity57 : ‘ it ’s no accident that doctor visits start with checking your vital signs			2
‘ @entity18 provides you with access to valuable data which your body provides every day			2
use it to analyse , track , and trend your vitals with unprecedented simplicity			0
’ at last year 's @entity63 , @entity153 set up a $ 10m ( £ 6.5m ) @entity154			0
the prize is on offer to whoever can create and market a @entity14 - like medical ' tricorder capable of recording ' key health metrics and diagnosing a set of 15 diseases '			0
it also need to have a maximum weight of 5lb			0
a tricorder is a scanning device used by @entity37 personnel in the @entity14 universe			0
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder , pictured here being used by @entity172 , played by @entity173 the gadget , left , was expected to go on sale by the end of 2013 but still needs to be approved by the @entity132 in the @entity133 all the information captured by the device is stored on a smartphone app , right , that patients can use to monitor their health , or can be shared with doctors for example .			0

@entity18 uses the operating *system* @entity59 uses in its @entity187 rover
to take a reading , the gadget is held on a person ’s temple for 10 seconds
sensors and a built - in microphone read a variety of vital health signs
this includes temperature , heart rate , blood oxygen levels and more
full *technical* *specifications* have not been released , but a prototype is on display at the @entity63 in @entity64
