a teenager at one of the country 's most prestigious private schools has outed himself as a virgin and is encouraging his classmates to employ the same restraint to avoid getting their hearts broken			1
@entity8 , 18 , a sixth former at @entity10 , @entity11 , wrote an article in his school magazine warning peers that ' casual sex never works in the long term '			1
mr @entity8 - a pupil at the £ 30,000 - per year school which counts author @entity17 and broadcaster @entity18 among its alumni - described sex as ' the glue ' which connects two people ' physically and emotionally '			1
@entity8 , 18 , wrote an article in the school magazine at @entity10 , @entity11 , outing himself as a virgin and encouraging other students to refrain from having ' casual sex ' but he said boys often learned about sex through pornography and thought it was ' just for them ' - which would invariably leave girls , who consider sex to be romantic , disappointed			1
according to @entity35 , mr @entity8 wrote : ' i believe that sex is an incredibly strong symbol of love between two people			1
think of it as glue			0
once you have sex with someone , you 're connected to them emotionally and physically			1
' if you tear that bond the rip leaves open scars where the glue once was			0
that 's why ' casual sex ' never works in the long term , it just does n't			1
' mr @entity8 , who has written the story for @entity55 , the school 's magazine , said he had decided to ' go public ' with his virginity because he thought the pressure on younger pupils to have sex was ' depressing '			1
he believes 90 per cent of people are drunk when they lose their virginity which ' upsets ' him			0
he also said most of his friends at the co-educational private school , which was set up in 1859 , knew he was a virgin but not many understood the reasons why - which led him to write the article			1
mr @entity8 said his classmates at @entity10 in @entity69 , @entity11 - which costs around £ 30,000 a year to attend - know he is a virgin but do not understand the reasons why the student also wrote that he had been surprised at the attitude of boys towards girls in their age group			1
but he admitted himself that his plan could take ' a lot of self - discipline '			2
mr @entity8 said there were ' incredibly good - looking girls ' at the school and there had been times when he had been forced to ' take a step back '			1
the pupil 's comment comes just days after it emerged nearly one in ten students at @entity89 universities admit they first had sex at the age of 14 or younger			2
the private boarding and day school college counts broadcaster @entity18 , pictured left , and author @entity17 , pictured right , among its alumni the shocking survey of more than 6,000 students at 100 universities , carried out by @entity100 , found nine per cent of students admitted they lost their virginity before they reached their 15th birthday , with two per cent saying they had sex before they turned 14			1
by the time they reached 16 - the legal age of consent - that figure had risen to almost one in four			0
latest figures from the @entity109 published in 2011 show the number of young people having sex has dropped			0
according to the findings , 27 per cent of men aged between 15 and 24 had not had sex			0
this compared to 22 per cent in 2001			0
government figures also show young people who admitted drinking alcohol in the previous week had also dropped by one quarter in nine years			0
the statistics show 12 % of school pupils had drunk alcohol in the last week , compared with 26 % in 2001			2
one year earlier in 2010 , 13 % of pupils reported drinking in the last week			2
the survey also found that more than half have had unprotected sex while 61 per cent used camera phones to send explicit pictures or videos of themselves to partners , known as ' sexting '			0
after starting university , more than half admitted to having one - night stands and six per cent said they had already had more than 20 partners			0
just eight per cent said they were still virgins			0
@entity139 from the @entity140 , which promotes traditional moral values , said : ' the survey underlines the failure of contraceptive - based sex education to prepare young people for lifelong marriages			2
' contrary to the claims of those who assert that marriage is an outdated institution , the overwhelming majority of students expect to get married , with only six per cent saying they do not wish to marry			0
' yet the casual attitudes towards sex suggested by high levels of one night stands and multiple sexual partners indicate that students are ignorant of the character qualities they will need			2
' meanwhile , the latest figures from the @entity109 published in 2011 show 27 per cent of men aged between 15 and 24 had not had sex , compared with 22 per cent in 2001			0
those who admitted drinking alcohol in the previous week had also dropped by a quarter in that same ten - year period			1
of those aged 11 to 15 , one in eight said they had drunk the week before , according to the 2011 @entity109 figures			0
the college , set on 400 acres of land , counts the broadcaster @entity18 , the comedian and impressionist @entity171 , the singer @entity175 and the journalist and author @entity17 among its alumni			1
the school was founded in the affluent village of @entity69 - also know for housing maximum - security psychiatric hospital @entity179 - in 1859			2
it was opened in honour of the @entity182 , who led @entity89 forces in several large - scale military victories , to educate sons of @entity188 soldiers .			0
