@entity1 's attempt to recover from his defeat to @entity3 in the @entity4 by - election was hit last night by a @entity7 row over whether @entity8 is ‘ full ’ of immigrants			1
an ‘ immigration summit ’ led to an angry clash between the pm ’s allies and rebels demanding a tougher response to @entity16			1
former cabinet minister @entity17 is said to have claimed the @entity8 must shut the door to @entity20 migrants , arguing : ‘ @entity8 is full			1
@entity29 , brother of @entity30 and head of the policy unit working on the party ’s election manifesto , also challenged his claim			1
and @entity37 mp @entity36 praised ‘ hard - working @entity40 and @entity41 ’ , arguing the @entity38 ‘ must not dance to @entity3 ’s tune ’			1
the details have emerged as the prime minister faces criticism from two leading mps in the wake of thursday ’s defeat at the hands of @entity3 defector @entity49			1
@entity50 , vice-chairman of the @entity51 , calls on mr @entity1 in today ’s @entity52 to kick out renegade mps who have flirted with @entity3			1
and former shadow home secretary @entity54 says he must close ‘ the yawning gap between @entity8 ’s political leadership and the people they serve ’ or lose the election			1
the summit was held on tuesday to prepare for a crunch speech on immigration which mr @entity1 is expected to give within days – which mps hope will include a vote - winning set of migration curbs			1
former government minister @entity17 , pictured , told the meeting that in his opinion , @entity8 is full according to one account , the row at @entity26 flared after mr @entity17 demanded a so - called ‘ emergency brake ’ on migrants from the @entity20			1
‘ most people believe @entity8 is full – and they are right			1
we are already a nation of more than 60 million			1
we can not take any more and have to shut the door , ’ he said			1
mr @entity29 appeared to suggest immigration fears are exaggerated			1
he reportedly said that ‘ 95 per cent of @entity8 is undeveloped ’			1
one insider said : ‘ it sounded as though @entity29 was saying there is plenty of room for more immigrants			2
’ mr @entity17 , who yesterday attended a conference of the @entity83 with mr @entity49 , was called ‘ shrill ’ by mr @entity1 ’s immigration special adviser , @entity84 , who once worked for the former @entity20 high commissioner , @entity86 ’s @entity85			1
others rallied behind mr @entity17			1
@entity89 mp @entity88 said mr @entity1 must not be ‘ outflanked ’ by @entity90			1
the @entity91 last week pledged to deny dole to new @entity20 immigrants for two years			1
many @entity51 mps want an even longer ban			1
@entity36 , pictured , warned the meeting that the @entity97 should not march to @entity3 's tune a well - placed source said : ‘ it was pretty lively			2
it was @entity29 , @entity101 and @entity84 versus @entity17 and the rest			1
’ mr @entity29 , 42 , has argued for stronger ties with @entity104			2
some pundits say he is brainier than brother @entity30 and could beat him to the @entity51 leadership			1
a former banker , he is married to @entity108 , who writes for the @entity110 newspaper			2
millionairess entrepreneur ms @entity36 , 57 , is the first openly lesbian conservative mp			2
she gave those at the meeting a written statement , which said : ‘ there is a danger that the anti-immigration and anti-eu minority tail is wagging the majority @entity8 dog			2
there is a clear case that needs to be made for immigration			1
their role in wealth creation should not be underestimated			2
‘ the day people are put off by the constant negative rhetoric about people coming to this country , and stop coming , is the day we will have far more to worry about			2
’ she is said to have highlighted a recent poll which showed that more than two thirds of the public would not vote for @entity3 in any circumstance			2
mr @entity17 , 71 , a hardliner on welfare and immigration , once wrote a pamphlet entitled ‘ immigration , too much of a good thing ’			1
in 1992 he called for an end to the ‘ something for nothing society ’ via a parody of the @entity146 ’s ‘ @entity149 ’ song from @entity147 and @entity148 ’s @entity146			2
a source said : ‘ @entity29 and @entity84 are part of the cosy @entity152			2
they just do n’t get ordinary people ’s concerns about immigration			1
’ @entity29 , left , head of @entity1 's policy unit called for calm claiming that fears over immigration are being ' exaggerated '			1
however , one @entity51 branded @entity29 as part of ' the cosy @entity152 ' but a @entity160 aide said there was concern at the tone of some of the comments , adding : ‘ some of them sounded more like @entity16 than conservative mps			1
they were coming out with crude stuff like “ we ’ve got to stop @entity40 stealing the jobs of our voters ”			2
’ the prime minister has discussed with aides the logistics of imposing a ‘ brake ’ on individual @entity20 countries when , for example , migrants reach a specified proportion of the @entity8 ’s population			1
he has been advised by the @entity182 that as the treaties stand , any brake could only be triggered in the event of an emergency such as a natural disaster			2
in his article , mr @entity50 says his party ‘ put aside its moral compass ’ during the @entity4 by - election by ‘ banging on ’ about immigration			1
‘ we fought the wrong campaign against @entity49 and have paid the price , ’ he writes			2
‘ in recent weeks and months we have allowed the terms of the debate to be framed and set by the pernicious , dripping , corrosive cynicism of @entity3			2
’ and in his article , below , mr @entity54 says : ‘ the @entity4 result is not some bolt out of the blue			2
it is the inevitable result of the most dramatic shift in voter behaviour in our lifetimes			0
’ last night , mr @entity29 declined to comment			0
but a @entity26 spokesman said : ‘ this is not a fair and accurate representation of the meeting			0
’ when contacted , mr @entity17 also declined to comment on the discussions			1
ms @entity36 and mr @entity88 could not be reached for comment			0
@entity54 , pictured , warned that the conservatives and @entity86 can no longer count on the support of two - thirds of the electorate on tuesday i walked the streets of @entity4 trying to persuade @entity3 voters to vote @entity97			0
as i did so , in the commons the @entity160 was suffering a defeat on pub regulation , as publicans won the right to buy beers from somebody other than the owner of their pub chain			0
it was a victory for private enterprise over big business			0
the government was seen to be on the side of big business			0
only the week before , it effectively denied the house a proper debate on the critical @entity239			0
the voters of @entity4 would have said , ‘ i told you so ’			0
they would see these incidents as part and parcel of the problem with modern politics , that the leadership of all the main parties are aloof , out of touch and have little interest in ordinary people			0
@entity253 ’s tactless tweet characterised all too clearly what an ever growing part of the electorate see as the @entity259 elite ’s scornful view			0
the @entity4 result is not some bolt out of the blue			0
it is the inevitable result of the most dramatic shift in voter behaviour in our lifetimes			0
as it stands , 44 per cent of voters will back a different party at the @entity271 than in 2010			0
the biggest migrants are conservatives joining @entity3 , and @entity274 joining @entity86			1
but all parties are losing significant support to ‘ do n’t know ’			0
as a result , the conservatives and @entity86 can no longer command even two - thirds of the electorate ’s support			0
the sense of rejection of the establishment was put best by the victim of @entity253 ’s tweet when he said , ‘ i ’ve not voted and i ’m not going to			0
no matter who you have in , it does n’t matter			0
’ this sense of disenfranchisement hurts all of us , but as the party in power it hurts us most of all			0
this is why on the best polls available in the @entity97 ’ marginal seats , those commissioned by @entity299 , we seem set to lose a disastrous proportion			0
after @entity302 stood down in 2007 there was a public desire for clarity , coherence and principle after years of spin			0
we were unable to harness it in 2010			0
i believe it is not too late to tap into that mood now			0
in the six months leading up to the general election , we are free of the shackles of the @entity314			0
what we say and do are more about what happens after the election than before			0
that means we should be able to address the issues of @entity320 , immigration , welfare and taxation with more clarity than has been the case in the last four years			1
lord @entity299 's polls of marginal seats show the @entity97 losing ' a disastrous proportion ' but in the end the public are not just making a judgement on policy			0
they are also making a judgment on character			0
they want to believe that their leaders understand their problems , care about their problems , and have the courage , strength and clarity of purpose to do something about them			0
this is the yawning gap between @entity8 ’s political leadership and the people they serve that has to be closed			0
if we can do that , we will win the next election			0
if not , no amount of incompetence on the part of @entity86 will save us from yet another defeat .			0
