the largest warship ever built in the @entity1 has been successfully floated on the water for the first time			1
the 65,000 - tonne @entity5 aircraft carrier @entity6 was floated out of the docks at @entity9 shipyard , where she was assembled , into the waters of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the carrier was formally named by the @entity14 earlier this month in a ceremony at the @entity16 in @entity17 , where she was assembled and fitted out			1
it was then manoeuvred out of the dock in a three - hour operation this morning , and berthed at a nearby jetty			2
teams will now continue to fit out the ship and prepare the vessel for sea trials in 2016 , and it will be fully operational by 2020			1
however , there are continuing doubts over the military 's ability to fill out the plane with its full contingent of @entity47 fighter jets			1
the @entity6 is equipped to carry 36 of the planes , but so far only three of the 48 ordered from the @entity51 manufacturers have arrived			1
for the naming ceremony a fortnight ago a dummy version made from aluminium and fibreglass was displayed on top of the craft because no real ones were available to make the journey			2
the government has ordered 48 of the planes in total , and plans to buy more , but it is unclear when the deliveries will finally be made			0
one day : this computer - generated image shows how the specially - modified @entity47 jets will one day take off and land from the carrier - but for now the jets are suffering setbacks ritual : two weeks ago the @entity14 attended a naming ceremony at the @entity9 docks near @entity17 , where she christened the ship with a bottle of whisky procession : dignitaries and military commanders attended the launch , which was punctuated by a flyover the the @entity82 the model also suffered a setback this month when @entity51 authorities grounded the model after an engine fire			1
part of the engine tore through the top of the plane and set alight during an aborted landing at a @entity94 airbase , causing the whole fleet to be grounded			1
the ship and a second vessel , the under - construction @entity97 @entity96 , are the largest warships ever built for the @entity5			1
together they are known as queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers and are being built by the @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , a partnership of @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109			0
the vacated dock will be used for the final assembly of @entity97 @entity96 , which will begin in september			0
those behind the project , which costs an estimated £ 6.2 billion overall , say the @entity115 will be the centrepiece of @entity1 's naval capability			0
each 65,000 - tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four - acre military operating base , which can be deployed worldwide , operating the @entity47 and a number of types of helicopter			1
they will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity , from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief			0
at 72,000 tons and 932 feet long , the @entity6 aircraft carrier is taller than @entity131 and considerably wider than the @entity132 at its widest point			2
she generates enough energy to power @entity136 , she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day - and travel 500 miles a day , too			0
above all , she will be able to deliver 36 f - 35 lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of @entity1 sovereign territory afloat			2
her sister ship , the @entity96 , is already in production , though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational , mothballed or sold			2
each ship , which has a life expectancy of around 50 years , will be fitted out with more than three million metres of cable and it will have enough power to light up a small town			0
this week , the defence secretary , @entity150 , described the project as a feat of engineering to match the @entity154			0
you could say much the same about the price - more than £ 6 billion for the pair			0
and that does not include the planes			0
each 65,000 - tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four - acre military operating base , which can be deployed worldwide , operating the @entity47 and a number of types of helicopter			1
at full capacity , the carrier will be able to launch an aircraft every 30 seconds			0
they will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity , from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief			0
@entity6 will have 679 permanent crew and capacity for 1,600 crew members when fully operational			1
the ship features a new style of ' twin island ' command points - one at the front for steering and one at the back for aircraft direction			2
thanks to the cutting - edge technology on board , commanders on the bridge will be able to see 250 miles away			0
the carrier 's range is said to be 10,000 nautical miles and the ship is fitted with a long range @entity192 that is capable of tracking more than 1,000 targets at once or spotting a tennis ball travelling at 2,000 miles per hour .			2

@entity6 was floated out of the @entity197 into the @entity11 for the first time today
the carrier - the @entity5 's largest - ever ship - was officially named by the @entity14 in a ceremony earlier this month
when fully operational in 2020 she will be able to carry a contingent of 36 @entity47 fighter planes
but the models have yet to be delivered - and the entire @entity51 fleet was recently grounded *due* to engine trouble
