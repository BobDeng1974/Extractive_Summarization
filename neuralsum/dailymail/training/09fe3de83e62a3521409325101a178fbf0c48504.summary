by @entity0 the @entity2 warlord who allegedly led the 2012 attack on the @entity5 consulate in @entity6 , @entity2 , has been captured by @entity8 commandos			1
@entity10 was taken off the streets of @entity6 and whisked away to a ' secure location outside of @entity2 ' for interrogation on sunday , the @entity9 reports			1
@entity14 reports that he is currently en route to the @entity5 aboard a @entity17 ship			1
@entity5 officials have stopped short of calling him a ' mastermind			0
' nearly two years after the deadly assault , he is the first person held to account by @entity5 authorities			1
@entity10 , a 42 - year - old hardline @entity38 leader , has openly taunted @entity5 authorities for years , appearing in public in @entity6 for several interviews with @entity5 media , including @entity43 , in august 2013 - days after the @entity44 levied terrorism charges against him			1
@entity5 commandos and the @entity47 captured @entity10 , said to be one of the masterminds behind the 2012 consulate attack in @entity6 , @entity2 burned out : the @entity5 consulate in @entity6 was burned out and destroyed by the terrorist attack on september 11 , 2012			1
@entity10 is the only person so far arrested for the deadly raid @entity10 has remained free to roam his hometown of @entity55 , despite being indicted by @entity5 authorities			1
he said he was never questioned by @entity5 officials even though he made no attempt to hide			0
he told the @entity57 that he did not plan or participate in the assault , though he admitted he was there at the end			0
witnesses describe seeing him direct the fighters who stormed the gates of the @entity5 compound			0
the raid sunday was carried out jointly by @entity8 , the @entity68 's most elite special operations unit , and the @entity47 after more than a year of planning , the @entity65 reports			1
the commandos even went so far as to build a mock - up of @entity10 's compound on their base at @entity74 , @entity75 - like the @entity17 's @entity76 did before the @entity78 raid			1
however , @entity5 officials are billing it as a major achievement for the @entity80			0
president @entity81 trumpeted the victory , saying that @entity10 will face ' the full weight of @entity5 justice			1
' ' it 's important for us to send a message to the world that when @entity5 are attacked , no matter how long it takes , we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice , ' he said before a speech on manufacturing in @entity92 on tuesday			1
one source told the @entity9 that @entity10 's capture is ' a reminder that when the @entity5 says it ’s going to hold someone accountable and he will face justice , this is what we mean			1
' the @entity80 would not comment on why he was captured now - nearly a year after he was indicted			0
however , the @entity65 cites a source who suggests that @entity81 lacked the legal authority to send troops into @entity2 unilaterally because @entity10 did n't have links to @entity104			1
only recently have investigators found links between him and the terrorists who attacked the @entity5 in 2001			0
the time , however , is a victory that comes at a bad time for president @entity81 foreign policy			1
the return of prisoner of war @entity114 in exchange for five @entity118 detainees and the rise of a violent sectarian uprising in @entity121 have had @entity81 on a back footing			0
national tragedy : @entity31 , who succumbed to smoke inhalation after the attack , was the first @entity5 ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 former @entity129 ( left ) and @entity130 ( right ) were working as @entity132 security contractors when they were killed defending from a second wave of the attack @entity135 , an it specialist for the @entity136 , was also killed in the attack @entity31 , the first @entity5 ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 , died of smoke inhalation after the terrorist attackers set fire to the @entity5 compound			2
@entity135 , a 34 - year - old computer system manager with the @entity136 was also killed			0
former @entity129 and @entity144 , who were working as @entity5 security contractors for the @entity132 , died in the second wave of the attack as they defended the adjacent @entity132 building after mounting a rescue mission			0
@entity80 spokesman @entity150 would not comment on where @entity151 would be held as he awaits trial - whether it would be in a federal facility or the detention center at @entity157 , @entity158			2
officials told the @entity9 that he would likely remain on the @entity17 ship to be interrogated by military and intelligence agents			0
then a ' clean team ' would be brought in to give him his @entity165 and question him in a manner that could be used at a federal trial			0
the 2012 @entity6 attack has been a major political liability for the @entity80 and for then - secretary of state @entity171			2
@entity172 have launched numerous official investigations and alleged that officials botched security at the consulate and ignored @entity31 ' request for more guards			0
they also claim @entity180 officials tried to over up the real motive for the terrorist attack - claiming at the time that it was a riot over an @entity185 video - to improve @entity81 's reelection chances			2
the @entity187 recently established a select committee , nearly two years after the incident , to formally review the handling of the run - up to and aftermath of the assault			0
president @entity81 : ' with this operation , the @entity5 has once again demonstrated that we will do whatever it takes to see that justice is done when people harm @entity5			1
we will continue our efforts to bring to justice those who were responsible for the @entity6 attacks			1
' secretary of state @entity203 : ' this weekend , that work took a dramatic step forward			0
@entity206 , an alleged key leader of the attacks in @entity6 , is now in @entity5 custody			1
he will face a court of law and be held accountable for his actions			0
this bold action by the superb @entity5 military is a clear reminder to anyone who dares do us harm that they will not escape with impunity			2
' senator @entity218 , @entity172 of @entity219 : ' @entity206 has been openly defying the @entity5 for more than twenty months			0
now that he is in custody , the proper authorities should be given ample time to assess what intelligence he may have about ongoing terrorist operations against @entity5			2
@entity206 is a foreign terrorist , captured by our special forces overseas for his violent attack on a @entity5 facility			2
he belongs in @entity118 and in the military justice system , not in the @entity5 civilian court system with the constitutional protections afforded @entity5 citizens			1
' congressman @entity233 , @entity172 of @entity234 and @entity236 chairman : ' this is overdue , considering that this individual has made himself available to multiple media outlets in the 19 months since the deaths of four @entity5 , including the first @entity5 ambassador killed in an attack since 1979			1
i hope that this capture brings us closer to justice and accountability			0
we should right now be getting from him as much intelligence as possible			0
' senator @entity250 , @entity251 of @entity234 and @entity253 chairman : ' i fully support the administration ’s efforts to gather intelligence from @entity206 and prosecute him in federal court			2
past cases against terrorists like @entity206 have shown that we can obtain intelligence , convict terrorists and lock them away for a very long time			0
the @entity5 criminal justice system has successfully convicted over 500 terrorists since 9/11 , and i have full confidence in the ability of our federal courts			2

@entity10 , 42 , was captured sunday outside @entity6 , @entity2 , in a joint raid by @entity270 troops and the @entity47
@entity10 was charged in august 2013 with leading the attacks that killed four @entity5
however , he has lived in the open in @entity2 and *flouted* @entity5 authorities - even appearing in public for media interviews
@entity10 is currently en route to the @entity5 to stand trial in federal court
president @entity81 said : ' with this operation , the @entity5 has once again demonstrated that we will do whatever it takes to see that justice is done when people harm @entity5 '
