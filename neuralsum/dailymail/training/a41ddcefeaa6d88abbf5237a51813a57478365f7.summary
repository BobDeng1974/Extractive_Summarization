by @entity0 @entity1 has paid tribute to @entity4 ’s ‘ fantastic pedigree ’ but refused to say if he will serve under the @entity5 as a player or coach at @entity9 next season			1
@entity1 is understood to be disappointed that he has not been given more of an opportunity to stake a claim for the job after being installed as @entity9 ’s interim boss for the final four games of the season			1
the club are considering offering the 40 - year - old a new 12 - month playing contract , but the decision over whether he will be retained on the coaching staff is down to @entity22			1
exit the dragon ? @entity1 will not commit to working at @entity9 as a player or coach next season fair play : @entity1 ( @entity27 ) admits that the @entity5 has ' fantastic pedigree ' to become next @entity9 manager @entity9 ’s plan to appoint the @entity32 coach next week is highly unlikely to change despite indications from @entity35 coach @entity34 yesterday that all is not well in @entity37			1
@entity22 will bring his own backroom team to @entity39 , casting uncertainty over the futures of @entity1 ’s assistants @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , while @entity46 is set to be offered his old role with the under - 18s			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , is known to be unsure if he wants to be part of the new regime			1
he grew frustrated with his lack of input under @entity53 after being named player - coach last summer , and knows that he is likely to have even less say with @entity22 at the helm			2
what became of the likely lads ? the futures of @entity9 's ' class of 92 ' on the coaching staff are uncertain publicly , he praised @entity9 ’s prospective new boss yesterday			1
privately , there are reservations as talks with @entity9 chief @entity66 continue			2
pressed on his future at @entity39 , @entity1 refused to look beyond the end of the season			1
may 3 @entity70 ( @entity71 ) may 6 @entity72 ( @entity71 ) may 11 @entity73 ( a ) ‘ @entity74 ( @entity22 ) has got a brilliant reputation and is a successful manager in different countries , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’s taken @entity32 to the @entity78			0
yes , he ’s got fantastic pedigree			1
‘ i ’m constantly speaking to @entity80 change all the time			0
at the moment he ’s just letting me getting on with preparing the team and doing the best i can on the training pitch and preparing the team for winning the next three games			0
it ’s just until the end of the season			2
we ’ll chat when that ’s over and that ’s all			0
right hand man : the @entity32 manager may want to bring in his own staff , which may include @entity95 ( r ) ‘ there is no point in thinking if i want to be an assistant or a manager somewhere else			2
there ’s so many things to think about			0
my concentration is n’t on next season it ’s on this season			2
’ it raises the prospect of @entity1 , the most decorated player in @entity108 football since making his @entity9 debut 23 years ago , leaving the club after next weekend ’ s final game against @entity73			1
indeed , he might already have played his last game at @entity39 after a record 962 appearances for the club			0
‘ it ’s not something i ’ve thought about , ’ he added			0
‘ we ’ll just have to wait and see			0
my main priority is winning the games			0
is me playing giving us the best chance ? ‘ i ’ve got a lot to think about , whether to carry on playing			0
i ’m still training and doing bits and pieces so i ’m still in the frame of maybe being involved in the remaining games			0
’ old guard : @entity1 hopes that veterans @entity127 ( r ) and @entity128 stay on at @entity39 despite uncertainty over his own future , @entity1 backed fellow veterans @entity127 and @entity128 to extend their playing careers at @entity9 if given the chance			1
‘ i ’d like them to stay on , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s their decision , their contracts are both up			0
they have both given massive service to the club and they are both fit , and looked good last week			0
i do n’t see why not			0
‘ it ’s everyone ’s decision – @entity127 , @entity146 , @entity66 and whoever is the manager next year – but i still think they have a lot to offer			1
they ’ve been great players and remain assets to a club like @entity9			1

@entity1 has praised @entity4 's ' fantastic pedigree ' to become the next @entity9 manager
@entity157 is not sure if he will stay on as a player or coach at @entity9 next season
class of 92 's coaching positions also uncertain if @entity5 brings his own staff with him
@entity1 would like to see veterans @entity127 and @entity128 remain
