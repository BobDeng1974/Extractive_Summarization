by @entity0 an anticipated @entity2 meeting between prime ministers @entity3 and @entity5 on the sidelines of the @entity7 in september has raised hopes on both sides of the border			0
@entity11 remains circumspect , however , having received inputs about a renewed and reconfigured @entity14 effort to put the @entity16 issue back on the boil			1
@entity11 has concluded @entity19 policy makers must factor in @entity5 's secret ' k plan ' before resuming talks with @entity22			1
prime ministers @entity3 ( right ) and @entity5 ( left ) are expected to meet to discuss @entity14 relations at the @entity7 @entity7 mail today has accessed a series of internal notes sent to top officials of the security establishment in @entity11 that speak of @entity5 clearing a new @entity16 strategy			1
@entity5 , who has espoused the @entity16 cause in earlier stints as prime minister , wants the nerve centre of this strategy to be a new @entity35 in his office			1
this cell will monitor @entity14 's fresh push on @entity16 , in contrast to the previous @entity41 government that put @entity16 on the back - burner			1
@entity5 's @entity43 has been perceived as soft on terror groups that found safe haven in @entity46 , the party 's traditional stronghold			1
there has been an upswing in violence in the @entity51 since @entity5 took over as prime minister ( see box )			0
two - faced @entity14 according to the notes , @entity5 has told his key advisors that @entity16 has to be given priority but he and the members of his cabinet should not be seen as raising it too much			1
anti-india rhetoric should not be associated with key functionaries of the government , the @entity5 plan says			1
analysts believe this part of the @entity5 strategy is driven by the motive of keeping the @entity14 - @entity19 relationship on an even keel in the run - up to the @entity2 meeting , for @entity22 wants to be seen as a moderate nation			1
attacks on the @entity74 in @entity75 have gone up in recent weeks			0
it could be part of @entity14 strategy to bring the @entity51 to a boil again supporters of @entity14 's outlawed @entity81 hard line group , @entity82 ( @entity83 ) shout @entity85 slogans during a protest in @entity87 the flip side of this soft projection is that the @entity16 cell will direct propaganda activities , receiving directions from @entity5 to ensure that the issue stays on the boil			1
@entity14 's @entity95 ( @entity95 ) has been told to tell militants to limit their activities , keeping any links with state functionaries invisible			1
this would mean a reorganisation of terror camps , and a slowdown in infiltration			0
" it is to ensure that @entity16 is back on the international radar with complete deniability for the @entity14 government , " a south @entity11 source said			1
@entity110 of the @entity5 strategy will be to ensure high voltage international propaganda			2
the @entity95 has been told to activate its propaganda cells on @entity16 in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity2 and @entity118			2
these will not be run by the @entity121 diplomatic missions but by @entity122 and @entity16 support groups with the funding to be channelled by the @entity95			0
the use of local @entity122 to espouse the @entity16 cause at the @entity7 and in the @entity127 is part of this new strategy			0
some reports say that key @entity121 functionaries have also been told not to indulge in @entity19 - bashing			1
significantly , @entity133 leaders like @entity134 have been told to continue their @entity85 propaganda but keep the government completely out so deniability can be achieved			1
part of the strategy is to ensure that while infiltration will be controlled , the attacks in @entity16 will be intensified to give them a local colour , and as the reaction from the @entity19 security forces grows , this will be showcased through hired @entity122 and amplified through media stories to help internationalise the @entity16 issue			2
while the strategy is devious from the analysis provided to @entity11 is it apparent that @entity5 's k plan will achieve two objectives : one , get the @entity16 issue back into focus as the core issue in the dialogue with @entity19 , and second , to ensure that international pressure is on @entity19 , with the issue taking centre - stage through a concerted campaign by @entity122 in @entity159 and the @entity160 to help build a case for @entity16 being a conflict zone			1
armed with these inputs , @entity19 will now have to factor in the new @entity16 strategy in its diplomatic approach as it prepares for the @entity2 meeting			2
besides this , sustained pressure needs to be built on @entity22 , that the dialogue process will not gain momentum till @entity14 takes action against the perpetrators of the 26/11 attacks			0
bad news for @entity75 while @entity5 is unlikely to make any dramatic concessions to @entity19 on the issue of terrorism , and the 26/11 trial may not yield much , there could be some progress on the issue of trade where @entity22 may give @entity19 most favoured nation status couched in a different name to signal progress			2
with @entity186 back on the table , however , @entity19 should be prepared for a fresh onslaught of violence in @entity16			2
@entity16 , it seems , is back at the nerve centre of the @entity19 - @entity14 ties			1
@entity14 urged @entity19 to bring to justice all those responsible for the killing of @entity194 in @entity19			2
" the killing of @entity194 in the @entity19 held @entity16 is a matter of concern to us			2
@entity14 has expressed its concern over the fresh episode of violence			0
" likewise , the reported desecration of the @entity203 is a matter of grave concern to us			0
we understand that the @entity19 government expressed its intent to carry out an investigation			0
" we hope and urge that it is done expeditiously and those responsible for such acts are brought to justice , " the spokesperson of @entity14 's @entity211 told @entity212 on friday			2
@entity121 , especially the followers of @entity82 ( @entity83 ) chief @entity134 , have taken to to the streets across the country in the past few days to protest against the @entity19 government			0
on friday , the religious leaders delivered hateful speeches against @entity19 and vowed to take revenge			0
followers of groups like @entity83 and @entity223 have urged the @entity5 government to ask @entity19 to stop the massacre of @entity194			0
sources said , the @entity223 was planning to send trained men to @entity16 to fight the @entity19 army			0
however , an influential commander of the outfit refused to comment			0
" my comments are ' i have no comments ' , " @entity231 told @entity212 from an undisclosed location			0
reliable sources said the commanders of militant groups operating in @entity16 are using internet telephones for internal communication to avoid the chances of being tracked .			0
