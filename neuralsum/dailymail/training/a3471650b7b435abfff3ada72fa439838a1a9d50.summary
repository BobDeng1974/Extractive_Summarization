a new theory has surfaced that downplays @entity3 's involvement in the @entity5 hacking scandal and suggests the people responsible are actually @entity7 , based on a linguistics study of the leaked emails			1
security experts believe the origins of the now - infamous @entity12 are @entity7 after analyzing about 1,600 words attached to the @entity5 emails the hacking group leaked to a variety of media outlets			1
the words were investigated by @entity20 - based cyber security firm @entity19			1
' our preliminary results show that @entity5 's attackers were most likely @entity7 , possibly but not likely @entity24 and definitely not @entity26 or @entity27 , ' the company wrote in a @entity29 blog post , according to the @entity30			1
pictured here is the @entity40 in @entity41 the firm deducted that while the analysis did not clear @entity3 of any involvement in the hack , it was unlikely			1
that is based on the phrasing and language used by the hackers , who communicated in @entity52			1
the @entity19 study determined 15 out of 20 phrasings in the emails matched the @entity7 language			1
nine matched @entity24 , and none were @entity58 or @entity27			2
president @entity59 and the @entity60 have accused @entity3 of being behind the hacking saga in response to the @entity5 film @entity63 , which features a mock death of the country 's leader , @entity65			1
the government have not released the sources that lead them to direct blame at @entity3			1
@entity65 has denied any involvement , and accused the @entity72 of temporarily shutting off its internet this week			1
earlier this week , @entity12 failed to deliver a much - hyped ' christmas gift ' they claimed would destroy @entity5			1
' we are preparing for you a @entity29 gift , ' the group posted online in mid-december			2
' the gift will be larger quantities of data			0
and it will be more interesting			0
the gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put @entity85 into the worst state			0
' yet days later a letter released by the hackers on december 18 said that @entity5 had ' suffered enough			2
' people wait in line on christmas day to watch the first screening of the controversial movie @entity63 in @entity93 , @entity94			0
the promise of more @entity5 secrets being revealed has so far failed to materialize since then the hackers appear to have turned their attention to the @entity60 and on december 21 they posted a message which cynically ' praised ' the @entity60 's investigation into the hack , with a link to a video that repeated the phrase ' you are an idiot ' repeatedly			1
on christmas day , people flocked to the 300 or so cinemas showing @entity63 , saying they are taking a stand for freedom			0
while the @entity111 may be done , a new hacking group has already stepped in and taken their place , managing to shut down the company 's @entity113 at the worst possible time - @entity115			2
according to @entity118 , a group called @entity117 is taking credit for the hack , which managed to put the network out of commission for hours not just once , but twice during the holiday			0
they are also claiming to have done the same to @entity125			0
this hack pales in comparison however to the damage inflicted on @entity5 and its employees as a result of the @entity132 hack			0
game over : the @entity5 hack that resulted in the leak of thousands of emails exchanges between @entity138 heavyweights including studio head @entity139 ( right ) and @entity140 ( left ) seems to be over no backlash : this despite the fact that @entity5 decided to reverse their decision made last week to shelve the film following threats of a terrorist incident and of those employees , no one has had to endure more than studio head @entity139 , whose work emails were released on a near daily basis			2
the hackers began their reign of terror on november 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers ' we 've obtained all your internal data			2
' the computers would remain down for over a week , and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the @entity164 war drama @entity165 as well as unreleased studio titles including @entity167 , mr. @entity168 , @entity169 and to write @entity170 online			2
it was around this time in late november that speculation began to mount that @entity3 was likely behind the hack , a claim that seems to be based on nothing other than the fact that the country 's @entity179 ambassador @entity178 wrote a letter to @entity179 secretary general @entity182 taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made , let alone released			1
and although the @entity12 fail to even address these claims , or make any demands of @entity5 , until well into december , the story continues to grow and is accepted by many as fact long before the @entity60 claims to have actual proof of the country 's involvement			1
deny : following an @entity60 report that @entity3 was behind the attack , @entity197 ( above ) released a statement denying the allegation and attacking the @entity72 it is in december that the hackers really turn things up , dumping an astonishing amount of information in the first two weeks of the month			1
salaries of the company 's top executives become public , the script for the new @entity207 film is leaked , and then there are the emails attacking an assortment of a-list actors , writers and directors , along with a racist exchange between @entity218 and her frequent pen - pal in many of these leaked emails , producer @entity140 , in which the two mock president @entity59 by listing what his favorite movie might be			1
the two would later release individual public apologies for their comments			0
this racist exchange is still being addressed by @entity218 , who flew to @entity231 to meet with @entity232 and has given the go ahead to a new program dedicated to promoting racial diversity in film			0
@entity218 does however manage to come off as respectful and understanding when speaking about many of @entity138 's biggest stars , save one incident in which she labels @entity242 an ' a * * hole ' not once , but twice			0
@entity140 on the other hand seems to have no problem talking about the talent behind their back , particularly @entity249 who he labels ' a minimally talented spoiled brat ' in one email , and in another exchange actually removes from the chain in order to tell @entity218 that the actress is ' out of her mind			0
' during this time the group also starts dumping employee medical records , and most notably there letter on december 8 demanding that @entity5 stop the release of their upcoming @entity65 assassination film @entity63			0
then , on december 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch , the group announces plans for their upcoming ' christmas gift ' which they say will put @entity5 ' into the worst state			0
' then things go quiet until december 16 , when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play the interview when it is released on december 25			2
everywhere : the film has now been released across three viewing platforms - theaters , on demand and online by day 's end , the four largest theater chains in the country announced they will not show the film , and the following day @entity5 cancels the film 's release			1
it is then that the @entity12 release the aforementioned december 18 letter saying the @entity5 has suffered enough			1
things finally turned around on wednesday however for @entity5 , when @entity29 came exactly one day early and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing @entity63 online			2
making the release even sweeter for @entity5 was the massive outpouring of public support for the film , with thousands turning out for christmas eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of @entity72 streaming the film online			1
and as an added bonus for @entity5 , the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online , as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters , online and video on demand			2
' it has always been @entity5 's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film , ' @entity85 chair and ceo @entity311 said in a statement			0
' we chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day , and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release			0
' even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week			0
@entity5 only announced on tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on thursday			0
as for the big online announcement , that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 and a @entity5 website created for the film , with the option of renting the film for $ 5.99 or downloading it for $ 16.99			0
there are still questions as to just who was behind the hacking as well , with many experts in the cybersecurity field questioning an @entity60 report that they say proved @entity3 's government masterminded the attack			1
the experts all firmly believe the hack had to be an inside job .			0

@entity20 - based cyber security firm analyzed 1,600 words attached to the leaked emails and postings of @entity12 of the peace
determined the hackers native is most likely @entity7
study does not however rule out @entity3
@entity59 and the @entity60 have blamed the country for the attack
@entity3 has blamed the @entity72 for shutting down its internet
