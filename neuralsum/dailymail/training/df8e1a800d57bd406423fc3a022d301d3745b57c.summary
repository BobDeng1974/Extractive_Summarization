by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has revealed @entity3 sounded him out about returning to @entity4 last november before the @entity4 appointed @entity5			1
@entity2 is back for a second stint at @entity4 , after managing the @entity8 club between 2007 and 2010			1
@entity9 missed out on @entity10 and @entity11 before settling on appointing @entity2 to replace @entity5 , who quit on the eve of the season			1
@entity2 said he was ' not bothered ' to be @entity4 's third choice			1
offer : @entity2 said he was approached about the job before @entity5 was appointed last year ' before @entity5 came there was a possibility that he was n't going to come and we talked then but then he changed his mind and they did fantastically , ' said @entity2			1
' so @entity3 has always known that i am available			0
' i did n't really have to tell him			2
' it 's just he just had to go through the candidates like he did			0
' he said he never offered it to anybody beforehand and if i 'm honest i 'm not really bothered or what the betting was			0
' i 'm just glad that i 'm here now and i 'm not bothered how many were in front of me			0
' @entity2 said he would only have come out of managerial retirement to help @entity4 stabilise their @entity33 status , admitting he received wife @entity34 's approval			1
@entity36 : the former @entity38 and @entity39 manager said he was not bothered about being the @entity4 ' third choice the 65 - year - old has not worked in football since a stint at @entity38 last year , retreating instead to his @entity45 farm			1
@entity2 's first act as @entity4 boss was to secure a season - long loan deal for @entity49 forward @entity50 , who returns to the @entity4 after failing to make the @entity53 grade			1
@entity54 left @entity55 in 2013 for Â£ 15million - but @entity2 rejected suggestions his return is any kind of failure			2
' i was n't really looking to get back into management , but it 's not often you get a chance to repay a club that 's really helped you , so it 's great to have that chance , ' said @entity2			2
potential : @entity2 spoke positively about @entity50 and said he believes he can do really well at @entity4 ' i think there 's still a lot more to come from @entity50			2
' when you 're a young lad and you go to a big club like @entity49 , you can get lost because there are so many good players			0
' people have criticised him for his attitude , but i 've never seen that			0
' i 've always thought his attitude is spot on ; if you 're willing to spend the time with him he 's always willing to learn			0
' so i think we 'll see a really different @entity50 and hopefully he can have a really good season			0
