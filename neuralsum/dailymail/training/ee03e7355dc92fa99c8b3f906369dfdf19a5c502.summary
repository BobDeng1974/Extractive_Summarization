by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 7 august 2013 @entity2 's curiosity rover has celebrated its first anniversary on @entity4 by using its @entity5 at @entity4 instrument to ' sing ' @entity8 by vibrating at different frequencies			1
the rover completed its dramatic descent to land safely on the red planet one year ago and has already achieved its mission aim by discovering that @entity4 could have supported life			1
@entity1 , which is about the size of a small car , is also sending back information about its surroundings to inform future missions to @entity4			0
' @entity1 landed in the @entity32 on @entity4 on 6 august 2012 after being guided some 450 million kilometres away , to within 80m of the planet 's atmosphere			1
speaking at the @entity37 last year , dr @entity35 , director of @entity2 's @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , said : ' the accuracy with which we have to point , to be at the right angle and the right location , is equivalent to me being in @entity43 and hitting a golf ball to @entity45 here in the @entity47 - and the ball landing in a cup that is moving at around 60,000mph , because @entity4 is moving			1
' curiosity has traveled around one mile in the past year			0
this map shows where the rover has been between landing at ' @entity55 ' on 6 august last year and the position reached during the mission 's 351st @entity4 day on 1 august 2013 ' landing on another planet is not a walk in the park ... we have about 3 tonnes of mass coming in at a speed of almost 12,000mph and we have to land softly within six minutes			1
' scientists at @entity2 used a ground - breaking ' sky crane ' carrier to lower the rover to the @entity4 surface			1
since then , the mobile laboratory has provided more than 190 gigabits of data , returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images , fired more than 75,000 laser shots to investigate the composition of targets , collected and analyzed sample material from two rocks and driven more than one mile			1
since landing , @entity1 has shown us a view of @entity4 that has never been seen before			0
so far , the diminutive rover has returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images			1
this scene of 7 photos taken in march shows @entity84 - the two central rocks the rover has travelled almost 700 metres in the past month since leaving an area of @entity4 where it has been analysing rocks for around six months			2
it is now trundling along to its final destination - @entity90 - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of @entity32 by almost three and a half miles			0
@entity90 is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet 's changing environment over time			0
so far , @entity1 has provided more than 190 gigabits of data , returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images , fired more than 75,000 laser shots to investigate the composition of targets , collected and analyzed sample material from two rocks and driven more than one mile certain layers have been identified by @entity4 orbiters as originating in a wet environment			1
the rover first examined ground nearer the crater where it quickly found signs of ' vigorous ancient stream flow ' - the first streambed pebble deposits ever examined up - close on @entity4			2
evidence of a past environment well suited to support microbial life came within the first eight months of the 23 - month primary mission from analysis of the first sample material ever collected by drilling into a rock on @entity4			0
@entity2 's @entity1 used the @entity125 to take this photo in july			2
the mission 's project scientist , said : ' we now know @entity4 offered favorable conditions for microbial life billions of years ago			2
it has been gratifying to succeed , but that has also whetted our appetites to learn more ' the mission 's project scientist , @entity133 of the @entity135 in @entity136 , said : ' we now know @entity4 offered favorable conditions for microbial life billions of years ago			2
' ' it has been gratifying to succeed , but that has also whetted our appetites to learn more			0
' we hope those enticing layers at @entity90 will preserve a broad diversity of other environmental conditions that could have affected habitability			0
' the rover is also gathering information that might pave the way for a human mission to @entity4 in the future and is measuring natural radiation levels and weather on the surface of @entity4			0
curiosity appears as a bluish dot near the lower right corner of this view of @entity4 from @entity2 's @entity155			1
the rover 's tracks are visible extending from the landing site in the left half of the scene			0
two bright , relatively blue spots surrounded by darker patches are where the @entity165 spacecraft 's landing jets cleared away reddish surface dust at the landing site the mission also found evidence @entity4 lost most of its original atmosphere through processes that occurred at the top of the atmosphere			0
@entity2 's next mission to @entity4 , @entity175 ( @entity175 ) , is being prepared for launch in november to study those processes in the upper atmosphere			1
members of the team behind curiosity at @entity36 in @entity182 will re-live the dramatic landing and mission in a programme that will air on @entity186 and @entity36 's website at 10.45 to 12 pm today			0
another event on @entity186 from noon until 1.30pm will feature @entity2 officials and crew members aboard the @entity191 as they observe the rover anniversary and discuss how its activities and other robotic projects are helping prepare for a human mission to @entity4 and an asteroid .			2
