by @entity1 reporter published : 12:47 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 12:49 est , 8 august 2012 @entity2 has made yet another gaffe by confusing ‘ @entity6 ’ and ‘ @entity8 ’ whilst talking about the massacre at a @entity7 @entity6 temple			1
the @entity10 presidential candidate twice confused the two terms and referred to the victims as the ‘ @entity8 people ’ who had been worshipping in a ‘ @entity8 temple ’			1
@entity8 is a @entity17 term for the leader of a tribe or village			1
confused : @entity10 presidential candidate @entity2 , seen in @entity21 on wednesday , twice confused the ' @entity6 ' and ' @entity8 ' whilst talking about the recent shooting at a @entity7 @entity6 temple @entity6 are not @entity17 , although they have complained repeatedly about being confused for them since the 9/11 attacks , which were carried out by @entity25			1
the blunder is the latest in a string of gaffes after @entity2 caused deep offence in @entity30 and @entity31 on a recent foreign tour			1
it came during a tribute to the six people who were killed and the three who were critically injured during the rampage at the @entity38 of @entity7 in @entity39			1
gunman @entity40 was shot dead at the scene			1
reflection : mourners are seen during a candlelight vigil outside of the @entity45 on tuesday after six were killed by a gunman at the @entity8 temple different faiths : two victims of the shooting are pictured at a memorial for the @entity53 sikhs , who are not @entity17 but widely confused as being so since 9/11 at a fundraising event in @entity55 said : ‘ we had a moment of silence in honour of the people who lost their lives at that sheikh temple			1
i noted that it was a tragedy for many , many reasons			1
' it 's hard to know just how well it will turn out ... there are a few things that were disconcerting ' - on @entity70 hosting the @entity71 last july 2			2
‘ i ’m also unemployed ' - speaking to job hunters in @entity74 in june , 2011 3			2
' i like being able to fire people who provide services to me ' - speaking last january in @entity77 4			2
' i ’m not concerned about the very poor			2
we have a safety net there ' - in an interview in @entity74 last february 5			2
' we 're going to hang [ @entity82 ] with that			0
you have to be careful these days ' - in april 2011 in @entity77 ‘ among them are the fact that people , the sheikh people , are among the most peaceable and loving individuals you can imagine , as is their faith			0
’ @entity2 's spokesman @entity91 said the error was simply because the candidate ‘ mis - spoke ’			0
he said : ‘ he mispronounced similar sounding words			0
he was clearly referring to the tragedy in @entity7 ’			1
on his recent foreign tour , his first foreign trip as a presidential candidate , @entity2 was branded ‘ @entity101 ’ and ‘ @entity102 ’ by the @entity30 for suggesting the @entity99 would be a failure			0
@entity2 , who has been credited with rescuing the 2002 @entity103 , was also attacked by @entity30 prime minister @entity104 who said it was unfair to compare having @entity106 in @entity70 with hosting the event in a city which is ‘ in the middle of nowhere ’			0
@entity2 also had to play down comments by one of his advisors that he understood the relationship between the @entity115 and the @entity30 better than president @entity82 because he appreciated its shared ‘ @entity117 heritage ’			0
during a subsequent stop in @entity119 @entity2 was condemned as ‘ racist ’ by @entity120 for suggesting that @entity119 was succeeding in comparison to its @entity123 neighbours he said : ‘ and as i come here and i look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation , i recognise the power of at least culture and a few other things ’			0
@entity2 caused further outrage by saying that @entity132 was the capital of @entity119 - @entity120 consider the @entity134 half of the city to be theirs but it has been occupied by @entity119 since 1967			0
campaigning : @entity2 's latest gaffe came during a fundraising event in @entity21 , where he also looked at corn with @entity21 secretary of agriculture @entity139 ( center ) and farmer @entity141 ( left ) misspoke : a @entity2 spokesperson said the error was simply because the candidate misspoke and was clearly referring to the tragedy in @entity7 if @entity2 continues making such blunders he is in danger of overtaking @entity148 as the most gaffe - prone politician in @entity115 politics			1
the vice president caused blushing all round in march when made a crass gag about lubrication whilst at a @entity157 reception for @entity159 prime minister @entity158			0
at his first campaign rally with president @entity82 after being selected as his running mate for the 2008 @entity115 election , @entity148 told a crowd : ‘ a man i 'm proud to call my friend			0
a man who will be the next @entity167 - @entity166 ! ’ during another town hall meeting in @entity169 , @entity77 , @entity148 also said that @entity171 , who ran for the @entity173 nomination in 2008 but lost out to mr @entity82 , ‘ might have been a better pick than me ’ as vice president .			0
