the clocks will go back in the early hours of tomorrow morning , officially marking the end of @entity3 summertime it 's that time of year again when the cold , winter nights draw in and we say goodbye to @entity3 summertime			1
the @entity3 will return to @entity7 ( gmt ) when the clocks turn back an hour at 2am tomorrow morning - giving us an extra hour in bed			1
it means tomorrow will be a 25 - hour day with the sun rising and setting an hour earlier than today , meaning the mornings will be lighter			1
during @entity14 ( bst ) the time advances an hour to allow for extra daylight in the evenings			2
the idea was first proposed by @entity18 , an @entity19 - born insect specialist and astronomer , in 1895			2
as a shift worker he valued the daylight after - hours for collecting insects and proposed a two - hour daylight saving shift , presenting it in a paper to the @entity28 society			1
but his ideas were never carried through and it was builder @entity31 who put forward another proposal and in 1907 published a pamphlet called @entity35			0
it outlined how during the summer , the mornings were being ' wasted ' by people who were still asleep for most of it and how moving the clocks would encourage people out of bed			2
the notion was picked up by mps who introduced it as a bill in the @entity47 , but it did not become a law - and @entity31 fought for the scheme until he died in 1915			2
a year after his death @entity51 introduced the system as a way to conserve coal during war time - and @entity3 quickly followed suit in may 1916			0
however the decision was not without controversy - farmers and those working in the entertainment industry opposed it			0
while it caused problems for those with clocks which did not have the facility to go backwards without breaking the mechanism , instead owners had to set their watches 11 hours forward			0
despite that , the system has remained in place ever since , apart from an experimental three years between 1968 and 1971 and during the @entity74			0
now it has been claimed that the clocks going back over winter adds £ 24 to the typical household 's yearly energy bill as people switch their lights on sooner			1
throughout the winter months it increases the nation 's winter electricity bills to £ 630million , a study by @entity86 claims			1
during @entity14 ( bst ) the clock goes forward an hour to allow for extra daylight in the evenings the calculation is based on the assumption that the average household uses 30 light bulbs with a mixture of traditional incandescent bulbs , energy - efficient fluorescent bulbs , halogen lights and a few led lights			1
the retailer says that switching entirely to led light 's would see winter lighting bills drop to just £ 2.47			0
@entity103 , from @entity86 , told the @entity104 : ' we ca n't change the fact that the clocks go back , we ca n't change the fact that we 'll be leaving our lights on for longer , but we can change a light bulb			0
' switching to led light bulbs is an easy way of cutting down our energy bills with minimal effort			1
' meanwhile @entity114 could have its own time zone under plans to move the @entity3 to @entity117			0
builder @entity31 put forward the idea of moving the clocks in 1907 after becoming frustrated that people were sleeping through the daylight in the mornings the campaign to shift the @entity3 forward an hour , aligning the nation with most of @entity126 , is supported by a wide range of mps , who claim the change would save lives on the road thanks to extra sunlight			1
@entity114 has been opposed to the change in the past , but campaigners say @entity135 could devolve powers allowing @entity114 to set their own time			0
the clocks are due to go forward again on the last sunday in march 2015 .			0

the nation returns to @entity7 ( gmt ) at 2am tomorrow
it means we will get an extra hour in bed and have a 25 - hour long sunday
notion of daylight saving first proposed in 1895 and introduced in 1916
claims that moving the clocks back adds £ 24 to household 's energy bills
