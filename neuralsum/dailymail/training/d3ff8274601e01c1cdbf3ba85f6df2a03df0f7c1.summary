@entity9 , 58 , of @entity10 , claimed that @entity1 had given her three of his favourite guitars and that some of his other property was jointly owned by her			1

she has lost a court battle with the musician 's family over his will the case had been taken to court to by the will 's executors - @entity1 's daughter @entity32 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 , a lawyer and friend of the musician			1
the items will go to @entity1 's granddaughter , @entity39			1
ms @entity22 , who was not in court for the hearing , was ordered to pay legal costs			0
ms @entity22 , an @entity43 - born artist , met the singer , originally from @entity45 , near @entity46 , at a restaurant in @entity49 's @entity48 about two years before his death at 63 in january last year			2
they hit it off immediately and he moved to @entity55 , near @entity56 , to be near the mother - of - three , before the couple moved into a large rented house together nearby			0
court battle : ms @entity22 claimed that @entity1 had given her three of his favourite guitars and that some of his other property was jointly owned by her she said it was during the months before his death that @entity1 , who had struggled with an alcohol problem , made a series of gifts to her , as well as purchasing items for their joint use			1
the items , which included three valuable guitars , a @entity74 piano , electric keyboard , 13 @entity76 , 22 @entity78 icons , antique furniture and a @entity20 car , were all kept at their rented home			1
ms @entity22 said the gifts of the guitars and piano were made orally and that @entity1 had been teaching her to play in the months before he died			2
but mr @entity35 said that , after an admission to hospital , the songwriter had asked for some of the items to be returned			0
claim : ms @entity22 argued that a number of @entity1 's possessions should go to her , including a @entity74 piano like the one in this photograph he said that @entity1 , most famous for his 1978 hit @entity2 , had told him he had made no life - time gifts			1
it was also notable , he argued , that ms @entity22 only made her claims after his death and had initially said she owned 11 guitars , before revising that down to three			0
a judge sitting at the @entity101 in @entity49 said there was no contemporaneous evidence of any of the alleged gifts having been made			2
in her ruling , the judge said : ' at no time did the deceased mention that he had gifted any valuable items to the defendant			2
' most importantly , the defendant herself made no such claim until after the deceased ’s death , even at a time when he was asking for return of assets			0
' i order formal release to the claimants of the items , together with appropriate declarations as to ownership			0
' it seems to me that the defendant must pay the costs of this action			0

@entity9 , 58 , claimed musician had given her valuable guitars and artwork
but singer 's family challenged her in the @entity101
other items in dispute included a @entity74 piano , antique furniture and a @entity20 car
