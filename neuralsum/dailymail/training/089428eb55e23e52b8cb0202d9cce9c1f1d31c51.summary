by @entity0 published : 14:34 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 14:36 est , 7 february 2013 dinosaurs vanished earlier than previously thought and ' within a gnat 's eyebrow ' of the cataclysmic meteor impact blamed for their extinction , say scientists			2
corrected dates for both events suggest they occurred almost at the same time , around 66million years ago			2
previous studies indicated that the impact pre-dated the death of the dinosaurs by as much as 300,000 years			1
previous studies suggested that a cataclysmic meteor pre-dated the death of dinosaurs by as much as 300,000 years - but new research shows they occurred within 33,000 years of each other the disaster was probably the ' final straw ' for the dinosaurs but may not have been the only reason the reptiles which ruled the world for more than 150million years died out , scientists believe			1
a 110 - mile crater in the @entity27 off the coast of @entity29 marks the spot where a six - mile - wide object , either an asteroid or comet , smashed into the @entity34			1
clues to the event remain in the form of iridium - enriched dust , glassy spheres and shocked quartz that was spread around the planet			0
scientists used new radioactive dating techniques to determine both the date of the impact and that of the dinosaurs ' extinction			2
the research , published in the journal @entity51 , shows they occurred within 33,000 years of each other			1
a 110 - mile crater in the @entity27 off the coast of @entity29 marks the spot where a six - mile - wide object , either an asteroid or comet , smashed into the @entity34 lead scientist professor @entity58 , from the @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ' the impact was clearly the final straw that pushed @entity34 past the tipping point			1
' we have shown that these events are synchronous to within a gnat 's eyebrow , and therefore the impact clearly played a major role in extinctions , but it probably was n't just the impact			0
' dramatic climate fluctuations over the previous million years , including long cold snaps , may have brought many creatures to the brink of extinction before the meteor struck , he said			0
' these precursory phenomena made the global ecosystem much more sensitive to even small triggers , so that what otherwise might have been a fairly minor effect shifted the ecosystem into a new state , ' prof @entity58 added			0
' the impact was the coup de grace			0
' the researchers also concluded that the @entity34 's atmospheric carbon cycle returned to normal within about 5,000 years of the impact			1
in contrast , it took between one and two million years for the oceans to recover .			0

110 - mile crater off @entity29 marks spot where 6mile - wide object hit @entity34
previous studies showed impact pre-dated death of dinosaurs by as much as 300,000 years
two events now believed to have occurred within 33,000 years of each other
