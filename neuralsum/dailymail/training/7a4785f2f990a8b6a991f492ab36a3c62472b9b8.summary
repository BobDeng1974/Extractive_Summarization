by @entity1 reporter published : 20:09 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 20:11 est , 30 september 2013 ' i do n't believe it ' : grumpy grandads such as @entity5 , played by @entity6 , appear to be on the decline as more aging men say their later years are the best of their lives women are grumpier than men when they reach old age , a survey reveals today			1
the nationwide research appears to challenge the idea of men becoming bad tempered with age - epitomised by the archetypal grumpy old man @entity5 in @entity19			1
both men and women are happiest during middle age but women become more cantankerous the older they get			1
exactly the same number of men and women - 21 per cent - said they felt happiest with their life as a young adult			2
a total of 36 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women said they were most content during middle age			1
but surprisingly , 30 per cent of men said they were the happiest when they passed 65 - compared to just 26 per cent of women			1
the results also found that life does indeed begin at 40 , with 64 per cent saying their happiest times have been from middle age onwards			2
the survey , commissioned by @entity43 manufacturer @entity42 , questioned 1,000 men and women over the age of 65 about the happiest times of their lives			1
just four per cent of men and women said the happiest time of their life was when they were a child and another four per cent said that time was still to come			2
an overwhelming 77 per cent of people quizzed said they think older people can either make a valuable contribution to society or do more if given the chance			0
the research also shows 66 per cent of pensioners think society values elderly people less than they did when they were young , while 60 per cent feel their needs are not understood by the government			0
@entity67 @entity68 , joint managing director of @entity69 , said : ' the results of this research bring out some entertaining comparisons			0
' but on a more serious level they confirm that for most people life really does begin during middle age			0
' whilst at times society may seem to value youth over experience , these results indicate that when it comes to happiness , @entity43 ’s middle aged and over 65s are far more satisfied with life			0
' despite this , it is unnerving to see that @entity43 ’s 10 million over 65s still feel undervalued by society and misunderstood by government			0
' as we celebrate @entity43 @entity90 ’s day we must consider how we can all work together to engage @entity43 ’s over 65s , who are extremely keen to continue contributing positively to society			0

survey suggests old men like @entity5 are on the wane
study *polled* 1,000 men and women over the age of 65
