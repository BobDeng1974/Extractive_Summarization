the first farmers came to @entity1 8,000 years ago and spread early agricultural practices , starting in @entity3			1
but @entity5 @entity1 during the @entity7 period , initially rejected the practice of farming , which was spreading throughout the rest of the continent , researchers claim			2
their findings show a bump in the road in the adoption of farming , which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘ major economic revolution ’			0
experts from @entity22 in the @entity23 and @entity24 ( @entity25 ) in @entity26 studied neolithic ornaments ( pictured ) to understand how farming spread			1
these beads are examples of personal ornaments worn by the first @entity1 farming societies ‘ this discovery goes beyond farming , ’ said @entity33 , the study 's lead author and a researcher at the @entity36 in the @entity23 and @entity24 ( @entity25 ) in @entity26			1
‘ it also reveals two different cultural trajectories that took place in @entity1 thousands of years ago , with southern and central regions advancing in many ways and northern regions maintaining their traditions ’			1
to come to their conclusion , the researchers looked at the adoption or rejection of ornamental beads or bracelets worn by different populations in the early @entity7 period , which stretched from 8,000 to 5,000 bc. based on discoveries of different types of @entity7 ornaments in different parts of @entity1 , they concluded that @entity5 @entity1 in the @entity7 period initially rejected the practice of farming , which was otherwise spreading throughout the continent			1
examples of ornaments worn by @entity1 foraging societies are shown scientists recently discovered that stone - age hunter gatherers in @entity67 were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to @entity70			1
farming is thought to have arrived in @entity70 around 6,000 years ago so experts think that local hunter gatherers bought wheat by trading with @entity1 farmers from as far away as the south of @entity77 or the @entity78			1
this means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the @entity1 continent to @entity70 across an ancient land bridge			1
the scientists say that the discovery shows that @entity70 was no - where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought			0
they say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in @entity70			0
dr @entity90 , a plant geneticist at the @entity91 who led the research , said : ' eight thousand years ago the people of mainland @entity70 were leading a hunter - gatherer existence , whilst at the same time in southern @entity1 farming was gradually spreading across @entity1			1
previous studies have shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments , so by looking at the ornaments , the experts were able to understand the spread of farming practices for the first time			2
they examined some 200 bead - type objects found at more than 400 @entity1 sites over a 3,000 - year period , tracing the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to explain the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming			2
they found that the pathways of the spread of farming over 3,000 years , are less clear than previously thought			2
they found ornaments linked to farmers , such as human - shaped beads and bracelets composed of perforated shells , from eastern @entity3 and the @entity124 to @entity77 ’s @entity125 and from the @entity126 northward to @entity127			0
but the researchers did not find these types of ornaments in the @entity132 region of northern @entity1 , according to the study , published in the journal @entity135			0
this area held on to decorative wear typically used by hunting and foraging populations , such as perforated shells rather than beads or bracelets found in farming communities			0
dr @entity33 explained : ‘ it 's clear hunters and foragers in the @entity132 area resisted the adoption of ornaments worn by farmers during this period			0
‘ we 've therefore concluded that this cultural boundary reflected a block in the advancement of farming - at least during the @entity7 period			0
’ their findings show a bump in the road of the adoption of farming , which enabled groups of people to move away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival and sparked a ‘ major economic revolution ’			0
a stock image of a @entity7 hut , which may have been used by early farmers in modern day @entity77 , is shown			0
