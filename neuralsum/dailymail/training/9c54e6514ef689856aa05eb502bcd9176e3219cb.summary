economical : @entity2 - fired sources of heating have become increasingly popular to cut heating costs , with 200,000 stoves installed a year they are in hot demand among @entity7 hoping to save money on energy bills			2
but trendy wood - burning stoves are fuelling air pollution , scientists warn			1
research shows levels of a particularly nasty form of pollution surge during winter when stoves and open fires are lit. @entity2 - fired sources of heating have become increasingly popular to cut heating costs , with 200,000 stoves installed a year			2
estate agents say they can add up to 5 per cent to a house ’s value			1
they are also seen as environmentally friendly because carbon dioxide released by burning wood is taken up by young trees – making the fuel carbon neutral			1
as a result , homeowners can get government subsidies if they install wood - fired boilers			0
but wood may not be as green as it seems			0
scientists from @entity33 say burning wood generates particulates – minuscule particles that can raise the risk of heart disease , trigger asthma and shorten lives			1
their research shows levels surge during winter evenings – when wood - burning accounts for 13 per cent of particulates in the air in some @entity7 cities			1
in some hot spots , the pollution is comparable to that from traffic fumes			0
researcher dr @entity51 told the @entity52 : ‘ although the apparent carbon neutrality of wood may make it appear environmentally friendly , there is growing evidence of adverse health effects from wood smoke			0
‘ domestic wood burning takes place where people live and at times when they are at home			1
‘ coupled with still night - time conditions even modest wood - burning in urban areas may lead to particulate exposures comparable to those from traffic sources			2
‘ we need to manage urban emissions to ensure increased wood - burning does not offset schemes to reduce traffic pollution			2
’ lethal : scientists from @entity33 say burning wood generates particulates – minuscule particles that can raise the risk of heart disease , trigger asthma and shorten lives the @entity82 , which represents manufacturers , said that modern stoves are greener than their predecessors			1
@entity86 , the association ’s deputy chairman , said : ‘ @entity2 - fired stoves are a genuinely green and carbon neutral way of heating your home , which can save you money and make you less dependent on the big energy companies			0
‘ modern stoves are very efficient and clean , with about 14 milligrams of particulate per cubic metre of air			0
‘ @entity99 compares to 100mg five years ago			0
’ the @entity100 said that the technology has ‘ an important role to play in transforming the way we heat our homes			0
