by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:17 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 15 october 2013 for more than 30 years @entity2 sailed the oceans as a powerful symbol of @entity6 's proud maritime history			2
but today ministers raised the prospect that @entity2 could meet an undignified end in a wrecking yard being turned into tin cans and razor blades			2
now they have issued a desperate plea to anyone with a few million pounds to spare to buy the 22,000 - tonne warship and turn it into a tourist attraction			1
warning : ministers are desperate to find a buyer for @entity2 to prevent her facing an undignified end being broken up for scrap ministers last year promised the 25,000 - tone floating fortress would be preserved as a lasting tribute to the @entity26 's invincible - class aircraft carriers when it completes active service in 2014			1
the pledge came after her two sister warships - invincible , and @entity31 - were both controversially sold for scrap metal for around £ 3million			1
defence minister @entity33 played down concerns at the time that an important part of the @entity6 's naval heritage would be lost by insisting : ' it is important that we preserve the legacy of the invincible - class aircraft carriers			1
' but today mr @entity41 admitted it could also end up on the scrap heap unless a benefactor can be found			2
he said the vessel , currently serving as a helicopter carrier on military war games in the @entity48 , could be broken up unless a buyer comes forward to preserve it as a tourist attraction			1
huge : the 210 - metre ( 689ft ) long ship - based in @entity52 - was built by @entity53 on @entity54 and launched in 1978 in a @entity57 statement he warned the carrier could be sold for recycling if no suitable bids were received			1
he said : ' @entity2 , the last of these three iconic ships , is due to retire from service with the @entity26 in 2014			0
' the @entity65 's @entity64 ( @entity64 ) has launched a competition which will seek innovative re-use bids to retain the ship in the @entity6 , with part or all of it developed for heritage purposes			0
' he said organisations would be expected to put forward ' mature and viable proposals , in keeping with the role and history of the invincible class of ships '			1
proposals to turn @entity2 - nicknamed @entity80 - into a floating museum and tourist attraction to lure thousands of visitors are already being drawn up			1
in 2006 , the crew of @entity2 spelt out the message ' @entity86 ' to mark the @entity88 's birthday stepping out : the @entity88 and the @entity89 on board illustrious during a state visit to @entity92 in 2005 but mr @entity33 warned : ' in the event that no suitable re-use bids with a heritage element are submitted , the @entity64 will open up the competition by seeking proposals for other uses or recycling			0
' the ship is 210 - metre ( 689ft ) - the equivalent of 18 double - decker buses			2
based in @entity52 , was built by @entity53 on @entity54 and launched in 1978			0
she relieved @entity104 in the @entity105 after the 1982 conflict and was involved in the @entity107 and the conflict in @entity109 in 2001 , and supported evacuations from @entity111 in 2000 and @entity112 in 2006			0
@entity2 was converted to be used as the navy 's helicopter carrier following the government 's decision to sell the @entity118 jets which operated from its flightdeck			0
the decision left the @entity26 without an aircraft carrier until the new queen elizabeth class enters service later this decade			0
@entity124 , which is almost complete , will begin sea trials in 2017 before undertaking flight trials with the @entity129 aircraft in 2018 .			0
