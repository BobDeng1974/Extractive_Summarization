but the sore continued to go unnoticed until @entity35 - nearly two months after the incident			1
she died just over a week later at the hospital on january 3 , 2013			0
mr @entity28 concluded that two factors contributed to mrs @entity6 ' death - the burns she suffered as a result of the commode and the delay in treatment this caused for her pressure sore			1
he said staff had failed to spot the sore because her burns were so severe she found it painful when moved			2
speaking after the inquest in @entity52 , @entity5 , mrs @entity50 ' family slammed the ' shocking standard of care ' she received			1
they said : ' the death of @entity6 was not just avoidable or preventable but needless and unnecessary			0
' there can be no doubt that the sub-optimum care , together with the scald incident itself , resulted in unnecessary , needless and prolonged suffering			0
' the verdict has been a long time coming but unfortunately it has all been too little , too late			0
mrs @entity6 suffered horrific burns after a carer at the @entity9 ( pictured ) in @entity10 , @entity5 asked her to sit on a commode of boiling water ' @entity6 has died			1
nothing can bring her back or undo the harm she suffered			0

they said she never returned home after injuring her wrist and was placed straight into the care home by the hospital			0
@entity82 , representing the family , told the court that mrs @entity6 developed a pressure sore in october 2012 , which ' was n't managed properly '			1
referring to the burns she suffered from the commode , she said : ' no practice was in place to allow that procedure to take place			2
' it was inherently risky and dangerous and the water was n't tested and the pressure sore was under - assessed by district nurses			1
' due to the burns , she was unable to move properly and risk of further pressure sores heightened			0
' the district nurse was n't made aware and there was a lack of communication that clearly led to difficulties moving forward			0
' mr @entity28 said : ' @entity6 was placed in a commode in her room at her care home in the hope steam would ease constipation			2
the coroner concluded that two factors contributed to mrs @entity6 ' death - the burns she suffered as a result of the commode and the delay in treatment this caused for her pressure sore ' this unintentionally resulted in burns and scalds			1
' on november 21 , she was examined but that did n't include assessment of her left hip area and she deteriorated			0
' on november 23 , she was hospitalised and it was not until december 24 that the injury to her left hip was recognised as a pressure sore			2
' there was a delay in treatment which could have affected the outcome			0
' i do n't find failings at the care home as a whole , aside from the action of the individual carer who utilised the commode			2
' mr @entity28 returned a narrative verdict and accepted evidence given by dr @entity142 , a pathologist at the @entity34 , who reported the cause of death as being bronchial pneumonia due to necrotic , chronic pressure ulcer to the left hip and burns or scalds to the buttock			2
a pre-inquest hearing earlier this year revealed police had spoken to the carer , who poured boiling water into the commode , and the @entity157 about the incident at the the care home			1
but it was decided the care worker should not be prosecuted			0
