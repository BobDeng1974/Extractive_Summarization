by @entity1 @entity0 it 's the genetically modified fruit from @entity1 that could turn @entity4 nations into life - saving banana republics			1
@entity7 ( @entity7 ) researchers have engineered bananas grown in far north @entity9 to increase the levels of beta - carotene , which is converted to vitamin a in the body			1
the researchers say their goal is to stop thousands of @entity16 children , and those from surrounding countries , from going blind and dying from @entity19 deficiencies			1
with the researchers having now successfully bent the banana genome , the genetically modified fruit is being tested on humans for the first time			2
life - saving banana republics : a research team from @entity1 's @entity7 have engineered bananas grown in far north @entity9 to increase vitamin a levels in the body thousands of children in @entity16 and surrounding countries are deficient in the vitamin about 10 kilograms of the orange - fleshed yellow fruit , grown near @entity32 , about 90 kilometres south of @entity33 , has just been shipped to @entity34 , where the trials are being conducted			1
five @entity16 phd students have been working with project leader professor @entity37 on the nine - year project , which received $ 10 million from the @entity39			1
life - saving : with vitamin a deficiencies leading to blindness and premature death for children under six years old in @entity16 , the genetically engineered fruit could potentially be life - saving according to professor @entity37 , vitamin a-enriched banana varieties will be grown by @entity16 farmers by 2020			1
about 70 per cent of the @entity16 population survive on bananas			2
' the @entity53 or @entity4 cooking banana , which is chopped and steamed , is a staple food of many @entity4 nations , but it has low levels of micronutrients , particularly pro-vitamin a and iron , ' professor @entity37 said			0
' we 're aiming to increase the level of pro-vitamin a to a minimum level of 20 micrograms per gram dry weight			0
' according to the @entity65 , @entity19 deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and is especially severe in @entity69 , where people are the poorest			0
many children affected by @entity19 deficiencies in @entity69 do n't survive beyond six years old			0
previous trials using @entity75 gerbils had already proved successful on the bananas			0
if the field trials in @entity16 are a success , professor @entity37 said the same technology could be transferred to countries such as @entity81 , and parts of the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
according to the @entity65 , @entity19 deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and is especially severe in @entity69			0

genetically engineered bananas contain *higher* levels of vitamin a
thousands of children in @entity16 and surrounding countries are deficient in the vitamin
nine - year project received $ 10 million from @entity97 and @entity98
*expected* to be grown by @entity16 farmers by 2020
