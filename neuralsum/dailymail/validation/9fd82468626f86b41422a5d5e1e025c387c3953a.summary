president @entity0 is alleged to have stopped an @entity2 military attack against @entity4 's nuclear facilities in 2014 by threatening to shoot down @entity2 jets before they could reach their targets , according to reports to emerge from the @entity8 at the weekend the threat from the @entity10 forced prime minister @entity11 to abort a planned attack on @entity13 , reported @entity15 newspaper @entity14			1
@entity11 will be in @entity16 for an address to @entity18 on tuesday aimed squarely at derailing @entity0 's cherished bid for a diplomatic deal with @entity21			1
the @entity11 government took the decision to strike @entity4 last year after discovering that the @entity10 and @entity4 were involved in secret talks over @entity4 's nuclear program and were about to sign an agreement in that regard behind @entity2 's back			1
the report claimed that an unnamed @entity2 minister who has good ties with the @entity10 administration revealed the attack plan to secretary of state @entity42 , and that @entity0 then threatened to shoot down the @entity2 jets before they could reach their targets in @entity4			1
according to the report , ' @entity11 and his commanders agreed after four nights of deliberations to task the @entity2 army 's chief of staff , @entity49 , to prepare a qualitative operation against @entity4 's nuclear program			1
' in addition , @entity11 and his ministers decided to do whatever they could do to thwart a possible agreement between @entity4 and the @entity56 because such an agreement is , allegedly , a threat to @entity2 's security			1
' for six years , president @entity0 and @entity11 have been on a collision course over how to halt @entity4 's nuclear ambitions , a high - stakes endeavor both men see as a centerpiece of their legacies the sources added that @entity49 and his commanders prepared the requested plan and that @entity2 fighter jets trained for several weeks in order to make sure the plans would work successfully			1
@entity2 fighter jets reportedly even carried out experimental flights in @entity4 's airspace after they managed to break through radars			1
stopping @entity4 from building a nuclear bomb has become a defining challenge for both @entity0 and @entity11 , yet one they have approached far differently			1
for @entity0 , getting @entity4 to verifiably prove it is not pursuing nuclear weapons would be a bright spot in a foreign policy arena in which numerous outcomes are uncertain and would validate his early political promise to negotiate with @entity4 without conditions			2
@entity11 considers unacceptable any deal with @entity4 that does n't end its nuclear program entirely and opposes the diplomatic pursuit as one that minimizes what he considers an existential threat to @entity2			2
@entity21 says its nuclear program is peaceful and exists only to produce energy for civilian use			0
prime minister @entity11 was forced to abort a planned attack on @entity13 after the @entity10 threatened to shoot down @entity2 jets ' through scaremongering , falsification , propaganda and creating a false atmosphere even inside other countries , ( @entity2 ) is attempting to prevent peace , ' @entity4 's top nuclear negotiator said on saturday in @entity21			1
' i believe that these attempts are in vain and should not impede reaching a ( nuclear ) agreement , ' said foreign minister @entity106			0
@entity10 and @entity4 officials reported progress in the latest talks on a deal that would freeze @entity21 's nuclear program for 10 years , but allow it to slowly ramp up in the final years of the accord			1
@entity0 has refused to meet @entity11 during his visit , with the @entity56 citing its policy of not meeting with foreign leaders soon before their elections			2
vice president @entity117 and @entity42 will both be out of the country on trips announced only after @entity11 accepted the @entity121 offer to speak on @entity122			0
the prime minister is scheduled to speak on monday at @entity125 's annual policy conference			0
the @entity0 administration will be represented at the event by @entity129 ambassador @entity128 and national security adviser @entity130 , who criticized @entity11 's plans to address @entity18 as ' destructive ' to the @entity10 - @entity2 relationship			1
the @entity4 dispute has spotlighted rifts in a relationship that has been frosty from the start			0
@entity0 and @entity11 lack any personal chemistry , leaving them with virtually no reservoir of goodwill to get them through their policy disagreements			2
activists rally and protest outside @entity145 on 6th ave and 48th @entity147 to protest the visit of @entity2 prime minister @entity11 , who is scheduled to address @entity18 on tuesday within months of taking office , @entity0 irritated @entity2 when , in an address to the @entity152 world , he challenged the legitimacy of @entity155 settlements on @entity157 - claimed land and cited the @entity158 as the justification for @entity2 's existence , not any historical @entity155 tie to the land			1
the @entity56 was furious when @entity11 's government defied @entity0 and announced plans to construct new housing units in @entity166 while @entity117 was visiting @entity2 in 2010			1
additional housing plans that year upended @entity10 efforts to restart peace talks between the @entity2 and @entity157			2
the tension between @entity0 and @entity11 was laid bare in an unusually public manner during an @entity173 meeting in 2011			0
in front of a crowd of journalists , the prime minister lectured @entity0 at length on @entity2 's history and dismissed the president 's conditions for restarting peace talks			2
later that year , a microphone caught @entity0 telling his then - @entity185 counterpart in a private conversation that while he may be fed up with @entity11 , ' you are sick of him , but i have to work with him every day			0
' despite suspecting that @entity11 was cheering for his rival in the 2012 presidential campaign , @entity0 tried to reset relations with the prime minister after his re-election			0
he made his first trip as president to @entity2 and the two leaders went to great lengths to put on a happy front , referring to each other by their first names and touring some of the region 's holy sites together			0
an anti-israel demonstrators wearing masks bearing the likeness of @entity2 prime minister @entity11 and holding up ' bloody ' hands in a protest outside the @entity208 on sunday the healing period was to be short - lived			0
another attempt at @entity2 - @entity157 peace talks collapsed			0
@entity2 officials were withering in their criticism of @entity42 , who had shepherded the talks , with the country 's defense minister calling him ' obsessive ' and ' messianic			0
' the @entity0 administration returned the favor last summer with its own unusually unsparing criticism of @entity2 for causing civilian deaths when war broke out in @entity223			0
the @entity10 and @entity2 have hit rocky patches before			0
the settlement issue has been a persistent thorn in relations , compounded by profound unhappiness in @entity16 over @entity2 military operations in the @entity230 , @entity13 and @entity231 during the @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 administrations that led those presidents to take or consider direct punitive measures			1
yet through it all , the @entity10 has remained @entity2 's prime benefactor , providing it with $ 3 billion a year in assistance and defending it from criticism at the @entity129 and elsewhere			2
' we have brought relations back in the past and we will do it again now because at the end of the day they are based on mutual interests , ' said @entity247 , a former @entity2 ambassador to the @entity129 and informal adviser to @entity11			0
' the interests of @entity2 and the @entity10 are similar and sometime identical and i think that is what will determine in the end and not feelings of one kind or another			0

president @entity0 is alleged to have thwarted an @entity2 military attack against @entity4 's nuclear facilities in 2014
the @entity10 threatened to shoot down @entity2 jets before they could reach their targets and so @entity11 aborted his plans to attack @entity13
@entity11 will *appears* in @entity16 for an address to @entity18 on tuesday aimed squarely at derailing @entity0 's cherished bid
