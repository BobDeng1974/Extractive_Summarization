by @entity0 published : 02:20 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 22 august 2013 according to the modern man , the height of romance is giving their partner control of the tv remote			0
the answer appears in the top ten romantic gestures as voted by 2000 @entity10 men and women in a recent survey			1
after sacrificing the remote control , the other top choices from the men included offering to clean the house ( 11 per cent ) , putting the bins out ( seven per cent ) and leaving the toilet seat down ( seven per cent )			1
i love you this much : @entity10 men said they thought it was romantic to relinquish control of the tv remote washing the dishes and doing the ironing was also rated as a ' romantic ' thing to do			1
however , it seems not all men are oblivious of how to keep romance alive as 37 per cent voted for surprising their partner with bouquet of flowers while 31 per cent opted for offering to cook the dinner			1
both of these answers were the women 's top choices for a romantic gesture followed by being run a hot bath			1
managing director @entity42 , from @entity43 , who commissioned the research , said : ' a nice bunch of flowers is usually what women want but perhaps us men are a bit guilty of trying to think outside the box too much and i guess that 's why some think that the remote is the key to being romantic			1
' way to her heart : a surprise bunch of flowers and having dinner cooked for them was a welcome romantic gesture voted for by the women however , some of the men admitted they felt wary of presenting a bouquet to their loved one in case it made them appear guilty of something			1
a fifth believed that their partner would get suspicious if they give them flowers when it was n't a special occasion			0
the @entity78 were the most likely to fear suspicion with 13 per cent highlighting this was a worry , compared to just eight per cent in the south west of @entity82			0
it was something they need n't be worried about as only seven per cent of partners said they would be suspicious			0
when it comes to flowers , roses were the favourite choice for more than a quarter of women , followed by lilies			2
the study also found it 's been almost two months since men got it right in the romance department , with women even having to tell their partner what they think is romantic to get what they want			1
three in five ( 60 per cent ) of the @entity10 's long suffering females have to leave subtle hints around the house so their partner gets it right			2
meanwhile , more than a third said they had to be very blunt and come straight out with it			0
it 's not just men that are getting it wrong however ; two in five women have to be told what their man finds romantic as well			2
chocolates and flowers were found to be the most common gift both men and women receive from their partners			2
but while many believe that a gift from their other half should be worth £ 84.21 , those @entity123 then go on to admit they only spend half of that ( £ 42.65 ) when dipping into their own pockets for their partner			0
the research also discovered that @entity128 have the highest expectation from a gift , saying £ 102.36 is a reasonable amount to be spent on them , compared to those in the @entity134 , who are happy to receive something worth £ 72.67			0
those between the ages of 45 - 54 were found to be the most generous , with their most expensive gift costing £ 368.17 .			0
