by @entity0 surgeons have designed a new operation which they hope could prevent the development of arthritis and extend sporting careers			1
the procedure , which is currently being trialled at @entity7 , involves coating damaged cartilage with stem cells , taken from a patient ’s own hip , and surgical glue			1
if successful , it will regenerate the remaining tissue and create a permanent ' like - for - like ' replacement for the first time			1
surgeons at @entity7 have pioneered a new operation to treat knee injuries , which they hope will extend sporting careers			0
@entity22 striker @entity21 had an operation to remove his damaged meniscus , part of the cartilage in the knee , prior to the @entity28 cartilage is a tough , flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints and enables bones to slide over one another while reducing friction and acting as a shock absorber			1
damage to the tissue in the knee is common and occurs mainly following sudden twists or direct blows , such as falls or heavy tackles playing sports such as football and rugby , but can also develop over time through gradual wear and tear			2
around 10,000 people a year in the @entity50 suffer cartilage damage serious enough to require treatment due to pain , ' locking ' and reduced flexibility			0
if left untreated , it can progress to arthritis and severely impair leg movement			0
@entity22 footballer @entity21 had an operation to remove damaged meniscus , a type of cartilage , from his left knee			2
patients who undergo the @entity65 operation first have the cartilage cut and tidied and undergo a technique called microfracture			0
this involves trimming any remaining damaged tissue and drilling holes in the bone beneath the defect via keyhole surgery			2
the cartilage tissue is then coated with a substance made up of bone marrow cells , platelet gel and hyaluronic acid			2
during the 30 - minute procedure , the bone marrow sample is spun in a centrifuge in the operating theatre to give a concentrated amount of the patient ’s own stem cells			1
these cells are then mixed with the gel and acid to create a ' glue ' substance which is placed over the cartilage defect and allowed to set			0
the controversial @entity94 striker , 27 , felt pain in his knee during training with his international squad in @entity98 in may			0
other sports stars known to have suffered knee injuries include rugby player @entity101 , as well as footballers @entity102 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
the new surgical technique is known as @entity107 of @entity108			0
@entity109 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity7 and lead researcher , said : ' the development of this technique and the study we are conducting could revolutionise the treatment of common cartilage injury by creating a like - for - like , identical cartilage replacement for the first time			1
' so far , treatments developed to combat the long - term problems associated with cartilage damage have had varied outcomes , resulting in knee pain for many people in older age and shortened careers for many amateur and professional sports players			0
' mr @entity109 added : ' at present , although the removal of damaged cartilage and microfracture surgery can provide a short - term solution , the chances , particularly for sports players , of developing arthritis in later life or requiring ongoing treatment remain high			1
' currently , the most commonly used procedure to repair the injury - microfracture - involves trimming any remaining damaged tissue and drilling holes in the bone beneath the defect via keyhole surgery to promote bleeding and scar tissue to work as a substitute			1
the procedure involves involves coating damaged cartilage with stem cells , taken from a patient 's own hip			1
if successful it will then regenerate creating a permanent replacement			1
right , shows an image of inflamed cartilage in a knee joint however , the technique has variable results , with studies in the @entity160 suggesting the procedure offers only a short term benefit ( the first 24 months after surgery ) , and does not lead to the formation of new cartilage			0
patients who undergo the @entity65 operation have the cartilage cut and tidied and undergo microfracture , but their cartilage tissue is then coated with a substance made up of bone marrow cells , platelet gel and hyaluronic acid			2
during the 30 - minute procedure , the bone marrow sample is spun in a centrifuge in the operating theatre to give a concentrated amount of the patient ’s own stem cells			1
these cells are then mixed with the gel and acid to create a ' glue ' substance which is placed over the cartilage defect and allowed to set			0
the study at @entity7 will compare the results of 40 patients aged between 18 and 65 years , half of whom will undergo @entity65 and half microfracture alone .			0

if successful , it will regenerate the remaining tissue , creating a permanent ' like - for - like ' replacement for the first time
