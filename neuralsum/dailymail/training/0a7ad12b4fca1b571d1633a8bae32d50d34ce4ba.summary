by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the sight of @entity3 on one knee with arms spread wide at @entity6 and then standing in triumph after running out @entity8 at the @entity9 are iconic @entity11 images			1
now , against all the odds , the man they call @entity3 is going to be back in professional cricket , five long years after that triumphant swansong			1
iconic : @entity3 celebrates dismissal of @entity18 at @entity6 in the 2009 @entity11 series @entity21 ’s confirmation on friday that @entity3 , now 36 , will play @entity23 cricket this summer — probably starting with next friday ’s @entity24 — is an extraordinary development in the eventful life of a highly significant cricketer			1
anyone who could even have suggested that he would be able to play at county level again when he hobbled off into the south @entity31 sunset that fabled day at @entity9 in 2009 would have been laughed at , not least by @entity3 himself			1
that he is physically fit enough and seemingly free of the chronic knee and ankle problems that so ravaged his @entity35 career is to his credit			2
there is no doubt that @entity3 will put thousands on the gate wherever he plays			1
having a blast : @entity3 enjoys time in the @entity21 nets on friday sign him up : @entity3 makes his return for @entity21 official with the county 's cricket director @entity45 his return is a huge boost for the revamped @entity49 and to the domestic game at a time when @entity53 cricket is at its lowest ebb after an @entity11 whitewash , something that @entity3 knows all about from being captain in 2006 - 07			1
‘ it is something that i never thought would happen , ’ admitted @entity3			1
‘ but after training with the squad over the past few months i ’m really happy they have invited me to play			2
i have worked really hard to get back to my fittest and i hope we have a successful summer			2
i ’m just glad i can be part of it			0
’ it is , of course , wise to be cautious about a cricketer who had so many injury problems and @entity3 needs to come through a club game for @entity71 this weekend and a second - team match next thursday before he is fully ready			1
banter : @entity3 shares a joke with former team - mate @entity75 famous face : @entity3 will make his comeback to cricket for @entity21 in the @entity49 putting his back into it : @entity3 will play a 2nd @entity82 game for @entity21 next week and will then play in the @entity83 yet a cricketer who is clearly fitter and leaner now than in his prime , thanks perhaps to his excursion into boxing as part of his diverse cricketing after - life , has worked hard to be ready for this			1
nothing seems likely to stop him now			0
not many sporting stars have the opportunity to go out on top , as @entity3 truly did five years ago , and there will be those who will be keeping their fingers crossed that this comeback does not end in @entity101 has clearly missed the game and would love his children to see him play			1
it is that motivation which has led to this , even though a twisted ankle two weeks ago kept his comeback on ice — quite literally			0
the moment when @entity109 told him they did not want him to play in their star - studded bicentenary game at @entity6 in july , as revealed by @entity112 in @entity113 , crystalised @entity3 ’s determination to come back			1
‘ @entity117 from @entity109 phoned me and i thought it was to tell me where to turn up and who else would be in the side , ’ said @entity3 in a @entity116 interview			2
‘ my kids were in the car and he told me he did n’t want me			0
he said they had @entity124 and all these other people			0
the return : @entity21 have announced @entity3 's return ' they ’re all 10 years older than me and they have n’t played for years ”			1
i saw my kids ’ faces and it was the first time they ’d seen their dad told he could n’t do something			0
they said , “ never mind , there will be other games ” and i thought , “ there will be , actually ”			0
‘ i was getting knocked back and wanting to play , practising and realising “ i can still do this ”			2
and there is unfinished business from when i retired			0
i ’d sooner have a go and have it not come off than sit at home for the rest of my days thinking , “ i should have tried it , i should have had a go ”			0
i do n’t live my life like that			0
’ @entity3 , whose friendship with @entity21 captain and interim coach @entity149 facilitated the move , admitted his return to the nets has not been pain free			1
‘ when i ’m bowling it still hurts a bit , ’ he said			0
‘ but i ’m loving running in and if i can take that into a game i might be dangerous			0
‘ i do n’t want this to be one year			0
you see @entity161 playing in the @entity162 , @entity158 is playing for @entity163 at 39 and @entity149 is 40 and still charging in for @entity21 in four - day games			2
’ it would be stretching a point to believe @entity3 could again play in @entity168 cricket or , as will inevitably be speculated , for @entity35 in @entity23			1
yet he is clearly serious about doing himself justice for @entity21 and that must surely be a good thing for both him and his county			2
we wish him well .			0

@entity3 set to return for @entity21 in @entity23 match against @entity176
his return is a huge boost for the revamped @entity49
@entity3 has missed cricket and would love his children to see him play
