by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:01 est , 16 november 2013 @entity4 : 11:53 est , 16 november 2013 after spending nearly seven hours explaining ' in great detail ' his claims of the harassment he suffered in the @entity10 locker room , ' bullied ' offensive tackle @entity11 says he plans to continue his career in the @entity13			1
@entity11 met with league officials and @entity13 investigator @entity15 on friday to discuss the alleged bullying he suffered at the hands of teammate @entity18 - and others - that ultimately led to his leaving the team last month to seek treatment for depression			1
following the meeting , the 6 - foot - 5 , 312 pound @entity11 declined comment on the details of the meeting , only saying that he planned to return to professional football			1
' this is the right way to handle the situation			0
' @entity11 went on to say that , ' beyond that , i look forward to working through the process and resuming my career in the @entity13			1
' @entity11 still could sue the @entity10 for big money under a variety of workplace laws , and could turn to his own legal eagle mother - and attorney specializing in employment law - for advice			1
the employment legislation makes employers liable for bullying , harassment and discrimination - even if the team 's hierarchy did n't know about it , according to several legal experts			0
@entity10 owner @entity59 also plans to meet with @entity11 at a later date			1
moving forward : @entity11 declined to discuss what he shared with @entity13 investigators , only saying he wanted to move forward and continue his career in the @entity13 @entity11 's mother , @entity64 , spent almost 20 years practicing employment law and wrote numerous articles in legal journals on such issues as workplace discrimination and harassment			1
it 's not known whether she has any role in her son 's decisions ; @entity75 is now assistant general counsel for @entity76 in @entity77			1
the league currently is trying to gather information about the harassment @entity11 says he was subjected to by @entity18 to determine an appropriate penalty and remedy to what several @entity13 players have described as a ' culture ' of bullying in @entity13 locker rooms			1
suing the @entity10 could be more successful than bringing criminal charges against @entity18 , who was suspended by the @entity10 after @entity11 left the team two and a half weeks ago			1
@entity11 's attorney , @entity89 , says @entity11 was repeatedly harassed by @entity18 and others in ways that ' went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing '			1
@entity10 tackle @entity11 left the team over allegations of bullying the alleged bullying includes racial slurs , harassment and @entity18 allegedly forcing @entity11 to pay $ 15,000 for @entity10 players to take a trip to @entity101			1
@entity11 paid the money , but did not go on the trip			2
@entity18 , who has a history of drunken antics and on - field thuggery , claims he 's not a racist and that he and @entity75 actually are good friends			0
for @entity11 to win a lawsuit against the @entity10 , @entity109 law professor @entity108 said he 'd have to show that the harassment went above and beyond the norm in terms of locker room hazing			2
' it will be crucial for @entity11 to convince a jury that even with a rough workplace , there is a line that can not be crossed and it was crossed here , ' @entity108 said			2
one path for @entity11 to take would be filing a grievance with the @entity13 players union or a complaint with the @entity13 itself			1
aside from that , legal experts say there are several avenues he could take to sue the @entity10			0
@entity89 did not respond to an email asking for additional comment on any of these options			0
two labor - employment lawyers at @entity133 in @entity34 , @entity134 and @entity135 , said in a written analysis of the @entity11 matter that employers can face lawsuits related to bullying if the harassment involved a victim 's race , religion , sexual orientation or disability			2
@entity18 is accused of bullying his teammate @entity11 ' even if the @entity10 were unaware of @entity18 's alleged behavior , which may be the case , the organization could still face claims of liability , ' they said			2
there have also been reports that @entity18 was told by coaches to ' toughen up ' @entity11 , which could show the team did have knowledge about the harassment , the two lawyers said			2
still , it 's no slam dunk for @entity11			2
for @entity18 himself , the main issue would likely be his future @entity13 playing career			1
the @entity13 players ' union announced thursday that @entity18 has filed a grievance over his indefinite suspension by the @entity10			0
the union statement says that @entity18 is requesting an expedited hearing so he can resume playing football immediately			0
@entity171 , a law professor at the @entity172 , said the current national focus on bullying and hazing in schools and at the workplace would figure in @entity11 's favor should he take legal action			0
especially , she said , because he is a physically imposing @entity13 player — 6 - foot - 5 , 312 pounds — who is typically perceived as having few weaknesses			0
' the fact that you have a 300 - pound man who feels so threatened and uncomfortable that he leaves , that 's an indication of how serious it was , ' @entity171 said			0
from the criminal standpoint , former prosecutor @entity187 said it 's possible but not likely that @entity18 could be charged with extortion if he made threats to force @entity11 to pay the $ 15,000 for the vegas trip			0
another option would be written threats to do bodily harm , based on @entity18 's texts to @entity11 making threats about his mother			0
' however , i do n't really see the ( state prosecutors ) going after @entity18 , but i could be wrong , ' @entity187 said			0
@entity200 does have an anti-hazing law , but @entity108 said it applies only to educational institutions and not adult workplaces .			0

@entity11 says he looks ' forward to working through the process and resuming my career in the @entity13 '
@entity13 special investigator , @entity15 , met with @entity11 on friday , who is with his family in @entity77 and is receiving counseling
