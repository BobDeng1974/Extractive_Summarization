mother - of - two @entity9 was holidaying with a friend while @entity20 widow @entity13 , now 59 , was on aboard with his daughter when they got chatting at dinner			1
@entity9 says : ‘ i certainly was not looking for a relationship and neither was @entity13			1

love at first sight : the couple met on cruise in 2008			1

’ in fact the couple met up again in @entity102 just a few weeks later			2
‘ it just affirmed what we already knew , that we wanted to be a couple			0
but we already knew that our situation – both of us having children that needed us in different countries – meant living together was not an option so we went into it with our eyes open			2

her marriage ended after ten years and her children now aged 12 and 16 remained in the home with their father while @entity9 moved into a place nearby so she could still see them everyday			1

‘ yes there are times when it is hard , but it ’s no different for couples in the @entity205			0
you get used to it			0
