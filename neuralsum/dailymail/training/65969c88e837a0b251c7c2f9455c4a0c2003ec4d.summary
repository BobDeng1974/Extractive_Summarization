by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 19 july 2013 we may be baking in a heatwave but scientists have detected snow around a young solar system 175 light years from @entity6			1
@entity8 astronomers have snapped the first ever direct image of a snow line - the point where liquids turn to ice - around an infant solar system			1
the images show the region around the star where water , carbon dioxide , methane , carbon monoxide and other gases freeze onto dust particles orbiting around the young star at its centre			2
@entity8 astronomers have snapped the first image of a snow line ( pictured )			1
they saw the carbon monoxide snow line ( where the green meets the black inner ring ) that had formed around star @entity32			1
they believe it is similar to how our own solar system would have appeared when it was just a few million years old a snow line is the point where liquids turn to ice , in an infant solar system			1
on @entity6 , snow lines form at high elevations where falling temperatures turn atmospheric moisture to snow			0
the snow line region is believed to play an important role in the formation of planets			0
the frosting that covers the dust particles floating in it allows them to stick together , rather than obliterate each other should they collide			0
@entity59 has given us the first real picture of a snow line around a young star , which is extremely exciting because of what it tells us about the very early period in the history of our own @entity36 , scientists said the scientists used the @entity69 ( @entity59 ) telescope in @entity71 to take the images			1

the snow line region is believed to play an important role in the formation of planets , as the frosting that covers the dust particles floating in it allows them to stick together , rather than obliterate each other should they collide			0
an artist 's concept of a snow line around star @entity32 is pictured and shows ice - covered dust grains in the inner disc ( blue ) and carbon monoxide ice covered grains in the outer disc ( green )			1
the transition from blue to green marks the snow line dr @entity97 , an @entity8 researcher with the @entity98 , co-led the international team whose results are published in @entity101			2
he said : ' @entity59 has given us the first real picture of a snow line around a young star , which is extremely exciting because of what it tells us about the very early period in the history of our own solar system			1
' ' we can now see previously hidden details about the frozen outer reaches of another solar system , one that has much in common with our own when it was less than 10 million years old			2
' on @entity6 , snow lines form at high elevations where falling temperatures turn atmospheric moisture to snow			0
in much the same way , snow lines form around young stars in the distant , colder reaches of the disks from which solar systems form			0
the transition from blue to green marks the carbon monoxide snow line on this artist 's concept			2
the snow helps grains of dust to adhere to each other by providing a sticky coating , which is essential to the formation of planets and comets depending on the distance from the star , other more exotic molecules can freeze and turn to snow			0
the snow line spotted around @entity32 formed on the boundary between warm and cool regions of space where the young star 's heat energy is weakest			2
the presence of dust insulates an area of the gas which allows it to form ice crystals			0
however , further out from the disk of dust that will eventually go on to form planets , the gas heats up			0
this ' cocoon ' of hot gas had previously thwarted the scientist 's efforts to observe the snow lines , which were only discernible from their ' spectral signatures ' , or the radiation reflected off the particles and into space .			0
