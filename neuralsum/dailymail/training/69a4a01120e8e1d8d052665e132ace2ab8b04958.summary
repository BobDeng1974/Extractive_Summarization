by @entity0 last month it was my first wedding anniversary			1
just like any new wife , i made an extra-special effort to look good			1
i wore one of my favourite dresses , put on heels and carefully applied my make - up			1
then , standing back , i assessed my reflection in the mirror - and burst into tears			1
i should have been over the moon , heading out for a romantic evening with the man i loved			1
instead , i had a meeting with a very different man indeed - my divorce lawyer			1
nobody gets married thinking that one day they 'll have to sign divorce papers			1
i might have been nearing 40 when i walked down the aisle , with a four - year - old son from a previous relationship , but i still believed in happily ever after			1
swept off her feet : @entity26 agreed to marry @entity27 after they had been together seven momths to sign along that doomed dotted line less than a year later was devastating and humiliating			1
how could something go so wrong in such a short period of time ? i 'd first met @entity27 - a 46 - year - old carpenter - at my 39th birthday party in 2012 through his sister , who 's a friend of mine			1
i was a single mother to @entity37 , then three , and had successfully built a life for myself - i was n't looking for a man to complete me			1
i 'm not one of those women who feels they need a strong arm to hang on , and while it did get a little lonely on occasions , i did n't want to meet someone for the sake of it			1
i felt that any man would have to significantly enhance my and @entity37 's life for me to feel they were worth our time			1
and from the moment i met @entity27 , this is exactly what he did			1
there were no lightning bolts - he was n't even my type physically			1
yet i felt oddly drawn to him			1
it might be a cliché but i really did feel as if i 'd known him for years			2
after that first meeting , @entity27 persistently wooed me			1
he sent me roses and constantly texted and phoned			2
on our first date , he drove for miles just to take me to an @entity68 restaurant he thought i would like			2
i had n't experienced this kind of attentiveness for a long time i 'd be lying to say i did n't feel a flutter of excitement - but i was also wary of letting my guard down			2
i can remember , late one evening , his number showing up yet again on my mobile phone			2
i was so unused to a man pursuing me that i pulled the duvet over my head and refused to answer			2
i 'd been out of the dating loop for so long , i had no idea how to respond			2
but eventually i let him take me out for dinner			2
on our first date , he drove for miles just to take me to an @entity68 restaurant he thought i would like			2
i had n't experienced this kind of attentiveness for a long time			2
i was overwhelmed and for the first time in years i allowed myself to think that maybe i did n't need to be on my own after all			2
most of all , though , i wanted my son to have a father figure in his life and @entity27 made me hope this might be possible			1
to say he was brilliant with @entity37 , who has @entity96 's syndrome , would be an understatement			1
they took to each other instantly and with incredible ease			2
perfect father figure : @entity27 got on well with @entity37 , her son from a previous relationship sometimes @entity27 would come to our house in the evenings , and @entity37 would climb on to his lap and throw his arms around @entity27 's neck			1
seeing them together made me feel so content			2
then , a few weeks into our relationship , @entity27 carved a beautiful puppet theatre from wood for @entity37			1
looking back , this was the turning point			2
seeing @entity27 and my son together made me want to weep for @entity37 and what i 'd nearly deprived him of			1
perhaps if it had n't been for this i might have taken things more slowly , been more rational			2
when @entity27 proposed in september , seven months after we met , i did n't hesitate			1
he even remembered a ring i 'd fallen in love with in a magazine - an art - deco - style platinum band			2
most importantly , he said he wanted to give me and @entity37 the security we deserved			2
we married in february last year - a magical winter wedding in one of my favourite places in @entity131			2
i was marrying a man i loved , and he loved me and my son , too			1
i felt like i 'd hit the jackpot			2
i see things differently now			2
i see that i paid for the wedding and put in all of the work to make it happen			0
it was the start of a pattern			0
@entity27 did n't seem to be doing anything , or making any effort to make me happy @entity27 moved into my home in @entity144 , @entity131 , and - stupid as it might sound now - we agreed i would pay for the day - to - day bills			1
he would save his earnings from carpentry jobs to put towards the new house we were planning on buying together			0
this seemed a fair exchange			0
i had royalties coming in from my novels , and substantial savings			0
i did n't for a second imagine that @entity27 might not be putting away money as we 'd agreed			1
then , three months into our marriage , @entity27 dropped the bombshell that he had n't saved anything			1
he 'd lent the money to his father , he said			0
we had an almighty row - our first proper marital humdinger			0
i wanted to believe him			0
worse still , i needed to			0
we were in the early stages of marriage			0
i just could n't allow doubts to creep in			0
we soldiered on but , much as i wanted to ignore it , everything felt different			0
from the moment @entity27 moved in , it seemed to me that he stopped making an effort			1
i was doing more than my share : paying the bills , taking care of @entity37 and working on my latest novel to support us			0
@entity27 did n't seem to be doing anything , or making any effort to make me happy			1
i could cope with the fact our sex life had dropped off a cliff , but he also seemed to lose interest in @entity37 , who worshipped the ground he walked on			0
i sought solace in friends , who told me the first year of marriage is always the worst			0
deep down i knew it was something more than this			0
i was n't ready to face it yet , but an icy feeling of dread was starting to take hold			0
short - lived happiness : @entity26 did n't expect to celebrate her first wedding anniversary with a divorce lawyer six months after we married , @entity27 started to come home from work reeking of beer			1
he would plonk himself on the sofa and spend hours on his @entity202			0
there was little communication between us			0
when we did talk , it was usually a row			0
things unravelled with startling speed			0
it seemed to me that @entity27 had simply given up all pretence that he was the lovely man i 'd fallen in love with			1
the façade , as i now saw it , was falling daily			0
one night he came home drunk and staggering , and for the first time i was afraid of him			0
@entity216 , i told him he was disgusting and that i did n't want him anywhere near @entity37			0
he lashed back , saying : ' i did n’t marry @entity37 - i married you			0
' then he became aggressive and threw a pair of shoes across the room at me			0
it seemed , for the first time , that i was seeing his true colours			0
i should have thrown him out there and then , but it still felt too soon to admit i 'd made a terrible mistake			0
i was so ashamed that my marriage was failing so quickly			0
our marriage lasted just ten sorry months and left me with a string of frustrating , unanswered questions if i had n't so desperately wanted it to work , i may have reacted differently			1
but my parents had enjoyed a long and contented marriage before my father passed away , and i was still under the delusion that i could achieve the same happiness with @entity27			1
perhaps if we 'd had the backdrop of a deeper relationship , it might have worked			1
but when the honeymoon was over , there was nothing substantial to sustain us			0
my marriage was over - that much i knew			0
i could no longer deny a truth that was staring me in the face			0
i had absolutely no idea who my husband was			0
two weeks before @entity248 last year , @entity27 simply failed to come home			1
of course , i called the police because i had no clue where he was			0
they investigated and came back with the news that he 'd told them he was n't a missing person			0
he simply did n't want to be found by me			0
my instincts had been right but the reality was incredibly hard to @entity259 marriage lasted just ten sorry months and left me with a string of frustrating , unanswered questions			1
there 's no denying @entity27 was not the man i thought he was			1
but who is he ? i ca n't help but ask myself if he was only with me for a few months of rent - free living , or did he simply fall out of love with me ? maybe i was n't the woman he thought i was when we fell in love			1
i 'll probably never know			0
indeed , i have n't seen or spoken to @entity27 since the day he left , and all i want now is for him to agree to a divorce and cut me free , so we can put the whole sorry saga behind us			1
for the past 12 months i 've been living a lie , desperately trying to complete a jigsaw with a missing piece that wo n't fit			1
and the worst of it is , i 've put @entity37 through it all in the hope of making his life better , when all i 've done is make it worse			0
but i 've learnt my lesson			0
if something seems too good to be true then , most of the time , it probably is			0
some names have been changed .			0
