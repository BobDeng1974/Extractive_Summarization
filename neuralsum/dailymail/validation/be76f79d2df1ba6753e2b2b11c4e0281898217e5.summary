@entity1 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter @entity7			1
the controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight			1
writing in her column for now ! magazine , the 39 - year - old said : ' the most upsetting thing of all is a fat child			1
' watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle			1
' the mother - of - three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems : ' i 've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent			1
' the fat kids go through the school gates and there 's the fat mum in the car , who does n't bother to get out , still wearing her pyjamas ... and that really does my head in			1
' citing government statistics that say one - in - 10 four - year - olds are now overweight , the @entity43 star even goes as far to say that , if she had her way , fat children would be ' sent to special sports schools until they make the grade			1
' @entity7 also opines that she thinks people in @entity52 are far too soft on ' fat shaming '			1
' there 's loads of fat kids and we do n't say anything because that would be fat - shaming , or bullying ... well , i disagree completely			1
' in @entity52 , we 're far too soft on it and we seem to think it 's okay that people are pureeing @entity63 to spoon - feed to their babies			1
' earlier this year , the opinionated former @entity66 star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight			1
@entity1 has form with insulting overweight people			1
on her television show making my fat , she was kicked out of an 800lb woman 's house after rows			1
now , she 's turned her venom to children , saying obese kids should go to ' special sports schools ' until they make the grade ' @entity1 before her own weight gain ( left ) and after ( right ) in the programme , @entity1 was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape , but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight			1
she loaded up on junk food every couple of hours , setting herself a target of 5,000 calories every day			0
@entity1 's doctor advised her not to go through with the programme , warning the star that she faced a number of health problems including liver strain , damaged knees , altered blood chemistry , and stretched skin among other issues			0
but she persisted with the experiment , going so far as to travel to @entity108 in the @entity109 to take part in an eating competition			0
@entity1 reveals she had to sleep next to a sick bucket because overeating made her feel so nauseous at the fast food restaurant , customers are given 20 minutes to consume a monster burger , containing a kilo of meat and 8,000 calories			0
@entity1 gave the meal her best shot , but only succeeded in consuming around half			0
she said : ' there are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds ( 14.2 stone ) and 300 pounds ( 21 stone ) each			1
' i ca n't understand why no one is telling them to stop			0
' i feel really sorry for those children			1
their parents were just there watching them eat			0
' i just want to go and ask them to stop			0
' i could n't do that to my children			2
i could never feed my children to death			2
' @entity1 also visited an @entity109 called @entity139 , a woman who weighs 803lb ( 57 stone )			2
@entity139 is often confined to her house because of the weight that she carries around			0
while the women initially got on like a house on fire , @entity1 quickly insulted @entity139 and the women became embroiled in an argument , which saw her asked to leave the house			0
the tv star was unrepentant , telling the cameras : ' there is no way she is really happy			2
' she has managed to become happy with what she has got by accepting it 's rubbish			0
' i would rather be put down than be @entity139			2
' making my @entity157 followed @entity7 as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day , then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise the end of the programme saw @entity1 engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight , gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours			1
@entity7 strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the @entity171 - she recently came second in a poll of the world 's most hated people			1
the television star 's documentary made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her			0
she told @entity180 : ' fat people can be quite afraid of me , there is this sort of @entity185 fear			1
' a lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street			0
@entity1 said she wanted her @entity192 documentary to start a debate about the nation 's obesity crisis ' others will present me with their excuses before i have even opened my mouth , which is weird because it 's not like i go around judging me all of the time			0
' fat mums completely avoid me , but that ’s fine			2
' @entity1 has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years			2
last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she would n't hire a fat person because they are ' lazy '			1
so in the last six months , the 39 - year - old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly , to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds			1
the star has very little time for larger people , admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat , but she has even less for their excuses			1
instead of laying the blame for @entity171 's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies , @entity1 says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do			0
@entity1 said : ' at my heaviest during this television experiment , i weighed 12 stone			2
' nowadays , i hear a lot of women say 12st is n’t that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14			1
' but it 's strange idea that we think 12st is n’t that big , i actually find it very alarming			0
' we keep pushing up the boundaries , first of all 10st was n't that big , then 11st and now 12st			0
' i really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation			0
' by putting size 16 models in @entity252 shop windows and embracing bigger seats , bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal			2
' the controversial figure claims that while she did n't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children , gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st ' killed her ' and left her in constant floods but while @entity1 thinks the plus - size models in @entity252 shop windows are unacceptable , the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in @entity268 are acceptable in her eyes			1
she said : ' i do n’t mind skinny mannequins			0
' i did n’t think that they were particularly skinny , i thought that they looked pretty alright			0
' there are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny			0
i was a pretty skinny kid			0
' in terms of sizing , @entity278 starts their plus - size collection at a size 12 and i ’ve always said that size 12 is a size called fat			1
' because for me , it ’s not necessarily that a size 12 is fat , it ’s so that people can have a sense of what is normal			1
' i believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger , we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal			0
' in part two of @entity1 's documentary she debated diet bloggers and plus - size campaigners @entity1 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot			2
asked about a fat tax as a potential solution , making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce , @entity1 scoffs and suggests a far more radical option			1
she says : ' i ’m not averse to the idea of a fat tax , but i would go much more brutal than that			2
' i think the fact that we do n’t own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have			0
' for instance , our nhs in this country is free at point of use , but most people perceive that as completely free			2
' therefore , any problem that they create with their body is also free , with someone else footing the bill			0
' she continued : ' obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like £ 17.4 billion last year			1
' we need to make these people own the problem			2
so , we should have a social security insurance scheme , whereby people are charged if they do n’t make a genuine effort to look after their own health			2
' if you do n’t look after your own health , guess what ? you ’re going to pay more			0
so if you smoke , guess what ? you ’re going to pay more			0
you drink too much , guess what ? you ’re going to pay more			0
' and if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese , then you ’re going to pay for your hip operation as well			0
' that would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax			1
' because this tea and sympathy lark just is n't working			0

the 39 - year - old says people in @entity52 are too soft on ' fat - shaming '
