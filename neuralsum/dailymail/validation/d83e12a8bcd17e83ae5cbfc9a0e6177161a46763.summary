the so - called ‘ health tourism gap ’ between the amount the @entity3 collects from @entity5 patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from @entity0 has soared to almost £ 700million hospitals ’ failure to claw back the cost of treating @entity13 is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week , figures suggest			1
the so - called ‘ health tourism gap ’ between the amount the @entity3 collects from @entity5 patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from @entity0 has soared to almost £ 700million			1
it means the @entity0 is now paying out £ 15 for the healthcare costs of @entity0 who fall ill abroad for every £ 1 it gets back for the @entity3 treatment of @entity13 visitors			1
the prime minister and health secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £ 500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18			1
both gps and hospitals will be given incentives to identify @entity30 users of the @entity3 and payment procedures will be made easier			2
however , the latest @entity33 statistics indicate there is a long way to go			0
released following a @entity38 request , they show that in 2013/14 , @entity0 taxpayers handed £ 749.8million to @entity13 governments to pay for the care of @entity0 citizens abroad			1
this has risen by £ 100million from £ 649.3million just a year before			2
but in the same period , the @entity3 managed to collect only £ 50.3million from @entity13 countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here			1
this is an increase on the £ 32million total the year before – but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way			2
ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment			2
figures which emerged at the weekend show the @entity3 is still chasing at least £ 62million of unpaid bills for foreigners ’ care			1
one @entity65 hospital trust alone – @entity66 – is owed almost £ 18million from overseas patients			0
one single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than £ 420,000			0
others owe more than £ 100,000 for treatments including dialysis , bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy , according to @entity76			0
health minister @entity77 was even photographed with a new mother from @entity79 who is still being pursued for a £ 3,000 bill			2
two years ago , cancer specialist professor j @entity81 warned many foreigners were travelling to @entity0 for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying			1
he said the @entity3 was also becoming the ‘ world ’s maternity wing ’			2
last night @entity86 , @entity87 mp for @entity88 , said : ‘ we ’re fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world			0
‘ but we are not the @entity94 , it ’s the @entity96			0
this is an issue which needs to be addressed			0
’ @entity99 health spokesman @entity98 said : ‘ it is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for @entity5 citizens			2
’ prime minister @entity107 , left , and health secretary @entity108 , right , have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £ 500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 part of the gap is due to the fact that so many @entity0 pensioners retire to the continent			1
there may also be more tourists from @entity0 travelling to mainland @entity13 than the other way round			1
but there are more than a million migrant workers from the @entity5 here , against far fewer @entity0 employed in other @entity13 countries			1
under @entity5 arrangements , @entity0 citizens can be treated by other nations ’ health services and the bill is sent back to @entity0			1
in theory , these @entity13 nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the @entity3			1
in 2013/14 , the @entity0 paid @entity131 £ 246million for treating @entity0 who fell ill there			1
only £ 22million came back the other way			2
some £ 250million was paid to @entity133 but only £ 3.2million came back			0
@entity134 received £ 152million but returned just £ 7million			0
@entity135 got £ 6.2million and sent back £ 1.1million , while @entity136 collected £ 8.9million and returned £ 400,000			0
a @entity33 spokesman said : ‘ we want international visitors to feel welcome to use the @entity3 , provided they pay for it – just as families in the @entity0 do through their taxes			1
‘ our plans will help recoup up to £ 500million a year by 2017/18			2
’ @entity145 , chief executive at the @entity146 ’ @entity147 , said : ‘ emergency medical treatment is one thing , but taxpayers can not be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer - term treatment for tourists			0
‘ our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors			1
' @entity79 - born @entity157 , who is being chased for £ 3,000 by the @entity3 after giving birth in a @entity160 hospital , meets with health minister @entity77 smiling alongside a health minister at a @entity160 maternity unit in 2013 , this new mum is still being chased for the £ 3,000 it cost the @entity3 to help her give birth			1
@entity79 - born @entity167 ’s unpaid bill is part of the £ 62million cost of ‘ health tourism ’ to @entity0			1
the 34 - year - old , an advertising executive in @entity172 , was pictured with health minister @entity77 on his visit to the @entity160 and @entity175 when the maternity suite was reopened			0
the mum said she complained to mr @entity77 about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it			0
but mr @entity77 has reportedly said he does not remember being told that			0
miss @entity167 , now in @entity181 , told the @entity76 it was ‘ unfair ’ she was still being pursued , because the baby ’s father is @entity0			0
she said : ‘ i know the system may believe i travelled to abuse the @entity3 benefits , but ... i just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that ? ’ the couple were questioned about the birth when they entered @entity0 at @entity193 in october 2013			2
however , they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it			0
miss @entity167 said : ‘ i was told because i was 31 weeks ’ pregnant it was likely i was going to use the @entity3 to my advantage			0
we said we would pay for the birth			0
but we had no idea how much we ’d be charged			0
