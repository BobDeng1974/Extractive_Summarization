@entity1 scientists believe that one of @entity4 's moons is the most likely place in the universe beyond the @entity7 that could harbour life			0
@entity9 , the sixth closest moon to the planet , is far more likely to be habitable than desert - covered @entity12 which has been the focus of recent @entity15 exploration , they say			1
it 's ocean , thin shelf of ice and the presence of oxidants on @entity9 make it far more likely to be home to a life form than the red planet			1
habitable ? scientists believe that there could be life on @entity28 , pictured , a moon of @entity4			2
now @entity1 has set aside Â£ 14.6 million ( $ 25 million ) to design probes that could find out if life could thrive on the moon now @entity1 says it has revised plans to explore @entity9 , coming up with a cheaper way of completing its mission			1
@entity36 , a planetary scientist at @entity1 's @entity37 ( @entity37 ) in @entity38 , @entity39 , told @entity40 24 : ' @entity9 is the most promising in terms of habitability			2
' it is the place we should be exploring now that we have a concept mission we think is the right one to get there for an affordable cost			0
' speaking at the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) annual conference , mr @entity36 said that a new $ 2 billion exploration project called @entity53 would see @entity1 team up with physicists from the @entity56 in @entity57 if it gets the go ahead			0
probe : a close up picture of @entity9 's surface taken by the @entity61 probe in the 1990s promising : it 's ocean , thin shelf of ice and the presence of oxidants on @entity9 make it far more likely to be home to a life form than the desert covered plains of the red planet , say scientists the mission follows the success of @entity76 , a probe that closely explored @entity78 - a moon of @entity80			1
@entity1 will send a spacecraft into @entity4 's orbit and conduct a number of close flybys of @entity9			2
mr @entity85 says that exploring @entity9 using the flyby method will allow scientists to explore the moon in its entirety			1
@entity53 could be launched by 2021 and would take a further three to six years to reach @entity9			2
but @entity1 announced late last year that there are currently no funds for the mission			0
frozen : a system of ridges and cracks on the icy surface of @entity4 's @entity9 is shown in this @entity1 photo released in 1998 in orbit : @entity9 is one of @entity4 's four @entity102 moons instead , it will send a new robot to @entity12 in 2020 , similar to @entity104 , the craft which has been exploring the surface of the planet since last august , at a cost of around $ 2.5 billion			1
the probe @entity109 is to arrive in the orbit of @entity4 in 2016 , but after it is crashed a year later , the @entity15 will have no probe 's in the outlying reachers of the solar system			0
it could however , team up with the @entity115 which plans to launch a mission to @entity4 in 2030			0
@entity9 was first examined by the @entity118 mission in 1979 and by @entity61 in the 1990s			1
as well as @entity9 , scientists believe that @entity120 , a moon belonging to @entity80 , could also be habitable			1
fresh focus : @entity12 has been the focus of @entity15 searches for life on other planets in recent years			0
shown is a picture sent back to @entity1 by the @entity104 , which has been examining the red planet since august 2012 @entity9 has very few craters on its surface @entity9 is the sixth closest moon to @entity4 and the smallest of the four @entity102 satellites that belong to the planet			1
it was discovered by @entity61 in january 1610 and is named after a @entity136 noblewoman in @entity138 mythology who was courted by @entity139 and became the queen of @entity141			1
@entity9 orbits @entity4 in around three - and - a - half days with an orbital radius of 670,900km			2
it is slightly smaller than the @entity7 's moon , but at 3,100km in diameter it is the sixth largest moon and 15th largest object in the entire solar system			0
it is likely to have an outer layer of water , some 100km thick			0
the outer layer of the water is believed to be frozen with a liquid ocean underneath			0
it is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface , which is tectonically active and relatively young .			0

@entity9 is the sixth closest moon to the *faraway* planet
scientists say that it has an ocean and a thin shelf of ice
it was discovered by @entity61 in january 1610
