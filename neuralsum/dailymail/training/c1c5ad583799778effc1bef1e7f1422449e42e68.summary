a jab of gel may be a new way to treat heart failure , a condition that affects 900,000 people in @entity6			1
the substance is injected into the heart wall to improve the organ ’s function and reduce symptoms such as breathlessness and swelling in the ankles			0
heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons , including cardiovascular disease , high blood pressure and heart attack			2
heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons , including cardiovascular disease , high blood pressure and heart attack as a result , the heart is no longer able to pump blood around the body properly			2
to try to increase its pumping power , the heart grows in size			0
this works for a while , but eventually the over-worked heart wall starts to stretch , becoming thinner and stiffer			0
the heart develops an abnormal shape and ends up pumping blood even less efficiently			0
the condition can also affect the heart ’s normal electrical signals , which can result in a dangerous heart rhythm disorder			0
there ’s no cure for heart failure , but lifestyle changes — such as cutting down on salt — and medication to reduce blood pressure can help keep symptoms under control			0
however , some patients do not respond to these			0
the hope is that the new gel injections will offer them an effective alternative			2
the treatment , called @entity65 , involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart ’s main pumping chamber , the left ventricle , where the disease tends to start			1
the jabs are given by a surgeon through an incision in the chest			1
the injections contain a gel - like material that thickens in the heart muscle , strengthening it and restoring its shape			1
this increases the heart ’s pumping efficiency and reduces stress on the organ , preventing further damage			0
the treatment , called @entity65 , involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart ’s main pumping chamber , the left ventricle , where the disease tends to start the gel does n’t harden completely , remaining pliant so it is flexible enough to move with the tissue of the heart wall			1
it is being trialled on 80 patients in 14 centres worldwide , including in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and the @entity100			1
early results show the jabs improve the heart ’s capacity and reduce symptoms			2
the @entity107 manufacturer @entity106 says : ‘ it represents a new treatment strategy based on the medically accepted principle that a reduction in muscle tension and cell stress will improve the function of the dilated left ventricle of the heart			1
’ dr @entity116 , consultant cardiologist at @entity118 teaching hospitals @entity117 , says : ‘ this ingenious technique of injecting a gel directly to the left ventricular muscle has a sound physiological basis			1
‘ hopefully , it will prove to be effective and safe in patients who otherwise may have a poor prognosis			0
