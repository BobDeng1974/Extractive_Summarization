by @entity0 disgraced @entity2 chief sir @entity1 wants to join a press regulator to defend the @entity4 against newspapers that ‘ hate ’ it			1
he was branded ‘ the man with no shame ’ after presiding over the @entity7 scandal , in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly			1
much of the appalling care at the hospital was uncovered by journalists and whistleblowers			0
resigned : sir @entity1 wants to join a press regulator to defend the @entity4 having resigned , he hopes to work with a new press regulator to prevent so - called sensational stories undermining the @entity2			1
the news was met with incredulity by one campaigner who helped expose the scandal			2
@entity22 , who set up the @entity23 after her mother died following horrific care at the hospital , said : ‘ this is exactly the job he should not be going for – so he can silence newspapers , silence whistleblowers and complainants			2
’ she hit the headlines after pressurising politicians to hold a public inquiry into @entity7 , which led to an announcement that the hospital trust would be dissolved			2
she added : ‘ if it had not been for newspapers and journalists exposing him , he would have continued to live in the long grass , reaping harm on the workforce and patients			2
former @entity2 ceo sir @entity1 has been branded ' the man with no shame ' by his detractors due to the number of stories that arose during the time of his leadership ‘ we want the @entity54 to be able to speak out about behaviour like this , performed while he has been in office			1
he should have nothing to do with the public and the public sector again			0
’ sir @entity1 , who had to retire early from his £ 211,000 post as @entity2 chief executive , leaves next month on a £ 110,000 - a - year pension			1
he has been accused of presiding over a @entity66 culture in which staff were afraid to speak out about poor care			0
as head of @entity72 from 2005 to 2006 – the body supervising @entity70 , he failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care there			0
elderly patients became so thirsty they drank dirty water from vases , while nurses left wards in tears because care was so poor			0
when a report revealed that hundreds of patients may have died needlessly , sir @entity1 insisted he was not ashamed of his record – comments that led to him being called ‘ the man with no shame ’			1
whistleblowers who contacted the former communist were paid off and made to sign gagging clauses			0
the government ’s @entity92 on press regulation was drawn up by politicians and approved by the @entity96 in the wake of the @entity98 into alleged wrongdoing by journalists			0
it underpins with statute a body to oversee regulation , with publications that refuse to comply facing exemplary damages in libel cases			0
newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up over fears that it would bring an end to 300 years of press freedom			0
instead , the @entity54 is establishing an independent body called the @entity115 , able to impose fines of up to £ 1million for systemic wrongdoing			0
sir @entity1 claims to want to become a ‘ non-executive director of the proposed press regulator ’ but did not specify which			1
he said he did not intend to prevent criticism of individuals in the @entity2 or to ‘ stop the @entity128 doing whatever it does ’ , but to protect confidence in it as it strives to publish figures tracking quality of care			1
he said a regulator would have an important role as the @entity2 tries to be more open about failings , adding : ‘ we ’ve got to have a media and a context which is supportive of that			1
’ otherwise , he said , coverage could result in staff being ‘ frightened or hiding things ’ which would be ‘ really dangerous ’			2
‘ my real worry is ... we get attacked and what gets undermined is the principle of public services [ and ] public confidence			0
’ asked if he thought newspaper coverage of @entity7 was motivated partly by a desire to attack the public sector , sir @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s no accident is it that the people who led it hate the @entity2 ? ’			1
