@entity1 's chief executive has bowed to a landmark ' right to be forgotten ' ruling and has today introduced a new form letting people apply to get themselves removed from search results			1
the changes come after the @entity7 ruled people have the ' right to be forgotten ' - meaning @entity1 searches linked to individuals can taken down if they tarnish their reputation			1
but in his first interview since the decision , company co-founder @entity12 suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the changes as a green light to internet censorship			2
co-founder and ceo @entity12 has warned that a @entity22 court ruling on ' the right to be forgotten ' will help corrupt governments around the world in an interview with the @entity27 , he said : ' it will be used by other governments that are n't as forward and progressive as @entity22 to do bad things			1
' other people are going to pile on , probably ... for reasons most @entity22 would find negative			2
' he also told of his fears that the ruling , seen as the biggest ever privacy setback for an online company , would discourage would - be internet entrepreneurs from setting up new businesses			0
@entity1 is launching the online form today to allow people to have links to information taken down from the website 's search results			1
the company will review the deluge of requests it is expected to receive , with some links expected to be taken down within weeks			0
from today , @entity1 's website will contain a form for users who want links to information about them removed the ruling has been criticised after it emerged many of the 3,000 - plus requests the company has already received were from corrupt public figures and criminals desperate to hide their past			1
@entity1 says it wants to strike a balance between people 's right to privacy and maintaining links to information that is in the public interest			1
a company spokesman said : ' in implementing this decision , we will assess each individual request and attempt to balance the privacy rights of the individual with the public 's right to know and distribute information			1
' people who want links about them taken down from @entity1 will have to give the company the url or web address of the offending webpage , their home country and an explanation of why they think the link should be removed			1
@entity1 insists ' humans , not algorithms ' will make the decision after looking into the applicant 's case			0
the plans only extend to local or national sites , e.g. @entity90 , and searches in @entity90 will still show the person 's undesired results			0
cases where @entity1 does not agree with the applicant will be passed on to national data protection agencies			0
searchers will then be notified if a link has been removed , although the original webpage will remain online			0
mr @entity12 said the powerful and famous will still be scrutinised online , adding : ' i 'm a public figure			1
there are lots of things that are written about me that i 'm sure are untrue			0
i kind of deal with that			0
' the original information about people will not be removed from the internet and will still exist on the relevant website , but web users will not see it in their @entity1 searches or be able to link to it through the site			2
cases which @entity1 refuses to act upon will be handed over to national data protection agencies , such as @entity118 's @entity117 , which are braced for a flood of requests in coming months			2
@entity121 , whose citizens have contributed 40 per cent of the requests to @entity1 so far , is even considering bringing in a new division of courts to hear internet privacy disputes			2
concerns have been raised that the ruling could lead to censorship after it emerged that an actor who had an affair with a teenager , a celebrity 's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests received			0
around 30 per cent of the requests @entity1 has been sent so far concern fraud , 12 per are related to paedophilia and 20 per cent concern reports of people 's arrests or convictions			0
the original case regarding the right to be forgotten was brought by a @entity150 man who claimed his privacy had been infringed by an auction notice for his repossessed home			0
under @entity156 17 of the @entity157 , internet users who are mentioned in data have the right to ' obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data '			0
@entity165 which also operates a search engine in @entity22 , has previously said it is ' carefully reviewing ' the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users			1
@entity171 , which operates the @entity173 search engine , has previously declined to comment on the ruling .			1
