many contain high levels of sugar and some are promoted for use from four months of age - a time when babies should still be on a diet of breast or formula milk			1
babies would need to eat twice as much shop - bought food to get the same energy and protein as meals cooked at home , researchers found			1
the study , from the department of human nutrition at the @entity35 , said many weaning foods ' would not serve the intended purpose ' of giving a baby extra nutrients or a range of tastes and textures			1
current guidelines encourage weaning from six months of age , with babies fed only breast or formula milk before this time			2
but some parents choose to wean early and baby foods are often marked as ' suitable from four months '			1
experts analysed all the baby foods produced by the main @entity53 manufacturers			2
these were @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity13 , boots , @entity57 , @entity14 and @entity58			2
products included ready - made soft foods and dry foods such as cereal that could be made up with milk or water , biscuits , rusks , bars , snacks and cakes			1
nutritional information for each product , such as calories , fat , iron and calcium , were collected from manufacturers ’ websites , the products themselves and from email enquiries			0
of the 479 items , 79 per cent were ready - made spoonable foods and 44 per cent were aimed at infants from four months			1
some 65 per cent of the products were sweet foods			1
of the 479 items surveyed , 79 per cent were ready - made spoonable foods and 44 per cent were aimed at infants from four months			2
some 65 per cent of the products were sweet foods the researchers said the typical calorie content of the spoonable foods was 282 kj per 100g , which is almost identical to breast milk at 283 kj per 100g of formula			1
but purees and spoonable foods made at home were ' more nutrient dense ' than the shop - bought foods			1
examples of homemade foods included chicken stew , beef with mash , stewed apple with custard and apple with rice pudding			0
and while commercial finger foods contained more calories , they had a ' very high ' sugar content			0
the iron content of most of the foods was also lower than that found in formula			0
writing in the journal @entity116 , the researchers said : the @entity53 infant food market mainly supplies sweet , soft , spoonable foods targeted from age four months			2
' most products are ready - made spoonable foods that are no more energy dense than formula milk , and are generally much less nutrient dense than homemade foods			1
' this meant that around 50g of a soft spoonable family food might supply the same amount of energy and protein as 100g of ready - made spoonable food			2
' the @entity133 recommends a gradual transition to solids starting with cereals , vegetables and fruits , before moving on to proteins			0
it recommends babies still continue to receive breast milk or a pint of formula a day while they are being weaned , up to their first birthday			0
the experts said many shop - bought foods are sweet , possibly to cater for babies ’ inherent preference for sweet foods			1
purees and spoonable foods made at home were ' more nutrient dense ' than the shop - bought foods			1
examples of homemade foods included chicken stew , beef with mash , stewed apple with custard and apple with rice pudding ' however , repeated exposure to foods during infancy promotes acceptance and preferences			0
' while shop - bought foods use fruit sugars to sweeten foods rather than added sugars , both probably contribute to tooth decay in equal measure , the experts added			1
a statement from @entity13 said : ' generations of parents have trusted @entity13 baby foods as safe and nourishing and which are specially prepared to meet babies nutritional needs with recipes that provide the right tastes and textures			1
' a statement from @entity58 said it did not add vitamins and minerals to foods due to organic production rules			0
' an exception to these rules is where there are general food industry laws and regulations that supersede any organic rules			0
' for example , @entity198 or @entity198 is required by law to be added to any weaning foods that are cereal based , to provide enough of this important vitamin for infants			0
' this plays a vital role in the development of a healthy nervous system and is needed for energy release , digestion and growth			0
' nobody was available for comment from @entity57			0
@entity214 , a spokeswoman for @entity12 and @entity55 , said : ' our foods offer good quality nutrition tailored to meet babies ’ needs and must comply with strict legal standards			2
the @entity133 recommends a gradual transition to solids starting with cereals , vegetables and fruits , before moving on to proteins			0
it recommends babies still continue to receive breast milk or a pint of formula a day while they are being weaned , up to their first birthday ' we recommend that our baby foods are used as part of a mixed diet which includes homemade foods plus breast milk or formula , which remains the most important source of nutrition for infants under 12 months			1
' the latest @entity242 data shows that most babies in the @entity53 are getting the nutrients they need from their weaning diets and that there are no significant shortfalls			0
' @entity248 , senior policy adviser at the @entity249 ( @entity249 ) , said : ' manufacturers have been dragging their feet , lagging behind current thinking and research evidence that babies do n’t generally need solid foods before about six months			0
' it ’s time they stopped labelling foods ‘ from 4 months			0
if babies are spoon - fed pureed fruit and vegetables before this time , it can replace the nutrients from milk			0
' many parents do find jars of food convenient when they are out and about , but babies can eat family foods most of the time			2
' buying commercial baby foods is also much more expensive than using family foods			2
