@entity0 horrified the nation when he was convicted 10 years ago for murdering his 8 - months - pregnant wife @entity2 and their unborn son @entity3			1
while he was sentenced to death for the crime , the likelihood that the 42 - year - old will actually be executed is unlikely in @entity9 where the last death row inmate was killed in 2006			1
perhaps most shocking though is the fact that @entity0 lives a relatively ' cushy ' life at the @entity15 's 163 - year - old @entity14 - which houses the largest death row population in the nation			1
above , photos of the man who killed his 8 - months - pregnant wife in jail last year getting the best of a bad situation : @entity0 allegedly lives in a single cell			1
above , a general view of the 163 - year - old @entity14 , which houses the largest death row population of any prison in the country roof top : the portion of the prison where @entity0 lives includes a roof deck with a half - basketball court recreation : above , a handful of @entity14 prisoners playing pick - up basketball on a roof - deck court @entity45 spoke with @entity46 , author of ' @entity47 : five men in @entity49 ' , who is one of the few outsiders who have been able to witness @entity0 's life behind bars			1
@entity46 says @entity0 is living in an ' exclusive ' part of the historic prison , in a single cell with the ability to socialize with other prisoners on a roof deck with a half basketball court			1
' i saw this quite , i would have to say , buff - looking young man with his shirt off , ' @entity46 said			2
' and he was playing basketball			0
he looked like you were watching some college athletes out on a neighborhood court play basketball			0
' ' you 've been around a lot of prisons , ' @entity45 ' @entity68 remarked			0
' it sounds to me like what you describe is the cushiest environment that you 've seen			0
' @entity46 went on to add that there are many death row prisoners in @entity9 who spend 23 of the 24 hours in a day locked in their cells			1
' they are not having the life @entity0 is having			2
@entity0 has an exclusive life inside @entity14 , ' @entity46 said			1
gruesome : @entity0 ( left ) was convicted in 2005 of murdering his wife @entity2 ( right ) when she was 8 - months - pregnant with their son @entity3 heartless : @entity2 's body and that of her unborn fetus washed up on the @entity91 shoreline a little more than three months after she went missing			2
above , @entity0 looking unconcerned in his mugshot and in court life in prison ? @entity0 was sentenced to death for the murder , but his execution looks unlikely in @entity9 where a death row inmate has n't been killed since 2006 @entity0 's comfortable accommodations add insult to @entity2 and @entity3 's deaths , since he has also shown no remorse for the crime			1
@entity2 was reported missing on december 24 , 2002			0
in the early days of the search , family and friends supported her husband @entity0 , believing he had nothing to do with her disappearance			0
but that changed when it was revealed less than a month later that @entity0 had been having extramarital affairs , and had even struck up a relationship with a massage therapist who did n't even know he was married			0
the fetus of the @entity0 's unborn child was found in april 2003 , after washing up on the shoreline of @entity91 north of the @entity119			0
the next day , a woman 's torso belonging to @entity2 was also recovered			0
prosecutors argued that the state the bodies were in indicated that @entity2 was suffocated or strangled to death			0
@entity0 was sentenced to death on march 16 , 2005 for the crime , with the judge calling the murder of @entity2 ' cruel , heartless and callous ' .			2
