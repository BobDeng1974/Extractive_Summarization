black boxes play a vital role in revealing what happened in the final moments of doomed flights , but not many people know what they actually look like			1
photographer @entity7 has shot a fascinating project documenting black boxes , shedding light on what happens to the devices after tragic crashes			1
despite the name , the boxes are usually red to help rescuers spot them among the wreckage of crashed planes and helicopters			1
after disaster strikes , there is an immediate attempt to cover the black box - as seen in recent tragedies such as @entity54 flight @entity52			1
the boxes , which record flight data and conversations between pilots , are incredibly important for discovering what led to a plane 's crash , as evidenced by the continuing search for @entity60 and its flight recorders in the @entity62			1
photographer mr @entity7 , from @entity64 , said the boxes were the only way to piece together the cause of a disaster			1
mr @entity7 's ( pictured ) work saw him gain access to air safety storage facilities where data recorders end up following an incident remarkable : the fascinating photographs document black boxes , and parts of boxes , that have been recovered from aircraft accidents mr @entity7 said he became interested in black boxes after being asked to take photographs of one after a helicopter crash in @entity81 , @entity82 after disaster strikes , there is an immediate attempt to cover the black box - as seen in recent tragedies such as @entity54 flight @entity88 black boxes have developed throughout the years , becoming stronger to ensure they survive even the most devastating impacts ' while everyone has heard of the black box , few people have seen one			1
these photographs document black boxes , and parts of boxes , that have been recovered from aircraft accidents , ' he said			1
' some of the earliest boxes used wire , metal foil , or continuous magnetic tape for recording			1
as technological instruments they are visually fascinating			2
' in addition , they are emotionally charged - some crushed , some burnt - they reveal stories of the tragedies that occurred			0
they may contain the last words of the pilots , and the best hope of understanding and preventing future mishaps			0
it is hard not to look at some of them without being reminded of our vulnerability			0
' mr @entity7 said he became interested in black boxes after being asked to take photographs of one after a helicopter crash in @entity81 , @entity82			1
he said : ' when i was shooting the one from the helicopter i noticed there were some others on shelves			2
many very old early models or just parts			0
they allowed me to photograph them			0
they did n't know what accidents many of the old ones were from			2
i just photographed them as objects			0
older models of black boxes relied on tape and magnetic wire , eventually progressing to tape following technological advances mr @entity7 carried out his research in @entity147 as the authorities in the @entity149 would not allow him to view wreckage there black boxes record flight data as well as conversations in the cockpit of planes , providing an insight into the final moments on board aircraft ' when back in the @entity149 i contacted our @entity159 ( tsb ) but they would not allow photographs			1
one day i read that the black box was invented in @entity147			2
so i ended up going to @entity164 and photographing what they had			0
' only a few of the boxes had tags and i did n't try to find out where they all came from and i 'm not sure they knew about the old ones			2
i think a few were not from crashes			2
' they told me that they often did the analysis for a large area around there , including @entity180			0
apparently many @entity181 return black boxes to the airlines			1
' there seem to be a few primary manufacturers			0
over the years they used magnetic wire and foil			0
and magnetic tape which fell into a slot in a box so it would n't get stuck on a reel			0
you can see that on one of the older boxes			0

fascinating photographs show black boxes *salvaged* from the wreckage of plane and helicopter crashes
@entity7 took the pictures to shed light on what happens to flight recorders after tragic accidents
many of them are dented , *mangled* and even damaged by fire but they could still be used by crash investigators
