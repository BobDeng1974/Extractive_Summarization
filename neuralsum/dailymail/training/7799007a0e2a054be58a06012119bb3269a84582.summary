by @entity1 reporter published : 13:16 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 14:23 est , 23 october 2012 short - haul air passengers who are delayed by more than three hours can expect to be compensated after airlines lost a legal fight in the @entity6 court			1
a number of airlines , including @entity9 and @entity10 , had challenged a 2009 ruling that passengers on flights to and from @entity6 should be compensated if they are delayed for more than three hours			1
today the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) in @entity15 confirmed the 2009 ruling after the airlines had challenged the @entity17 's @entity16 ( @entity18 ) over the matter			1
pay and delay : airlines will have to compensate delayed passengers after losing their legal challenge there will still be exceptional circumstances where compensation will not have to be paid , such as industrial action and extreme weather			1
but there are a number of compensation cases that have been put on hold since 2009 for which carriers might now have to pay out			0
passengers on flights starting or ending in the 27 - country @entity35 are entitled to between 250 euros ( £ 203 ) and 600 euros for delayed or cancelled flights under @entity35 rules			1
they also apply to any flight outside the @entity35 which takes place on an airline company based in the @entity35 today 's judgment was welcomed by the @entity18 which said the situation was now clearer for passengers			0
@entity18 regulatory policy director @entity45 said : ' every year around 200million passengers travel on two million flights to and from the @entity17 , with the vast majority experiencing no problems			2
' however , when something does go wrong , there are regulations in place to protect travellers , and the @entity18 is ready to ensure companies abide by them			0
' today 's judgment from the @entity58 offers much needed clarity for passengers , the airline industry and the @entity18 about when compensation must be paid following delays			0
' reaction : @entity10 said it was ' disappointed ' with the decision , while @entity9 noted it was ' aware ' of today 's ruling and will comply a @entity9 spokesman said : ' we are aware of the ruling and will continue to comply with the regulations			1
' travel company @entity71 , which was involved in the legal challenge , said : ' we note today 's ruling by the @entity14			1
' we are committed to treating our customers fairly and will continue to work with the @entity6 institutions to ensure that the underlying legislation is revised such that it strikes the right balance for passengers and airlines			2
' an @entity10 spokesman said : ' we are disappointed with the outcome but we are pleased we have final clarification and certainty on this issue			2
we will do everything we can to ensure our passengers do not have delays			0
our priority is to look after our passengers			0
' the @entity14 was ruling in a case involving @entity92 carrier @entity91 and another involving @entity93 , @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			1
in 2009 the @entity14 ruled that compensation should be payable by airlines at the same rates as for cancelled flights , but not if the delay was caused by ' extraordinary circumstances ' , in a case involving @entity102			2
at the time , it declared : ' there is no justification for treating passengers whose flight is delayed any differently when they reach their final destination three hours or more after the scheduled arrival time			2
' the ruling arose from a 2009 case involving @entity102			0
the @entity14 found that air travellers delayed for three or more hours should be compensated the same as those whose flights are cancelled in the @entity91 case , passengers sued the airline for compensation in a @entity92 court after a flight delay of more than 24 hours			1
judges subsequently sought advice from the @entity14			0
in the second case , @entity94 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity93 challenged the @entity17 @entity16 after it rejected their request to be exempted from paying for flight delays			1
@entity17 judges then asked the @entity14 in @entity15 for guidance			0
the compensation will also apply even if passengers are re-routed by the airline on another flight and still arrive three or more hours late			0
the ruling arose from cases referred from @entity92 and @entity134 courts in which passengers claimed compensation after facing delays - but not cancellations - which meant they arrived at their final destinations 25 and 22 hours after the scheduled time .			0

@entity14 confirms airlines must pay up
three year legal battle ends in *defeat* for @entity9 , @entity10 and others
