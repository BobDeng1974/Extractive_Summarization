it gives us a significant amount of hope			0
' questions about improprieties in the death inquiries , in which local law enforcement authorities investigated one of their own , have drawn national media attention			2
last year @entity72 and @entity73 covered the story			2
the @entity72 reported that at the scene ' though investigators collected the gun , clothing and other evidence , they never tested it for fingerprints , dna or gunshot residue			0
officers also failed to canvass neighbors ; failed to file required reports on what officers had seen that night ; failed to download mr. @entity37 ’s cellphone data or collect and test one of the shirts he wore that night and failed to isolate and photograph mr. @entity37 before he was interviewed			2
' during an investigation with the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , two women later said they heard @entity37 and @entity19 argue before she was killed , according to the newspaper			1
later , a crime scene re-constructionist with the @entity95 ' concluded that for the shells to end up where they had [ ... ] whoever pulled the trigger had to have been left - handed			0
unlike ms. @entity19 , mr. @entity37 is left - handed , ' the @entity72 said			1
the newspaper also contacted various experts , who disagreed with the assertions of one of the medical examiners brought in that @entity19 shot herself with the gun in an upside down position and its tactical light caused an injury on her face			1
@entity19 's friends and relatives have said that evidence such as a bruise , cut and a broken tooth suggest that she may not have killed herself , but was the victim of abuse			1
they stressed that she would never have left her young daughter , @entity119			0
@entity120 told @entity121 that @entity37 abused her sister on multiple occasions			2
' she was afraid of him , and @entity119 was afraid of him , ' she told the newspaper			0
speaking out : @entity30 is seen next to one of the @entity19 family attorneys , @entity125 , on friday ' there is no evidence and no truth that points to @entity37 as being responsible for @entity19 's death , ' said @entity132 ' @entity4 attorney , @entity131 , adding that a brother with whom she was close is supporting banks			1
others in the @entity19 family had petitioned @entity14 for the independent probe			1
their request moved forward as he faces a tight re-election campaign			0
the new investigation also follows heightened attention to domestic violence amid allegations of abuse by players in the @entity147			0
the attorney for @entity37 , who is suing a @entity95 investigator involved in the case , denied allegations of abuse in their relationship			1
a new witness recently emerged accusing @entity132 of inflammatory remarks the night after her death , said @entity131 , calling the allegation false			0
in an affidavit obtained by @entity158 , @entity156 claimed on sept. 3 , 2010 , ' [ @entity132 ] told me that all she ever did was put him down and make him feel bad about himself			0
he was going to be moving on with his life , and he was n’t going to let the [ expletive ] hold him back anymore			0
' ' it is part of the bigger picture of women who stay in relationships that are fraught with violence and abuse , ' said @entity169 , a @entity4 attorney for the family			1
' our belief is that @entity19 had told him that it was over and that she was ending this cycle , and that 's what precipitated this horrible ending , ' she said			2
domestic violence ? @entity120 has said @entity37 abused her sister on multiple occasions questions about improprieties in the death inquiries , in which local law enforcement authorities investigated one of their own , have drawn national media attention experts have disagreed with the assertions of a medical examiner that @entity19 shot herself with the gun in an upside down position and its tactical light caused an injury on her face sheriff @entity195 said in a statement ' since 2010 , many of you have become aware of the tragic death of @entity200			1
the more this case became controversial , the more we embraced the idea of having two experienced death investigators who are ' objective , ' ' expertly trained , ' with years of experience and who have not been subjected to the vagaries of social media , examine and review this case			0
on many occasions i have thought about asking for this but chose not to once i realized the utter unfairness it would be to @entity216			0
along that same line , i often wish some of us could walk for a bit in his shoes			0
we are confident that the new special prosecutor will reach the same conclusion that one law enforcement agency , two state attorney ’s including one who was assigned as a special prosecutor by the governor , and three medical examiners ; that the tragic death of @entity200 was the result of a self - inflicted gunshot wound			1
we certainly hope that the @entity200 family finds peace and acceptance in the findings of this new special prosecutor , something we have never been able to provide			0
' we must also remember that a year and a half ago i filed a very serious complaint with the @entity95 accusing two of their personnel with serious misconduct relating to this case			0
immediately after filing this complaint , one agent retired and the other was placed on paid leave where i believe he remains today			0
' additionally , state attorney @entity246 is currently investigating one of those agents ( @entity249 ) for ' @entity250 ' in regards to this case and his treatment of @entity254			0
' finally and very importantly , deputy banks and @entity19 ’s brother deputy @entity256 have both filed civil lawsuits against the @entity95 and their agents @entity260 and @entity249			2
it is truly ironic that the man that certain members of the @entity200 family have accused of being culpable in @entity19 ’s death is the one filing a civil lawsuit where one can not hide behind the @entity267			2

@entity4 governor @entity14 signed an executive order appointing a state prosecutor to investigate the death of @entity19
