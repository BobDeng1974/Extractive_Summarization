by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity2 has set his @entity4 team a 50 - goal target to fire them into the top 10 this season - and is scouring @entity6 for a striker to help them			1
@entity2 is expected to finish in to the top 10 this season but is confident , with their defensive record last campaign when they kept 14 clean sheet , if they can reach a half - century of goals they will make it			1
he has already brought in @entity19 for £ 12million but with @entity20 out for up to four months he is on the hunt for another hit - man and is looking abroad for the right player			1
if we can do the same as we did last season defensively then 50 goals will be enough for us			2
' we scored 40 last year and 46 the year before so if we hit the 50 - goal mark that will be enough to take us into the top 10 or better			2
' @entity2 admitted he has given up looking for a forward in @entity58 and is concentrating on the @entity6 market for a replacement for @entity20			1
he added : ' the price , wages , the type of player – all of those have been stumbling blocks when looking in this country			0
we are still waiting for another front - line player who could score a few goals			0
' that has been very difficult to acquire because of the injury to @entity20 but we are still pursuing that avenue as quickly as we possibly can			0

that player has to come here and be available to be used almost immediately			0
there may be a settling in period but it is looking more like that player is going to be from abroad rather than from this country			0
we are still searching high and wide			0
