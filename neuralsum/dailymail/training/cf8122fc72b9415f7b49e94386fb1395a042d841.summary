by @entity0 last updated at 8:45 am on 13th february 2012 when medical treatment fails , a mother ’s love and devotion can be just as powerful			2
when @entity5 and @entity6 were told by doctors in the @entity8 that they could n’t save their daughter @entity9 from a brain tumour they refused to give up hope			1
@entity9 , 34 , had been struck down by the rare tumour and the operation to try and reduce it caused her to have a massive stroke , and doctors said there was nothing more they could do			1
happy family : @entity9 , centre with her mother @entity21 , right , and her husband @entity22 with their sons @entity23 and @entity26			1
her parents paid £ 150,000 for pioneering treatment in the @entity29 to save their daughter 's life so the couple paid £ 150,000 for pioneering treatment in the @entity29 - as a last chance of hope to save their daughter ’s life			2
the treatment was successful , but it left @entity9 unable to have the family she desperately wanted			1
so the loving family stepped in once again - and funded the £ 25,000 cost of seven cycles of @entity44 treatment to give their daughter the two sons she had dreamed of			1
mrs @entity9 , who lives with her husband @entity22 , 38 , in @entity49 , @entity50 , said : ‘ i just ca n’t find the words to thank my mum and dad for what they have done for me			1
‘ they have never given up on me , and because of them i can have the life i ’ve always dreamed of			2
‘ i ’m still alive and i have the two most gorgeous sons			2
and its all thanks to mum and dad who have made it all happen for me			2
’ mrs @entity9 first started suffering from headaches in the summer of 2001 when she was working as a school pe teacher			1
she went to see her gp who referred her to the @entity69 in @entity70 who said there was nothing wrong			2
but she still kept suffering from blurred vision and headaches , so she went for a private @entity75 , which revealed that she had a brain tumour			0
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i was so shocked when i was diagnosed			1
all i could think of was it should n’t be happening , i was only 26			0
i had my whole life ahead of me			0
i was so frightened , i thought i was going to die			0
’ @entity9 having treatment for her tumour in @entity81 , @entity29			1
mrs @entity9 first started suffering from headaches in the summer of 2001 when she was working as a school pe teacher she underwent an operation at the @entity84 in @entity85 to remove part of the tumour , and then doctors decided to remove the rest of the tumour in a second operation in april 2004			1
but during the second operation , mrs @entity9 suffered a stroke that was so severe that she could n’t talk and was paralysed down her right side			1
because she had suffered the stroke during the operation , the surgeons had been unable to remove the rest of the tumour			0
it took mrs @entity9 five months before she could even get out of her wheelchair and take her first steps being helped by physiotherapists			1
doctors told her there was nothing more they could do for her , as they could n’t risk operating on her again			0
but her parents refused to give up			0
they spent hours on the internet and eventually found @entity105 in @entity81 , @entity29 , where doctors had found a way of shrinking tumours by bombarding them with radioactive proton particles			0
the pioneering treatment would cost £ 150,000 , but it could have left mrs @entity9 infertile			1
her parents sent her brain scans off to the clinic and they agreed to help			0
she said : ‘ i had always wanted a family so i did n’t want to be left infertile , but i knew this was the only chance to save me , and mum and dad never hesitated to step in and help			1
’ she went to the @entity29 in january 2005 and underwent the treatment which took eight weeks			2
it finished in march that year , and the treatment had managed to successfully halt the growth of the tumour			2
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i was just so relieved when the treatment was a success			1
it had given me my life back			0
it was my only chance of survival , and now i could look forward to living my life again			0
’ the treatment had left mrs @entity9 infertile , but again her family refused to give up hope as they knew how desperately their daughter wanted to be a mother			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i had always desperately wanted to have a family			1
i was so thrilled that i was still alive after the brain tumour and i was so grateful for that			0
but every time i saw a pregnant woman i just felt a huge longing to be a mum myself			0
’ the family funded the first @entity44 treatment for their daughter , and the first cycle was a success			1
she fell pregnant with their son @entity23 , now four			0
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ when i gave birth to him i stared at him for hours because i could n’t believe that he was actually mine			1
after everything that had happened i was finally a mum			0
’ the couple decided to try for another baby , but this time it took six attempts at fertility treatment before mrs @entity9 finally fell pregnant again			1
she gave birth to her second son @entity26 in august 2010			0
she said : ‘ we did n’t give up hope , and my family were behind us , supporting us all the way			0
when i fell pregnant again , we were all so thrilled			0
when @entity26 was born , it was as though my life was complete			0
‘ the doctors may have given up on me but my family never did , and its thanks to them that i ’m still alive			0
it has been a lot of money to save me and to pay for the @entity44 treatment , but my parents wanted to help me more than anything			1
’ mrs @entity9 is now concentrating on being a mum			2
she has to wear a special support called a @entity174 , from @entity175 , on her right leg , but she can walk and even drive using a specially adapted car			0
mrs @entity21 added : ‘ her brain tumour would have grown without treatment and nothing could have been done to save her			2
‘ we luckily had savings to make this possible for @entity9 , and it was worth every penny to save her and to see her be a mother			2
’ there is hope that proton therapy may become available in the next few years funded by the @entity188 .			0

treatment left @entity9 infertile and she needed 7 cycles of @entity44
