a couple bought a @entity1 for £ 10 at a car boot sale - and later realised it was worth £ 62,500			1
@entity3 and @entity4 were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in @entity8 , @entity9 , when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller 's stall			1
as a former collector , mr @entity4 , 22 , recognised the bear as a limited edition princess @entity17 - one of the most sought after in the collection which can be worth thousands of pounds			1
they are now selling it on @entity29 , with a starting bid of £ 20,000 but the builder was stunned to find out that the bear was one of just 100 made around the world - and that another version is currently listed on @entity29 for £ 62,500			1
the pair are now hoping to sell the bear on the auction site and put the money towards a deposit for a house			1
miss @entity3 , 20 , a beauty therapist who lives in @entity42 , @entity9 , said : ' we could n't believe it			1
we picked it up for £ 10 and it could be worth tens of thousands			2
' it 's so hard for young people to get on the property ladder so we think this could really be a blessing			0
' the pair had gone along to the car boot sale on bank holiday monday with mr @entity4 's parents where they sold some of his old toys , including @entity1			2
before putting the teddies in the pile , the couple looked online to check that none of the bears would count as collectors ' items			2
the pair , from @entity42 , @entity9 , are now hoping the sale of the bear will give them a deposit for a house while online , they read up about a princess diana @entity73 , which can sell for huge amounts			1
the range was created in december 1997 - the year the princess died - to raise money for the @entity26			1
it includes a poem on the tag which refers to @entity82 as an ' angel '			0
but even when he spotted the bear at another seller 's stall , mr @entity4 had no idea whether it was a ' first edition ' bear - which are incredibly rare - or a second edition , which sells for just £ 20			1
they later discovered the bear was handmade in @entity92 in december 2007 with special @entity94 pellets and wording on the tag , which refers to the @entity97 - all of which make it a first edition bear			2
there is also a poem which reads : ' like an angel she came from heaven above ; she shared her compassion , her pain , her love ; she only stayed with us long enough to teach the world to share , to give , to reach			0
' another first edition @entity82 bear , the same as the one belonging to miss @entity3 and mr @entity4 , is currently being listed on @entity29 for £ 62,500 miss @entity3 said : ' @entity4 and his sister used to collect @entity1 so before we sold a load we just wanted check that they were n't worth anything			1
' as we were looking , we saw that this purple bear was the rarest bear and it was going for around £ 20,000			1
we did n't think anything of it			0
' but when we went to the car boot sale the next day , @entity4 went off for a walk and came back clutching this bag			2
he said : " it 's that bear that we saw on the internet last night "			0
' the couple put it up for auction last night , with a starting bid of £ 20,000			1
a spokesman for @entity1 fan club @entity132 said only a handful of people know how many @entity136 were produced			0
the @entity1 were first introduced to the public in 1993 , when creators @entity138 , which later became @entity140 , launched its original line consisting of just nine characters			0
over the next few years however hundreds of different types of @entity1 were produced as they gained in popularity			0
the company made an empire worth more than $ 6billion from the toys , boosted by the increase in people buying them as popular collectibles in 1995			0
at the peak of the collecting craze , many believed the designs which had been ' retired ' would rise in value			0
the craze however failed to last much longer than 1999			0
nowadays hundreds of the cuddly toys are sold on sites such as @entity29 - but they are not always worth as much money as collectors would originally have hoped			2
however , there are some which have certainly increased in price , including the ' ultra rare ' @entity168 , first edition , which can be sold for tens of thousands of pounds .			0
