mr @entity0 claims that incomes from tolls on new roads , passengers on new railways and airport charges would help create returns of up to 8 per cent for pensioners all the pension schemes in the public sector should be merged into one giant pot to be invested in transport infrastructure , @entity0 has said			1
the 39,000 funds for public sector workers could be amalgamated to cut out ‘ extraordinary ’ waste from relying on thousands of pension managers , trustees and advisers , the mayor of @entity14 suggested			1
a single fund could be used to create a ‘ @entity26 ’ to boost the economy and improve roads , rail and airport links			0
mr @entity0 argued in the @entity27 that incomes from tolls on new roads , passengers on new railways and airport charges would help create returns of up to 8 per cent for pensioners who invested with them			2
he calculated local authority pension funds alone could hold assets of more than £ 180billion , while combining all public sector pensions would yield ‘ hundreds of billions ’			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ there are more than 39,000 public sector pension funds in this country – each with its own trustees , managers and advisers and accountants			1
‘ think of all those advisers and investment managers taking their fees – their little jaws wrapped blissfully around the giant polymammous udder of the state			0
‘ but it is worse than that – because this country is missing a huge opportunity , and one that is being exploited by more sensible governments around the world			0
’ mr @entity0 highlighted how huge public sector pension funds from @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 are already investing in new housing and infrastructure in @entity14 and elsewhere in @entity65			1
‘ we welcome that investment , of course			0
we are grateful , ’ he said			0
‘ but is it not absurd that we are not able to call upon @entity65 pension funds to perform the same function ? ’ he predicted pension fund managers would try to stand in the way of any change			2
a single fund could be used to create a ‘ @entity26 ’ to boost the economy and improve roads , rail and airport links , mr @entity0 said mr @entity0 said : ‘ the little pension funds will fight for their independence ; they will make all sorts of spurious arguments about the need for “ localism ” in managing this dosh , when of course the advice is all subcontracted to the same legion of investment managers , and when what they really care about is their fees and their tickets to @entity95 … and their golf - club bragging rights			1
‘ the vested interests must be ruthlessly overridden			0
it is time for @entity65 to have its own citizens ’ @entity100 , deploying our assets in a useful way , helping us to bolster pensioners and cut pointless public expenditure at the same time			2
’ mr @entity0 ’s plans go further than proposals already suggested by the government to move towards @entity110 - style collective pensions from 2016 .			0

@entity0 argues that income from tolls and tickets would help create returns
