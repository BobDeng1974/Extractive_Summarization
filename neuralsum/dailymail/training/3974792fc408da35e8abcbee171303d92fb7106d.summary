@entity6 was 25 when he was in a motorbike accident
left paralysed from the neck down and unable to breathe unaided
his parents could **n't** afford hospital fees so were forced to bring him home
use *makeshift* electrical device *overnight* but ca **n't** afford to run it all day
so family manually pump oxygen into his lungs by hand . if they stopped for three minutes he would die
