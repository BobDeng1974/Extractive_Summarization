off button : justice secretary @entity1 is planning an end to @entity4 's ' holiday camp jails ' , with plans including no @entity6 in cells , uniforms and less pocket money an end to @entity4 ’s ‘ holiday camp ’ jails , with a ban on @entity6 , fewer televisions , more prison uniforms , less pocket money for inmates and a ban on gay couples sharing cells is planned by the government			1
the return to ‘ spartan ’ jails marks the biggest prison regime shake - up for 60 years and is designed to signal a tough new approach to law and order by justice secretary @entity1			1
mr @entity1 believes prisoners do not deserve the kind of lifestyle and ‘ frills ’ that are beyond the reach of families on low wages			1
the move will provoke fierce opposition from prison reformers , but mr @entity1 says that making prison life tougher is a vital part of his war on crime			1
‘ i want prisons to be spartan , but humane , a place people do n’t have a particular desire to come back to , ’ he said in an interview with @entity45			0
in his new ‘ no - frills ’ prisons : and in a toughening - up of sentencing policies , mr @entity1 wants to stop people who carry knives for violent purposes from being let off with cautions			1
@entity56 : he said that he wanted prions to be ' spartan but humane ' and said he did n't want it to be a place people had a ' desire ' to come back to rape and violence should be prosecuted wherever possible , he says			0
speaking in his commons office , mr @entity1 , 50 , said : ‘ it is n’t reasonable for prisoners to enjoy things that those outside on low incomes would struggle to have			1
my idea of prison is not sitting watching the @entity71 sunday match			1
i accept that , given they are locked up for a long time , prisoners should have access to a tv set , but it is a privilege that should be earned , not given automatically			1
they should not get all the frills			0
‘ i do n’t approve of prisons buying state - of - the - art entertainment kit when most people have to make sacrifices to buy them			1
’ soft - spoken mp for leafy @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity1 is anything but brutal by nature			1
a former @entity89 business reporter and ex-member of the @entity91 , a forerunner of the @entity87 , he is not from the @entity92 ’ old - style hang ’ em and flog ’ em brigade			2
but his new ‘ spartan ’ jails policy is final proof that @entity98 ’s ‘ hug a hoodie ’ phase is well and truly over			2
he appointed @entity101 to succeed @entity103 veteran @entity102 after @entity104 complained @entity105 - wearing @entity102 ’s softly - softly stance on crime was losing votes			2
arguably , the harsher prison regime is the most significant change since hard labour and flogging were outlawed in @entity4 jails in 1948			1
change : he said that ' all aspects of prison life ' were being considered as part of the shakeup not that @entity1 intends to copy @entity120 prison chain gangs			1
‘ i would much rather someone was in a workshop learning a skill than breaking rocks to no purpose , ’ he tells me			0
the first change will be a ban on @entity71 and other subscription satellite tv			1
@entity1 chuckles as he recalls checking to make sure prisoners were not using it to watch pornography			1
‘ i asked , “ do they have access to @entity135 ? ” and no , they do n’t			0
’ in addition to being able to watch @entity6 , prisoners are allowed tvs in their cells in return for good behaviour			1
now , some prisoners face having them removed as the ‘ good behaviour ’ threshold is increased			2
similarly , the right to wear their own clothes and the right to buy treats in prison shops are likely to be restricted			1
‘ we are looking at in what circumstances should they have access to a tv set , wear their own clothes , things like that , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ prisoners get extra privileges and resources through good behaviour			2
we may tighten that regime			0
we are considering all aspects of prison life			0
’ and he is not prepared to tolerate the practice , said to be growing , whereby some gay inmates live as couples in cells , allowing them to have sex regularly			2
limit : @entity1 also wants governors to do more to stop prisoners getting hold of drugs and mobile phones , which give them access to @entity177 , allowing them to threaten those outside who have given evidence against them ‘ it is not acceptable to allow same - sex couples to effectively move in together and live a domestic life			1
if such a thing happened , i would want those prisoners put in separate prisons			2
’ @entity1 also wants governors to do more to stop prisoners getting hold of drugs and mobile phones , which give them access to @entity177 , allowing them to threaten those outside who have given evidence against them			1
‘ it has been a revelation to me the means people use to get these things into prisons , ’ he says			0
‘ a dead bird was thrown over a prison wall with drugs in and a prisoner came along and picked it up on the other side			0
’ @entity1 also wants to ban trouble - making prisoners from having jail terms automatically slashed			1
‘ i have a problem with the idea that someone who does not co-operate in prison gets early release			2
’ and he wants to cut the police use of cautions , seen as a ‘ let - off ’ by @entity103 critics			0
‘ i have serious misgivings about the number of people cautioned for carrying a knife – and i ’m not talking about someone on their way home after buying a @entity224 knife at @entity225			0
’ rapists and violent thugs should also be prosecuted wherever possible , he says			0
his disciplinarian views are mirrored by the ‘ regime ’ he and wife @entity230 adopted towards their two children , now 20 and 16			0
he says when they misbehaved they knew they could get a smack from dad			0
‘ you chastise children when they are bad , as my parents did me			0
i ’m not opposed to smacking			0
it is to be used occasionally			0
sometimes it sends a message – but i do n’t hanker for the days when children were severely beaten at school			0
’ since entering the @entity246 in 2001 , @entity1 has got into trouble more than once for his hardline views			2
learning : the mp said he would much prefer if prisoners were in a ' workshop learning a skill than breaking rocks to no purpose ' he was branded the @entity103 ‘ attack dog ’ for accusing @entity255 of making money from living at @entity257 and he was forced to apologise after rashly comparing @entity260 ’s @entity259 area to ‘ urban war ’ in the @entity120 tv crime drama @entity263			1
he was also branded ‘ bigot of the year ’ after saying @entity265 who ran bed - and - breakfast businesses should have the right to turn away homosexuals			0
the gaffe cost him dearly			0
when @entity98 became prime minister , @entity271 , not @entity1 , was made home secretary , and he had to settle for being a lowly number - cruncher for @entity274 at @entity275			1
he won @entity277 promotion last year after mr @entity98 finally lost patience with mr @entity102 as justice secretary and lord chancellor and gave the job to @entity1			2
he says his main aim is to stop the vicious circle in which no sooner have prisoners been released than they commit another crime and go back inside			0
@entity56 jails and humane rehabilitation go hand - in - hand , he insists			2
‘ we have a good number of evil mr @entity290 in our prisons , but many prisoners are badly messed up and we have to help them			0
whether you are the hardest hardliner or the woolliest liberal , every one of us has an interest in preventing reoffending			0

@entity299 the biggest prison regime shake - up for 60 years
designed to signal a tough new approach to law and order by @entity1
move will provoke fierce opposition from prison reformers
subscription satellite television channels , including @entity71 , will be banned – and *thousands* may lose the perk of having a tv in their cell .
more could be forced to wear drab grey prison *overalls* instead of their own clothes .
the right to use pocket money to buy *toiletries* and *sweets* in prison shops could be curbed .
prisoners who have gay relationships in jail will be barred from sharing cells – and even sent to separate jails .
prisoners who misbehave will forfeit the automatic right to be freed early .
