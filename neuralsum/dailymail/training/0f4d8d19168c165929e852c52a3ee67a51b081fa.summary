by @entity0 published : 15:55 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 16:55 est , 24 february 2013 a flurry of preparations is being made in the hope that @entity5 ’s only two giant pandas will mate			2
with the female panda only in season for less than 48 hours and the success rate in captivity notoriously low , the pressure for female @entity7 and male @entity8 at @entity9 is immense			1
zoo staff and experts , brought in from @entity15 , are doing all they can to prepare the pair including playing relaxing music in @entity8 ’s pen and managing a strict diet and training regime for both of them			1
panda preparations : it is hoped that @entity5 's only two giant pandas - female @entity7 ( left ) and male @entity8 ( right ) - will mate and preparations are taking place at @entity9 in the hope it will be a success if they succeed , the pandas ’ cubs will become the first born in the @entity5 , but it will also be a significant step in the fight to save the endangered species – there are just 1,500 remaining in the wild			1
already both pandas have started to show important changes in their behaviour which are encouraging signs that they are ready to mate soon			2
physical changes suggest that the ideal date for mating will be @entity44			0
the nine - year - old pair arrived from @entity46 at the @entity48 zoo in december 2011 but previous mating attempts have not been successful			1
as a contingency plan , experts from @entity15 have been brought in to perform artificial insemination on @entity7 as well as the hoped natural mating			1
@entity53 , director of giant pandas at @entity9 , said of the two methods being used : ‘ this follows the best practice methodology adopted by other panda - keeping zoos around the world and gives our giant pandas the best possible chance of success			1
’ body weight in food : the male is being fed more bamboo to increase his stamina			0
he is currently eating 110lbs a day but this will be increased to 220lb , his whole body weight in bamboo small window of opportunity : @entity7 will be in season for less than 48 hours and females are also known to be very selective on their mates , making the act of mating a very difficult process it is hoped the pandas will bear and rear cubs during their 10 - year stay at the zoo			1
the success rate of breeding giant pandas in captivity has been notoriously low			1
few zoos outside @entity46 have managed to achieve results			2
females are in season for such a small window and are also known to be very selective on their mates			0
@entity7 , which means sweetie , and @entity8 , which means sunshine , have been kept apart for their mating preparations since their unsuccessful attempt last year			1
@entity8 is being trained to stand on his hind quarters to strength his legs in preparation for doing the deed , which lasts just two minutes			2
reunion : the pandas have been able to glimpse each other through a grate as their reunion approaches in an attempt to ' tease ' them			0
they will be gradually introduced to each other as the date approaches a whistle and rewards such as carrots and apples have been used to encourage him to stand			0
@entity7 is also being trained to stand so zoo keepers can perform ultrasound scans to monitor her ovaries and womb , and hopefully the pregnancy			2
she has also been trained to urinate on cue making it easier for keepers to get samples to detect changes in her hormone levels which can indicate when the right moment for mating will be			0
indoor light timers have been fitted in both their pens to mimic outside sunlight levels so both pandas can undergo physiological changes at the same time			0
the male is being fed more bamboo to increase his stamina			0
he is currently eating 110lbs a day but this will be increased to 220lb which is almost his whole body weight in food			0
mr @entity53 told @entity145 : ‘ it is physically demanding for the male , as though he has got weight and power on his side , the female does not make it easy			2
encouraging sign : @entity8 recently started doing handstands against trees , walls and rocks , scent - marking as high up as possible , which is known as a display of virility in the wild ‘ we are training him to help him cope with that			2
‘ he has got to be physically , mentally and chemically pumped up			0
’ @entity7 ’s urine samples from when she was in season last year have been dabbed around @entity8 ’s pen to increase his hormone levels			1
in the wild , male pandas would track down the female in season by tracking the chemical signals given off by her urine			1
it also triggers hormonal and chemical changes in the male ’s body			0
@entity174 is being played in his pen as well to relax him after his adjustment to his new home has been difficult			0
@entity179 ’s fireworks , planes and high winds have unsettled him in the past			0
the pandas have also been able to glimpse each other through a grate as their reunion approaches in an attempt to ‘ tease ’ them			0
they will be gradually introduced to each other as the date approaches			0
mating call : @entity7 has already started calling out to the male which is common during breeding season , and her urine samples from when she was in season last year have been dabbed around @entity8 's pen to increase his hormone levels @entity8 recently started doing handstands against trees , walls and rocks , scent - marking as high up as possible , which is known as a display of virility in the wild			1
meanwhile @entity7 has already started calling out to the male which is common during breeding season			1
artificial insemination is fraught with danger for both pandas that will have to be put under general anaesthetic , but will be done to increase the chances of a successful mating season			2
staff will then have to wait 180 days until cubs are born			0
two incubators have been installed in at the zoo to give the cubs the best chance of surviving			0
breeding in captivity has become vital to the giant pandas ’ survival with the destruction of bamboo forests in @entity46 and south - east @entity227			1
the pair are the first giant pandas to come to the @entity5 in 17 years after a panda called @entity231 was sent back to @entity46 in 1994			1
two pandas were sent to the @entity5 from @entity46 in 1974 but were unsuccessful			1
currently there are 36 pandas in 15 zoos and parks outside of @entity46 .			2

female @entity7 and male @entity8 arrived from @entity46 in 2011
previous mating attempts in captivity have proved unsuccessful
breeding in captivity has a notoriously low success rate
@entity9 staff are doing all they can to prepare the pandas
