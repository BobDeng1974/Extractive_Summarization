a senior @entity1 head - injuries expert has clashed with the @entity2 over the presentation of concussion data contained in their annual injury audit			1
@entity2 head of medicine dr @entity7 this week published a report drawn up by a @entity11 student - which showed reported concussions in professional @entity13 had risen by more than 400 per cent in the last decade			1
@entity7 , whose position was supported by @entity15 and the @entity16 , claims the dramatic rise has been caused by increased awareness of a problem which was highlighted by the shambolic handling of @entity22 ’s double head injury in @entity23 ’ @entity25 opener against @entity26			1
@entity22 puts his hands on his knees and during @entity23 ' 21 - 16 loss to @entity26 at the @entity30 @entity31 ( bottom ) is inadvertently kicked in the face by @entity26 second row @entity34 on friday but that view is strongly contested by professor @entity37 , who sits on @entity1 ’s concussion advisory panel			1
‘ the underlying trend over 10 years in professional rugby has seen a year - on - year increase in concussions , ’ @entity37 told the @entity39			2
‘ i do not believe this has anything to do with greater awareness of concussion			0
instead , it reflects a steady rise in concussion rates over 10 years as on - field collisions have got bigger			0
‘ people are more aware because the problem is much greater than it ever used to be			0
’ attempting to tackle @entity26 fullback @entity56 ( centre right ) , @entity55 's momentum also takes @entity31 @entity22 lays poleaxed on the @entity30 turf after the nasty - looking collision on friday night the @entity60 - formerly known as the @entity62 - found that 86 concussions were reported last season , a rise of almost 60 per cent from the 2012 - 13 season			2
@entity15 ’s concussion rate of 10.5 per 1000 hours compares to 2.5 in 2002 when dr @entity7 initiated the data project			1
professional boxing has a concussion rate of 17.5 per 1000 hours and dr @entity7 admits rugby should brace itself for continued rises in future seasons			1
there was public outcry last weekend when @entity23 winger @entity31 was allowed to play on despite television replays appearing to show him knocked unconscious on two separate occasions against @entity26			2
the 22 - year - old ( left ) , missing a tackle on @entity82 , saw his game suffer after the first head injury @entity31 passed the controversial @entity85 after the first incident and was allowed to carry on playing following the second injury			0
‘ if @entity31 had been a boxer he would have been removed from the arena after his first concussion and taken for neurological assessment , ’ said @entity37			0
‘ a brain - injured boxer would have stood down for a minimum 28 days			0
‘ i would say the level of brain injury in professional rugby has now become unacceptable , ’ @entity37 added .			0

@entity23 wing @entity22 suffered two head injuries against @entity26
@entity2 file showed reported concussions in professional @entity13 had risen by more than 400 per cent in the last decade
