paedophile @entity18 and pr guru @entity19 have both been arrested and bailed as part of @entity21 mr @entity12 , who has specialised in prosecuting child grooming cases , said those due to be detained were not directly linked to @entity24 – regarded as @entity26 ’s most prolific predatory paedophile			1
instead , he said , they were among the ‘ others ’ identified by detectives as having committed similar alleged offences			1
‘ this is a growing industry , ’ said mr @entity12			2
‘ there are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks			2
some are very high - profile figures			2
’ he added : ‘ they are people whose names have come forward because of the high profile of child abuse in recent months			2
there are people you will be interested in			2
’ mr @entity12 ’s comments came as he took part in a @entity46 seminar on tackling child abuse , organised by the @entity49 think tank			2
historic claims : the @entity8 scandal has prompted a wave of fresh accusations against several celebrities his comments are likely to prompt a backlash from showbusiness personalities who claim they are the victim of a post-savile ‘ celebrity witch - hunt ’			1
as chief crown prosecutor for the @entity62 , mr @entity12 is overseeing the prosecution of former it ’s a knockout presenter @entity64 over historic child sex allegations			1
mr @entity64 , 83 , has described the claims as ‘ pernicious , callous , cruel and above all spurious ’			2
mr @entity12 is also overseeing the prosecution of @entity69 actor @entity68 , 48 , who is charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape , indecent assault and sexual activity			0
privately , a number of senior police and legal figures were stunned that mr @entity12 , tipped by some as a potential future @entity80 , had chosen to hype up the impending arrests of yet more celebrities for alleged child sex abuse			1
@entity85 claims : @entity86 outside his home in @entity88 yesterday @entity86 yesterday insisted his ‘ conscience is clear ’ as he faced a fresh wave of sex assault claims			1

@entity86 , 67 , who was bailed until april , said his reputation has been ‘ tarnished and dragged through the mud ’ despite nothing having been proved against him			0
outside his £ 1million @entity88 mansion he said : ‘ the last four months have been extraordinary			0
allegations which i strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which i have given full and complete answers			0
' i have fully co-operated and my conscience is clear			0
they are carrying out a wide - ranging investigation concerning allegations made against many people over many decades			0
‘ i ’m simply one of those people			0
i ask you to take into account that i was not and have not been charged with anything by the police			0
’ the original claims against @entity86 involved two adult women who claimed he molested them in the 1970s and 80s			0
one was former @entity122 presenter @entity121 , 55 , who said he groped her while she was reading the news on @entity124			0
the @entity126 presenter , who was taken off air after his first arrest , said his wife had been ‘ extremely distressed ’ at the way he has been treated			0
he added that he has had ‘ amazing support ’ from many people			0
but child protection campaigners believe his comments reflect mounting concern that police failed to protect young girls from @entity24 and other predatory celebrities suspected of decades of offending			1
earlier this week @entity140 warned in a highly critical report that officers had repeatedly failed to respond to evidence of @entity145 ’s criminal activities over nearly 50 years			0
detective chief superintendent @entity146 , the head of @entity148 ’s child abuse command , told the @entity49 meeting , however , that more offenders would now be brought to justice and said cases being reported to the @entity154 had ‘ rocketed up the scale ’ since the @entity145 scandal broke			1
meanwhile , 11 more alleged offenders have been arrested or questioned under @entity21 , set up by the @entity154 to investigate crimes by @entity8 and his accomplices , plus other historic sex abuse crimes			1
those arrested include pr consultant @entity19 , comedian @entity161 and dj @entity86 , who all deny any wrongdoing			1
last night a @entity13 spokesman , asked about mr @entity12 ’s comments , said : ‘ this is an operational matter for the police			1
’ @entity148 indicated its officers were not intending to make any new celebrity arrests , prompting speculation that mr @entity12 was referring to planned arrests in the @entity62			0
