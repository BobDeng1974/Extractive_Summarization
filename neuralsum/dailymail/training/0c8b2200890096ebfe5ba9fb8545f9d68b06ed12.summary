i found it more interesting than @entity38 because you can pick up a color from another color			0
and you can work very fast			2
and that 's something every draftsman is interested in , ' @entity1 told the @entity46			0
the @entity10 's mobility also appealed			1

@entity1 's research , and subsequent book - secret knowledge : rediscovering the @entity104 - has resulted in the latest exhibition which includes work created on @entity10 and video cameras , as well as more traditional methods			1
' like an artist alchemist , in one minute @entity1 uses a fancy digital device to make a colorful @entity10 drawing ; in the next he shows us that he is one of our greatest draftsmen by rendering an exactingly detailed charcoal drawing of a forest scene in @entity118 , ' @entity109 , of the @entity110 , said			1
