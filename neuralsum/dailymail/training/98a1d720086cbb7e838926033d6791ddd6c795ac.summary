you know the look , do n't you			0
their eyes glaze over , they look over your shoulder for a distraction and before long you 're in a one - way conversation to nowhere			0
what is it about reliving holiday experiences which makes even best friends and family fail to take an interest - and us feel all the poorer for it ? a new paper by @entity16 called @entity18 claims to have worked it out			1
psychologists have proved once and for all that having superior experiences will make people dislike you psychologists @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 found that we seek out extraordinary experiences ; from yachting with celebrities off the coast of @entity32 , to climbing mountains , detoxing in exotic spas and sampling rare wines			1
more importantly , though , while we thoroughly enjoy having these superior experiences to our peers , the feeling is spoiled by subsequent conversations with them which ultimately leave us feeling worse than if we had a more ordinary , relate - able trip			2
the reason ? uncommon experiences make us at once ' alien and enviable ' and leave you feeling left out			1
the @entity16 scientists proved the theory with tests on lots of small groups of people			1
@entity16 : paper was published by the @entity16 and called @entity53 in each case one person was given an amusing video clip of a talented street magician to watch while others a low budget animation			1
researchers told everyone whether they were getting the average or better footage then asked them to rate how happy they felt directly after watching it			2
the group reassembled and and chatted for some time about whatever they wanted			0
after that , they were asked to rate their happiness again			1
the results were , in a nutshell , those who 'd watched the premium video felt immediately happier but after speaking to their peers felt excluded and a lot worse than those who had seen the cartoon			2
how to lose friends and alienate people ? tell them how brilliant your yachting holiday to @entity32 was those who had the mundane experience were united by it and enjoyed sharing common ground making them happier overall			0
' at worst , people may be envious and resentful of those who have had an extraordinary experience , and at best , they may find themselves with little to talk about , ' wrote the paper 's authors			1
as leading psychologist @entity25 paraphrases : ' if an experience turns you into someone who has nothing in common with others , then no matter how good it was , it wo n't make you happy in the long run			0
' helicopter skiing might make an incredible trip but talking about it will alienate people and make them envious an abstract from the paper reads : ' people seek extraordinary experiences - from drinking rare wines and taking exotic vacations to jumping from airplanes and shaking hands with celebrities			2
' but are such experiences worth having ? ' we found that participants thoroughly enjoyed having experiences that were superior to those had by their peers , but that having had such experiences spoiled their subsequent social interactions and ultimately left them feeling worse than they would have felt if they had had an ordinary experience instead			0
' participants were able to predict the benefits of having an extraordinary experience but were unable to predict the costs			0
' these studies suggest that people may pay a surprising price for the experiences they covet most			0

uncommon experiences make us ' alien and enviable ' according to paper
at worst , your friends may be ' resentful ' and , at best , having nothing to say
