from allegations of sexism to claims of fakery , it seems @entity6 ' latest tv show is never far from controversy , and producers are now back in hot water again			0
it has been revealed that starving competitors on the survival show hunted and killed an endangered crocodile during filming after the show 's bosses mistook it for a more common species			1
male competitors had not eaten for two weeks when they tracked down and killed what the show 's producers thought was a common caiman - a small , relatively common reptile			1
while the animal 's exact numbers in the wild are unknown , conservationists are in agreement that illegal hunting and habitat destruction have left it critically endangered			2
most @entity29 states in which the creature is native , along with islands in the @entity45 , parts of @entity42 and @entity43 have all passed laws protecting the creature			2
according to @entity52 , the show 's producers had surveyed the islands used during the show before contestants were set loose , trying to identify any animals which would be off - limits for hunting			0
a spokesman for @entity58 said the islands used in the show were surveyed to establish what wildlife lived there before filming , and it was not known that @entity29 crocodiles ( pictured ) could be found there while several caimans had been discovered , it was not known that the @entity29 crocodile also lived there until the competitors found it			1
the episode in which the animal is killed on a remote island off @entity73 , @entity74 , will be screened tonight			0
a spokesman for @entity58 , which produced the show , said : ' this was a genuine and regrettable error			0
prior to filming experts were consulted to ascertain species on both islands and the @entity29 crocodile was not known to be in the area or on the island			1
' the relevant national environment agency are aware of the incident and have granted a licence to replace the animal which has now been done			0
