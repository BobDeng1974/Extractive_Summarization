former @entity0 and @entity1 midfielder @entity2 has been revealed as the highest earning @entity4 player , despite never having played for his club			1
the 32 - year - old @entity6 , who signed for @entity8 in june and was immediately loaned to @entity9 , earns just over £ 4.4million a year , which works out at £ 84,000 per week			1
@entity10 forward @entity11 ( £ 2.76m ) , meanwhile , earns more than @entity13 legend @entity12 ( £ 2.67m ) does at the @entity14			1
former @entity16 and @entity17 midfielder @entity15 is the highest earning @entity18 in the @entity4 the @entity4 's highest earner , @entity2 signed for @entity8 in june but immediately joined @entity9 on loan @entity21 secured a lucrative move to @entity23 earlier this year , but a return is not out of the question @entity2 £ 4.4m ( £ 84,000 per week ) @entity15 £ 4.1m ( £ 78,000 per week ) @entity26 £ 3.9m ( £ 75,000 per week ) @entity21 £ 3.8m ( £ 73,000 per week ) @entity27 £ 2.8m ( £ 53,000 per week ) @entity11 £ 2.76m ( £ 53,000 per week ) @entity12 £ 2.67m ( £ 51,000 per week ) @entity28 £ 2.22m ( £ 42,000 per week ) @entity29 £ 1.99m ( £ 38,000 per week ) @entity30 £ 1.59m ( £ 30,000 per week ) but more staggering than wages of the high earners is the discrepancy between those players and their less talented , and less fortunate , team - mates			1
many players in the league earn as little as £ 22,000 a year , or £ 420 a week , which is less than the average salary in the @entity40			1
to put that into perspective , it would take @entity44 three and a half years to earn what his @entity23 team - mate @entity26 does in a week			2
moreover , when @entity15 joined @entity48 from @entity49 last summer , his salary was more than the entire payroll for 15 of the 19 @entity4 teams			0
a number of other former @entity54 players are also earning high salaries in the @entity18			2
the evergreen @entity56 picks up an annual salary more than £ 1m while @entity58 earns around £ 750,000 a year			0
@entity59 , who has scored 25 goals in 35 games for @entity14 , earns £ 230,000 annually			0
@entity13 legend @entity12 , who moved to @entity14 in 2010 , is the seventh highest @entity4 earner @entity26 , who plays for @entity23 , is the third highest earner on the list behind @entity15 and @entity2 former @entity49 man @entity11 earns more than his one time north @entity66 rival @entity12 @entity67 , who joined the recently formed @entity68 from @entity69 during the summer , is listed as earning just £ 60,000 a year			1
the figure is misleading , though , as the majority of his salary is currently being paid by @entity75 side @entity73 , where he is currently on loan			0
similarly , @entity78 is not included on the list because he is not due to return from his loan at @entity81 until 2015			0
regardless of some of the smaller numbers on show , the growth of the league is clear to see			0
in 2013 there were just seven players earning more than a million dollars annually			0
in 2014 that number has more than doubled , and that does n't even include the full salaries of @entity78 and @entity67 who are likely to take the total number of million - dollar players to 17			2
like @entity96 's facebook page			0
@entity56 , still just 29 - years - old , earns over £ 1m annually with @entity4 side @entity48 @entity67 is listed as earning £ 60,000 a year , but @entity73 are currently paying most of his wages @entity59 has scored 25 goals in 35 games for @entity14 but earns just £ 4,000 a week			1

@entity8 's @entity2 the highest paid player in the @entity4
seven former @entity54 players in the top 10 highest paid
@entity11 earns more than @entity12
some @entity4 players earn just £ 420 a week - less than average wage in @entity40
@entity67 getting just £ 60,000 from @entity68 in 2014
