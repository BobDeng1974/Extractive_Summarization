@entity0 has branded @entity2 ’s contract offer unacceptable - and confirmed he wants a longer deal to stay at @entity4			1
the 31 - year - old is out of contract at the end of the season and it ’s understood a 12 - month extension is all that has been put forward to date			1
commons - being tracked by @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 - is adamant he wants to remain with @entity17 ’s side but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward			1
@entity0 ( centre ) believes his latest contract offer from @entity2 is unacceptable speaking after he scored in thursday night ’s disappointing 4 - 3 @entity24 defeat to @entity25 , @entity0 said : ‘ where do we stand at the moment ? i really do n’t know			1
a lot has been said in the press and i do n’t want to add more fuel to the fire			2
‘ has an offer been made ? not that i want to sign			1
‘ it ’s not in my hands			2
it ’s down to the club , the board , the manager			2
if they want me here , they ’ll keep me here			2
‘ i ’ve reiterated many times that i want to stay here			1
i ’ve loved playing football for @entity2 and have a great rapport with the fans			1
‘ i ’ve enjoyed four very successful years but there comes a time when you do need your future sorted out and the clock is ticking			2
‘ no doubt they deem the offer at the minute is something they feel is worthy of myself			1
but that ’s where the sticking point is			2
i think i warrant something else			2
’ asked if it was about the length of the contract rather than finance , @entity0 replied : ‘ yes			1
’ commons in action during @entity2 's 4 - 3 @entity24 defeat against @entity25 @entity17 admitted recently that @entity2 had to be careful about offering lengthier deals to older players			1
and the current impasse leaves it looking all the more likely that @entity0 ’ time at the club could be nearing its end			1
after the @entity76 defeat , @entity17 was more immediately concerned by @entity2 ’s defensive frailties in the dead rubber in @entity79			1
aghast that his team had scored three goals - through commons , @entity84 and an own goal from @entity86 - but still lost the match , the @entity80 insisted his players would have to improve ahead of the knockout stages			2
‘ it was a poor performance			0
we were not 100 per cent and there was a lack of intensity and aggression , ’ said @entity17 , whose team had already qualified for the last - 32 as @entity92 runners - up			0
‘ it was disappointing we were n’t up for the game			0
we scored three goals , that was a positive and i think the substitutes ( @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 ) were positive when they came on , but defensively we gave away too many chances and conceded four goals			0
‘ you should win when you score three goals away in @entity110			0
commons is adamant he wants to remain with @entity2 but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward ‘ individually , there were some bad performances but also as a team			1
as a back four we dropped too much and there was a lot of space between the defence and midfield			0
they ( @entity123 ) got three chances from that at the start of the second - half			0
‘ we were talking before the game about being compact and no balls in between us and we did n’t get that at the beginning of the second half			0
‘ we were too open , that was the problem			0
we had the chance to win at 2 - 1 and it was disappointing we gave away the victory			0
@entity17 's side were beaten by @entity25 in the dead rubber match on thursday night ‘ we have to take this with us to the next stage			0
we have the players but we have to think about the formation when we play away in @entity110 and what kind of players we use			0
we were more offensive than we have been and we conceded too many goals			0
’ admitting he will have a re-think on tactics once he finds out who @entity2 have drawn on monday - with @entity150 or @entity151 potential opponents - @entity17 added : ‘ we have to be a lot , lot better in the next round			1
‘ we will have players back who will give us more spirit so i am not frightened about that			0
but it was disappointing to give the victory away like we did , from being 2 - 1 up			0

@entity0 admits he is *n't* happy with @entity2 contract offer
commons : ' has an offer been made ? not that i want to sign '
but the midfielder insists he wants to stay at @entity4
