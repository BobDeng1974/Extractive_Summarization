forensic staff could not find any conclusive evidence of mr @entity3 s dna on a torn condom given to @entity6 police by one of the alleged victims lawyers for @entity11 founder @entity10 have revealed that a key piece of evidence does not contain his dna			1
a torn condom given to @entity6 police by one of the alleged victims was examined by staff at two forensic laboratories but they could not find any conclusive evidence of mr @entity10 ’s dna on it			1
the same forensic teams found @entity19 thought to belong to the @entity11 boss on another condom , which was submitted by the second alleged victim			2
the revelation is contained in a 100 - page police report that was written after witnesses were interviewed and forensic evidence had been examined			0
the report , which has been seen by mr @entity10 ’s lawyers , has led to the @entity6 authorities requesting his extradition from @entity33 to stand trial , though he is yet to be charged with any offence			1
mr @entity10 , who denies allegations of rape and sexual molestation , has been fighting extradition to @entity6 for the past two years			2
he claims it is a ruse to send him to the @entity41 where he could face trial for espionage			2
the 41 - year - old is currently holed up in the @entity45 after being granted asylum by the country ’s president , @entity47			0
in the report , the first alleged victim , now 33 , claims she was sexually molested by mr @entity10 at her flat in @entity52 on several occasions			1
she also claims that mr @entity10 deliberately ripped a condom before wearing it so that he could have unprotected sex with her against her will			1
@entity10 is currently holed up in the @entity45 after being granted asylum by the country 's president , @entity47			0
his lawyers have said that the fact no dna could be found conclusively on an apparently used condom suggests a fake one may have been submitted			0
the report also appears to cast doubt on the claim made by the second alleged victim , who told police that she was ‘ raped ’ by mr @entity10 when she was asleep			1
but during a police interview , the woman , now 29 , apparently suggests that she did not mind him having unprotected sex with her			0
the @entity6 prosecutor ’s office refused to comment on the report but said the case was ongoing .			0

but its thought another condom , submitted by the second alleged victim , does .
