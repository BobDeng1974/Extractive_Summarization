by @entity0 published : 03:54 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 04:19 est , 1 february 2013 a @entity2 grandmother sentenced to death by firing squad for smuggling cocaine into @entity6 has lost her @entity8 battle to force the @entity2 government to help her appeal			1
@entity11 , 56 , was accused by the court of damaging the image of @entity6 and received the sentence despite prosecutors asking for only a 15 - year jail term			1
her family took legal action after the @entity2 @entity19 refused to help pay for ' an adequate lawyer ' so she can launch an appeal			1
mrs @entity31 , sitting with mrs justice @entity32 , said the court understood ' the deep concerns of @entity35 and her family about mrs @entity11 's predicament ' but her case must be dismissed for reasons to be given on monday next week			2
the @entity8 was told that a notice of appeal was filed with @entity43 officials earlier this week and she was given a 14 - day deadline to file grounds of appeal			0
@entity47 said @entity11 was urgently in need of funding because she is without legal assistance and her family have exhausted all of their available resources			0
her sister @entity24 is terrified that @entity11 , who is locked up in @entity6 's notorious @entity54 , will run out of time to launch an appeal against her death sentence , which must be filed by february 12			1
but with the family 's finances dried up , the search for a top lawyer who will take on mrs @entity11 's appeal for little or no payment has so far defied the desperate efforts of mrs @entity24			1
' unless i can get someone to help , i fear the worst for @entity11 , ' she said as she arrived at the gates of the prison on her daily visit			0
' with no appeal launched the death sentence moves along			0
' and she has told the legal rights charity reprieve : ' i ca n't imagine what we will do if we miss the opportunity to save @entity11 's life			0
' staying in a cheap hotel in @entity6 , mrs @entity24 can not even afford to pay the travelling expenses of an @entity43 lawyer who has offered to take on the case for no payment			2
neither mrs @entity11 nor or sister have any hope of raising money by selling their story as @entity2 laws prevent convicted people and their families from benefiting financially from their crimes			1
mrs @entity24 admits she is in a ' terrifying position ' as she struggles to find ways to help her sister when she does not speak @entity43 and has not found any assistance in understanding how the country 's criminal justice system works			0
the two women have turned to the @entity2 government for help – if for nothing more than to cover the costs of a lawyer who will act for mrs @entity11 for no fee			1
caught : @entity11 was arrested at @entity6 's international airport with 10.6lb of cocaine in her possession death sentence : the court told the grandmother she had shamed @entity6 's tourism reputation by smuggling cocaine in the lining of her suitcase through the island 's international airport the @entity2 grandmother is being kept in @entity54 jail in @entity6 , @entity43			1
her appeal must be filed by february 12 but the government has made it clear it does not pay for the legal representation of its citizens arrested in other countries			1
' i am so scared that we will lose the chance to appeal , ' mrs @entity24 told the charity group			0
' a lawyer should have started work on the case a week ago and every day that goes by is a day that @entity11 loses for preparing her appeal			2
' we have nowhere else to turn			0
we desperately need the help of the @entity19 to ensure that @entity11 has a lawyer			2
' even if she finds a lawyer to launch her appeal , mrs @entity11 , originally from @entity136 , faces up to eight years in prison as her pleas for a lesser sentence grind through the notoriously slow @entity43 courts			2
even the first week since she was given the death sentence has proved a nightmare , with mrs @entity11 hardly moving from her cell for exercise			0
convicted of carrying 10lbs of cocaine , worth £ 1.7million when she arrived at @entity146 last year , she spends most of the time sleeping in her small cell , which she has to share with several other women			1
a warder said mrs @entity11 was ' deeply depressed ' and found little comfort even when her sister visited her each day			0
mrs @entity24 has been telling her sister of her efforts outside the jail to find a lawyer – but both women are aware that the clock is ticking away against the condemned grandmother .			0

@entity11 , 56 , sentenced to death in @entity6 after being found with 10lbs of cocaine worth an estimated £ 1.7million
