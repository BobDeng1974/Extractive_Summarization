it was always going to be a tough battle to claim the title of @entity4 ’s brainiest child			1
but viewers of @entity6 have questioned whether the @entity8 show went too far as two boys were shown sobbing after losing the competition			1
when maths prodigy @entity12 , 11 , was defeated by eventual winner @entity13 the cameras zoomed in for a close - up shot of him bursting into tears			1
@entity12 , who has an a * in maths at @entity26 , was level on points with @entity13 after correctly answering 16 questions on particle physics			1
they faced a tie - break until @entity13 successfully challenged a wrong answer ruling on her specialist subject of the @entity35 , meaning she won the point and got through to the final two			2
as the boys were shown in tears , viewers took to @entity40 to criticise the ‘ cruel ’ competition			1
' exploited ' : viewers took to @entity40 to brand the programme ' horrible ' as maths prodigy @entity12 , 11 , ( left ) lost to eventual champion @entity13 , 11 ( right ) one wrote : ‘ @entity12 , you ’re breaking my heart ! # @entity46 – what a horrible competition ! ’ another tweeted : ‘ this programme is terrible – too much pressure on the kids			1
’ afterwards , @entity12 ’s father @entity52 said he should be proud of himself for getting as far as he did			2
physicist dr @entity53 , who set the string theory questions , told @entity12 that most people needed a phd to understand the subject and that he was ‘ remarkable ’			2

last night @entity92 , chief executive of children ’s welfare charity @entity94 , criticised the show for ‘ exploiting ’ children by filming them in ‘ visible emotional distress ’			1
she said : ‘ a number of the parents were sadly too preoccupied with the end goal and their own ambitions to realise that their children were being taken beyond safe levels of endurance			0
‘ we also have to ask what aspects of intelligence were being tested , and what was the point of pushing these bright young minds “ to their limits ” , in for the most part , pointless tasks devoid of real context			0
the need to consider the nurturing and development of the whole child was ignored in favour of cruel entertainment			0
’ the competition is overseen by @entity125 and featured children aged seven to 12			1
a @entity8 spokesman said chaperones and a psychologist were available for the children during and after filming and the families were happy with the show			1
