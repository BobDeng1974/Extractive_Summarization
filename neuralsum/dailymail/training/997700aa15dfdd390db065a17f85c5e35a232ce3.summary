former @entity1 presidential nominee @entity0 dished about an awkward encounter with a masseuse during the 2012 campaign while appearing on the inaugural installment of @entity6 show with @entity7 on monday evening			1
asked by co-host @entity11 what his ' single weirdest experience ' as a presidential candidate was , @entity0 revealed that after shaking too many hands at an event in @entity15 , @entity16 , once , ' i began to get kind of a kink in my back			1
' and so i asked ... the guy who traveled with me ... i said , " can you find someone to get me a back massage at the hotel tonight ? " not running : former @entity1 presidential nominee @entity0 reiterated on monday that he 's not planning to pursue the presidency for a third time in 2016 ' and he got a massage therapist , i think , from the @entity28 to come over and come in our room , ' @entity0 said			1
' and so he sat there to make sure that we had two people there at all times			0
and she gave me a massage			0
' and after i left to go get changed and showered and so forth , she turned to him and she said , " is he a dancer ? " ' @entity0 told @entity11 and with @entity43 's other co-host @entity42 , ' that was the best compliment i have ever had			1
' the former @entity45 governor went on to explain that the woman thought he was a dancer because , as she said , ' " he has strong legs			1
" ' ' they 're bird legs , actually , but she thought they were strong , ' he said , laughing			1
the interview with @entity0 was nearly as awkward as his experience with the masseuse , with @entity11 asking for his thoughts on @entity57 in the @entity59 age and potential image problems for the @entity59 family 's dog , whose name is , coincidentally , @entity64			1
at the end of the show the @entity11 and @entity42 showed @entity0 a family portrait and asked him to name all 21 of his grandchildren			2
after realizing half way through that @entity0 , 67 , does in fact know and recognize the offspring of his five sons , @entity70 begged him to stop			2
@entity0 also dished on his ' single weirdest experience ' on the campaign trail , explaining it involved a masseuse who thought he was a dancer because he has ' strong legs ' the interview was n't all fluff , with the trio taking a few minutes to discuss president @entity86 's decision not to leave a limited number of troops behind in @entity89 after the @entity90 handed control of the country back to the @entity89 people - @entity0 thinks he should have - and whether foreign policy will be a voting issue in november - @entity0 says it will			1
@entity11 and @entity42 did n't let @entity0 leave the set without commenting on his much talked about 2016 comeback campaign , which the retired @entity1 politician assured them it is not in the cards			2
commenting on his wife 's suggestion last month that her husband 's potential candidacy would hinge on former @entity104 gov. @entity103 's plans , @entity0 called @entity103 ' an excellent person ' and said he ' could be a terrific president			2
' ' i think that about a lot of the people who are running on the @entity1 side , ' he added			0
' my guess is you 're gon na see 15 or so people on the stage at the first debate			0
' among those people we 're gon na find someone who catches fire , who ignites the interests of the @entity1 base , and you 're gon na see someone who can go on to become president			0
' @entity42 noted that @entity0 has left the ' door open ' for another run during an interview in late august when he claimed that ' circumstances change			0
' ' and then i went on to say , i 'm not letting my head go there , where i 'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person , who cares about the kinds of issues i care about , ' @entity0 replied , trying yet again to tamp down expectations for his political career			0
@entity0 said he would be looking to endorse someone in 2016 who cares about foreign policy , economy and the ' looming issue of poverty , ' which he said in an important issue ' that 's not being addressed .			0
