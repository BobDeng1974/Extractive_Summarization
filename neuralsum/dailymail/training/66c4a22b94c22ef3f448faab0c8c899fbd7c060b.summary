by @entity0 a three - year - old who was given an egg as an @entity4 present was not allowed to have his name on the chocolate - because he shares his name with footballer @entity8			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , was told that having just @entity8 on the egg would cause ' copyright issues '			1
yet @entity13 law states that a person 's name can not be subject to copyright			1
his mother @entity22 ( r ) called the shop 's behaviour ' barmy ' his mother , @entity22 - @entity25 , said that staff at @entity27 in @entity29 town centre , near @entity10 , would not inscribe @entity8 's name on the egg because they were concerned they would be breaching copyright			1
but staff agreed that the little boy could have his full name , @entity9 , on the chocolate			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' it 's madness because why have they agreed to put his full name on it ? @entity8 is named after @entity43 player @entity8 ( @entity44 )			1
the surname of the family is coincidentally the same as retired player @entity48 ( r ) who spent his career at @entity43 ' surely if they ca n't do one then they ca n't do both , it 's beyond belief ' mrs @entity9 is a huge @entity43 fan and also has a tattoo of former player @entity56 on her arm			1
she also has two cats called @entity56 and @entity59 , named after @entity60 player @entity59 who left @entity43 in 2012			2
she said that she did not think @entity8 ' would be bothered in the slightest ' because he has children of his own			0
' what should have been a nice surprise for @entity4 has turned into a total farce , ' she added			0
mother @entity66 was outraged when the shop in @entity29 , @entity10 refused to write just her son 's first name on the egg mrs @entity9 branded the shop 's behaviour ' barmy '			1
the mother - of - four from @entity74 said : ' it ’s just pathetic that they would n’t let a childhave his name on an @entity70 for fear of upsetting @entity8			2
' it ’s just nonsense anyway			0
@entity8 is his name , does that mean he ’s not allowed to have his name on anything because he shares it with a famous footballer ? ' she said that she had been upset by the fact that @entity8 could not just have his first name on the egg because it made the present ' impersonal			2
she said having his full name on the chocolate looking ' a bit silly really '			1
' my neighbour @entity93 actually bought the egg for @entity8 as a treat but the staff told her point blank that they would n't put his first name on it because of copyright , ' mrs @entity9 said			1
mrs @entity9 other son is called @entity104 but the choice preceded the arrival of @entity107 footballer @entity104 who has now left the club			1
she said that she called her youngest child @entity8 as a tribute to the man who has been her favourite player ' for years ' ' just because of his style of play and the way he carries the team '			0
' i had a couple of nervy moments when it looked like @entity8 might be off to @entity119 in the summer but thankfully he stayed where he belongs , ' she added			0
a spokesman for @entity27 said : ' @entity27 apologises for the service provided to ms. @entity9 at the weekend			1
' @entity123 does abide by copyright laws but these were not applicable in this case			2
' our free @entity127 easter eggs service is something that our customers enjoy and are usually delighted with and we are very sorry that this was not the case in this instance			0
' a spokesman for @entity8 declined to comment			0
staff at the store refused to comment on the incident			2
according to @entity138 & @entity139 , in 2002 , the same year @entity8 burst onto the scene at @entity141 , three babies in @entity13 were named @entity8			0
the following year , 2003 , seven babies were given the name			0
in 2004 , the year he joined @entity43 , the number of babies given the name was eight , bringing the total over three years to 18			0
the name flopped in 2007 when no parents imitated the footballer - perhaps reflecting @entity138 's poor showing at the 2006 @entity154 - but in 2008 was resurrected again when three babies used the name			0
for three years 2009 - 2011 , no parents picked @entity8 as a name for their newborn before five babies called @entity8 were brought into the world in 2012			0
since 1999 , 42 babies have been named @entity8 , according to records			0
the last recorded data from 2012 showed that the most popular boy 's name was @entity167			0
number of babies named @entity8 by year , ranked by popularity @entity8 , 19 , in 2005 while at @entity43 1999 : three , ranked 2943 2000 : none 2001 : none 2002 : three , ranked 3225 2003 : seven , ranked 1962 2004 : eight , ranked 1878 2005 : four , ranked 3208 2006 : @entity172 , ranked 1892 2007 : none 2008 : three , 4432 2009 : none 2010 : none 2011 : none 2012 : five , ranked 3416 @entity8 is pictured with the egg which was an @entity4 present from a family friend			2
his mother @entity22 said that @entity4 had now become a ' total farce ' @entity8 has a brother , @entity104 , 16 , but the teenager was named before the arrival of @entity107 midfielder @entity104			1

@entity9 , three , told he could not have his first name on the egg
staff at @entity27 , @entity29 , said it would *create* ' copyright issues '
yet they agreed to let him have his full name inscribed on the chocolate
