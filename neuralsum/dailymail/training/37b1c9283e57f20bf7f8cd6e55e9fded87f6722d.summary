but this dust devil was spotted by a man in a field round the back of his house - near @entity10			1
@entity11 filmed the whirlwind whipping up straw and soil to around 100ft in the air in @entity16 , @entity17			1
he uploaded it onto his @entity28 page and @entity29			0
mr @entity11 said : ' i could n’t believe it when i saw it - i ’ve never seen anything like it			2
' i just came round the corner and could see a vortex going round about 40ft away			0
' there was n’t any wind and it was perfectly still , but i could see this straw flying up in the air			0
' there had obviously just been a harvest and the straw was all lined up			0
' it was like a mini tornado - a very @entity45 tornado			2
' dust devils are formed when hot air rises quickly through a small pocket of cooler , low - pressure air above it			1
if conditions are right , the air starts to rotate			0
more hot air rushes in towards the developing vortex to replace the air that is rising and the spinning intensifies , leading to a chimney - like funnel through which hot air travels upwards and in a circular motion			2
the column is kept stable - for a time at least - by the cool air that stops rising within the spinning outer wall of hot air			0
the spinning also causes the column to move forward			0
dust devils usually end very suddenly when surrounding cold air starts to be sucked in , often if they are not moving quickly enough or if they hit an area of cooler terrain			1
flat and barren land , light winds , cool atmospheric temperatures and clear skies are the optimum conditions for dust devils to occur			1
funnel : the rising and falling column of hot air whips up debris in its path mr @entity11 said : ' it was an amazing sight but it was going so high up in the air - i was a bit worried about what would happen if any of the straw got sucked into an aircraft			0
' the reaction i ’ve had to the footage has been brilliant - everyone ’s been saying how amazing the dust devil looks			1
' they are not generally powerful enough to cause extensive damage , as they are often less than 3ft in diameter , with an average maximum wind speed of 45mph			0
however , some have been recorded reaching a diameter of 300ft , with winds over 60mph and lasting more than 20 minutes - and some injuries and even deaths have occurred			2
in 2000 , a dust devil destroyed a fairground in @entity107 , @entity108 and injured several people , and in 2003 , a roof was lifted off a building in @entity112 , killing a man inside			1
dust devils have also contributed to more than 100 air accidents - some fatal			1
dust devils have also been recorded on the surface of @entity118 .			1

dust devil filmed near @entity16 , @entity17
local man took 45 - second video of natural phenomenon on camera phone
dust devils usually *harmless* - though some *fatalities* have occurred
*electrical* activity caused by mini whirlwind can *disrupt* *computers* and phone *signals*
