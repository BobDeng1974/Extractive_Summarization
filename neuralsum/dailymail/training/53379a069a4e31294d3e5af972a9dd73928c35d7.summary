by @entity0 published : 13:45 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 27 november 2012 it may not be the most obvious solution to keep the flooding at bay			0
but homeowner @entity5 held back 2ft of flood water by sealing his property with plasticine			1
the 32 - year - old was bestowed the advice by his neighbour @entity11 , who successfully protected his own home from gushing torrents using the modelling clay			1
@entity11 , 70 , from @entity15 , with the plasticine he used to save his neighbour 's house from flooding after protecting his own home using the material mr @entity5 was horrified when a torrent breached flood gates at his 17th century cottage in @entity15 , @entity24			1
after mr @entity11 's suggestion of clay , mr @entity5 sealed the doors before fleeing through a window			1
when he returned home the next day he was delighted to find just a few inches of water on the ground - compared to 2ft in neighbouring homes			1
mr @entity5 , an account manager for cheese producer @entity34 , said : ' our house was flooded 12 years ago and so the old owner had flood gates installed			1
' but the water began coming over the top of them , which was horrific			2
' i was outside my home wondering what i could do when my neighbour @entity45 came over with a sack of plasticine			1
sticky situation : mr @entity11 holding the trusty clay which has prevented two houses being submerged in flood waters ' the water was already up to my knees around the back of the house , around 18 inches deep			1
i quickly put the plasticine around the back porch and door frame			1
' i then used it to plug gaps in the flood gates , even though it was raining , and our front door too			2
' it definitely contributed to us not getting flooded like a lot of our neighbours			0
they had a couple of feet			0
' mr @entity5 and wife @entity70 , 30 , who works part time in insurance , moved into their picturesque two - bedroomed home three years ago			1
the area regularly floods in heavy rain and so many of the properties have flood gates installed outside			2
the two families in @entity15 , @entity24 , sealed the windows and doors with the plasticine mr @entity11 , 70 , his neighbour who brought over the sack of commercial plasticine for professional model makers , said : ' we have a very old house and outside we have air bricks and in order to stop the water getting in i just make a sheet of the plasticine and then put it around them			1
' it is incredible how water tight it is			0
it just fills the gaps			0
' i passed some to @entity5 after i had done my house because i saw him flailing around and complaining the water was seeping through into his house			1
' i told him to try the plasticine and he did and it stopped seeping in			0
he pushed it in between the cracks and it stopped the water			0
' we have a problem in the sense that we are very susceptible to the water just tanking up , the flood waters just stops there and does n’t move			2
' this is the third flooding i have experienced , i did n’t use the plasticine the first time but i did the last time and it worked			0
' so when i saw this guy getting frantic the idea flashed back into my head			0
' water began pouring into the couple 's home at around midnight on saturday , following hours of torrential rain that battered the @entity125			0
they fled the property with 16 - month - old daughter @entity128 after @entity5 sealed the door and gates			2
the family are currently staying at @entity70 ’s parents nearby as dehumidifiers dry out out their home			0
mr @entity5 added : ' hopefully the damage wo n’t be too bad			2
i would never have thought of the plasticine before but it was a great idea , it certainly helped			0
