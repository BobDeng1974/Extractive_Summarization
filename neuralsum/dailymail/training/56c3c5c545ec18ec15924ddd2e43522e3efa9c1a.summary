‘ if i had n’t fallen pregnant the brain tumours would have carried on growing , ' said @entity3 recovering in hospital the day after giving birth to her daughter , @entity3 was suddenly crippled by an excruciating headache			1
‘ i ’ve never known pain like it , ’ says the 43 - year - old former beauty therapy tutor from @entity10 , @entity11			1
‘ it was in my eyeballs and eye sockets			0
' i could n’t stop trembling — i could n’t even hold my baby , @entity17			0
’ at first , @entity3 put her symptoms down to side - effects from the @entity22 anaesthetic			1
but four days after the birth , in september 2009 , the left side of her face was paralysed , too			2
@entity3 ’s gp diagnosed @entity29 ’s palsy , where the facial nerve becomes inflamed after a viral infection , and prescribed steroids			1
two weeks later , the paralysis had gone , but the pain had returned			2
‘ i had toothache , headaches , eye ache , ’ says @entity3 , who is married to @entity35 , 45 , a pipe fitter			1
‘ i was exhausted and could barely look after @entity17			0
then i began losing the sight in my left eye			0
’ @entity3 was referred for ct scans , which revealed two brain tumours — one so huge it stretched from behind her left ear to the bottom of her jaw and then down her spine			1
‘ a hospital oncologist later said it was like an octopus wrapped around everything — it was the largest brain tumour he ’d seen , ’ says @entity3			1
the second tumour was smaller and on the right - hand side of her face			0
doctors believe the tumours had been there for ten years and hormones produced during @entity3 ’s pregnancy with @entity17 had caused them to grow aggressively , pressing on nerves that resulted in her symptoms			1
‘ if i had n’t fallen pregnant the brain tumours would have carried on growing , but much more slowly until it was too late , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ @entity17 saved my life			0
’ @entity3 is one of the 14,000 @entity71 diagnosed with brain tumours every year			1
the recent case of @entity74 , the five - year - old whose parents were arrested in @entity76 after removing him from @entity77 , has thrown a spotlight on this @entity80 cancer			2
the @entity81 wanted their son to undergo proton beam therapy , a more sophisticated form of radiotherapy			0
however , the @entity86 will not always fund the treatment for brain tumours and even if it does , patients have to travel overseas to get it			1
‘ i ’ve never known pain like it , ’ she said nine people die from brain tumours every day in @entity102 and @entity103 — they are the biggest cancer killer of children and under - 40s in @entity71			1
yet brain tumours receive 1 per cent of the money spent on cancer research			1
a report from @entity110 found that while half of patients diagnosed with all types of cancer survive for at least ten years , this drops to 13 per cent for brain tumour patients			1
indeed , survival rates for brain cancer increased by only 7 per cent between 1970 and 2014 , while the majority of other cancer survival rates soared			2
part of the problem is that it can take months , even years , to be diagnosed because many gps are poorly informed about brain cancer , says @entity124 , chief executive of the charity @entity125			1
‘ the speed and quality of brain tumour diagnosis is patchy across the country			2
this is a reflection of the lack of investment and awareness about this disease			0
‘ diagnosis is often delayed because gps and @entity137 teams may not request scans early enough or scans showing abnormalities may not be referred promptly to a specialist neuroscience team			2
’ ' i could n’t stop trembling — i could n’t even hold my baby , @entity17 , ' said @entity3 and many symptoms , such as headaches , nausea , vomiting and difficulty in walking , can be attributed to other causes , such as migraines or stress			1
furthermore , as there are more than 120 different types of brain tumours , their location and behaviour mean symptoms can vary , as can treatment			1
the number of sufferers may be nearly three times as high as the statistics indicate , says @entity164 , who leads the @entity125 flagship centre at the @entity166			0
‘ until recently , statistics included only those with primary brain tumours — those originating in the tissue of the brain			1
' however , there are other types of brain tumour			2
’ these include secondary cancers from other parts of the body spreading to the brain , tumours growing on the brain membrane and those growing on the cranial nerve			1
‘ if these are taken into account , 14,000 cases a year becomes more like 40,000			1
’ and unusually , compared with other cancers , cases are increasing			0
in 2012 , there were 23 per cent more men diagnosed as suffering from brain tumours than in 1970 and 25 per cent more women			1
one explanation is better diagnosis , thanks to increased awareness and improved diagnostic tools , says professor @entity164			0
lifestyle factors — such as mobile phone use , chemicals and exposure to radiation — could be contributing factors			0
the largest number of brain tumours in adults are due to secondary cancers spreading to the brain via the bloodstream — particularly from breast , lung and skin cancers ( the structure of these cancer cells enables them to stick to the blood vessels in the brain in a way other cancer cells do not )			1
‘ i had to learn to walk again and it affected my speech			0
my husband @entity35 had to wash and feed me			0
in the end , things were so bad i had to live with my mother - in - law for four months , ' said @entity3 between 20 and 40 per cent of all cancers spread to the brain , says @entity228 , consultant neurosurgeon at @entity229			1
treatment options include surgery ( location and tumour type permitting ) , radiotherapy and chemotherapy			0
@entity237 beam therapy is a more targeted form of radiotherapy and is thought to be less harmful to healthy brain tissue , though some experts question this			2
meanwhile , some chemotherapy drugs are ‘ no use ’ in brain tumours ‘ because the blood / brain barrier that prevents toxins reaching the brain stops some drugs getting through , ’ says dr @entity228			1
blood vessels are more tightly packed together in the brain , and are bound by proteins and special cells , meaning only fat - soluble substances ( most chemotherapy drugs are water - soluble ) get through			2
thanks to fundraising and sponsorship , £ 20 million is to be invested in new centres for brain cancer research : two in @entity261 — at @entity262 and @entity263 — and one in @entity265			2
‘ i still get a lot of pain in my head , eyes and teeth , ’ said @entity3 @entity3 ’s tumours were found to be a meningioma , a relatively common tumour originating in the meninges , the membranes surrounding the brain			1
it can usually be removed with surgery as it rarely penetrates brain tissue			2
however , the largest tumour had grown aggressively , fuelled by pregnancy hormones			0
its size and the fact it had grown around delicate brain structures and important blood vessels made it difficult to fully remove without risking brain injury or paralysis			2
in march 2010 , @entity3 underwent surgery to remove 30 per cent of the largest tumour — the part surrounding her left eye — followed by radiotherapy			1
‘ i was told there was a chance i would n’t survive surgery or i ’d be paralysed afterwards , ’ says @entity3			2
fortunately , she was unscathed			0
however , she says : ‘ i went through hell			0
’ ‘ i had to learn to walk again and it affected my speech			0
my husband @entity35 had to wash and feed me			0
' in the end , things were so bad i had to live with my mother - in - law for four months , so she could look after me and the baby as @entity35 had to work			0
’ the sight in her left eye could not be saved , because the tumour had damaged the optic nerve			0
‘ i still get a lot of pain in my head , eyes and teeth , ’ says @entity3 , who has mri scans every eight months and is too exhausted to return to work			1
‘ i ’m weak and need to sleep several hours a day			0
i need a childminder to help look after @entity17			0
’ the tumours have stopped growing ( the smaller one did not require surgery ) , but she may need another operation if that changes			0
‘ despite it all , i ’m hugely positive — and you never know what scientific breakthroughs may be around the corner			0
