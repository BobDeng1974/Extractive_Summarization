@entity13 does n’t quite comprehend any more			1
‘ but she does tend to smile			0
she liked the little picture of us on the back cover but she does n’t understand the wording			0
every story i ’ve written i read to her before i even did anything with it			0
’ ' it ’s the complete kaleidoscope of our life , from when we first got together to today ' @entity7 the couple married at @entity25 in 1968 and lived in @entity8 all their married life apart from a short spell in nearby @entity86			1

‘ the best poem in the book is the one i wrote when our first child was born , one of life ’s most precious moments , ’ he added			2
‘ it describes the thrill of holding your baby for the first time , something that many people can relate to			0
’ it ’s life ’s most precious moment between a man and his wife , when they are together and produce their first new life			1
it often starts when he ’s asleep at 3am or so , she wakes her weary partner and says ‘ it ’s time to go			0
’ her bag is packed and ready ; they ’ve rehearsed it all before			0
there ’s no need to panic , but he does that ’s for sure ! a quick drive to the hospital , there wo n’t be long to wait , if only he could keep awake it really would be great			0
everything is ready , no need to induce ; contractions getting regular , she ’s ready to produce			0
suffering hours of labour she screams out in pain , ‘ i ’ll never let you put me through all this again			0
’ you hold her hand so tightly but she grips you like a vice			0
@entity136 is called for , oh @entity138 it is n’t nice			0
but now you hold your baby , you and proud mum there , it is life ’s most precious moment , each of you can share			2
life of @entity67 by @entity7 was published in paperback on may 27			1
it is available on @entity150 for £ 4.73 , or for £ 1.83 on @entity151 the time has come to draw a close to the poems i ’ve written for you , our truly wonderful lifetime of love is very nearly through			2
after i wrote the last one i found it hard to understand my life received a nasty shock when fate called and took a hand			2
you were diagnosed with @entity15 ’s , a disease so cruel and sad it drove a wedge between our love and all the fun we ’d had			1
well over a thousand words i ’ve penned especially for you , i ’d gladly write a thousand more if you ’d understand a few but your powers of observation and the precious gift of speech both have sadly left you and are now well out of reach			2
you ’re living in a silent world with normal feelings gone and yet you ’re never giving up , you just keep struggling on			0
i see you every single day though you ’re in full time care i cry myself to sleep each night because you ’re never there			0
i ’m not looking for your sympathy for me or for my wife we ’ve both been very lucky in a long and happy life , some people have no life at all or are cut down in their prime victims of an accident or a cruel and hideous crime so when the curtain closes and the call comes from above i pray we ’ll be together to share another lifetime of true love .			1
