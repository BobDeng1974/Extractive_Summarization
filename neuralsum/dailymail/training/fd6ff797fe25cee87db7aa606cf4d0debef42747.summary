' they would see this as a declaration of war by @entity3			1
' with those words , one of the country 's best military minds has said what the politicians have been careful to avoid saying			1
professor @entity11 is one of @entity3 's pre-eminent voices on military intelligence and he says the militant fighters in @entity15 and @entity16 who saw the @entity17 as a direct enemy to attack , ' now see us as the enemy too '			1
' they ( @entity23 militants ) will see this as a declaration of war by @entity3 ' professor @entity11			1
' they now see us as the enemy , just as they have the @entity17 ' in announcing the deployment of 600 defence personnel to the @entity30 , the prime minister warned the operation could take ' many months ' he has also cast serious doubt on the involvement of the air force			1
' we must remember that these terrorists are not easily visible , in fact they are embedded within the towns and villages and amongst civilians , ' professor @entity11 said			1
' i am not sure what we are doing there with fa - 18s , the targets are very small			0
you ca n't bomb them so i do n't see how they can mount air strikes effectively			2
' prime minister @entity50 and attorney - general @entity51 have been at pains to emphasise that @entity3 will be part of an international coalition and the deployment does not mean @entity3 was at war nor will there be combat troops on the ground			1
the pm says the measure of success is ' if @entity62 is dislodged , if the @entity15 government is once again reasonably capable of maintaining control of its own territory maintaining internal security ' ' if @entity62 is dislodged , if the @entity15 government is once again reasonably capable of maintaining control of its own territory maintaining internal security , that will certainly be a success , ' mr @entity50 said			1
' you may well see the air element leave by the end of the week and some of the special forces may well leave before then			2
' it 's believed the elite @entity78 members could be on their way as early as wednesday			1
but according to senator @entity51 the decision is simply to ' pre-position @entity3 forces in the @entity82 in the event that @entity3 decides to commit to a multi-national , essentially humanitarian force , to deal with the @entity62 insurgency in northern @entity15 '			1
' we are involved in war - like operations			2
if we are not careful we could still be doing this in 10 years time			0
we need a clearly defined mission , go in , achieve it and then get out , ' says @entity92 mp @entity91 independent mp @entity91 says ' these are semantics really , we are involved in war - like operations '			2
' we helped start a war 11 and a half years ago based on a litany of lies			0
we started a war which continues to this day , so what in fact what we are dealing with today is in part our own making			0
' they ( @entity105 ) are wanting to draw us into this war			0
. and we are being drawn in			0
we have to be very mindful of mission creep , if we are not careful we could still be doing this in 10 years time			0
' we need a clearly defined mission , go in , achieve it and then get out , ' mr @entity91 said			0
senator @entity51 ( left ) says the decision taken by @entity111 was to ' pre-position @entity3 forces in the @entity82 in the event that @entity3 decides to commit to a multi-national , essentially humanitarian force , to deal with the @entity62 insurgency in northern @entity15 '			1
professor @entity11 ( right ) claims ' this is alliance politics on our behalf ' prof @entity11 thinks there is little chance @entity3 combat troops will be required , even if the operation is drawn out			1
' we will train and advise , like we 've done previously in @entity15 , ' he added			2
' this is alliance politics on our behalf			0
' but , equally , he is not confident a successful mission against the @entity23 terrorists if the ground battle is left to local military forces			2
' if you really wanted to effectively deal with the terror threat you would have to deal with the @entity133 regime in @entity16 and lean on both @entity134 and @entity135 - and the @entity17 is not going to do that			1
' further , he said , was the @entity15 national army ' is n't worth much at all and is not motivated '			2
' on the other hand , the @entity140 fighters are very motivated but not very capable			0
' prof @entity11 has been at the helm of terrorism and national security courses since leaving defence more than a decade ago			1
of greater concern , he says , is the impact @entity3 's decision to commit military forces to @entity15 has had in @entity150			1
not very confident of success			0
professor @entity11 says bombing the so - called islamic state terror group is not an option and local forces are not strong enough or capable of forcing the militants out ' terrorism specialists there have made it clear that the chatter in @entity150 has now turned to attacking westerners , ' prof @entity11 added			1
the islamic state terror groups grew out of @entity62 ' which we never effectively dealt with , we never hit them with the killer punch '			0
latest figures have those working with @entity105 numbering 31,000 across @entity16 and northern @entity15			2
militants aligned to the so - called @entity23 group march through a town in @entity16 a pro-isil fighter pictured in the city of @entity171 in northern @entity15 ' it 's now attracting a lot more people			1
2000 have pledged there allegiance in recent days across @entity150			1
' intelligence shows that just six months ago these groups ( in @entity16 and @entity15 ) numbered about 12,000 , so support has grown considerably , ' he said			2
mr @entity91 says we are now facing increased terrorist threats because of this decision			0
' every time we interfere in the @entity30 we become more of a target , ' he said			0
' clearly we are pre-positioning for what is coming next			0
' 600 @entity3 defence personnel will be sent to the @entity82 ahead of likely deployment into @entity15 as part of a multi-national operation against ' @entity23 ' militants unlike other missions , the @entity192 has promised there will be ' no combat troops ' on the ground in @entity15 but @entity78 troops are believed to be preparing to leave , perhaps as early as wednesday the @entity198 has called on the government to reveal its forward plans			1
' clearly they had ( made decisions ) some weeks ago and they made announcements now , ' he said			0
' they are now saying we are only pre-positioning , that 's exactly what they said 11 and a half years ago , we were only pre-positioning and no decisions had been made about going to war			2
' we are doing what the enemy would like us to do			0
we must have a very clearly defined mission , apply the resources needed to achieve that mission and then get out			0
' ' this is a problem for the world and that is why we in @entity3 are engaged , we need to be engaged , it affects particularly the western world , ' senator @entity51 said			0
as @entity3 prepares to deploy its forces , it 's expected new counter-terror laws will be tabled in parliament , perhaps as early next week			1
they will all but prohibit travel to countries like @entity16 and @entity15 , which are areas now designated as terrorism hubs .			0

professor @entity11 is one of @entity3 's leading military *analysts*
he says in the militants eyes , ' @entity3 has declared war '
doubts the need for involvement of @entity238 and effectiveness of air - strikes because the ' terrorists are embedded with villagers '
warns that up to 2000 is *sympathisers* in @entity150 have pledged allegiance to the group pm @entity50 refers to as a ' death cult '
