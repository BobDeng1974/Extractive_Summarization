by @entity0 for celebrities like @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 a jet - set lifestyle can make it tough to stay fresh - faced			1
the latest fashionable answer ? iv drips			1
@entity3 , @entity5 and @entity9 have all posted photographs of themselves on iv drips when their non-stop schedules have left them rundown			1
@entity3 admitted she sought treatment to help with a cold and @entity9 conceded that her hectic travel schedule was catching up with her			2
@entity17 vitamin drips will be available in the @entity18 from september			2
hydration treatments will be priced at £ 199 and @entity20 £ 39 but such quick fixes have n't been available to the rest of us , at least in the @entity18 , until now			1
from september these boosts will be available up and down the country with @entity26 offering @entity28 treatments at £ 199 and @entity20 for £ 39			1
the treatments aim to help you look and feel your best			1
they deliver vitamins and ' wellness ' agents quickly and efficiently – claiming to give you 100 % of the benefits compared to 55 % you get from tablets			2
ceo @entity36 says the treatments are filling a huge gap in the market			1
‘ a lot of people do n’t need to see a doctor but they are also not feeling 100 %			2
they 'd normally go to a doctor or to buy painkillers and medicines at a pharmacy			2
these treatments help them get back to feeling their best again and cut out the middle man			1
’ celebrity fans : @entity9 posted this image of her having an iv drip on her @entity51 account in may @entity52 joined the celebrity trend in june @entity54 posted her iv drip picture just before filming her latest video in march ( left ) and @entity5 is a veteran to the trend posting her pic way back in june 2012 ( right ) @entity59 vice president of operations at @entity17 says getting one of the shots in @entity62 changed her life and motivated her to set up the business			1
‘ i just kept thinking , when can i get this again and how ? i was travelling all the time and exhausted			2
my life changed that day			2
' on the menu for @entity18 customers will be a choice of five @entity72 options and three booster shots			1
the @entity75 , favoured by athletes , delivers 2 to 4 litres of saline to aid peak hydration ; @entity78 , a recovery infusion to ward of pain and nausea – i.e a hangover or jet lag ; vitaglow an anti-ageing infusion and @entity86 , a deluxe treatment combining @entity88 and @entity89			1
the shots are @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , which claims to rev up the metabolism and aid weight loss of up to 4lb in a week alongside healthy eating and exercise			1
there 's a sense of excitement amongst my fellow guinea pigs ( including @entity104 's @entity103 ) as we prepare for our ivs			0
we 've heard whispers of the wondrous benefits – lose weight , boost immunity , cure a hangover , overcome jet lag			1
some claim the drips have banished all illness for more than a year – others say friends got pregnant soon after having one			2
writer @entity119 tries the celebrity the @entity17 drip for @entity122			0
the drips work by delivering vitamins and ' wellness ' agents quickly and efficiently so i 'm excited			0
leading up to this i 've worked and partied a little too hard			0
unrelated , i 've also been diagnosed with @entity129 , a painful chest condition			0
@entity131 's in the grip of a sweltering , sleep - preventing heatwave			0
i 'm probably even feeling a tiny bit like @entity5 , @entity135 and @entity9 do			1
on the table in front of me lie my potential saviours			0
a selection consisting of five @entity72 options and three booster shots			1
i 'm advised to go for the @entity143 infusion that contains b vitamins , anti-ageing glutathione and an energy booster			2
i 've never been on a drip before			0
tellingly , i 've told my mother nothing about this as it would only have worried her			0
but i 'm reassured by @entity26 's medical approach ( they have four physicians on the board )			0
these days in @entity162 , ‘ party buses ' offer ivs to revellers in need of a quick fix			0
@entity26 is nothing like this			0
i have a consultation with ceo @entity36 who takes me through a detailed health @entity166 still feel slightly nauseous as my skin is pricked and then it 's in			0
it 's at this point i learn that i have small veins – so rather than taking 30 minutes for the goodness to filter into my blood stream ( the average time ) , it takes an hour , pretty unusual			1
it feels cool – as in cold , not because i feel like @entity5 although that probably helps - because the fluid is below body temperature			1
i 'd arrived with a headache , which disappears about half way through			0
when it ends i 'm left feeling very clear - headed , the way you feel when you 've put in brand new contact lenses with a new , sharper prescription			0
i feel , in essence , very alert			0
fans at the launch talked about the iv drip 's benefits lasting for days – weeks – months even			1
about it helping them stay healthy and ward off colds and flu			0
i 'm hoping it will see me through another tough week of work , and perhaps i 'll learn my lesson about partying too hard			0
although miracles were never what @entity26 promised			0
