and consumers are telling us between the two , they prefer sugar , ' @entity5 said			0
under review : take 5 , @entity21 , @entity22 and a @entity23 are examples of @entity0 's products that use corn syrup a switch to sugar would make @entity0 a high - profile example of the move away from high - fructose corn syrup in the food industry			1
many people say they avoid it because it has gained a bad reputation for fueling weight gain and diabetes , though health experts says there 's not enough evidence to conclude it 's any worse than regular sugar			0
in an emailed statement , @entity0 said its work on ' exploring ' the replacement of high - fructose corn syrup ' is just under way ' and that it did not have a timeframe on when it might be complete			1
