researchers from the @entity1 are conducting a world - first study on newborn babies to investigate whether it is possible to predict whether a child will stutter even before they can talk			1
@entity1 's @entity8 are conducting the study in an attempt to discover the cause of stuttering , using 20 babies with a family history of the disorder and 20 without			1
17 - week old @entity16 was the first baby to take part in the study , after his older sister @entity19 suffered from a debilitating stutter from the time she was two years old			1
17 - week old @entity16 was the first baby to take part in the study on the causes of stuttering ' it got to the point where she refused to speak , she would just point at things , ' said @entity16 's mother , @entity29			1
' she was shy and withdrawn and frustrated , and she did n't want to speak to anyone her age because they could n't understand her , ' @entity29 told @entity33			2
' we did n't want that for @entity16 , it 's just such a formative time and we did n't want him to be disabled by a stutter , so we agreed to be part of the study , ' she said			1
@entity16 underwent the first of many mri scans , which will continue over the next six years , just two days ago , under the watchful eye of his mother and researchers at the @entity8			1
' it 's very hard to scan babies because you ca n't exactly tell a baby to sit still , you have to wait for them to fall asleep , and even then the loud noises from the machine might wake them up , ' @entity29 said			1
the researchers will scan the newborns in an mri machine in order to detect transmission issues in the parts of the brain which relate to speech			2
@entity16 's older sister @entity19 ( left ) developed a stutter when she was just two years old @entity16 underwent his first scan on the 27th of january , watched by his mother @entity63 ( far right ) the study will scan 40 babies over a six - year period to gain information about the causes of stuttering director of the @entity8 , professor @entity70 , said that the study could revolutionise both diagnosis and treatment of the disorder			1
' it will take us a step closer to understanding the cause of stuttering and could potentially lead us to discover more effective early - intervention treatments , ' said professor @entity70			2
' this would be a huge breakthrough as stuttering is only noticeable when a child starts stringing words together at two to three - years - of - age and the current window for effective treatment is so small			2
' stuttering has been reported to affect one in nine children by the age of four , and approximately 70 % of those diagnosed have a family history of stuttering			2
@entity29 said that not only did her daughter develop a stutter , but her father also had the condition			0
' we 're a bilingual family as well , and there is a link between that and stuttering , so really it was a double whammy for us , ' she said			0
director of the @entity8 , professor @entity70 ( above ) , said that the study could revolutionise both diagnosis and treatment of the disorder stuttering has been reported to affect one in nine children by the age of four , and approximately 70 % of those diagnosed have a family history of stuttering @entity16 's brain will continue to be monitored through regular mri scans , in order to provide early information on what the causes of stuttering could be			1
' considering the advancements in medicine , it shocked me that so little was known about the causes of stuttering , ' said @entity29			0
@entity125 , associate professor at the @entity126 , said that it was not clear whether stuttering was a cause or an effect of problems with the transmission of information along fibres of the brain			0
' we currently do nâ€™t know if the structural problems we see in the brain are present prior to the onset of stuttering , or result from stuttering , ' said associate professor @entity125			0
' this is because previous studies have only examined the brains of older children and adults who have already developed a stutter , ' he said			0
@entity29 said that she was keen to do anything to help aid the research process			0
' after we took @entity19 in for treatment , she improved dramatically within three months , and now you would n't be able to tell , ' she said			0
@entity29 said the study would be important to provide information early to start treating the issue before it became permanent			0
' the study will provide a lot of information , and this is the next step in the process , ' she said			0
@entity16 's brain will continue to be monitored through regular mri scans ' we did n't want him to be disabled by a stutter , so we agreed to be part of the study , ' @entity29 said			1

@entity16 is the first baby to take part in a study on stuttering
his *grandfather* and older sister both suffered from stuttering
his mother said that she did n't want him to go through the trauma
the study is being conducted by the @entity1
newborn babies will undergo mri scans over six years
researchers are *hoping* to discover the causes of stuttering
