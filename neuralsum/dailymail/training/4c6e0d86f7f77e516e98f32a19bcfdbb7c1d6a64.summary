by @entity0 almost every morning , @entity1 turned up at court arm - in - arm with his family			1
but behind the show of unity , his wife @entity4 and daughter @entity4 knew , better than anyone , that his near - saintly public image bore little resemblance to the real @entity1			1
devoted husband ? he had an affair with his live - in housekeeper - cum - chauffeur back in the @entity15 , which had left @entity4 ‘ devastated ’ , it emerged during the trial			1
@entity1 had told @entity4 that the ‘ relationship ’ started when the girl was 18 , not 13			1
when she went into the witness stand to give evidence for him , @entity4 told the court she believed him			1
but what daughter would want to believe their own father was guilty not just of adultery with her best friend , but of something much worse as well ? so @entity4 - and her mother - stood by him			1
from the very start , though , the daily show of ‘ family unity ’ looked suspiciously choreographed			1
under cross examination , the jury learnt that the limousine bringing @entity1 and his wife to court stopped en route at a local cafe each day to pick up @entity4 , so they could all arrive together			1
it was all for the benefit of the assembled tv crews and photographers			0
proof , maybe , that the camera does sometimes lie			0
@entity1 ’s complex relationship with his wife and daughter , and their sometimes unconventional behaviour , was the sub-plot to the case			1
@entity4 , 82 , a sculptress and jewellery - maker in her heyday , sat in the public gallery with other members of the family , just yards from her husband			1
she had to listen as his reputation - and , by implication , their 56 - year marriage - was dismantled allegation by allegation			2
deceived : @entity1 pictured with his daughter @entity4 after one especially harrowing day of evidence , she allowed him to step straight from the dock and kiss her on the lips			1
only once did @entity4 show any visible sign of emotion			1
when the jury was told about @entity1 ’s fling with the housekeeper , @entity4 appeared to wipe away a tear			1
her eccentric streak was apparent from the first day , when she brought a novelty cushion ( featuring the face of a gerbil - like creature wearing a crown ) to sit on			2
it was as if to say she was the same @entity4 who , in her younger days , chose her pet poodle to be a bridesmaid at her wedding			2
@entity99 — as she is now — was only allowed to take her place sitting near her mother in court once she had testified ( her mother did not give evidence )			0
during his summing up , the judge reminded the jury of the testimony of @entity108 ’ childhood friend by referring to the victim ’s statement : ‘ he hugged and tickled me			0
it was creepy ’ … ‘ he walked his fingers up my back ’ … ‘ his hand went inside the towel ’ … ‘ he spat on his fingers ’ [ before indecently assaulting the girl ]			0
from 50 - year - old mrs @entity108 , herself an artist , there was not the slightest reaction ; not a shake of the head nor the hint of an anguished expression			0
she looked like a disinterested spectator , constantly fiddling with her mobile phone on her lap. indeed , there were times during the trial when mrs @entity108 appeared to be trying too hard to act normally			0
quirky bride : @entity1 and his wife @entity4 - with her pet poodle as ' bridesmaid ' - are pictured in march 1958 once , she wore a bright red flower in her hair ; on another occasion , an almost fluorescent yellow scarf with black polka dots			1
before she gave evidence , she could often be found in the canteen with her headphones on			0
during breaks in the proceedings , @entity1 became a ‘ father ’ and ‘ husband ’ again , joining his wife , daughter , other relatives and his agent in the waiting room outside @entity158 , or in the canteen			1
at least two private security guards hovered in the background			0
@entity4 and @entity163 have always shunned the limelight , so the past few weeks must have been particularly painful			2
in one way or another , though , they have been victims of @entity1 ’s stardom all their lives			2
her husband ’s non-stop work schedule left @entity4 desperately lonely , particularly during the early years of their marriage , prompting her to confide in her diary : ‘ i feel like killing myself , i ’m so bored			1
’ in his 2001 autobiography , @entity1 says he only discovered how unhappy she was when , many years later , he found her old diary			2
‘ i had been so absorbed in my own career … that i had totally forgotten about @entity4			2
i am crying inside now as i write this			0
’ he recalled how he ’d boarded a plane to go on a tour of the @entity181 within a few hours of @entity4 ’s birth : ‘ right up until the last minute , @entity4 expected me to cancel , ’ he admitted			2
@entity1 leaves @entity183 , with his wife @entity4 , left , and daughter @entity4 , right we now know that his failings went much deeper than merely putting his career first			1
even so , his celebrity and long absences had a devastating effect on his daughter			0
in a rare interview more than a decade ago , mrs @entity108 spoke about being desperately lonely as a child when her father was away			0
‘ i would be sitting on people ’s doorsteps saying : “ can i play with you ? ” and , until recently , had never even displayed a picture of him in the house because of the inevitable reaction from visitors			0
‘ the conversation would go straight to my father and i ’d think : “ oh , no , not again			0
” ’ mrs @entity108 , who has an 18 - year - old son from a previous relationship , now lives in north @entity207 with her husband , @entity208			0
when she gave evidence , she said she was still having counselling to deal with the legacy of her relationship with her father			0
‘ it is really difficult having to be the daughter of a famous man , having to be the single child and dealing with that all on your own , ’ she said			0
she said she had come to terms with his ‘ affair ’ with her best friend after finding out about it from the girl herself in 1997			2
but that was when she — and her mother — thought the relationship began when her friend was a young woman , not still a child .			0
