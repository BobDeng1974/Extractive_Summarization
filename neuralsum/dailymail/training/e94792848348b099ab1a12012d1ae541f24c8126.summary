@entity1 star @entity0 has become embroiled in a row with the mayor of @entity4 over plans to sell off a piece of land to make way for a housing development			1
@entity4 - born @entity0 , 58 , who played @entity10 in the hit tv series , voiced her support for the @entity14 campaign as she visited her home city to pick up a magazine award			1
she described the park , which is situated in the @entity19 area of the city , as a ' refuge ' during her childhood years and said proposals to turn it into a housing development were ' very sad '			1
@entity0 , 58 , who played @entity10 in hit tv series @entity1 , was criticised by the mayor of @entity4 , @entity28 , for voicing her support for the @entity14 campaign ( pictured ) @entity4 mayor , @entity29 councillor @entity28 ( pictured ) , said @entity0 's comments were ' ill - informed ' however , @entity4 mayor , @entity29 councillor @entity28 , blasted her comments as ' ill - informed ' and ' out of context ' and questioned : ' what does she really know of the issues that @entity4 faces ?			1
' the row started earlier this week when @entity0 , who is now predominantly based in @entity38 , expressed her disappointed over the plans to build on the 11 acres of land			1
she told the @entity41 : ' i love @entity43			0
i was lucky enough to grow up playing there			0
' @entity43 was a refuge for my mother during her childhood years , it was dickensian really because her father disappeared and she did n't have much so @entity43 represented every holiday that she ever had			2
' so it 's very sad what 's going on right now with the meadows , and i feel that my involvement with that , it feels from my mum as well			2
i first told her about it and she said " that 's just not right , this is the people 's land " and i believe that as well			0
' visiting the park on saturday , she added : ' it 's so pastoral , it 's so beautiful and it gives people a place to contemplate and play and walk and we need that barrier between the houses and the park			2
' however , mr @entity28 hit out at her comments , saying ' it 's all very well for a @entity73 superstar to shout from the sidelines '			2
he said : ' she may have played in @entity43 when she briefly lived in the city as a girl , but she left			0
' i am still here and having to deal with massive and savage @entity79 government cuts to our budget while devising ways to grow and sustain the city and protect its most vulnerable citizens			0
@entity0 expressed her desire for the 11 acre piece of land to remain untouched during her current visit to her home city			1
although based in @entity38 , she returned to collect an award at the city 's @entity91 ( pictured ) @entity0 appears to have had the last word after taking to her @entity95 page to condemn the mayor 's retaliation ' i 'd be interested to hear what @entity0 has to say on care packages for the elderly and disabled adults , mental health provision , crumbling schools or repairing our roads , for example			1
' her comments are totally out of context and ill - informed			1
the fact is that since i became mayor we have created more green space and there is more of it now than at any time in @entity4 's history			1
' we 're selling off 5.5 acres on @entity115			0
it 's adjacent to , but not in , the 300 acres of @entity43 in which people , as she suggests , can walk , play and contemplate			0
' we 're putting in 28 houses , of which 15 are villas , and 24 apartments and the money we get from that will be invested in our city and our parks			0
' however , the row did n't end there and @entity0 fired back to mr @entity28 via her @entity95 account that his calculations on the number of houses to be built were n't correct			1
she wrote : ' @ least i can count , @entity28			2
it 's 55 dwellings , mate			0
has he even seen @entity140 's published plans ?			0
' she later told her followers she had a ' right to my opinion '			0
@entity0 appeared in @entity1 alongside @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 ( above )			2
