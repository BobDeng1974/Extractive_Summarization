short people are up to 50 per cent more likely to die from dementia than the tallest , it is claimed			2
and men are most at risk , according to a study			0
being short does not cause dementia , say the experts , but it may be a marker for poor nutrition in childhood or other early life factors that affect growth			1
file picture such factors are already linked to a higher risk of heart disease among shorter people			0
‘ we found shorter adult height was associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia death and that this association was stronger in men , ’ said dr @entity22 , who led the study			1
researchers from the @entity31 at @entity32 analysed data from 18 studies involving almost 182,000 people between 1994 and 2008			0
the height of participants was measured and other information , including social status and health history , collected			0
of 17,553 deaths during an average follow - up period of ten years , 1,093 were from dementia			0
the study found the risk of dying from dementia was 50 per cent higher among the shortest men compared with the tallest			1
for every 2.87in decrease in height from the average 5ft 6ins for men , a person was 26 per cent more likely to die from the condition among women , the risk of dying from dementia was 35 per cent higher among the shortest			1
there was a 13 per cent increase in risk for each 2.5in reduction in height there was a 24 per cent increase in risk for every three inches of reduced height among those in the studies			1
among women , the risk of dying from dementia was 35 per cent higher among the shortest			2
there was a 13 per cent increase in risk for each 2.5in reduction in height			1
dr @entity22 , of the @entity32 ’s @entity71 , said it was the biggest study of its type			0
senior author , dr @entity75 , of the @entity76 at @entity77 , added : ‘ short height in itself of course does not “ cause ” dementia			0
rather , height captures a number of early life factors , including early - life illness , adversity , poor nutrition , and psychosocial stress , and so allows us to examine the effect of these on dementia more closely			1
’ @entity93 , professor of human genetics , @entity95 , said : ‘ the authors are not claiming that height directly alters risk of dementia			2
they are claiming something more subtle and less controversial – that height is a marker of early life factors which predict death from dementia			0

being *vertically* *challenged* increases risk of dementia in men and women
*scientists* at @entity32 found results more pronounced for men
*findings* show lack of inches does not cause dementia
but it could be an *indicator* of poor nutrition , stress or other hardships
for every 2.87in decrease in height from the average 5ft 6ins for men , a person was 26 per cent more likely to die from the condition
for women a *2.68in* drop from the average height of 5ft 3ins was linked to a 10 per cent increase in dementia *mortality* risk
