classical musician : @entity1 was told her 11 - week - old daughter @entity2 was not allowed in @entity4 's @entity3 and was forced to breastfeed her in a parked car outside the premises a classical musician was banned from taking her newborn baby into a private members club - and had to breastfeed her outside in a car			1
cellist @entity1 , 34 , is breastfeeding her 11 - week - old daughter @entity11			1
she had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played @entity16 ’s @entity15 in g major at the exclusive @entity3			1
but she was told the baby was not allowed into the central @entity4 venue because it would be against a by - law which prohibits anyone under the age of 12 from entering			1
instead , the babysitter had to wait outside the venue with @entity11 and @entity25 had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby			1
the classical cello player breastfed her youngster in a parked car outside the premises , and when she returned to the venue to take to the stage , the babysitter walked around a nearby @entity36 store with @entity2			1
miss @entity1 told the @entity37 : ‘ i ’d already arranged a second babysitter to be at home with my four - year - old son as i ’m fully aware that it is often inappropriate to take children to such events			1
‘ does this really apply to a breastfed 11 - week - old babe in arms ? i found the way they handled the whole situation very upsetting , insensitive and quite frankly rude			2
’ playing in a small ensemble , she has been unable to take maternity leave			2
because her daughter is only breastfed , she has to travel with her mother			2
miss @entity1 said her dressing room was two floors below the bar and dining area where her group - the @entity58 - were performing			1
there was no chance of any of the club members - who pay an annual membership fee of up to £ 1,000 - being disturbed by her baby			1
she told @entity72 : ‘ i have been advised the club is in the wrong			2
even though it is a private members club it is not allowed to do that			2
it is not about legal action			0
‘ it is how upset i feel for my baby girl being sent into a freezing winter ’s night when there was a perfectly good dressing room where she could have stayed			1
it would have done no harm to let her in			0
’ group violinist @entity83 talked to the club management ‘ for hours ’ on the morning of the concert in an effort to resolve the issue			0
the exclusive club was founded nearly 200 years ago by returning officers and officials from @entity91 and the @entity92			2
the first members had to have a connection to that quarter of the globe and it was frequented by distinguished dignitaries , returning servicemen and civil servants , those who had ridden elephants and dined with @entity91 princes			0
the by - laws banning children from the venue are the club 's own regulations , which could be a breach of the law			1
the @entity108 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe , shop or public transport , unless it was deemed unsafe or there was a good reason why the premises was single - sex			1
last night no - one at the club was available for comment			2
‘ @entity123 ’ policy : the incident comes after mother - of - three @entity125 ( pictured ) , 35 , was recently asked to cover herself with a large napkin * ( right ) as she breastfed her baby at the five - star @entity131 ’s hotel in @entity132 controversy : @entity131 's said it ' embraces ' breastfeeding , but asks that women are ' discreet towards guests ' the incident last week comes after mother @entity125 , 35 , was recently asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in @entity142 ’s hotel			1
the mother of three was left humiliated after staff at the five - star @entity141 gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12 - week - old daughter @entity147 during afternoon tea			1
mrs @entity149 , who is married to comedy actor @entity150 , was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid ' causing offence ' , but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards			0
at the time , she said : ‘ i was really shocked as i had never experienced this before			0
through my tears i tried to explain that i was really quite cross			0
' she criticised the hotel ’s ‘ @entity123 ’ policy and the incident led to a mass breastfeeding protest outside the five - star @entity141			1
the demonstration , organised by @entity162 to feed - which campaigns for the ' normalising ' of public breastfeeding - saw dozens of mothers brave freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel 's grand front doors and feed their infants			1
@entity131 's has said it ' embraces ' breastfeeding , but requests that women are ' discreet towards other guests '			0
many travelled from as far away as @entity176 for the protest , which came after @entity179 leader @entity178 waded into the debate , by suggesting mothers of newborn babies should avoid being ' openly ostentatious ' when breastfeeding and think about sitting in a corner when doing so			0
he insisted it was ' not too difficult ' to feed a child in a way that was ' not openly ostentatious ' , and even defended the @entity132 hotel , saying that each establishment should be able to impose their own rules about when and where breastfeeding should be done			1
protest : a group of about 40 mothers took part in a demonstration outside @entity142 's following the incident demonstration : the mothers breastfed their babies after the hotel forced the mother to cover up with a napkin the @entity179 leader also suggested that many people feel ' very , very embarrassed ' when they see a child being breastfed			0
his comments sparked fury , with many @entity210 users suggesting that mr @entity178 himself should ' hide in the corner ' over his ' outrageous ' stance			0
@entity215 chief executive @entity214 also added that it was ' bemusing ' for anyone to think of breastfeeding as ' ostentatious '			0
but as the backlash over his comments grew , the outspoken mp attempted to play down the controversy by insisting he did not ' personally endorse ' women perhaps sitting in a corner			0
however , in a statement released through @entity210 to clarify his position , mr @entity178 still maintained it was up to each establishment to decide on their own rules			0
the latest controversy comes at a time when more women are being encouraged to breastfeed , with a new study suggesting that continuing to do so until babies are 18 months old could save the @entity235 £ 40million			0
opinion : @entity179 leader @entity178 ( above ) waded into the debate , by suggesting mothers of newborns should avoid being ' openly ostentatious ' when breastfeeding and maybe consider sitting in a corner when doing so the government argues that breastfeeding has ' huge health benefits for mother and baby ' , particularly vulnerable babies in neonatal and special care baby units			1
a report by a team of researchers led by @entity251 has suggested that the @entity235 could save millions by enoucraging women to breastfeed for longer , reducing common childhood illnesses and also cutting the risk of women developing breast cancer over their lifetime , which is said to be linked to low rates of breastfeeding			0
however , on its website , the @entity235 says : ' you should n't ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public			0
' in fact , the @entity108 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe , shop or public transport			0
' @entity271 has contacted the @entity3 for comment			1
according to the @entity108 of 2010 , it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding			0
however , in september a breastfeeding mother claimed that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast			0
@entity279 , a single 25 - year - old , was feeding her 11 - week - old son @entity280 at the @entity282 pub owned by @entity283 in @entity284 , @entity285 , when she was told to cover up			2
meanwhile , in august @entity286 , 29 , from @entity287 , @entity288 , was told by a lifeguard at @entity290 that she could not breastfeed her five - month - old daughter @entity291 because it was ' classed as eating and drinking '			1
in june , a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant			2
@entity300 , 27 , was left feeling ' embarrassed and ashamed ' after staff at @entity302 in @entity303 suggested she move while feeding her four - month - old son @entity304			0
ms @entity300 , who was lunching with a friend , was offered a spot by the restaurant 's toilets , which bosses at the restaurant say was more ' convenient ' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there			0
it comes after around 70 women descended on @entity316 in @entity317 in april to show support for 25 - year - old @entity319 , who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three - month - old son			2
she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of ' company policy '			2
the sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to @entity329 which had a baby and mother room .			1
