by @entity0 having travelled to @entity2 every year for more than a decade on family holidays , nurse @entity1 knew what precautions to take			1
her vaccinations were up to date and she had packed enough high - factor sunscreen to protect all of her extended family during their two - week trip			1
she also started taking daily anti-malarial medication before she left @entity11 to ensure she was protected			2
@entity1 's malaria pills stopped working after a stomach bug while in @entity2 despite her medical training , however , @entity1 , 37 , did not know that the 24 - hour stomach bug she picked up halfway through the holiday would render those doxycyline tablets useless			1
and the bug , although unpleasant , was not even that severe			1
' i had my birthday during the holiday and woke up feeling sick that day so skipped breakfast , but took my anti-malarial as usual and had just a cup of tea , ' says @entity1			1
' about an hour later i started vomiting and carried on being sick for the rest of the morning			2
' she was well enough to go out later for a birthday dinner with her husband @entity29 , 41 , and ten - year - old daughter @entity29 , joined by the rest of the family , although she did n't have much of an appetite			2
by the next day she was feeling better , but the damage had been done			2
within four days of returning home , @entity1 was in a resuscitation room in @entity37 , delirious and too weak even to stand			1
she had malaria , which can be deadly			1
just this weekend , 21 - year - old @entity11 aid worker @entity39 died in @entity40 after contracting the disease			2
she , too , had been taking anti-malarials			2
@entity1 had visited a wetland area known for its mosquitoes , but had n't even noticed the bite mark tests revealed @entity1 had falciparum malaria , the most severe form of the disease , and she was immediately taken to intensive care where she was put into an induced coma			1
at one point , @entity29 was warned his wife might not survive			2
@entity1 had visited a wetland area known for its mosquitoes , but had n't even noticed the bite mark from the insect			1
' because i 'd been taking my anti-malarials every day i never thought i could be at risk , ' she says			2
the problem with doxycycline and most other popular anti-malarials is that they have to be taken every day to keep enough levels in the blood to suppress malaria as it 's developing , explains dr @entity68 , senior lecturer at @entity69			1
' so a period of sickness or diarrhoea , even over just a day or two , could leave you less protected - and it takes a little while afterwards for the medication to return to optimum levels , ' he says			2
and it 's not just anti-malarials			2
the potency of any daily medicine , including those for long - standing conditions , can be affected by sickness and diarrhoea , says @entity83 , of the @entity84			2
' if you 've vomited within three hours of taking medication , its effect will be compromised , ' he says			0
' and if you 're on medication for cardiovascular or stroke - related conditions - to regulate heartbeat , control blood pressure or prevent blood clots , for instance - that could be life threatening			0
' often those on medication are unaware that they are , in effect , missing a dose if they have a stomach upset			1
' people think that once a pill is swallowed , the effect is immediate , ' says dr @entity108 , gp and medical director of the dr @entity112 online clinic			0
' vomiting or diarrhoea can effectively mean a missed dose and it can be critical - enough to throw some patients on medication for heart problems into heart failure			1
' dr @entity108 has known of patients on the blood - thinning drug @entity124 to suffer a blood clot because of a missed dose through an upset stomach			1
there are others at risk , too			0
for women taking the contraceptive ill , even a minor stomach upset can reduce its effectiveness and result in an unplanned pregnancy			1
with drugs that have a long - lasting effect , such as thyroxine for thyroid problems or medication for osteoporosis , a couple of days of sickness wo n't cause too much of a problem , according to mr @entity83			0
but , he warns : ' losing a day 's worth of epilepsy , asthmatic drugs ( excluding inhalers ) or those for mental health conditions such as schizophrenia can have serious consequences			0
' @entity153 can be more problematic than vomiting			0
the resulting dehydration and the effect this has on your levels of potassium and sodium ( electrolytes that help regulate fluid levels ) can also affect how drugs are absorbed , adds dr @entity108			0
' this can , for instance make digoxin , which regulates irregular heartbeat , ineffective			0
' so if you are on daily medication and have an upset stomach what should you do ? ' you should repeat the dose as soon as possible and seek medical advice if you are sick again within three hours of taking the replacement dose , ' advises mr @entity83			1
with diarrhoea you should also keep up your fluids and take rehydration sachets to replace lost electrolytes			0
and make sure you discuss a sick - day management plan before you even go away - again , with your pharmacist or gp			0
' everyone should know what to do in unforeseen circumstances - if they become ill with another condition that may affect their medication , they lose their drugs , their tablets get wet or , say , they 're on insulin which needs to be kept in a fridge , but there 's a blackout at their resort , ' says mr @entity83			0
@entity1 started to become seriously ill the day after she returned home to @entity198 , @entity199 , in november 2011			1
her symptoms began during her first night shift back at @entity202			0
' i felt freezing cold and so achy the next morning , that i went straight to bed when i came home and did n't have the strength to get up again , ' she explains			0
' but i thought i 'd just picked up flu coming back to a cold november from the heat of @entity2			1
' @entity1 pictured in hospital with multi-organ failure after three days without any improvement , @entity29 , a hospital driver , had noticed @entity212 's breathing quickening as she slept , and that her golden tan appeared to be turning yellow			1
' he contacted our gp who said i 'd already called and been told it was probably flu - but i was becoming delirious , ' @entity1 recalls			1
' @entity29 told him i could n't remember making the call and asked if i 'd mentioned we 'd just returned from @entity220			0
the gp ordered @entity29 to get me straight to hospital			1
' @entity29 had to support his wife down the stairs to their car to take her to @entity37 at @entity202 , where she rapidly began to deteriorate			0
' doctors were able to tell quite quickly from looking at my blood that it was malaria , but i did n't believe them			1
i kept telling them i had been taking the pills , that i 'd been “ good ” and done what i was told , ' @entity1 says			1
she was transferred to intensive care where she was put into an induced coma - she also developed acute respiratory distress syndrome , inflammation of the lungs that reduces oxygen levels in the blood , and had to be put on a ventilator			0
she needed dialysis to help her kidneys function as they were failing as a result of blackwater fever , a complication of malaria caused by red blood cells bursting in the bloodstream as they are infiltrated by the malaria parasite			1
the number of @entity11 who suffer from gastroenteritis each year she was also suffering from jaundice and cerebral malaria as the parasite caused inflammation of the blood vessels of the brain			2
@entity257 began immediately with intravenous doxycycline , an antibiotic , and quinine to clear the parasite from her bloodstream			0
' i was brought round every day for doctors to be able to monitor my reactions for improvements			0
it was the scariest part because i was so disorientated			0
' i could see balloons and bright lights and thought i was in a freight container being taken back to @entity2 to be married off			1
' she was transferred to @entity273 's infectious diseases and tropical medicine unit			0
it took another two weeks - while she remained in a coma - before she started to improve			0
it took three weeks before she was allowed to return home and ten months before she was well enough to return to work			0
a recent survey for online doctor service @entity281 found one in ten had travelled without vaccinations or malaria medication - many lured by a last - minute deal			2
' putting a holiday before your health is very foolish , not least because these diseases can be fatal and are often also a horrible way to die , ' says dr @entity68			0
' neither can you ignore minor health problems because their impact can be similarly devastating			0
' @entity212 is now all too aware of this			0
' i thought i was doing everything i could , without ever realising the impact of a minor stomach bug on my good intentions			1

@entity1 , 37 , knew what precautions to take on a trip to @entity2
nurse from @entity199 caught stomach bug and malaria pills stopped working
caught severe falciparum malaria and ended up in hospital with organ failure
