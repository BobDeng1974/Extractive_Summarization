mr @entity18 said : ‘ as i was leaving i decided to switch it on			2
i do n’t know what made me do it , i just had a bad feeling			0
‘ and i ’m glad i did , it cost only about £ 40 but the quality of the images was pretty good			0
’ mr @entity18 , who had installed @entity43 outside his home after being burgled twice previously , turned the footage over to police and both intruders were charged with burglary			1
despite the clear evidence , 26 - year - old @entity49 protested his innocence at @entity52 in july			0
he was convicted and bailed but failed to turn up for the next hearing in august , so mr @entity18 , a sales supervisor who was recently made redundant , stepped in again to bring the offender to justice			1

the judge said : ‘ this was a targeted attack			0
the victim had been subjected to two previous burglaries			2
