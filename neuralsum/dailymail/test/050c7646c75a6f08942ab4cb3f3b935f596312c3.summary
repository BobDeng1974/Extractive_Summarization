@entity0 vs @entity1 will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century			1
evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences			0
where @entity13 vs @entity1 comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the @entity18			1
here are my 12 most significant fights in boxing ’s history			1
the fight for race @entity26 v @entity27 july 4 , 1910 in @entity28 , @entity29 @entity27 came out of a six - year retirement to take on @entity26 , the first black heavyweight champion @entity26 , as the first black world heavyweight champion , was the bane of the white supremacists in @entity34 in the early 1900s			1
they hated it when the @entity26 beat @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , in 1908 to win the title they had brandished as the symbol of their racial superiority			1
thus began the quest for @entity46			0
when @entity47 ’d their best hope of all , @entity49 , the crusade to bring their old idol @entity51 out of six - year retirement reached a frenzy			0
@entity27 finally agreed ‘ to respond to that portion of the white race that has been looking for me to defend its athletic superiority ’ – in return for a purse of $ 120,000 ( worth more than three million dollars today )			1
so racist was the press coverage of the build - up to the fight that even the @entity64 wrote : ‘ if the black man wins , thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbours			2
' as the racial tensions grew , the sheriff of @entity28 took the then - unusual step of banning guns and alcohol in the 20,000 capacity arena erected down town			0
@entity27 , by then a contented farmer , had shed more than 100 lbs to get close to his old fighting weight			2
@entity83 hated it when ' @entity85 ( left ) beat @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , in 1908 to win the title and after a frenzied campaign , @entity27 ( right ) agreed to take the fight for what would equal £ 3m the bout was scheduled for 45 rounds but @entity26 said he knew it was as good as over in the fourth when he saw the alarmed reaction to his trademark uppercut and ‘ the old ship sinking			1
’ @entity27 , hitherto undefeated , had never been off his feet but after two knock - downs his corner threw in the towel at the end of the 15th			1
he dismayed white @entity34 by saying : ‘ i could never have whipped @entity26 at my best , not in a thousand years			2
’ symbolically , the @entity102 shook the foundations of @entity34 ’s old white order			0
riots broke out that night in 25 cities across the @entity34 and 50 cities including @entity108 and @entity109			0
as police joined enraged white citizens in subduing black @entity34 celebrations , 20 people were killed and hundreds injured			0
@entity26 continued to anger the racists on several counts			2
as heavyweight champion he reigned another five years before surrendering the crown to white challenger @entity119 , afterwards claiming he had thrown the fight			0
after beating @entity27 convincingly , @entity26 would be world champion for another five years @entity26 then surrendered the crown to white giant @entity119 , and later claimed to have thrown the fight outside the ring he lived the high life of a celebrity and angered the old order again by continuing to marry white wives , three of them in all			1
the @entity34 establishment vented its grudge by accusing him of taking women across state lines for immoral purposes and pursuing him into exile in @entity136 and @entity137			0
he finally gave himself up at the @entity139 border and served a nominal one - year prison sentence			0
before his death , in 1946 at the age of 68 , he collaborated on movies about his life and a @entity146 play entitled ‘ @entity46 ’ @entity26 is still regarded by many boxing historians as the greatest heavyweight of all time .			2
