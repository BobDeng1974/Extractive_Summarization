@entity1 , 77 , was walking outside her house when a rusty manhole cover gave way beneath her			1
she plunged into the cesspit , which was two - thirds full , and would have been unable to climb up its smooth sides			2
police who were called to the home found her shoes nearby and told an inquest she may have hurled them out in a desperate attempt to attract help			1
it is not clear how long she survived but nearly four days elapsed between the last time someone spoke to her and when her body was found at the detached £ 450,000 property in @entity26 , near @entity27			0
recording a verdict of accidental death , dr @entity28 , assistant deputy coroner for @entity29 , said : ‘ the metal cover and brickwork was in a poor state ... it was described as a death trap			1
‘ mrs @entity1 fell into the cesspit and we have heard there was no feasible way of getting out			1
’ widow mrs @entity1 had lived alone since her husband , @entity40 , died in 1994			1
her daily routine involved getting up at 7.30am and having a walk and a cup of tea in her beloved garden			2

they were let in by her step - granddaughter , @entity51 , who drove up from @entity52 with a set of keys			0

@entity46 were first called to the house at 1am on july 2 last year to find all the doors locked and no sign of any trouble ‘ we concluded that somehow she had fallen in			0
the access to the cesspit was heavily corroded			2
i think at some point she stood on the cover and it has given way as there is no strength there			2
if you had gone in there , you would n’t have been able to get out without any assistance			0
we will never know exactly the day that she fell or how long she was in there			2

receipts showed she went to a supermarket in @entity107 on june 27 last year and miss @entity51 ’s cousin spoke to her the following day			0
