by @entity0 @entity1 is shrinking far more quickly that astronomers expected , it has been revealed			2
detailed maps of @entity1 's cliffs and ditches show the solar system 's innermost and smallest planet @entity1 has lost much more real estate due to cooling over four billion years than scientists thought			1
cooling of @entity1 's massive iron core has pared about nine miles from the planet 's diameter , more than twice as much as previous estimates			1
new global imaging and topographic data from @entity19 's messenger craft that show the innermost planet has contracted far more than previous estimates			1
@entity1 is the smallest and closest to the @entity21 of the eight planets in the @entity23 , with an orbital period of about 88 @entity25 days			2
unlike @entity25 , which as several plates of crust , @entity1 has just one rigid , rocky layer which bears telltale cliffs and chasms caused by global contraction			2
' when you look at the actual number , it 's really pityingly small , compared to the size of a planet			2
' but it does n't need to change very much to have some effect , ' said planetary scientist @entity39 , with the @entity41 's @entity40			0
scientists studied more than 5,900 surface features , including cliff - like scarps and wrinkle ridges , to calculate how much @entity1 has condensed			0
unlike @entity25 , which as several plates of crust , @entity1 has just one rigid , rocky layer which bears telltale cliffs and chasms caused by global contraction			0
the measurements , made with @entity19 's @entity1 - orbiting messenger spacecraft , match computer model predictions , which scientists use to determine the planet 's inner composition , chemistry and structure			1
the results are based on a global study of more than 5,900 geological landforms , such as curving cliff - like scarps and wrinkle ridges , that have resulted from the planet 's contraction as @entity1 cooled			1
' an awful lot of a planet 's processes are driven by its heat loss - that 's a primary thing that drives a planet 's evolution , ' @entity39 said			1
' we did n't set out to prove the models right , but it turns out this number is exactly what the models have been predicting for 40 years			0

researchers now say @entity1 is shrinking faster than they expected			0
previous maps of @entity1 's surface map date back to the mid- 1970s			1
@entity19 's @entity90 spacecraft made three flybys of the planet , imaging about 45 percent of its surface			0
that data indicated @entity1 had lost 1.2 to 3 miles in diameter , a finding that clashed with scientists ' heat dissipation models for the planet			1
in addition to learning more about how @entity1 evolved , the discovery has implications for assessing the compositions of planets beyond the solar system			0
' it may be that @entity1 is an archetypal example of what a planet does and how it behaves as it has cooled in time , ' @entity39 said			2
the research is published in the journal @entity112 .			0

shrinkage due to cooling of @entity1 's massive iron core
