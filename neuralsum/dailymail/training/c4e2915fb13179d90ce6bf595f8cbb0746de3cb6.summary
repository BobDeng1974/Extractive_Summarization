just before last summer 's @entity1 i hosted a show alongside @entity4 manager @entity3			1
he took calls from @entity4 fans , and fair to say that show was more of a success for @entity3 than the tournament itself			2
on tuesday i will be on @entity11 from 4pm until 7pm alongside a man who works with @entity3 , the @entity13 expert and one of the most decorated players in the @entity17 game , @entity18			1
if you have n’t got a question for @entity21 then you ’re not a genuine football fan			0
you can send across your questions via @entity24 , using the hashtag # askgnev			1
@entity18 , who works alongside @entity4 boss @entity3 , will be answering questions on @entity11 @entity13 pundits ( @entity28 ) @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity18 we ’ve met before and get on well , i ’ve interviewed him several times too , but this is the first time he has come into the radio station to present a show with me			1
as with any other show we will be looking at the breaking news and issues of the day but there will be so much more			0
i ’ve got about a million questions to ask him on all sorts of subjects including @entity46 , what went wrong in @entity48 , and how long he can continue combining coaching with punditry			0
@entity18 is one of the @entity17 game 's most decorated players following his long @entity46 career you can listen to @entity18 from 4pm to 7pm and send in your questions using the hashtag # askgnev but what i ’m really looking forward to are the questions from the listeners : there were some sharp and intelligent ones posed to @entity3 when he came in , i ’m expecting the same for @entity18 from the amazing @entity11 faithful			1
so listen to the show and ask @entity18 that question you ’ve always wanted to ask			0
a mutual friend of ours told me last week that @entity18 is nervous about working with me			0
no need to be @entity18 , although we may have one or two surprises planned for you			0
@entity3 previously spoke on @entity72 's show and took questions from some intelligent callers			2

@entity18 joins @entity72 on @entity11 from 4pm until 7pm
the @entity4 coach is answering @entity79 *readers* questions on air
you can send in what you want to ask @entity18 using the hashtag # askgnev
