the madwoman in the volvo : my year of raging hormones by @entity4 my heart is broken , my world is dead , my home destroyed			1
i ’m staring into the void			0
’ @entity4 , 49 years old , is in a state of near - despair : anxious , newly - divorced , putting on weight and stumbling through the ruins of a love affair she ’d hoped would be her salvation			1
she is sobbing uncontrollably in her car about the death of her children ’s hamster			2
she is sad , disappointed and confused			0
she is also , she soon discovers , in the early stages of the menopause			2
@entity4 ’s midlife malaise manifests itself with bloating , weight gain and uncontrollable moods , until a diagnosis of menopause galvanises her into finding ways to navigate ‘ the change ’			1
in non-european cultures , menopause is often regarded positively : in @entity52 , for example , it is seen as a time of growth , opening the door to enlightenment and wisdom			0
on this side of the world , meanwhile , the menopause is seen as profoundly unglamorous : three parts desiccation , one part fury , when a woman ’s face becomes a tangle of wrinkles and lost gravity			1
@entity4 laments ‘ the appearance of morning chin hairs that , by noon , are long enough to braid and twirl up into thick princess @entity72 buns ’			1
her solution ? self - help books , wacky , new exercise regimes , a personal trainer , fanatical dieting ( ‘ i have counted the carbs in ketchup ’ ) and a haircut			2
she and her lover manage to patch things up , at first ecstatically reunited , later irritating each other to the point where he temporarily moves out			0
the ups and downs of their relationship provide a metaphor for what is happening inside @entity4 ’s head and body			1
this candid account of @entity4 ’s darkest hour will strike a chord with more women than would ever admit it ( stock picture ) after one of her two daughters — 11 - year - old @entity105 — is teased on @entity106 , for example , @entity4 prepares to exact ruthless revenge on the schoolboy culprit , stationing herself outside his classroom , ready to do violence			1
in the book ’s most moving section , @entity4 charts her devastating feelings as she loses her enthusiasm for being a mother			1
in a terrible admission , she writes that she feels she no longer loves her daughters , that she has nothing left to offer , as she sinks into an emotional paralysis			0
‘ i feel they will immediately read from my dull eyes what i can no longer hide : that i do n’t love them , never will again			0
that ’s the horrible secret at the core of this , the devil ’s sibilant whisper			0
’ happily , her two daughters rise to the occasion , making cards and a sumptuous breakfast , proffering hugs and understanding , until , slowly , @entity4 emerges back into the warm , familiar joy of motherhood			1
this candid account of @entity4 ’s darkest hour will strike a chord with more women than would ever admit it			1
she can be hilarious , such as with her conclusion that no single husband can ever really suffice : ‘ your first husband is the provider ; your second husband is the one who talks to you ; my third husband will be a cat			0
’ everything changes when she consults a doctor who prescribes hormone replacement therapy			0
a dab of topical oestrogen cream on her wrists and , suddenly , her world changes			0
two key truths emerge from this book			0
the first is that women today live longer and have their children later			0
‘ they have adjusted the timetable for childbearing , so that menopause and teaching a teenager how to drive a car will occur in the same week			2
’ the second is that the menopause is traditionally seen as a disease of deficiency — rather than a wholly natural event			2
but @entity4 suggests that , when women are no longer buoyed by oestrogen — the hormone that makes them ‘ want to help people and serve people and cut up their sandwiches into ever - tinier squares ’ — they are free to play a wider role in the world .			1

@entity4 , 49 , suffered bloating , weight gain and uncontrollable moods
diagnosing the menopause led her to find ways to deal with ‘ the change ’
this account of @entity4 ’s darkest hour will strike a chord with many women
