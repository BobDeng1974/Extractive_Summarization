by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 11:01 est , 8 november 2012 vinyl is seen as an outdated medium by some			2
but many music fans covet the pure sound of records , pushing up the price of the rarest gems			2
old favourites @entity9 and @entity10 dominate the new top - 10 list of the most expensive records , taking up nine places in the top 10 countdown			1
only @entity16 break up their stranglehold with a rare version of @entity19 , coming in at number eight in the list compiled by @entity23 magazine			1
all you need is love : the @entity9 dominate the top - 10 in three positions , with two songs by their earlier band @entity28 also appearing			1
@entity29 , @entity30 , left , and @entity31 and bottom , @entity33 , left , and @entity34 the @entity28 pianist @entity35 when he was a friend of @entity33 , left , and with the most valuable record in the @entity37 , right , before he sold it to former bandmate @entity31 anarchy in the @entity37 : @entity10 records appear in an impressive four places , with the price of @entity16 shooting up in the @entity44 year topping the list for a second year is a unique acetate copy of @entity51 / in spite of all the danger by @entity28 - a @entity48 group featuring @entity34 , sir @entity31 and @entity33			1
their 1958 demo recording is valued at £ 200,000 , while at number two is a 1981 reproduction of the single - on seven - inch and 10 - inch vinyl - which goes for a more modest £ 10,000			1
he has no regrets about not making the transition from @entity34 and @entity31 's first band to @entity9 - but @entity35 , who later became a stockbroker , might rue one missed opportunity			1
a vinyl record that mr @entity35 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , kept at the bottom of a drawer in his home for more than 20 years is today named as the most valuable in the world by industry bible @entity23			2
mr @entity35 - known simply as @entity71 - played piano for @entity28 , the forerunners of @entity9 , and had kept the first record cut by @entity34 and @entity31 , which is valued at £ 200,000			1
@entity71 absentmindedly put the original acetate disc , recorded in a @entity77 studio in 1958 , in the bottom of a drawer and forgot about it until the early 1980s , when he sold it back to @entity31 for an undisclosed sum			2
the recording later appeared in the @entity9 ' anthology series , which was released in the 1990s			2
@entity31 later recalled : ' we shared the record			0
i kept it for a week , @entity33 kept it for a week , @entity35 kept it for a week , [ drummer ] @entity91 kept it for a week , then @entity71 kept it for 23 years			0
' the magazine , which publishes its list today , places the @entity97 / @entity96 at number three			1
a rare acetate version would fetch roughly £ 10,000			0
originally released in 1977 , prices appear to have shot up around 60 per cent as the @entity16 celebrates her @entity44 year , with one copy fetching £ 12,630 in recent months			1
the tracks were pressed to help manager @entity103 secure a new deal for the group after they were axed by @entity107			0
another version of the same record , when the group were briefly on @entity110 , is valued at £ 8,000			0
although 20,000 copies were made , most were destroyed , making it a collector 's item			1
the punk idols are also at number five with the acetate copy of @entity118 , with no fun on the b - side , its price estimated at £ 7,000			2
only three copies are known to exist			0
the @entity28 recording at the top of the list was created in july 1958 by the @entity9 trio plus @entity35 on piano and drummer @entity127 , who headed into a studio after shelling out a few shillings			1
the acetate version ended up in @entity35 's hands and he eventually sold it to sir @entity31 , who is still thought to own it			2
he had it restored and it was used to make the handful of 1981 copies			0
the lower reaches of the top 200 in the magazine show growing prices for @entity37 heavy metal acts such as @entity142 , at 189 with a rare brown vinyl 12 - inch version of @entity145 going for £ 800 , and @entity147 's @entity146 at 191 , valued at a similar amount			1
@entity149 , editor of the @entity150 who compiled the list for @entity23 , said : ' when it comes to collectable rare vinyl , the @entity9 remain the blue chip investment , and no doubt the recent 50th anniversary of the release of their debut single @entity159 has helped focus collectors ' minds on the longevity and power of their music as well as inflate prices for mint copies of their albums , singles and eps			0
test of time : records made by @entity37 metal acts are beginning to climb the chart as collectors spot lasting classics ' the appeal of @entity9 collectables is worldwide			0
i was in @entity181 last week and when i asked the head buyer of one of the biggest dealing shops in the country what artist or genre was the most collectable in @entity181 , although he did not speak any @entity188 , he had one word for me , " @entity9 "			0
' @entity28 acetate is now , in musical terms , a holy tablet equivalent to the @entity193 that moses brought down from the mount			1
' it is ironic that , despite the fact that back in the 70s the @entity10 were the epitome of anti-establishment attitude , today they are one of the most collectable bands in the world with mint copies of rarities being seen as a safe blue chip investment			0
the @entity44 not only crowned her longevity as a ruler but also their own as the top collectable punk band in the world			1
' mr @entity149 said little - known bands who made little impact or money in their careers can now command huge prices			0
' there is a real hunger for mint copies of collectable late 60s and early 70s @entity221 , with obscure acts like @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , july and @entity226 , to name a few - whose records only sold a few hundred copies at the time - now fetching four - figure sums			0
