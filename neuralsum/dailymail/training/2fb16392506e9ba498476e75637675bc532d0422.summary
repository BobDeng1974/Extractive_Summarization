by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:48 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 21 may 2013 just for a moment , she still looked so proud			0
the sun broke through briefly to illuminate her in the water , maintaining that air of might and majesty that only @entity10 ’s most famous warship could boast			0
yet this was the saddest day in the illustrious life of @entity13			2
her deck was stripped bare of aircraft and her hull was streaked with years of rust and neglect			0
final journey : @entity13 leaves @entity21 for the last time yesterday bound for the @entity24 scrapyard after plans to save the vessel failed empty : the warship , which was used in the 2003 invasion of @entity29 , lies empty as it leaves @entity30 yesterday and was waved off for the last time crowds : hundreds gathered in @entity21 yesterday to wave off the @entity13 as she left @entity30 for the last time goodbye : @entity35 flags flutter in the wind on the south coast yesterday as the @entity13 leaves @entity10 for the final time - this time for the scrapyard departure : the deck empty , the @entity13 is towed to @entity24 and to the scrapyard yesterday after more than a quarter of a century of service , the aircraft carrier – the fifth @entity44 ship to bear a name that dates back to the days of victory over the @entity47 – began her final , solemn journey to the scrapyard			1
she was n’t even allowed the romantic privilege of sailing into the sunset at the 30 knots she was capable of			0
instead , tugs hauled her slowly out of @entity21 harbour towards her last resting place in @entity24			2
the ultimate indignity is still to come			0
soon , she will be broken up and recycled to make razor blades and tin cans			0
no wonder former crewmen wore black armbands on the dockside			0
no wonder there were more tears than cheers from the hundreds who gathered , like mourners , to say their farewells			0
goodbye : a large crowd of people watch as the @entity13 is towed out of @entity21 harbour yesterday for the last time bound for @entity24 departure : @entity13 was the fifth ship to bear the same name when she was launched in 1981			1
however , she was taken out of service in 2010 under government spending cuts farewell : a large crowd gathered in @entity21 yesterday as the ship made its final voyage			1
the 22,000 - tonne light aircraft carrier has been sold to ship recycling firm @entity83 for £ 2.9million			1
the ship will be taken 2,000 miles to @entity86 in west @entity24 goodbye : the @entity13 was the fifth ship to be called the @entity89 , a name that dates back to 1587 left : @entity13 leaves for the last time yesterday , being pulled by this ship in front			1
the aircraft carrier is being taken to @entity24 where it will be dismantled by ship recycling firm @entity83 salute : a small crowd gathers on the beach as the ship is towed away for the last time ready to be scrapped send off : a man watches as the @entity13 is towed out of @entity21 for @entity24 on its final journey warship : a harrier jet hovers as it comes in to land on the flight deck of @entity13 in july 2010 during an exercise as it was announced the warship would be axed anniversary : the @entity13 makes her way past the @entity111 in 2007 as the navy marked the @entity113 25th @entity108 two engineering triumphs : the @entity13 passes under the @entity115 in @entity116 after taking part in training exercises in 2004 weight : 22,000 tons power : four @entity123 gas powered engines which produce 97,000 @entity124 cost : £ 320million length : 210metres conflicts : 2003 @entity29 war and @entity128 launched : june 2 , 1981 what happens to her now : sold for scrap retirement date : 2016 ( brought forward five years by the @entity133 ) motto : @entity135 does not rest constructed : @entity137 's @entity136 , @entity138 aircraft : can hold up to 24 planes once , they would have assembled here as ‘ the mighty ark ’ returned from war to a ‘ welcome home ’ celebration with splendid military pomp			1
yesterday , most stood in silence or simply waved @entity148 as the 22,000 - ton ship came into view , and went			0
the most miserable epitaph for @entity13 and what ’s left of the @entity44 is that her decommissioning and sale to a foreign country for £ 2.9million was claimed by defence bosses yesterday to have saved taxpayers more than £ 100million			1
the ship , which carried 22 aircraft and had a complement of 1,051 , was retired five years ahead of schedule in 2011 , a high - profile casualty of the government ’s controversial defence review			2
there was outrage at the prospect of selling the ship online , with plans to turn her into a casino in @entity173 , a floating hospital or a commercial diving wreck all rejected			1
@entity176 , however , sent her on the same 2,000 - mile journey her sister ship made two years ago			1
@entity180 , heroine of the @entity182 , also went for scrap			0
among those lining @entity21 ’s old harbour yesterday was @entity186 , a stores assistant who was one of the first to serve on board after she was launched in 1981 at a cost of £ 320million			1
‘ it ’s a very emotional day , ’ he said			0
@entity191 , a former @entity191 petty officer , said the memories will ‘ remain for ever ’			0
‘ to the last , she showed the character of a proper lady of the seas , ’ he added			0

the @entity89 was originally the name given to a ship ordered for sir @entity227 in 1586			0
it was involved in the battles against the @entity47 , and served for more than 50 years			2
that first ship was eventually broken up in 1638 , and it was almost 300 years before another vessel bore the same name			2
the second @entity13 , launched in 1914 , was the first ship designed to carry aircraft in history			1
