by @entity0 last updated at 12:58 am on 13th december 2011 it was a tale of our times played out on the pages of social networking sites			2
@entity6 was 12 and @entity7 14 when they started going out together			1
within two years they had a child and their relationship was already scarred by drug abuse , binge drinking and allegations of infidelity			2
teenage mother : @entity17 , killed by boyfriend @entity18 , and her 3 year old baby @entity19 and by the time @entity6 was 17 she was dead – strangled by @entity7 in an alcohol - fuelled row over claims of sleeping around			1
in the words of his barrister , ‘ they were much too young , both of them ’			2
@entity29 added : ‘ it was a disastrous cocktail , because they had powerful adult feelings but the immaturity of children			0
’ yesterday at @entity35 , @entity7 was jailed for a minimum of 16 years after being convicted of murder			0
the jury rejected his claim of diminished responsibility as a result of borderline personality disorder			0
defence experts claimed this explained his disruptive behaviour at the many schools he passed through and propensity for starting fires and reckless driving			0
@entity18 and @entity6 were described as having a volatile relationship however a psychologist called by the prosecution said his state of mind had more to do with his self - confessed consumption of a bottle of spirits a day and £ 1,000 worth of cocaine every weekend			1
@entity7 met @entity6 in @entity58 , @entity59 , only a year after she had started secondary school , and within 12 months he had made her pregnant			1
he was already a heavy drinker and had been thrown out of ten schools which could not cope with his ‘ extreme anger problems ’			0
their daughter @entity19 was born in 2008 when @entity6 was 14 and @entity66 16			1
a few months later , @entity6 wrote on @entity67 how she could not wait to leave school and enjoyed ‘ goin out with tha girls drinkin n all tha ’			1
telling how she adored their daughter , she added : ‘ love my callum 2 bits as well there both amazin			2
’ by now , @entity7 had dropped out of the education system and was using cocaine and high - strength cannabis , paid for by car theft and burglary			2
in 2008 he was given three years ’ detention for supplying crack cocaine and heroin , a separation which fuelled what would be persistent and overwhelming suspicion that @entity6 was unfaithful to him			1
saying he could not face their child being raised by another man , he wrote on @entity67 that he hoped she would have a nice @entity88 ‘ cus i no i wil of bin away n kiled meself by then ’			0
he attempted to take a drug overdose and later tried to hang himself with his bedsheets , but was rescued by prison staff			0
on his release in 2010 , to the alarm of @entity6 ’s family , the relationship resumed and @entity7 got a job at a skip hire firm			1
but far from bringing him stability , it helped him afford a drug habit which had spiralled to spending £ 1,600 on cocaine every weekend with friends			0
not surprisingly , the relationship remained chaotic			0
‘ when it was good it was brilliant , but when it was bad it was absolutely terrible , ’ @entity7 told the court , admitting he had slept with @entity6 ’s cousin			1
@entity6 had told @entity18 their daughter was n't his during a heated argument ‘ we often had fights , hitting each other			1
there have been times when we have both called the police on each other			0
’ @entity6 – who had gone on to college – became pregnant by him again , but in the spring of this year she had an abortion , saying she was seeing a man called @entity125 and wanted to break up			1
@entity7 called her to say he was about to hang himself by the @entity126 , but after she pleaded with him he came home			0
on april 28 , the eve of prince @entity131 ’s wedding to @entity132 , they spent the evening at a friend ’s flat in @entity134			0
@entity6 was drinking alcopops while @entity7 downed vodka on top of around eight cans of @entity140 lager he had drunk earlier in the day			1
the following day , he told the court , she accused him of being an ‘ alkie ’ and he held her neck until she passed out			2
when she came round , he said she taunted him , saying neither their daughter nor her aborted baby had been his and telling him : ‘ you are a s * * * sh * g , @entity125 is ten times better ’			2
‘ i was filling up with anger and i could n’t hold it any more , ’ he told the court			2
’ he strangled her again , leaving her lying unconscious , and she died in hospital the following day			0
' they had powerful adult feelings but had the immaturity of children ' the court was told he told police : ‘ i wanted her to die			2
i felt she had to get out of my life			0
if i was sober it probably would n’t have even entered my mind			0
but i was off my head big time			0
’ the jury took just an hour to reject the 19 - year - old ’s plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
@entity6 ’s mother @entity170 , who is looking after @entity19 , said she accepted the sentence , adding : ‘ all i know is he can never hurt my beautiful girl any more			1
’ she went on : ‘ @entity6 ’s death devastated the whole family and has left a huge hole in our lives			1
to have her taken away from us so suddenly is something we have all struggled to deal with , but we have had to stay strong for her little girl who has been left without a mummy			0
’ on @entity184 , a friend of @entity6 wrote : ‘ callum @entity187 u sik evil twistd t * * * , how cud u murder the mother of ur bby girl now she has to grow up noin her daddy killed her mummy ! ! ‘ @entity193 shud be plannin ur 18th not ur funreal ! u wer so young an guwjus everyones thinkin of u my heart gose out to ur family n babby girl @entity198			1

@entity18 , 19 , said ' he just exploded ' after his girlfriend *'s* *repeated* taunting
@entity6 also told @entity204 their three - year - old daughter was n't his
