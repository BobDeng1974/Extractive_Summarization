hacking victims : @entity24 , right , who was killed in the 7/7 bombings in 2005 , had his voicemails hacked on the day he died but his father @entity7 , left , says hacked off is ' not representative ' of victims he and his wife decided not to sue @entity31 for compensation			1
he insists the wrongdoing was already covered by the criminal law			2
mr @entity7 , from @entity35 , said : ‘ the fact is , phone hacking and bribery of officials is in itself a criminal offence			1
it is being dealt with in the criminal courts			2
any law that says it ’s against the law to break the law is just a nonsense			0
’ labour leader @entity47 was ‘ shameless ’ in allowing hacked off , the celebrity campaign group fronted by @entity49 , to be involved in the late - night deal struck between the parties last week on press regulation following @entity54 ’s inquiry , he said			1
‘ they are a pressure group			0
hacked off became a major force and have swamped the media with their version of events and what they think should happen			2
‘ @entity28 seem to have cosied up to the @entity5 to such an extent that we ca n’t distinguish between them			0
the parties have used @entity54 as a cosh to beat each other with			0
terror attack : despite having his phone hacked after the 7/7 @entity70 bombings , mr @entity7 insists that the laws hacked @entity28 is pushing for are a knee - jerk reaction and ' a nonsense ' ‘ what concerns me greatly is that this crucial issue of @entity76 is being steamrollered through			1
it ’s happening because of the political pressure rather than a desire to do the right thing			0
’ while he had initially welcomed the @entity81 , thinking it would help ordinary people , he said he thought the judge had ‘ lost his way ’ once celebrities became involved			0

political : actor @entity49 from the hacked off campaign with @entity94 dr @entity93 , right and journalist @entity95 left at last year 's annual @entity94 conference the imprisonment of former @entity94 mp @entity99 and the @entity100 ’ expenses scandal were examples of how the @entity6 could hold politicians to account , mr @entity7 said			1
‘ i ’m really concerned that @entity28 have created a head of steam with quite a high emotional content and the parties have got suckered into this			0
' it would be a dark day when politicians are allowed to interfere with the @entity76			0
