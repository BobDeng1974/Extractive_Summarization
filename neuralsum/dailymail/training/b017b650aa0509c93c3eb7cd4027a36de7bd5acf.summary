while pandas are often criticised as slow , lazy and maybe not the brightest of the bears , the young ones at a @entity2 breeding centre are far from that , when motivated enough			0
in their case , the lure of milk in a neighbouring enclosure is enough to inspire a bit of extra effort from these giant pandas who manage to contort their cumbersome bodies through cell - like bars			1
these pieces of footage comes from @entity20 cameras behind the scenes at the @entity22			1
the centre is the same one that tourists can go to if they want to volunteer to be a panda keeper for the day for about £ 35 , with a one - minute cuddle with one of the teenage bears an added bonus for £ 200			2
and for superfans of the cuddly panda , the cameras show rolling footage of the animals online			2
known as @entity35 , the cameras broadcast the daily lives of the animals around the world , allowing viewers to flick between cameras in the cages of both youngsters and adults with their babies			0
footage shows how curiosity gets the better of the pandas as they squeeze through the bars of neighbouring cells			1
the neighbouring enclosure 's milk was the inspiration for this panda , who slid easily through the bars another panda at the @entity22 shows its contortion skills the first clever one has no problem getting next door without the key on @entity63 2014 , and shows how much fluff makes up its body mass while going through the metal bars			1

footage of another from december 17 , 2013 , is a little tough to watch given how cute the creature is as its head gets stuck			0
this giant panda makes the mistake of , once getting his head through the bars , attempting to retreat			0
its friends on the other side first come over to help - or play , it 's hard to tell - before a keeper notices the predicament and decides pulling the head through would work			0
in the end , the keeper urged the panda to continue on the originally desired path and soon all the pandas were together on the same side of the bars , with the stricken one looking a bit exhausted			1
this giant panda gets its head through the bars but changes its mind and attempts to go back the keeper tried pushing its head back , unsuccessfully , before leading it to continue moving forward			2
