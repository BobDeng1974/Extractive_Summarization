by @entity0 in every region of @entity2 , white and @entity4 children are far better positioned for success than black , @entity8 and @entity7 children , according to a new report appealing for urgent action to bridge this racial gap			1
titled ' race for results , ' the report is being released on tuesday by the @entity15 , which for decades has worked to improve child well - being in the @entity2			2
the foundation also produces annual ' kids count ' reports , with reams of state - specific data , but these generally have not focused on race			0
the new report tackles the topic head - on , with charts and ratings that convey dramatic racial discrepancies			0
the report described the challenges facing black children as ' a national crisis ' ( @entity32 ) at the core of the report is a newly devised index based on 12 indicators measuring a child 's success from birth to adulthood			1
the indicators include reading and math proficiency , high school graduation data , teen birthrates , employment prospects , family income and education levels , and neighborhood poverty levels			1
using a single composite score with a scale of one to 1,000 , @entity4 children have the highest index score at 776 , followed by white children at 704			1
' @entity55 ( 404 ) , @entity56 - @entity7 ( 387 ) and @entity56 ( 345 ) children are distressingly lower , and this pattern holds true in nearly every state , ' said the report			1
@entity56 students are the least likely to succeed , the study found @entity63 , the @entity15 's president , said the findings are ' a call to action that requires serious and sustained attention from the private , nonprofit , philanthropic and government sectors to create equitable opportunities for children of color			0
' the report was based on data from 2012 , including census figures tallying the number of @entity2 children under 18 at 39 million whites , 17.6 million latinos , 10.2 million blacks , 3.4 million of @entity4 descent , and 640,000 @entity7 , as well as about 2.8 million children of two or more races			1
under census definitions , @entity77 can be of various racial groups			0
the report described the challenges facing @entity56 children as ' a national crisis			0
' for black children , the states with the lowest scores were in the @entity92 and upper @entity91 — with @entity93 at the bottom , followed closely by @entity95 and @entity96			1
the highest scores were in states with relatively small black populations — @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
outcomes varied for different subgroups of @entity4 and @entity8 children			1
for example , in terms of family income levels , children of @entity4 descent — @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 — faced greater hurdles than children whose families came from @entity120 , @entity121 , the @entity122 and @entity123			2
among @entity77 , children of @entity126 and @entity125 descent faced the biggest barriers to success ; those of @entity131 and @entity130 descent fared better in the index			0
the state with the highest score for @entity8 children was @entity103 , at 573			2
the lowest was @entity136 , at 331			0
only 25 states provided enough data to compile scores for @entity7 children			2
their scores were highest in @entity143 ( 631 ) , @entity136 ( 568 ) , @entity144 ( 554 ) and @entity145 ( 553 ) , and lowest in the upper @entity91 , the @entity146 and the @entity147			0
the score for @entity7 children in @entity150 — 185 — was the lowest of any group in any state on the index			2
some of @entity150 's @entity7 reservations are among the poorest nationwide , which contributes to high levels of domestic violence , alcoholism and drug abuse , fetal - alcohol syndrome , teen pregnancy and low graduation rates			1
the report found sharp differences in @entity7 children 's outcomes based on tribal affiliation			2
for example , @entity170 children were far more likely than @entity173 children to live in economically struggling families			0
among its recommendations , the report urged concerted efforts to collect and analyze race - specific data on child well - being that could be used to develop programs capable of bridging the racial gap			1
it said special emphasis should be placed on expanding job opportunities as children in the disadvantaged groups enter adulthood			0
' regardless of our own racial background or socio - economic position , we are inextricably interconnected as a society , ' the report concluded			0
' we must view all children in @entity2 as our own — and as key contributors to our nation 's future			0
' the study created its own 1,000 point scoring system			1
@entity4 children scored the highest , followed by white , @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity56			1

a new report says @entity4 and white children in the @entity2 are better positioned for success than @entity8 , @entity7 and black children
on a 1,000 point scale : @entity4 children scored 776 ; white scored 704 ; @entity8 scored 404 ; @entity7 scored 387 ; and black scored 345
the study measured 12 factors including reading and math proficiency , high school graduation data , teen birthrates , and employment prospects
the report urged more programs be developed to bridge the racial *divide* among children
