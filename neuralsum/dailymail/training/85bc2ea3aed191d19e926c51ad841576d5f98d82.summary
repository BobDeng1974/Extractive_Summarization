he told me the more outrageous i behaved , the higher level i would get			0
it was like a reward system			0
’ on one occasion after obeying his sexually explicit instructions , she told the court : ‘ @entity3 congratulated me by saying : “ i did n’t think you had it in you – you really pleased the spirit world ”			1
