a beauty queen who beat the bulge and dropped four dress sizes has offered advice to others battling with their weight			1
@entity6 , 24 , the newly crowned miss @entity7 , was tipping the scales at 16 stone thanks to an unhealthy diet based on fast food and alcohol before an unflattering @entity15 photo persuaded her to make a change			1
the grim photos , taken on her 20th birthday , made her realise how much weight she had gained and a confrontation with her mother brought matters to a head			1
' then i went to university , i had even more control over what i ate and my weight just got out of hand			1
' the quantity of food and drinking i was doing was too much			1
' it was n't until my 20th birthday , when i saw pictures of myself on @entity15 , and my mum mentioned it , that i realised i had put on so much			1
' my mum was concerned because she is diabetic and she expressed concerns about my size			1
' @entity26 , who has since slimmed to a petite size 8 added : ' i had been caught off guard and there was just so much of me and i think that was when i thought ' my mum is right			1
' the first thing i did was search @entity65 for healthy living tips			1
i did n't want to diet like so many of my friends had done , i just wanted to lose the weight in a healthy and sustainable way			1
' binge drinking : industrial quantities of booze made @entity26 pile on the pounds and also affected her skin the gym was once an alien place for the previously overwight @entity26 , whose diet consisted of greasy takeaways having shed four dress sizes , pretty @entity26 , who had previously entered the @entity38 competition twice before without success , tried again and this time succeeded			1
this she puts down to her healthier lifestyle , which includes small changes such as having skimmed milk , wholemeal bread and cutting out fizzy drinks and alcohol			1
she said : ' it was nothing drastic , but i felt this was the best way			1
so over the next three years it gradually fell off			2
' i also go to the gym about three times a week			2
i wo n't ever let myself get to that stage again			2
' and her miss @entity7 title is n't the only pageant title she 's won since fighting off the flab			1
last year , @entity26 , who is of @entity105 decent , won the title of the @entity107 and claimed the first prize : a six day luxury trip to the island over @entity111			2
coincidentally it just so happened to be her great - grandmother 's 100th birthday on @entity116			1
@entity26 said : ' she was in so much shock			2
she has n't seen me for 13 years so at first she did n't even recognise me			2
' it was such an amazing trip			2
and being able to go for six days over @entity111 , when her birthday fell on @entity116 , was so lucky , it was fate			2
' now @entity26 is pursuing a singing career as well as working with miss @entity38			1
what a difference ! now plump @entity26 has become healthy , slim @entity26 and miss @entity7 to boot gym bunny : although @entity26 spends plenty of time on the treadmill , she says it does n't have to be every day she said : ' the whole miss @entity38 experience was incredible			1
i was with everyone for four days straight and you really start to become a family			2
i enjoyed myself so much			2
' i made some great friends			2
the rumours you hear about beauty pageants being catty are n't true , everyone was really friendly			2
once you 're in , you 're part of it forever			0
' as for losing the weight , @entity26 says she is more confident than she has ever been before			1
she said : ' it has been bizarre after losing all of the weight			1
i look completely different and people who knew me then do n't recognise me now			0
' it has given me the confidence i did n't have before , i 'm happier and most importantly i 'm healthier which was my main goal			0
swap white for brown : ' ditch white carbohydrates in favour of wholemeal			0
think brown bread , brown pasta and brown rice			0
this is such an easy rule to stick to and i noticed the difference almost immediately - less bloating and more energy			0
do n't skip meals : ' three meals a day and plenty of water will stop you unnecessarily snacking			0
try and eat things that will keep you fuelled longer in the mornings such as porridge or muesli with skimmed milk , then try a heavy salad or chicken and vegetables for lunch			0
this will enable you to eat lighter for dinner and resist the urge to snack			0
drinks count too : ' we often forget that what we are drinking is just as important as our food diet			0
cut out fizzy drinks , drink plenty of water and herbal teas			0
remember , everything in moderation - even fruit juice contains lots of sugar			0
have fun : ' do n't jeopardise your social life , remember you can still pick healthy options when eating out			1
a favourite of mine is the @entity203 salad at @entity204 , packed full of artichokes , sun dried tomatoes and chicken and do remember alcohol can heavily contribute to weight gain ( this was one of my biggest downfalls when i was at my heaviest ) and can have a detrimental affect on your skin , liver and overall health			1
stay clear of saturated fat : ' saturated fats are a tough one for us all			0
we love a croissant in the morning or cheese and crackers after dinner but these create the fatty pockets we all hate			0
instead enjoy good fats in moderation and try switching your regular cooking oil for olive oil			0
stay active : ' an active lifestyle will keep you in shape but even if you 're busy and feel you do n't have time for the gym , try home - work outs			0
i am a huge fan of these and there is so much you can do			0
10 minute ab work - outs : ' i try to do this every day ! i use a different ab exercise for every two minutes of my 10 minute work - out			0
@entity244 and side plank is always a must for me , bicycles to work your obliques , crunches to work your upper abs , full sit ups to work everything and leg raises to work your lower abs. ' 8			1
keep glutes and hamstrings toned : ' try leg lifts			0
on all fours , lift your legs to a 90 degree angle			0
try doing sets on each leg alternating eight times on each			0
keep your quads toned too - try lunges , which are easy to do at home and a great exercise for toned thighs			0
inner thighs and bum : ' to keep these toned i do ' @entity273 ' squats , which are your normal squat but with hands out in front and feet pointing outwards slightly			0
it 's similar to the pli√© ballet move but with your bottom out rather than tucked in			1
running : ' i make excuses all the time about this one but it 's so easy to go for a quick run around your local area			1
even a quick 10 minute mile will get you feeling fresh and motivated and burn fat			0
