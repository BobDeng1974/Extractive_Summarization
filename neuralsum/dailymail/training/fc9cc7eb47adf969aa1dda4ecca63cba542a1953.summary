humans remains of people killed 13,000 years ago in what scientists believe is the oldest identified race war , are today due to go on display at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
two skeletons from a massacre in the @entity11 desert in @entity12 , which killed at least 26 people , will be shown in the new @entity15 gallery , alongside the flint - tipped weapons with which they were killed			1
@entity20 scientists have been working with the museum to examine dozens of skeletons that were found grouped together in the @entity25 cemetery - one of the earliest organised burial grounds - on the east bank of the @entity28 , northern @entity29 , in the 1960s			1
a pair of skeletons belonging to people who were killed on a massacre 13,000 years ago as the result of climate change , are going on show in the @entity6 , @entity7			1
pencils pinpoint out pieces of weaponry responsible for their demise the cemetery was discovered in 1965			2
it contained at least 61 individuals dating back about 13,000 years ago			2
the graveyard is one of the earliest formal cemeteries in the world			0
prior to the discovery , only isolated graves , or clusters of up to three bodies had been known within the @entity28 , experts at the @entity6 write in a blog post			2
out of the 61 skeletons found buried at the site , at least 45 per cent of them died from inflicted wounds			2
the remains are the earliest evidence for inter-communal violence in the archaeological record			0
fragments of arrows and weapons were found alongside the bodies – with some weapons embedded in the bones			0
cut marks were also found on the bones			0
they believe the remains of the 60 individuals found - around half of which had cut marks on their bones - represent the first communal violence between groups			1
fighting probably broke out because of the environmental disaster of the @entity83 , which caused the attackers and victims to live together in a smaller area , the experts explained			1
@entity87 , the museum 's curator of early @entity15 , told @entity89 that the attackers and victims were hunter - gatherers who usually avoided violence by moving on when a certain area became overcrowded			0
but she believed that the cold and dry conditions of the @entity28 around that time caused a ' population crisis ' , as more people moved to the same area surrounded by desert			2
she said : ' things were probably very tight , so we think that people started picking on one another			0
' the museum acquired the remains in 2002 when they were donated by @entity104 , an @entity105 archaeologist who excavated the site in the 1960s			1
at least 60 individuals were found and examined using modern technology			1
one body was found with 39 pieces of flint from arrows and other flint - tipped weapons , dr @entity110 said			0
@entity20 scientists have been working with the @entity6 to examine dozens of skeletons that were found grouped together in the @entity25 cemetery			1
an image of excavations at @entity25 in 1965 is pictured the cemetery was discovered in 1965			1
it contained at least 61 individuals dating back about 13,000 years ago			0
the graveyard ( illustrated showing the position in which the skeletons were found , ) is one of the earliest formal cemeteries in the world they believe the remains of the 60 individuals found ( a skull is pictured ) represent the first communal violence between groups because almost half the remains have cut marks on them experts think that climate change sparked the violence			1
@entity83 glaciers covering much of @entity141 and @entity142 at this time made the climate in @entity15 and @entity29 cold and arid , forcing people to live near the @entity28			2
but the river was either wild or low and sluggish			0
there was little land on which people to live safely and resources were scarce			0
competition for food may have been the reason for the violence as more groups of people had to stake a claim on the best fishing spots and sites to live			0
two other cemeteries found nearby the main site suggest other social units , or small tribes , also considered the area their home and this may have caused friction			2
but the remains buried in the other graveyards show no signs of violence			0
so people buried in ‘ @entity174 ’ were either unlucky , or the resting place was chosen for people who dies of battle wounds			0
as well as the human remains , the display will include flint arrowhead fragments and a healed forearm fracture , which was most likely sustained by a victim who was trying to defend himself during conflict			2
over the past two years , anthropologists from @entity185 have managed to find dozens of previously undetected conflict marks on the victims ' bones			0
the @entity6 scientists are now planning to research more about the victims themselves , including their gender , their age and their diet			1
meanwhile , according to @entity199 , work carried out at @entity201 @entity200 , the @entity196 and @entity197 ’ @entity195 suggests these humans were part of the general @entity205 originating population , who were ancestors of modern @entity207			0
dr. @entity208 , a curator in the @entity6 ’s @entity15 and @entity209 , told the paper : ' the skeletal material is of great importance – not only because of the evidence for conflict , but also because the @entity25 cemetery is the oldest discovered in the @entity28 so far			1
' the cemetery where the remains were discovered in the 1960s is one of the earliest organised burial grounds in the world and lies on the east bank of the @entity28 , northern @entity29 ( marked ) human remains from the first known human massacre which scientists believe was carried out in @entity12 during the @entity83 are due to go on display today for the first time at the @entity6 in @entity227 the skeletons include two bodies from the mass murder of at least 26 people who were found buried in the @entity25 cemetery on the east bank of the @entity28 , northern @entity29 , in the 1960s ( stock pic )			1

skeletons from first human massacre will be displayed at @entity6
remains from @entity239 found in @entity25 cemetery in @entity11 desert
scientists say mass murder caused by ' environmental disaster ' of @entity83
at least 60 individuals found in excavation by @entity105 archaeologist
