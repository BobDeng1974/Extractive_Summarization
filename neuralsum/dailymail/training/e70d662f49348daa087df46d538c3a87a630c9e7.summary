for most of us , roadside services are a road trip 's necessary evil - an oasis off the motorway offering fast food , pre-packaged sandwiches and fuel			1
for @entity10 , they 're an adventure worth celebrating and sharing with the world			0
after performing at the @entity17 live concert in @entity18 , formula one world champion @entity14 's other half did a service to services everywhere by giving them , bizarrely along with @entity22 as a whole , her most enthusiastic endorsement in a fun @entity28 saga			1
' here 's alit story , an adventure with # @entity43 when she 's on the @entity44 after a show and discovers a service station in the # @entity22 ! ' she posted with a sneaky plug for her single run from her second solo album @entity50			2
but then came her disappointment at said pizza joint being closed			0
after her excitement at seeing a @entity38 's , the singer is disappointed to see the pizza outlet closed @entity10 , 36 , performs at the @entity17 live concert at @entity18 's @entity57 on saturday ' @entity58 ! there 's a @entity60 in the @entity22 ! wait , what ? ! it 's not open ? ? ? ' all was n't lost though for our intrepid adventurer though , with a taste of her home in the @entity66 , @entity67 , on offer			1
' but wait ! # @entity69 is still open , taking me back , to back home # @entity67			0
live it , love it taste it , who does n't want some of that ! ? ' of course , it was then time for a romantic interlude in the former x factor judge 's little tale with the love interest being a @entity81 outlet - she was so taken by the sugary treats her hashtag was all - encompassing			0
' is that a # krispykreme i dare see ? ! # everything , ' she posted home comforts ! @entity10 , who calls @entity67 home when in the @entity66 , plugs its associated @entity89 far from her glamorous usual self , the star straddles a @entity81 doughnut stand - also closed she had to settle for a selection of chocolate bars at the end of her ' adventure ' , but did n't seem to mind after flashing her washboard abs during an energetic set , @entity10 went hunting fast food chocolate bars served as the stars for the big finale , though we doubt their ending is as happy as @entity10 's			1
' my adventure has come to an end and i figured why not top it off with some @entity111 candy bars ! i love this country and their service stations			0
' unfortunately , it is not known which services exactly received such praise from the star , but surely it wo n't be long until they 're cashing in on the @entity10 seal of approval .			2
