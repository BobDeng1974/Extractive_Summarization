many pregnant women worry about sleepless nights and how they will juggle the demands of a newborn with daily life			2
but for @entity7 , 38 , her pregnancy is simply filled with gleeful anticipation of giving her new baby away			2
for the chef , who lives in north @entity11 , is currently pregnant with her eleventh child , and as a surrogate mother , has already waved goodbye to ten biological children of her own			1
@entity7 with two of her own children , @entity17 and @entity18 , and some of the children she ahs given birth to as a surrogate mother in an interview with the mirror , @entity7 said she decided to become a surrogate as she loved motherhood and was keen to help other people have a family of their own			1
with two children of her own , and in her late teens , she overheard a conversation where people were discussing surrogacy and decided to contact the organisation @entity33 ( @entity33 ) to find out more			0
after a counselling session to make sure she was ready , she opted to be a ' straight surrogate ' using her own eggs and the intended father 's sperm which she artificially inseminated herself			1
@entity7 chose to help a couple where the wife was infertile , and became pregnant after the eighth attempt , with her first surrogate child , @entity42 , in 2001			1
she said seeing the emotion on the new parents ' faces when she handed over the baby helped her realise she had made the right decision and 18 months later , became a surrogate again , going on to give birth to @entity50 in 2002 and @entity51 in 2003			0
her own two children , who were now aged six and seven , always knew the children she was carrying would not be part of their family and there was no stopping her			0
@entity7 ( right ) and her wife , @entity58 , with one of the surrogate children immediately after the birth close : @entity7 said she is aware @entity58 worries about her health and would like her to retire from surrogacy ' i had @entity65 in 2005 , @entity66 in 2007 , @entity67 in 2008 , @entity68 in 2009 , @entity69 in 2011 , @entity70 in 2013 and @entity71 in 2014 - the parents all name their own babies , ' she told @entity74			1
@entity7 has bounced back quickly from each drug - free birth , although at 29 weeks pregnant , she is currently facing the prospect of delivering her 11th surrogate child via caesarian section due to a low lying placenta			1
@entity7 married her partner @entity58 last summer and praised her for her support during the last three pregnancies , although she said she was aware that her new wife would like her to retire from surrogacy			2
she said it was strange to know there were ten children out there who shared her genes and she kept in touch with some of them including @entity68 and @entity65 who were flower girl and pageboy at her wedding			0
however , she said while she was aware that each pregnancy brought with it additional health risks , she was not ready to give up			0
