pressure is mounting in @entity1 to exhume the bones of the tragic last @entity4 emperor and his family amid doubts expressed by the @entity7 as to their authenticity			1
the bones which are believed to belong to murdered @entity16 , his empress @entity11 and three of their children were dug up in 1991 and are now buried in a crypt in @entity18			1
the famous ruler was forced to abdicate his throne during the @entity21 in 1917 before he and his family were exiled to western - @entity22 by the @entity24 revolutionaries that overthrew him			1
and on 17 july 1918 , the @entity4 royals were marched into a cellar and mercilessly shot by firing squad on the orders of @entity30 founder @entity29			2
the proposal to exhume their remains was backed this week by a pretender to the @entity36 throne and a senior official in @entity39 's government			2
the @entity40 : there is growing pressure on the @entity4 government to dig up the bodies of @entity22 's last emperor @entity16 ( pictured ) , his wife @entity47 ( centre ) and daughters @entity50 ( left ) , @entity41 ( top ) and @entity43 ( right ) - his other daughter @entity44 and son @entity46 ( both pictured ) were never buried remains : the skulls of @entity16 ( right ) , his wife @entity47 ( left ) were discovered in 1979 and buried in a crypt in @entity18 in 1998 - along with their daughters @entity50 , @entity41 and @entity43 forgotten : although his sisters @entity50 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) received a state burial at @entity64 , @entity46 's ( centre ) remains were never buried and @entity65 can also reveal that eight years after the discovery of the alleged remains of crown prince @entity46 - brutally shot aged 13 with other members of his family - they have still not been laid to rest			1
instead his bones - and those of his sister @entity73 - lie almost forgotten in cardboard boxes stashed in the @entity4 state archive with @entity39 's government refusing to order a burial in the face of objections from the church			2
many will see this as the final indignity to a boy born to be tsar , pictured here in remarkable private family photographs , who was deprived of his throne by the two @entity4 revolutions of 1917			1
for three hundred years , the @entity40 was regarded by millions of @entity4 as the living embodiment of the @entity4 nation who believed the tsar was appointed by god to rule the empire			2
it is widely believed that his remains and those of his wife , their children and several servants were originally found in a forest near @entity104 in 1979 and subsequently dug up 11 years later as the @entity30 was collapsing			2
exhaustive dna tests were conducted in @entity106 and the @entity107 involving matches with living relatives , including prince @entity110 , after which they were interred in a crypt in the @entity64 in royal capital @entity18 in a 1998 ceremony			1
objections : the @entity7 refuses to accept the opinion of leading dna experts who say the bones are those of the tsar @entity16 ( top left ) , his @entity119 - born empress @entity11 ( bottom right ) and their children concession : a senior official in @entity39 's government @entity124 says ' it is necessary to listen to the church ' and dig up the royal family 's remains			1
pictured are the remains of @entity46 and his sister @entity44 , 19 , discovered in 2007 and still have not been buried the @entity24 justified the @entity36 's murder by claiming their royal relatives were supporting the ' white armies ' - as @entity16 's cousin was @entity136 of @entity106			1
before murdering them , the chief executioner @entity137 said : ' in view of the fact that your relatives in @entity143 are continuing their assault on @entity22 , the presidium of the @entity146 @entity30 had sentenced you to be shot			0
' now grand duchess @entity148 - a claimant to the defunct throne - has made clear the @entity4 @entity150 would not oppose exhuming the remains of the tsar and four other members of his family if deemed necessary by @entity39 's government and the @entity7			1
@entity124 , the senior archivist under @entity39 , said on @entity156 : ' to find out the truth it is necessary to listen to the church representatives and exhume the remains that were buried in @entity64			0
' behind the controversy is the @entity7 's refusal to accept the opinion of a host of leading dna experts in @entity22 and the @entity166 who say the bones originally found buried in 1979 in the @entity170 forest are those of the tsar @entity16 , his @entity119 - born empress @entity11 and their children			1
despite the bones being interred in 1998 close to other @entity36 rulers at a ceremony when tsar lookalike prince @entity177 represented the @entity178 , the @entity4 church has refused to accept they are unequivocally the right bones			0
the discovery of two further sets of small fragments of male and female human remains in 2007 - shown by dna tests to be haemophiliac @entity46 and his sister @entity44 , 19 - added to the historical mystery			1
the church refused to bury them with the rest of their family , claiming the scientific proof was insufficient , yet genetic experts say it is ' 80 trillion times more likely ' that the male 's bones were @entity46 's than not			1
regal : for three hundred years , the @entity40 - eventually led by @entity16 - was regarded by millions of @entity4 as the living embodiment of the @entity4 nation taken : had history taken a different route and the @entity36 's not been executed , @entity46 ( pictured ) would have become @entity200 and @entity201 of @entity22 - as well as head of the @entity7 ironically had history taken a different route , @entity46 would have become @entity200 and @entity201 of all the @entity22 's - as well as head of the @entity7			1
lawyer for the @entity4 @entity150 , @entity207 , said that if the @entity4 government requires it the @entity36 's descendants would ' not be against further examination ' of the bones			1
he said : ' it is crucially important to consider the opinion of the @entity7 about possible exhumation , and for society to come to an agreement on this			0
' grand duchess @entity148 will support the opinion of @entity7			0
' senior official @entity124 said further tests on the bones should be carried out with experts trusted by the church			0
he was ' strongly against ' burying the supposed remains of the crown prince and his sister without new tests which satisfy the @entity4 church			2
church representative @entity227 said there was an understandable desire ' to bury the remains which are now stored in an office ' at the archive			0
cover up : regarding the buried bones , a church representative said : ' many people would like to know the truth - and suspect that the truth is hidden from them ' but added : ' many people would like to know the truth - and suspect that the truth is hidden from them			0
' i think that we should allow a wide range of competent experts , and not necessarily only the @entity7 , to the study of all available remains			2
' in 2011 , the @entity247 - its equivalent of the @entity250 - completed a probe into the royal deaths , and concluded based on dna evidence that the bodies found in the @entity170 were genuine , including @entity46 and @entity44			1
along with the remains of the 50 year old tsar were his 46 year - old wife @entity256 , their daughters @entity50 , 22 , @entity258 , 21 , and @entity43 , 17			0
the dismembered bodies of their servants @entity262 , 53 , @entity263 , aged 40 , @entity264 , aged 62 , and @entity265 , aged 48 were also there - while @entity46 and @entity44 's bodies were dumped 230ft away			1
the church - and some @entity36 relatives - have accepted an earlier @entity271 investigator called @entity273 's account that the royals were disposed of at another location , at a nearby abandoned iron mine at @entity277			0
they were supposed to have been stripped and burned to ashes			0
proof : in 2011 , the @entity247 concluded on dna evidence that the @entity36 bodies found in the @entity170 were genuine doomed : within a year of this photo being taken , the @entity4 revolution swept across the country and forced @entity16 to abdicate however others contend that while they were originally thrown into @entity288 , the royals were later removed to a new burial place by the @entity24 to hide them from the @entity271 forces which soon retook the area			1
the church also points to a dna test which failed to find a match between a handkerchief stained with @entity16 's blood during an assassination attempt in @entity298 before he became tsar			2
they stress the bones said to be the tsar 's did not show marks from a sword wound in this attack			0
the scientists leading the identification of the tsar and his family were @entity310 of the @entity311 in @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 of the @entity315 in @entity1 and @entity316 of the @entity317 in @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity107			0
the analysis showed a match between the @entity47 and prince @entity110			0
a common female ancestor of both was queen @entity324			0
' the dna testing was clear and convincing , ' said @entity316			0
proof : in 2011 , the @entity247 completed a probe into the royal deaths and concluded based on dna evidence that the bodies found in the @entity170 did belong to @entity16 ( left ) and his family when the other remains were found in 2007 , analysis only confirmed the previous findings , say the scientists			1
when the boy 's y chromosome was compared with the bones believed to be his father @entity16 's and a living donor @entity36 who also descended from @entity342 - they matched			2
finally , a blood sample from a shirt worn by @entity16 during the @entity298 attack - stashed in a @entity18 museum - showed matching dna			1
church sources say they require 100 per cent certainty			0
the @entity227 said it was important not only genetically match a particular individual fragment remains with other members of the @entity40 , but also to consider the integrity of the skeletons , and whether ' they all correspond to each other genetically '			0
the lack of a sword wound led to doubts , he said			0
a final decision on exhumation would rest with president @entity39 .			0

@entity7 and family 's descendants calling for bodies to be dug up
@entity16 was forced to abdicate by @entity4 revolutionaries in 1917
he and his family were exiled from their home and executed one year later
their bodies were discovered in 1979 and now rest in a @entity18 crypt
remains of @entity16 ' son @entity46 and daughter @entity44 have yet to be buried
@entity7 refuses to believe dna experts who said bodies belong to royals
