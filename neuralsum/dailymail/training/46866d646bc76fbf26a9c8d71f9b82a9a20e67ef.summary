a @entity2 mp 's latest attempt to ban the burqa across the state has been branded anti-islamic and a political stunt			1
@entity8 leader @entity7 introduced his private member 's bill in state parliament on thursday that would prohibit the wearing of the burqa and other face coverings in public			1
it follows similar bans in @entity17 and @entity18 , and comes after his failed attempt at blacklisting face coverings in 2010			2
@entity8 mp @entity7 has introduced a bill that would see the ban of burqas while mr @entity7 stressed that his bill 's text did not include the words ' burqa ' or ' muslim ' , much of his speech to parliament about the plan focused on the burqa			1
he said the measures came at an ' opportune ' time after wednesday 's arrest in @entity35 of two men allegedly linked to terrorist groups in @entity38			1
' we also face the new @entity41 ( is ) terrorist threat , whose black uniforms for both men and women include face coverings to prevent identification , ' he told the upper house			2
@entity50 mp @entity49 said the measures were ' anti-islamic ' and had more to do with mr @entity7 's bid for re-election in march			1
his political opponents , like @entity50 mp @entity49 , said the measures were ' anti-islamic ' ' these measures are the opposite of everything we 're trying to achieve in @entity60 in terms of being inclusive and having a harmonious society where we respect difference , ' she told @entity64			2
@entity65 , from @entity66 , branded the move as ' unfortunate '			0
' [ this ] is only going to further traumatise members of the [ @entity28 ] community who are absolutely innocent and have every right to wear the fashion of their choice , " she said			0
under mr @entity7 's plan , a person who covers their face in public would face a $ 550 fine and a person who forces someone else to cover their face would be hit with a $ 1,100 penalty			1
the plan allows faces to be covered under certain conditions , such as during a parade or if ' @entity90 is suddenly hit by a blizzard and ski masks are the latest fashion ' , the mp said			0
@entity95 mp @entity94 said the move was another example of ' conservative men trying to control what women do '			0
mr @entity7 's move comes after two @entity35 men , @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 ( right ) were arrested for charges of terrorism @entity107 , an intelligence and security expert at the @entity110 , said authorities already had powers to ask for face coverings to be removed			1
he said mr @entity7 's plan was unlikely to be supported by the security community			1
comment has been sought from @entity2 premier @entity116			0
debate on the bill was adjourned			2
it comes as two @entity35 men were charged on wednesday for preparing to send fighters to join the conflict in @entity38 after a raid on a @entity125 bookstore , a gym and seven other premises in @entity128 and @entity129			0
the arrests followed a year - long counter-terrorism investigation by @entity132 and state police			0
@entity134 , who is the brother of @entity60 's first suicide bomber to die in @entity38 , was charged with providing funds to the terrorist organisation @entity137			2
the 31 - year - old , from @entity139 , was also charged with preparing for incursions into @entity38			0
further , @entity103 , 21 , from @entity141 , was charged with preparing for incursions into @entity38 with the intention of engaging in hostile activities as well as recruiting fighters to join the conflict .			0
