@entity0 is set to bring its $ 35 @entity2 dongle to hifi systems			1
the firm today revealed a major new push into audio designed to take on @entity7			2
it plans to partner with hifi firms to create speakers for the service , and today revealed it will already work with speakers connected to a tv			1
however , key services , including @entity34 , are currently missing			0
currently the system allows people to play back video from sites such as @entity39			0
however , @entity0 is now bringing the same technology behind its popular $ 35 @entity41 into speakers , soundbars and a / v receivers			1
it says users will be able to ' cast ' audio wirelessly from a variety of apps on your @entity50 or @entity51 smartphone , or the @entity53 , in a similar fashion to the way people with a @entity2 stream video			1
' just like @entity2 , simply tap the cast button in your favorite music or radio app on @entity50 , @entity51 , or the web , and select a @entity63 speaker to get the party started			1
' similar to the video service , users can use their phone to control the music , which is then played directly through the speaker from cloud services , meaning they can use their phone for other things			1
' @entity63 speakers pull content directly from the cloud , so you ’ll get the best audio quality and can freely multi-task on your phone , tablet , or laptop , all without straining the battery , ' it says			1
the service is available from today , and @entity0 's speakers will work with a growing list of apps including @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and doznes more			1
the $ 35 gadget , which resembles a usb stick , is plugged directly into the @entity92 port on modern tvs and streams content from the web , via peoples phones , tablets and laptops			0
all this content is controlled via apps , and the @entity102 version of the stick currently features content from the @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity39 , while the @entity107 version has a host of apps			0
@entity2 is a direct competitor to the @entity7 system that was launched by the @entity113 company in 2007 , and is now in its third generation			0
it also rivals the streaming box services of @entity117			0
by comparison , @entity117 boxes start at £ 60 ( $ 99 ) , while the @entity7 device sells for £ 99 in the @entity121 and $ 99 in the @entity107 @entity2 is compatible with @entity50 smartphones and tablets , as well as @entity124 and @entity7 's @entity51 operating system			0
however , some major streaming services , including @entity34 , are currently missing from the list			0
@entity0 intends to broaden the @entity63 ecosystem over the coming months by bringing it into more televisions , game consoles , and set - top boxes with @entity50 tv			2
the company is also working to enable other non-audio apps to enhance the experience by supporting @entity63 audio devices			2
for example , you might be able to see a video on a tablet , but hear the audio on a set of bedroom speakers .			2

will allow users to ' cast ' audio to compatible speakers and hifi systems
