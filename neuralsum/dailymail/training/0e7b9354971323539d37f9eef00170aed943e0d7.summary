by @entity0 @entity1 and five others are facing prison for their roles in what prosecutors called a ‘ pervasive ’ culture of phone hacking at the @entity9			1
under mr @entity1 ’s editorship , the phone messages of actors , celebrities , and politicians were intercepted on ‘ an industrial scale ’			1
police identified 4,000 possible victims			1
the hacking scandal began to unravel in 2007 , when royal reporter @entity19 and private investigator @entity20 were jailed for intercepting the voicemails of members of the @entity23			1
but that defence crumbled after emails disclosed in a series of civil actions for damages exposed a wider conspiracy			0
by last october – at the start of this trial – the scale of the hacking plot became clear when the @entity46 was told that three former news editors at the newspaper were among five men who pleaded guilty to their part in the hacking plot			2
senior executives @entity52 , 64 , @entity54 , 58 , and @entity55 , 52 , all admitted playing a part in a six - year campaign of phone hacking which targeted politicians , pop stars and members of the @entity62			1
@entity20 , 43 , who was paid £ 100,000 a year by the paper to arrange the hacking , admitted intercepting the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl @entity66 , among a host of other victims			2
close friends : event : @entity72 , @entity73 , with @entity1 and his wife @entity74 in 2009			2
the court heard how @entity73 and @entity1 had a series of affairs at an earlier hearing , he also admitted three counts of conspiracy to commit phone hacking after police found ‘ thousands and thousands of pages ’ of notes relating to his victims			1
and reporter @entity88 , who appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the hacking trial , confessed to hacking @entity93 ’s messages on actor @entity95 ’s phone			1
he has admitted conspiracy to hack phones at the @entity98 between february 2003 and january 2005 , and the same offence at the @entity9 between april 2004 and june 2010			1
he also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice			2
they will be sentenced alongside @entity1 after he was found guilty yesterday of conspiring to hack phones			1
targets : actors @entity108 and @entity93 's phones were hacked ( pictured in 2004 ) they each face a maximum sentence of two years for the phone hacking			1
the former @entity27 editor , whose affair with mrs @entity72 was sensationally revealed during the trial when excerpts from a deeply personal letter from his co-defendant were read to the jury , will face sentencing shortly after the trial finally ends			2
at that point , it is likely that @entity124 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity20 will be brought back to court to be told their fate			0
the jury heard that phone hacking was so widespread at the @entity9 that senior journalists even used a special hotline for ‘ do - it - yourself hacking ’ and targeted rival journalists			1
celebrities who were hacked include sir @entity134 and his then wife @entity135 , as well as @entity108 and @entity93 , his girlfriend at the time			0
@entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 were targeted too			0
@entity20 admitted recording voicemail messages belonging to former home secretary @entity142 and @entity144 nanny @entity143 , who was convicted of killing a child in the @entity146 in the 1990s			0
news @entity144 – the @entity144 newspaper publishing arm of @entity150 ’s media empire – said it had put in place measures to ensure that the wrongdoing at the @entity9 could not happen again			1
‘ we said long ago , and repeat today , that wrongdoing occurred , and we apologised for it			0
‘ we have been paying compensation to those affected and have co-operated with investigations , ’ the company said			0
‘ we made changes in the way we do business to help ensure wrongdoing like this does not occur again			0
’ @entity166 from lobby group @entity165 , which campaigns for state - imposed regulation of the @entity169 , said : ‘ for years the @entity150 press clung to the story that one rogue reporter was responsible for phone hacking			1
we now know this was a lie			0
‘ far from being an isolated incident involving a few “ bad apples ” , the trial has shown that the entire orchard was rotten			0
’ by @entity179 guilty verdict : @entity1 at the @entity46 on tuesday @entity181 endured searching new questions yesterday over the failure of officials to vet disgraced spin doctor @entity1 to the highest level			1
@entity1 – who became @entity187 ’s chief spin doctor in 2010 – was not security - vetted to the same level as his predecessors and successors			1
instead , the former tabloid editor was vetted to ‘ security check ’ level , which allows only supervised access to the most secret government documents			0
he resigned before a stricter ‘ developed vetting ( @entity198 ) ’ clearance process had been completed			0
of the @entity187 communications directors before @entity1 , three were already vetted to the @entity198 level , two others were granted the status three months after starting the job and another after seven months			2
mr @entity181 and chancellor @entity205 hired @entity1 as the @entity206 ’ director of communications only weeks after he quit the @entity9 in 2007 , saying he took ‘ ultimate responsibility ’ when royal editor @entity19 pleaded guilty to phone hacking			1
labour leader @entity210 revelled in @entity1 ’s downfall yesterday and asked why he had not gone through the full vetting process earlier			1
mr @entity210 said : ‘ i think @entity181 must do much more than an apology			0
he owes the country an explanation for why he did not act on these allegations against @entity1 , why – as the evidence piled up – he did n’t do anything about			2
‘ he does n’t seem to have received the most comprehensive security vetting and clearance			0
we need to know why that did n’t happen			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s background had been probed by a private company contracted by the @entity206 when he began work as its head of communications in 2007			1
but it was decided to commence ‘ developed vetting ’ of mr @entity1 only after he had to brief the media on a terror alert at the @entity233 in october 2010			2
this had not been completed when @entity1 resigned in january 2011			2
under mr @entity181 ’s premiership , current director of communications @entity235 has been develop vetted , as has @entity237 – @entity1 ’s deputy			2
no 10 pointed out that @entity239 concluded in his inquiry report that the @entity241 decides what levels of security clearance staff require			0
last night @entity246 ’s spin doctor @entity245 , who resigned over a smear campaign against opponents , attacked the @entity249 for ’ equating my behaviour – however reprehensible – with the criminal activities for which @entity1 has just been convicted ’			1
he added : ‘ i had to undergo the developed vetting process , and have my finances , love life and past activities thoroughly looked through by the security services			0
i was not allowed to start doing the job properly until i ’d received my @entity198 status			0
‘ why was @entity1 not put through developed vetting for the director of communications job in @entity29 ? ’ but @entity263 sources said it was unlikely a ‘ developed vetting ’ process would have uncovered any fresh evidence about @entity1 and phone hacking			1
the @entity206 leadership had been dreading the conclusion of the @entity1 trial for months , since mr @entity181 had vowed to make a full public apology if he was convicted			1
mr @entity181 admitted at the @entity273 that his decision to hire @entity1 had ‘ haunted ’ them both			2
@entity1 , however , insisted the question of voicemail interception was raised only once by mr @entity181 during his recruitment – in a phone call while he was on holiday in @entity281			2
@entity187 said @entity1 had given assurances to the police , @entity283 and a commons select committee that he knew nothing of hacking			1
mr @entity205 said : ‘ i too am very sorry for the decision we made to employ @entity1			0
he gave us assurances that turned out not to be the case			0
we gave him a second chance but , knowing what we now know , it ’s clear that we made the wrong decision			0
’ mr @entity298 said he warned mr @entity181 about the hiring of @entity1			0
he said he took the pm to one side when the @entity302 was formed in 2010 and questioned why @entity1 was a @entity187 communications director .			0

@entity304 doctor @entity1 found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones
phone hacking took place while he was the editor of the @entity9
police identified 4,000 possible victims of phone hacking by @entity314
three senior executives , reporter and private investigator could face jail
