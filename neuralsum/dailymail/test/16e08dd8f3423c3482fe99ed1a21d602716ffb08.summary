@entity0 would sell coveted winger @entity1 for ' £ 40million to £ 60million ' , according to manager @entity2			1
@entity2 claims all his players are ' undervalued ' as the @entity5 club bid to assert their @entity7 clout			1
the former @entity9 boss is ready to fend off big - money bids for his in - demand stars like @entity1 and defender @entity12 - but conceded ' every player has a price '			1
@entity2 says he would sell @entity1 if @entity0 were offered £ 40 - 60million @entity1 has been in fine form in recent weeks as @entity0 have enjoyed a successful second half of the season @entity18 star @entity1 joined @entity0 for around £ 400,000 from @entity19 in 2012 but has risen steadily in standing ever since			1
last week @entity2 slapped a £ 20m price tag on the 25 - year - old 's head with @entity23 circling - now he has casually bandied about figures three times as high			1
' i 'll sell @entity1 , if someone wants to give me £ 40m to £ 60m , somewhere in there , that would be good , ' @entity2 said			1
' i 'll take it and we 'll build the team around that money			0
every player has a price , of course			2
all these players here are undervalued , in my opinion			0
' this is a top - 10 team at the moment , top 12 , yet if you put the valuation of our squad against any of the other teams above us , and some below , it 's not right			2
' so i 'm going to address that			0
anyone who rings me up will get a proper price			0
it 's only our second year in the @entity7 so it 's understandable ( if players are undervalued )			0
@entity1 celebrates after netting for @entity0 , as he has begun to add goalscoring to his all - round game @entity1 scored a hat - trick against @entity57 a few weeks ago , and is attracting the attention of top clubs ' you need to put your credentials there every week			1
i think these players are starting to do that now ; @entity1 , ( @entity66 ) @entity65 , ( @entity68 ) @entity67 , ( @entity70 ) @entity69			2
' therefore when i hear figures being talked about players , they are not even close to where i value these players			0
' it 's very easy to address : a manager has to ring me up and i will tell him the price , and that will be addressed			2
' @entity78 - born @entity1 bagged a hat - trick in @entity0 's 4 - 1 @entity7 win at @entity57 on april 11 , his fine form since prompting a raft of transfer speculation			1
@entity23 's initial plans to offer £ 10million this summer have been thwarted , but boss @entity85 is weighing up offering striker @entity86 as well as increasing his transfer bid			0
@entity2 says he is not keen to lose his star man , but would sell him if the right offer came in @entity2 insists several of his players , including @entity65 ( left ) and @entity67 , are undervalued while @entity2 will be at pains to hold onto all his front - line talents at @entity0 over the summer , the @entity92 midfielder conceded the club may not be able to resist an outrageous bid			1
@entity2 said @entity0 could end up wise to repeat the calculated ' gamble ' he helped take at @entity9 when the @entity99 club sold @entity100 to @entity23 for £ 35million in 2011			1
the @entity5 manager believes selling one star for big money can help rejuvenate an entire squad			2
' i can think of a situation i had at @entity9 , the last day of the window , a team that was n't great , not too far away from the relegation zone and we accepted a big bid for @entity100 , ' @entity2 said			2
' i said to the chairman at the time that that was a gamble			0
we were by no means secure ; we 'd only just come up from the @entity115 that year			0
' but we did it , we spent the money wisely and we ended up with a very , very good team			0
so it is about the right price for the right player , and then you have to build on that			0

@entity2 insists every player has a price , even @entity1
but @entity2 says £ 20m price tag on @entity1 is too low
the @entity0 manager says his whole squad is under - valued
