the refusal of the @entity2 government to pay the $ 132 million ransom demanded by @entity6 's @entity5 captors has exposed the grubby payments that compliant @entity9 nations make for their kidnapped citizens around the world			1
because while the @entity2 and the @entity14 categorically do not negotiate with terrorists and present a united front , their @entity13 allies frequently enter clandestine talks and have paid millions to get their people home			1
this year alone @entity5 and @entity19 are believed to have received ransom payments for three @entity22 journalists released in april , and four @entity24 journalists who were freed two weeks later			1

just today , @entity46 , the @entity2 defense secretary called @entity5 ' well funded ' , no doubt as a result of their activities in extorting money in ransom from @entity9 governments ' @entity5 is as well funded and sophisticated a group we have seen ... this is beyond anything we have ever seen '			1
france $ 58.1m @entity57 and oman $ 20.4m switzerland $ 12.4m @entity22 $ 11m austria $ 3.2m according to the @entity59 it wants to emulate the business model of @entity19 who have raked in upwards of $ 125 million over the last five years in ransom - - mostly from @entity9 nations			1
according to a statement by the @entity67 in june , ransom payments are now the second largest source of income for terrorist groups , after state sponsorship			1
but all anti-terrorism experts agree that the paying ransoms perpetuates the problem of hostages			0
more so , it means that @entity2 's stance on non-negotiation is undermined and means @entity2 face never be released without the use of force			2
flow of terror funds : @entity83 , @entity24 , @entity84 and @entity22 are accused of paying ransoms to terrorist groups along with @entity57 and @entity87 the leader of @entity89 has even described kidnappings as ' an easy spoil ' giving swift income to his terror network			1
' thanks to @entity97 , most of the battle costs , if not all , were paid from through the spoils , ' the newspaper quoted him as saying			0
' kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil , which i may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure			0
' the most prominent case - involving by far the most money - was that of four @entity24 nuclear firm employees who stunned the world when they were returned unharmed after three years in captivity			0
@entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 were captured in september 2010 while working on a uranium mine in northern @entity115			0
their touchdown at a military airport near @entity119 in october , where they were met by president @entity121 , prompted world headlines amid claims a heavy price had been paid			0
the @entity24 government insisted it used diplomacy to free the four men , with defence minister @entity128 saying : ‘ @entity24 has held the same position for the past three years - we do n’t pay			0
' but the @entity24 newspaper @entity130 , renowned for its secret service contacts , reported the country 's intelligence agencies paid 20million euros or $ 28 million for their release			1
the @entity59 investigation puts this figure far higher - at 30million euros or $ 39 million which it is claimed was paid by a state - owned company			2
snatched : @entity6 was taken by an armed gang in @entity141 on @entity142 in 2012			2
he was then held with other journalists in terrible conditions			0
they spoke out about the harsh treatment @entity6 endured the @entity59 also claims @entity24 paid @entity89 12.5million euros or $ 16 million in 2011 to free three hostages from @entity24 , @entity148 and @entity149			1
the total - $ 58 million - means @entity24 's payments were almost than triple those of the next - highest payer , @entity57 and @entity87 with $ 19.9 million			2
@entity83 also paid $ 12,11 million , @entity22 paid $ 10.78 million and @entity84 paid $ 3.15 million , while the source of another $ 21.57 million in ransom money could not be determined			1
indeed , according to recently released prisoners , their @entity5 captors were extremely aware of their prisoners monetary value , as judged by their nationality			2
it was six weeks after a failed july 4 mission to rescue @entity6 authorized by president @entity163 involving ' nearly every @entity2 military service ' that his captors sent his family and the @entity2 government a $ 132 million ransom demand			1
as well as money , the terror group had also requested the release of @entity172 , an @entity173 graduate and @entity175 neuroscientist with ties to @entity89 currently locked up in @entity177			0
over the nearly two years he was hostage , @entity6 's parents received numerous financial demands to secure his release			2
his family were explicitly told by the government to not discuss the ransom demands with the press nor to name @entity5 as his kidnappers			2
according to @entity188 journalist , @entity187 , @entity6 believed he would ultimately be freed by his own government			0
' @entity6 believed that his government would help him , ' says @entity187 according to the wrap			0
' in a message that was not made public , @entity6 said that he believed so strongly that @entity193 would help that he refused to allow his fellow @entity2 captives to not believe in their government			1
' @entity30 : it has emerged that @entity5 demanded a staggering $ 132m ransom for the return of @entity6			1
@entity200 , the ceo and co-founder of @entity202 , the @entity204 - based website that @entity6 was reporting for when he was captured told @entity199 it was considerably higher than for @entity9 captives ' purely because he was an @entity2 his former boss , @entity202 co-founder and ceo @entity200 told @entity208 on wednesday that he spent millions trying to secure his reporter 's release			1
' you know when you kidnap someone and hold them for almost two years , you do n't do it unless you believe there is value in those hostages			0
' ' we received an email from the captors on wednesday night of last week stating their intention to execute @entity223 , ' @entity200 said			0
' the email was full of rage			0
we pleaded with the captors for mercy , but to no avail			0
' now , the failure to free @entity6 or negotiate his release has backed the president into a corner as he deals with the threat to kill the second hostage paraded in front of the camera on tuesday , @entity237			2
indeed , at the end of tuesday 's grisly video , @entity6 's executioner , who is widely believed to be @entity14 , delivers an ominous threat towards the @entity243			0
' the life of this @entity2 citizen , @entity163 , depends on your next decision , ' sick propaganda : @entity6 was forced to say in the beheading video : ' think about what you are doing			1
think about the lives you destroy , including those of your own family , ' before he was murdered inspiration : @entity256 and @entity257 , told reporters outside their home in @entity260 on wednesday how @entity6 was inspired to report in war zones because of his brothers in the military the policy of non-negotiation , which the @entity2 shares with @entity14 , now puts it increasingly at odds with many of it @entity13 partners			1
in an opinion piece for @entity188 , @entity187 , who works for the news agency argues that by launching a mission and not paying the ransom contributed to @entity6 's death			2
' the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows			0
it must be publicly debated , ' wrote mr. @entity187 , who escaped from the @entity280 himself by climbing out of a window			0
' @entity2 and @entity9 policy makers should be forced to answer for their actions			1
