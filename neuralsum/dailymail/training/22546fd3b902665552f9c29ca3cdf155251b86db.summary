this is the bittersweet moment a loving girlfriend married her terminally - ill husband on his hospital bed			1
@entity4 , 22 , said ' i do ' to @entity6 , 23 , as he lay in @entity7 , suffering from incurable bowel cancer			1
@entity6 was able to make it out of his bed to celebrate the ' perfect ' day afterwards with his new wife , while their two children @entity14 , two , and @entity15 , four months , looked on			1
ceremony : @entity6 married @entity4 in a ceremony at @entity7 yesterday he was admitted to hospital in november after suffering for several weeks with what he thought at first were stomach cramps			1
but after being admitted to hospital on 11 november , doctors found a large tumour in his bowels			1
although they were able to remove it , further tests showed that the cancer had spread and @entity6 had only weeks to live			1
after finding out last week that the cancer is terminal , @entity6 and @entity4 decided to marry as soon as possible , and invited their friends and family to a ceremony conducted by the hospital chaplain yesterday			1
' it was perfect ' : the two were married in a ceremony at @entity7 , where @entity6 has been since november speaking to @entity37 tonight , @entity4 said : ' after a second operation last friday they discovered that the cancer had spread everywhere			1
that 's it now , there ’s no stopping it			0
' when they told us i had to leave the room – it was too much to take it			2
' after it all settled down and we got our heads round it as much as we could , @entity6 just said he wanted to get married as soon as we could			1
we arranged it for yesterday			0
' it was crazy because we were really happy , but it was so emotional			0
' it was a lovely day and we ’ve been thinking about it today , saying “ it was perfect and it could n’t have gone any better ”			0
' we had talked about getting married even before he was ill - and when we found out the cancer was terminal we wanted to do it straight away			1
' @entity6 managed to get out of bed and we went over the the social club and had a ceremony – the chaplain from the hospital came over and gave us a blessing			2
' ' it was a really nice day and everyone really helped us out			0
all of our family was there and a lot of our friends			2
' @entity6 , who is also known as @entity76 , met through mutual friends in @entity78 , @entity79 , in august 2010			1
they quickly fell for one another and within a year the couple had moved in together and @entity4 was pregnant with her first child , @entity14			1
@entity4 , a hairdresser , and @entity6 , who works for a water supply company , lived happily together for two years and had a second child , @entity15 , who is now four months old			1
but only weeks after his second child was born , @entity6 was struck with awful stomach pains and could n't make it to work			1
but when the couple visited the hospital and called doctors , they were repeatedly told that @entity6 was not seriously ill. terminal : @entity6 found out his cancer was fatal last friday and the couple , parents to two young children , wanted to get married as soon as possible their concerns were ignored despite the fact that three of @entity6 's family members have recently died of bowel cancer - his mother and grandfather last year , and his aunt in 2007			1
@entity4 said : ' he was ill two weeks prior to being taken in to hospital , we kept going up there and they kept turning us away , saying it was a bug			2
' we had three ambulances out			0
we rang 111 and we told him all his symptoms , and they sent ambulances			0
twice they took us to hospital			0
' once they said it was a kidney infection , another time they said it was irritable bowels and one of the other times they did n’t even take us to the hospital because they said there was nothing wrong with him			0
' in @entity132 they said it was a sickness bug			0
i told him he has a family history of bowel cancer , but they just were n’t interested			1
he finally got taken in on the 11 november			1
up and about : @entity6 was able to leave his hospital bed to cut a wedding cake and kiss his bride in front of friends and family ' finally we went to a medial centre and we said we ’re not going anywhere until we know what ’s wrong with him			1
' we ’re not being fobbed off again and again – we basically said to people at the hospital and said we ’re not going anywhere until it ’s sorted			0
' then a surgeon had a feel of his tummy and could feel something in his bowels , and that ’s when they did the ct scan and found it was cancer			2
' it was awful finding out – we ’ve got two small children			0
he ’s been in hospital since			0
in the four weeks since he had his tumour removed the cancer spread quite far			2
' but despite being struck by such a desperate illness , @entity6 's thoughts remained with his young family throughout - and how he would provide for them			1
@entity4 said : ' he ’s quite a family man , he insists he brings the money in			2
so he went to work two or three times while he was ill , but could n’t really do much , because he had major stomach cramps which would go and come back proud father : @entity177 before he was hospitalised , holding his son @entity14 , left , and baby daughter @entity15 young love : @entity6 and @entity4 met in 2010 and have two children together , @entity14 , aged two , and @entity15 , four months ' for the last couple of days before he went to hospital he was just in bed all day and did n’t eat for two weeks			1
' @entity6 ’s best friend @entity186 – when he went into hospital he was really concerned about money , as he has a family and a house to keep up			1
big day : @entity4 in her wedding dress outside of the hospital ' that was the only thing he was talking about before his first op , saying he wanted to make money for us			2
' then @entity186 started to @entity198 website , with a little bit about what ’s going on			2
it ’s now raised more than £ 7,000			0
' it ’s lovely – i ’ve had so many people message me saying they ’re thinking of me and i do n’t even know them			0
' @entity6 is really comfortable at the moment			2
he ’s got his head round everything and just wants to spend time with the kids , me and his family			0
' he ’s been really really positive , and is trying to think of the kids			0
' he does n’t want to get upset in front of the kids , he does n’t want to let them know what ’s going on			0
' especially @entity14 , who is starting to understand that his dad ’s in hospital			2
' but he ’s been really positive , and since finding out it ’s terminally he ’s been exceptionally brave			0
' the kids and i will be in the hospital on christmas day			0
' @entity15 is too young to know what ’s going on , but @entity14 sort of understands			1
