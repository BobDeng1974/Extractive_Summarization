by @entity1 reporter published : 06:31 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 06:31 est , 27 april 2013 scientists claim they have discovered how birds find their way across thousands of miles of land guided by the earth 's magnetic field			1
it seems beneath the feathers they are equipped with an internal navigation system similar to the gadgets used by comic superhero @entity13			1
sensory neurons called hair cells are found inside the ears and they are responsible for detecting sound and gravity			1
migrating : a flock of cranes fly 200 kilometres east of @entity21			0
scientists are baffled how birds always fly to the same location and even the same nest to the surprise of @entity29 and @entity30 scientists each cell has a single iron ball , which is up to 2,000 times small than the width of a human hair , in the same place as every cell			1
the researchers believe that the iron responds much like a compass - known as magnetoreceptors - to help birds know whether they are flying north or south , the position of the sun and visual maps to help them find their way			2
hair cells are also involved in hearing and balance in most animals , so the researchers believe the iron may help the birds ' sense ' the magnetic field , reports the @entity53			1
phd student @entity54 , from the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) in @entity56 , said : ' it 's very exciting			0
research : the image shows cells from the inner ear of pigeons stained with a chemical that turns iron bright blue in colour			2
it highlights the balls of iron discovered by the @entity71 lab. each one lies directly beneath the hairs and there is just one per cell ' we find these iron balls in every bird , whether it 's a pigeon or an ostrich , but not in humans			2
' but @entity55 group leader dr @entity71 told the paper : ' we 're a long way off understanding how magnetic sensing works - we still do n't know what these mysterious iron balls are doing			0

balls of iron are found directly beneath the hairs and may play a role in magnetic detection ' who knows ? perhaps they are the elusive magnetoreceptors			0
' dr @entity71 examined zebra finches , ducks , chickens , ostriches and budgerigars and found iron spheres in hair cells in each of their inner ears			1
each cell contained just iron ball			0
but they could not find any iron granules in the hair cells of mammals like mice , guinea pigs , humans and even fish			1
for decades experts have been puzzled how birds migrate a mass movement along a ' flyway ' between wintering and breeding grounds , thousands of miles in formation , often returning to the same location and even the same nest year after year			1
@entity127 fly 44,000 miles per year when they travel from their breeding grounds to their feeding grounds in the @entity130			0
@entity131 fly up to 40,000 miles each year from their home in the @entity133 to the @entity134 where they feed in the summer			0
@entity137 birds , including sparrows and cuckoos migrate south for the winter , travelling hundreds of miles over the @entity142 desert			2
the latest study published in the online version of @entity145 , builds on previous work by the @entity148 lab at @entity55 and the @entity149 's @entity150 ( @entity150 )			0
last year the collaboration showed that iron - rich cells in the beak of pigeons - previously believed to be the magnetic sensors - were just blood cells			2
@entity150 research associate dr @entity157 , who has studied iron in a range of animals from molluscs to humans , said it was an astonishing finding			0
superhero : birds apparently have an internal navigation system similar to the gadgets used by @entity13 dr @entity157 said : ' despite decades of research , these conspicuous balls of iron had never been observed previously			1
' nature keeps surprising us with the various ways iron can be utilised by animals			0
" the scientists are now planning to investigate if the iron spheres react when moving through a magnetic field .			0

scientists have been baffled for decades about how birds migrate every year to the same place and even the same nest
