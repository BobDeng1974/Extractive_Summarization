this exclusive photograph shows @entity1 , 46 , who was gunned down in an apparent contract hit , learning to walk again in a privately funded room at an @entity15 hospital			1
he revealed that he faces major new surgery this week on his wounds – but hopes to be discharged in about a month			1
yet his determination to remain in @entity19 could potentially run up a huge bill for the taxpayer in police protection			2
‘ they wanted me dead but now i ’m walking , ’ he told @entity23			2
‘ i can now manage about a third of a mile if i stay on the same level , and even climb 20 steps			2
’ a wound in his abdomen , where he was sprayed with bullets , will be treated during the latest operation			2
he attributed his progress to the care of ‘ the best medics in the world ’ in an @entity15 hospital that can not be identified			0
the millionaire was treated without charge by the @entity15 for three months before moving into a private room at the same hospital under the care of the same doctors			0
mr @entity1 is guarded round the clock by a @entity45 team who will remain with him for the duration of the investigation			1
‘ i ’ve already changed where i will live and organised a new office , so i will be simply doing the same as before at a different location , ’ he said			0
recalling the shooting , he added : ‘ the bullets started hitting my body and it was very painful			0
i should have avoided moving to that location			0
' it ’s so quiet at night – now i will live in an area where it will be much more difficult to do the same			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s asylum application , along with those of his wife @entity63 , 46 , and son @entity64 , 26 , is pending			1
so are applications from @entity2 @entity66 , 36 , with whom he was living when he was shot , and their baby son			1
safety : the 46 - year - old is claiming political asylum in @entity19 for himself and his family , something which , if granted , could mean huge bills for the @entity19 taxpayer in police protection			0

@entity1 was shot outside his flat in the @entity78 in march
