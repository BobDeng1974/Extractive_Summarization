' profoundly disturbed ' : @entity1 's response to a survey showing over half of @entity4 want out of the euro @entity1 was last night said to be ‘ profoundly disturbed ’ after a poll showed that a majority of @entity4 want to ditch the struggling euro			1
sources in @entity9 said the @entity4 chancellor was shocked by the evidence of growing @entity12 in her country , at a time when @entity4 is under huge pressure to bankroll a rescue of the single currency			2
the poll in a @entity4 newspaper found that 51 per cent of @entity4 think the country should return to the deutschmark			1
it is the first poll to show that more want to leave the euro than stay in it			2
only 29 per cent thought @entity4 would be better off staying inside the 17 - strong eurozone			1
the survey also found that 71 per cent of @entity4 now believe @entity27 should be booted out of the single currency unless it acts on promises to tackle its huge debts			1
mrs @entity1 ’s spokesman said she was ‘ profoundly disturbed ’ by the poll results			0
@entity34 , the president of the @entity36 organisation of eurozone finance ministers , last night risked further inflaming opinion in @entity4 by suggesting @entity9 was treating the eurozone ‘ as its subsidiary ’ and taking decisions solely in its own national interest			0
‘ why is it like this ? ’ he asked			0
mr @entity34 , who is @entity45 ’s prime minister , said there was ‘ no more time to lose ’ in saving the single currency – prompting fresh speculation that the @entity48 is poised to ease the pressure on @entity50 and @entity51 by intervening in the markets to cut their borrowing costs			0
@entity56 president @entity55 , right , and president of the @entity36 and @entity45 's prime minister @entity34 : mr @entity34 has criticised @entity4 politicians @entity60 yesterday joined the voices urging @entity4 to act decisively to end the two - year euro crisis , which is blamed for prolonging the recession in @entity64			1
' no room for further concessions ' : @entity4 finance minister @entity67 says @entity27 's reforms must be carried out to the letter he said @entity4 now had to accept some form of ‘ debt pooling ’ across the eurozone – a move that has been bitterly resisted in @entity9			1
the former prime minister said it was ‘ not surprising ’ that @entity4 are reluctant to pour more money into supporting the euro			2
but he insisted that continuing to allow market confidence to drain from the euro is worse because it is pushing up the cost of rescuing the single currency			0
however , the growing euroscepticism in @entity4 limits mrs @entity1 ’s room for manoeuvre , particularly with national elections due next year			0
economy minister @entity87 seized on the poll results , saying there were ‘ considerable doubts about whether @entity27 is living up to its reform promises ’			0
in a sign of growing global concern about the euro crisis , @entity93 treasury secretary @entity92 flew to @entity4 for talks with @entity4 finance minister @entity67 and @entity48 chief @entity98 yesterday .			2
