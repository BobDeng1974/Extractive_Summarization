by @entity0 the new director of public prosecution , @entity2 , who asserts that claimants are not motivated by financial gain the head of the @entity7 has dismissed claims that women who allege they have been sexually assaulted by celebrities are ‘ money grabbers ’			1
@entity2 , the @entity12 , said it was a myth that claimants were financially motivated and said the public would be ‘ horrified ’ if historic sexual abuse claims did not lead to prosecutions			1
her comments are the first public defence by the head of the @entity7 of two controversial prosecutions of celebrities - the former @entity23 @entity22 and @entity25 star @entity24			1
both mens trials ended in them being acquitted for sexual offences – and said they felt they had been targeted unfairly			2
on being cleared , mr @entity22 described his trial as ‘ a year and a half of hell ’ and said his claimants were ‘ money grabbers ’ , adding ‘ i ’m an easy target			1
’ but mrs @entity2 said victims of sex abuse by celebrities face being castigated as money grabbers when they report allegations			2
she said : ‘ it used to be that if a rape victim wore a short skirt , her credibility was undermined			0
thankfully , we have moved on			0
‘ now we must be careful not to establish new myths that victims come forward only for financial or other motives			0
’ both @entity24 and @entity22 have complained how the spectre of @entity50 has haunted their high profile trials , and criticised the @entity7 for bringing the charges against them			1
@entity22 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) have claimed that the ' spectre of @entity50 has haunted their high profile trials ' , alleging that there has been a witchhunt among the celebrity community prosecutors have been accused of a ‘ witch hunt ’ in the wake of the @entity64 scandal , and veteran @entity65 was cleared on 12 counts of indecent assault just a week after mr @entity24 walked free from court			1
@entity24 ’s acquittal came after his fellow @entity25 star @entity70 was cleared of child sex abuse charges last year following a seven day trail			0
@entity25 star @entity70 was cleared of child sex abuse charges last year following a seven day trail mrs @entity2 took over as @entity12 in october and claims that women who want to come forward are being put off by feelings of shame , a belief that the system is against them and reluctance to face a ‘ deeply invasive ’ trial process			1
in an article for @entity83 , she said historical cases of sexual offences can result in successful prosecutions - and are just as important as recent offences			2
she cited the example of teachers successfully prosecuted and given significant jail terms for sexual abuse crimes committed up to 50 years ago			0
mrs @entity2 also argued that cases of abuse committed historically were just as important as recent offences ‘ because for victims the impact remains to this day			1
’ she added : ‘ so long as our criminal justice system is working , we will continue to see acquittals in these types of cases			0
but we are also seeing convictions			0
’ the @entity7 conviction rate for rape has increased to just over 60 per cent , while for all cases taken to court it is more than 80 per cent , and mrs @entity2 highlighted how difficult it is to convict criminals guilty of sexual crimes			2
after @entity22 ’ acquittal , a spokesman for the @entity7 said : ‘ the @entity7 is now considering whether a retrial will take place and so it would be inappropriate to comment further while proceedings are still active			0

@entity2 says it is a myth that claimants are financially motivated
comments are the first public defence of the celebrity prosecutions
trials of @entity22 and @entity24 both ended in acquittals
@entity126 claims that historic cases are just as important as *modern* ones
