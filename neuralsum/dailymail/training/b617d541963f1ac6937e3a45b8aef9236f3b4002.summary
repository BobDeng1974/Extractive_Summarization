the @entity11 , 40 , said he is prepared to go to @entity8 to face questioning over the claims , but fears @entity13 will turn him over to the @entity3 where he could face espionage and conspiracy charges over revelations by @entity5			1
speaking to the @entity17 from the @entity19 embassy in @entity20 , where he suddenly arrived seeking a last - ditch bid for political asylum last tuesday , he said : ' ultimately it may be a matter of what guarantees the @entity27 , the @entity3 and @entity8 are willing to provide '			1
mr @entity1 believes @entity28 will pursue him after @entity5 published a cache of sensitive documents , including about the @entity32 and @entity33 wars , and thousands of diplomatic cables which have embarrassed governments worldwide			2
he said : ' for example , if the @entity3 were to guarantee ( it would ) drop the grand jury investigation and any further investigation of @entity5 publishing activity , that would be an important guarantee ... diplomatic commitments do have some weight			0
' mr @entity1 has been holed up in the @entity19 embassy to avoid extradition to @entity8 following the failure of a bid to re-open an appeal against his removal from the country			1
mr @entity1 is friendly with the @entity53 country 's socialist leader @entity51 and embassies are regarded as ' safe havens ' which @entity27 police can not enter			0
veteran journalist @entity57 last week said the @entity19 were being very hospitable and had provided mr @entity1 with a ' fairly big room with a computer ' although he would not confirm whether he had been given a bed for his stay			2
@entity19 says he is under its protection while it considers the asylum application			2
he faces arrest for breaching the terms of his bail if he leaves the @entity68 building			0
today a letter signed by high profile campaigner @entity70 and film director @entity72 calling for @entity1 to be granted asylum was handed into the embassy			1
@entity75 , director of just foreign policy - an @entity53 organisation dedicated to reforming @entity3 foreign policy - gave the @entity19 consul @entity79 on the steps of the @entity82 embassy just after 4.30pm			1
mr @entity75 said those who had signed the letter , including radical academic @entity85 and actor @entity86 , were concerned about mr @entity1 ’s fate if his application is rejected			1
' our concern is that if @entity1 is sent to @entity8 that the government of @entity8 maybe send him to the @entity3 where he may be prosecuted under the @entity90 ' mr @entity75 said			1
' many people in the @entity3 are very concerned about this , are very concerned about @entity1 and the @entity3 campaign and hopefully president @entity51 can give him a positive decision in this case '			2
protection : a @entity27 police officer patrols outside the @entity19 embassy in @entity68 , @entity20 this weekend where mr @entity1 is under protection after suddenly arriving last tuesday protest : supporters of @entity1 demonstrate outside the @entity19 embassy last week , where the @entity5 founder has sought political asylum since suddenly arriving last tuesday accepting the documents , mr @entity79 said ' mr @entity1 is under the protection of the @entity19 state , as you know			1
' ( the letter ) will be sent to president @entity51 ... we will make sure he get ’s it			0
' over the weekend , the @entity19 ambassador left @entity20 to return to her home country for talks on the bid			0
@entity117 is to meet president @entity51 in the capital @entity119 , where she will personally brief him on the situation			0
speaking after visiting @entity1 today , mr @entity75 said mr @entity1 was in ' good spirits ' despite living in ' modest ' surroundings			0
' my sense is that @entity1 is used to simple living , ' said mr @entity75			0
' i 'd say he is living now as i did when i was an undergraduate in college - in what looked to me like a study that 's been converted into a makeshift bedroom that 's still functioning as a study and workspace			0
' asked whether @entity1 was sleeping on an inflatable mattress , mr @entity75 said : ' i wo n't deny that it 's an inflatable bed			0
' @entity5 spokesman @entity134 , who also visited mr @entity1 today , said ' little had changed ' regarding the asylum application			2
mr @entity134 said : ' the @entity19 government has requested material both from @entity1 and from authorities in @entity8 , the @entity27 and @entity3 before they make a formal decision			1
' mr @entity134 said reports that the @entity8 government had ruled out guaranteeing mr @entity1 wo n't be extradited to the @entity3 were of ' grave concern '			1
' i do n't have understanding whether this is the official position of the @entity8 government , but it 's of grave concern , ' he added			0
however , he said mr @entity1 was in ' good spirits ' and keeping busy , adding : ' he 's working , doing what we are supposed to be doing , @entity5			0
' discussion : the @entity19 ambassador @entity150 , left , has now gone back to @entity19 to discuss mr @entity1 's claim for political asylum			1
he has criticised @entity11 pm @entity153 , right , over the handling of his case meanwhile , mr @entity1 , who wants to start a new life in the @entity53 country , has again criticised @entity11 prime minister @entity153 over @entity159 's handling of his case			2
the former computer hacker said his situation was ' a serious political matter ... ( that ) the @entity11 government should treat with the seriousness it requires '			0
he said : ' i have been attacked by the @entity3 , from the vice president down , as a high - tech terrorist , and by the @entity8 prime minister and foreign minister -- surely that requires some direct response from the @entity153 government			1
' mr @entity1 has said he chose @entity19 's embassy instead of his home country 's because he felt @entity159 had done nothing to protect him , a charge the government has denied			1
@entity1 's bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers , including socialist @entity180 , facing an embarrassing £ 240,000 financial headache @entity159 has said it has limited capacity to help him because he is not in @entity11 and has not broken any @entity11 laws			2
@entity11 has also dismissed the idea that @entity28 is keen to get mr @entity1 , with foreign minister @entity185 saying sunday there was ' no hint ' of a plan to extradite him to the @entity3 last week , @entity19 's president said the @entity53 nation would have to consider ' whether @entity1 's life is at stake ' , as it makes it decision on asylum			1
president @entity51 told @entity195 the country ' defends the right to live '			0
president @entity51 also said : ' we are analysing @entity1 's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way			2
we ca n't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete			0
' mr @entity1 requested political asylum under the @entity205 , ironic given @entity19 's poor record on human rights and free speech			1
he is set to be extradited to @entity8 , where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in @entity13 in august 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture			2
mr @entity1 says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated			2
meanwhile , his bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers , including socialist @entity180 , facing an embarrassing £ 240,000 financial headache after they stumped up the cash to keep him out of jail			0
asked on @entity222 whether she was ' on the hook ' for his breach of bail , she replied : ' yes			0
i had expected him to face the allegations			0
i am as surprised as anyone by this			0
' @entity230 , film - makers @entity70 and @entity232 , and journalists @entity57 and @entity234 were among those who offered to support mr @entity1 's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to @entity8			1
those who did stand surety for mr @entity1 – freed on bail in december 2010 after spending nine days in @entity241 jail when held under a @entity243 arrest warrant issued by the @entity8 – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the embassy , just yards from @entity246 .			1

the @entity11 is prepared to go to @entity8 to face questioning over sex assault allegations
however , he fears @entity13 will turn him over to the @entity3 where he could face espionage and conspiracy charges
