@entity1 skipper @entity0 has recovered from his @entity3 hangover and aiming to continue his impressive run of clean sheets against @entity6 on sunday			1
@entity0 , 32 , has n't conceded in four matches for club and country following an impressive @entity11 draw in @entity12 on thursday night and another at @entity13 will make it five - in - a - row for the first time since the end of the 2012/13 season			1
it 's not a bad comeback for a player blamed for @entity21 's costly defeats against @entity22 and @entity23 in the summer			0
@entity24 of @entity12 is chased by @entity1 and @entity21 defender @entity0 during their @entity11 tie @entity0 has been making positive headlines in late september and says earlier criticism was over the top and he 's also added goals to his game , scoring against @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 this season			1
' keeping clean sheets is what my game is all about			0
if i can pop up with the occasinal goal , all the better , but as a defender my end of the bargain is to keep the ball out , ' he said			0
' there have been times this season at @entity1 where we did n't even look like keeping one clean sheet , never mind two in a row			2
now we 've got two decent results from difficult games , it gives the boys up front more to go on			0
' people were quick to point out how bad my loss of form was at the start of the season , but i knew it was n't as bad as had been made out			0
' then i score a couple of goals and i become a better player all of a sudden			2
that 's the way football is			0
' i feel for the majority of the season i can look myself in the mirror and the game against @entity12 was one of those			0
' since a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity72 on october 5 , @entity0 has played for @entity21 against @entity31 and @entity73 , and for his club side against @entity33 and @entity12 , and has n't seen @entity75 or @entity76 have to pick the ball out of the net			1
@entity0 : ' i score a couple of goals and i become a better player all of a sudden			1
that is the way football is ' @entity1 centre back @entity0 was mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring against @entity32 his club manager @entity85 has hailed his recent displays as ' immense ' particularly as he 's had to play with a number of different partners at the back ; @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 at @entity1 , and @entity93 for his country			1
talking about @entity1 , he said : ' it has been difficult when you 've not go much continuity because of the amount of games and injuries that we 've had			2
' but fair play to the boys , @entity102 ( @entity103 ) came in against @entity12			0
obviously i have played together a lot with @entity92 so it was nice to keep a clean sheet with our first appearance together in a while			0
' what made it even more satisfying to @entity1 fans was that their skipper snuffed out Â£ 10million @entity12 striker @entity117 , who is on loan there from @entity32			1
' he looked like a threat but i thought we dealt with him , ' he said			0
@entity1 climbed away from the lower regions of the table with a comprehensive 3 - 0 win against @entity33 last weekend			2
it was only their second @entity126 victory of the season and they will expect to use it as a springboard against opponents @entity6 who are still seeking their first win			1
@entity0 is looking towards @entity1 's clash with @entity6 on sunday and is keen to earn another clean sheet			1

@entity0 was being criticised earlier in the season as @entity1 conceded 13 goals in their opening five @entity126 games
@entity0 scored a *spectacular* goal against @entity32 to earn a 1 - 1 draw
he says scoring makes him appear ' a better player all of a sudden '
