by @entity0 the last words from the cockpit of the missing @entity4 plane before it disappeared were actually ' good night , @entity5 three seven zero , ' not ' all right , good night ' as @entity5 authorities had previously claimed			1
it is not clear whether the sign off was said by captain @entity9 or his co-pilot @entity9 , but it was transmitted as the plane left @entity5 airspace and was about to enter that of @entity13 at 1.19am on march 8			1
the cause of the discrepancy is unclear , but for three weeks it was reported that ' all right , good night ' had been said by co-pilot @entity9 two minutes before the planeâ € ™ s transponder was shut down			0
the last words from the cockpit of @entity9 before it disappeared from civilian radar were actually ' good night , @entity5 three seven zero ' not ' all right , good night ' as @entity5 authorities had previously claimed			1

the statement added that acting transport minister @entity46 ' has instructed the investigating team to release the full transcript ' which will be made available during the briefing to the next - of - kin of passengers on board the flight , which disappeared on march 8			1

experts warn debris must be found within days to nail down a crash site in order for any use of the @entity109 - supplied black box detector - known as a towed pinger locator ( @entity112 ) - to be feasible			2
the @entity113 , which has supplied the detection device , said in a statement monday : ' without confirmation of debris it will be virtually impossible to effectively employ the @entity112 since the range on the black - box pinger is only about a mile			1
' but @entity56 prime minister @entity121 said earlier in the day no time limit would be imposed on the search for clues as to what happened			0
' we owe it to the families , we owe it to everyone that travels by air , we owe it to the anxious governments of the countries who had people on that aircraft			2
we owe it to the wider world which has been transfixed by this mystery for three weeks now , ' @entity121 said in @entity98			0
the @entity142 carrying 239 people vanished without a trace on march 8 en route from @entity103 to @entity95 , leaving stunned relatives , the aviation industry , and ordinary travellers around the world hanging on the mystery			0

the image has been sent off for analysis drawing a blank : a @entity90 aircraft returns to @entity167 after searching for the missing jet families of @entity90 passengers have angrily attacked @entity5 , alleging incompetence and deceit in what even @entity5 officials call the ' unprecedented ' loss of a jumbo jet			1
more than a dozen @entity90 relatives - part of a group of nearly 30 who arrived on the weekend to press for answers - kept up the pressure after a prayer session monday at a @entity103 @entity185 temple			2
' we will never forgive those who hurt our families and do n't tell the truth and delay the rescue mission , ' a spokesman for the group , @entity188 , told reporters , reiterating suspicions toward @entity5 voiced by many relatives of the 153 @entity90 aboard			1
the @entity56 vessel @entity197 , fitted with the pinger locator and an underwater drone designed to home in on the black box 's signal , was to conduct sea trials off @entity98 on monday before heading to the search area			0
no time limit for the search : @entity56 's prime minister @entity121 addresses members of the international forces currently based in @entity98 searching for @entity9 @entity210 has been lost : @entity121 defended the @entity5 prime minister 's announcement that there was no hope for all on board the missing flight , saying all the evidence pointed to the plane going down in the southern @entity71 mr @entity121 said his main reason for visiting the @entity222 base was to thank the personnel who have come to help with the search			1
he is pictured here shaking hands with @entity90 's @entity75 senior colonel @entity226 , head of @entity90 's effort to locate the missing @entity4 flight @entity9 a black box signal usually lasts only about 30 days			0
fears are mounting that time will run out - @entity197 will not reach the search zone , now the size of @entity234 , until thursday , @entity46 said , roughly 26 days after the plane went missing			0
if floating @entity9 debris is found , authorities plan to analyse recent weather patterns and ocean currents to determine where the plane went down			0
@entity5 believes @entity9 was deliberately diverted by someone on board and that satellite data indicates it crashed in the remote @entity71			2
monday 's search saw ten planes take to the skies , with ten ships already at sea			0
@entity56 , @entity90 , @entity249 , @entity76 , @entity5 , @entity250 and the @entity109 are taking part			2
@entity5 remains officially in charge , but @entity56 has assumed increasing responsibility , appointing retired air chief marshal @entity254 to head a new coordination centre in @entity98			2
many @entity90 relatives , still holding out slim hopes , have taken issue with @entity55 's march 24 announcement that the plane was lost at sea , despite the lack of firm evidence			0
@entity46 said ' high - level ' @entity5 officials and experts involved in an investigation into @entity9 would brief families simultaneously in @entity103 and @entity95 ' soon ' in a bid to explain @entity5 's stance			1

the items were said to be red , orange and white - similar to the colours of a @entity4 jet			0
this picture shows a suspected item of debris highlighted several objects have been spotted from search planes			0
this map shows the planned search area for monday in testy exchanges with foreign journalists monday , @entity46 said : ' we are not hiding anything , we are just following the procedure that has been set			0
' @entity5 also has come under fire from @entity90 's state media , while @entity95 has pressed for more transparency in the investigation			1
authorities there allowed angry relatives to stage a rare protest last week at @entity5 's embassy			1
but a commentary in the government - controlled @entity309 struck a more measured tone monday , urging relatives to accept their losses			0
' although the @entity5 government 's handling of the crisis has been quite clumsy , we need to understand this is perhaps the most bizarre incident in @entity321 civil aviation history , ' it said .			1
