by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 it felt like the end of an era as @entity6 waited for fans behind his goal to return the ball , and they started to sing his name : ‘ @entity11 , @entity11			1
’ the king is dead , long live the king			2
@entity14 , @entity16 ’s undisputed no 1 for a decade , sat among the substitutes , naked without his protective headgear			1
@entity19 has tried to dance around this subject for most of the summer , but his final decision is looming large and the selection of @entity6 against @entity23 suggests he will go with the younger man at @entity25 on monday			1
@entity6 came out for the second half , too			1
@entity6 did not have lots to do but did what was required with polish			2
he made no fuss over routine saves , was a quick from his penalty box when necessary and his handling was clean			0
if there is one doubt about the @entity51 , it is how he will cope with the extra physical attention and aerial attack in @entity54			0
if there are no problems , @entity55 could soon be on his way			0
if so , he deserves a farewell fit for a hero .			0

@entity6 started @entity16 **'s** final *pre-season* game against @entity23
whilst @entity14 could be in for a place on the substitute **'s** bench
the @entity69 *international* has been no 1 at @entity16 for 10 *years*
