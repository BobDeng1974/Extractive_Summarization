forget the provocative likes of @entity1 and @entity2 ; in @entity4 , the look that both men and women aspire to is cute , wholesome and resolutely virginal			1
@entity4 culture , in particular popular cartoons such as @entity8 and @entity9 , has an innocent mien while the cult of the computer game loving geek , the otaru , is burgeoning			1
but @entity4 's obsession with all things cute has come at a price			2
not only are people having less sex , the country 's birthrate has declined so much the @entity4 population is expected to drop by a third within the next 50 years			1
no sex please , we 're @entity4 : many young people from @entity4 are choosing not to have sex in @entity31 , a city of 35 million people , just 250,000 babies are born each year - a shockingly low figure when compared to @entity34 's rate of 135,000 children born to a population of just eight million			1
so what 's going on ? it 's a question that film maker @entity39 attempts to answer in new @entity42 documentary , no sex please , we 're @entity4			1
' there are lots of reasons for the population decline but one of the biggest trends is that young @entity4 people are moving away from wanting to have sex , ' @entity39 revealed in an interview with @entity53			1
' many young people have just decided they do n't want any part of it			0
i 'm as baffled as anyone else by it ! ' most baffling of all are the otaku [ geeks ] , many of whom have chosen to withdraw from the dating game altogether in favour of ' relationships ' with virtual girlfriends			1
an increasing number of ' otaku ' ( geeks ) are choosing to have a relationship with a virtual girlfriend over a real woman among them are @entity77 , 38 , and @entity78 , 39 , whose ' girlfriends ' ne - ne and @entity80 both come in a box and are part of a virtual game created by @entity85 called @entity86 +			1
and the pair really do believe they 're in real relationships with the animated characters			2
' i like the girls in this game too much , ' explains @entity78 , who adds that he tries not to have sexual feelings about his virtual girlfriend because the relationship is supposed to be platonic			0
asked whether he 'd like a real girlfriend , he answers : ' yes of course i do but since i began a relationship with @entity79 , i 'm really emotionally involved with her			0
' ' @entity79 ' , should you have forgotten , is a cartoon schoolgirl , who says things like : ' do you really want to talk this late at night ? ' , ' because i like you , i will always want to be with you ' and ' @entity104 to the beach , let 's dream and have lots of fun			0
' @entity78 , who says he is 17 in the @entity86 + game , explains that for him , being involved with a cartoon is easier because he will never have to contemplate marriage			0
' at high school you can have relationships without having to think about marriage , ' he explains			0
' with real life girlfriends , you have to consider marriage so i think twice about going out with a 3d woman			0
' is it the @entity4 obsession with cute that is leading to the population crisis ? ' there 's so many great distractions , ' explains @entity126 , a non-otaku man who appears in the documentary			1
' why would you get into something as messy , as troubling , as disorienting as a relationship when you could have a virtual girlfriend , a virtual experience , that maybe is even superior to the reality ? ' i do know a number of men in @entity4 , and elsewhere , who find the role play games , the dating @entity139 , even advances in pornography , and would rather experience the opposite sex that way than go through the challenges of relationships			1
' unsurprisingly , @entity4 women are not impressed			2
' relatively speaking , i think most @entity4 women find @entity4 men wanting , ' explains @entity126			1
' men have n't developed autonomy or a sense of individualism and you now have a generation of women who want something more			0
they want to be independent themselves and they want men to be independent too			0
' ' they were nice guys and totally normal , ' says @entity39 of @entity158 and @entity77			0
' they were cool blokes but when it comes to women , they do n't want to engage			0
' her view is borne out by the experience of a group of @entity4 women interviewed for the documentary , among them career girls @entity162 and @entity169			1
' @entity4 men are straight but they are not interested in women that much , ' explains @entity162			1
' they do n't aggressively try to get girlfriends			0
documentary : film maker @entity39 went in search of reasons for the @entity4 preference for celibacy her friend @entity169 adds : ' they are afraid to get real contact with humans			1
' a recent survey by @entity4 insurance company @entity183 found that a third of @entity4 men under 40 have never dated women at all , although women themselves are n't much better			1
' they are afraid to get real contact with humans			0
' - @entity169 a survey by the @entity190 done earlier this year found that 45 per cent of women between 18 and 24 ' were not interested in or despised sexual contact			0
' ' a few people ca n't relate to the opposite sex physically or in any other way , ' adds @entity196 , a @entity4 sex and relationship counsellor in an interview with the @entity200			2
' they flinch if i touch them			0
most are men , but i 'm starting to see more women			0
' so what is to be done about @entity4 's ageing population and sex - shy younger generation ? for @entity39 , the answer is more immigration , which she says would give women freedom to work after becoming mothers - a practice currently frowned upon in @entity4 - as well increasing the number of taxpayers			2
' everyone in @entity4 is aware of the problem so conversations happening at highest level , ' she explains			2
' they know they need to adapt workplaces to make them child and family friendly			0
but immigration is big issue over there because @entity4 is nation that 's always been closed			2
' but with an ageing population and a growing number of twenty and thirty - somethings who simply are n't interested in real life relationships , @entity4 is running out of time			2
no sex please , we 're @entity4 airs tomorrow night at 9pm on @entity237 in @entity31 , a city of 35 million people , just 250,000 babies are born each year compared to @entity34 's rate of 135,000 children born to a population of just eight million			1

only *27* per cent of @entity4 couples have sex at least once a week
some ' otaku ' ( geek ) men choose to have virtual girlfriends instead
