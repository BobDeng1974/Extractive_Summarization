hiring a hitman has never been easier			2
nor has purchasing cocaine or heroin , nor even viewing horrific child pornography			2
such purchases are now so easy , in fact , that they can all be done from the comfort of one 's home at the click of a button ... and there 's almost nothing the police can do about it			2
this worrying development of the criminal black market is down entirely to the @entity16 - a seething matrix of encrypted websites - also known as @entity18 - that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity			1
chilling : so for those looking to bump off a difficult acquaintance , all they have to do is enter the @entity26 and search ' hitman for hire ' , such as this one guns for hire : this site appears to offer the services of a team of former mercenaries from the french foreign legion the @entity16 has existed for more than a decade but came under the spotlight last month after police shutdown the @entity39 website - the online marketplace dubbed the ' @entity41 of drugs ' - and arrested its creator			1
but experts warn this has done next to nothing to stem the rising tide of such illicit online exchanges , which are already jostling to fill the gap now left in this unregulated virtual world			2
so for those looking to bump off a difficult acquaintance , all they have to do is enter the @entity16 - known also as the ' dark web ' or the ' @entity56 ' - and search ' hitman for hire '			1
place your bets : some ' hitmen ' seem to offer others the chance to profit from their killing by allowing users to bet on when a victim will die by putting money in a pool			1
the closest guess takes home the pot kill that ex you hate ? this rather more rudimentary website offers to ' neutralist the ex you hate , your bully , a policeman that you have been in trouble with , a lawyer a small politician ' there they are presented with lists of willing assassins touting their wares to anyone who will pay			2
and like @entity86 , transactions are all made using the mysterious online currency @entity88			1
one site , whose name @entity90 has chosen not to publish , offers an assassination in the @entity94 or @entity95 for $ 10,000 and one in @entity97 for $ 12,000			2
' i do not know anything about you , you do not know anything about me , ' crows one self - styled assassin , according to @entity103			2
' the desired victim will pass away			2
no one will ever know why or who did this			2
on top of that i always give my best to make it look like an accident or suicide			1
' @entity18 - short for @entity18 - is a seething matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity			1
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online			0
normally , file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user 's unique ip address that can be traced back to an individual computer			0
the @entity18 on the @entity16 hides the ip address and the activity of the user			1
most of the @entity134 's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages do n't exist until created as the result of a specific search			0
an internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught , but a majority is deep and therefore missed			0
' i have gained endless experience ( s ) in this [ sic ] 7 years , ' he goes on			0
' it has changed me a lot			0
i do n't have any empathy for humans anymore			0
' this makes me the perfect professional for taking care of your problems and makes me better than other hitmen			1
if you pay enough i 'll do anything to the desired victim			0
if i say anything i mean anything			0
' many of the sites even use slogans and marketing techniques that , if it were n't for their macabre subject matter , could be as at home on the website of a legitimate retail website			0
' the best place to put your problems is in a grave , ' boasts one			1
some even seem to offer others the chance to profit from their killing by allowing users to bet on when a victim will die by putting money in a pool			1
the closest guess takes home the pot. and while many appear every inch the cold - blooded killer one would expect from a gun - for - hire , there is also apparently the odd humanitarian hitman			1
' @entity193 is in most cases wrong , yes , ' writes one			0
' however , as this is an inevitable direction in the technological evolution , i would rather see it in the hands of me than somebody else			0
' ' by providing it cheaply and accurately i hope that more immoral alternatives wo n't be profitable or trusted enough			0
this should primarily be a tool for retribution			0
' adding that murder should always be committed for ' good reason ' , he writes : ' bad reasons include doctors for performing abortions and @entity211 for making annoying music			0
' the @entity39 : the @entity16 has existed for more than a decade but came under the spotlight last month after police shutdown the @entity39 website - the online marketplace dubbed the ' @entity41 of drugs - and arrested its creator arrest : the @entity39 's creator , @entity219 , was arrested earlier this month after allegedly hiring an undercover @entity221 agent to kill two people the @entity39 's creator , @entity219 , was arrested last month after allegedly hiring an undercover @entity221 agent to murder a member of the site who was apparently blackmailing him			1
he allegedly also tried to have an employee killed who he thought might blow his identity to police			0
meanwhile , even as the @entity39 was trundling to a halt , already hundreds of other websites were springing up in its place , peddling anything from drugs to stolen identities , illegal weapons to sickening child pornography and even explosives			1
in june it emerged one such site , called @entity242 , was even offering its wares in an advert posted on @entity245			0
looking like an advert for a well - funded @entity248 start - up , the slick promo video for @entity242 boasts that it is ' the world 's best anonymous online drug marketplace '			2
dangerous drugs : a screengrab of of the @entity242 online marketplace shows some of the illegal drugs on offer , including heroin , cannabis , @entity260 and @entity261 it comes as the site 's backers announced the launch of a ' big social media campaign ' that seems intended to make a play for the market share of the better - known @entity39			1
but while experts say police are all but powerless to shut down websites selling illicit products , authorities claim they are making inroads in their bid to stifle the @entity16 's growth			1
the @entity94 federal government appears to have been forcing the shut down of pedophiles communities on the shady underbelly of the internet by targeting sites hiding within the @entity16			1
august saw the arrest of @entity284 @entity283 , who the @entity221 has called ' the biggest facilitator of child pornography on the planet '			0
@entity283 is accused of running @entity288 , a web hosting service that operates on the anonymous @entity18			1
forums on @entity288 allegedly allowed pedophiles to anonymously share horrific child pornography and trade tips on how to sexually abuse children without getting caught .			0

dozens of ' hitmen ' are available for hire through the ' @entity16 ' , or @entity18
they all offer their services for a price paid in mysterious currency @entity88
one boasts : ' i always do my best to make it look like an accident or suicide '
others market services : ' the best place to put your problems is in a grave '
