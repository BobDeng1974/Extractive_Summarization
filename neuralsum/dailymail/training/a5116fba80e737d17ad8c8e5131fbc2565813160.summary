by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 19 august 2013 a thrifty gardener is still using the same tools his grandfather first used 130 years ago			1
@entity4 inherited the utensils in 1979 from his late father @entity6 who had been given them by his own father , and has been using them ever since			1
the former hairdresser from @entity10 , @entity11 , claims they are more reliable than tools in shops today			1
mr @entity4 has been using his grandfather 's tools since 1979 and claims they are more reliable than those in shops today despite being over 130 years old , the @entity21 weeding hoe and digging fork are in surprisingly good condition			1
the handles of both tools are made from elm wood , with their steel ends remaining in almost pristine condition			2
the four prongs on the fork have been worn down slightly and are now only four inches long , about half their original length			0
but mr @entity4 insists he would n't be caught in his garden without them			1
he said : ' my grandfather was a professional gardener for a wealthy landowner and his boss bought the tools for him			2
' i guess they built things to last in those days			0
' my father was given them and he worked as a chauffeur and gardener and so used them professionally as well			0
' when he retired he even took them to his retirement home and used them right up until he died in 1979 ' i have had them since then and use them all the time in my garden and allotment			0
they are perfect for tidying up a flower border			0
' i always keep them clean and wipe them off after i use them			0
' i 've had lots of other forks over the years but the tines of those end up bending out of shape and they do n't last			0
' mr @entity4 who lives with his wife , @entity62 , does not have any sons of his own to pass the tools on to			1
' if and when it gets to the point where i ca n't manage the garden anymore i will probably donate them to a museum , ' he said .			2

claims the 130 year old utensils are more reliable than ones found in shops today
