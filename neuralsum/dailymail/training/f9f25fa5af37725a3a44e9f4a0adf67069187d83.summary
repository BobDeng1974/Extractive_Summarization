by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 20:09 est , 18 october 2012 blood trickled down my face like raindrops down a window pane — so much blood that i can honestly say i ’ve experienced few things as frightening in my life			1
admittedly i had volunteered to subject myself to a radical new treatment known as the @entity10 and i had feared there might be some blood — but i had n’t anticipated looking as though i ’d been attacked by bloodsuckers and left with a face that bore a close resemblance to a novelty @entity17 mask			1
so why would anyone even think of putting themselves through such a procedure , you might ask ? treatment : why would anyone even think of putting themselves through such a procedure , you might ask ? i could blame it all on actress @entity27 , 36 , a beautiful woman whose youthful face belies her years			1
she is one of the many celebrities who swear by the @entity10 and has been extolling the virtues of regular treatments , enthusing about what a difference they have made to her complexion			1
but the truth is , i ’d been swotting up on the @entity10 some time before ms @entity27 went public			1
despite an eye - watering £ 600 price tag , the biggest relief is that it ’s not a facelift at all and involves no knives , nips or tucks , but does have the rejuvenating effect of surgery			1
closer research reveals that it is a 90 - minute procedure which boosts the creation of new blood cells and collagen , and promises the best and safest skin rejuvenation known to woman			1
the even better news ? no incisor bites to the neck , no nocturnal rampaging , no garlic required			0
and so i surrendered myself to @entity55 , an aesthetic nurse practitioner at @entity56 , the cosmetic clinic in @entity57 i ’ve been using for years			1
over to you : i surrendered myself to @entity55 , an aesthetic nurse practitioner at @entity56 in @entity57 while i lay back listening to an anaesthetising @entity60 track on my @entity61 , dressed in a blue surgical gown , @entity55 applied a thick white cream to my face , neck and décolletage to numb the pain he was about to inflict upon me			1
waiting for the topical anaesthetic to kick in , i looked away as @entity55 took two vials of blood from my arm using a needle and syringe			2
happy : i 've had it done twice now and i 'll definitely be going back for more it did n’t hurt but i am squeamish , so it was n’t an especially comfortable experience			0
@entity55 then put the blood into a machine which spins it around at high speed for six minutes until the red and white blood cells have separated — a process that produces a plasma rich with platelets , or very small cells , which stimulate the growth of more cells			1
the blood collection tube has three distinct parts and looks a bit like one of those old ice lollies — at the bottom are the dark red blood cells , in the middle are the white cells and at the top is the ‘ liquid gold ’ , which are the platelets			1
only the platelets are reinjected back into the face , neck and decolletage and the rest is thrown away			0
this whole process has to happen quickly because the platelets need to be back inside the body within ten minutes , otherwise they coagulate and turn to jelly — which is exactly how my stomach felt at this point			0
@entity55 extracted the plasma from the top of the two vials using a syringe , then injected it into the ‘ trouble spots ’ in my face — the wrinkles under my eyes , the ‘ tram lines ’ that run from my nose down to my mouth — and into my neck			0
it was at that point that @entity55 held up the mirror to my face and all i could see were rivulets of blood running down it			2
what on earth had i done to myself ? and would my face ever recover from the gory mess it had so suddenly become ? i ’d wanted to look like a dewy - faced a-list actress in the prime of her life , not like someone who was auditioning for a @entity135 horror film			2
but for all the shock of that moment , i did feel the @entity10 made good sense			1
pricey : you need three @entity139 - £ 1,800 in all - for the best results , at four to six - week intervals we ’ve all read about the challenges and dangers of cosmetic surgery , and heard negative stories about @entity147 and facial fillers			2
by contrast , the @entity10 is non-invasive and involves no foreign bodies			1
the restorative powers of a person ’s blood being injected back into them were first discovered by the medical world and , in the case of the @entity10 , by sports doctors			1
beautiful actress : @entity27 , 36 , is one of the many celebrities who swear by the @entity10 they regularly inject an injured athlete ’s blood back into a muscle to accelerate recovery			1
this helps to rebuild cells quickly and stimulates collagen , a protein which gives skin firmness and strength			1
we lose about one per cent of our collagen every year from the moment we are born , so at 54 more than half of mine has gone			2
i first heard about the @entity10 when @entity177 confessed to being a devotee			1
her enthusiasm was echoed by @entity55 , who described it as the state - of - the art procedure when it comes to non-surgical facelifts			2
with all those pin pricks and all that blood , it ’s not a treatment for the squeamish			2
however , it ’s no more painful than several other procedures i ’ve had , including @entity190 ( a wrinkle reduction system where the face is ironed ) and the @entity193 ( an acid peel that leaves you looking like a @entity196 )			0
you need three @entity139 — £ 1,800 in all — for the best results , at four to six - week intervals			2
after that , a session is recommended every six months for general maintenance			0
i ’ve had it done twice now and i ’ll definitely be going back for more			0
it ’s about two months since my second session , and i can see a big difference in my face , especially around my eyes			0
my skin is fresher and plumper , and there are fewer lines , especially on my neck and around my eyes			0
the test of a good procedure is not that people can tell you ’ve had something done — @entity221 ’s facelift would be an example of that — but that they simply think you look well , happy and youthful			2
my face also passed ‘ the @entity225 ’			0
@entity226 ’s the make - up artist on the sunday morning television show on which i sometimes appear			0
separated : the blood collection tube has three distinct parts and looks a bit like one of those old ice lollies apart from @entity55 , @entity226 ’s the only person who ever sees my skin close - up			2
when i did the programme a couple of weeks ago , she said my skin looked amazing			0
i noticed it has also worked wonders on my neck , an area so vulnerable to the signs of ageing			0
i 've had it done twice now and i ’ll definitely be going back for more			0
it 's about two months since my second session , and i can see a big difference in my face , especially around my eyes the @entity10 does n’t give you a frozen @entity147 face , nor the unnaturally puffed - up cheeks which can result from badly done fillers			1
i ’ve never much liked having my blood taken , and having it reinjected back into me was an entirely novel experience , which did leave me feeling rather queasy			0
but , nausea aside , it does soften and remove lines , especially around the eyes where wrinkles are the hardest to get rid of without surgery , and it definitely plumps up the skin			0
happily , there is very little downtime after the procedure , which was a relief			0
there was no bruising , and just a little puffiness which had gone within a couple of days			0
i ’m a convert to the @entity10 and have already booked my next one in a month ’s time			1
the fact that it does n’t involve lead - lined coffins and low - flying bats is just another point in its favour .			0
