it does not take @entity1 long to get the heavy roller out in his latest book , which is not so much an autobiography but his version of the often troubled episodes that marked his final years in international cricket			1
you get the idea very early on , in the first few pages , as he recounts the meeting with @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 when he is informed that his @entity16 career is effectively over			1
" the three wise men have decided that the disastrous @entity19 tour was all my fault , " he declares			2
it can not , of course , be true that they believed it was all down to one man , and over the next three hundred pages we are invited to make our own minds up about whether he was treated fairly or not			2
@entity1 poses for pictures outside the @entity32 studios in @entity33 before appearing on breakfast tv by the very end of @entity1 : my autobiography , he admits ‘ there should have been more cricket in these pages ’ , and he would probably have helped his own cause if that were to be the case			1
the theme of persecution runs through it like letters through a stick of @entity49 rock , as does the often very personal criticism of coach @entity51			2
there is too much of both , but it also leaves you to conclude that @entity1 has been sinned against as well as sinning			1
the overall effect is to bestow a sense of melancholy as much as anything , for with a little more understanding of the human condition on both sides the most exciting @entity16 batsman of his generation might not be lost to the team , as he surely is now			1
there is something faintly tragic when he almost pleads in the final chapter " i hope it might not truly be over " with reference to @entity16			1
there is admirable self - awareness , and the tacit admission that being a @entity75 freelance can never replace being a fully - fledged international , when he says in the preceding paragraph : " any player who has been to the top mourns the excitement when it ends			2
" @entity1 is heavily critical of former @entity16 head coach @entity51 ( right ) throughout the book that helps make this book is a fascinating read , expertly and colourfully ghosted by journalist @entity85 , and it will have an appeal well beyond the boundaries of the cricket constituency			1
when the smoke clears from all the vitriol and insults , there is much to glean for any follower of any sport			0
for instance the truism that success often only hides divisions in a dressing room , and that it is not necessarily the product of harmony behind the scenes			0
this effect is always exaggerated in cricket , which shoehorns players together for longer periods than any other pursuit			0
you are also reminded that even glamorous and gifted superstars of sport are as needy and insecure as anyone else , often more so			0
they are traits which abound in @entity1 , although he is a complex man of many parts			1
i got to know him relatively well in the early part of his @entity16 career as we used to collaborate on a column for @entity121 together			1
many of the things i recognised at the start of his journey are still recognisable throughout this book : he is someone of immense drive and ambition , likeable in many ways , intelligent and good company , polite and with some strong values			2
he could also , sometimes unwittingly , be quite rude and selfish			0
@entity1 takes in the applause after his famous century in the @entity133 at the @entity134 you can understand him being upset by the attitude of what he terms the bowling clique of @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , who it is quite possible to imagine being a fairly malevolent force as a collective , if not as individuals			1
the business of the spoof @entity150 account directed at him clearly wounds him more deeply than anyone would imagine , and exposes his more vulnerable side			0
he also had to cope with what seems the general mistrust in our country , not just in cricket , of maverick exceptional talents			0
he could , unquestionably , have been handled better by the @entity160 and @entity51 in particular			0
yet his brutal analysis of @entity51 – you may have read by now his description that 95 per cent of the time the coach was ‘ f * * * ing horrendous ’ – simply does not stand up to scrutiny			0
@entity51 ’s methods could not have been so crude as clearly they worked for most of the time with outstanding results , and any fair - minded observer could hardly quarrel with what he and @entity172 achieved			2
@entity1 ’s treatment of the coach , with whom the whole @entity176 question was evidently a constant bone of contention , is unnecessarily vicious			1
some of the ridicule heaped on @entity179 is plain amusing , some of it surely unwarranted			0
his condescension towards @entity12 as a captain , who he almost describes as some sort of @entity187 figure from @entity188 , is a case of damning with the faintest praise , but may ring more true			0
@entity51 and @entity1 regularly clashed over the batsman 's desire to play in the @entity176 it is hard to disagree with @entity142 ’s assessment on monday that he has soft - pedalled on some figures in order not to jeopardise the possibility of a return one day			1
one example of how @entity1 has managed to alienate people through his career is a particularly gratuitous swipe at the undeserving @entity204 batsman @entity203 , who he does not especially rate on account of his height			1
he refers to @entity203 ’s father being a jockey , and suggests the son might be more suited for that profession			0
but ultimately you can not argue that @entity1 deserves his say , he has clearly been misunderstood to a degree and , to his credit , he does acknowledge that he has made plenty of mistakes			1
he is not as bad as some would portray him , but not as pure as he would portray himself			0
that is like so many autobiographies , but it would be wrong to paint this as any off - the - peg account of a sporting career			2
it is much better than that , and an essential read .			0

@entity1 's book , ' @entity1 : my autobiography ' was released on monday
