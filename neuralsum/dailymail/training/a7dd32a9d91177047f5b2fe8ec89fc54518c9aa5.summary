a new £ 90 million emergency - only hospital hailed as ‘ a glimpse of the future ’ by the most senior doctor in the @entity5 will lead to three other @entity7 units being effectively downgraded , @entity0 can reveal			1
after @entity10 medical director professor sir @entity9 visited the site of the @entity12 last february , he praised it as an example for others to follow			1
local @entity5 bosses say it ‘ aligns ’ with sir @entity9 ’s controversial plan to develop a two - tier emergency network across @entity10 – a move critics claim will jeopardise @entity17 , meaning longer journeys for patients			1
local @entity5 bosses have accused sir @entity9 of trying to create a ' two tier ' emergency response system which critics say will mean longer journeys for patients when unveiling his national plan in november 2013 , sir @entity9 said it was ‘ complete nonsense ’ to suggest some @entity17 would be downgraded as a result of the drive to develop larger specialist units			1
but the opening in june of a new 210 - bed facility in @entity35 , ten miles north of @entity36 , will trigger the loss of ‘ blue - light ’ emergency services at three district general hospitals elsewhere in @entity41			2
officials insist @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 hospitals will maintain ‘ walk - in @entity7 services ’			1
yet the three units will only be staffed and equipped to cope with incidents typically dealt with by lower - ranking urgent care centres , according to a leading doctor			1
dr @entity52 , who fought to keep a casualty department at @entity55 ’s @entity54 said : ‘ i think it ’s misleading to say they will still be a&es			2
it ’s stretching the common interpretation of @entity7 to breaking point			1
’ the consultant physician claimed @entity41 was a harbinger of what would happen under the @entity9 plan			1
' there ’s a danger the centralisation argument is being used as a juggernaut to halve the number of district general hospital a&es in @entity10 , ’ he claimed			0
for more than two years , @entity0 has been campaigning against @entity7 closures , which can leave patients having to travel further			2
local campaigners say @entity5 bosses should come clean and admit the @entity17 are being downgraded			1
@entity75 , 57 , an angina sufferer from @entity77 , @entity41 , who has been treated more than a dozen times for serious problems at @entity80 , said last night : ‘ once these changes go through , it wo n’t have a proper @entity7			2
’ while hospitals such as @entity83 , which are close to @entity35 , will still technically have @entity7 departments , they will be staffed and equipped like lesser ranking urgent treatment centres dr @entity52 said calling the units at hospitals such as @entity88 was ' stretching the common interpretation of @entity7 to breaking point ' the three ‘ walk - in @entity17 ’ will treat ‘ minor head , ear or eye problems , broken noses and nose bleeds , sprains and strains , cuts and bites , minor children ’s injuries and ailments , minor breaks and abscesses and wounds ’ , said a spokeswoman for @entity95			1
they will no longer take ‘ blue - light ’ ambulances – meaning patients with heart and lung problems , strokes , other serious afflictions suffered mainly by the elderly , or those with life - threatening injuries will be taken straight to @entity35			0
neither will the district generals carry out emergency surgery			0
as a result , @entity45 and @entity122 – which each see more than 60,000 patients a year – will lose half their patients			0
@entity44 , which lost trauma and emergency surgery in 2005 , will see around 4,000 of its 17,000 @entity7 patients go			2
@entity130 medical director @entity129 said senior @entity7 doctors and specialist nurses from the three hospitals would be ‘ pooled ’ to work at the new site			1
but speaking to @entity0 , mr @entity129 sidestepped questions about whether the changes amounted to downgrading of the three existing a&es			0
@entity45 hospital will see up to half of its patients go under plans to downsize the @entity7 department he said : ‘ we are relocating medical cover into one central location			1
we are still providing emergency care centres at our existing hospitals , which will be staffed by nurses and doctors 24 hours a day			2
’ he said he was awaiting guidance from @entity10 about what units offering ‘ walk - in @entity7 services ’ should be called			1
the @entity95 has committed to having an @entity7 consultant at the units between 9am and 5pm on weekdays			1
there will always be a doctor plus nurses on site at nights and weekends , said the spokeswoman			2
but miss @entity75 , who has helped lead an online petition signed by 1,700 people to safeguard @entity44 ’s emergency services , said : ‘ we are concerned about patient safety			0
’ some elderly people who are without a car would be 50 miles from @entity35 , she said			0
an @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ while @entity10 sets out the ambitions for the future of @entity173 and emergency care , it is for local gp - led commissioning groups to decide what is best for their own areas			2
’ sir @entity9 said trusts needed to be clear about what each emergency unit could do , adding : ‘ not all @entity7 units are currently equal – they do n’t all offer the same level or quality of service			1
‘ unless we are transparent it is impossible to have the constructive local debates we need			0
’ @entity190 's brother - in - law : @entity7 is in crisis by @entity192 cardiologist @entity193 , who is married to the prime minister ’s sister @entity194 , warned of an ' unprecedented ' demand on the @entity5 @entity197 faced embarrassment over the @entity5 crisis last night after his doctor brother - in - law warned of ‘ unprecedented ’ pressure on the health service			1
cardiologist @entity193 , who is married to the prime minister ’s sister @entity194 , spoke of the ‘ extraordinary ’ challenges faced by his own hospital trust in @entity206 over the past few weeks			0
it also emerged that the trust , which is made up of three hospitals , is so stretched that it has asked it workers and other non-medical staff to help out on the wards			0
dr @entity193 , medical director at @entity213 , raised the alarm over the pressure his @entity7 department in @entity217 was coming under			1
he said : ‘ it is important people understand this is unprecedented			0
there is no doubt that we , and other hospitals around the country , are facing extraordinary challenges			0
’ dr @entity193 revealed that the @entity7 department was dealing with 11 per cent more patients than at the same period last year and was struggling to move patients on and make space for new arrivals			1
he said : ‘ there are problems with access to adult services – we are seeing a lot of frail , elderly people who need special care			0
if the back door is blocked , it makes it difficult to get in the front door			0
’ the trust has tried to relieve the pressure on doctors and nurses by asking administrative and it staff to help on wards by serving meals or sorting laundry			0
in a leaked email , management told staff : ‘ there is a desperate need to support clinical staff on wards			0
’ it is not the first time mr @entity197 ’s brother - in - law has embarrassed the prime minister over the @entity5			0
four years ago , he warned hospitals could lose out under the @entity264 ’s controversial @entity5 reforms by giving too much power to @entity266 , though he later backtracked on the remark			0
dr @entity193 and the trust were not available for comment last night , but @entity271 ’s shadow health secretary @entity270 said : ‘ if mr @entity197 wo n’t listen to patients and the public , maybe his own family will have better luck			0
‘ he has been warned for months about the @entity7 crisis he ’s caused			2

@entity7 department opened at @entity279 , @entity280
