by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 17:05 est , 1 march 2013 ten years on , @entity1 has finally admitted that the disastrous war in @entity3 was ‘ unjustified ’			2
the @entity5 politician , who was deputy prime minister at the time , said he had supported the intervention because he was assured that @entity7 had a plan to bring peace to the @entity10			1
but the @entity12 president apparently lost interest in solving the @entity16 - @entity15 conflict , and now @entity1 says he thought the war was wrong			2
talks : lord @entity1 greets @entity18 at @entity19 in 2002 during an interview on the @entity23 ’s @entity22 programme @entity1 said that despite changing his view of the conflict , he could not ‘ just disown ’ his previous support for the invasion			1
lord @entity1 added : ‘ i go through my thoughts trying to justify it , but it can not be justified as an intervention			1
’ @entity32 lost 179 servicemen and women in the @entity12 - led @entity3 conflict , which began on march 20 , 2003			0
at least 100,000 @entity3 died			0
earlier this week @entity36 , the prime minister at the time , admitted @entity3 was not as safe as he would like it to be , but insisted the situation would be far worse now had @entity40 been left in power			0
former prime minister @entity36 admitted that @entity3 was not as safe as he would like it to be declining once again to offer an apology for the invasion , he said : ‘ if we had n’t removed @entity40 from power just think , for example , what would be happening if these @entity54 revolutions were continuing now and @entity40 , who ’s probably 20 times as bad as @entity50 in @entity51 , was trying to suppress an uprising in @entity3 ? think of the consequences of leaving that regime in power			1
so when you say “ do you think of the loss of life since 2003 ? ” of course i do			0
you would have to be inhumane not to , but think of what would have happened if he had been left there			0
’ lord @entity1 told the @entity23 on thursday that , ahead of the invasion , mr @entity36 had been keen ‘ to get the @entity12 in ’ on the @entity70 ’s approach to dealing with @entity3			1
he said that after mr @entity36 had sent him to speak to vice-president @entity18 , he told the pm it was clear ‘ they ’re going to go in without you ; whether you come with them or not , it does n’t matter to the @entity12 – they ’re getting ready ’			0
lord @entity1 added : ‘ but i tell you something that persuaded me			1
' you know @entity7 was quite prepared to have a plan for @entity16 and the whole problem in regard to @entity82 and he promised			1
and , therefore , that plan was something			1
’ but lord @entity1 said the plan ‘ fell apart as it often does in @entity12 politics because the influence domestically is too great ’			2
the former deputy labour leader said that , despite these factors , ‘ at the end of the day , @entity36 obviously said to himself , “ i ’ve promised to do this and i ’m going to do it ” , and that ’s today ’s consequences			0

@entity36 said @entity3 was better off without @entity40 in power lord @entity1 ’s comments go further than the previous doubts he has expressed over the @entity100			2
in 2009 he admitted in the @entity102 magazine that he wondered how he had agreed to go along with @entity32 ’s participation in the war			0
a year later he gave evidence to the @entity106 , when he revealed he had doubts about the intelligence on @entity40 ’s weapons programmes before the invasion .			2

said he was assured that @entity7 had plan for peace in @entity10
added he could not ' just disown ' his previous support for the invasion
