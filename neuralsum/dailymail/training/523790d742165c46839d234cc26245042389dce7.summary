by @entity1 reporter life threatening : @entity3 , above , was left with deep lacerations after colliding with the door while wearing just a bikini			1
the glass in the @entity9 window was not toughened or reinforced a compensation payout to a holidaymaker who suffered life - threatening injuries after walking into a glass door in her bikini is threatening to leave the @entity18 travel industry in chaos , top judges have heard			1
lawyers have warned that an award to @entity3 , who was hurt during her stay at an exclusive @entity26 hotel , will ‘ create great difficulties for the tourist industry ’ by expecting ‘ far - flung exotic places ’ to comply with @entity18 health and safety standards			1
mrs @entity3 had been relaxing on her balcony at the @entity30 in @entity31 when she heard a phone ring inside , and accidentally walked into the closed @entity9 windows which led into her room			1
the glass shattered and she suffered deep lacerations all over her body which , according to her lawyers , could have been life - threatening			0
in october last year mrs @entity3 , 53 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , sued trip organisers @entity40 and was awarded £ 24,000 damages			1
however the company are now asking the @entity43 to overturn that decision			0
they have pointed out that if the courts hold @entity18 travel companies responsible for ensuring tough @entity18 safety rules are upheld around the world , then it will make life more difficult for the industry – a problem which could end up raising prices for other holidaymakers			2
@entity56 , representing @entity40 , confirmed in court that the accident had left mrs @entity3 with ‘ multiple lacerations ’			1
she told judges : ‘ on june 24 2008 , mrs @entity3 booked a package holiday on @entity31 with @entity40			1
‘ throughout the holiday , mrs @entity3 was to stay in the @entity30 in @entity63 , @entity64			2
‘ at approximately 5pm on september 3 , she returned to her hotel room and went out on to the balcony to read a book , closing the patio doors as she did so			0
‘ some short time later , the telephone in her room rang and she got up and walked quickly into the closed doors			0
the doors shattered , causing multiple lacerations			0
they were constructed using glass a quarter of an inch thick			0
it was neither toughened nor safety glass			2
’ she added : ‘ mrs @entity3 said the hotelier ought to have ensured the glass was of such thickness that it did not shatter			2
’ but miss @entity56 then went on to warn the judges about the potential dangers of expecting other countries to live up to @entity86 standards of health and safety			0
paradise : @entity30 is billed as an exclusive holiday resort , but @entity40 were held liable for the sub standard levels of health and safety on the site she said : ‘ exporting @entity86 standards would give rise to lack of clarity – some nations are more risk averse than others			2
‘ if travel agents are told that facilities have to comply with @entity86 notions of reasonableness , that is going to create great difficulties for the @entity86 tourist industry in general			0
’ however @entity108 , representing mrs @entity3 , argued that @entity40 had rightly been held liable			1
he said : ‘ when people book a package holiday , they are entitled to expect that the facilities are not unsafe			0
’ lord @entity113 , sitting with @entity114 and @entity115 , has said he will deliver the court ’s decision at a later date			0
idyllic : a judge said that @entity40 should have made sure the @entity64 location was fit for @entity18 tourists to visit			1

@entity3 , 53 , won the claim against @entity40 for the 2008 accident
she sued because the door in her room was not made of toughened glass
ruling could mean greater costs for @entity18 holidaymakers
