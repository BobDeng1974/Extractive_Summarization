by @entity1 reporter published : 12:59 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 01:53 est , 15 october 2012 the reverend @entity3 ’s flock happily contribute to collections during sunday services			1
yesterday , however , he turned the tables			1
@entity8 , as he is affectionately known by his congregation , handed a £ 10 note from the church coffers to each parishioner who attended his @entity13 services			1
pays to pray : reverend @entity3 gave £ 10 to every member of his congregation who attended a harvest festival service at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 roll up ! @entity19 hands out £ 10 notes yesterday to each member of his congregation during a harvest festival service in return , the recipients were expected to use their windfall imaginatively towards acts of goodwill in the local community			1
his idea could be said to have biblical origins			2
some likened it to the @entity32 , in which a man shares out his wealth among three servants in a test of how well they can use it in the service of @entity40			2
@entity19 , vicar of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , said : ‘ it might be that they use that £ 10 to buy ingredients to bake , then drop their efforts off where they would be appreciated			2
queuing up : reverend @entity3 said he wanted to keep the feel - good factor of the @entity50 and jubilee going and encourage acts of goodwill in the local community take note : the @entity19 instructed his parishioners to spend the money on someone in need ‘ or they might take someone who is lonely for a coffee or to the cinema			1
i have given them lots of ideas			2
’ he expected to give out £ 1,500 in total but was keeping some money in reserve in case turn - out exceeded expectations			1
he said : ‘ we have had a very positive reaction from the congregation			0
i think they thought they would have stood out like a sore thumb			0
a few people have refused to take the money but said they will instead use their own to take part			0
it seems the wrong way round , as usually members of the congregation give to the church			0
’ reverend @entity3 expected to give out £ 1,500 in total with some money in reserve in case turn - out exceeded expectations the vicar said he felt the initiative might help sustain the feelgood factor left over by the @entity50 and jubilee celebrations			1
he said the church often gave money to big charities but this was a way of helping the immediate community			0
@entity19 said that he had faith that most of the money would be passed on			0
he added : ‘ there ’s obviously a chance someone wo n’t pass it on			0
but for the ones that do , it will be worth it			0

the reverend @entity3 told his flock to spend it on someone in need
he ' wanted to keep the feel - good factor of the @entity50 and @entity108 going '
