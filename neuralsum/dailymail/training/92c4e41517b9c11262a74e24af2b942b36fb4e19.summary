the slump would have been even worse but for the biggest rise in government spending for four years			0
it was up 1.6 per cent in the first three months of the year and was driven by spending on health and defence			0
@entity116 , a @entity117 - based economist at @entity119 bank @entity118 , said it ' questions how well the government is implementing the austerity measures ’			1
@entity124 , director of currency specialists @entity126 , said : ' the headwinds are turning into a hurricane			0
