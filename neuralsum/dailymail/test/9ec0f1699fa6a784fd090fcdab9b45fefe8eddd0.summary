@entity0 admits he has sometimes needed to spend time in a padded room after failing to get to grips with the challenges posed by @entity5			1
but the former @entity7 champion is optimistic he can improve on his @entity9 record this week after overcoming an ankle injury which forced him to withdraw from the @entity12 last month			1
' it was the third time in my career i 've had to withdraw from a tournament and it 's not something i enjoy doing , ' @entity0 said after a practice round at @entity5			1
' i was not really sure the extent of how much i had hurt myself and nearly withdrew from the pro-am on wednesday , and probably should have in hindsight			0
@entity0 has vowed to play ' aggressive ' golf to help improve his poor @entity9 record ' it was a peroneal tendon strain and , with a big season ahead , i did n't want to force anything			1
this is the first 18 holes i have walked since , and i feel good , so we are actually in better shape than we expected			0
' @entity0 has made the cut just twice in seven attempts in the @entity9 - although he finished 17th in 2009 and 12th in 2012 - and concedes the long course does not suit his game			1
but the 35 - year - old @entity35 added : ' despite the fact that my record round here is not great , i do love this golf course			1
i could easily play it every day and be very content			2
' it 's such a great golf course , you learn something about it every year			1
i was out there just picking up little nuances that i have n't perhaps noticed before and putting those in the memory bank and trying to apply your knowledge and experience and hope that some year i can come here and really compete			2
this could be the year			2
the golfer ( left ) took in a practice round with his coach @entity56 on the @entity5 course ' i am excited			2
i am really focusing hard on my chipping and putting this year			0
i have n't putted well enough here and it seems like such an obvious key round here			0
' sometimes i have required a padded cell when i 've walked off the 18th green because i have got frustrated , but i have learned to understand why the course frustrates you , because it makes you play with the handbrake on			0
you have to take it off sometimes and play aggressively to conservative targets			0
' that 's a sort of sports psychology thing , but it means you take shots on that you fancy and if you do n't like it you have to play safe			0
sometimes it can be dangerous to be playing extremely well coming in here because it gets you to take too much on			0
sometimes when you are a tiny bit off and have to play a tiny bit safer and smarter , that can be a good recipe around here so it 's getting that right balance			0
' @entity0 chips towards the green as his caddie @entity84 looks on during a practice round at @entity5			1

@entity0 will play ' aggressive ' golf to end his poor @entity9 record
