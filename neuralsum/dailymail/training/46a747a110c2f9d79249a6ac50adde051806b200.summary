while @entity1 was the name on everyone 's lips before kick - off , @entity0 was the real star of @entity6 v @entity7 - showing his @entity9 pedigree for the second tournament running with two first half goals			1
but the @entity13 forward was also criticised for his theatrics which saw @entity15 sent off , making his and @entity6 's task much easier in the @entity17			2
the 24 - year - old former @entity19 target coolly put his side in front after just 11 minutes , slotting a low penalty past @entity23 and scored @entity6 's third with a low left footed strike in first half stoppage time			0
that trio went some way towards matching his 2010 @entity56 - winning total of five goals in @entity58 , after just one game			0
but between the two first half goals , @entity0 made himself an enemy to the @entity42 for the wrong reasons - theatrically collapsing under @entity15 's challenge and then drawing attention to the centre back 's headbutt			1
golden boy : @entity0 slotted home his third to put him ahead of the field in the race for the @entity56 @entity70 - who : @entity0 outshone the @entity73 winner on a difficult day for @entity7 's star man @entity0 now sits just one goal ahead of @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , who all scored twice in their respective openers			2
the forward 's third goal also put him half - way towards overhauling record - holder @entity1 's 15 @entity9 goals			0
and while his dramatic fall and complaints about @entity15 's headbutt wo n't have adhered him to @entity7 fans , the 24 - year - old is likely to be more concerned with his impressive goal tally			1
job well done : @entity94 congratulates his match - winner as he leaves the field as a late substitute all smiles : @entity0 did n't seem phased by the criticism , celebrating with his team - mates after coming off			0

last @entity9 's @entity56 winner starts his new campaign with a bang
but his role in @entity15 's *sending* off had @entity7 fans *fuming*
@entity13 striker brought his @entity9 tally to eight goals
