scientists have discovered a link between cataracts and @entity3 ’s that they hope will pave the way for new treatments for the brain disease			1
the link could also mean a simple eye test might provide an early indicator that someone has @entity3 's , according to a study			1
the finding , by researchers at @entity16 , indicates that dementia might originate outside of the brain and be connected to the body as a whole			1
opticians : a link between cataracts and @entity3 could mean a simple eye test might provide an early indicator that someone has the brain disease a growing amount of evidence suggests cataracts and @entity3 's - both associated with increasing age - may share common factors			1
the discovery means diagnosing @entity3 ’s could be done earlier and suggests new treatment targets for the debilitating disease			2
scientists say there is a significant relationship between cortical cataracts - the most common form of the eye disease - and brain degeneration related to @entity3 ’s			1
after looking at brain mri findings a decade after an original eye exam , researchers found another link between cortical cataract formation and poorer results on cognitive tests given to patients			2
they then performed a genome - wide association study on nearly 190,000 dna sequence variations , focusing on a protein called delta - catenin			0
the protein has previously been implicated in brain and eye development , but not directly in either cataracts or @entity3 ’s			2
after further tests however , the researchers discovered an increase in another protein that aggregates in @entity3 brains and is thought to be central to the development of the disease			0
the study also revealed increased deposits of delta - catenin in lens tissue of autopsy - confirmed @entity3 ’s cases			0
professor @entity74 , of @entity16 , said : ' though much work remains to be done , a link between cataracts and alzheimer ’s disease supports the idea of a systemic rather than brain - limited focus for processes leading to alzheimer ’s disease			0
' this study gives hope that we are moving toward earlier diagnosis and new treatment targets for this debilitating disease			0
' the research is published in the online journal @entity88 .			0

link could lead to new treatments for @entity3 's
