tucked behind picture frames , inside bedside bibles and on top of toilet cisterns - one traveller is letting hoteliers know exactly what he thinks of their establishments			1
@entity9 professed ' comedian and hotel graffiti artist ' @entity13 has spent seven years leaving his mark on rooms on his travels across the country and world			1
it is not clear whether his ' art ' is considered cheeky graffiti , or irresponsible vandalism , but the 37 - year - old @entity23 insists he has never had a complaint from the establishment owners - perhaps because they do n't know it is there			1
the work of ' hotel graffiti ' enthusiast @entity13 , who has left his ' amusing ' mark on hotel rooms on travels over the past 7 years the comedy writer and performer 's hidden work have been secreted behind paintings and wall hangings in places ranging from @entity42 in @entity43 to @entity44 the artist scrawls cheeky , head - scratching and provocative notes on the back of wardrobes , paintings , and mirrors the comedian said : ' boredom is my big motivator			1
i tend to just write whatever seems funny in the moment ' the messages are often so well hidden that they may never be seen by hotel users the comedy writer and performer 's hidden work have been concealed in places ranging from @entity42 in @entity43 to @entity44			1
his work also crops up in locations including @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , and ' all over @entity71 and the @entity72 '			0
notes include ' @entity74 ' above a sink , ' @entity76 , @entity77 ' and ' this hotel was n't @entity79 , it was @entity80 '			1
while some may find his humour slightly tasteless , mr @entity13 , from @entity83 , @entity62 , says the inspiration for his unusual hobby came from a mix of childhood memories and boredom while travelling however , he seems to be aware that his brand of toilet humour might not amuse everyone the 37 - year - old said he has left messages in every hotel he has stayed in since 2006 mr @entity13 , from @entity83 , @entity62 , says the inspiration for his unusual hobby came from a mix of childhood memories and boredom while @entity98 37 - year - old explains : ' i have left messages in just about every hotel i 've stayed in since 2006			1
' i 've never had a hotel complain			2
i never leave something on show that wo n't rub right off , and the stuff that 's hidden just stays that way , i guess			0
he said he has never had a hotel complain			2
' i never leave something on show that wo n't rub right off , and the stuff that 's hidden just stays that way , i guess ' but the comedian said the only down side to leaving his gags concealed around the world , is that he never gets to witness the payoff mr @entity13 said he was inspired by a holiday in @entity119 when he stayed in a backpacker hostel and found travellers had been using the flipside of a tacky painting as a ' secret bulletin board ' ' i got the idea from a holiday in @entity119 back in the nineties when i stayed in a backpacker hostel and found travellers had been using the flipside of a tacky painting as a kind of secret bulletin board			1
' when i was a kid i remember my parents redecorated their house and let me draw doodles on the plaster before they put up fresh paper			0
' i was fascinated by the idea of the next tenant stripping it off one day and seeing the pictures i 'd left them			0
similarly i love the idea of people discovering the messages i write in hotel rooms and wondering about the person who left them			2
his favourite part of the process , he said , is idea of people discovering the messages he writes in hotel rooms and wondering about the person who left them ' boredom is my big motivator			2
' i tend to just write whatever seems funny in the moment but certain objects have been known to inspire ideas ; bathroom fittings , kitchen appliances , @entity168 's bibles			0
' mostly i just write in places that will only be searched out by the extremely curious though - guests rather than cleaners i suspect given that some of the rooms i 've stayed in obviously had n't had a vacuum cleaner run under their beds in years			0
he believes that much of his work may remain hidden because some hotels rarely look behind the mirrors and wall hangings he said : ' i suspect given that some of the rooms i 've stayed in obviously had n't had a vacuum cleaner run under their beds in years ' he said : ' i suspect given that some of the rooms i 've stayed in obviously had n't had a vacuum cleaner run under their beds in years ' ' the sad part of the process , particularly for a comedian who 's used to getting immediate gratification from a joke in the form of audience laughter , is that i never get to witness the payoff			0
' nothing would make me happier than someone sending me a photo of one of my pieces they found by accident , unless it 's the hotel management that is , in which case i 'd better hope i paid by cash and did n't leave them a deposit on my credit card			0
