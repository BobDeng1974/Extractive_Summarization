2014 has seen another 12 months of tantalising sporting action			2
from events such as the @entity3 to the @entity4 and @entity5 - there has been a plethora of moments that have captivated us all			2
@entity9 have captured these historic moments step - by - step through our own brilliant photography team			2
below , @entity9 's @entity13 picks out his favourite taken images from 2014			1
this image was used as a preview to the @entity31 in the summer			0
it ’s supposed to be a bit of fun with participating athletes dressed up in @entity37 kilts and kit ! i wanted the @entity20 team to look warrior - like and invading the @entity4 by leaping over @entity25			1
including preparation , planning and shooting this image took three months			0
athletes are spread all over the country and were involved in heavy training in the lead up to the @entity4 so i could only photograph them individually at their respective training camps			0
as these were all elite athletes it was impossible to get them to @entity25 , they only get one day off a week and the last thing they want to be doing is spend it travelling to @entity53			1
the @entity54 took place in september celebrating the sporting achievements of men and women who have been injured in battle this summer 's @entity3 was held in @entity62 , a local lad showcases his @entity64 skills on a beach ahead of @entity20 's match against @entity67 despite a poor @entity3 , @entity68 has since reached 100 @entity20 caps - here he visits his old primary school @entity71 of @entity72 , in @entity73 ahead of his century of appearances for the @entity76 @entity68 celebrates with the @entity20 fans after scoring their third goal in a 3 - 1 win at @entity53 in a november friendly at @entity81 this meant that the finished picture would have to be photoshopped together			1
i wanted it to be as real as possible so on the drive up to @entity87 in the spring for the @entity53 v @entity20 rugby game , i stopped off at @entity25 to shoot the background			1
i wanted a panoramic images of the wall so the finished background is made up of 6 individual images			0
all shot at dawn on a beautifully sunny morning the foreboding grey sky was added in later ! the individual athletes ( which included @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 ) were shot in hotel rooms , corridors , car park and gyms in locations from @entity107 to @entity108			1
all the athletes did a great job at visualising where they were in the image even though standing in a car park or bouncing on a trampoline			0
the real genius behind the picture is @entity117 , the creative retoucher , who was able to bring all the elements together and polish them into a consistent group image			0
the finished image created a talking point on the first day of the @entity4 which was exactly what we wanted ! @entity126 boss @entity125 ( left ) and @entity128 counterpart @entity127 famously nearly came to blows in october the managerial duo do n't pack a punch in comparison to heavyweight boxer @entity133			0
