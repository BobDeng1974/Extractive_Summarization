a neighbours ’ dispute over £ 16.99 wind chimes hanging in a garden has ended in an expensive criminal trial and left a police sergeant ’s career in ruins			1
@entity8 , a police officer married to a detective , was caught on @entity11 climbing over his neighbour ’s 6ft high fence , taking his wind chimes and returning to his own garden to put them on a bonfire			1
neighbour @entity18 , 42 , and his teacher wife @entity19 , 39 , had upset @entity20 by complaining to the council about fires he had been lighting to burn rubbish during house renovation work			1
’ the ‘ bizarre ’ row resulted in a day - long trial at @entity48 involving two barristers , eight witnesses and a district judge			2
father - of - two mr @entity18 , a construction worker who has since moved to @entity53 with his family , had his £ 1,000 travel costs paid from the public purse to fly in and give evidence			1
the total cost of the case is estimated at around £ 3,000 – with more than half that bill being paid by the taxpayer			1
@entity20 was found guilty of criminal damage by district judge @entity63			1
he rejected the policeman ’s account that he was reclaiming his own wind chime , describing @entity20 ’s actions as ‘ extremely strange behaviour ’ and a ‘ foolish escapade			1
’ @entity20 was given a conditional discharge , ordered to pay £ 620 and £ 16.99 compensation to mr @entity18			1
after 26 years in the force @entity20 also faces losing his job following the criminal conviction			2
he then removed the garden ornament , which he threw on a fire , before claiming they belonged to him the bitter feud between the neighbours was only settled by a day - long trial at a magistrates court questioning why the wind chime dispute came to court , district judge @entity63 said : ‘ sometimes i wondered today what we were all doing here at an overburdened court to deal with criminal damage out of a neighbour dispute over a £ 16.99 wind chime			1
@entity92 felt the matter met the public interest and i had to judge it on its merits			0
’ the court heard @entity20 moved in to the house at @entity30 , @entity31 , in august 2012 with his partner detective constable @entity98 and their two sons			2
the @entity38 had lived next door for seven years but were dismayed when @entity20 started burning doors , cupboards , carpets and plastic in his back garden			2
they complained to the council and were advised to keep a log of all fires and were able to monitor activities via a cctv camera that was previously installed for security reasons			2
in march this year they checked video footage – which was played in court – showing @entity20 dressed in jeans climbing the fence and removing the chimes from the paved garden			1
mr @entity18 produced a receipt to prove he bought the ‘ chimes of @entity122 ’ from a local garden centre three years earlier			1

’ he said @entity20 never had a wind chime			2
@entity8 told the court he put a wind chime in his garden when he moved there as it came from his partner ’s late grandmother and was of ‘ sentimental value			1
’ mr @entity18 said he was very fond of the wind chimes he was off work for three weeks with a knee problem and realised ‘ the wind chime had gone			1
’ he saw a wind chime hanging in the @entity38 garden			0
‘ i recognised it straight away as our old rusty metal wind chime			0
’ @entity8 told the court ‘ in hindsight i might have dealt with it differently but at the time it seemed a reasonable thing to do			2
’ adding : ‘ i had reached a tipping point with everything else that had gone on			0
i was 1,000 per cent certain it was my wind chime			0
’ he believed mr @entity18 had a ‘ vendetta ’ against him because he was a policeman			1
‘ i was very angry when i saw my wind chime on my neighbour ’s wall			0
’ miss @entity98 said they had decided to get rid of the wind chime because it had gone rusty			0
@entity165 , barrister for @entity20 , said in law no offence has been committed if the defendant holds an honest or mistaken belief that the property is his own			0
but the defence was rejected by the judge			0
after the case mr @entity18 said : ‘ i felt passionate about this			1
i hope people can see the bigger picture			0
it is the principle of the matter			0
‘ i would have paid my own fare to come over for this			0
we have a serving police sergeant who was prepared to climb over a fence and do something like that			0
it is an absolute waste of taxpayers ’ money			0
but justice has been done			0
’ @entity192 are to carry out a misconduct investigation to decide @entity20 ’s future			0
detective superintendent @entity195 said the public rightly expected ‘ high standards of behaviour ’ from officers			0
