this horrifying video shows the moment a teenager lost a game of chicken with a 54mph lorry			1
against all odds , the 14 - year - old boy escaped with minor injuries after being hit by the 40 - tonne truck			1
the incident happened in october on the @entity11 near @entity12 , @entity13 , and the clip has been released to deter youngsters from playing with their lives during the half term break			1
cheating death : this teenage boy lost a game of chicken with a 40 - tonne truck - but somehow survived it shows three youngsters on a grass verge next to the broad single carriageway before two boys began running across			1
one of the boys easily cleared the path of the truck as it came screeching to a halt , but the other realised seconds before impact that he would be hit			2
he appeared to change direction and try outrunning the lorry , a tactic which lasted just a fraction of a second before the hgv smashed into him - still travelling at 45mph			1
the boy tumbled forwards into the road , rolling over until he briefly came face to face with the driver			1
he then hobbled off without any sign of serious injury			2
the video was filmed by the truck driver 's dashboard camera , which showed the exact location and the time of the crash along with the speed of the lorry			2
the footage appears to suggest that the hgv driver was exceeding the speed limit , which is 40mph for @entity57 on single carriageway main roads			1
the limit was due to rise from 40mph to 50mph early this year , the government announced last summer			0
it is 60mph for cars			0
horror : the incident , caught on the driver 's dashboard camera , happened in the middle of the day in october frightening : the driver was travelling at 54mph on the @entity11 near @entity12 , @entity13 , when it unfolded impact : the boy 's hood flew into the air as the truck , screeching to a halt , hit him at around 45mph concerned that the boy would contact police , the truck driver trumped him by approaching officers and handing in the footage			1
police quickly decided no crime had been committed by the driver , who was described as ' extremely shaken '			2
the risk of death increases hugely once cars or trucks are travelling at more than 40mph			2
however , the number of pedestrians killed on @entity90 's roads has fallen almost every year for the past decade			0
some 857 pedestrians were killed on the roads in 2000 , a figure which had fallen below 600 by 2007 and fell below 400 for the first time in 2013			0
ranked by the total number of deaths , a car is still the most dangerous place to be on the roads			0
some 785 car occupants died in crashes in 2013 , compared to 109 cyclists and 331 bikers			0
gone : the boy 's legs were whisked out of shot as truck mowed him down tumble : the boy rolled over several times in the road before coming to a halt some way in front of the truck more than half of truckers now have dashboard cameras to help them provide evidence to insurance firms and police			1
the footage was released by @entity121 , which manufactured the camera which filmed the incident			0
sales director @entity124 said : ' it happened on a rural road with no witnesses			2
let 's imagine what might have happened if it had not been captured on the camera			0
' obviously it was a huge relief to everyone that this lad was not more badly hurt			0
' his escape is frankly remarkable given the size of the truck and the speed it was travelling at the time of the collision			1
he only had a badly bruised ankle			0
' we have released the footage this week during half - term to show the crazy risk a very small number of youths are taking by playing chicken			2
' i do n't think anyone viewing the footage would ever contemplate playing chicken again			0
' survival : for a brief moment , the teenager came face to face with the driver , who handed footage to police hobbling : the boy made his escape with no more than a badly bruised ankle , but left the driver shaken a @entity167 spokesman said : ' we received a call at 1pm on 26 october 2014 , reporting a collision involving a hgv and a pedestrian on the @entity11 at @entity172			1
' officers attended the scene			0
a 14 - year - old boy was taken to @entity176 with minor injuries to his hand and knee			1
' the incident was looked into and no further action was taken against any parties			0
