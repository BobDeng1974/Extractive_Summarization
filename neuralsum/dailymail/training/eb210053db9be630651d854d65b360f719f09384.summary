when she finally got an appointment for tests nearly six months later , in january 2010 , she received the devastating news she had cervical cancer			1

the shocking results revealed the growth in her pelvis was not cancerous - but internal damage from previous cancer treatment she had received ' i wrote them farewell letters to say how proud i was of them and told them not to be sad because of all the good times they had spent together			1
' she even had family photographs taken to remind them of her			0
' i wanted the boys to have fun times and lots of mum memories , like playing football together or having a barbecue			0
nothing that cost a fortune			0
' she added : ' i did n’t know if i was going to end up dying in a hospital , if i would be at home or how it would happen			0

she said : ' the doctor was there with the test results and my mum burst out crying			0
i just started to laugh			0
' @entity130 said " how can you laugh ? " , but it was out of relief , ' says ms @entity27 , an oil firm operations manager			1

despite this , ms @entity27 added she has nothing but praise for many of the medical staff at the @entity179 royal @entity177 unit , but said she felt let down by @entity31			1
