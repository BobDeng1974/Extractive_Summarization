by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 12:13 est , 28 september 2013 an ultrasound sensor kit could enable people with visual impairments to ride a bicycle independently			2
the @entity6 unit has sensors to give the rider constant directional feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side , via vibrating buttons beneath each thumb			1
the device , which is detachable and can be fitted onto the handlebars of any bike , was designed by electronics engineer and entrepreneur @entity18			2
@entity19 : visually impaired cyclists line up to use the @entity21 , which uses ultrasound sensors to give the rider constant directional feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side via vibrating handlebar buttons it uses the same obstacle detection capability in the award winning @entity30 , an electronic mobility aid that is used by people with sight loss all over the world			1
the @entity30 mimics the echolocation abilities of bats and was featured on the @entity38 documentary series @entity39 , fronted by @entity40 in 2012			0
the programme makers approached dr @entity18 ’s company @entity42 , to adapt the @entity30 technology for use on a bicycle that could be tested with a blind rider			1
mastermind : dr @entity18 , the inventor behind the @entity21 , poses with his @entity50 device , which uses the same fundamental technology @entity52 , who had been a keen cyclist before losing his sight , was shown on the programme steering a straight course through a heavily wooded cycle path using the first @entity6			1
since the programme , @entity57 has made the kits more widely available , to give groups of visually impaired riders the opportunity to try an @entity6 , most notably at a world first event run by @entity66 @entity65 in @entity67 , on a specially constructed cycle track			1
dr @entity18 commented : ' the @entity6 is not suitable for visually impaired road cyclists because road drivers assume a cyclist can see , so this is clearly too hazardous			0
' it is designed for use in a supervised and controlled environment and has great potential for use in sport and velodrome settings in particular			0
we are now looking at specific enhancements to the technology for this purpose			2
' sound @entity57 is currently working with sports organisations around the country to run @entity6 events			1
the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) and the organisers of the 2014 @entity89 in @entity90 have both already shown an interest			0
anyone else can go and see the device for themselves at @entity96 ’s @entity95 , where it is part of a new exhibition highlighting innovative engineering that transforms lives			0
the display an interview with dr @entity18 in which he explains how he approached the challenges of turning a ground breaking ‘ what if ’ idea into an engineering reality .			0

device uses same ultrasound technology as the award *-* winning @entity50
it gives riders feedback on obstacles ahead via vibrating handlebar buttons
makers now working with sports groups to offer cycling events for the blind
