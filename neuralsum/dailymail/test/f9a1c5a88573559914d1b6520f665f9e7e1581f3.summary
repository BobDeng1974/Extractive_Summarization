a former prison officer has claimed staff at one of @entity4 's toughest jails regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars			1
@entity8 , a decorated former prison guard at @entity9 , said staff would put inmates in a cell padded with mattresses and leave them to fight out any differences			1
the 49 - year - old , who worked at the jail for eight years and was commended for bravery , said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold , while others ' turned a blind eye to it '			1
he also said gangs controlled entire wings at the jail in @entity24 , south west @entity25 , leaving staff afraid to visit some areas of the prison for fear of being attacked			1
mr @entity8 told the @entity41 : ' it was like a sport for them			1
if two inmates had a grudge they 'd put them together in a room to sort it out			1
' they only stopped when one was knocked out or could n't defend themselves any more			0
' his revelations come after he left the prison in january last year , amid claims he was forced out for trying to lift the lid on the goings - on			1
he claims the in - fighting was often kept hidden from the overriding authorities , with the prison 's management setting up a @entity60 to ' fiddle the assault figures '			1
he said common tactics were to treat group attacks as just one assault and to encourage inmates to admit to the lesser charge of health and safety over assault			2
the former officer said : ' there would be 15 or 20 lads from the same gang on the same wing			0
they would protect each other , deal drugs			0
' and if they saw another gang member all hell broke loose – their wars do n't stop when they 're behind bars			0
' but if an inmate assaulted someone , the governor did n't want it written down like that			0
staff would advise prisoners to admit a lesser charge			2
' there were high levels of ' unpredictable and reckless ' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at @entity9 last year , a report by @entity94 found ( file picture ) claims from former prison officer @entity8 about @entity9 echo that of scenes in 1999 film @entity35 ( above ) earlier this year , it was revealed that inmates at @entity9 represent 48 different gangs , fuelling a ' constant juggling ' by prison officers to keep the boys apart			1
a report found there were high levels of ' unpredictable and reckless ' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at the young offenders ' institution , a significant amount of which was gang - related			0
around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the @entity25 area - were placed on so - called ' keep apart ' lists to tackle gang - related violence , inspectors from @entity94 ( @entity94 ) said			0
former @entity9 prison officer @entity125 pictured outside court ahead of being jailed former prison offer @entity8 was also among the guards who reported fellow worker @entity125 for performing sex acts on an inmate in his cell			1
@entity134 , a married mother - of - four , had sex with teenage murderer @entity136 , then aged 18 , at @entity9 and even wrote love letters to him , which included intimate photographs			1
@entity134 , then aged 31 , pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office and was jailed for 12 months at @entity140 in 2010			0
jailing her , judge @entity141 told her : ' you put the security of yourself and the other officers at the young offenders ' institution at risk and that is a serious matter			2
' it has to be prison for you , you can not in your role , break the law and expect to get away with it			0
' the number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous @entity94 inspection , but remained ' too high ' with 262 incidents between july 2014 and january this year , including 79 assaults on staff			1
some incidents were deemed ' very serious ' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a ' very determined way '			2
@entity9 is divided into two sites , with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site a , and 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site @entity174 mr @entity8 said he tried to raise his concerns several times internally before he eventually approached @entity177 – who was the minister for prisons at the time			1
mr @entity177 ordered an inspection of the prison in march 2013 and called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run			0
inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted			0
despite calls for an overhaul , @entity9 was named last year as the most violent prison in @entity191 and @entity192 by the @entity193			1
but the authorities believe improvements are underway and it is simply taking time to see the changes because of the ' multiple challenges that need to be addressed '			0
following the publication of january 's report , @entity198 , the chief executive of the @entity199 , said : ' it is clear from the report that , since the last inspection in 2013 , improvements to @entity205 have been made ; and we are grateful to the inspection team for recognising the dedication of the staff who work there			0
' however , and as the report also acknowledges , the young people placed in @entity9 are some of the most challenging of the cohort we have across the youth secure estate			2
' @entity216 is very much a work in progress , and will take time because of the multiple challenges that need to be addressed			0
' in response to mr @entity224 ' claims , a spokesman for @entity221 told @entity225 : ' these inflammatory and damaging allegations are completely untrue and do a huge disservice to the hard working staff at @entity230			2
' it is totally untrue to claim that staff have been complicit in any acts of violence , or that there are " no - go " areas within the establishment			0
' it is also absolutely wrong to say that figures relating to incidents at @entity9 have been in any way altered			2

former prison guard claims fights between inmates are organised by staff
@entity8 , 49 , said staff would put rivals in a cell and let them battle it out
@entity254 gangs also control full wings at @entity9
