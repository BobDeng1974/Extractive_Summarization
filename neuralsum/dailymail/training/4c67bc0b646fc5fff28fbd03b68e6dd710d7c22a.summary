by @entity0 @entity1 : 16:28 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:46 est , 30 december 2013 young people used to worry about getting friend requested by their parents on @entity6 , but now they should be on the look out for grandpa and grandma			2
a whopping 71 per cent of all online adults are now members of the social network , and membership among senior citizens has grown a full 10 per cent in the last year - from 35 to 45 per cent of those ages 65 and older according to a new @entity17 study			1
@entity6 has remained the dominant social networking site			1
eighty - four per cent of people who reported using just one site say their membership is for @entity23 's creation			2
growing : @entity6 is still the dominant social networking site			1
it grew to include 71 per cent of all online adults this year , compared to 67 per cent last year but competing with @entity6 is n't necessarily the game plan for other popular sites like @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , who have focused their branding on specific groups of people			1
for example , @entity27 , the online bookmarking site , is especially popular among women over men			1
thirty - three percent of online women use @entity27 compared to just 8 per cent of men			1
and the branding seems to be working for the sites , since more and more online users are joining different social networking sites			1
this year 42 per cent of users had taken up using two platforms			2
diversifying : another trend in this year 's report is how more social network users are branching out to more platforms ' people are diversifying their portfolios when it comes to [ social networks ] , ' @entity51 researcher @entity50 told @entity56			0
' the addition of a @entity27 user is not necessarily taking away a @entity28 user of a @entity30 user			0
' click habit : the study also tracked how often social media users logged into their sites			2
almost just as many @entity29 users uploaded and checked that site as did users on @entity6 @entity30 is another more specialized site that attracts a high amount of college - educated users since its purpose is job networking			1
it 's also the only site to have a higher percentage of users 50 - 64 years old than the 18 - 29 age bracket			0
@entity28 and @entity29 on the other hand are significantly popular among young people and african - americans			0
twenty - nine per cent of blacks use @entity28 and 34 per cent use @entity29			0
both had a majority of users in the 18 - 29 age group , 31 per cent on @entity28 and 37 per cent on @entity29			0
this similarity in user make - up is also probably why many @entity28 users are also on @entity29 , and vice versa			0
this was the first year that @entity17 released a social media matrix , and it showed a strong correlation between the two sites , with 53 per cent of users on one using the other as well - the highest rate of reciprocity for any two sites excluding @entity6			1
the study also looked into how often users check their social networks every day			0
while its not surprise that 63 per cent of @entity6 users check the site at least once a day , visiting rates were nearly just as high over on @entity29 where 57 per cent of users uploaded or checked photos once a day			1
and that 's good news for both platforms since @entity6 bought the picture - sharing site earlier this year			2
it should also be noted that all of the companies in the study , except @entity27 , are publically traded			2
@entity27 is estimated to be worth $ 4billion and is expected to go public at some point			0
the study was conducted between august 7 and september 16 , 2013			0
the interviews were conducted over the telephone by @entity119 of 1,801 adults across the country , 18 and older .			0

a new @entity17 study *revealed* that @entity6 is still the *predominantly* used social networking site
@entity6 membership grew a full 10 per cent this year among those ages 65 and older
but most of the other social sites are *geared* toward specific groups
for example , *33* per cent of online women use @entity27 compared to just 8 per cent of men
