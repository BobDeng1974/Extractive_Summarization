a @entity1 politician says he has created an entirely new country by claiming three - square - mile patch of land along the @entity7 - @entity6 border that neither country claims is theirs			1
@entity9 , 31 , a member of the @entity1 's @entity10 , is the self - declared president of ' @entity11 ' , which is located on the banks of the @entity13			1
the land making up the so - called ' micronation ' was apparently forgotten when the @entity16 which split into new countries following the breakup of @entity19 in the 1990s			2
mr @entity9 says that under international law he is now entitled to take control of the apparently ' unclaimed ' territory '			2
hope : if @entity11 is ever formally recognised it will become the third smallest sovereign state in the world , behind the @entity26 and @entity27 mr @entity9 describes himself as a @entity28 and says citizens living in ' @entity30 ' will be able to set their own individual rate of tax , as well as drawing up their own property and personal rights			1
founder : @entity36 , 31 , is a member of the @entity1 's @entity10 the anti-eu @entity1 politician says the idea for the state came from a desire to live in a country where ' honest ' people could prosper with minimal to no interference from a centralised government			1
all services - such as medical , fire and refuse - would operate voluntarily , with the overall idea being that the nation 's perfectly capable citizens would eventually work out the correct level of taxation and the right service requirements for a fully - functioning nation , without the levels being set by the state			1
' we really felt restricted			0
we really felt under pressure , ' mr @entity9 told @entity57			0
' we really feel that @entity58 needs another tax haven			2
we need a place where people can prosper , ' he added			0
during the phone interview mr @entity9 said : ' we could n't make our government lower taxes			2
i tried hard to tell my politicians that we need to lower taxes			0
that we need to lower regulation			0
' all my opponents told me , " you should have your own state to prove your ideas of liberty "			0
so i did it , ' he went on to say			0
after extensive research into areas classified as terra nullius , or ' @entity80 ' , mr @entity9 discovered the 2.7 square mile patch of land along the @entity7 - @entity6 border			1
unclaimed territory : @entity30 is located on the @entity7 - @entity6 border , on the banks of the @entity13 the so - called creation of @entity30 is far from the first time an individual has declared the formation of a new nation state			1
the most famous example is @entity91 - an abandoned oil rig off the coast of @entity94 that declared independence in 1967			0
although only two people live there and it has never been formally recognised , @entity91 has its own football club and national flag			0
even if after lengthy legal analysis proves ' @entity11 ' is a genuinely ' unclaimed territory ' , the world 's new newest nation still fails one of the basic tests for sovereignty			1
with only one citizen currently living in the country and access to the area strictly limited by @entity7 and @entity6 , there is no way @entity30 is able to protect itself from neighbouring states			1
even if @entity30 's so - called citizens were able to reach the country , @entity7 's border police still operate in the region			2
this means that even if @entity11 does exist , it is a failed state occupied by a foreign nation			2
he asked the area 's only resident whether he agreed to the nation - building plan and , upon being given the go - ahead , declared the formation of @entity30			2
if the country was ever formally recognised it would be the third smallest sovereign state in the world , behind the @entity26 and @entity27			0
with the motto ' @entity131 ' , mr @entity9 claims he has already received 250,000 applications for citizenship , as well as financial pledges to set up the structure of a state , including establishing telecommunication infrastructure			0
not everybody is so keen on the plan , however			0
@entity7 has already reportedly declared that it will not recognise the ' micronation ' , adding that although it is n't taking the declaration seriously , it still considers the declaration of a nation state ' virtual trespassing '			0
@entity1 journalists also tried to visit the territory last week , but were blocked from entering and the ' @entity11 ' flag that was initially flown over the area has apparently now been taken down			1
legal experts have also poured cold water on the idea , claiming that although the territory may appear unclaimed , it is almost certainly already part of @entity6			1
this is because after @entity19 's break - up , any land in the area not claimed by @entity7 was automatically absorbed into @entity6 .			1

@entity36 researched unclaimed land in @entity58 to launch a ' new ' nation
@entity1 politician named country ' @entity11 ' - saying citizens will decide tax and laws themselves and there will be minimal government *involvement*
tiny ' country ' lies on the banks of the @entity13 and has only one citizen
but legal experts believe the area is likely to already by part of @entity6
