he also came face - to - face with @entity73 ’s president - elect @entity75 , who appeared to give him the cold shoulder as he strode past the @entity6 leader			1
and @entity60 chancellor @entity42 seemed sombre as she spoke with mr @entity3 at @entity61 in @entity52			1
there had been intense interest in whether mr @entity3 and the @entity67 would exchange words or shake hands at the commemoration			2

he told great - grandmother @entity93 , who lost many family members during the holocaust : ‘ and now @entity3 is doing just about the same as @entity4			2
’ prince @entity2 appeared happier to see mr @entity22 at an @entity96 at @entity61 in @entity52 , where senior figures from around the world shared a platform in the sunshine while the @entity67 's criticism of @entity6 acting like @entity4 came in an unguarded remark with a member of the public , mr @entity22 has been more outspoken , warning further @entity54 against taking further action against @entity73 prince @entity2 kisses the hand of the @entity107 at the d - day 70th anniversary commemorations at @entity61 , @entity109 , @entity28 his remarks were seen as a reference to @entity6 ’s seizure of the @entity113 – the first annexation by a major power in @entity116 since the end of the @entity90			1

a @entity6 newspaper close to the @entity3 regime hit out at @entity2 as ‘ a clearly defined eccentric ’ , whose remarks were in keeping with his ‘ royal foolishness ’			0
but public opinion seemed to support the prince ’s intervention			0
he also received the support of @entity44 , @entity178 and @entity179			0
mr @entity44 said : ‘ i ’m not going to comment on the private conversations of anyone , least of all @entity2			0

’ mr @entity178 said the prince should be ‘ free to express himself ’			0
‘ i obviously ca n’t comment on a conversation which was clearly private … and i ’m not going to start comparing one period of @entity116 history to another , but prince @entity2 is able , i would have thought , to be free to express himself , ’ he said			0
‘ i have never been of the view that if you are a member of the @entity169 somehow you have to enter into some sort of @entity207 vow of silence			0
