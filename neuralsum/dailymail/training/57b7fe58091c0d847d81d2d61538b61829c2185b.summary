by @entity0 @entity1 's is to take on @entity2 and @entity3 at their own game by bringing @entity6 discount food stores back to @entity7 the exodus of middle income families to the thriving budget chains ended almost ten years of growth for @entity1 ’s and its response is to take a 50 per cent share in new @entity6 stores in partnership with @entity18 owners @entity16			1
the first @entity6 will open in the north of @entity20 this year with plans for 15 by the end of 2015 , potentially followed by hundreds more			2
discount supermarket @entity6 is to make a return to the @entity7 as part of a joint venture with @entity1 's that will take on booming rivals @entity2 and @entity3 @entity6 moved into the @entity7 in 1990 and built up a network of nearly 200 stores in less affluent areas			1
but it exited in 2010 , selling the premises to @entity33 in a £ 778million deal that was seen as evidence that discount chains could not survive against the financial muscle of the big four – @entity39 , @entity33 , @entity1 ’s and @entity40			1
but the tables have been turned in spectacular style			0
now , it is the big four that are losing billions of pounds in sales to @entity2 , which is growing at more than 35 per cent a year , and @entity3 , where sales are rising by more than 20 per cent			0
@entity2 has 500 outlets and is opening new stores at the rate of more than one a week and @entity3 is also expanding at a breakneck pace			0
the @entity7 discount sector is forecast to double in size to an annual £ 20billion sales in the next five years			1
the big four supermarkets - @entity1 's , @entity54 , @entity33 and @entity39 - are in the middle of a price war as their market shares are squeezed between discount retailers such as @entity2 and @entity3 and upmarket rival @entity59 @entity1 ’s and @entity60 are each initially investing £ 12.5million in the venture			1
however , @entity62 , retail analyst at the @entity63 , said the @entity7 relaunch of @entity6 , which operates in a number of @entity67 countries , was not without risk			2
‘ consumer austerity has carved out a growing market share for discounters such as @entity3 or @entity2 and both @entity6 and @entity1 ’s will be keen to tap into this trend , ’ he said			1
‘ however , @entity6 is entering a very different market to the one it left			0
@entity2 and @entity3 have expanded aggressively and established themselves as viable alternatives to mid-market retailers on both price and quality			0
’ the @entity6 outlets will be more upmarket than previous stores , with a focus on fresh food and an in - house bakery offering premium @entity18 breads and pastries			2
it has been praised for its cut - price lobster and champagne , but @entity2 has flopped with a much more modest product			0
its @entity89 came bottom out of 13 supermarkets in a taste test by consumer group which ? they were described by testers as ‘ far too sweet ’ , and scored just 44 per cent			0
top spot went to @entity40 with its @entity98 on 82 per cent			0
