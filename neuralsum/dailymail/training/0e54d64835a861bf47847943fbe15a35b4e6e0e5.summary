green initiatives : energy secretary @entity1 announced agreements to buy energy from 27 new renewable energy projects until 2040 more than £ 4billion in lucrative energy contracts was yesterday handed out to wind and solar schemes – but green lobbyists immediately insisted it was not enough			1
energy secretary @entity1 announced agreements to buy energy from 27 new renewable energy projects until 2040			1
the subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms , five solar arrays , two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants			1
mr @entity1 said the schemes will eventually power 1.4million homes			1
but parts of the green energy industry said they had not been treated fairly in the bidding process			0
the ‘ @entity26 ’ scheme , which will guarantee energy firms a fixed price for their power for 15 years , will be funded by ordinary householders through their electricity bills			1
the scheme adds a subsidy on to the basic wholesale cost of electricity as part of the government ’s drive to expand renewable energy projects			0
the subsidies will cost up to £ 315million a year - an estimated total of at least £ 4billion over the lifetime of the scheme once fluctuations in the energy market are taken into account			1
solar industry leaders complained that wind had been favoured by the government , despite solar being cheaper			1
@entity43 , chief executive of the @entity44 , said : ‘ the soon to be cheapest and most popular renewable - solar power - has lost out in a complex auction scheme that favours big players and genuinely established technologies			2
‘ is a policy that trips up the @entity51 ’s emerging solar industry really a successful policy ? we do n’t think so			0
’ @entity54 , head of project development at solar company @entity56 , which made three unsuccessful bids , said wind had taken most of what was already a ‘ minuscule ’ budget			2
‘ if properly supported solar will become the first renewable to compete with conventional generation by the end of the decade , ’ he said			0
@entity66 of @entity67 added : ‘ ministers should be investing far more on the @entity51 ’s huge renewable energy potential			0
’ critics of renewable energy subsidies said green power firms needed to ‘ grow up ’			2
@entity73 , director of the @entity74 , said : ‘ this industry is behaving like a spoiled brat - you can never give it enough subsidies , it will always want more			0
‘ they have to grow up and come into the real world and compete			0
’ windmills : solar industry leaders complained that wind had been favoured by the government mr @entity1 insisted the ‘ reverse auction ’ process - in which lower bids were favoured for the contracts - would save bill - payers a total of £ 110million a year			1
‘ this world - leading auction has delivered contracts for renewables projects right across the @entity51 , ’ he said			0
‘ these projects could power 1.4 million homes , create thousands of green jobs and give a massive boost to home - grown energy while reducing our reliance on volatile foreign markets			2
‘ the auction has driven down prices and secured the best possible deal for this new clean , green energy			0
’ the government ’s independent @entity107 estimates that green subsidies and taxes currently add £ 45 to dual gas and electricity bills – a figure that will rise to £ 100 by 2020 and £ 175 by 2030 .			2

the schemes include 15 onshore wind farms and five solar arrays
@entity1 said the schemes will eventually power 1.4million homes
subsidies will cost up to £ 315million a year , 4billion over their lifetimes
