some people may think that grammar does n't matter anymore , but there is clearly a quiet army out there of those who disagree			0
in the wake of a council 's decision to remove apostrophes from street signs , an anonymous guerrilla grammarian is going around using a marker pen to correct the punctuation			1
signs with missing punctuation , such as that at @entity16 , have seen the correct apostrophe inserted overnight			1
on the same sign in the town 's @entity21 area , an apostrophe has also been added to @entity23			2
grammar check : the @entity16 road sign in @entity26 where someone has added in missing apostrophes with a black marker after the council removed them marker : someone has used a black pen to add in two missing apostrophes to a road sign in @entity26 the local authority in @entity26 has been accused of ' dumbing down ' in the great university town over its decision to remove punctuation from street signs			1
@entity41 , director of the @entity26 - based @entity42 , praised the covert operation - although denied being the person responsible			1
she said : ' i am very pleased that someone or some people have taken it in their hands to correct this dumbing down			0
' it is further proof of how much people have been affected by this idea of getting rid of something as important as our grammar			0
' @entity26 is famous for the university and for people coming from other countries , such as scholars or business people , the signs without correct punctuation would give a very bad impression			2
' i have heard that the signs have been vandalised by the marker pen but to me it was the language that has been vandalised by removing the apostrophes			1
' apostrophe row : scholars walk in @entity26 is at the centre of a row over a missing apostrophe the council argues it is simply following guidelines from the @entity77 , where all new street names are registered			2
they argue that apostrophes are said to lead to mistakes â€“ particularly among emergency services			0
councillor @entity83 , executive director of planning , said : ' i think people would be more unhappy if an ambulance was unable to find their street			0
' @entity89 admitted that the decision could be reversed the ' next time we refresh our policy ' if national guidelines change			0
but he added that the punctuation of street signs was currently a low priority issue for the local authority following a raft of budget cuts			1
the @entity101 has reported that @entity103 's police and fire services , as well as the @entity105 , have no objections to punctuations in road names but @entity89 said the local authority would adjust its policy according to national guidelines			1
the naming policy also bans street names which would be ' difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell ' and any which ' could give offence ' or would ' encourage defacing of nameplates '			0
existing street names are not affected by the policy .			0
