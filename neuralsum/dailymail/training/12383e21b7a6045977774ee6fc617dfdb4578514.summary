by @entity0 @entity2 striker @entity1 received a bigger shock than his harsh sending off against @entity4 when he returned to the @entity6 dressing room ... @entity8 ’ glamorous presenter @entity7 was in the ice bath ! an exhausted @entity7 had been given full use of the @entity2 physio and treatment facilities after finishing a 250 - mile charity run via 40 football grounds in aid of women ’s aid			1
she had taken a bow in the centre circle during half - time			2
@entity7 was in the middle of a much - needed recovery session when @entity1 came back prematurely after being given his marching orders on the hour			1
sportingly , the striker allowed @entity7 to stay in the bath while he used an ice bucket for his post-match routine instead			1
she infuriated some of her @entity8 colleagues last march when she posed scantily clad for lads mag @entity29 when @entity8 were promoting women in sport			2
how long can the @entity62 justify their annual seven - figure spend on their 50 - odd councillor blazers whose travel and accommodation to all @entity68 games are met by @entity69 ? the @entity71 trip included dinner on the friday , lunch and dinner on the saturday ands a lavish spread — foie gras and all — straight after the game			1
no wonder the other unions have refused to feed the @entity81 blazers ’ partners			0
tradition : @entity84 has no qualms with the post-match @entity68 banquets in these days of elite athlete management of all nutritional needs , it seems outdated that @entity81 ’s rugby team still have to attend post-match @entity68 banquets			1
head coach @entity84 , has no complaints			1
however , @entity81 have brought in a strict 50 - minute recovery time for players after games this season to ensure they ’re not rushed off to dine with the blazers			2

premiership rugby were making great play that january 31 was the deadline for sorting out the @entity104 club impasse or they would go their own way			0
however , such is the dysfunction , the @entity62 high command in @entity71 felt under no such time pressure to find a solution with the @entity68 kicking off			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
members of the @entity112 all - party rugby team could be seen downing the @entity114 soon after leaving @entity115 on the 7am @entity116 last friday and were still going strong well past midnight in the bars of @entity118 in @entity71			2
in the circumstances , the side , led by scrum - half @entity121 mp @entity120 , did well to draw 10 - 10 with the @entity124 the following day			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity81 have got it clicked @entity81 cricket ’s over-reliance on sports science analysis is seen as one area where the @entity131 - led regime might have got it wrong during the @entity134 debacle			0
the array of desktop screens , laptops and tablets operated by two performance analysts in front of @entity84 , @entity141 and @entity142 at the @entity143 shows the appliance of science is of even higher importance to @entity81 rugby			1
busy man : @entity149 has given up his mail on sunday newspaper column @entity149 giving up his sunday newspaper column is the first sign - not before time - of him realising that his media commitments , mainly as the lead @entity156 plus his @entity158 ambassador position , do not sit comfortably with his role as an @entity81 coach in a @entity161 year			1
the @entity162 have prevaricated all season about taking action over manager @entity166 ’s agent @entity165 effectively running @entity167 having not passed the owners ’ and directors ’ test			0
so how long will it take them to rule on @entity175 owner @entity174 ’s controversial 75 per cent takeover at @entity176 ? this is especially when his advisors in @entity81 , @entity179 and the @entity180 are strongly contesting that @entity182 ’s suspended sentences for fraud in 1996 and 2001 were politically motivated , as was his arrest a year ago on suspicion of attempted embezzlement concerning the building of @entity175 ’s new football stadium			0
rule : the @entity162 are yet to act on @entity174 's controversial 75 per cent takeover at @entity176			0

@entity1 walks in on @entity7 in an ice bath after getting sent off for @entity2
@entity7 had completed a 250 - mile charity run for women 's aid
@entity149 writes his final column for @entity150 on sunday
@entity84 happy to continue with post @entity68 banquets
