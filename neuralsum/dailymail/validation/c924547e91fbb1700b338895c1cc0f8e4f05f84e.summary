sometimes i think the @entity2 clubs have to remember in which country their fantastic product is played			2
you can already sense there is reluctance to @entity10 chairman @entity9 ’s suggestion that we increase the number of home - grown players in a squad from eight to 12			0
we will never know if our players our good enough unless they get the chance and there are still people at @entity2 clubs reluctant to take that risk			2
talent is n’t always as obvious as @entity23 or @entity24			1
@entity25 has been phenomenal in attack at @entity27 since being given his chance to shine @entity25 wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal at @entity30 sometimes , as with @entity25 , it takes time to develop and that only comes with games			1
it ’s only a year ago that some at @entity27 would have questioned whether he was @entity37 quality			1
they ’re not now , but only because he was lucky to have managers willing to play him			0
@entity42 have @entity44 owners and , by and large , @entity44 coaches and they ’re world champions			0
their clubs and football association co-operate			0
we do n’t have such unity so it is no surprise that our international record is what it is			0
@entity25 has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the @entity27 first - team this season @entity10 chairman @entity9 ’s is looking to increase the number of home - grown players in a squad from eight to 12			1

@entity61 believes @entity25 is proof that clubs should take risks
he feels talent is *n't* always as clear as @entity23 or @entity24
@entity25 has spent many spells on loan away from @entity27
but , the @entity71 *striker* has now *fully* *cemented* his place in their first team
