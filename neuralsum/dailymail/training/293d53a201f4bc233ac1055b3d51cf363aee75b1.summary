by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 26 october 2013 it 's fitting that i am late for my first @entity5 treatment and have to run , so arrive perspiring profusely			1
the procedure – one of a new wave of devices that promise to stop sweating semi-permanently – was designed for those who suffer hyperhidrosis , the medical term for excessive sweating			1
it is the only non-surgical treatment to successfully tackle the smell of sweat			1
the condition is due to faulty nerve impulses sent to the sweat glands , and up to a million @entity18 are thought to have the problem			1
feeling fresh : reporter @entity0 relaxes as nurse @entity20 applies the @entity5 device to her left armpit patients describe having to change clothes more than twice a day and are forced to rely on prescription - strength antiperspirants			1
even these do n’t always work			1
more long - term treatments to date have been painful and costly – involving surgery to sever the nerves or remove the glands			1
@entity31 injections are also offered , but these are said to be very painful			1
now there is an apparently pain - free option – and i have been invited to try it			1
except that i do n’t have hyperhidrosis			1
@entity38 is being aimed squarely at ‘ the couture crowd ’ , who do n’t want to ruin their designer frocks with sweat - mixed - with - deodorant stains			1
as a friend puts it : ‘ the too posh to sweat			1
’ my excuse is that when your surname is @entity0 , it is vital to be as fragrant as a daisy at all times			1
no sweat : the treatment targets those with such extreme perspiration that normal deodorants do not help it costs £ 500 a pop ( with up to four recommended )			1
at a potential £ 2,000 , that is a lot of @entity59			1
but my friends are intrigued			1
to really test whether it works , i opt to have one armpit treated , and leave the other without deodorant for a week			2
but is n’t sweating something we are supposed to do ? well , yes			1
we are all sweating constantly			1
it cools us and removes waste from the body			2
we all have up to four million tiny sweat glands located in the skin			2
‘ there are two types of gland , ’ says consultant endocrinologist professor @entity72			2
most prevalent are the eccrine glands , found 2mm to 6mm below the skin ’s surface and dense around the soles of feet , palms of hands and forehead			2
the second type is the apocrine – 6mm to 8mm below the surface and found in the armpits and groin			2
these are activated at puberty			2
‘ @entity92 sweat is controlled by the nervous system , ’ says prof @entity72			2
‘ @entity95 sweat is down to sex hormones			2
’ when a sweat gland is stimulated – by exercise , temperature or emotion – it secretes a fluid of water , sodium , chloride and potassium , which evaporates to cool the body			2
it ’s possible to produce three litres of sweat an hour , but the average is half a litre a day			2
the smell comes from proteins and fatty acids in apocrine sweat reacting with bacteria			0
these days , we ’re all horrified by our natural smell			0
the @entity18 deodorant market is worth more than £ 616 million			0
but most of us probably do n’t smell as much as we believe			0
‘ i ’m quite sure that lots of people do n’t need to wear deodorant , ’ says prof @entity72			0
‘ @entity125 can be removed by showering			0
however , wetness can be embarrassing			0
’ the @entity5 emits electric and magnetic energy waves to target water molecules around the sweat glands , heating and deactivating them			1
as the nurse , @entity20 , pushes the probes round my armpit , i occasionally feel a prickle of heat			0
being extremely ticklish , i spend most of the time giggling			0
‘ it may take a few days to notice a difference , ’ she says			0
the next day i dress with trepidation , skipping my impulse spray			0
to my astonishment , nobody flinches on the school run			0
sniffing your armpits while jogging is not good , but after five days there is a definite difference between the two in dampness and odour			0
i go to a ball , and in spite of dancing for two hours , not only is my left armpit almost completely dry , but it is as fragrant as a flower			0
the right one is less lovely			0
a couple of friends i invite to ‘ smell my new perfume ’ agree there ’s a vast difference between the two			0
at a regular medical check - up , when my gp asks me to hold up my right arm , a whiff of personal odour nearly fells the poor woman			1
i try to explain : ‘ i ’m not wearing deodorant on purpose , it ’s my job			0
’ but this just makes me sound a bit insane			0
the treatment also works on the hands and feet and the effect lasts at least six months			1
some women report results lasting more than a year			0
‘ as it ’s in the preliminary stages , we wo n’t make claims about it lasting longer , ’ says @entity20			0
but i ’m very impressed			0
now all i need is to get the other side zapped			0
@entity5 from £ 500 per treatment , @entity184 , 0845 555 5050			1
