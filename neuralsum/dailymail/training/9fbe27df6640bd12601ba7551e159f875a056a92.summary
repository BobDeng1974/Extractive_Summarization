by @entity0 @entity1 was already proving a difficult child before it was announced recently that the hosts , @entity4 , would play in a qualification group - despite the fact that they could lose every game , not score and still be guaranteed to be at the tournament			1
previously known as ' the @entity9 for which it was harder not to qualify ' , the fact the hosts now avoid the perennial risk of two years without ' competitive ' fixtures means it can now be viewed as a custom - made chance for @entity4 to prepare for , then take advantage of , a home - based tournament			1
no doubt for excellent logistical reasons , @entity4 have been given a leg up			1
if there 's been less fuss made about this pretty bizarre twist than if the hosts were @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 , it could be because @entity30 football appears to be in an extremely parlous state			2
@entity9 stars : @entity4 and @entity33 will play in a @entity1 qualifying group despite already being guaranteed a spot as hosts it is the blink of an eye ago that they were rulers of the footballing planet			1
world champions in 1998 , kings of @entity43 two years later and within a couple of well - hit penalties of winning the 2006 @entity46			1
much of the way @entity49 football has evolved since the late ' 90s is directly linked to the @entity30 pattern of doing things			0
@entity53 's @entity52 drew heavily on crosschannel learning , while the @entity57 's @entity56 's @entity55 used @entity58 as its base model			0
@entity28 's youth development guru , @entity60 , often jokes that @entity28 sent ' busloads ' of young coaches to learn how @entity63 engaged in youth development in the 1990s			0
now , you can set aside the fact that @entity4 have needed the play - offs to qualify for two of the last three tournaments ( including @entity71 's basketball trick against @entity72 ) and their utter humiliation during @entity46 2010 because , at one glance , the domestic product shows a grand malaise			1
pitches are generally atrocious , the level of football is n't competitive , television revenue reflects the downturn in the product , hooligan behaviour remains a serious problem ( there 's an annual â‚¬ 30million policing bill ) and there is a panic about the quality of young players being brought through the ranks			2
even beyond the normal ' here 's a stick , let 's beat the ref ' nonsense , there 's a wide consensus that the officials in @entity4 are sub-standard			1
the government has introduced the infamous 75 - per - cent tax law which will hurt many clubs ; @entity104 's response is to refuse to move from @entity105 into @entity4 and thus not pay tax at all			1
when @entity110 thrashed @entity111 5 - 2 back in 2009 , the president of @entity4 's dominant club , @entity109 , warned that @entity77 was already in the relegation zone of @entity43 's second division and that @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity25 , even @entity27 , were pulling away			1
leading the way : @entity115 guided @entity4 to the @entity46 via the play - offs since then , things have got markedly worse			1
@entity118 are vastly wealthy , @entity104 are the rich young upstarts - the rest are verging on cannon fodder			2
@entity111 failed to qualify for the @entity123 , @entity122 did n't make the knock - outs , none of the other @entity77 clubs reached the last 32 of the @entity127			2
@entity129 critics queue up : ' the first criteria applied in evaluating a competition is the state of the pitches , ' said @entity134 , sports director at @entity135			0
' if you flick between the @entity138 and ours , the difference is shocking			0
rather than buying another player , clubs should be thinking about hiring some good gardeners			0
' @entity143 : the @entity30 division lacks the excitement of other major @entity43 leagues @entity148 : ' when i was @entity4 's technical director , i sent ( then manager ) @entity150 to @entity151 to see how they were doing things there			1
down there , youngsters of the same age are much hungrier than us			0
they 're more mature , much tougher and are prepared to get a bit nasty on the pitch			0
' no matter their route to @entity163 , there remains sufficient talent in @entity115 ' squad that , if the eversusceptible ' spirit ' is buffed up , they remain a dark horse for the latter stages			0
the real fears are for what lies ahead , towards the sprawling and now decidedly odd 2016 tournament and beyond			0
@entity174 , who thinks his country has n't just fallen behind @entity28 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity178 but even @entity179 in youth development terms , is the man charged with curing @entity4 's ills			1
back to basics : technical director @entity174 plans to rid @entity4 of its problem stars and produce loyal team players he said : ' @entity186 is a real problem - the strong identity that provides an anchor for young kids			1
' twenty years ago , @entity190 was getting the metro every day to work on the same exercises and training techniques used today			0
exactly the same ! ' even before that , @entity110 's coaches were instilling in him the club values			0
' in @entity4 , players are like consumers in terms of relationships with their clubs , playing for six or seven years before they even get to a training centre and having no understanding of concepts like loyalty to the jersey			2
' we will try to develop a less selfish footballer who plays with intelligence and creativity			0
' we 'd reached the point where the collective behaviour of our players had become a problem			0
they could handle the ball but , when it came to reading the game and playing in a team , there was a problem			2
' @entity224 chance , monsieur @entity225 .			2

since winning the @entity46 and @entity228 @entity4 have qualified for tournaments via the play - offs three times
@entity4 given the chance to play in qualifying group despite being guaranteed spot at @entity1
domestic game lacking quality of other major leagues in @entity43
