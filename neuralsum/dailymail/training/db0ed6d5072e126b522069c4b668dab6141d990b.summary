he started his career as an acerbic blogger , known for his heated feuds and his controversial penchant for ' outing ' gay celebrities			1
then in 2010 , everything changed for @entity8 when he fronted an anti-bullying campaign and decided to change his ways - promising to be a nicer and better person			1
but as the @entity16 born star fails to raise support in the @entity19 house , @entity13 questions whether @entity8 has now gone full circle			1
so , just four years after publicly pledging to become a more positive person , has the blogger dropped his nice guy image ? @entity8 was given a warning by @entity22 after telling fellow housemate @entity29 that he should be afraid of what will happen when he leaves the house because in the eleven days since entering the house , @entity8 has already earned himself the title of ' most hated man in @entity24			1
' and when @entity36 left the house on friday it was to audible cheers of , ' get @entity39			0
' since the start of the show , the blogger has made a number of enemies both among his @entity46 co-stars and in the outside world			0
his recent goading of @entity49 left his housemates fuming and his bizarre nearly - naked humping of the garden furniture caused fans to brand him ' offensive			1
' he was also given a verbal warning by @entity22 after threatening fellow contestant @entity29 - who had been making remarks about the women in the house - by telling him : ' i feel sorry @entity29			1
if i were you , when i leave this house , i would be afraid			0
' but should we really be so surprised by @entity8 's behaviour ? after all , this was a man who built his career on being offensive			1
when he started his website in 2004 - after failing to become an actor following his time at @entity70 - his modus operandi was to slate celebrities			1
he would regularly post unflattering paparazzi photographs with derogatory remarks and rude images drawn over the top			0
@entity8 broke down in tears over on - going fights in the @entity22 house @entity8 's bizarre behaviour in the house has been branded offensive by some of the shows viewers one of @entity8 's most controversial activities was to ' out ' celebrities who he believed to be gay			1
he was widely criticised for such behaviour , with gay rights activists claiming it could be detrimental to the the gay community and those he was outing			0
@entity8 - whose real name is @entity93 - defended his actions to @entity95 at the time , saying : ' i know there is some controversy about outing people , but i also believe the only way we 're gon na have change is with visibility			1
' and if i have to drag some people screaming out of the closet , then i will			0
' i think that lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , look at @entity112			1
' @entity8 was good friends with @entity114 until 2011 , when the pair fell out for unknown reasons			1
their feud is still ongoing and two years ago she accused him of stalking her @entity8 's alter ego was inspired by @entity120 , who he was pictured with alongside @entity121 in @entity122 in 2006 stars like @entity124 from @entity125 and the actor @entity126 - who were targeted by @entity8 - would later come out as gay			1
@entity8 's site was n't without its legal troubles either			1
in 2007 , he was sued after posting illegal clips of @entity132 ' unfinished songs			0
then june 2010 , he posted a @entity134 link to what was thought to be an up - skirt photograph of a knicker-less @entity137			0
@entity137 was just 17 at the time and therefore an underage woman in the eyes of @entity141 law , leading to questions being asked about whether child pornography charges should be brought against @entity8			2
@entity8 claimed at the time that @entity137 was in fact wearing underwear but also removed the offending photograph from his feed			2
@entity8 courted controversy when he tweeted what was thought to have been an up - skirt picture of an underage @entity137 , he also outed @entity125 singer @entity124 @entity8 is barely recognisable from his former self after slimming down thanks to diet and exercise he also caused controversy in 2009 after lambasting a dying @entity155 following reports the star had suffered from a heart attack			1
@entity8 claimed that @entity155 was faking his illness and that it was just a publicity stunt - urging fans of the late star to ask for refunds on @entity155 concert tickets			1
but the singer passed away later that day and @entity8 went on to remove the post from his site			2
then in late 2010 , the blogger posted a video declaring that things were going to change			0
@entity8 released a seven - minute long @entity171 clip where he claimed that his site was going to become more positive , even if it meant losing revenue			2
@entity8 is still friends with @entity174 , who attended his birthday party in 2010 he said that his work with the it gets better campaign - which urged celebrities to support gay teenagers who were being driven to suicide by bulling - had inspired the change			1
@entity8 said in the video statement : ' in the last week a lot of people have called me a hypocrite ( for working with the charity )			2
' a lot of people have said that i am a hypocrite and one of the biggest bullies out there			0
and there is truth to that			0
' i have on my website said things that have been hurtful to people			0
( but ) i do n't see myself as a bully			0
' i 've been doing my website for six years now and in the past i would justify everything as comedy and humour and ( because ) these are celebrities			0
' but , i do n't want to have to justify what i do anymore			0
' @entity22 fans have taken to @entity134 to speak about their hatred of @entity8 , with some labelling him the most hated man in @entity24			1
@entity8 continued : ' i am growing and i want to be a @entity209 ... and i do n't think it 's right to make fun of kids anymore			2
' i did in the past and i regret it			0
' @entity8 stayed true to his word - his website stopped using offensive language to describe celebrities and the articles became much more positive			1
he also overhauled his personal life			0
@entity8 - who was born to @entity222 parents - went on an extensive diet and exercise regime slimming down by a dramatic 70 pounds			2
then in 2013 , he fulfilled his dream to become a father after he fathered a son - also called @entity93 - with a surrogate mother			0
since changing his site , @entity8 has won many celebrity friends but he still has many detractors			2
perhaps the most famous of those is @entity114 , who was good friends with the blogger until 2011 , when they fell out for an unknown reason			0
two years after they first fell out , @entity114 was forced to cancel her 2013 tour due to a hip injury			0
she alleged that @entity8 had sent her a picture of her in a wheelchair with @entity241 written across it and a picture of @entity243 holding a gun			2
@entity8 in his official celebrity @entity246 photos before entering the house earlier this year @entity114 later accused @entity8 of stalking her after he was spotted out side her @entity122 apartment by a fan , but he denied the claims			2
he said he was only there to look at a new home and did not know that @entity114 lived in the building			0
after lying relatively low for the last year , much of the anger towards @entity8 from both celebrities and the certain parts of the @entity141 public had started to die down			1
but since entering the @entity22 house , he has attracted fresh attention , with his behaviour causing viewers to demand that he is kicked off the show and as he continues to alienate his housemates , it seems he has very much fallen of his nice guy bandwagon .			2

@entity8 started his career writing offensive stories about celebrities
he controversially used his *popular* blog to ' out ' gay stars
then the star did a *u-turn* in 2010 and promised to be a better person
but @entity22 stint has left him named the most hated man in @entity24
