by @entity0 published : 23:35 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 15:33 est , 3 march 2013 for squeamish people and picky eaters the appearance of a rainbow - like sheen on roast beef and processed ham has long been taken as confirmation that the meat is spoiled or tainted			1
but this commonly held food myth is in fact false			0
over the years there has been enough speculation about the safety of rainbow beef that the @entity15 has sought to set the record straight once and for all			1
beef rainbow : the @entity15 has explained that when light hits a slice of meat it splits into colors like a rainbow it is called ' diffraction grating ' and is due to the elements present in the meat on the @entity15 website under the heading ‘ @entity30 ’ , this strange phenomenon is explained to be in fact perfectly natural and caused by iron and fat that exists in meats such as roast beef and processed ham			1
according to the @entity15 , when light hits a slice of meat it splits into colors like a rainbow due to the elements present in the meat and this is called a ‘ diffraction grating ’			1
there are also various pigments in meat compounds which give it an iridescent or greenish cast when exposed to heat and processing			0
the same thing essentially occurs when light waves bend or spread around a surface and create a pattern , such as when the light hits the surface of a dvd			0
since the main color created by meat diffraction gratings is green , perhaps it is n't surprising that many people have traditionally viewed the color as a sign of spoilage			2
in dr. @entity65 's @entity64 , the character ' @entity64 ' pesters an unnamed character to taste a dish of green eggs and ham			0
the unnamed character declines , claiming to dislike the dish until eventually he gives in and tries it and discovers he likes it after all			0
light waves scattered by the regularly spaced protrusions and microfibrils in the meat send colored light in particular directions the rainbow on beef is similar to that found on a cd or dvd , while green has traditional been associated as a color of food gone bad through children 's book like @entity64 the rainbow effect is most commonly seen in cooked beef because this is typically sharply sliced against the grain of the muscle fiber , which , coupled with the moisture in it , creates an excellent surface for producing rainbows			1
‘ the reason it shows up in roast beef is because the cuts of meat that are used in most roast beef are more prone to iridescence , particularly in the round , ’ dr. @entity97 , executive director of the @entity98 , told the @entity99			2
so the next time you turn your nose up at a cut of beef in your local deli or that 's been in your fridge for a couple of days remember it 's probably fine			0
the real signs that meat has gone off are if it was slimy or sticky and have a bad odor			1
next time you turn your nose up at a cut of beef in your local deli because you can see a rainbow on it do n't worry it 's probably fine for you to eat			2

@entity15 sought to set the record straight about the *integrity* of rainbow beef
a rainbow - like sheen does n't mean it has gone off and is perfectly normal
the real signs that meat has gone off are when it is slimy or sticky and has a bad odor
