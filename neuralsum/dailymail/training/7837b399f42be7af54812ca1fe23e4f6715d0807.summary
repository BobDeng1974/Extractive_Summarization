by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 08:59 est , 6 september 2013 this irritable giraffe was clearly not in the mood for a close - up			0
and the angry animal made his feelings known to cyclist @entity7 , by stomping on his £ 2,000 bicycle			1
@entity7 and friend @entity9 were travelling by bike across the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
using a mobile phone , @entity7 first took a picture of @entity9 before the duo swapped round			1
and it would seem the creature took a particular dislike to @entity39 on the cyclist 's expensive mountain bike			1
he said : ' i had to jump off my bike immediately - there was no time to drive away			0
' ready to chase : @entity7 returns to assess the damage to his bike , but the giraffe has other ideas ' i met him as we came to a steep incline drove up when the animal suddenly appeared in the aisle in front of me			1
' he had a friend with him , but that quickly disappeared into the bushes			0
i waited for him to walk away , but he came closer			0
the giraffe was quite fast			0
' ' he has long legs and in what seems like just a step he can be right on top of you			0
' spotted : the cyclist sees the giraffe coming towards him and reaches for his damaged bike getaway : @entity7 picks up his bike and moves out of the animal 's way once the giraffe had trampled the bicycle , he began chasing @entity7 after the cyclist tried to rescue his bike			1
@entity7 said : ' just when i pick up my bike , he turned and started chasing me around the trees			2
he was clearly very irritated			0
the animal completely destroyed the bike , leaving poor @entity7 with a two - mile walk back to his car			2
remarkably , @entity7 has also previously been chased by an ostrich in the reserve .			2

@entity9 and @entity7 were cycling through the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13
pair stopped to take pictures when giraffe stomped on @entity7 's £ 2,000 mountain bike
animal then chases cyclist when he *attempts* to assess the damage
