@entity1 tourists are second only to @entity2 when it comes to nationalities @entity5 dislike most when on holiday			1
a survey of 8,100 @entity5 holidaymakers carried out by @entity5 travel operator @entity9 found that @entity5 viewed the @entity2 and the @entity1 as both loud and all too often drunk			1
in addition , the @entity5 complained in the survey that brits in particular were rude and had poor table manners			1
too drunk ? : a survey of @entity5 tourists found they considered @entity12 on holiday too loud and often drunk around 65 per cent of those polled said they 'd had bad experiences with @entity2 tourists , followed in second by the @entity12 with 43 per cent			1
@entity22 people ranked a distant third with 29 per cent for the same reasons as the @entity2 and @entity12 , for being too loud and too drunk			1
in fourth is the @entity5 themselves , with 18 per cent citing bad experiences mainly because of a tendency to block the best sun - beds at resorts			2
the @entity30 were close behind with 15 per cent followed by @entity32 travellers with 14.6 of @entity5 claiming negative experiences			2
they also also disliked the @entity36 for lacking table manners and the @entity38 for being rude and unfriendly , the survey said			0
culture clash : @entity5 surveyed said they had negative experiences with @entity2 and @entity12 more than any other nations - they quite like the @entity42 and @entity43 though but before you get the impression the @entity5 simply ca n't stand anyone sharing their space during time away , they quite like the @entity42 - 96 per cent of those surveyed said they had n't had a bad experience involving their neighbours to the south			1
another of their boarder - sharing nations , @entity43 , was next with 93 per cent followed by the @entity53 with 92 percent			2
in the same survey , @entity5 holidaymaker 's fourth biggest peeve when on vacation is ' people who steal the sunbeds by reserving them with a beach towel before anybody else gets a chance '			2
this backs up a recent online poll by travel site ab - in - den - urlaub.de that showed @entity5 had as little patience with sunlounger - hogs as @entity12			2
calling dibs : a survey found that even @entity5 get annoyed when their compatriots reserve sunloungers that survey 's analysis added @entity5 were also irritated by their partners , hotel food , @entity2 again , getting up too early and noisy children when they were abroad , with more than three - quarters of those polled saying they spend their holidays feeling ' on edge '			1
germans take around 70million holidays a year as a nation , but are far from relaxed despite all their time off			0
the survey found that most @entity5 abroad get upset easily - including 14 per cent who are annoyed by other tourists , mainly @entity2 , @entity36 , brits and other @entity5			1
but most of all , they fall out with each other - 58 per cent said they end up arguing with the person they travel with , whether it is family or friends			0
hotel food leaves 35 per cent of them seething , while 21 per cent can not stand noisy children in their resort			0
chill out : a whopping 77 per cent of @entity5 feel stressed on holiday due to a range of factors a further nine per cent resent waking up to blocked sunloungers - despite the humorous stereotype that it is @entity5 who place towels on sunloungers to reserve their spot			0
psychologist @entity103 , analysing the results , said : ' during their everyday working life , partners hardly see or talk to each other			0
' during their holidays , they hang around together for days and do n't have much to talk about			0
' it is mostly not until their holidays that the partners ' free time interests also turn out to be very different			0
so just one partner getting up earlier can provoke an argument .			0
