there were five thousand people in @entity2 , double the population of this @entity5 country town , for the funeral of @entity7			1
but the words of just one of them resonated around the cricketing world			0
@entity12 proved himself more than the @entity14 captain as he addressed prime minister @entity15 and the family and friends of @entity7			1
@entity12 was immense , as he has been ever since the tragic accident last week that rocked the cricket world and claimed the life of the close friend and team - mate he called his ‘ little brother ’			1
@entity24 delivers an emotional eulogy to his friend and ' little brother ' @entity7 on wednesday @entity12 pauses to kiss the coffin of @entity7 after delivering a touching tribute to his former team - mate @entity12 made as moving and poignant a speech as any sportsman can ever have mustered			1
his words conveyed the perfect mix of grief , disbelief , warmth and inspiration in the still surreal aftermath of @entity7 ’ death at 25			2
‘ i do n’t know about you but i keep looking for him , ’ said @entity12 as he gulped deep breaths and choked back tears			2
‘ i know it ’s crazy but i expect any minute to take a call from him or to see him around the corner			0
is this what we call the spirit ? if so then his spirit is still with me and i hope it never leaves			0
his spirit has brought us closer together			0
he always wanted to bring people together and he always wanted to celebrate his love for the game and its people			0
‘ is this what we call the spirit of cricket ? from the little girl in @entity70 holding a candlelight tribute to masters of the game like @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 showing their grief to the world , the spirit of cricket binds us all together			2
‘ we must listen to it			0
we must learn from it			0
we must dig in and get through to tea			0
and we must play on			0
so rest in peace my little brother			1
i ’ll see you out in the middle			0
’ @entity12 also served as a pall bearer as the coffin left the @entity88 @entity12 ( centre ) was joined by @entity7 ' brother @entity90 ( second left ) and father @entity91 in carrying the coffin the funeral of @entity7 took place in @entity2 on wednesday as @entity94 remembered the batsman a gathering which included the @entity14 team and greats such as @entity75 , @entity99 , @entity100 and sir @entity101 applauded an @entity14 captain who was joined in speaking by members of the @entity7 family			1
@entity12 was also a pall bearer at the service , as were @entity14 batsman @entity107 and @entity94 ’s @entity108 , who was batting with @entity7 when he was struck on the back of his neck by a routine bouncer from @entity112 and collapsed at the @entity114 crease			1
the hugely popular @entity7 never regained consciousness after suffering catastrophic brain damage			2
@entity15 was in the congregation , too , and it is the hope of the cricketing world , not least @entity7 ’ parents and his brother and sister , that he should in time be able to adhere to @entity12 ’s words and play on himself			1
he has already taken the small step of resuming training with @entity126			0
@entity12 consoles friends of @entity7 in the @entity5 country town of @entity2 cricket legends @entity100 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) attended the funeral after the tragic cricket death @entity99 , @entity7 ' first @entity94 captain , and his wife @entity133 arrive at the service for now an @entity14 team that would have included @entity7 will attempt to play on in the first test next week against @entity137 , who were represented in @entity2 by stand - in captain @entity139 and coach @entity141			1
there was no - one at the funeral , though , representing @entity144			2
@entity145 , a close friend of @entity7 from their time at @entity148 , attended privately , as did @entity149 , but there was no official @entity152 presence			1
@entity7 ’ family wanted the majority of seats to be given to friends and @entity2 residents so the @entity152 were told by @entity158 , in common with all the other test boards , that it would be better if they attended the state memorial service that will be held at the @entity114 in the new year			1
former @entity144 batsman and close friend of @entity7 , @entity145 , travelled to pay his respects flowers are laid on the pitch of the @entity114 as the funeral is broadcast live mourners stand with 63 bats , the score @entity7 was not out on when he was struck down by the bouncer a crowd gathers on the outfield of the @entity114 , where a memorial service will be held at a later date instead , @entity176 , the @entity177 ’s chief executive , represented the test nations at a service at the @entity180 that opened to the song @entity182 by @entity183 and ended with @entity184 ’s @entity185			1
meanwhile , at the famous old @entity114 , which @entity12 said will forever remain sacred as the ground where @entity7 fell , the service was broadcast on a big screen and 63 bats were laid out on the turf to represent the score he had moved on to before his final innings was cut tragically short			1
cricket will never quite be the same after this			0
certainly there will be a huge shadow over the forthcoming @entity195 in @entity94 and next year ’s ashes			0
but , as @entity12 said , cricketers will play on around the world			2
and the @entity14 captain will always be respected for his handling of a situation that no sportsman should ever find themselves in .			0
