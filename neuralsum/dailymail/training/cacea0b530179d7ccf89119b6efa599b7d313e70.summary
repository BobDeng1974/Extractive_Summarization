by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 28 october 2013 patients will have to sacrifice accident and emergency wards if they want seven - day medical care , @entity2 bosses have declared			1
after finally accepting proposals for supermarket - style opening hours in general practices , health leaders have sparked fresh conflict by claiming it will mean a trade - off with fully - functioning hospitals			0
critics have blasted the announcement as a contradiction that could serve to make the state of health care even worse			0
compromise : after finally accepting seven - day care , @entity2 leaders have challenged patients to sacrifice @entity24 the warning , laid out in a proposal released yesterday , criticised supporters of round - the - clock surgeries for naively expecting ' all - singing , all - dancing care '			1
@entity31 , author of the @entity33 report , told @entity34 : ' there is no question : for a smaller hospital at the moment , it will be very difficult to deliver that all - singing , all - dancing seven - day care			1
' that 's why you have to take into consideration a degree of centralisation			0
we 're probably not being bold enough			0
' rural towns would be wise to forego ' super deluxe ' 24 - hour care in favour of necessary emergency services , mr @entity31 advised			2
@entity51 , @entity52 , blasted the ' mind - boggling ' warning that forces taxpayers to plan illnesses around office hours			1
speaking to @entity58 , mr @entity51 said : ' it is mind - boggling that the @entity33 should suggest that a seven - day gp service can not be provided as well as fully - functioning hospitals			1
' taxpayers who are forking out considerable amounts in tax to fund the @entity2 can not plan illnesses around office hours on weekdays and should expect a decent service seven days a week , not merely when it is most convenient for doctors			1
u-turn : sir @entity70 , the @entity2 's medical director , has accepted research showing death rates peak at weekends when senior doctors are off - duty			2
he encouraged hospitals to implement @entity76 - style opening hours ' there is no reason why the service can not be improved to serve patients better , particularly if considerable amounts of waste across the health service are exposed and cut			0
' calls for more flexible quality medical treatment stretch back years , as research shows death rates spike at weekends , when senior doctors are off - duty			0
having repeatedly lambasted the campaign as ' utter folly ' , sir @entity70 , the @entity2 's medical director , shocked many by proclaiming it is no longer acceptable for surgeries to be tailored to staff convenience , leaving patients to suffer			2
in a newly published position paper on seven - day services , the @entity33 acknowledges that studies show death rates are higher among patients admitted to hospital at the weekend			1
it also notes that an inquiry into the @entity105 , where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily in one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory , found that patients felt vulnerable at the weekend			0
the statement says : ‘ improving care quality for patients means more staff , especially senior doctors , on site at weekend and evenings			0
’ @entity33 chairman dr @entity118 denied the organisation had made a ‘ damascene conversion ’ and added : ‘ patients should have greater access to high - quality care throughout the week and doctors should be part of the solution			2
’ but the proposed compromise has sparked yet another round of conflict , with critics warning specialist units would have to be cut so that seven - day centres can afford necessary services such as blood tests , scans , investigations and surgery .			1

@entity33 finally *agreed* to back round - the - clock care
but warned taxpayers must forego emergency wards for 7 - day ' @entity2 '
critics blast ' mind - boggling ' compromise as patients can not plan illnesses
