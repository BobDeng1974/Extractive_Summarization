by @entity1 reporter ambition : @entity3 says he hopes to write more crime novels than she did @entity6 books author @entity3 has revealed plans to pen many more crime thrillers and create ' a series ' that will run for longer than her hugely successful seven @entity6 books			1
the novelist , who has written two whodunnits under the pen name @entity16 , says she loves the crime genre because she can create as many tales as she likes for her character rather than be tied by a single story line			1
her comments come after her second crime novel featuring detective @entity16 , the silkworm , topped the @entity26 bestseller list last month			2
speaking at the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , the multi-millionaire author said she hoped to write " more than " seven books about the detective			2
she said : ' it 's pretty open ended			0
i really love writing , so i do n't know that i 've got an end point in mind			0
' one of the things i love about this genre is unlike @entity6 , where there was a through line , where there was an overarching story , a beginning and end , you are talking about discreet stories			1
so while a detective lives , you can keep giving him cases			0
' the bestselling author , who has been widely credited with helping to get a new generation of children reading with her blockbuster @entity6 , said she decided to use a pseudonym for her latest series to prove herself as a writer			2
she said : ' i wanted to prove to myself that i could get a book published on the merits of the book			0
' a friend of mine said , ' why did you need validation ? ' , and i think possibly you need to be a writer to understand why			0
success : @entity3 said she has always been a huge fan of crime novels and drew inspiration from the genre for her @entity6 , which was later turned into a number of major @entity72 films ( pictured ) ' i had known for a long time that i had this character in my mind , and that i wanted to write a detective series and part of me hoped that i might be able to keep it long enough , kept the story going long enough to establish a series			1
i just wanted something , i suppose , just for me			0
' and @entity3 revealed she has always been a huge fan of crime novels and drew inspiration from the genre for her @entity6			1
she said : ' i love crime			2
i 've always loved it			0
i read a lot of it and i think in many ways , and i think the @entity6 books in many ways are whodunnits in disguise			1
' i enjoy the golden age ( crime ) book			0
that 's very much what i was trying to do with these books - to take that finite number of suspects - the genuine whodunnit style , but make it very contemporary , make it up to date and make sure this is a credible person and a credible back story			1
