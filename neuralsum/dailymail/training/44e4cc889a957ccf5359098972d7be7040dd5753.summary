a satanic group unveiled designs monday for a 7 - foot - tall statue of @entity3 it wants to put at the @entity4 , where a @entity6 monument was placed in 2012			1
the @entity8 - based @entity7 formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the @entity4 grounds , including an artist 's rendering that depicts @entity3 as @entity14 , a goat - headed figure with horns , wings and a long beard that 's often used as a symbol of the occult			1
in the rendering , @entity3 is sitting in a pentagram - adorned throne with smiling children next to him			1
' the monument has been designed to reflect the views of @entity27 in @entity28 and beyond , ' temple spokesman @entity24 said in a statement			0
@entity3 : this artist 's rendering provided by the @entity7 shows a proposed monument that the @entity8 - based @entity7 group wants to place at the @entity4 ' the statue will also have a functional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of @entity3 for inspiration and contemplation			1
' the @entity7 maintains that the @entity43 's decision to authorize a privately funded @entity6 monument at the @entity4 opened the door for its statue			1
the @entity6 monument was placed on the north steps of the building in 2012 , and the @entity43 chapter of the @entity51 has sued to have it removed			1
similar requests for monuments have been made by a @entity55 leader in @entity56 , an animal rights group and the satirical @entity58			0
in response , the @entity59 recently placed a moratorium on considering any new requests			0
@entity4 : the @entity8 - based @entity7 formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the @entity4 grounds , pictured ' anybody can still make their request , but we 'll hold off on considering them until the lawsuit is adjudicated , ' commission chairman @entity66 said			1
the push by the @entity7 has rankled elected leaders in this conservative state known as the buckle of the @entity78 , who say such a proposal would never be approved by the commission			2
' i think you 've got to remember where you are			0
this is @entity85 , the middle of the heartland , ' said @entity88 , @entity89 representative for @entity90			0
' i think we need to be tolerant of people who think different than us , but this is @entity43 , and that 's not going to fly here			0
' while @entity24 acknowledges the @entity7 's effort is in part to highlight what it says is hypocrisy of state leaders in @entity85 , he says the group is serious about having a monument placed there			2
statue : the group wants the statue to go where a @entity6 monument , pictured , was placed in 2012 the group already has raised nearly half of the $ 20,000 it says it needs to build the monument			1
' we plan on moving forward one way or another , ' @entity24 said			0
another @entity43 legislator , representative @entity118 , called the group 's effort ' an insult to the good people of the state			0
' ' i do not see @entity27 as a religion , and they have no place at the state @entity4 , ' said @entity129 , @entity89 for @entity130			2
on its website , the @entity7 explains that it ' seeks to separate @entity132 from @entity133 by acknowledging religious belief as a metaphorical framework with which we construct a narrative context for our goals and works			2
' @entity3 stands as the ultimate icon for the selfless revolt against tyranny , free & rational inquiry , and the responsible pursuit of happiness , ' the website says .			0
