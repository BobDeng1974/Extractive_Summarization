by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 10 october 2013 the battle against baldness has a space - age new weapon , in the form of a high - tech helmet that promises to help grow your hair back with the aid of lasers			1
the @entity11 uses low - level laser therapy ( @entity13 ) - 51 low - level red laser and led lights , which the makers say will help to 're - energise ' and strengthen cells in the hair follicles			1
it should be worn for 25 minutes and even comes with headphones and a built - in @entity33 and @entity34 interface to help you pass the time			2
the average person using @entity11 will apparently first start to see less hair loss after six to eight weeks and the full effect after nine months			1
the @entity11 claims to have no side effects , but a fresh head of hair does n't come cheap - the @entity11 is priced at £ 665			1
this does , however , seem more reasonable than a full hair transplant , which can cost between £ 4,000 - £ 30,000			1
mane attraction : @entity46 famously underwent a hair transplant in 2011 , then a second procedure in june this year speaking about the futuristic device , dr @entity49 , hair transplant surgeon at @entity51 of @entity52 , said : ' low level laser therapy ( @entity13 ) is a safe form of light treatment which has long been explored as a potential resolution to genetic forms of hair loss common in men and women , like androgenetic alopecia or pattern balding			2
' it is intended for men and women with thinning hair or pattern baldness caused by a hereditary condition , and not by any other form of hair loss			0
hair today : the average person will apparently start to see a slowing of hair loss after six to eight weeks and some re-growth after nine months ' this technology is not particularly new ; it is something that has been around for many years in different forms			1
for example , for many years now i have recommended certain patients ( both men and women ) use a laser comb , which is a very similar device to the @entity83			0
' a laser comb like this also works with @entity13 technology , but is a much smaller device			0
from the patients i have seen who have gone on to use the system , i can see that it can offer some positive effects when used in conjunction with a product which stimulates hair growth like @entity95			0
' however , it is very unlikely that a patient who is losing their hair will see any form of major restoration by using the device			0
it may cause some of the thin hair on the patient ’s head to look slightly thicker and healthier , but the patient is unlikely to see any form of actual re-growth			0
' before investing in a system like this , it is important that the man or woman understands exactly what is causing their hair loss ; something which a hair loss specialist will be able to determine			0
' investing in a device like this may offer no long - term solution at all to the patient and it should not be viewed as a viable long - term hair restoration method			2
' more than 50 per cent of men over the age of 50 will have experienced some form of hair loss.the average number of hairs on a male human head is approximately 100,000 - @entity136 , men with fair hair actually normally have more hair on their heads than men with darker @entity140 to popular belief , hair loss can effect men of all ages , from their late teens upwards.the average @entity146 hair transplant procedure takes approximately 8 hours to complete ( depending on the number of hairs to be transplanted ) .			2

@entity11 costs £ 665
claims to 're - energise ' cells in hair follicles
takes nine months to work but results can *reportedly* be seen in 6 weeks
