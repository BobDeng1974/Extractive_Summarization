@entity1 head coach @entity0 will go into @entity3 third - round battle with former club @entity4 saddened by their fall from grace			1
less than 14 years ago , the men from @entity7 , with the likes of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 among their ranks , made it to the semi-finals of the @entity17			1
however , the intervening years have brought financial collapse and chaos on and off the field , and the recovery process is only partially complete			0
@entity0 ( right ) worked under @entity22 ( left ) during his time at @entity4 @entity1 manager @entity0 is disappointed by @entity3 opponents @entity4 ' fall from grace @entity0 spent a year at @entity4 working as then manager @entity22 's assistant between 2006 and 2007 , and retains a huge fondness for a club whose fortunes provide a salutary lesson			1
he said : ' it 's sad because i think they have got everything to be in the @entity36 - they should be in the @entity36 - but they are paying the price of two or three incredible years at the highest level			1
' it was well done , it was achievable , but as soon as they went down , there was so much money spent that to recover from that , you never know if you need three , five , 10 or 15 years and that 's why they are still paying that price			1
' all the enjoyment of that @entity17 moment - now it 's the other side , the darker side , and it 's not easy			2
' they are on the way back , but it 's taking a little bit longer than i would have expected , to be honest			2
' @entity4 currently sit in 20th place in the @entity60 table , just a point above the relegation zone and with manager @entity63 - the third man to hold the post this season - reportedly under pressure after a run of five defeats in seven games			1
championship outfit @entity4 are currently just one point above the relegation zone @entity4 have gone from challenging for @entity72 honours to championship strugglers @entity1 are themselves on a frustrating run of form , having won just one but lost only three of their last 10 @entity36 matches			1
however , a gruelling festive programme has left @entity0 's resources stretched to the limit , particularly at the back , and he knows sunday 's tie , which rekindles memories of the famous fa cup final meeting between the two clubs in 1973 , will be no walkover			1
he said : ' it 's a difficult game			2
it 's a tricky one because it all depends how the game starts and how good you are on the day			2
' we can not relax			0
we need to be better on the ball , we need to impose our quality and difference between a @entity36 player and a championship player , it 's as simple as that			0
' @entity1 midfielder @entity99 could face @entity4 after recovering from concussion @entity0 will be without midfielder @entity101 , who has a groin injury , but he has a ready - made replacement in @entity99 following his recovery from concussion			1
but three games in a week over @entity107 and the new year have taken their toll , in particular on defenders @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , and there could be changes , although the 47 - year - old @entity115 will pay full respect to a competition which is close to his heart			0
he said : ' i played in the @entity121 , i played in the @entity122 - i played in the cup in different countries and it does n't mean too much , i promise you			0
' here , it means a lot			0
we know how important it is and if you get through the first two or three rounds , you are there , so the idea is to play			0
' that 's why i want to play the strongest team without playing any injured players			0
we will try to make sure we do the best thing			0
especially at the back , it 's tough , but we will try our best			0

@entity0 's @entity1 take on @entity4 in the @entity3 on sunday
the @entity1 boss was assistant manager at @entity7 for a year
he has *revealed* he is ' saddened ' by @entity4 ' *plight*
