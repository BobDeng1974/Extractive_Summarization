miss @entity22 said she would like to see a comprehensive ‘ opt - in ’ system , where over- 18s would have to specifically say they wanted to be able to access adult images following a rigorous age verification procedure			1
the @entity62 is consulting on whether to strengthen controls			0

disturbing : girls have called the helpline to report that they are being pressured , coerced or even forced into mimicking adult videos ( picture posed by model ) in her article , miss @entity22 said : ‘ at @entity0 we are worried that we are hearing more and more often from children and teenagers who are suffering serious abuse from other young people			1
‘ we believe from what our callers tell us that this may be because hardcore adult videos are now just a few clicks away for many teenagers , and this may be warping their understanding of what is normal – so they are mimicking behaviour which is quite unacceptable and frankly disturbing , even dangerous			1
’ @entity0 was set up by @entity87 in 1986 to tackle the issue of child abuse			2
it is now part of the @entity46			0
' @entity92 ' : @entity0 founder @entity22 ( pictured ) says many teenagers are copying behaviour which is ' quite unacceptable and frankly disturbing , even dangerous ' the helpline said that during the year 2011/12 it carried out 641 counselling sessions following calls from children who had been ‘ exposed to sexually indecent images such as pornographic material and videos ’			1
this works out at more than 50 a month – up 34 per cent on the 478 total the year before			1
the number of boys contacting @entity0 about the issue has increased most notably – up 70 per cent to 268 in 2011/12			1
the @entity46 is campaigning for more education in schools to help children protect themselves on the internet , and more help for parents so they can keep their children safe			2
it wants the online industry to make a firm commitment to tackle the scourge of online porn , and says the government should legislate if the industry drags its heels			1
@entity120 , the @entity46 ’s lead spokesman on sexual abuse prevention , said : ‘ with over 4million pornographic websites on the internet , an increasing number of children are learning about sex and personal relationships through the warped lens of adult porn			1
‘ @entity130 sends out unrealistic messages and expectations and is a poor and damaging sex educator for young people			0
‘ though there are filters to block this material , they rely on users having the understanding and ability to activate them			2
putting the onus on adults to make a decision to view pornography online , rather having it freely available to everyone , would go a long way to shield children			2
’ he said it was also vital that parents and teachers get the information and support they need to teach children about caring and respectful relationships			0

they reveal how boys are increasingly becoming addicted to online porn , while girls are increasingly worried about the consequences			1

she called me sick because she came round to my house and i showed her some sex videos on the internet			0
' i did not like watching them at first but my dad likes them so i started watching them when he had them on			0
’ in her article , miss @entity22 said tougher action was needed from the web industry and from @entity117 to ensure children were protected			1
she said : ‘ the government are currently on the cusp of having to take a brave decision on how to protect young people from these videos			0
‘ and whilst filters and blocks are n’t the only solution , they are a big step in the right direction and an opt - in system can only be a positive thing			0
’ ' under pressure ' : @entity0 has received hundreds of calls from girls feeling coerced into sending sexual images of themselves to boys on their phones @entity0 has received hundreds of calls from teenage girls under pressure to send boys sexual images of themselves in a phenomenon known as ‘ sexting ’			1
many say they have already sent pictures and videos but regret it – in many cases because the images have been shared between the boys ’ friends or even put up on the internet			0
the pictures are usually taken on mobile phones and then texted or emailed to boys			0
@entity0 said it carried out 274 counselling sessions about sexting in the year 2011/12			2
many girls who take part in the practice have told @entity0 that they have ended up with depression or mental health problems , because they are humiliated by the sharing of the images			2
others regret taking part because they do not think they are ready			0
the @entity46 warns that girls are being pressurised into copying what happens in videos they see online , and then ‘ sext ’ the images to boys			2
they say the influence of internet porn means that boys are increasingly seeing girls merely as sex objects – putting them under pressure to perform for them			2
@entity22 , founder of @entity0 , said : ‘ young people need to know that “ sexting ” and being abused are not a normal part of growing up and that they have the right to say no. ’ a study by parent advice charity @entity261 earlier this year found that girls as young as 11 are taking part in intimate webcam sessions on social networking sites			1
and @entity266 of the @entity267 warned that the phenomenon of sexting was now so widespread that children as young as five need to be taught about the dangers in school			0

‘ we used to extend our education packages down to ten , they are now down to about eight			0
‘ we are realising we may need to pitch them at ages below that because this is not something that kids do when they are at home under the natural surveillance of their family – the phone is in their pocket and with them all the time			0
