with the recent influx of foreign footballers plying their trade in the @entity5 , @entity1 clubs have been subject to heavy criticism for not fielding enough homegrown players			1
the days of a full starting xi of englishmen are well and truly gone at the top of the table , as on average only 3.5 make it into their respective strongest first teams			1
leading the way with the most englishmen in their starting xi are @entity18 - who have six @entity21 players making the strongest team			1
@entity23 however , only have one regular @entity1 starter in goalkeeper @entity25 , and his only compatriot in the squad , @entity26 , is often overlooked in favour of foreign team - mates			1
@entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49			0
@entity51 ' philosophy of buying and nurturing @entity1 players has paid dividends to the club 's recent success with six players making the starting @entity17 @entity46 was sensational for @entity18 last season , a product of @entity60 training academy which has also produced the likes of @entity62 captain @entity44 who is still a regular starter for the @entity64 club			1
duo : @entity44 ( left ) and @entity48 ( right ) are both @entity1 and make the likely @entity65 top dogs : @entity18 have the most likely @entity1 starters with six , including @entity46 ( pictured ) @entity68 : 5 formation : 4 - 3 - 3			1
@entity70 ; @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 ; @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80			0
boasting a highly successful training academy , @entity68 have earned a reputation for churning out impressive young @entity1 players such as @entity47 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 to name a few			2
although only the latter is still at the club , @entity68 have replaced academy players that have left with @entity1 players such as @entity71 , @entity80 and @entity70			0
riding high : @entity70 ( right ) is one of five @entity1 players likely to start for @entity68 this season @entity92 : 5 formation : 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			1
@entity94 ; @entity96 / @entity95 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 ; @entity31 , @entity100 ; @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 ; @entity104 / @entity34			0
four @entity1 players : @entity106 , @entity101 , @entity31 and new signing @entity34 make the @entity92 strongest xi when fully fit			2
@entity109 ’s recent £ 12m capture of versatile defender chambers from @entity68 has proved a shrewd acquisition , as the young @entity1 has settled in to the team well with inspiring performances at both full back and centre back this season			2
new man : @entity34 has signed for @entity92 for £ 16million from former club @entity118 changing their ways : @entity92 now have five likely starters who are @entity1 , including @entity106 ( right ) formation : 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			1
@entity123 ; @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 ; @entity128 , @entity129 ; @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 ; @entity133			0
@entity134 : 4 @entity127 , @entity128 and hot prospect @entity131 all make the starting xi of @entity137			0
@entity131 is widely regarded as a potential @entity21 starter for @entity139 due to the 20 - year - old 's assured performances in the @entity5 at a young age			0
nationality : when he returns from injury , @entity131 is one of four likely @entity1 starters for @entity134 @entity146 : 3 formation : 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			1
@entity148 ; @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 ; @entity153 , @entity154 ; @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 ; @entity158			0
@entity160 ’s purchase of @entity149 from @entity162 side @entity161 takes the total number of @entity164 who make the starting xi to three			0
although @entity169 was left out of @entity171 ’s squad for the qualifier against @entity173 , @entity168 ’s inclusion follows an impressive start to his @entity5 campaign , keeping new signing @entity176 out of the team despite coming to the club this summer			0
arms aloft : @entity181 , pictured celebrating a goal against @entity183 , is one of three likely starters for @entity146 @entity118 : 3 formation : 3 - 5 - 2			1
@entity186 ; @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 ; @entity190 , @entity84 / @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity35 / @entity194 ; @entity195 , @entity196			0
although boasting the new @entity33 captain @entity35 , this @entity118 side under @entity199 only boasts three starting englishmen			2
a far cry from the class of ’ 92 , with only @entity187 , @entity84 and @entity35 making the @entity17 assuming every player is fit			0
captain fantastic : @entity21 skipper @entity35 is one of just three likely @entity1 starters for @entity118 @entity206 : 2 formation : 4 - 3 - 3			1
@entity208 ; @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 ; @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 ; @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218			0
the only two @entity1 players which make @entity206 ’s starting xi are centre - back pairing @entity210 and @entity211			2
apart from the defensive duo , @entity222 ’s @entity206 do n’t have a single other @entity1 player in their full squad , meaning they have the second fewest in the top eight			2
defensive duo : centre - backs @entity210 ( left ) and @entity211 ( right ) are just two @entity1 starters for @entity206 @entity23 : 1 formation : 4 - 4 - 2			1
@entity25 ; @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 ; @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 ; @entity239 , @entity240			0
@entity23 ’s sole @entity1 inclusion in their best starting xi is no 1 @entity25			1
@entity25 bucks the trend of englishmen being replaced by foreign players by holding the @entity23 no 1 jersey for the last four seasons , making 190 appearances			2
all alone : @entity23 goalkeeper is the only @entity1 likely to start for @entity251 's side			1

top eight @entity5 clubs average 3.5 englishmen per starting team
@entity18 have most potential starters with six , @entity68 have five
@entity92 have five , @entity134 three , @entity206 two and @entity146 three
@entity118 are likely to start just three englishmen in strongest side
@entity23 only have @entity25 as a likely @entity1 starter
