by @entity0 it has become one of the most controversial topics in the world of travel – the presence of giant cruise ships in @entity8 , and fears over the harm these liners may cause to the famous city			1
and the battle lines have long been drawn			0
for the cruise industry , the great @entity15 island citadel is one of the world ’s foremost destinations – a place that adds an elegance and a sense of history to any long voyage			2
no more : @entity27 winners @entity25 and @entity28 are calling for a ban on cruise ships in @entity8 size versus substance : the presence of large cruise ships in @entity8 has become increasingly controversial on the other side are those who think the liners are enormous , incongruous intruders into a place that was never designed to host such ocean goliaths			1
now , a powerful band of celebrities – including @entity44 icons , writers , fashion designers , a-list journalists , architects and royals - have thrown their weight behind an appeal to have the liners banished from @entity8 on a permanent basis			1
taking a firm stand : film stars sir @entity55 and @entity57 have added their names to the petition making their point : other @entity44 stars , including @entity63 and @entity64 , have signed the letter leading figures from the world of cinema – including @entity27 winners @entity28 , @entity70 and @entity25 – have added their signatures to a petition , addressed to the @entity15 prime minister and the @entity15 minister of culture and tourism , calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as @entity80			1
other big - screen figures are also on the list of endorsees , including @entity84 , @entity57 , sir @entity55 , @entity85 , @entity64 and @entity86			0
@entity87 , whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller @entity90 – was set in @entity8 , is another of the cinema set to add her voice			2
no big ships : demonstrators have been increasingly vocal about the presence of cruise ships in @entity8 other luminaries include architect sir @entity98 , @entity100 editor @entity99 and princess @entity101 – plus an illustrious line - up of fashion designers including @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
all these names appear on a plea sent to @entity15 prime minister @entity110 and his culture minister @entity111			0
making a splash : opponents of cruise ships in @entity8 protested in the @entity115 last year it reads : ' dear prime minister , dear minister , having prevailed against flood , pestilence , and war for more than thirteen centuries , @entity8 , the @entity123 , and unparalleled @entity125 word heritage site , now , in a moment of relative tranquility , finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners , indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe			1
since the flood of 1966 , @entity15 and countless @entity15 and international supporters have contributed to the defense of the world 's most fragile city , eternally subject to destruction			2
the absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction , of one of humanity ’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable			0
we urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the @entity150 in front of @entity152 and along the @entity115 putting an end to this senseless devastation			0
' the letter is first signed by @entity156 , who is described as the ‘ chairman of the @entity158 for the @entity159 , ’ and ‘ co-manager of the @entity161 with @entity125 ’			0
not so ship - shape ? when bigger liners approach @entity8 , the buildings of the medieval city seem dwarfed @entity8 has already made moves to restrict the movements of cruise ships in its waters			1
january brought a reduction of 20 per cent on the number of ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes authorised to enter the @entity115 ( the waterway which separates the main core of @entity8 from the separate island of @entity115 , immediately to the south )			0
sailing into the past : will images such as this soon be consigned to yesteryear ? further regulations which were due to come into force in november , have now been put back to january 2015			0
these will see the biggest cruise ships – liners of over 96,000 tonnes – banned from sailing in the @entity115			1
the proposals , announced late last year , were hailed as a triumph by the mayor of @entity8 , @entity188			0
calming the storm - for now : restrictions on cruise ships in @entity8 were introduced earlier this year ‘ finally , the trend towards gigantic ships has been turned around , ’ mr @entity188 commented			1
‘ we have had enough of these mega cruise ships just metres away from @entity152			2
‘ from now on , there will be clear limits on the size of ships that can enter @entity8			0
