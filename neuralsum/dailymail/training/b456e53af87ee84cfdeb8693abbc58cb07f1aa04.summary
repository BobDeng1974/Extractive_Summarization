next year , sir @entity1 ’s @entity0 is expected to begin taking paying customers to space for around £ 150,000 a ticket			1
but if you ca n't afford that , one company has a cheaper alternative - @entity9 is offering balloon flights to the ‘ edge of space ’ for £ 45,000 ( $ 75,000 )			1
beginning in 2016 , the @entity12 - based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles ( 30 kilometres ) - and it has just set a world record to prove the system works			1
the @entity27 capsule will launch from a site in @entity30			0
it sits in a launch cradle , where passengers and crew can climb inside			0
a high - tech balloon then inflates with helium and then lifts off			1
in one - and - a - half to two hours the capsule ascends to just over 19 miles ( 30 kilometres ) , atop ’ 99 per cent of @entity44 ’s atmosphere ’ according to @entity9			1
here , for two hours the capsule will float , letting passengers view out the window , get a drink from the bar and share pictures on social media with on - board internet			2
@entity53 is then vented from the balloon before the parafoil , called the @entity56 , releases from the balloon			0
this then glides the capsule back to the ground			0
the @entity62 can then be taken back to the launch site , which may be as much as 300 miles ( 480 kilometres ) away , for another flight			0
the total flight time is five to six hours			0
the test validated the full flight profile of the spaceflight system , lifting a model of the eventual system scaled down to ten per cent to 120,000 feet ( 36,000 metres ) and back down to 50,000 feet ( 15,000 metres )			0
the parafoil was successfully executed , breaking the world record			2
this allowed for further validation of the precision guided landing system of the space vehicle			0
in 2016 the parafoil , together with a high - altitude balloon , will be used to take pressurised capsules known as ‘ voyagers ’ on trips to the edge of space			1
this will give six passengers , along with two crew members , two hours of ' cruising ' during which they will be free to stroll around the ‘ luxury ’ capsule - which even has a bar and internet access			1
while passengers will not experience any weightlessness on the flight like @entity0 , the trip will be significantly longer than the latter 's six minute projected flight time			2
for the money - conscious , that means a minute of observing the curvature of @entity44 from @entity104 's @entity27 capsule will cost £ 370 ( $ 625 )			1
@entity0 's @entity105 , meanwhile , sets you back £ 1,650 ( $ 2,800 ) a minute			2
beginning in 2016 , the @entity12 - based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles ( 30 kilometres )			1
on 18 june they launched a parafoil ( right ) with a high - altitude balloon ( left ) from @entity29 in @entity30 on a flight that lasted 5 hours , breaking an altitude world record next year sir @entity1 's @entity0 ( pictured ) will begin taking paying customers to space for what is now £ 150,000 ( $ 250,000 ) a ticket , whereas @entity9 is offering balloon flights to the ' edge of space ' for £ 45,000 ( $ 75,000 ) with windows on all sides , guests above the @entity27 will be given 360 - degree vistas of the curvature of the world below			1
of course , the flight of the @entity27 does n't reach the official boundary of space , which stands at 62 miles ( 100 kilometres ) , but it will still enable passengers to see @entity44 fall away beneath them			0
upon completion of the flight , the parafoil detaches from the high - altitude balloon and glides the capsule back safely to a landing on @entity44			1
according to the company , the capsule will also give ‘ unprecedented and affordable access to the near - space environment ’ for educators , researchers , private companies and government agencies			0
‘ we could n't be any more excited about the results from this test flight , ’ said @entity146 , ceo of @entity9			0
‘ it represents a foundational achievement that moves us one step closer to offering a life - changing experience to our voyagers			0
’ the test flight represented the maiden voyage of @entity9 's @entity157 vehicle , a reusable commercial craft that enables research opportunities in fields including communications , surveillance , remote sensing and first response			2
this will give six passengers , along with two crewmembers , two hours of ' cruising ' during which they will be free to stroll around the ' luxury ' capsule ( illustration shown ) , which even has a bar and internet access			2
while the passengers will not experience any weightlessness they will still be afforded views of @entity44 with windows on all sides , guests aboard @entity27 will be given 360 - degree vistas of the curvature of the world below ( illustration shown ) , although the flight of the @entity27 does n't reach the official boundary of space , which stands at 62 miles ( 100 kilometres )			1

@entity12 's @entity9 is offering high - altitude balloon flights
the company has completed a world record test to begin flying in 2016
at £ 45,000 ( $ 75,000 ) a ticket , it 's less than a third of the cost of @entity0
@entity9 will take paying customers on two - hour flights up to 19 miles
here they will be free to stroll a capsule and order drinks from a bar while viewing the curvature of @entity44 below
