by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s first female warship commander is facing the sack over claims of an on - board affair with one of her crewmates			1
while the alleged affair is being investigated , @entity9 , 42 , will retain her position as commander of @entity13			1
if the claims against her are proven , commander @entity14 could face a formal warning , reassignment or even termination of her two decades of @entity2 service			1
the @entity27 has refused to disclose whether he has retained his responsibilities or if he , too , has been removed from the ship			0
it is not known if he is married			0
@entity14 became the first woman to take charge of a frontline warship in the @entity2 ’s 500 - year history in 2012			1
when she was promoted , @entity14 revealed that her job had damaged her marriage to @entity2 helicopter pilot @entity38 – which broke down in 2006 – saying : ‘ my husband used to be in the @entity2 and all that time apart is a challenge			1
‘ people who prosper in the armed forces tend to put their job as the priority , which is n’t the best thing for a happy married life			0
’ but despite sacrificing her relationship to focus on her trailblazing role , @entity50 , from @entity51 , is now facing the prospect of losing her job on @entity13 , after allegedly having an affair with a male officer under her command			1
her 43 - year - old ex-husband now has a son with his new partner in @entity61 , where he flies a search and rescue helicopter for the coastguard			1
pilot : @entity14 's ex-husband @entity38			1
right , @entity67 warship @entity13 on the @entity68 yesterday the pilot insisted he had nothing to say about his former wife , who earlier this year claimed that her job left her unable to hold down a relationship			2
@entity14 , who does not have children , said in an earlier interview : ‘ years at sea probably explains why i ’m single			2
’ name : @entity13 operator : @entity2 ordered : february 1996 builder : @entity80 , sponsored by : lady @entity81 homeport : @entity83 , @entity84 length : 133 m ( 436 ft 4 in ) @entity86 : 16.1 m ( 52 ft 10 in ) draught : 7.3 m ( 23 ft 9 in ) speed : in excess of 28 kn ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) she even joked that she should advertise her mobile number ‘ to get a date ’			2
however if the allegations are true , she started seeing a subordinate during the seven - month tour of her frigate , which has been conducting anti-narcotics patrols in the @entity98			0
this would breach the @entity101 ’ code of @entity102 , which prohibits personnel from relationships which compromise ‘ operational effectiveness ’			0
yesterday former head of the @entity2 admiral @entity107 , who is not related to the captain , said : ‘ if she had a relationship with someone under her command then she ’s rather let down other women in the @entity2 , because there are people who will jump on this and say this is why women should n’t be on ship			2
’ he added : ‘ the rules banning relationships in the chain of command exist for a very good reason			0
if the allegations are true i doubt commander @entity14 will continue in her post or be given another ship to command			2
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of an allegation of a breach of the code of @entity102 which we are treating seriously			0
it would be inappropriate to comment further			0

the male officer , who is not named , may also face disciplinary action
