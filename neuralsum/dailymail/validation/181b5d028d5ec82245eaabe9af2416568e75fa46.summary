spacewalking astronauts who ventured out for the third time in just over a week on sunday have completed an extensive , tricky cable job at the @entity3			1
but , dramatically , right before sunday 's spacewalk , engineers spotted problems with @entity9 astronaut @entity8 's suit			2
while it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks , on sunday morning , a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out			1
@entity38 told @entity8 that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven - hour excursion			0
meanwhile , @entity24 said a small amount of water got into @entity9 astronaut @entity15 helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized on wednesday			1
they were forced to spend two days analyzing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week			1
engineers concluded it was the result of condensation , and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit			0
@entity15 was never in danger , according to @entity24 , so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks , friday , to install cable			1
but in 2013 , another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet			0
duties : @entity24 said another main part of the astronauts task was to route 400 feet ( 121 meters ) of cable @entity68 : in this file image made from video provided by @entity24 , astronaut @entity15 points to his helmet as he sits inside the @entity3 on wednesday , feb. 25 , 2015 , during an inspection for water in his suit			1
@entity75 reported the water while he waited in the air lock for wednesday 's spacewalk to formally conclude spacewalk : @entity24 on friday cleared @entity75 ' spacesuit , pictured , for the last of three spacewalks to install cable @entity84 astronaut , @entity83 , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk			1
the water escaped from his suit 's cooling system and @entity24 spent months investigating the mishap , before clearing the way for more spacewalks			1
on wednesday , the amount of water seepage in @entity75 ' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when @entity15 was already inside			0
' they 're very different occurrences , ' said @entity101 , a spacewalk officer in @entity38			0
cable : @entity9 astronauts @entity15 and @entity8 had 400 more feet of power and data cable , as well as two antennas which they installed sunday astronaut : @entity15 is seen during the third spacewalk outside the @entity3 sunday during the six hour , 45 minute outing , they plan to set up antennas and communications equipment @entity24 : astronaut @entity15 , left , and @entity8 began the spacewalk at 6:52 am ( 1152 gmt ) when completed the work will allow future crews launching from @entity118 on @entity9 commercial spacecraft to be able to park at the space station the advance work , involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by @entity24			1
the work done by @entity9 astronauts @entity75 and @entity8 meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed , as well as two antennas installed on sunday			1
a pair of docking ports will fly up later this year , followed by the capsules themselves , with astronauts aboard , in 2017			2
the astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions , on february 21 and last wednesday			2
they carried out complicated work sunday , yet the astronauts completed their task an hour early making it a five and a half - hour spacewalk			2
they spent 20 hours altogether on three outings			0
neither @entity75 nor @entity8 experienced any more suit trouble during their task			0
@entity38 joked by radio : ' you guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots			0
' the 260 - mile ( 418 - kilometre ) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world 's first spacewalk by @entity152 cosmonaut @entity151 on march 18 , 1965			0
@entity24 has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented			1
work : in this image from @entity24 television astronaut @entity15 exits the quest airlock hatch beginning the third spacewalk outside the @entity3 early sunday morning march 1 , 2015 even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in june			1
@entity8 is due to return to @entity163 next week following a five and a half - month mission			0
@entity75 is midway through his expedition			0
a @entity167 soyuz spacecraft carried them both up , with @entity24 paying for the multimillion dollar tickets			2
to save money and stop being so reliant on the @entity170 , @entity24 has hired @entity171 and @entity172 to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station			2
the two contracts are worth nearly $ 7 billion			0
@entity172 already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with @entity24 .			0

engineers analyzed a water leak in one of the astronauts ' helmets '
they also had to fix a pressure sensor that malfunctioned in second suit
@entity24 said the astronauts were never in danger from the issues
they installed nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks
work was needed to build new crew capsules commissioned by @entity24
