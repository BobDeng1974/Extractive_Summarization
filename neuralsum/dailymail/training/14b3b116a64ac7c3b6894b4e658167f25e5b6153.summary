@entity0 may be the best player in the @entity1 ‘ by a mile ’ , according to one full - back tasked with shackling the 23 - year - old — but @entity4 would not swap @entity5 for even the most gifted of @entity7 ’s golden generation			1
@entity9 ’s @entity8 will face hazard in an important game on the path to @entity14 qualification at the @entity15 on sunday night , aware the @entity16 forward can go past defenders ‘ like a ghost ’			1
@entity7 forward @entity0 attempts an acrobatic volley during training on saturday but @entity8 says hazard can not compare to @entity5 , who thrives under the @entity22 spotlight after dealing with the pressure at @entity24			1
‘ @entity0 has developed under @entity25 , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ he ’s the best player in the @entity1 by a mile , i ’d say			1
@entity25 has done that — he ’s on a player if they do n’t perform			1
hazard is doing it week in , week out			0
he ’s a ball carrier , he can take @entity16 from the edge of their box to the opposition area and go past you like a ghost			0
he can go outside or inside , shoot , or make you foul him			0
‘ he ’s a great player			1
but we have one of our own			0
of course , i ’d always have @entity5 in my team before @entity0			1
i played against him when he was at @entity44 , but played with him throughout the @entity22 age groups			0
he is one of those freaks of nature who come along every now and then , technically and athletically			0
he ’s world class like the @entity50 and @entity51			0
they were born to play football			0
hazard will line up for @entity7 against @entity4 in @entity14 qualifier on sunday night ‘ the pressure is on him at @entity24 just to train properly , let alone win every game			1
he ’s matured , and physically grown into a proper man			0
it seems as if he ’s learning off @entity59 and others at @entity24 , how they work day to day			0
i ’m sure @entity61 and other nations wish he was their player			1
but he ’s so proud to be @entity22 and he wants to be a part of this squad			0
he has grown in confidence in the last year			0
he knows the onus is on him now and that he ’s our biggest player			1
’ @entity5 did not score in the last two qualifiers against @entity70 and @entity71 , which yielded four points to send @entity4 top of @entity74 , but he performed superbly in the absence of @entity76 and @entity77			1
and it is not just his @entity22 team - mates who value @entity5 — so too do his former colleagues at @entity44 , who @entity5 left behind when he joined @entity24 for a world - record £ 86 million fee			0
@entity84 , who should appear alongside hazard for @entity7 , is having a fine season for @entity44 and has scored six @entity1 goals but his club have struggled and lie 12th in the table			1
@entity1 stars @entity90 , @entity0 and @entity92 training on saturday ‘ i feel like the ghost of @entity5 is still present at @entity44 , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s not strange when you look at how much he meant to the club and the fans			2
it ’s not easy to replace him			0
’ @entity7 ’s @entity99 , another of @entity5 ’s former club mates , will not be man - marking the @entity24 star			2
‘ it ’s very difficult to mark him , ’ he said			1
‘ you mark him as a team			2
@entity106 is the most important thing for him so communication is important between our defenders and central midfield			2
he ’s an unbelievable player			2
’ @entity5 is under no illusions of the task but he remains confident			2
he said : ‘ they ’re fourth in the world so they ’re a very good side			2
we know what qualities they have , but we also know what weaknesses they have			0
we ’ll be giving it our best go and hopefully we ’ll get the three points			0
’ @entity5 thrives under the @entity22 spotlight after dealing with the pressure at @entity24			2
