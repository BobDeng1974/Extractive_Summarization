but when this large black bear strolled into the bar of an @entity2 hotel on monday night , it had n't counted upon coming face to face with ...			1
as the vast creature strolled into the @entity14 in @entity15 , bar worker @entity12 screamed at it : ' no , bear , get out			1
no , you ca n't be in here '			0
the hotel and bar manager @entity34 said he watched the omnivorous animal walk down the sidewalk and past the historic hotel 's lobby			0
he said : ' and as soon as he got to the bar door , it made a left and walked in like he wanted to have a beer			0
' but ms @entity12 was having none of it , and screeched very effectively at the bear			0
the hotel has now put video footage of the incident on its @entity51 page under the caption : ' @entity12 yelled at him and he listened ! yes , we have tough bartenders ! after the incident in the @entity2 state capital , a bear expert said it was lucky the animal did as it was told			2
