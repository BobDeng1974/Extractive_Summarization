by @entity0 they have a reputation for creating tear - jerking adverts that tug on the heart strings with a moving story played out to a soulful song			2
and this year 's @entity8 advert does n't disappoint			1
the £ 7m campaign uses a split screen to tell the love story of two young people divided by decades			1
unknown actors @entity13 and @entity15 play the part of the love struck couple , with @entity19 embarking on a relationship in the 1920s and @entity15 in the present day			2
the pair never physically meet but their stories run side - by - side as they visit the same romantic haunts and go about their daily lives			0
in another segment , flapper girl @entity19 does the @entity67 at a dance hall while @entity15 is seen on the same dance floor which is now a jumping night club			0
another scene emphasises how technology has moved on with @entity19 working at a telephone exchange and using pen and paper to write , while @entity15 has a flat screen tv in his home and uses a tablet device to send messages			2
saturday night at the movies : the couple , played by @entity13 and @entity15 , are seen outside the same cinema times have changed : in the modern day , the audience watch the film with @entity64 glasses touching : their hands come tantalisingly close - even though they are separated by nearly ninety years the story plays out as if the pair have had a argument and then realise the error of their ways			1
they send an apology before running to the same location to be reunited and walk into the same building side - by - side as a message appears on the screen - ' what 's important does n't change ' - followed by @entity8 ' slogan ' never knowing undersold since 1925			2
' the company said they hope the advert proves that ' while many aspects of our lives today are different to how they were almost 100 years ago , the really important things have n't changed at all ' , since @entity8 started trading in 1925			0
pedal power : they then go for a bike ride in the £ 7m campaign that was shot in @entity114 brushstrokes : at a gallery , @entity19 views a watercolour painting while @entity15 looks at a contemporary piece flapper girl : @entity19 does the @entity67 at a dance hall while @entity15 is at a jumping night club @entity122 advances : a telephone exchange is used in the twenties while in the modern day , messages are sent via a tablet device @entity128 , a marketing manager at @entity8 , said the advert , shot in @entity114 under the direction of @entity131 , has ' got to be one of the biggest shoots we 've ever worked on			1
' she added : ' the fact we have this split screen with half in the 1920s and half in the modern day has provided twice the challenge for us			1
' @entity8 ' director of marketing , @entity143 , added : ' when i saw the script , i thought it was a beautiful , enduring love story but told in a really innovative way			1
' as in their previous advertising campaigns , the soundtrack is a key element in telling the story			0
trouble in paradise : the couple appear to have an argument ... ... with @entity15 looking hurt and confused as his true love storms off please forgive me : they then realise the error of their ways with @entity19 writing an apology with pen and paper and @entity15 sending a message via his tablet for this year 's campaign , @entity168 singer - songwriter @entity55 is the vocalist with a soulful cover of @entity56 's @entity171 '			1
the single will be released this week and @entity55 will be hoping the @entity8 effect will have the magic touch on sales that previous artists on their campaigns have enjoyed			2
according to the @entity178 , @entity8 have been directly responsible for the sale of 1.04 million singles that have been used in its adverts since 2009			0
this includes @entity185 's cover of @entity187 's ' @entity186 ' which shot to number one after it featured in their 2010 @entity190 advert			1
she went on to perform the song at the wedding reception of the @entity194 and @entity195 as the couple had their first dance as man and wife			0
reconciliation : the couple run to the same spot ' what 's important does n't change ' : the advert aims to show that while times have moved on , human relationships are still the same appealing to early @entity190 shoppers : ' never knowing undersold ' is the slogan of the campaign , which will be followed in seven weeks by @entity8 ' 2012 festive campaign also in 2010 , @entity211 climbed into the top ten with his cover of @entity215 ’s classic ' always a woman to me ' after it was used in the @entity220 brand 's touching advert which showed a woman on the path of life from childhood to becoming a wife , mother and grandmother			1
but with their 2012 autumn advert , @entity8 had the hard act of following their 2011 @entity190 advert that could reduce people to tears by just thinking about it			0
the advert featured a little boy desperately waiting for @entity190 because he was so excited about giving a gift to his parents			0
the advert featured a moving cover of @entity242 ' please , please , please let me get what i want ' , by the then unknown @entity245 , @entity246			2
her version reached number 31 while @entity242 also re-entered the charts as people rushed to download the original			0
she 's got soul : a cover by @entity168 singer @entity55 features in the new ad but @entity8 need n't have worried about their latest advert failing to live up to expectations as it has been heaped with praise on @entity260 after it debuted on television this week			1
june @entity262 tweeted ' another tour de force ! love it ' , while @entity265 said , ' absolutely love the new @entity8 advert			2
' what 's important does n't change			0
' makes me feel all warm inside			0
' ' no teenage icon ' ‏ @ @entity271 added : ' i want to hug the creators of every @entity8 advert			0
' although @entity8 will be hoping their current advert will pull in early @entity190 shoppers , the parallel lives love story is not their festive advert for 2012			1
this has already been filmed in @entity280 and will air in seven week 's time - so get the hankies ready			0
delightful : last christmas little @entity283 brought a tear to everyone 's eye as the little boy desperately waiting for christmas day ... counting down the days : the ad featured a cover of @entity242 ' please , please , let me get what i want ' touching : the twist at the end was that @entity8 was waiting to give his parents a gift journey of life : the 2010 advert began with a little girl celebrating her birthday milestones : viewers watched her grow up to marry ... ... and become a mother , then grandmother to the soundtrack of ' always a woman to me ' , a cover of @entity215 's hit by @entity211 number one hit : @entity185 performed a gig at the department store 's @entity313 branch after her cover of @entity187 's @entity186 featured in their 2010 @entity190 ad			1
