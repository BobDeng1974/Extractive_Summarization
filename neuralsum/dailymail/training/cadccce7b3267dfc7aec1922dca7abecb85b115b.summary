there was a time when @entity2 would not have been such outlandish underdogs against @entity4			1
in fact , it was n't so long ago that the @entity7 inflicted one of the most humiliating defeats in @entity4 ’s history			1
on saturday , they meet again in the @entity12 with @entity4 the overwhelming favourites to progress			1
on loan @entity2 striker @entity14 will be hoping start against @entity4 in the @entity12 on the final day of the @entity18 campaign city were thumped 8 - 1 at @entity2 but just eight years ago they were unrecognisable from the club we know today			1
it was on the final day of the 2007/08 campaign that @entity25 ’s side were thumped 8 - 1 at the @entity26			1
the former @entity28 boss wore a haunted look as his team capitulated , suffering their biggest loss in more than 100 years			0
it had been reported @entity33 already knew of his fate and that owner @entity35 had long since decided the @entity36 was not the man for the job			0
the 8 - 1 defeat was @entity25 ’s last game in charge of @entity4 as he was sacked three weeks later @entity2 : @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 75 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 62 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 62 ) , @entity55			1
goals : @entity52 16 pen , @entity55 37 , @entity52 58 , @entity55 60 , @entity51 70 , @entity49 80 , @entity54 85 , @entity55 90			0
@entity4 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 71 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 62 ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 13 )			2
and so it proved his last game in charge			0
in fact , he has n’t managed in the @entity77 since			2
bizarrely , the performance of @entity4 ’s players at @entity2 was said to be a show of support for @entity25 , a protest at the treatment of their boss			1
a deliberate act of unprofessionalism or otherwise , their cause was hardly aided when @entity90 was sent off following a reckless challenge on @entity53 inside the penalty area after just 15 minutes			0
perhaps the sight of their skipper getting his marching orders for such a needless lunge persuaded the rest of the visiting team to throw in the towel also – either way , @entity2 certainly took advantage			2
@entity52 scored from the resulting spot - kick before @entity55 – the misfiring @entity105 striker – made it two before the break			2
@entity90 ( right ) was sent off after a reckless first half challenge on @entity53 inside the penalty area @entity52 ( left ) tucked home the resulting spot kick to give @entity2 a 1 - 0 lead on 16 minutes @entity49 scored the @entity114 sixth goal of the match with a free - kick and then the floodgates opened			1
@entity52 netted the goal of the game with a with a stunning left - foot volley , before @entity55 sprinted clear for a fourth			2
@entity121 star @entity51 came off the bench and got in on the act – albeit via a deflection off @entity62 – and @entity105 @entity49 smashed a sixth courtesy of a powerful free - kick into the top corner			2
@entity54 was another substitute desperate to seize upon @entity4 ’s weakness and he got the seventh with a cool finish before @entity55 completed his hat - trick			1
with the score at 7 - 0 , @entity66 had nicked a goal which barely merits the term ‘ consolation ’			2
for @entity25 , there were no positives			0
the scoreline is one of the largest in @entity77 history and one of @entity4 's largest - ever defeats ‘ it is difficult to take whenever you lose			1
but , when you lose like this , it is awful , ’ he said			0
‘ to concede a penalty and have @entity90 sent off was a bad start but we were in the game until it was 3 - 0			0
‘ after that , mentally we had nothing left			0
we were not even on the pitch - the team had totally gone and it was embarrassing for everyone			0
’ remarkably , @entity25 stayed in his job for another three weeks before the axe fell			0
supporters protested and handed in a 14,000 - strong petition to the club			0
city have certainly come a long way in the seven seasons since			0
world class midfielder @entity167 ( right ) has won two @entity77 titles with now - @entity170 giants @entity4 @entity4 ( 2008 ) : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 71 ) , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 62 ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 13 )			1
@entity4 ( 2015 potential line - up ) : @entity172 ; @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 ; @entity177 , @entity178 ; @entity179 , @entity167 , @entity180 ; @entity181 .			1
