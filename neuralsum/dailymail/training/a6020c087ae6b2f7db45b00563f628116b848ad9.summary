a world map redrawn according to each country 's population has reduced the land down under to a tiny speck			1
the new cartogram , created by @entity6 , visibly compares @entity8 's population of 23.7 million to countries with significantly larger numbers like @entity11 and @entity12			1
such countries virtually dominate the map while nations with a population of about one million or under are barely visible , while some are too small to even make it on the map			1
@entity11 's land mass on the map has increased thanks to its population of 1.4 billion and same goes for @entity12 which has 1.3 billion			0
other nations like @entity37 with 859,000 , @entity38 with 328,000 , @entity39 with 631,000 , and @entity40 with 416,000 , have been scaled down to a micro square			2
countries with less than 250,000 - such as @entity42 which has a population of 56,000 - were too small to appear on the cartogram			0
the map is an updated version of the first one released by the same creator 10 years ago			0
since then , it shows that @entity12 has grown by almost 200 million people while @entity11 has increased by about 60 million			0
@entity8 's population , according to the map , has risen by more than three million since 2005			1
the first cartogram which was created by the same @entity56 user teadranks 10 years ago			2

a new cartogram created by @entity6 shows each country 's size scaled to its population
countries with large populations like @entity11 and @entity12 dominate the map
smaller populations which have big geographic areas like @entity8 , @entity29 and @entity30 appear small
other nations like @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 are barely visible
@entity6 compared the map to the *original* one made 10 years ago
@entity8 's population , according to the map , has risen by more than three million since 2005
