a local tv station in @entity1 accidentally showed a porn site during a news segment about a new app. @entity5 was doing a report on an app that helps juveniles expunge their criminal records to show the many different ways users can access the site , they filmed a production staffer looking up the app on their @entity15			1
unfortunately , the phone 's owner had recently visited a porn website and that appeared in the search history on air but while typing the address into the search bar , the @entity15 owner 's search history popped up - revealing an embarrassing query for @entity33			1
a user on @entity35 pointed the snafu out and the station quickly took down the video from their website			2
' @entity1 needs a fresh start on their browser history ... ' the user wrote			0
@entity44 was quick enough to record the video and post it on their own site , so the on - air slip - up can be preserved for years to come			0
there 's an app for that : the news broadcast was about a new app that helps juveniles in @entity55 expunge their criminal records news stations often use phones belonging to their own employees to use as props in news segments			0
it 's likely that whoever lent their phone did n't know how to clear their search history , which is easier to do on a computer than on a phone			0
for the @entity15 used in the segment , the owner could have cleared the search history by clicking ' settings ' , going into the @entity73 app and clicking ' @entity74 ' .			1

the @entity1 tv station was doing a report on a new app when they accidentally showed a *previous* search for a porn website
the porn website 's address was broadcast on tv during the segment and someone pointed out the mistake on @entity35
the snafu could have been *avoided* if the phone 's owner cleared their *internet* search history
