by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 04:44 est , 2 january 2013 with cast - iron @entity4 saucepans , a six - hob oven and a @entity8 dishwasher , @entity2 ’s kitchen would be the envy of many			1
so it may be a surprise to learn she did not pay a penny for any of those items – nor , indeed , for almost everything else in her well - equipped home			1
amazingly , she has furnished the three - bedroom semi in @entity19 , @entity20 , to an impressive standard for free by scouring websites where people give away their unwanted items			1
scroll down for a video tour of @entity2 's home @entity2 in her kitchen which includes many of the second - hand goods she has collected over the past five years inside and out : a sofa @entity31 recovered from a tip near her home in @entity19 , @entity20 as well as sofas , cushions , cutlery , clothing and linen , mother - of - three miss @entity2 , 49 , has also managed to pick up a 15ft palm tree , which would have cost £ 1,000 to buy , for the garden , and a sailboard for windsurfing			1
she also frequents charity shops on the look - out for bargains – and once found a brand - new £ 900 @entity48 sideboard in a skip			2
it has taken her five years , and everything might not match , but the end result is akin to the fashionable ‘ shabby chic ’ style which some fork out thousands to achieve			2
work bonus : miss @entity2 's old boss gave her this chair among the items @entity31 has found for free are @entity4 pans , left , and an ornamental duck , right miss @entity2 , who estimates she has saved at least £ 20,000 by her unconventional approach , said : ‘ i do n’t think there is any shame in it			1
i feel it is more shameful to be a consumer and be all hoity - toity about it than to do what i do			0
’ she is among the growing number of people in ‘ austerity @entity72 ’ to have joined @entity74 , an online community with 1.4million members nationally			2
on its website , people advertise items they want to give away , with the only condition usually that the person who wants it has to collect it			2
miss @entity2 , who has 18 - year - old twin daughters and a 21 - year - old son , said : ‘ there is a misconception that it ’ll be junk but a lot of affluent people give things away , perhaps because they are changing the colour scheme of their home or because they are moving and a piece of furniture does n’t fit in their new place			1
‘ it may be costly for them to have it taken away or put into storage , so both sides benefit			0
‘ the monetary value of the items is not important to me			2
we ’ve had things which we would never have had otherwise , but what matters to me is that it is something which i need and which still has some useful life left in it			0
‘ some people are maybe too proud to do what i do , but i ’d say to them that there are lots of different levels of second hand			0
people do n’t think twice about buying furniture from antique shops and auctions , for example			0
’ a keen environmentalist , she was formerly a personal assistant to a university academic but was made redundant 18 months ago and says her thriftiness helped her survive that			1
her skill at bargain home - furnishing also recently helped her to secure a six - month contract working as a resource co-ordinator for @entity128 on an arts project			0
miss @entity2 , who emigrated from @entity130 in 1997 , said : ‘ five years ago many people would have turned their noses up at free items			1
but people are more conscious of getting value for money since the recession hit and considering where they are spending their income			0
‘ i can maintain my home without it eating into income for food and raising three kids			0
living the way i do allows me to live comfortably but within my means			0
’ the plasma television in her sitting room was a gift from relatives , and when she does make a purchase – she bought an @entity152 , for example – she says she ‘ always goes for quality ’ and does not replace things just because an updated model comes out			0
hot property : miss @entity2 says her favourite free item is a digital radio , left , while she also managed to pick up a 15ft palm tree worth £ 1,000 for nothing			1

@entity2 , 49 , has sofas , dishwasher , cutlery , clothing and even an oven
found items on @entity74 website or left unwanted in skips near home in @entity19 , @entity20 during past five years
' i do *n't* think there 's any shame in it , ' says former personal assistant
