by @entity0 in @entity1 on wednesday @entity4 , spearheading @entity3 ’s forward line , ran out of ideas			0
this was not his night			0
at the end , after 120 desperate minutes here in @entity1 , they could n’t even turn to him from the penalty spot in the shootout			2
he had been taken off in extra-time , replaced by @entity13 at a time when @entity3 coach @entity15 desperately needed a goal			1
one chance was all @entity18 wanted , one opportunity to seal @entity3 ’s place in the @entity22 final against @entity23 on sunday			1
it felt like it would never come and it never did			0
the @entity37 defence was on to the striker him , fully focused on keeping @entity18 quiet			1
they did a decent job of it			0
@entity40 was eventually booked , cautioned for tripping @entity53 at the start of the second half			1
well , it was always going to happen			0
the @entity58 defender has a decent game in him at times and this , despite the caution , had the makings of one of them			1
@entity18 is @entity66 ’s man , the striker who can turn games with those clinical finishes from his left boot			2
rare sight : @entity3 's star man of the @entity22 @entity53 touched the ball just seven times in the first half nowhere to go : @entity53 , like @entity18 , found himself hassled and hurried when he was on the ball there were times when he perked up , but @entity29 ’s central defensive pairing kept him quiet for some long and lonely periods			1
he got going midway through the first half when @entity53 set him free down the right but he could n’t return the pass into his team - mate			1
there is a menacing air to him and he always comes alive when there is a sniff of a scoring chance			0
he just did n’t get that chance here			0
when he was replaced by @entity13 he had taken just 23 touches of the ball and failed to have a single shot on goal			1
he had got off to a brilliant start at the tournament , scoring twice - one of them a magnificent diving header - in the 5 - 1 thumping of @entity98 in the opening group game			0
here he lacked intensity , bouncing off defenders in the first half and struggling to find some friends up front in this @entity3 team			0
@entity105 , the man cast in the supporting role in the @entity108 shirt , touched the ball a dozen times in the first half ; @entity53 just seven			1
@entity18 has been desperate to make up for the heartbreak of 2010 , when he was in the @entity3 team beaten in extra-time by the brilliance of @entity98			2
not this time : @entity15 looks to @entity18 as his matchwinner but the striker could not deliver on wednesday frustration : @entity105 dominated the @entity117 but he could not shine against @entity37 in 2010 it was @entity105 ’s year , guiding @entity119 to @entity121 glory and scoring five on the way to the @entity22 final against @entity98 in @entity124			1
four years on and the main man is @entity4 , the man handed the captaincy when @entity105 was n’t sure whether he would make @entity15 ’s tournament weigh - in			0
@entity18 was part of the @entity3 team in @entity131 , a beaten finalist under @entity133 after @entity134 settled it for @entity98 in the 116th minute			2
here in @entity135 he has been a positive influence within the @entity138 camp , taking his responsibilities of leading the country at a @entity22 with dignity and a great degree of professionalism			1
on the pitch he went on to score in the penalty shootout against @entity146 , setting the tone for @entity3 ’s dramatic victory with a ruthless finish from the spot			0
pointing the way : @entity66 tried to get the most he could out of his players failing to meet expectation : @entity18 ( centre ) did not light up this match for @entity3 here , one of the grandest stages of all , more is expected of a player with his pedigree			1
this guy is a matchwinner , made for occasions like this and his subdued first half performance in @entity1 was a huge disappointment			2
he was alone for long periods , unable to muster a single shot in a fruitless first half			0
to his credit , he never gave up			0
there was always the temptation to throw on @entity13 , an obvious threat to @entity29 ’s tiring legs as this tournament enters its final few days			1
something had to change in a game that was off the pace			0
we were spoiled by @entity23 ’s extraordinary 7 - 1 victory over @entity23			2
these two were tighter , savvy in defence and unwilling to let anything get beyond @entity37 keeper @entity182 or @entity3 ’s first choice @entity183			2
in the end , they had to settle for the shootout			0
taken off : @entity18 was substituted for @entity13 during extra-time in @entity1 @entity18 's right - hand man : @entity18 ( right ) shakes the hand of coach @entity66 as he leaves the field			1

@entity18 was quiet as @entity29 's centre - back pairing of @entity40 and @entity38 dealt with the forward well
@entity58 's @entity40 played well , despite being booked
@entity53 touched the ball just seven times in first half
he has *excelled* in *earlier* matches and has been *poistive* influence in camp
but more is expected of @entity18 in such a huge match on world stage
he never gave up but was substituted for @entity13 in extra time
@entity37 won 4 - 2 on penalties after a *goalless* 120 minutes of *football*
@entity37 will face @entity23 in @entity22 final on sunday at the @entity214
