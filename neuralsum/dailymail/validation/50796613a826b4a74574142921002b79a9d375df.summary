it will be trebles all round on sunday night when two of the most expensive forward lines of all time come face to face in the @entity6 – @entity8 ’s three - pronged attack of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 up against @entity13 trio @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity17 ’s threesome have the edge so far this season having scored 56 goals between them — one more than @entity23 ’s attack			0
but with @entity9 missing the first two months of the season and @entity11 out of form before the turn of the year , there is a feeling that the @entity8 strike - force gave their @entity13 counterparts a head start and are about to go past them			1
there is also a feeling at a club that has a history of brilliant front threes that this particular @entity8 group could finish up being the best ever			0
@entity11 , @entity9 and @entity38 have netted 55 @entity40 goals between them this season @entity11 has hit top form for the @entity40 leaders after enduring a difficult start to the season it was in the 2008 - 09 season that @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity11 scored 100 goals between them in one campaign with the former @entity54 striker scoring 26 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
@entity48 was at the @entity6 on wednesday to cover @entity8 ’s victory over @entity58 for @entity59 and went down to the @entity8 dressing room after the game to congratulate the players who could yet break that scoring record this season			2
following the @entity48 / @entity66 / @entity11 forward line came the @entity11 / @entity69 / @entity68 one that also won a @entity71 against @entity72			2
they scored 98 goals in the 2010 - 11 season with @entity11 getting 53 , @entity76 23 and @entity68 21			0
@entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 have scored 56 league goals between them this season in the 2008 - 09 campaign @entity8 's front three of @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity11 scored 100 goals both attacks had a tendency to come good in the @entity84 and @entity48 played in one of the most famous @entity13 - @entity8 games in 2009 with @entity8 winning 6 - 2 at the @entity87 , @entity48 and @entity11 both scoring twice			1
on sunday it is the @entity8 three who are in the best form , although none of them could get past @entity92 on wednesday			0
@entity13 ’s ‘ @entity94 ’ forward line are a little more out of sorts with @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity12 having scored five each since the turn of the year			1
tomorrow at the home of their biggest rivals would be the perfect time and place to alter the trend once more .			0

@entity8 play @entity13 at @entity6 on wednesday in *crucial* @entity84
*showdown* is being *billed* as @entity8 's front three vs @entity13 's attacking trio
@entity11 , @entity9 and @entity10 have scored 55 goals between them
@entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 have one more
@entity8 attacking trio could become the club 's best ever forward line
