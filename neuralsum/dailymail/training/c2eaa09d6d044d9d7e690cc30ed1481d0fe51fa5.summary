two games , two managers , two defeats , two goals conceded to @entity4			1
the @entity5 has not been terribly kind to @entity6 in the first steps of this season			1
it ’s been a strange old week for the @entity10 , who seem to have lost a little of their yap , not to mention @entity15			2
@entity16 , the club ’s caretaker for a third time in three years , probably put it best when he said ‘ losing a manager after one game is a new one for me ’			1
match winner : @entity4 scored twice for @entity24 's side against @entity6 @entity25 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 ( @entity32 55 ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ( @entity36 81 ) ; @entity4 ( @entity37 68 ) , @entity38 subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 @entity6 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 ; @entity50 ( @entity51 61 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 61 ) , @entity54 ; @entity55 ( @entity56 76 ) , @entity57 subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 booked : @entity50 , @entity46 , @entity47 @entity63 : @entity4 referee : @entity65 attendance : 20,749 the circumstances of @entity15 ’ departure are still not terribly clear , except that it followed a 4 - 0 opening - day defeat against @entity71 , during which he was loudly jeered by his own fans and felt the players had ‘ gone ’			1
the club initially said it was in the ‘ interests of all parties ’ ; the chairman , @entity78 , later revealed @entity15 had , in fact , walked			0
the shame for @entity16 is that his squad seemed to be walking as well for the first 45 minutes of this fixture			1
by the time they found their stride they were already two down against a club that would view another championship season as a failure			0
they got better and , more impressively , continued to fight for @entity16 after going 3 - 1 down			1
but praise is not the same as points , and endeavour is not necessarily a match for a striker like @entity4 , who is not yet fully fit and has already scored three goals this season			1
his scruffy first came on 35 minutes , six after @entity34 ’s 30 - yard strike put @entity25 in front			1
@entity46 pulled one back in first - half stoppage time before @entity4 wrapped it up with a powerful drive 10 minutes after the restart			2
‘ @entity4 has worked hard this summer , ’ said @entity25 manager @entity24 , who subbed off the @entity106 after 68 minutes			1
‘ he is still not fit enough to play 90 minutes - we are working on him			0
’ it seems to be working			0
@entity4 was a disappointment after joining last january , scoring only once as they went down			2
he remains infuriatingly inconsistent , missing the ball completely when a great chance came his way in the first half			0
but his power and finishing have been proven over time in the @entity117 and , on current evidence , he will thrive at the lower level			0
celebration : @entity4 jumps in the air after scoring @entity25 's third goal at the @entity123 ‘ he came to us in january having played not much football , ’ @entity24 said			1
‘ he played a couple of games on adrenaline and the fitness caught up with him			0
it is an important season for him			0
’ the same can be said of @entity24			0
for @entity6 , the ambitions are lower but no less intense			2
‘ it ’s our third season in the championship and we want to stay there , ’ said @entity16			2
things will have to improve under their third manager of the season .			0

@entity6 are bottom of the @entity5 after two big defeats
@entity25 's @entity4 netted twice while @entity34 also scored
*academy* coach @entity16 is in *temporary* charge of @entity6
