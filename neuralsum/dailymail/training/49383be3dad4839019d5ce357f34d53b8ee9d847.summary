by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 27 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:57 est , 27 november 2013 a mystery investor has bought a disused @entity5 tube station from the @entity6 for £ 50million			1
@entity11 station , on the old @entity8 line near @entity9 , opened in 1906 but closed in 1934 due to lack of passengers			1
during the @entity14 the tube station housed @entity16 's anti-aircraft operations hq and @entity18 's right - hand man @entity17 was reportedly interrogated there			1
the disused @entity20 contains a drill hall , garages , offices and mess as well as underground rooms , staircases and tunnels landmark : the building features the oxblood - red tiled facade and semi-circular windows typical of architect @entity33 's style the @entity6 bought the station in 1938 for £ 22,000 to use as a training facility but have now sold it as part of cost - cutting measures			1
it was snapped up by a mystery @entity40 billionaire for the eye - watering sum of £ 50million after a fierce bidding war			0
the new owner outbid members of the @entity48 @entity47 to snap up the 28,000sq ft real estate - and announced plans to turn the building into a series of luxury apartments			1
but not everybody is happy that the old station is to be turned into new flats			0
ghost station : the historic 28,000 sq ft building was sold off by the @entity6 as part of a cost cutting exercise spooky : the passages where commuters would have made their way to platforms in the early 20th century remain today @entity33 : @entity11 was one of a number of tube stations designed by the @entity70 architect , who favoured the @entity72 remains : switch gear used during the building 's days as an underground station still remain today @entity77 , of the @entity78 , said : ' we have lost a big piece of our heritage to foreign investors			1
' @entity83 opened in 1906 by the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) on the @entity8 , positioned between @entity85 and @entity86			0
the building was designed by @entity70 architect @entity33 and features his distinctive oxblood - red tiled facade and semi-circular first floor windows			0
new life : ' @entity92 ' are seen lined up outside the @entity33 - designed station in @entity85 as it looks today historic links : the former underground station and @entity14 command centre could be transformed into flats distinctive : the green interior tiles remain inside the @entity33 - designed station today eerie : a bricked off tunnel deep beneath the ground at the old @entity104 station varied past : the building is currently occupied by the @entity106 , the @entity107 , and @entity108 danger : @entity11 ceased to be used as a tube station in 1934 on the market : the @entity6 is hoping the former tube station will fetch an eight figure sum when it is marketed by agents @entity115 in september safety measures : a metal fire escape at the old underground station on @entity5 's @entity11 @entity5 's hidden network : warning notices hang inside @entity11 station in central @entity5 warnings : everything at track and platform level at @entity11 remains in the ownership of @entity127 , which has no involvement in the sale of the building war years : the @entity132 ran its anti-aircraft operations room from @entity11 during the @entity14 located at the junction of @entity11 and @entity136 , the station was convenient for the @entity137 and the @entity138 , but still saw little traffic			1
it was permanently closed in 1934 after it was finally deemed to be too close to the neighbouring stations to be economically viable			2
the station was taken over by the @entity143 to be used as a command centre for the defence of @entity5			0
it was from here that the gun batteries dotted around @entity5 were coordinated as they tried to shoot down enemy planes during @entity14			2
there are understood to be 32 ghost stations across @entity5 's underground network , abandoned over the years as lines were diverted or the number of passengers passing through dwindled			2
like @entity11 , many of the stations have links to the @entity14			1
down street - last used as a station in may 1932 , became an air raid shelter after the war broke out , and @entity162 was used by thousands of @entity163 during the @entity164			2
the empty station in @entity166 has been used as a location for films including @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and 28 weeks later			0
other abandoned stations still remain at @entity173 , which was on the @entity174 until it closed its doors in 1922 , @entity176 , which was on the @entity177 , and @entity178 , which closed in 1924			0
@entity179 closed in 1932 because it was under - used , while @entity180 is unique in that it is a closed tube station that never actually opened			1
intended to be the deepest station on the underground network , work on @entity180 stopped in 1906 because it was not deemed financially viable			0
@entity16 is believed to have visited the command centre to watch over the command of the battle against the @entity189			2
it was vacated by the @entity143 in the 1950s but seventy years on the @entity6 still owns it to a depth of about 60ft underground			0
the @entity6 's jurisdiction ends at a locked gate and beyond this tube trains still run on the @entity8			2
but evidence of the @entity132 's operations centre remains in remarkable condition			2
maps of @entity5 still hang from the walls of the war room			0
the station retains period features including a distinctive brown and green tiling pattern and electrical switch gear			0
@entity11 is n't the only ' ghost station ' in @entity5			1
@entity162 , initially called @entity209 , is one of the most famous			0
it opened in 1907 but its financial viability was perennially in doubt and , after running a peak hours service only for many years , the station closed for good in 1994			1
@entity214 , near @entity215 , which closed in 1932 , was used as an air raid shelter by @entity16			1
a bath installed in 1939 has been dubbed “ @entity218 ”			0
the @entity219 once had its own tube station on the @entity221			1
it opened in 1900 but has not been used by the general public since 1933			0
holborn station is a few hundred yards away			0
not viable : the station was conveniently located for @entity138 ( pictured ) , but did not see a lot of traffic through its doors attractions : @entity11 was also close to the @entity137 ( pictured ) , and @entity9 , but was closed permanently as a station in 1934 because it was too close to @entity230 stops war effort : developers keen to capitalise on the station 's links to @entity16 have previously expressed an interest in transforming it into a tourist attraction footage courtesy of the @entity78			1
