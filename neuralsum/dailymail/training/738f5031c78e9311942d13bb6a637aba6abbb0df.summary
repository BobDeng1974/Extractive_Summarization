but it 's unlikely many of the competitors at this eccentric athletic competition will be troubling the @entity8 squad or @entity9 at @entity10			0

decked out in their finest pinstripe suits and bowler hats , gentlemen took part in the events which were competitive , but at all time well - mannered			0

bread basketball saw diners trying their best to catch bread as their food was used for a game of ' @entity70 ' between waiters			0
manners : a competitor takes part in ' @entity70 ' - where a table of dinners attempt to catch food as waiters play basketball with their bread taking a break : a chap takes a rest from the rambunctious entertainment to sip a glass of red wine ladies are also welcome to attend the @entity11 and many wear showing off their best vintage styles steady on : the @entity90 saw competitors take a cup of tea from one rider to the next vintage : a chapette enjoys a puff on her pipe during the event which was held in glorious weather careful : riders in the @entity90 struggle to pass a full cup from one to the next a new event , @entity90 , tasked competitors with riding around a course carrying a cup of tea from one rider to the next			2

a roaring time : a lady smokes using a 1920s style cigarette holder reward : gold , silver and bronze cravats were handed out to winning competitors the event is the brainchild of @entity134 - a publication dedicated to a dandyish way of life a jolly good laugh : the vintage festival takes place surrounded by the @entity142 architecture of @entity12 handbags at dawn : two competitors engage at close quarters with brollys and briefcases spiffing good show : although the events were competitive , good manners are observed at all times			1
