overcoming terminal cancer through healthy eating - that statement in print appears dubious at best			1
but it becomes completely believable when it is brought to life through the inspirational , optimistic , comeback story of a charismatic , beautiful , young woman named @entity7			1
@entity7 cast a spell through her endearing vulnerability and charming personality , collecting an enormous social media following who were enamoured with her brave account of reclaiming her health			2
wellness warrior @entity7 has admitted that she never had cancer and does not want forgiveness now that @entity7 has admitted she made her story up , we ask ourselves , how could we have fallen so hard for an account of what many have called a medical miracle , without a shred of supporting evidence ? the answer is very simple			1
and we did not so much believe in @entity25 ´ s story , as we believed in @entity25			1
everyone loves a heart - warming account of overcoming the odds			0
we were enchanted by @entity25 s journey , as well as by @entity7 herself			1
a beautiful , young , inspirational woman , we fell in love with her story as well as with her — which caused us even to downplay the rumours and suspicions of sceptics within the medical community as the fabric of her brave fight against cancer began to unravel			1
here are five ways that the @entity7 ´ s of the world win us over			2
she founded the @entity45 - a book and app which over 300,000 people have downloaded appearances are reality — and @entity51 believe it or not , studies show that people can not distinguish between behaviour that is honest and behaviour that is deceptive			1
this causes us to make the easier judgement — that other people are truthful			2
to make matters worse , when we like someone , we are likely to believe they are truthful , even when they are lying			0
how do we overcome the truthfulness bias ? one way is to closely examine a person ´ s motives			0
when someone relays a heart - warming story , as @entity7 did , what is she getting out of it ? while many people do not want to spoil a happy ending with a cloud of suspicion , examining prospective outcomes for the storyteller often raises suspicions about potential ulterior motives that might otherwise never come to light			1
@entity80 says we fell for @entity7 because ' we love heartwarming stories — especially comeback stories ' born to @entity84 - there is a bit of @entity7 in @entity86 we love heart - warming stories — especially comeback stories			1
especially when we feel an affinity to the heroine			0
we were @entity25 s cheerleaders as she recounted her fight against cancer — using a weapon we all have at our disposal : healthy eating			1
every one of us could be @entity7 in the future , because cancer strikes without warning			2
we loved walking along side her in her journey , recognizing there is a bit of @entity7 in all of us			2
we identified with her vulnerability , celebrated her success in regaining her health , and felt empowered by the recognition that although we each face different hurdles , if she could beat the odds , so can we			2
' we loved walking along side her in her journey , recognizing there is a bit of @entity7 in all of us ' credibility clouds perception : failing to @entity115 ´ s alarm bells credible people are welcome sources of security			1
we feel comfortable following their lead , and taking their advice			0
@entity7 released a whole foods recipe book and top - rating food app , which thousands of people bought			1
why ? because she was a certified nutritionist ? because the medical community validated her recipes ? nope			0
simply because we liked her , and therefore viewed her as credible			0
when we view someone as credible , we rely on their guidance and believe what they say			0
unfortunately , this blind trust can create emotional blinders that cause us to miss , misinterpret , or discount red flags			0
credibility is not a speaker trait , but a perception created in an audience			0
credible , likeable , well - spoken communicators are believed to possess a wide range of positive traits including reliability , trustworthiness , goodwill , and expertise			0
believe it or not , we also view such people as an authority , even when we do not have any personal knowledge of their credentials			2
@entity151 is the author of @entity152 : how to spot frenemies , @entity154 , and toxic people the @entity156 — the @entity157 @entity7 is an attractive young woman with an endearing personality			1
we can ´ t help but smile as we watch the video footage documenting her journey , including her hopes , dreams , and bright plans for the future			0
@entity25 s emotional appeal stems from the halo effect — where we tend to clothe attractive , likeable people with a host of other positive characteristics that they do not have			2
these characteristics include trustworthiness and honesty			0
' once we form a positive impression of another person , good luck trying to change our mind ' trading @entity178 for @entity179 once we form a positive impression of another person , good luck trying to change our mind			0
we are incredibly resistant to negative information that threatens an emotionally pleasing positive impression we have of someone we have grown to like , respect , or admire			0
so many people fell in love with @entity7 ´ s approachable , endearing , likeable persona , they were fanatical in their support of her straightforward , simple , healthy strategy of battling one of the world ´ s deadliest conditions			1
the lesson here ? the next time you hear a seemingly unbelievable story narrated by an attractive , emotional pleasing storyteller , trade in your rose colored classes for reading glasses , to ensure that you can and should believe what you see			0
