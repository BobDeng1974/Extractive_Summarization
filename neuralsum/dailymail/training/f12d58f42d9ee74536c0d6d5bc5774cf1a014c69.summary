by @entity0 @entity1 are playing far below their best , are over-reliant on @entity2 and must improve if they are to beat @entity3 in their @entity5 quarter - finals , according to @entity6			1
' we still have n't got started , ' @entity6 , who won the 1986 @entity5 with @entity1 , said in a withering analysis of the team 's performances so far at the tournament in @entity12			1
' they need to get it into their heads that we ca n't be " @entity17 '			2
maybe he can score a great goal ... but if it does n't come off for the kid , we ca n't jump on him tomorrow as if he 's guilty of the @entity22 disaster			0
his comments were widely reported in @entity40 media on thursday			0
he said @entity1 's big name team were playing at only 40 percent of their capacity and criticized them for only squeaking past @entity37 1 - 0 with a last - gasp goal in extra time			1
' man - for - man , and collectively , @entity1 are better			1
they ( the @entity48 ) may make good watches but they have few footballers , ' the always controversial @entity6 said			1
@entity1 , who were to train behind closed doors on thursday at their camp in @entity54 before flying to @entity55 for saturday 's game versus @entity3 , won all three group games before beating the @entity48 in the last 16			2
@entity2 has won man - of - the - match in each game , and scored four of @entity1 's seven goals			2
but the wins have all been by one - goal margins and have masked some subdued individual performances by other players expected to make bigger contributions			0
adds insult to injury : @entity6 also claims @entity37 are better at making watches than playing football ' the kid ( @entity2 ) is very alone ... the team does n't have a change of rhythm , movements in its strikers , ' added @entity6 , saying the players lacked a give - it - all attitude			1
' i feel something very strong inside , like bitterness , rage , frustration , because @entity1 can play much , much better ... the coach has to impose this			0
" if they do not improve against @entity3 , " we 're in trouble , ' he said			0
@entity1 have won the @entity5 twice and would dearly love to lift it for a third time on the soil of their great rivals @entity12			0
tens of thousands of blue - and - white - clad @entity22 have flooded across the border to cheer them on			0
