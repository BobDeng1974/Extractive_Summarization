it 's widely accepted that not knowing your biological parents can be psychologically damaging			0
there have been documented cases of how not knowing who your biological parents can damage your sense of identity and heritage			0
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , was conceived using an anonymous sperm donation in the 1970s			1
now mr @entity10 is hoping to remove some of those psychologically harmful feelings he has felt since discovering he was conceived by a sperm donation			1
but rather than tracking down his biological father , something which he is legally forbidden from doing , mr @entity10 hopes to address a less acknowledged hurdle			1
@entity10 , pictured ( middle ) with his mother and social father			2
the current practice for the birth certificate of donor conceived children is for the receiving couple to be listed as parents on the birth certificate mr @entity10 believes his birth certificate is inaccurate and that it is having a dehumanising effect on his life ‘ the current legal practice for donor conceived children is for the receiving couple , or commissioning couple , to be listed as parents on the birth certificate , ’ mr @entity10 told @entity32			1
‘ this means my birth certificate is technically inaccurate			1
it creates a sense of deception in my life			0
’ if he is successful , mr @entity10 will be the first @entity44 to have his birth certificate amended so his his father is listed an ' unknown '			1
' i 'm doing this because i want a factual record of my birth			0
i 'm a firm believer in truth , it 's how i was raised			0
i 'm sure my ( adopted ) father would support me in this decision			2
i do n't need a piece of paper to tell me how much i loved my father , or how much he loved me			0
' mr @entity10 explained that donor - conceived children suffer from a lack of identity			1
' we are are already denied access to their heritage and associated kinship			0
we are denied our medical history			0
many animals have have a more accurate birth record than i do and i find that completely dehumanising			2
' mr @entity10 said that his profession was instrumental in the pursuit			1
' i work as a medical researcher			1
it means i am exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception , which played a role in my decision to pursue this			2
' mr @entity10 said that his profession of medical researcher has exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception , in turn influencing his current pursuit mr @entity10 says he has received support from groups like donor conception @entity12 , as well as the full support of my friends and family mr @entity10 filed his his application with the @entity94 in @entity11 two weeks ago , but he says that this is something he had resolved to do several years ago			1
' i have wanted to do this for a long time , but my family and professional life ended up prolonging the process			0
' if mr @entity10 is successful , he only be second person in the world to have corrected their birth certificate in this way			1
in july this year , 26 - year - old donor - conceived @entity106 woman @entity105 became the first person to have achieved the feat , albeit after a six year legal battle			2
mr @entity10 said he was n't initially influenced by mrs @entity112 plight , but that it was vastly assuring			1
' i had decided to do this before i heard about her , but it was very assuring to know that someone had achieved this			0
somebody had to take the plunge			0
it was also opportune timing			0
if i do get to take this to a @entity94 courtroom , i will certainly be able to use her case to my advantage			2
the legal system in @entity106 is largely similar to that in @entity12			2
' mr @entity10 believes there is no certainty in the outcome of his case to amend his birth certificate , however he believes the case of @entity136 , the only person to have successfully achieved the same pursuit , will assist in his case however in another sense it proved how difficult the process will be			1
' the fact that it took six years , and that it has only ever happened once before - it means i have no certainty of a successful outcome			0
' mr @entity10 says he has received a torrent of support for his cause			1
' i 've been approached by individuals , as well as support groups like donor conception @entity12			2
there are people in a likewise position who hope to pursue the same path now			0
i also have the unbridled support of my friends and family , which i 'm very grateful for			0
