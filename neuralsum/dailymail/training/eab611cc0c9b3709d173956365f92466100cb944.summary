the @entity1 - controlled @entity0 has passed a one - week funding extension for @entity3 after the majority refused to pass the legislation just hours before the deadline			1
lawmakers were thrown into a race against time on friday night when 52 @entity1 defected on the leadership - backed legislation			1
the vote was 224 - 203 against the measure			1
two hours before the midnight deadline , the @entity0 voted 357 to 60 to fund the department for another week			1
a combination of conservative , tea party - backed republicans on one side of the political aisle and @entity19 on the other opposed the bill			1
the first group was upset because the legislation had been stripped of changes to president @entity26 's immigration policy , and the second because it lacked full - year funding for the sprawling department			1
democrats led by rep. @entity38 of @entity39 urged them in advance to allow a vote on a bill to keep the department in funds through the sept. 30 end of the budget year - a step the @entity1 high command had previously refused to take			1
' you have made a mess , ' @entity38 said to @entity1 as debate neared an end on the measure			0
that was n't how tea party - backed rebels saw it			2
' it does not make any difference whether the funding is for three weeks , three months or a full fiscal year			2
if it 's illegal , it 's illegal , ' said rep. @entity65 , @entity66 other conservatives disagreed with that sort of analysis in large numbers - and said so			2
' it 's the best solution that we have available to us right now , ' said rep. @entity73 , @entity75 ' nobody wants to shut down the @entity3			0
' across the @entity77 , the @entity76 waited to add its assent after playing out a series of acts in the @entity1 ' effort to use the measure to wring concessions on immigration from the @entity0			2
a largely symbolic attempt to advance legislation that would repeal @entity26 's immigration directive of last fall failed on a vote of 57 - 42 , three short of the 60 required			1
that separate proposal was ' commonsense legislation that would protect our democracy from the egregious example of executive overreach we saw in november , ' said senate majority leader @entity96 of @entity97 , who successfully led his rank and file in recent days to a decision to pass @entity3 legislation without immigration - related provisions			0
much of the @entity3 was to remain open , even if funding expired at midnight			0
airport security checkpoints would remain staffed , immigration agents would be on the job , air marshals would do their work and @entity110 patrols would sail on			0
defected : @entity38 ( @entity111 ) called on speaker @entity34 to approve full - year funding of the department 's 230,000 employees , an estimated 200,000 would remain at work , either because they are deemed essential , or because their pay comes from fees that are unaffected by congressional spending disputes			1
and ironically , a federal court order has blocked implementation of @entity26 's immigration policies that most republicans seek , at least temporarily			1
taken together , the day 's events at the @entity77 underscored the difficulty @entity1 have had so far this year in translating last fall 's election gains into legislative accomplishment - a step its own leaders say is necessary to establish the party 's credentials as a responsible , governing party			2
republicans gained control of the @entity76 in last november 's balloting , and emerged with their largest @entity0 majority in more than 70 years			0
further demonstrating @entity1 woes , @entity0 @entity1 leaders abruptly called off a vote on a major education bill that had attracted significant opposition from conservatives as well as @entity19 and the @entity0			1
aides attributed that decision to the need to work separately on rounding up enough votes to pass the measure that would prevent a partial shutdown at @entity3			0
the day 's developments occurred against a midnight deadline for funding the department , an agency with significant responsibilities in the nation 's fight against terrorism			2
an early , 240 - 183 test vote in the @entity0 indicated ample support for the spending bill , but a short while later the @entity0 was gaveled into recess while the search went on for support to pass the legislation itself			2
' @entity163 must pass this bill in short order to keep the lights on at the @entity3 in the near term , ' said rep. @entity168 , @entity169			0
' hopefully , this will buy us this additional time that we clearly need			0
' @entity19 argued against the measure , saying their preference was a longer - term bill to provide funding that carries the department trough the @entity179 end of the budget year without attempting to alter immigration policy			1
it cleared the @entity76 friday on a vote of 68 - 31			0
' give us a vote , mr. speaker			0
instead , drip , drip , drip , ' said rep. @entity38 of @entity39 , the @entity190 leader			0
some @entity0 @entity1 agreed , noting that @entity19 had demonstrated their ability to block any challenges to @entity26 's immigration policies , and that the president had vowed to veto them in any event			1
' the only question is when - tomorrow or in three weeks , ' said rep. @entity197 , @entity198			0
' some folks just have a harder time facing political reality than others			0
' @entity26 's first immigration directive , in 2012 , lifted the threat of deportation from many immigrants brought to the country illegally as youngsters			1
another order last fall applied to millions more who are in the @entity212 unlawfully .			0

@entity1 - backed @entity0 rejected legislation 224 - 203 on friday
two hours before deadline , lawmakers voted 357 to 60 to approve extension
conservatives who voted against the funding legislation called for changes to @entity26 's immigration policy
@entity227 defectors said the bill did not cover full - year funding
@entity0 has until midnight to approve legislation
