by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:57 est , 23 june 2012 updated : 12:25 est , 23 june 2012 facing prison : handcuffed @entity3 leaving the court after being found guilty as @entity3 today faced up to 34 years in a @entity9 jail for killing her two children , a riddle over their paternity took a bizarre twist			1
it has been claimed that their mother had allegedly once worked as a prostitute offering ‘ personal services ’ to clients across the @entity17			1
police sources alleged her paedophile partner @entity20 would drive her to clients and wait in the car			2
the mystery over their true parentage was made deeper by the fact @entity26 was born in @entity27 , @entity28 , in 2004 , and @entity29 was born in @entity30 , in 2009			2
a senior police source in @entity32 said : ‘ in the 1990s , the family had very little money and at one stage were even forced to live for some time in a static caravan			2
‘ during this time @entity3 was offering " holistic " or " personal " services to a wide range of clients in the @entity17 , and @entity20 would drive her to one of these sessions and wait in the car while she conducted the business			1
‘ it is generally understood by those investigating the case that @entity48 was offering sexual services to those clients – that she was in fact a prostitute			2
’ no one from @entity48 's family could be contacted for comment on the allegations			0
her trial in @entity9 had heard the bombshell dna revelation that the children she suffocated were not fathered by @entity3 , but last night that claim was thrown into doubt			1
a court source said : ' @entity63 contacted the court some time ago to tell us the dna sample we were sent by the @entity32 authorities may not have been @entity20 's			1
' unanimous verdict : the jury rejected @entity3 's defence claim that she was mentally ill @entity26 was born on july 15 , 2004 , at @entity27 ’s @entity71			1
on her birth certificate , the father is named as @entity20 @entity74 , a ‘ music business manager ’			0
whether @entity3 was still offering ‘ personal services ’ to paying customers when her daughter was conceived - is unknown			1
but it was around that time , in 2003 , she and @entity20 broke up for around five months			0
@entity29 was conceived around september 2008 , nine months after the family had fled to @entity9 and were living together in a @entity30 apartment			0
@entity3 was aged 42 at the time			1
the boy was born at @entity83 hospital on the outskirts of @entity30 on june 28 , 2009			0
but yesterday @entity9 officials could find no record of his birth being formally registered			0
at the end of her trial earlier this week , @entity3 , from @entity88 , @entity89 , stared blankly at the floor as the unanimous guilty verdict rang out at @entity94 , in north - east @entity9			1
the 45 - year - old is now on suicide watch after previously trying to kill herself			0
after eight hours ’ deliberation , the jury foreman announced the panel of seven men and two women had believed @entity3 was ‘ fully conscious ’ and knew what she was doing when she smothered @entity26 , five , and 11 - month - old @entity29 in their beds in a @entity106 hotel			1
it means she faces spending the next three decades in a standard @entity9 prison cell , as the jury rejected an alternative verdict which would have allowed her to serve her sentence in a psychiatric wing			2
jurors agreed @entity3 , from @entity125 , @entity89 , did suffer from an unspecified psychosis and from depression – but ruled she was not criminally insane			1
they said she ‘ took advantage of the trust the children gave her as their mother ’ and their ‘ defencelessness ’ as sleeping children			0
judge @entity136 will sentence her at a later date			0
outside court , prosecutor @entity138 said : ‘ today justice has been done for two defenceless small children who were murdered in the most abominable and vile way – by their own mother			2
’ after the verdicts , the judge and lawyers in the case joined members of the jury in a local bar			2
during a four - day trial , the court heard how she killed the children after @entity3 , 46 , her fugitive partner , was arrested on child sex charges at their home in @entity30			1
the hypnotist , from @entity156 , hanged himself in jail in @entity158 in january after being reported for sexual abuse			0
@entity3 became obsessed with the idea that @entity32 social services would put the youngsters in care – which she considered a fate ‘ worse than death ’			1
she asked her daughter if she would prefer to spend a few brilliant days with her mother or a horrible lifetime without her			2
when @entity26 said she wanted to stay with her mother , @entity3 took the children to the resort of @entity173 to give them ‘ a perfect holiday ’			1
' conscious ' : the 45 - year - old looked on edge today as she waited to hear if the jury would accept her defence of mental illness @entity20 , who was found dead in his cell in january they checked into room 101 of the @entity184 on may 15 , 2010			1
after two days of playing together and posing for seaside snaps , she put them to bed at about 7pm and waited an hour until they were asleep			0
then she took a plastic shopping bag and suffocated them			0
the next day – having tried to commit suicide – she instructed reception to summon @entity9 police			0
during her trial @entity3 refused to answer more than 100 questions from prosecutor @entity138			1
the jury were shown a chilling video of @entity3 calmly confessing to detectives as she sat on a bed in the next - door hotel room			1
she told officers : ‘ i have ended the lives of my two children			0
' i gave the children a three - day holiday , a perfect holiday			0
i knew they were going to take my children to @entity209			0
‘ my intention was that my children and me together would go			0
it was n’t just the children			0
’ the court heard @entity3 was ‘ pathologically obsessed ’ with her partner @entity20 – they shared their surname but she was not his wife			1
as she was led away to the cells last night , @entity32 social services faced questions about their role in the tragedy			0
both @entity223 and @entity89 social services knew @entity26 was potentially at risk when @entity20 was arrested on november 1 , 2007 , on suspicion of rape @entity20 was previously thought to be the father of @entity29 and @entity26 , whom his partner has admitted killing in a @entity9 hotel room @entity3 admits suffocating @entity26 and @entity29 but claims to have been in an unsound mental state at the time of the killings @entity3 in court in yesterday , where she insisted the dna test results showing her partner was not the father of her two children must have been incorrect yet they allowed the family to flee to @entity9 before @entity26 could be taken to safety			1
last night a blame game erupted as @entity223 social services said they had passed the file to @entity89 , who said they were relying on the police to chase the family in @entity9			0
the @entity9 equivalent of social services claimed : ‘ nobody put us on alert and so nobody took any measures to protect the children			2
’ even after @entity20 was deported to the @entity32 , @entity89 social services did not ask its counterpart to retrieve @entity26 , and two weeks later she was dead			0
a @entity89 council spokesman said : ‘ during the short time the family were resident in @entity89 , the council did everything possible to initiate safeguarding procedures , and have assisted police fully in their continued investigations into this case			2
’ @entity3 is led into court yesterday after her lawyer called for her to be acquitted on mental health grounds @entity3 , pictured with her son @entity29 , was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner 's hanging in prison			1
