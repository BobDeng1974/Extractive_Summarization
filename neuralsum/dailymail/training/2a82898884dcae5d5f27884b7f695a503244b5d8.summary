by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 08:33 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 04:38 est , 2 october 2012 airlines are on course to nose - dive into the red as the number of first and business class passengers are slashed across @entity6 because of economic turbulence , high taxes and cost - cutting , air industry bosses revealed today			1
@entity6 carriers are expected to be worst affected and post combined losses of around £ 750million in 2012 , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) predicted today			1
the drop in lucrative first class and business class travel mirrors the poor economic climate as firms cut costs by sending their executives in economy , or fly with low - cost budget airlines			1
cutbacks : hard - pressed businesses are making more and more executives travel in economy class or with low cost airlines continental @entity6 countries hit by the eurozone debt and currency crisis are among the worst affected			1
the forecast has intensified calls by @entity33 airlines to reduce or scrap completely @entity33 ’s controversial @entity34 ( @entity34 ) airport departure tax – dubbed the ‘ poll - tax of the skies - which has increased steadily since its introduction in 1994			1
@entity11 also hinted at the lack of a controversial @entity42 runway at @entity43 which is bursting at the seams and operating at 99 per cent capacity as it noted : ' not only is the economy weak with the eurozone crisis , @entity6 has some very unfriendly conditions for doing business — onerous regulations , high taxes , insufficient capacity at many key airports and an air traffic management system badly in need of modernization			1
’ @entity11 said airlines in some countries were facing an ‘ uphill struggle with high taxes , onerous regulation and insufficient infrastructure ’			1
it noted that in july , on the lucrative @entity67 routes to and from the @entity68 , first class and business class travel - known as premium travel - was 2.4 % down on the same time last year			1
but within @entity6 in july 2012 premium travel was down even more – by 3.5 %			1
' poll - tax of the skies ' : the poor results will intensify calls for a reduction in @entity33 @entity34 @entity11 said : ‘ @entity6 airlines are expected to post the largest loss of any region			1
while governments and the @entity81 have taken measures to shore up confidence in the euro , these have been fraught with political difficulties			0
‘ additionally , the region is plagued by high taxes , inefficient air traffic management infrastructure and an onerous regulatory environment			0
’ overall , @entity11 predicted that world airline profits will reach around £ 2.56 billion in 2012 - a dip on the 2011 figure of around £ 5.25 billion in 2011 but higher than @entity11 ’s forecast for this year made in june 2012			1
capacity : the report 's criticisms will be siezed on by supporters of a third runway at @entity43 speaking in @entity101 today , @entity11 director general and chief executive @entity99 said : ‘ aviation has an important role to play as the global economy struggles			1
growth is the only way forward and a healthy aviation industry can stimulate that - linking stagnating developed economies to robust emerging markets			2
‘ aviation connectivity spurs growth at both ends			0
that is why it is important for governments to ensure aviation ’s ability to be a catalyst for growth is not constrained			0
‘ unfortunately , in many parts of the world , it is an uphill struggle with high taxes , onerous regulation and insufficient infrastructure			0
all of this stunts industry growth to the detriment of the world economy			2
’ on a knife - edge : the airline industry has struggled to adapt to rising oil prices he added : ’ @entity6 is among the regions most in need of the economic growth that aviation can provide			1
yet we still see high taxes , cumbersome regulation and capacity constraints			2
there are lessons for @entity6 to learn from other parts of the world			1
’ mr @entity99 said that airlines were nevertheless doing well to cope with the difficult economic times : ‘ even six years ago , generating a profit with oil at $ 110/barrel ( @entity151 ) would have been unthinkable			2
the industry has re-shaped itself to cope by investing in new fleets , adopting more efficient processes , carefully managing capacity and consolidating			2
but despite these efforts , the industry ’s profitability still balances on a knife - edge , with profit margins that do not cover the cost of capital			0
’ he added : ‘ aviation has an important role to play as the global economy struggles			0
growth is the only way forward and a healthy aviation industry can stimulate that — linking stagnating developed economies to robust emerging markets			0
mixed fortunes : @entity175 parent @entity173 says demand demand for premium leisure travel is up , but is heading towards a ' small operating loss ' for 2012 @entity175 ’ parent company @entity173 , which also oversees @entity180 ’s @entity179 , said it did not make specific predictions on future premium traffic by region			2
but it admitted it is heading towards ‘ a small operating loss ’ for this year			0
it said it had bucked the trend in august and seen its global premium traffic rise by 12.6 per cent compared with last year			0
this , it said , reflected @entity175 ’ successful commercial strategy to stimulate demand for first and business class leisure travel			0
but in its trading outlook disclosed on august 3 for its second quarter results , @entity173 reported : ‘ we were previously targeting a break - even operating result this year , after the impact of restructuring costs and the short term earnings drag from the bmi acquisition			0
however , in the light of the @entity180 macro headwind , we now expect to make a small operating loss in 2012			2
‘ last month @entity173 added : ‘ underlying market conditions remain unchanged from guidance given at @entity209 results			0
trading conditions at our @entity212 hub remain firm			0
