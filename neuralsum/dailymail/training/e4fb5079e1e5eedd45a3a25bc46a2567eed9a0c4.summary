they then went to the police station and the child provided a urine sample which tested positive for cocaine			2
' the 13 - year - old boy later told police ' loads of people turned up to the party ' and he had vodka and cocaine			1
mr @entity71 said : ' he said at some point everyone seemed to go to the kitchen so he and another teenager went in and people were taking cocaine			2
' he said there were numerous small bags on the worktops containing what he presumed to be cocaine and they were making it into lines and snorting it through straws			2
' he said another teenager was taking it , as well as @entity8 , @entity48 and various others who were present			1
he said the teenager he was with asked @entity48 if she would ' sort my mate out , ' at which point she handed him a key with cocaine on , telling him not to grass			1

he took the cocaine through a straw , like everybody else was doing			2
' the 15 - year - old girl at the party said she was given cocaine by @entity48 after she asked for some			1
mr @entity71 said : ' she said she saw both the defendants taking lines of cocaine			2
people were taking it off keys and doing lines when they split it with a credit card and snorted it through a straw or a rolled up note			0

@entity8 initially claimed nobody was taking any drugs at her house and said she had never taken cocaine			1
but when she was later interviewed she admitted she allowed her premises to be used for drugs usage			2
' she stated she worked alongside social services as a support worker for families and children and drug use would not be encouraged in any way by her employers , ' said mr @entity71			2
@entity8 's defence lawyer mr @entity183 said his client had since referred herself for counselling and now working for a charity for the homeless , advising on housing issues			2
he said : ' her behaviour was abhorrent morally and i can understand public disgust at it - but this young woman had a blip			0

' she worked for social services			0
she thought she could n't ask for help as she thought that is being a failure , ' he said			0
@entity8 ( not pictured ) was seen ' gurning with her jaw swinging ' after taking drugs at the all - night party ' she was isolated			1
she sought solace in drink which had a slippery slope to drugs			0
she 's not proud for doing that but that 's an explanation as to why the events came about			0
' the arrest was a wake - up call and she had realised her behaviour was not acceptable to her and to society			0
she is now using her life experience she gained as a result of this offending to assist others			0
' @entity48 claimed she did n't get @entity8 ' hooked on cocaine and she was already a user when they met			1
in mitigation @entity223 , for @entity48 , said her behaviour , committed when she was in drink and had taken drugs herself , had been dreadful and disgraceful and she had now sought counselling			1
he added : ' any person hearing of that sort of behaviour , giving a young child a @entity233 drug , merely because he 's asked for it , would be absolutely horrified			0
casual drug taking is no longer for her			0
she seems to have turned the corner			0
she seems to have realised that she really has got to stop doing that			0
' she is ashamed and upset			0
she is dismayed at what she did			0
she realises she has behaved in a way no right - thinking person would condone			0
it 's a completely thoughtless and stupid thing for her to have done and she knows that			0
' judge @entity243 , @entity244 , said the party involved ' disgraceful and very serious criminal behaviour '			0
but he decided it was appropriate to suspended the custodial sentence on @entity8 ' after some misgivings			2
' he told her : ' the acts done by you are not all that different to the acts done by @entity253			0
