by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 05:16 est , 23 march 2012 @entity2 ’s personal finances came under fierce scrutiny yesterday after he insisted he was not wealthy enough to pay the 50p tax rate			1
sources close to the prime minister admitted that @entity7 does earn more than the £ 150,000 threshold for top - rate tax – and will benefit from the announcement that it will be cut to 45p			1
but the @entity11 , who earns a @entity13 salary of £ 134,565 , insisted he would not benefit from his own policy			1
@entity2 and his wife @entity15			0
he earns a @entity13 salary of £ 134,565 and insisted he would not benefit from his own policy			1
mr @entity2 and his wife receive a six - figure annual income from letting their £ 3m home during a @entity22 radio interview , mr @entity2 was adamant : ‘ my salary is less than the £ 150,000 threshold ... so i am not personally affected			1
’ quizzed about other income which might take him over the threshold , he replied : ‘ i am not a big winner from this budget			0
’ asked again if he was a 50p tax rate payer , the chancellor – one of the wealthiest @entity13 members – added : ‘ i ’m not actually , no. ’ but his claim appeared to be unravelling last night as it emerged that while mr @entity2 may not be paying the full rate this financial year , he probably will have to pay the 50p rate in his next tax return			1
the chancellor would need extra income of just £ 15,435 to reach the £ 150,000 threshold – and eventually benefit from his controversial decision to cut the top rate			2
sources close to the prime minister admitted that @entity7 does earn more than the £ 150,000 threshold for top - rate tax and will benefit from the announcement that it will be cut to 45p during a series of interviews , mr @entity2 failed to mention an additional six - figure annual income he and wife @entity49 receive from letting their £ 3million home in @entity52 , one of the wealthiest parts of @entity55			1
mr @entity2 ’s tax return for 2010 - 11 would not have included the lucrative rental income that began flowing into the @entity2 bank account months later			1
family fortune : the chancellor 's father 17th @entity62 sir @entity60 ( standing ) and @entity63 , the co-founders of @entity66 design nor did he talk about his shareholding in the family ’s upmarket fabrics and wallpaper firm @entity66 , reputed to be worth more than £ 4million			1
@entity72 leader @entity71 said : ‘ we were all astonished to learn from the chancellor this morning that he was not a top - rate taxpayer			0
‘ the hunt is now on for the name of his accountant , who will surely find himself in spectacular demand			0
’ mr @entity2 , who told @entity81 during his @entity83 speech that he regarded ‘ tax evasion and , indeed , aggressive tax avoidance , as morally repugnant ’ , refused to discuss his personal finances in detail last night			2
an aide insisted he was not a tax dodger but made clear his denial that he pays 50p tax only covers his last tax return – a legalistic distinction unlikely to be appreciated by voters struggling to make ends meet			1
an aide to the chancellor told the @entity98 : ‘ in the most recent tax year , @entity2 was a higher rate taxpayer [ the 40p rate ]			2
‘ he has his salary and part of the rental income from one property that has a mortgage on it			0
he makes no use of tax avoidance schemes			0
’ asked if the chancellor would pay the 50p rate in his 2011/12 tax return , one source said : ‘ you ca n’t say that for certain			2
he goes through the normal process of self - assessment and those things are worked out later			0
’ but the source repeatedly declined the opportunity to deny that mr @entity2 was likely to have earned enough over the past year to put him in the top tier of taxpayers			0
according to the @entity81 ’ register of interests , mr @entity2 declares two additional sources of income apart from his ministerial salary – rental from a ‘ residential property in @entity55 , ’ and ‘ registrable shareholdings ’ in @entity66			0
the chancellor only registered the rental income from july last year , when he moved his family from their elegant five - storey @entity52 home into the flat above 10 @entity139			1
similar houses in the trendy @entity55 area can command rentals of upwards of £ 4,000 a week – giving mr @entity2 and his novelist wife a potential extra income of well over £ 200,000 a year			2
however , @entity147 documents show the house is jointly owned by @entity2 and mrs @entity149 and there are two mortgages – one with @entity152 and another with a private bank – registered against the property			0
wealthy : @entity2 with his wife @entity15 , the elder daughter of conservative cabinet minister @entity157 of @entity158 , who he married in 1998 it is not known how much the @entity161 have to pay in monthly mortgage repayments , but they could legitimately cut the size of their tax bill by off - setting both mortgage interest payments and any maintenance costs			2
this would have the effect of cutting the ‘ profit ’ they made each month on the house			0
mr @entity2 is also a beneficiary of a trust fund which owns 15 per cent of the @entity66 family business founded by his father , the baronet sir @entity60			1
according to accounts filed at @entity176 the firm , which has a turnover of £ 23million , has suffered losses for the past three years and no dividend was paid to shareholders in the last financial year – but £ 1,476,720 was paid out in 2010			0
aides suggested the chancellor did not draw an income from his shareholding in the last tax year .			0

@entity2 earns £ 134,565 as chancellor - just over £ 15,000 short of 50p tax threshold
he rents out @entity192 home while living in 10 @entity139 flat
@entity2 has 15 *%* stake in family wallpaper business which is worth an estimated £ 4million
