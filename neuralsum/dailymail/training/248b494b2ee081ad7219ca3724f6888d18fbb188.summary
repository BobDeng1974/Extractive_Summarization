by @entity0 @entity2 ’s three - year drought has prompted a new gold rush in the same @entity5 foothills that drew legions of fortune seekers from around the world in the mid- 1800s			1
the dry conditions mean streams and other water pools started to dry up from the drought , exposing areas that previously could not be explored due to the the depth of the water			2
the gold rush from december to january saw amateur prospectors dig for riverbed riches in spots that have been out of reach for decades			1
' having the ' gut ' of the stream dry out , gives miners access to move boulders and access cracks and crevices in the center of the stream or at least in what would be the center of the stream during flood stage			2
' without water , miners can get in and try to get to the bedrock where the best gold will usually be in a protected place there			1
without water , miners can get in and try to get to the bedrock where the best gold will usually be in a protected place there the gold rush from december to january saw amateur prospectors dig for riverbed riches in spots that have been out of reach for decades mr @entity23 displays a small vial of gold flakes found while gold panning along the @entity29 @entity23 , recently left the military and has been prospecting several times a week this winter - a time when it 's usually raining and river levels are too high for gold panning ' with the drought going on , we 're able to dig in more locations that would n't be accessible at later times , ' said @entity23 , who wore waterproof overalls as he panned in the @entity29 near @entity30 with his teenage daughter on a recent friday afternoon			1
on january 24 , 1848 , @entity87 , a carpenter originally from @entity88 , found flakes of gold in the @entity91 at the base of the @entity5 near @entity93 , @entity2			1
' it made my heart thump , for i was certain it was gold , ' he later recalled			2
@entity87 shared the discovery with ( @entity101 ) @entity100 who employed @entity87 to build his mill. the discovery of gold nuggets meant all the men working on the mill left to find their fortune in gold and it eventually fell into disrepair			1
news of @entity87 ’s discovery brought thousands of immigrants to @entity2 from elsewhere in the @entity113 and from other countries , prompting the gold rush of 1849			1
the large influx of ' 49ers , ' as the gold prospectors were known , caused @entity2 's population to increase dramatically as migrants from across the world came to @entity113 to make their fortune			1
this influx of migrants made it one of the most ethnically diverse states by the middle of the 19th century			0
@entity23 , a 38 - year - old from @entity126 who recently left the military , has been prospecting several times a week this winter - a time when it 's usually raining and river levels are too high for gold panning			1
leaning over a bed of rocks , @entity23 reached into the river and scooped shovelfuls of sand into a plastic bucket			0
he and his daughter then poured the sand into a sluice box that 's used to trap gold flakes on textured rubber mats			2
' if you see a good - sized flake , that 's when you get excited , ' said @entity23 , as he looked for gold in one of the sluice box trays			1
@entity150 walked along the dry rocks of the @entity29 with a shovel and pan , surveying the riverbed for good spots for prospecting			2
' i do understand that it 's a dramatic impact on everybody during a drought that 's this severe , but at the same token i 'm taking advantage of it , ' said @entity150 , 39 , an amateur prospector who lives in the @entity30 area			2
one of the worst droughts in @entity2 history has prompted the state and federal governments to severely cut water supplies to farms and cities			2
it 's also left rivers and streams at dangerously low levels , imperiling fish and wildlife			1
' you 're seeing flows that are either at or near record lows , ' said @entity182 , a hydrologist with the @entity184 's @entity183			0
' if this drought were to continue into future years , there could be some severe consequences			0
' the drought has exposed old roads , bridges , railway lines and junked cars that are usually submerged in lakes and reservoirs			0
at the @entity198 reservoir , the water 's retreat revealed the remnants of a @entity201 mining town called @entity202 , which was flooded when the dam was built in the 1950s			0
in mountain rivers and streams , the record - low flows have uncovered new chances to earn some extra money			1
@entity209 , manager of the @entity210 , of @entity211 , @entity2 , goes over a map of areas open to gold panning with prospective gold prospector @entity215 the various tools needed for gold panning are displayed for sale at the shop the warm , dry winter is bringing in many first - time prospectors to @entity223 in the @entity201 - era town of @entity211			1
the store sells shovels , buckets , pans , rubber boots , maps and mining books , as well as more advanced prospecting equipment such as sluice boxes and gold concentrators			0
with good jobs in short supply and gold selling for more than $ 1,300 an ounce , many local residents are prospecting to supplement their incomes , said store manager @entity209			0
her father , @entity241 , who opened the mining store nearly 40 years ago , said business has increased 20 to 25 percent because of the drought			0
but he 's concerned about the lack of rain because he lives in the mountains and worries about forest fires			0
' it 's great for business , but i 'd rather see no drought and a lot of rain , ' @entity241 said			0
@entity241 sold a 4 - foot metal sluice box to amateur prospector @entity257 and his friend			0
' the word is definitely out , ' @entity257 said			0
' we 've seen more people prospecting than usual			0
' he said water levels at the @entity264 of the @entity91 are about 2 feet below normal , which has opened up new areas for gold panning			1
' it 's more of a hobby , ' @entity257 said , ' but obviously if we hit a nice pocket , then yeah , i would love to make some money			0

low water levels have led to a mini gold rush in the @entity5 foothills
same area that drew fortune seekers in the mid- 1800s
gold rush from december - january saw amateurs dig for riverbed riches
lack of water means miners try to get to the bedrock where the best gold is
