fresh from his @entity2 triumph , @entity0 made a visit to the observation deck of the @entity5 on monday , and of course the @entity7 record - equalling champion was still proudly sporting his green jacket			1
@entity0 broke several scoring records on the way to his four - stroke victory , including equalling the 18 - under total set by @entity14 in 1997 and becoming the championship 's second - youngest winner of all time			1
and the magnitude of his achievement still did n't seem to have sunk in yet as @entity0 took in the press attention which included his trip to the top of the 25th - tallest completed skyscraper in the world which was lit up in green and yellow later in the evening			1
fresh from his @entity2 triumph , @entity0 visited to the observation deck of the @entity5 the @entity7 record - equalling champion was still proudly sporting his green jacket as he snapped a selfie ' it 's all run together			1
it all happened quickly , ' @entity0 said			1
' sometimes it feels like a long time ago			2
and sometimes it feels like yesterday			2
all in all , it 's really cool			0
' it was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried him to a four - shot victory sunday			2
he watched @entity38 celebrate another @entity2 title , and all the perks and celebrity that came with it			1
he knew that could have been him			0
' so you get reminded of it all the time , because when you 're @entity2 champion , it 's a different legacy , ' @entity0 said			1
' and so that definitely left me hungry			0
and then also , having a chance to win the last couple of week and not pulling it off			0
' he was runner - up in the @entity52 and lost in a playoff at the @entity54 before arriving at @entity7			1
the world 's media were keen to get even more footage of the @entity7 champion after his big weekend it was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried @entity0 to victory and the legacy he craved ' so the combination of the two allowed me to keep my head down , not worry about anyone else in the field except myself and to play a golf course that is my favorite course in the world , ' he said			1
the par - 5 eighth hole is where it all started to go wrong last year			0
he had a two - shot lead and made bogey to @entity38 's birdie			0
on the ninth hole , @entity0 's shot came up a fraction short and tumbled down the front of the green and back into the fairway , leading to another bogey			1
@entity38 birdied and suddenly was two shots ahead , and @entity0 did n't have the power or the putting to catch up			1
his lead down to three shots , @entity0 made a simple birdie on the eighth hole			1
this time , his approach on the ninth was fraction long enough to land on the ridge and stay put			0
he made par , and @entity92 had a three - putt bogey to fall five shots behind			0
he was runner - up in the @entity52 and lost in a playoff at the @entity54 before arriving at @entity7 @entity38 presents @entity0 with the green jacket after his 18 - under total secured him the victory there was only one shaky moment after that			1
@entity0 was four shots ahead and looking at a two - shot swing on the 16th when @entity106 had 15 feet for birdie and @entity0 faced an 8 - foot putt for @entity109 missed			1
he was on his way			0
' it was probably one of the best putts he hit all day , ' @entity106 said			0
it 's tempting to declare @entity0 as golf 's next big star after such a performance and the elite company he joins			2
in the last century , only four players have three @entity120 titles that include a major before turning 22 - @entity0 , @entity14 , @entity122 and @entity123			2
he was the first wire - to - wire winner at @entity7 in 39 years			2
he already is no 2 in the world , and he still has work to do to reach @entity126 at @entity127			0
@entity92 praised @entity0 's put on the 16th that he missed to set him on his way as ' one of the best ' golf is craving a rivalry , and this has all the trappings of one , especially because the world ranking has never had no 1 and no 2 both 25 or younger			2
it 's worth waiting to see if other young players emerge the rest of the year in the majors , such as @entity140 or even @entity141 , who finished fifth			0
but that friday at @entity7 , when @entity0 shot 66 and built a five - shot lead , felt a lot like friday at @entity145 when @entity126 began to bury the @entity147 open field in 2011			1
' he 's way more mature than i was at 21 , and a hell of a golfer and a great person as well , ' @entity126 said			0
@entity126 is currently world no 1 and while @entity0 is far behind at @entity154 , golf is craving a top rivalry @entity126 was not ready to think about a rivalry , even though he stated his goal very clearly that he wants to be no 1			1
this was a big step , but it was only a step			0
' he 's got four majors , ' @entity0 said of @entity126			2
' that 's something i can still only dream about			0
' if history is any indication , the kid is a quick study			0
and he seems to be in a hurry to get where he 's going .			0
