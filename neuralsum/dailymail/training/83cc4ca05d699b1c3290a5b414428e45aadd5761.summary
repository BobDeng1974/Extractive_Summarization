international gran of mystery : @entity2 has had an international criminal career spanning six decades , but now faces two years jail for her latest scam when the sweet octogenarian @entity8 lady walked into @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , last october , staff were delighted			1
white - haired and petite , not in the best of health but articulate and elegantly turned out , she told them she had just had a $ 25,000 insurance payout and wanted to spend the cash on a present for herself			1
salespeople fussed around her with typical @entity11 courtesy , helping her try on gem - encrusted necklaces and rings and , when her hip began playing up , finding her a chair to rest her legs			2
after making arrangements to complete her purchase of a diamond and white gold pinkie ring the next day , they helped her hobble to the door			1
what staff did not realise was that the $ 22,500 the ring was still on her finger			1
' @entity35 ' @entity2 , the world 's most unlikely international jewel thief , had struck again			1
within minutes she had sold on the ring for a mere $ 800 at a nearby pawnshop			1
unfortunately for @entity2 , authorities are now so familiar with her history that they were quick to catch her			1
the 83 - year - old has gained infamy for a six - decade criminal career during which she has travelled the world to swipe millions of dollars worth of jewels by making staff ' forget ' she was carrying them			1
over time , she has been connected to 20 aliases , nine dates of birth , and five social security numbers , but is nevertheless so brazen about her crimes that she once gave her occupation as ' jewel thief ' in court papers			0
but the international lifestyle has come at a heavy price for the cunning coal - miner 's daughter : she has an @entity61 file dating back to the 1970s , a @entity63 criminal record 20 pages long and has served a string of jail terms			1
she had been free for only three months before pulling off her latest scam			0
@entity68 in @entity10 , @entity11 : @entity2 had told staff at the shop she had a $ 25,000 dollar insurance payout to spend and got them to help her try on a range of rings and necklaces so notorious is @entity2 , she has even been the subject of a documentary , @entity78 , and it is rumoured that a biopic is in the works with @entity83 winner @entity82 cast in the starring role			1
born to a coal mining father and a seamstress mother in the remote and impoverished town of @entity89 , @entity90 , in 1930 , @entity85 was the youngest of six children			0
a ring like the one @entity93 stole from @entity94 : so caught up were workers in making sure she was properly looked after , they did n't realise she had it on although a family move to @entity101 , @entity102 , when broadened her horizons somewhat as a teenager , she still faced the injustice and suppression that was the lot of many black women in those days of @entity8 history			2
@entity109 , producer of @entity78 , told the @entity111 's @entity110 : ' she always wanted to become a ballerina but one day somebody told her she could n't - there were no black ballerinas			2
' she realised she had to find another way of getting out of that small town and seeing the world			0
stealing jewels eventually became the way she did it			1
' in the documentary , @entity2 revealed how she first learned her trademark distraction trick as a teenager when a store clerk eagerly ditched her when a white customer came in			1
she walked to the door , a small gold watch still clasped around her wrist			0
although she gave it back that time , she realised how easy it would have been to walk away with the prize			0
from there , she worked her way up from bargain jewellery to some of the most expensive stores across the globe , hitting targets as far afield as @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and even @entity144			0
well known to police : so notorious is @entity2 she has even been the subject of a documentary , the life and crimes of @entity2 , and it is rumoured a biopic is in the works starring oscar - winner @entity82 ' there ’s never been a day that i went to steal that i did not get what i went to do , ' she said in the documentary			1
' i do n’t have any regrets about stealing jewelry			2
' that sentiment proves problematic for judges faced with the elderly offender			0
in 2010 , she asked one to be lenient because she was ' truly sorry that this went on as long as it did , ' but that was n't enough			0
' you wo n't stop , ' judge @entity165 said at the time , explaining his decision to sentence her to five years which was at the high end of the possible verdicts			0
' that ’s the problem here ... she ’s a thief			0
@entity175 ’s wife , that ’s who she is			0
' all a ruse : over time , she has been connected to 20 aliases , nine dates of birth , and five social security numbers ( @entity2 pictured in a @entity185 courtroom in 2005 ) after that punitive sentence , @entity2 vowed to leave her life of crime			2
but today she is back behind bars , facing two years inside and a further two years probation			0
' the judge tempered punishment with compassion about her age , ' her attorney attorney @entity191 told the @entity196 last week			2
' he took into account the taxpayers ' pocketbook			0
and do we really need to incarcerate a non-violent offender - yes , a repeat offender , that 's true - who 's ill , who has emphysema , who 's elderly ? '			2

@entity2 is infamous for a six - decade career swiping precious gems
she walks into jewellers and asks to try on their wares and chats to them
then , when they forget she is still carrying the jewels , she walks out
she is now in jail after last week *admitting* stealing a $ *22k* diamond ring
