by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 7 april 2012 updated : 04:59 est , 9 april 2012 hotel hopper : billionaire business tycoon @entity3 , pictured with designer @entity4 last year , has chosen not to own a house because he 's ' not interested ' in material possessions like most nomads , @entity3 travels light			1
he does n't own a house , car or even a watch and the few belongings he does have are carried around in a paper bag			1
possessions have ' zero appeal ' , he says			0
it 's our actions that have real value			1
but what sets the 50 - year - old apart from nearly all other homeless people is the small matter of his £ 1.5billion fortune			1
@entity3 got rid of his @entity26 pad and private island 12 years ago			1
home is far more transient nowadays			0
life for him is a jet - set one - trotting the globe , hanging out with beautiful women and staying in luxury hotels , sometimes in 14 different cities in a month as he builds his enormous business empire			0
his most recent acquisition has been a £ 881million stake in @entity40			1
but in spite of his wealth , the @entity43 - @entity42 tycoon insists he does n't need , or want , material goods			0
' possessing things is not interesting , ' he told the @entity48			2
' living in grand environments to show myself and others that i have wealth has zero appeal			0
' whatever i own is temporary , since we 're only here for a short period of time			2
it 's our actions that will last for ever			1
' @entity3 was born into a privileged family ( his @entity65 father , @entity64 , was a wealthy art dealer who befriended @entity66 ) in @entity67 in 1961			1
he had a rebellious streak when growing up - getting expelled for ' insubordination ' from a @entity71 boarding school and once vowing he would n't learn ' a word of @entity73 ' because it was the language of imperialism			0
he did , however , move away from that view and went on to study finance at university in @entity26			0
@entity78 : the 50 - year - old often hangs out with beautiful women like @entity81 ( left ) on his jet - set travels happier now : @entity3 , posing with actress @entity83 in 2009 , says he prefers living like a nomad in 1988 , he jointly founded hedge fund @entity85 and later created @entity86 , which bought slices of firms around the world			1
one of these was @entity42 department store @entity90 , which he acquired for one euro and then saved 25,000 jobs there by investing £ 40million			2
he 's never revealed why , but in 2000 he had something of an epiphany and vowed to give away most of his wealth			1
in that year , he sold his @entity97 home in @entity26 - and his private island off @entity99 - and focused instead on his hotel - hopping travels , staying at some of the world 's finest establishments such as @entity104 's in @entity105			2
mingling with the rich and famous , he holds an annual @entity107 party at @entity109 @entity108 , where he hosts celebrities such as @entity111 and @entity112			0
transient : the exclusive @entity115 's hotel ( above ) in @entity116 , @entity105 , is among the temporary homes used by the @entity67 - born entrepreneur celebrity friends : @entity3 holds an annual @entity107 party at @entity109 @entity108 ( above ) for stars such as @entity111 and @entity112 he told the @entity48 : ' i have always spent a lot of time in hotels , so it started to seem easier to do this			1
' i am not that attached to material things			2
i have very few possessions			0
luckily , as a man , you do n't need much			0
' @entity3 is one of more than 50 billionaires who have agreed to give away at least half of their fortunes			1
he spends millions buying artworks by @entity134 and @entity135 just to hand them to museums for free			0
and last year he spent £ 12million on a campaign to save @entity139 from its crippling debts			2
perhaps a homeless charity will be next on his list .			0

@entity3 , 50 , has £ 1.5billion fortune **...** but plans to give half away
has bought £ 881m stake in @entity40 **...** but carries things in paper bag
' whatever i own is only temporary . it 's our actions that have real value '
