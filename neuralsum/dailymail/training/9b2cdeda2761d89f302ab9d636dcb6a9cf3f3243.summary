by @entity0 a wannabe glamour model who received a free @entity3 breast enlargement has hit out at a decision to stop her taxpayer - funded taxi trips to take her children to school			1
@entity8 , 23 , who is heavily pregnant with her third child , started receiving the £ 6,000 - a - year state - funded transport after complaining about the ' negative attention ' she receives on public transport			1
however , @entity14 has now decided to axe the daily luxury – much to the annoyance of the expectant mother who once said : ‘ @entity18 may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me			1
’ she said today : ' if the council think i ’m getting a bus , they can think again			0
she has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories , including how she received @entity45 on the @entity3 for a sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the chance to appear on @entity49			0
despite the controversy , she continued to soak up public funds by making the most of the state - funded taxis which drove her and her two children , aged three and six , the two - and - a - half mile journey to and from the local school , twice a day			1
she received the free transport on health grounds , after claiming the stress of unwanted ‘ negative attention ’ was giving her anxiety attacks			1
the journey , which she has been doing since may at a cost of £ 150 - a - week , would only cost around £ 30 - a - week by bus			2
it could be part of the reason why @entity14 has now decided to put an end to the twice - daily trips			2
the wannabe glamour model has previously boasted about the state - handouts she has received on @entity72 the 23 - year - old is expecting her third child after falling pregnant while working as a £ 1,000 - a - night escort ms @entity8 , from @entity76 , said the council initially tried to halve the bill by taking her children to school with a chaperone – but pulled it altogether when she complained			1
she told @entity83 : ‘ they told me that if i was n’t on the journey , the cost would be reduced			0
‘ i refused to let my kids get into a car with someone i ’ve never met			0
i kicked off and they said the taxis would stop			0
’ ms @entity8 said she would be appealing the decision and would even consider moving her children to a different school			2
it comes while she is heavily pregnant with her third child , who she fell pregnant with while working as a £ 1,000 - a - night escort			0
she has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her unborn child is and has also admitted to considering having the unborn baby aborted so she could appear on @entity99 ’s @entity49			0
ms @entity8 , who formerly worked as an escort , caused controversy earlier this year after admitting that she had considered having her unborn baby aborted so she could appear on @entity99 ’s @entity49 she said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy			2
it was while working as an escort that ms @entity8 had the breast augmentation which she has become infamously known for			2
the operation was funded by the same @entity3 trust which refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two - year - old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk			1
after the enlargement , ms @entity8 claimed her breasts were ‘ so big ’ she found them embarrassing , and enraged the nation further by claiming the @entity3 should pay for a reduction			1
she then tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash but admitted she could not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant			0
@entity123 has contacted @entity14 for comment .			0
