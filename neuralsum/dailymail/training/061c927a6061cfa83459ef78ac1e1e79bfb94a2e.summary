within 30 years , a futurist believes babies will regularly born in artificial wombs , outside of human bodies			1

the technology , known as ectogenesis , has been in development since 2001 and previous experiments involved growing mouse embryos in wombs attached to ‘ placenta machines			1
’ campaigners believe it could reduce the number of still births , because foetuses would be more closely monitored and accessible , but critics claim it could redefine social roles			2
others have stated it removes the bond between a mother and her child			2
@entity28 is the growth of an organism outside of a body , and applies to animals as well as the growth of bacteria			0
artificial wombs need an artificial uterus that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the foetus			1
custom - built amniotic fluid sacs would also need to remove waste			0
this would be attached to an ‘ placenta machine ’ , and cables could monitor everything from the baby ’s weight to heart rate and development			1
it could be used for women who are unable to carry babies naturally , due to a damaged uterus for example			1
the technology may also remove the need for surrogate mothers for straight and gay couples			1
elsewhere , artificial wombs would reduce the number of pregnancy and birth - related deaths among women , could extend the age at which women give birth , and drugs could be more easily administered to the foetus if it became ill. @entity70 - @entity69 futurist @entity68 told @entity71 he believes the technology will be ready to use within 20 years , and become widely available in 30			1
he claimed much of the technology already exists , but legal and ethical concerns will result in human trials being delayed			1
@entity28 was coined in 1924 by @entity77 scientist @entity76 who predicted that by 2074 only 30 per cent of births would be natural , human births			0
in 2001 , @entity80 of @entity81 began growing sheets of endometrial tissue , and used them to create a uterus			1
they were tested using human embryos , which began to successfully grow , but had to be removed due to the laws of growing humans in a lab. in 2001 , @entity80 of @entity81 began growing sheets of endometrial tissue , and used them to create a uterus			1
two years later , professor @entity80 grew mouse embryos in an artificial womb , ( pictured ) however they did not grow to full - term and were left deformed two years later , professor @entity80 grew mouse embryos in an artificial womb , however they did not grow to full - term and were left deformed			1
in 2009 , researchers at @entity99 announced they had created human sperm cells from embryonic tissue			1
‘ no doubt , propagating the species without the need for the human body sounds insanely far - fetched			0
' and even if it ’s achievable , there ’s the question of whether people would be comfortable using it			0
i would argue yes , ’ said @entity112			0
elsewhere , women who want an abortion could opt to place the embryo in an artificial womb so someone else could adopt it			2
in 2012 , feminist and activist @entity118 raised criticisms about the technology			2
she said : ‘ women already have the power to eliminate men and in their collective wisdom have decided to keep them			0
‘ the real question now is , will men , once the artificial womb is perfected , want to keep women around ? @entity28 is the growth of an organism outside of a body			2
artificial wombs need an artificial uterus that supplies nutrients and oxygen to a foetus , which is created using current fertilisation technology			1

‘ the real question now is , will men , once the artificial womb is perfected , want to keep women around ? ' @entity144 image pictured ‘ the bottom line is that men do n’t need women ’s help to replace women , but the women still need men ’s help to replace men			2
’ while author @entity161 added : ‘ right wing anti-choice activists , although perhaps initially delighted to have an alternative to abortion , will have to contend with a radical redefinition of ‘ motherhood ’			0
‘ there is no guarantee these changes will be good for women who currently already struggle to defend reproductive freedoms			0
’ and political philosopher @entity170 continued : ‘ just as pregnancy is a dangerous , often difficult and burdensome undertaking , [ foetuses ] are not simple clumps of cells - they ’re potential persons			0
‘ were ectogenesis an option , relieving a potential mother of the burden of pregnancy would no longer require termination			2
' with her interests intact , i see no reason why the genetic mother should be empowered with life and death authority			0
authority over her body , yes			0
but assuming it ’s healthy , not over the [ child ’s ] life			0

ectogenesis technology has been in development since 2001
researchers have previously used tissue to create a *freestanding* uterus
this technology was later used to grow mouse embryos in artificial wombs
futurist @entity68 believes the technology will be ready by 2034
it could then be made more widely available a decade later
the issued raises the debate about whether the technology is ethical
