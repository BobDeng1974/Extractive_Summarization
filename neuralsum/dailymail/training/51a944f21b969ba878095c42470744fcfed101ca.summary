a young elephant got thoroughly punished for his bad behaviour when he was forced to stay out in the rain while the rest of the heard sheltered under a tree			1

the family quarrel , preceded by what appears to be a ' trunk war ' took place in the @entity15 , @entity16 , naughty step : a young bull elephant is made to stay out in the rain - possibly for his bad behaviour - while his family huddle under an acacia tree the herd of elephants was captured by @entity26 , a scientist from @entity27 , @entity28 , who was visiting the @entity15			1
mr @entity26 , 37 , said he spotted the elephants underneath the acacia tree as he was also seeking shelter from the oncoming storm			1
he said : ' i was n't sure if these elephants were there to hide from the rain or not because i thought thick skinned animals like elephants do not usually care much about the rain			0
' not until we got very close to the tree did i realise there was this little elephant calf standing alone in the rain , with all others under the tree			2
' teenage tantrum : the young bull elephant appears to have been causing trouble earlier on ' one , two , three , four , i declare a trunk war ' : the elephant and an older relative have it out the herd of elephants was captured by @entity26 , a scientist from @entity27 , who was visiting the @entity56 ' i was rather intrigued by the fact he was standing away from the tree alone , where all his companions congregate , in my understanding deliberately as he had his face away from the rest of the group			1
' it was a very interesting moment because it reflects some peculiar behaviour about these animals			0
' they are highly social most of the time but like us they can have a temper or small fights			0
' the calves can have their rebellious moments , and like us , they may sometimes prefer some alone time			0
' muddled up : a very young elephant has had a dirty bath on the @entity15 playtime : two elephants from the same herd enjoyed some leisure time in the water 's edge before the storm			2
