a facebook page has been created for users to report incidents of ' @entity3 ' and anti-muslim sentiments as the @entity6 fears backlash after the counter-terror raids that took place on thursday morning			1
' @entity9 ' was created on @entity10 just two days before @entity11 experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country 's history			1
the operation saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across @entity18 's north - west and in three @entity20 suburbs			2
it appears the @entity10 page is run by members of the @entity6 community who have reacted to the counter-terror raids and fear for innocent @entity38 people who face mistreatment in @entity11			1
the page calls on @entity51 to safely air reports of discrimination			1
' please take time to send us reports of any islamophobic incidents either by submitting a private message via this page or by sending us an email to @entity61			0
' it publicly shares reports made by @entity10 users			0
the page describes seven incidents of ' @entity3 ' which include women dressed in hijabs verbally abused in the streets of @entity18 , a woman claiming a man tried to run her over as she crossed the road , and a senior cleric and member of the @entity75 detained for over two and a half hours at @entity76			1
the page also claims it has received hate mail , reinforcing the need for the forum 's existence			0
the @entity10 page provides information for victims of ' @entity3 ' seeking legal information to date , we have had reports of : - a mosque being defaced in @entity89 - a senior cleric and member of the @entity75 detained for over 2.5 hours at @entity76 without having his flight re-booked or reimbursed for costs incurred - direct threats issued against the @entity95 of @entity11 , @entity96 and @entity97 from anonymous members of the @entity11 @entity99 - women in hijab verbally abused in the streets of @entity18 , at shopping centres and whilst driving - one woman in particular claimed that a man almost ran her over as she tried to cross a school crossing outside her daughter 's school in the @entity109 of @entity18 - countless examples of social media vitriol targeting @entity51 the page has unfortunately also attracted a lot of hate mail , bigotry and vitriol which perhaps ironically proves why such a register is required in the first place			1
victims of ' @entity3 ' are provided with support information that is posted to the page			2
it offers contact details for counselling and free legal consultations			0
' were you directly or indirectly affected by the current issues affecting our community , or even feeling overwhelmed by it all ? ' mission of @entity134 's crisis intervention centre at @entity135 is hosting a @entity136 / families affected by the current police raids in our community , ' a post on the page reads			1
the page has only existed for six days but has already attracted over 1,500 followers			0
@entity140 contacted the ' @entity9 ' for comment			0
@entity10 user @entity142 responded to @entity140 's comment on the page expressing backlash against the purpose of the page			1
he believes the page is biased and deletes comments made by @entity41 who have been threatened by @entity51			0
' you should be asking them why they have taken down the posts of people that have had muslims threatening them in the streets			0
' can we come to your legal service and get advice from you when they have threatened other people for no reason other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time ? ' can the lady from yesterday get advice about the @entity6 lady making a throat slitting gesture towards her for no reason ? ' , mr @entity142 posted on sunday			2
but four hours before mr @entity142 's comment , @entity10 page posted a comment insisting ' all unrelated posts that include profanities and / or are offensive will be deleted from the page '			2
to submit a report to the @entity10 page a person must provide their full name , street address , email address and phone number			2
@entity184 ( pictured ) has been charged with a serious terrorism related offence and allegedly plotted to behead a member of the public in @entity189 a large sword was seized as part of the evidence found at a home in the suburb of @entity195 , in @entity18 @entity196 appeared on the @entity197 to say that further raids could be planned on homes across the country			0
