the hearing was told that both brothers had taken the drug on separate occasions			2
the pair watched as @entity30 won their match against @entity32 3 - 0 , and father @entity67 said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together			2
he said : ' they were brothers so they had fallings out but on the whole they got on as best friends			2
' they wanted to go and watch @entity30 play @entity74			2
i booked the tickets and sent them over with two football shirts for them			2
' it was the first time they had ever done anything together like this			0
they did n't know anybody in @entity9			1
they were looking forward to seeing each other			0
' my wife and i were happier than we had been for weeks and months and years			0
' landlord @entity89 later saw them in the bar and when asked whether they appeared to be drunk , he said they were ' on something else '			0
detective inspector @entity95 from @entity96 said @entity97 from a local shop caught them buying two bottles of @entity101 and a packet of chewing gum which they took back to their hotel			0
the alcohol was never consumed			0
@entity6 was the last to be seen when he came down from their room at around 9.30pm to ask for the pub 's @entity111 password			1
both of the boys ' bodies were found on monday morning , when pub worker @entity116 went to clean the room they had been staying in			1
@entity15 was told that @entity7 , along with his brother @entity6 , had both consumed the drug before on separate occasions ( pictured , @entity7 alongside an unknown friend ) the court heard that @entity6 ( pictured left , with a friend ) bought the drugs via website @entity42 which can not be accessed through regular websites , before travelling to @entity9 to meet his brother mr @entity116 told the inquest : ' i went into room five and saw one of the males on the floor in the room			1
at that stage i did n't see the other one			0
' my colleague went into the room and found the body of the other male in this was on the far side of the bed that would have been hidden from view			2
@entity148 , the boys ' father , said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together , and even bought shirts for the pair ' i was asked to check by police whether there was any evidence of tablets or drugs or anything untoward and i did n't see anything			1
' a post mortem on @entity7 body found he had 6.15mg of @entity11 per litre of blood in his body - almost six times the ' lethal ' amount of 1.7mg			1
he also had 229mg of alcohol in his blood - almost three times the drink drive limit			0
his brother @entity6 was found to have 7.08mg of ecstasy in his body , while his blood alcohol levels were lower at 87mg			1
@entity171 dr @entity170 told the inquest : ' if a person is not used it on a regular basis the impact may be greater			0
in batches of any drug there are different levels of toxicity			0
' they could have taken the same amount but the concentration could have been different			0
i would anticipate they took the same amounts each			0
' recording a narrative verdict , mr @entity14 said : ' they had a great day which makes the tragedy of these deaths even harder to accept			0
' there was concern as to the quality and quantity of ecstasy in terms of concentration and that may well have been a factor in terms of the ultimate impact			2
' they were likely to be tablet form but when they were taken and where taken is unknown			0
@entity11 is known as ecstasy and i accept there were sufficient quantities in the blood to cause death			2
' he added : ' i accept the drugs were obtained by use of the internet and the drugs delivered to him from an unknown source by use of the internet on the dark web			1
' i am concerned about the ability of young people to obtain elicit substances using the internet			0
' i am well aware that is a global problem and little can be done to avoid this supply line being used			0
the death of @entity7 and @entity6 identify a great problem - the dark web			1
recording a narrative verdict , mr @entity14 said the issue of the dark web concerned him ' as a father and a grandfather ' ( pictured , @entity6 ) ' the dark web identified an anonymous supplier and the supplier exists behind the veil - a confidential and sophisticated veil			1
' in the case of @entity7 and @entity6 i hear reference to @entity45 and reference to @entity42			1
i believe these matter should be reported to the home secretary			0
' young people have a natural ability these days with regard interned who find it much easier to access these dark sites and have available to them supply of drugs by simply ordering on the internet and delivering to address			2
' as a father and grandfather it is a frightening prospect			0
