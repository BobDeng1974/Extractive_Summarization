@entity0 believes sunday 's @entity1 will be close no matter how strongly - fancied @entity2 are			1
@entity2 are 1/8 with some bookmakers to reach the @entity5 final at the expense of @entity7			1
rangers are in turmoil on and off the pitch with a major cash shortfall being accompanied by uncertainty over the manager 's situation after @entity15 and then caretaker boss @entity16 handed in their notices			2
@entity0 ( centre ) scores a penalty against @entity7 during his time as a @entity2 player @entity0 ( left ) believes that the weekend 's clash between @entity2 and @entity7 will be a close encounter rangers trail @entity26 leaders hearts by 13 points while @entity2 have scored eight goals without reply in three games in 2015 , but @entity0 does not think form will have too much of an impact at @entity33 on sunday			1
' it 's always been relatively close , ' the former @entity2 player and manager said			1
' but irrespective of your position in the league , or how you 've been playing , or off the pitch , it wo n't make any difference			0
it 's just what happens on the day that 's going to decide who 's going to win			2
' i think it will be close , it will be really competitive			2
if it 's @entity2 , people will be saying they do n't want to go in there complacent			1
if it 's @entity7 , they will be trying to say they 've nothing to lose			1
' how can you ever go into an @entity1 game saying you 've nothing to lose ? everybody has got something to lose			2
it wo n't be a foregone conclusion			0
it ca n't be taken as given that anybody is going to win			0
' and if they need any example of that then they just need to look at the cup ties that were played over the weekend in @entity70			0
there were a few shocks there and there 's no way you would have tipped @entity77 to lose four goals			2
' the last @entity1 fixture was in april 2012 with the @entity82 club 's liquidation soon preventing the blue and green sides of the city meeting again until this weekend			2
and @entity0 feels their reunion is long overdue			1
@entity0 will be hoping @entity88 's side will emerge triumphant in the clash against @entity7 ' it 's something both @entity2 and @entity7 fans have missed out on in the last three years , an @entity1 , ' said @entity0 , who was promoting the fixture for @entity93			1
' it 's great to have it back in the calendar and it will be a huge occasion			0
' it takes away a lot from the conversations about what 's been going on at @entity82 and @entity2 will be up for it as well so i think it 's something that everybody will be looking forward to			1
' everybody misses the @entity1 games			0
maybe the only clubs that have n't suffered are @entity109 and @entity110 - when they get their derbies they get full houses			0
they are maybe not missing @entity7 being in the @entity114 but i think everyone else is			1
' @entity0 knew all about the rivalry having been brought up in the shadow of @entity82 as a @entity7 fan before turning out in the green and white			1
and he has warned the many players making their derby debuts on sunday that little can prepare them for what is in store			0
a 20 - year - old @entity0 overcame his nerves to score from the spot on his @entity1 debut - a 2 - 0 @entity5 win at @entity126 in august 1971			1
' the most memorable one for me was the first one			0
we got a penalty kick and @entity131 told me to take it ... it was a bad idea , ' he said			0
' i remember winning 2 - 0 but i do n't remember much else			0
@entity2 will play @entity7 at @entity33 , with the winner advancing into the @entity5 final ' you know what it 's about - you are born and brought up in the city			1
you know what the game is all about , you know what it means to everybody			0
' and , by the way , if it does n't mean as much to the people on the pitch as it does to the ones off it - then the ones on the pitch are going to have a hard time			0
' people can stand and talk to you for 20 minutes and explain something to you , but until you actually experience it yourself it 's hard to put it into perspective			0

@entity2 take on @entity7 in sunday 's @entity5 *semi-final*
@entity0 believes the game will be a close game between the two
but @entity2 are *overwhelming* favourites to reach the final
