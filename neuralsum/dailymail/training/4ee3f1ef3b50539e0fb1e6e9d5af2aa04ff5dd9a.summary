by @entity0 published : 23:22 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 23:30 est , 9 march 2013 a @entity2 - born author has given a frank description of her foreign exchange to @entity5 as a teenager - and her host family 's penchant for ' jiggling , dangling ' naked basketball			1
@entity9 says the @entity11 - based teacher and engineer she was sent to stay with for three months in 1984 , and their teenage son and daughter , seemed normal at first			1
until she discovered they were all very active members of a group called ' @entity18 ' - a nearby nudist club - and her joining them on their weekend jaunts was non-negotiable			1
nudists : @entity9 , pictured , has given a frank description of her foreign - exchange to @entity5 as a teenager ' the nudist outings were going to be pretty much mandatory , my hosts explained to me — much like speaking the language or eating the food , ' @entity9 wrote in an article in @entity30			1
' the family felt strongly that , to properly explore their native ways , i needed to join in the nudist activities			1
' after a few hours of convincing , she says ' i shrugged my shoulders , suppressed my panic and acquiesced			0
' the nudist camp consisted of a lake , grassy fields covered in goose and duck droppings and a few trees			2
and hundreds of naked @entity5 , who more than anything were there to top up their tans , she recalled			2
once she got the hang of the rules - do n't ogle people below the neck mid-conversation ( though sneaking a peak after is fine ) - she relaxed			1
and then they started playing basketball			0
tanning : the nudist camp consisted of a lake , grassy fields and hundreds of naked @entity5 , who more than anything were there to top up their tans ( stock photo ) ' we wore nothing but sneakers , ' she wrote in the article			2
' no brassieres , no jockstraps			0
there was flopping , and there was pain			0
there was the sight of nude people , bouncing and swinging above bulky white athletic shoes			0
' could this be the wonder my @entity5 family had talked about , the beauty of the unclad human form ? was this jiggling , dangling dance with a large , orange ball indeed our highest , purest identity ? ' but despite the bare ball games , @entity9 says she looks back on her forced @entity18 experience fondly			1
' in the end , the @entity5 were absolutely right , ' she wrote in the newspaper			0
' @entity93 gave me a gift i might never have received had i refused to play along			0
it left me with an acute sense of the absurd — one i still cherish — to be there among my fellow apes , awkward and less than half - willing , aiming and missing , leaping , landing and wincing			0

her joining them on their weekend jaunts during her 1984 stay was non-negotiable
she describes the club rules , which *include* not ogling below the neck mid-conversation , and the horror that is naked basketball
