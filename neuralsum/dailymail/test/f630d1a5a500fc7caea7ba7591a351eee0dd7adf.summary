@entity0 has told the @entity1 they must hold bungling officials to account			1
the former @entity4 striker has branded additional official @entity10 ' idiotic ' for failing to see a handball by @entity7 defender @entity6 in sunday 's @entity8 semi-final			1
@entity6 is now fighting a ban from the @entity12 following a notice of @entity14 from the @entity1 compliance officer			1

' there 's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that , ' he insisted			0
' it was just an absolute shocker			0
i just ca n't work out what he was thinking			0
' it was just idiotic how he did n't see it			0
it was n't a conspiracy , i just ca n't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close			0
' there is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head , he must be an idiot not to see it			0
' a goal ahead at the time , @entity4 reacted to ' supporter pressure ' by writing to the @entity1 seeking clarification on the failure of referee @entity58 to award a penalty and send @entity6 off			1
@entity28 infamously triggered a huge row in 2003 when he accused @entity62 of ' lying down ' to @entity63 to pip @entity4 to the title on the final day			2
insisting sunday was a question of incompetence rather than integrity , however , he added : ' it 's not a conspiracy , it 's just a rubbish and inept decision			0
' it should n't happen and it does n't reflect well on the @entity75 game if decisions like that are made			2
' i do n't know if maybe he ( @entity10 ) panicked , but he has a job to do and if he is not up to the job — which he clearly was n't — then he should n't do it again			0
' you can understand the frustration of the @entity4 fans and players and the manager 's frustration			2
' i 'm not saying that changes the perception of what @entity92 has done			0
as the season has gone on @entity4 have got stronger — but you have to say it 's a chance to win a @entity97 missed due to not just a poor decision , but an awful one			1

' the @entity1 will write back and just say he did n't see , ' he continued			2
' you know what 's going to happen and it 's a waste of a stamp			0
' i think @entity4 will be harbouring grudges for quite some time — and quite rightly so			2
' @entity121 added : ' i ca n't fathom out what @entity4 are going to gain by writing a letter to the @entity1			1
' @entity4 pair @entity21 ( left ) and @entity125 ( right ) look dejected following their semi-final defeat by @entity7			1
