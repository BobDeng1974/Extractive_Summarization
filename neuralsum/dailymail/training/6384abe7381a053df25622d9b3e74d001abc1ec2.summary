if you 're diligent about sticking to low calorie foods believing it 's a healthy option and wondering why you still ca n't still those stubborn pounds - then here 's some news that 's not sweet to swallow			1
by consuming fruity muesli and low - fat yoghurt you may think you are following a diet that will make you trim - but in fact you 're consuming more sugar than found in a chocolate bar or fizzy drink			1
the @entity12 recommend about 70g of sugar a day for men and 50g for women but many of us our exceeding this			1
our high sugar intake contributes to health problems including tooth decay and obesity - with being overweight causing a host of health problems including type - 2 diabetes and heart disease			1
not such a healthy breakfast : fruity muesli and orange juice is high in sugar the @entity32 say sugar is not ' bad ' for us to have in our diet , rather it is bad too have too much of it , they state : ' @entity38 , like starch , is a carbohydrate			1
there are many different types of , and names for sugar			1
for example , sucrose or ' table sugar ' is added to drinks , baked goods and confectionery			1
' fructose is naturally found in fruit and honey and lactose is naturally present in milk			0
glucose is also the type of sugar that circulates in the blood , often referred to as ' blood sugar ' or ' blood glucose ' , and provides the body with energy			1
' not so sweet side effects : too much sugar can lead to obesity and tooth decay they add : ' a moderate amount of sugar can be eaten as part of a healthy balanced diet			1
there are many different types of sugar , and it is the amount and how frequently you eat sugar that matters			1
eating too much of any food ( calories ) can cause weight gain			0
check labels for sugar contents , watch your portion sizes and try alternatives where possible ' health coach , @entity86 , 27 , a self - confessed former sugar addict , discovered that a large part of the problem is people - including dieters - consuming ' hidden ' sugars when they believe they are eating healthily			1
she told @entity92 : ' lots of manufactured ' diet ' and ' low fat ' products have hidden sugars that dieters should be aware of			1
low calorie yoghurts , salad dressings and ' healthy cereal ' based products are the most common culprits			1
tomato based sauces and soups can also be surprisingly high in sugar			2
even fajita mix packets can pack in more than you ’d expect			0
' @entity86 found low fat yoghurts in particular were actually a guilty pleasure in her diet and not a healthy dessert			2
for example , while a strawberry yoghurt may contain little or no fat , it 's high in sugar due to flavourings , colourings and natural sugars in fruit should it contain fruit pieces			1
an @entity125 yoghurt is just 2 per cent fat but has 17g of sugar - a third of a woman 's recommended daily sugar intake			2
@entity86 , who now mentors people on how to live sugar - free via her blog happysugarhabits.com , said natural or @entity133 yoghurt is a healthier alternative			2
she said one way people can try and reduce the amount of sugar in their daily diet is by avoiding sweet foods at breakfast			2
' start the morning off with savoury breakfasts instead of sweet to set the right intention for the day , ' she said			2
know what you 're eating : check labels for nutritional content and eat fresh where possible however , for many this will mean ditching the breakfasts we thought were a healthy start to the day			1
while muesli and a glass of orange juice may seem good for you , it 's actually laden with sugar			2
@entity86 explains : ' muesli , especially ones that are labelled ' at least 50 per cent ' fruit should be avoided			0
the fruit is of the dried variety and a very concentrated source of sugar that starts you off first thing with enough sugar for the whole day			1
' it would be much better to buy a low fruit muesli or make up a zero sugar version ( oats , nuts and seeds ) and then add some fresh blueberries instead			2
' on the subject of orange juice , while it 's high in vitamins , it 's also high in sugar so @entity86 recommends getting vitamin c from other food sources			0
step away from the cake ! follow @entity86 's advice for a sugar - free life she said : ' the fibre is removed from orange juice so you can glug down lots of sugar very quickly and easily			0
you can get vitamin c from lots of other sources if you ’re eating lots of salad and vegetables			0
' if you do have orange juice , @entity86 recommends freshly squeezed as a better alternative to a glass from a processed carton			0
when it comes to snacking on fruit , @entity86 said this can also be a sugar trap for the unsuspecting dieter due to the fructose content			0
she said : ' fruit needs to be moderated in line with your sugar related goals			0
i have eaten different amounts of fruit throughout my low sugar journey depending on how i ’ve felt at the time and the extent of my cravings			0
' of course , people should be getting their five - a - day ( preferably seven ) , but if you can make more of these vegetables instead of fruit , you ’re helping your tastebuds become more sensitive to the sweet taste and will start to appreciate fruit as the only sweet you really need			0
' for a period of time i did limit fruit and opted for only low fructose fruits ( e.g berries , kiwi fruit ) and avoided those that were higher in sugar ( bananas , mangos , dates )			0
' @entity86 said she has seen improvements in her sleep , energy and skin - as well as staying slim - thanks to cutting sugar out of her diet			0
while she realises it can be difficult for people to go ' cold turkey ' just reducing the amount of sugar in your diet - if that means being aware of the hidden sugars to could be consuming - can make a big difference to your health			1
a 150g serving of @entity257 yoghurt , left , contains 18.1g of sugar , more than a can of @entity260 that has 15.9g			0
instead have total 0 % fat yoghurt with 4g sugar per 100g @entity263 and @entity264 , left , per 45g serving with 125ml semi-skimmed milk has 23.4g sugar - more than a @entity268 's @entity267 that has 17.7g			0
instead go for @entity264 without dried fruit and add your own fresh fruit a bottle of @entity273 , left has 7.5g sugar , slightly more than a small @entity276 cappuccino with 7g sugar			0
instead , stick to mineral or tap water			0

@entity12 recommend 70g of sugar a day for men and 50g for women
many of us are exceeding this *risking* tooth decay and obesity
part of problem is ' hidden sugars ' consumed in ' healthy ' products
