after suffering four devastating miscarriages , @entity1 and @entity2 resigned themselves to the fact they would never have a child together			1
but they are now preparing to celebrate their first @entity8 as a very extended family , after @entity10 , 32 , miraculously gave birth to quadruplets			1
the couple , from @entity14 , @entity15 , spend four years trying to have children and tragically suffered four miscarriages			2
they had suffered such heartache with each miscarriage they decided not to put themselves through @entity24 treatment , and gave up their dream of having a baby together			1
it was then that , incredibly , the couple received the news that mrs @entity10 had become pregnant completely naturally			1
what came next was even more of a shock : she was pregnant with quadruplets			2
@entity34 , 32 , had suffered four miscarriages which had left her heartbroken			1
but soon afterwards she found out she was pregnant - with quadruplets			2
she gave birth to @entity36 ( left , dressed as a reindeer ) , @entity38 ( second from left , dressed as @entity39 ) , @entity1 may ( second from right , dressed as a @entity39 in stripy trousers ) and @entity41 ( right , dressed as an elf ) mr and mrs @entity10 had given up on having children after the miscarriages , and had even turned down @entity24 treatment in case it did n't work			1
now , they are looking forward to their first @entity8 with their new family the babies were born by caesarean section when mrs @entity10 was 32 weeks pregnant			1
one daughter , @entity53 , was born with a congenital defect , but luckily was big enough to survive the surgery she needed doctors said the story really is a miracle , as the chances of conceiving quadruplets naturally is around one in 10,000			1
now , @entity43 and mrs @entity10 are looking forward to celebrating their first @entity8 together with their now seven - month - old babies			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' we call them our fantastic four			1
we can not believe our babies are seven months old now - time flies and we are so looking forward to their first @entity8			2
' friends and family have been showering them with presents already - they have a @entity73 which they love and helps to calm them down			0
' ' the babies are our @entity8 miracles - we are blessed			2
' just when we thought we could n't go through any more and we were ready to give up , we received the best news ever			2
' i really want to encourage other women to keep trying , because if we 'd given up we would n't have the babies we do now			0
' miss @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 at @entity84 in @entity85 and @entity86 @entity87 , said the chances of conceiving quadruplets is ‘ extremely rare ’ she told @entity90 : ‘ if it ’s totally spontaneous , the incidence of natural quadruplets is one in 10,000			0
’ she added that @entity43 and mrs @entity10 ’s story should give hope to others who have had miscarriages in the past			1
she said : ‘ many people who have recurrent miscarriages , there is no reason why			0
doctors ca n’t find a reason why			0
‘ there is a huge miscarriage service in central @entity85			0
one of the most important things it does to help these women give support and care			0
‘ someone needs to help them keep going , not to give up , because they will get there eventually			0
’ ‘ this is what happened to this couple - they had a bad run but then they got their stroke of luck			0
’ however , she warned giving birth to quadruplets does come with some increased health risks for mother and baby			2
‘ multiple pregnancies increase the risk of developing high blood pressure			0
the mother will need to have @entity133 , which is a major surgery			0
‘ the babies come a lot earlier , they will need neonatal help			0
' but in the @entity141 if a woman gets to 32 weeks and the babies are well grown , there is a 97 per cent chance they will survive			1
' the couple 's daughters @entity41 , @entity36 , @entity1 may , and son , @entity38 will enjoy their first experience of sitting by the christmas tree and opening presents , as their parents are kept busy looking after them			2
mrs @entity10 said : ' we are going to my parents for @entity8 dinner so we can actually all sit down and enjoy it			1
' otherwise , @entity38 and i would be so busy with all the babies we would probably end up having @entity8 dinner really late , in front of the tv			2
' we want this @entity8 to be magical - as we are so grateful to have all of our babies with us			2
' and one of their daughters , @entity53 , is a double miracle			2
she was born with a birth defect and her parents were told she would only last a few hours after being born			2
@entity53 was diagnosed with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia - a hole in the diaphragm that allows the contents of the abdomen to move into the chest cavity and the organs to move into the wrong place			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' we were told if @entity53 was born too small , no surgeon would operate on her and due to her hernia , her heart was in the wrong place and lungs were n't properly developed			1
' thankfully , at 4lbs 3oz , @entity53 was the biggest of the bunch and she had life - saving surgery as soon as she was born			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' we are so thankful to the @entity181 for saving our little girl 's life			1
' she has regular check - ups but has been a little fighter from the word go - she bit the doctor in the hospital ! ' mr and mrs @entity10 still remember how they had almost given up hope of having the family they always dreamed of			1
even when they were told she was pregnant , they remained cynical because of the four previous miscarriages they 'd suffered			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' when we went for the babies ' first scan we thought we 'd lost another baby			1
' but we were given amazing news that we were definitely pregnant , everything was well and we were actually having quads			0
' we left with mixed emotions as we were essentially told not to hold our breath , as quads usually do n't survive			0
' the couple were told to not get their hopes up at every appointment for the next 26 weeks			0
the babies were finally born the day before mrs @entity10 was due to have a c - section at 32 weeks and six days			1
@entity41 was the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz ( right ) , and @entity36 was the smallest weighing 2lbs 15oz ( second from right )			0
their brother @entity38 was born weighing 3lbs 10oz ( left ) and sister @entity217 weighed 3lbs 4oz ( second from left ) the quads , who were born in may this year , get through 35 nappies a day , their mother said @entity41 was the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz , and @entity36 was the smallest weighing 2lbs 15oz			0
their brother @entity38 was born weighing 3lbs 10oz and sister @entity217 weighed 3lbs 4oz			0
mrs @entity10 said : ' we are so glad our babies survived			1
we are delighted with our four healthy and happy little miracles			0
i never let myself dream this could happen			0
' the quads , who were born in may this year , get through 35 nappies a day and certainly have childminder @entity1 and insulation consultant @entity38 rushed off their feet			0
mrs @entity10 said : ' the babies are eating three meals a day now plus two bottles and are certainly keeping us busy			1
i worked as a child minder for years but nothing could have prepared me for this			0
' it 's hard work but it is so worth it to see our healthy , happy children			0
' i ca n't wait to see their faces when they open their @entity252 teddies on christmas day - they are mad for @entity254			0
' ' i ca n't wait to see their faces when they open their @entity252 teddies on christmas day - they are mad for @entity254 , ' mrs @entity10 says			1
