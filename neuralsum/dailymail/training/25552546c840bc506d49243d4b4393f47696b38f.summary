by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here for our live scorecard after @entity7 v @entity5 's second day at @entity8 the cry has been for positive , proactive cricket at the start of this new @entity13 era and @entity7 responded , at least with the bat , by frolicking in the @entity16 ’s sunshine yesterday to rattle along to their highest score against @entity5			1
there will rarely be better conditions than this but a team who had forgotten how to score 300 , let alone build match - defining totals , made hay while the sun shone with a formidable 575 for nine			2
it means realistically there can only be one winner of this first @entity31			0
@entity32 set out his stall by making it clear here that winning will not be enough for @entity37 ’s side			0
it must be done with style			0
best : @entity40 helped @entity7 secure an excellent opening innings against @entity5 at @entity8 top : @entity40 celebrates after reaching a double century of 200 runs not out during the second day 's play at @entity8 ‘ we want a team that followers are proud of and want to identify with , ’ said managing director @entity32 in the first @entity31 programme			1
‘ we have to earn that right by playing pro-active cricket			0
we want to play winning but positive cricket			0
’ so far , so good then , with @entity40 reaching an unbeaten double hundred of some maturity on the second day of the test summer and @entity7 scoring their runs at such a rate that @entity37 was able to declare well before tea			1
@entity5 ensured it was not all plain sailing for @entity7 by then enjoying one of @entity62 ’s perfect pitches themselves but , at 140 for one , they have much to do if they are to travel to @entity64 with this mini-series still all square			1
@entity40 acknowledges the crowd after @entity7 's opening innings on 200 runs not out during the second day 's play it was a reverse - swept four from , of all people , @entity72 that took @entity7 beyond the 551 for six they amassed here eight years ago against @entity5			1
the fact that @entity7 were unable to force a win in that 2006 game , with @entity77 bowling himself into the ground , shows there could be three long days ahead			2
yet , a side who were humiliated by @entity82 will be happy enough that they passed the first examination of their batting mix of old and new with a spring in their step			0
none more so than @entity40 , who added another hundred to the one he scored on thursday to become , at 23 , the fourth youngest @entity91 to record a double century in test cricket			1
debut : @entity94 bowls during @entity7 's second day against @entity5 at @entity8 time to celebrate : @entity94 looks as overjoyed as @entity40 did during @entity7 's opening innings high fives : @entity94 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity98 in his very first over @entity7 sprang a surprise by asking @entity100 to bat at @entity102 here and dropped @entity40 to no 5 , where he had made his maiden test hundred against @entity105 on his @entity107 home ground last summer			1
@entity40 looked immediately at home back in the middle order , filling the anchor role vacated by @entity111 and showing that @entity7 will not have to rely totally on @entity37 and @entity112 to provide the right example for their callow colleagues			1
@entity40 was able to scamper along at a steady pace thanks to the support he received , even after @entity117 and then @entity94 had fallen to @entity5 ’s fastest bowler in @entity119 and their very own ‘ @entity122 ’ tactics			1
the short ball may have done the trick for @entity5 but it had little effect as the second day wore on , with @entity126 , who last week declared his intention to attack with the bat , flaying a tiring attack that became increasingly ragged			1
dive : @entity131 , who past his half - century , avoids @entity94 's bouncer at @entity8 by the time @entity126 had smacked 47 from 38 balls and @entity134 , surely @entity7 ’s best no 10 in years , had added 39 , @entity5 were looking as woeful here as @entity7 had appeared in the field at @entity137 in the final @entity138			1
even after scoring 575 in 130 overs there were some voices in the commentary box claiming @entity7 could have been less conservative , yet they can hardly have done more to fulfil @entity32 ’s mission statement when @entity37 declared after @entity40 had reached his landmark			1
the last time @entity40 batted at @entity16 ’s he had scored 180 against @entity82 and this monumental effort came just a day after his brother @entity146 scored a double century of his own for @entity148 against @entity149			2
a good week then for this impressive cricketing family from @entity151			0
it was always going to be harder against @entity5 ’s batsmen than bowlers but @entity7 did not get much luck			2
@entity98 was given out lbw to @entity72 by @entity156 in the first over but technology , incredibly , insisted the ball would have gone over the stumps			2
then prior appeared to catch @entity131 on 39 but the umpires abdicated responsibility and , after an eternity , tv official @entity163 could not be sure the ball carried			0
but prior insisted : ‘ i felt it carry			0
‘ my gloves have got rubber tips in them , and i felt the ball go right in			0
there ’s no doubt in my mind that it did carry			0
i ’m disappointed the decision did n’t stand but that ’s cricket and we move on			0
’ just as unsatisfactory was the fact that six overs remained unbowled at the close even after a half - hour extension , an unacceptable rate with @entity5 the principal offenders			2
at least there was one positive moment in the field for @entity7 when @entity94 took the only wicket to fall with his third ball in test cricket and celebrated as joyously as @entity40 had enjoyed his hundreds			1
new era and two positive , proactive stars for the here and now in @entity40 and @entity192			0
@entity7 can be satisfied with that , even if they struggle to win here .			0

@entity7 declare 575 for 9 from 130.3 overs
@entity40 gets 200no while debutant @entity94 bowls opener @entity98 out in his first over with his third ball in test cricket
day two ends with @entity5 on 140 - 1
