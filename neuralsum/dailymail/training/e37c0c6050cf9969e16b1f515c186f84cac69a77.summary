by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 07:22 est , 7 june 2013 the hassle and embarrassment of wrestling with a wind - blown umbrella could now be a thing of the past , thanks to a hemlet - style head protector			1
the @entity9 's canopy protects users from the wind and rain without obstructing their view and during tests in gale force seven - around 40mph - winds the umbrella did n't once blow inside out			1
it was designed by @entity19 - based company @entity18 and has been designed not to drip on other people or poke passers - by in the face			1
it is based on the design of a motorcycle helmet and its fibre - glass ribs and polyester canopy means it wo n't blow inside out , drip on other people or poke passers - by in the face the @entity30 is based on the traditional motor helmet			1
it folds up and is secured by a cleverly concealed internal @entity44 strip and then fits into its handy shoulder carry case			0
the @entity30 has : ten @entity48 ribs @entity49 @entity50 @entity51 @entity52 height 90cm width 5cm ( when closed ) @entity54 65cm ( when open ) weight 0.5 kg entrepreneur @entity27 , 48 , who owns @entity18 , came up with the idea during last year ’s wet and windy @entity57			2
he wanted to design an umbrella that could be used specifically for watching sporting events in a crowd			2
the @entity30 has a cut - away front , which was based on the design of a motorbike helmet			0
this means people can see out the front of the @entity9 while protecting their head and shoulders from the wind and rain			1
it 's design also means it does n't obstruct the view of people standing nearby , or drip onto their shoulders			1
the @entity30 can also be used to protect users from the sun. @entity27 said : ' it was pouring with rain , the wind was howling and i was struggling with my umbrella			1
' i thought there had to be a better way			0
' traditional umbrellas have a lot of drawbacks in busy environments as they can blow inside out and make it difficult to navigate through crowds			0
' the basic design of the umbrella has n’t changed for centuries , so the time is ripe for to make it more suitable to modern settings			0
' ' i came up with a classic motorcycle helmet shape that is shaped like a dome so it does n't stick out and there is no longer the fear of poking somebody in the eye			0
' anyone with a normal umbrella has to lift it over their head to see where they are going but the front of the @entity9 is opened up			2
@entity27 worked with @entity110 on his @entity30 umbrella			0
he then tested the design in a wind tunnel at @entity114 , pictured			0
the @entity9 was subjected to winds up to 40mph and did n't break , rip , or turn inside out ' because it is slender , it is also more resistant to the wind than a normal umbrella			1
' we tested ours out in a wind tunnel at 40mph and it still kept its shape whereas the regular one had popped inside out			2
' @entity27 got help from designers and product developers at the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) at @entity110			0
he then tested the design using a wind tunnel at @entity114			0
the customisable @entity30 costs £ 24.99 and was specifically designed to be used in a crowd at sporting events or large outside gatherings			1
the caonpy completely covers the user 's head and shoulders without dripping water on people stood nearby			0
it does n't have the traditional ' spikes ' of other umbrellas either , so does n't poke other people in the face , or obstruct their view not only did @entity27 test the @entity30 to see if it blew inside out , it also used the wind tunnel at @entity114 to see how much the model protected his face from the wind and the wind chill @entity27 tested a traditional umbrella in the tunnel , at wind speeds of gale force seven , and then tested the @entity9			1
while the traditional umbrella turned inside out almost immediately , the @entity9 was relatively unaffected - it did n't turn inside out and could be used to shield @entity27 's face from the wind			1
the @entity30 has ten spoke fibre - glass ribs covered by a customisable polyester canopy it comes with a black aluminium shaft and rubber grip handle			1
the canopy is 65cm wide when open and the whole umbrella weighs half a kilogram			2
the @entity30 is 90cm tall and can be folded up and put into shoulder carry case			0
it was funded by the @entity163 and the @entity110 's @entity164 and @entity165			0
the @entity30 costs £ 24.99 but the company insists it will last longer than traditional umbrellas			1
during wind tunnel tests at @entity169 also tested the traditional umbrella design			2
the umbrella turned inside out immediately when subjected to gale force winds			2
@entity27 came up with idea for the @entity30 after getting rained on at last year 's @entity57			0

@entity9 protects users from wind and rain without obstructing their view
it ca n't be blown inside out , does n't drip on others , and ca n't poke people in the face while *walking* down the street
