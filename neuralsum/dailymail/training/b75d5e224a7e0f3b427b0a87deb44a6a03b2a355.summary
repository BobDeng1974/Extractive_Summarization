' and i 've told you that in combat he 's at the same risk as any other @entity45 pilot			0
' clearly if we had a vip in theatre and frankly if i was there or , @entity59 , if you were there in @entity1 and there was a breach of the perimeter security , anybody who might , by nature of who they are , be a target , they would be put in a secure location			2

' for @entity97 to take measures to reduce the risk of these attacks being repeated is a very natural thing			2
