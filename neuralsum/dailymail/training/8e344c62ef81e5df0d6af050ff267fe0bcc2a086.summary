by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:49 est , 6 december 2013 a senior eurocrat attacked @entity4 yesterday for having a ‘ too generous ’ welfare system and insisted there will be no tightening of the rules on @entity10 immigration			1
@entity11 travelled to @entity12 to demand changes to the free movement directive that has allowed more than a million @entity15 to move to the @entity4 since 2004			0
in a combative intervention , the home secretary suggested the idea of a ‘ cap ’ on the number of @entity10 workers that @entity4 should be expected to take			1
but her pleas were immediately rejected by @entity10 justice commissioner @entity23 – who also vowed to block @entity4 ’s attempts to end ‘ benefit tourism ’			1
@entity10 justice commissioner @entity23 ( left ) rejected the pleas of @entity11 to ' cap ' the number of workers that @entity4 should be expected to take in a stinging response , mrs @entity23 said that only @entity4 was to blame for any abuse of its welfare system by migrants			1
she hit back : ‘ it seems that some national systems are too generous			1
do n’t blame the @entity38 or @entity10 rules for national choices and national regulatory systems			1
‘ if member states want to restrict the availability of social benefits to @entity10 citizens they can do two things			1
first , change their national systems to make them less generous			0
‘ second , apply the existing @entity10 rules which provide safeguards to counter abuse , fraud and error : for example possible expulsion orders and re-entry bans in case of abuses			1
’ mrs @entity23 ruled out any change to the @entity10 free movement rules – despite the pressure on @entity4 ministers to make changes ahead of the lifting of controls on @entity66 and @entity67 next month			1
‘ our @entity10 rules are good and they are here to stay			1
member states need to apply them to tackle abuse			0
’ upon her arrival at a meeting of @entity10 justice ministers in @entity12 yesterday , mrs may called for reform of free movement , a proposal with support in @entity81 , the @entity82 and @entity83			1
ministers were last night accused of running scared from a gathering @entity86 rebellion over the lifting of controls on @entity66 and @entity67 immigrants			0
some 63 @entity90 have signed an amendment to the government ’s @entity92 demanding that existing controls on workers from the two countries should not be lifted on january 1			0
however , in a move which provoked anger on the @entity86 backbenches , @entity100 yesterday ‘ delayed ’ debate on the legislation until the @entity103			2
by that time the migrants will already be allowed to work in the @entity4 and the rebel @entity86 amendment could no longer apply			0
@entity86 mp @entity106 said : ‘ it would surely make sense for the @entity109 to vote on whether to extend immigration restrictions for @entity67 and @entity66 in advance of them being lifted ? ’ @entity114 leader @entity113 accused the government of ‘ desperately trying to bury the news ’ by delaying the vote on the same day that @entity118 was focused on the @entity119			2
mr @entity120 insisted the overall progress of the @entity122 – which would make it easier to deport foreign criminals – would not be delayed			0
‘ it is simply that i have announced in the future business before @entity127 , progress on five @entity122			0
’ she said : ‘ for future accession treaties , we must be able to slow full access to each other ’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration			2
‘ this could , for example , be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed			0
second , looking ahead , we must seize the opportunity presented by the prime minister ’s plan to reform the @entity10 and address the problems caused by free movement			2
for example , why should n’t national governments be allowed to impose a cap on numbers if @entity154 immigration reaches certain thresholds ? ’ earlier this week , @entity156 , @entity66 ’s labour minister , said @entity4 should be grateful to @entity66 and @entity67 for taking jobs shunned by locals			2
ministers insist they are powerless to maintain existing restrictions on citizens from the two countries on january 1			0
instead , mrs may is now focusing on changing the rules in the long - term			0
@entity166 is expected to raise the idea of a cap on @entity10 migrants in future negotiations over the @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity10			1
n @entity66 and @entity67 have by far the highest poverty levels in @entity154 , said a report yesterday			0
half of @entity67 and 41.7 per cent of @entity66 qualify as poor , compared to a @entity154 average of about 25 per cent			0
the @entity10 ’s statistics arm @entity176 said more than four out of ten children in the two countries are also poor			2
some 44 per cent of @entity67 and 30 per cent of @entity66 are ‘ severely materially deprived ’			2
the @entity4 figu re is 7.8 per cent			0
