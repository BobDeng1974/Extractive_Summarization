by @entity0 separated by more than 50 years and an ocean of experience , they were the unlikeliest of bosom friends			1
he was a retired @entity7 priest — albeit a worldly one — and she was a wealthy , 21 - year - old @entity9 student who was soon to become the most glamorous woman in the world			1
and yet , from their first encounter during her visit to @entity16 in 1950 , @entity17 was ‘ enchanted ’ with father @entity18 , a 73 - year - old friend of a friend , as he chaperoned her around the city , taking her on a trip to the theatre and @entity16 ’s finest @entity24 restaurant			1
they were to meet only once more , but in an astonishing 14 - year correspondence , she poured out her hopes , fears and secrets to the old priest with a candour she admitted she never extended to anyone else			1
private letters : @entity17 pictured with father @entity18 in @entity16 , @entity7 , in 1950			1
they would only meet once more before he died in 1964 , but their 14 - year correspondence would shed fresh light on @entity17 's most private thoughts in 33 newly discovered handwritten letters , amounting to some 130 pages , the famously tight - lipped mrs @entity17 writes freely of her suspicions about @entity42 ’s fidelity , her reservations over his frightening ambition and her utter loneliness and anger at his tragic death			1
in correspondence before and after she joined her husband in the @entity50 , she admitted the rising political star was consumed by ambition ‘ like @entity54 ’			1
writing in 1953 — the year they married — she said that politicians were ‘ a breed apart ’ but admitted that she too was vulnerable to their craving for attention			1
‘ maybe i ’m just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and @entity63 — and not just a sad little housewife , ’ she told the priest			1
never seen before : @entity65 of @entity67 's @entity66 in @entity68 , @entity69 , says that the letters came from ' a private source ' ‘ that world can be very glamorous from the outside , but if you ’re in it — and you ’re lonely — it could be a @entity76			1
’ it may have taken decades for star - struck @entity9 to realise their revered president was a ruthless and vain womaniser , but his wife saw it even before she married him			1
in july 1952 , she had confided to @entity82 that : ‘ i think i ’m in love with			1
@entity42 — he ’s the son of the ambassador to @entity85			2
’ she continued : ‘ maybe it will end very happily — or maybe , since he ’s this old and set in his ways and cares so desperately about his career , he just wo n’t want to give up that much time to extracurricular things like marrying			2
’ she also admitted that she saw some of the characteristics of her own hard - drinking , gambling and womanising stockbrother father , @entity94 , in @entity42			2
@entity17 divorced her mother when @entity17 was just ten , and it is said he was so drunk at her wedding to @entity42 that her stepfather had to step in to escort her to the altar			2
young love : @entity42 and @entity17 pictured in the early days of their courtship			2
at this point , @entity17 was already writing to @entity0 , likening her future husband 's womanizing ways to those of her father @entity17 wrote : ‘ he ’s like my father in a way — loves the chase and is bored with the conquest — and once married needs proof he ’s still attractive , so flirts with other women and resents you , ’ she told @entity82 at the end of 1952			2
‘ i saw how that nearly killed @entity118			2
’ if @entity17 ever did ask her to marry him , she mused , ‘ it will be for rather practical reasons — because his career is this driving thing with him ’			2
she clearly managed to overcome her initial qualms , telling her priest friend in 1954 : ‘ i love being married much more than i did even in the beginning			1
’ if she was always forgiving of @entity94 , she was n’t always quite so kind about his family			2
father @entity0 clearly provided an outlet for her to whisper the things she dared not say out loud			2
she once wrote witheringly of her mother - in - law , rose : ‘ i do n’t think @entity94 ’s mother is too bright — and she would rather say a rosary than read a book			2
’ newlyweds : the couple married in 1953			2
a year later , @entity17 writes in a letter to @entity0 : ' i love being married much more than i did even in the beginning ' the treasure trove lay undisturbed for 50 years in a safe at the priest ’s former seminary , @entity142 , in @entity16 , until being discovered by chance by a visiting book valuation expert			1
made available to the @entity147 , they are expected to fetch at least £ 1 million when they go up for sale next month			1
@entity17 experts have been stunned by the haul			2
for while mrs @entity17 was privy to some of the most extraordinary years in @entity50 history , she refused to write a memoir or even give an interview in the last 30 years of her life			0
friends who betrayed her confidences were immediately ostracised			0
father @entity0 , it appears , may have been her only real confidant			0
‘ it ’s so good in a way to write all this down and get it off your chest — because i never do really talk about it with anyone , ’ she told him			0
she was even ready to criticise @entity168 to him after @entity42 ’s assassination in @entity170 in 1963 , revealing her anger at the @entity172 for taking away the man she loved just months after the death of a son [ @entity175 ] , who lived for only two days			0
shaken faith : @entity17 , pictured with her young children at @entity42 's funeral in november 1963 , shares her heartbreak with @entity0 , admitting that she had become ' bitter against @entity168 ' ‘ i am so bitter against @entity168 , ’ she wrote in early 1964 on a letter on black - bordered paper			1
soon , she wrote again , telling the now 86 - year - old priest : ‘ i feel more cruelly every day what i have lost — i always would have rather lost my life than lost @entity94			1
’ but she did n’t want to raise their children ‘ in a bitter way ’			0
she added : ‘ @entity168 will have a bit of explaining to do to me if i ever see him			0
’ but she would keep praying , she said sadly , as ‘ i have to think there is a @entity168 — or i have no hope of finding @entity94 again ’			0
it was one of her last letters to the priest , who died in the autumn of 1964			1
at his funeral , a bouquet of red roses lay on his coffin — sent by mrs @entity17			0
as one might have expected with a priest and a practising @entity204 , their correspondence had a religious aspect			1
father @entity0 sent her books about the lives of the saints and she admitted he had rekindled her interest in religion			0
in early 1952 , she wrote : ‘ i terribly want to be a good @entity204 now and i know it ’s all because of you			0
i suppose i realised in the back of my mind you wanted that — you gave me the rosary as i left @entity7			0
’ longstanding friendship : father @entity0 and @entity17 , pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting , corresponded faithfully over the course of 14 years she was so smitten with him that it got on @entity42 ’s nerves when the two friends met a second time , this time on a visit by the @entity226 to @entity16 in 1955			1
the couple and @entity82 were guests at a dinner hosted by @entity230 , son of the @entity7 prime minister and his glamorous wife @entity232			0
@entity17 recalled in a letter to the priest : ‘ our happy marriage was nearly rent asunder because @entity94 was enchanted with @entity232 , and i was enchanted with you — but somehow we patched it all up at the movies			1
’ in letters , she addressed him as ‘ @entity241 ’ , always signing off : ‘ @entity242 ’			1
that , she felt she had to explain to the man of @entity168 , meant ‘ hugs and kisses ’			0
one particularly effusive letter ended : ‘ bushels , barrels , carts & lorry loads of love to @entity253 — @entity254 ’			0
another finished with ‘ @entity256 ’			0
what was it about @entity82 that so captivated the young @entity9 ? the bon viveur and well - read cleric was certainly no ordinary @entity7 priest			1
he had spent much of his priesthood in @entity265 , teaching in a @entity204 teacher - training college in @entity267			0
@entity17 's men : sitting with @entity42 just before they married in 1953 during @entity269 , he served as a @entity271 chaplain on the @entity272 , an experience that left him partially deaf			0
in @entity265 , he moved in literary circles , counting playwright @entity275 among his friends			0
when he retired to @entity16 , he was often visited by friends of a wealthy @entity9 couple he had befriended in @entity265 — including mrs @entity17			1
biographers of @entity17 have never realised the importance of @entity82 to her			0
one biographer noted casually how she enjoyed the company of a priest who ‘ embraced a joyous form of @entity286 that saw no conflict between religious piety and enjoying the finer things in life ’			1
b ut as mrs @entity17 confided to @entity82 , he was someone who ‘ loves everything i love — who you can have fun with			0
whom you can talk to about anything in the world and know you wo n’t shock them ’			0
we may never know exactly what he thought of her because his letters have n’t been found , but we can surmise her high opinion of him was reciprocated , although she reveals how he also accused her of being fickle , calling her a ‘ girouette ’ , the @entity24 for weather - vane			1
perhaps he had in mind her revelation that she almost married someone else — a stockbroker named @entity309 — with whom she was so ‘ terribly much in love ’ in 1952			0
and yet within months , she was confiding that she had fallen for another man , @entity42 , and her engagement to @entity309 was swiftly ended			0
when @entity17 died in 1994 , obituarists noted with regret that she had remained largely a mystery by keeping so silent about her past			0
now , thanks to an unlikely but firm friendship , the curtain has been pulled back a little .			0

the letters were sent to @entity18 , a @entity322 priest in @entity16
they were written between 1950 and 1964
letters will be *auctioned* in @entity68 , @entity69 , on june 10
the *collective* *archive* is expected to fetch over *€* *1million*
