by @entity0 it ’s a procedure doctors have been using for a long time , but now it ’s finally been approved			2
@entity4 to treat wrinkles around the corners of the eyes – also known as ‘ crow ’s feet ’ - was officially sanctioned by the @entity9 on wednesday			1
@entity11 's feet are thought to be caused by repeated muscle contractions over a lifetime through facial expressions like frowning , smiling and squinting			1
' this additional indication will provide people with a new @entity9 approved treatment option for those seeking a smoother appearance by temporarily minimising the appearance of crow ’s feet at the sides of the eyes , ' said @entity24 , director of the @entity25 in the @entity9 ’s @entity26 , in the @entity9 statement			1
approved : @entity4 can now be legally applied to smooth wrinkles around the eyes signs of aging : @entity4 was first approved as a cosmetic in 2002 for temporary improvement of frown lines - the wrinkles between the eyebrows @entity4 has been used for decades by opthalmologists to treat eyelid twitching , or blepharospasm , according to dr. @entity40			1
the @entity42 - based aesthetic plastic surgeon , told @entity43 that this is one of the ways doctors discovered it could smooth the skin			0
while this new @entity9 approval for @entity4 only came wednesday , @entity53 said , ‘ doctors have been using it off - label for years to smooth the crow 's feet ’			1
the new @entity9 approval came following a study of 833 adults conducted by the drug 's manufacturer , @entity59 of @entity60 , @entity61 , where participants were randomly assigned to receive a @entity4 or a placebo injection			1
people treated with @entity4 had greater reductions in crow 's feet			1
a few celebrities have admitted to using @entity4 , including the likes of @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			2
@entity70 : ' i ’m totally not against plastic surgery			0
i ’ve tried @entity4 before			2
that ’s the only thing that i ’ve done			0
' @entity73 : ' i think that @entity4 is one of the best things that ’s ever been created for cosmetic surgery			2
' @entity4 ( @entity79 ) is a protein and neurotoxin and is the most acutely toxic substance known			2
however , when injected directly into a muscle in approved doses , @entity4 prevents muscles from tightening by temporarily paralysing them , which in turn makes wrinkles disappear – for up to six months			1
@entity4 was first approved as a cosmetic by the @entity9 in 2002 for temporary improvement of frown lines - the wrinkles between the eyebrows , also known as glabellar lines			1
the most common side effect seen was eyelid edema , which causes the eyelids to become swollen due to fluid buildup			0
@entity69 says she no longer uses @entity4 : ' i did n’t like how my face looked afterwards			2
now i do n’t use it anymore – i can move my forehead again			0
' @entity72 : ' i have a big crease between my eyebrows and i use @entity4 to get rid of that , but that ’s kind of it			0
i ’m 51 and i think i look my age , but i do n’t want to be 20 anymore or even 30 or 40 '			0
@entity71 : ' i 've had @entity4 , but then again pretty much everyone i know has			0
to me , @entity4 is no more unusual than toothpaste			0
you do it once a year , who cares ? ' botox labels contain the strongest warning the @entity9 offers saying the effects of the toxin may spread from the area of injection to other areas of the body			0
however the @entity9 said there has never been a confirmed serious case of this happening when @entity4 is used at recommended doses			0
according to dr @entity122 , a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity4 has been frequently used for crow 's feet and other unapproved areas of the face , like the side of the nose			1
the @entity9 's new approval ‘ does give you an added benefit and safety of saying that i 'm not doing anything illegal or potentially harmful ’ , he said to @entity43			0
botox for cosmetic purposes still likely wo n't be covered by insurers , given it is used for cosmetic purposes			1
insurers often cover people who have approved medical conditions treated by @entity4 , including chronic migraines , severe underarm sweating and others .			1
