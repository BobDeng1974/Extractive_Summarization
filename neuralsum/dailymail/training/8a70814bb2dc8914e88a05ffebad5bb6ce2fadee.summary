by @entity1 reporter published : 12:41 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 5 may 2013 the scales did not tip in favor of a man who was taking aerial video footage using a drone helicopter and lost his equipment to a rooftop statue of lady justice			1
the $ 1500 camera ‘ copped a feel of @entity17 ’s right breast ’ said owner @entity9 , before it found surer footing on the hilt of her sword			1
@entity9 , a freelance video producer , was taking unsolicited promotional footage for the city of @entity22 , @entity23 april 27 when the flying camera was caught in some wind			1
stuck : video producer @entity9 got his flying helicopter camera drone stuck in a rooftop statue in @entity22 , @entity23 last week it landed in one of the highest possible places , 100 feet up on the statue atop the @entity33			1
authorities were informed of the 7 - pound , 9 - inch remote – controlled drone the following monday , at which point a small controversy erupted in the north - central @entity23 town			1
days of grumbling about who was responsible for retrieving the device , how it could be done , and how much it would cost ensued			2
‘ it may sit up there for a long time because we are not spending county dollars , ’ commissioner @entity44 told the @entity45			2
‘ we ’d certainly like to have it down , without a doubt , but i do n’t think it ’s the public , their obligation to get it down			2
’ funny : @entity9 , pictured , joked that the piece of equipment ' copped a feel ' from @entity58 before lodging into the hilt of her sword high : the statue sits atop the @entity33 , @entity63 and looks out over @entity64 while @entity44 feared for the public ’s wallets , commissioner @entity65 feared for their safety			1
' in a worst case scenario , now , it could fall clear off the roof and hit something			2
and commissioner @entity75 was concerned about doing everything by the book and warned , ‘ he needs to check with the prosecutor and our insurance company with his plan for retrieving his helicopter before he does anything			2
’ even emergency workers threw their hands in the air			2
‘ i do n’t know how to help him , ' said fire chief @entity90 said			0
' i wish i could			0
i would if i could , but it ’s out of our reach			0
’ county commissioners said they certainly were n’t going to risk having someone lowered from a real helicopter to retrieve it , and the courthouse roof was too unstable for anyone to walk on it			0
unlucky : @entity9 said a breeze blew the 9 - inch helicopter into the statue as he took unsolicited promotional footage it would have to stay where it was , they said			1
@entity9 even resorted to asking sheriff @entity109 , a licensed pilot , if he would retrieve the helicopter and use the situation as a training exercise			1
@entity109 said no. ‘ let ’s put this in perspective , ’ @entity109 said			0
‘ he ran a helicopter into county property			0
it ’s no different than if someone hit the courthouse with their car			0
’ after a week of back - and - forth , the dust - up ended unceremoniously			0
the helicopter was finally saved saturday morning from the arms of @entity17 by volunteer brothers @entity128 and @entity129 , who hung out a window with a long pole			0
fortunately for @entity9 , he was able to keep his sense of humor all along			1
‘ all things considered , ’ he told the @entity45 , ‘ this is pretty funny			0
’ @entity9 said he was fearful he 'd lose the equipment so integral to his photography business , so he ordered a new drone before he knew the first would come down			1
now , he says , he has two			0
saved : after a week - long bureaucratic dust - up , brothers @entity128 and @entity129 simply leaned out a window with a pole to snag the chopper pricey : @entity9 's camera cost $ 1500 and , before he knew it could be saved he bought another			1
' now i have two , ' he said			0
the similar device pictured costs closer to $ 700 .			1
