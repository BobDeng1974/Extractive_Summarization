sale try - scorer @entity17 holds on to @entity3 fly half @entity22 during a combative first half @entity26 secured the bonus - point for the @entity5 after the break and that looked to have garnered the win , but the @entity3 produced an outstanding response			1
@entity33 's try and @entity35 ' penalty reduced the arrears before @entity38 's converted score sealed the win in the closing moments			2
@entity42 's men looked to move the ball wide early on but a needless mistake allowed the @entity5 to build their first attack			0
@entity46 and @entity26 both made significant inroads before the ball was shifted wide and @entity15 found enough to space to touch down			2

@entity33 is brought down by two sale defenders as @entity3 ran in four tries to steal the win @entity5 were caught short of numbers on the openside which meant @entity62 could slip through a gap and pass to @entity33			1
the wing made it into the opposition 22 and further pressure on the hosts ' rearguard eventually gave the @entity3 centre a clear run to the line			0
but back came the home side			0

@entity19 goes over in the corner to score @entity3 's first try despite a desperate defensive tackle it was proving to be a free - flowing affair and , after @entity5 had once again gone close , the visitors , perhaps unjustly , went back into the lead when @entity90 spotted space on the blindside and @entity21 finished well in the corner			1
@entity22 kicked the extras to take them 12 - 8 ahead , but they were unable to build on that four - point buffer as @entity97 's men continued to display plenty of verve with ball in hand			2

the gargantuan prop was stopped short but , under pressure , the @entity3 infringed and @entity123 was sent to the sin - bin for a cynical infringement at the contact area			0
down to 14 men , the @entity3 succumbed as @entity17 powered over from close range			0
the @entity5 ' stand - off was once again successful from the tee and the home side took a deserved 25 - 15 into the interval			0
@entity133 of @entity3 is tackled by @entity17 @entity120 of @entity5 having been dominated for the final 20 minutes of the first half , @entity42 needed a response from his charges , but it initially failed to materialise and @entity137 completed the bonus - point when @entity26 touched down unopposed			1
