every 13 year old boy dreams of scoring that one goal that will go down in the history books			0
@entity4 's under 14 team achieved something very close to that when they crafted a beautiful goal that looked like it had come straight from @entity10 's famed @entity9 academy			1
with some wonderfully choreographed movement , the young @entity4 swagged their way up field with some controlled one - touch passing and finished it all off with a goal			0
with the compsure of a miniature @entity17 the @entity4 goalkeeper plays a ball into his full - back some neat tiki - taka style football gets the young @entity4 out of a tight spot and they 're on their way it 's all about the triangles as they head at full steam towards the halfway line with some neat passing the strike came in a recent clash against @entity31 and was started off when the goalkeeper received the ball from one of his defenders			1
just like the tiki - taka style of play employed by @entity40 's famous @entity10 side - who won three @entity43 titles and two @entity45 trophies in three years - the youngsters showed great control as they worked their way towards goal			2
from start to finish , the ball was in the opposition net after just 30 seconds following a fine thirteen - pass combination			1
the memorable masterpiece was rounded off with an inch - perfect through ball and an equally precise finish and will surely have caught the attention of first team boss @entity58			0
a delightful ball with the outside of the boot leaves the left - back stranded and they 're through on goal the striker sets himself with his first touch and he finds himself in front of goal with time to pick a spot front man waits for the goalkeeper to make his move and coolly slots the ball home at the far post			0

youngsters score goal *resembling* something from a @entity10 *playbook*
strike came in a recent clash between @entity4 and @entity31
starting with the goalkeeper the ball is in the opposition net after just 30 seconds following a fine thirteen - pass combination
