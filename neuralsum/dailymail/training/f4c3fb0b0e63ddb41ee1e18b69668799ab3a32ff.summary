by @entity0 rejected : former @entity2 singer and convicted paedophile @entity1 has had his appeal bid against his sentence turned down former @entity2 singer and convicted paedophile @entity1 has had his appeal bid against his sentence turned down , despite arguing his sex crimes were ' not the worst '			1
the 37 - year - old singer 's defence lawyer had told @entity13 judges sitting at @entity14 that @entity1 had been unfairly treated when he was given a 29 year jail term			1
the 13 sex offences he pleaded guilty to last november included the attempted rape of an 11 - month old child as well as encouraging a fan to abuse her baby via webcam			1
police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself			0
originally , @entity1 had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite a damning video evidence			2
he changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then complained he had not realised that his guilty plea had made him ' look guilty '			0
while awaiting sentencing last december , he was recorded by prison officials saying the whole thing was ' megalolz ' during a telephone call to a friend			0
although 37 - year - old @entity1 did not challenge his 13 sex offence convictions , the disgraced rock star complained he was treated too harshly by sentencing judge mr justice @entity41 when he was handed a 29 year jail term as well as an additional six years on licence			1
as he sentenced the singer , the judge called him a dangerous sexual predator and told the now grey haired @entity1 : ' the public and , in particular , young females need protection from you			2
' @entity51 told the court that @entity1 had spared witnesses and jury members from taking part in what would have been a ' distressing ' trial , but had not been given enough credit for his guilty plea			2
she said : ' this case causes a very disturbing reaction for anyone who has has anything to do with it			0
we accept these matters are very serious			0
' he did not have to plead guilty and if he had done so the consequences would have been shocking			0
' i am not trying to minimise the gravity of these offences , just simply make the observation that a sense of proportion needs to be maintained			0
' these offences , however bad , are not the worst			0
' however , the appeal judges failed to be swayed by the argument and ruled they would not grant leave for appeal			0
@entity1 ' two female accomplices , who can only be referred to as @entity89 and @entity90 for legal reasons , were jailed for 14 years and 16 years respectively			1
@entity90 also had her appeal bid turned down			1
hearing : court of appeal judges ( left - right ) mr justice @entity96 , @entity97 and mrs @entity98 turned down his appeal and said his 29 year jail term had been appropriate ' shocking ' : lord justice @entity97 said that @entity1 's offences had been of ' shocking depravity ' , and required a lengthy prison sentence but lord justice @entity97 said the sentences handed to @entity1 and his female accomplice were appropriate			1
although a full judgment will be handed down in writing next week , lord @entity97 said : ' these offences against children were of shocking depravity ... a very lengthy prison sentence was demanded			2
' the @entity13 also said @entity1 did not demonstrate that his 29 year prison sentence was “ not unduly manifestly excessive ” and the sentencing judge had “ reached the appropriate conclusion ”			1
@entity1 was not present at the hearing and also chose not to appear from @entity115 via video link			0
@entity117 : the musician , pictured during a performan in 2011 , pleaded guilty in november to a series of sexual offences , including trying to rape a baby			1
