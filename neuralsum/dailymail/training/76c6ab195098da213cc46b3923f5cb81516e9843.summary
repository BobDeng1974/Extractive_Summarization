after another appearance as an emergency centre back at @entity3 in march , @entity0 was asked about the role he has filled all too frequently for @entity5 over the years			1
‘ you have to adapt , ’ said the @entity7 midfielder			0
‘ there are different jobs to do in certain games , different formations that you have to adapt to			0
that is not something that bothers me			0
i could do without centre - half at times , especially against @entity18 , but that is something you have to live with			0
’ still , @entity0 could hardly have expected to be back at the heart of @entity5 ’s defence in his first game under @entity24 in last weekend ’s @entity26 derby			1
@entity0 ( right ) could play the rest of the season at the heart of @entity5 's defence @entity24 's defensive injury woes forced the @entity31 to bring on @entity0 at centre back on sunday here is how @entity5 finished their 1 - 0 derby defeat against @entity35 at the back ... @entity37 ( winger ) @entity0 ( midfielder ) @entity40 ( a kid ) @entity41 ( a prospect but a rookie ) fit again after ankle surgery in the summer , @entity0 came off the bench just before half - time at the @entity46 to fill in once again when @entity47 was sent off for a second booking			1
he finished the game playing alongside teenager @entity40 after @entity50 was stretchered off with a dislocated shoulder			1
@entity52 may be forced to start with the same unlikely partnership at home to @entity55 on saturday , although he also has the option of @entity57			2
with @entity50 joining @entity58 ( ankle ) and @entity60 ( shin splints ) on the sidelines , however , @entity0 is preparing to drop into defence once again			1
‘ if i need to play there then fine , ’ he said this week			0
‘ i have not had a lot of football recently so i will play anywhere			0
‘ it ’s not somewhere i have played an awful lot of games			0
i have had spells of playing there over the years , playing two or three or four games in a season			0
but i do n’t mind			0
’ @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) were part of @entity5 's makeshift defence against @entity35 on sunday the @entity7 international looked assured at the back as @entity5 lost 1 - 0 to rivals @entity35 @entity79 was deemed past his sell - by date at @entity81 but is now playing in @entity82 for @entity83 @entity5 ’s injury problems in defence this season have raised questions over @entity52 ’s decision not to bring in a specialised centre - back in the summer despite losing @entity79 and @entity90 and spending more than £ 150million on new players			1
the latest names to be linked with a move to @entity81 are @entity94 of @entity95 and @entity97 ’s £ 10m - rated @entity96 , but @entity52 ’s hands are tied until the january transfer window opens in nearly two months ’ time			2
it means that this may not be the last time that @entity0 is pressed into duty as an emergency defender by the @entity31 , and the 33 - year - old ’s track record in that position suggests that it represents something of a gamble			2
he impressed in the 2 - 0 win at @entity111 in march , having previously played next to @entity58 in a 5 - 0 win over @entity113 in 2011 and in a back - three alongside @entity114 and @entity115 during a 3 - 1 @entity117 win over @entity118 two years earlier			0
@entity47 was shown a second yellow card for this challenge on @entity121 and will now be suspended @entity5 's spending included a summer buy on defender @entity50 who is now out with a dislocated shoulder in fact , last summer @entity124 suggested that @entity0 would be an ideal candidate if @entity52 was to persevere with the three - man defensive system he has long since discarded			1
but more often than not it has been an awkward fit			0
many fans will remember @entity0 being outjumped by @entity129 for @entity131 ’s winning goal on the opening weekend of the 2012 - 13 season after he was forced to fill in for the injured @entity90 at @entity133			2
subsequent appearances as a centre back alongside @entity58 against @entity136 and then @entity79 against @entity137 that season proved little better , even though @entity5 recovered to win 3 - 2 on both occasions			1
winger @entity37 ( right ) started the @entity26 derby at right back for @entity5 @entity0 is no stranger to having to fill in at centre back for the @entity81 club prior to that , @entity0 was at fault for one of @entity146 ’s goals as @entity5 suffered a shock 3 - 2 defeat to the @entity150 ’s bottom club on @entity151 in 2011 , and was also part of a back - three alongside @entity115 and @entity153 that was taken apart in a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity137 in 2009			1
there could be no blame attached to his performance at the @entity46 last week as 10 - man @entity5 came close to salvaging a draw after falling behind to @entity161 ’s strike			2
but as a gifted player known more for his passing technique than his tenacity faces the prospect of another spell in defence , @entity0 has more reason than most to bemoan @entity5 ’s baffling injury problems under @entity52			1
