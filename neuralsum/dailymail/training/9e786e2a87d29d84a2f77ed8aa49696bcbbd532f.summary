' i went over and said very politely that i was sorry but this is a quiet restaurant and we ’re trying to enjoy our meal and your baby wo n’t stop crying			2
i asked if they could take it outside for a bit , and said it might be tired at this time of night			2
‘ she just held it up and started shaking it and saying “ it ’s a baby ”			0
