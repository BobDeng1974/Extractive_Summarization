he even practiced his ' knuckle ball ' with son @entity20 last night at the @entity21 for the kids : mayor @entity1 was joined on the mound by a group of school children impacted by the recent gas explosion in @entity42 that killed eight ' i think they just booed because he 's the mayor , ' 35 - year - old @entity43 told the @entity46			1
