this is the dramatic moment four fearless @entity2 bison managed to avoid certain death by chasing a giant tiger away from their herd			1
@entity7 , 47 , captured the stunning shots as the @entity2 bison , also known as gaurs , teamed up to frighten away their would - be killer at the @entity13 in the @entity14 of @entity2			1
the photographer , from @entity16 , says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it			1
the chase : the group of @entity2 bison teamed up to frighten away their would - be killer at the @entity13 in @entity2 on the prowl : the tiger was walking in the open , heading straight towards a water pipe where the group of bison were having a drink on high alert : one of the gaurs picked up on the scent of the approaching tiger and made all the others aware of its presence speaking of the incident , mr @entity7 said : ' i was enjoying a late afternoon drive and after scanning the forest and i drove to the sunset point on the backwaters of river kabini that had gone completely dry due to poor monsoons '			1
' i was fortunate to spot a huge tiger resting underneath the shade of dried bamboo bushes , ' he added			0
' after a while the tiger started walking in the open and loud alarm calls were given by spotted deer and also the sambar deer			0
the tiger ignored these calls and headed straight towards the culvert [ water pipe ] to cool himself in a puddle , ' he went on to say			1
mr @entity7 said that a herd of gaurs were heading the same way to quench their thirst - a sight that ' really excited ' him as he knew he was going to see some action			2
one of the gaurs then picked up on the scent of the tiger and they were all alerted			2
' the gaurs seemed uncomfortable upon seeing the tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack , ' the photographer said			2
not going easy : the gaurs were uncomfortable at the presence of the massive tiger and decided to launch an offensive attack running scared : as soon as the four @entity2 bison charged at their would - be killer , the tiger decided he was n't going to hang around filled with fear : the four bison chased the tiger , who seemed more interested in saving his own life than making a kill mr @entity7 said the the entire herd of gaurs stormed towards the tiger , after first snorting aggressively			1
as soon as the animals charged , the photographer said , their would - be killer decided to run away			0
' the photographer admitted he was stunned to see the tiger backing away from its prey and said the gaurs proved to be a formidable force			0
' what an unbelievable sight this was - i have never seen such action - packed drama before , ' mr @entity7 said			0
' @entity107 are apex predators - meaning they are at the top of the food chain in the forest ecosystem , ' he added			0
great defence : @entity7 said the the entire herd of gaurs stormed towards the tiger , after first snorting aggressively safe : after being chased away from the scene , the tiger went back to sheltering under the safety of dry bamboo trees all in a day 's work : after seeing off the tiger , the gaurs wandered off into the @entity13 , in @entity2 's @entity14 mr @entity7 said gaurs are not normally scared of other animals , but taking on a tiger showed particular unity , strength and bravery			1
' @entity107 hunt gaurs regularly but it was amazing to see them working together - their strength lies in numbers and unity plays a key role in fending a tiger away , ' he said			2
' it really surprised me to see the tiger running away as tigers rarely back off as they are the kings of the jungles , ' he added			0
' but because it was a group of four gaurs and they attacked from all ends , the tiger had no option but to run away to save his life			0
' photographer : @entity7 , 47 , says he looked on with amazement as the animals clashed near a water puddle - with the gaurs standing their ground before the tiger made a run for it			1

four @entity2 bison were *relaxing* near a puddle of water in @entity2 's @entity14 when a large tiger approached
instead of running off , the bison - also known as gaurs - teamed up to chase away their would - be killer
*terrified* by the aggressive and charging bison , the tiger ran away from the scene as fast as it *possibly* could
