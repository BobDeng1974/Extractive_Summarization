we spend so much time in hotels throughout the year , but this one really stands out and the team there go above and beyond to make sure we feel at home			0
@entity63 is a unique place for us as we stay on @entity72 time to cope with the long hours we work due to it being a night race , so for the team , the hotel also switches to @entity72 time , meaning they serve us breakfast at 2pm , then dinner when we get back from work at 6am ! they keep the gym open 24hrs for us , have switched the maid service to the evening so as not to disturb us when we sleep during the day and have actually installed blackout blinds on the floors that we stay on so that we can sleep during the day			0
deep in focus : @entity0 pictured ahead of this year 's @entity87 exceptional service : @entity0 says the @entity62 in @entity63 is his favourite hotel what ’s been your most extravagant travel - related purchase ? probably when i fly privately , although i do n’t do that very often			1
it ’s mostly for races and allows me to get there and back a lot easier which country would you happily go back to time and again – and why ? @entity100 because it has everything			0
i love @entity102 , but also big cities like @entity104 , @entity5 ... it ’s all very different			1
@entity106 rules : @entity0 says the @entity108 capital is the best place in the world for a city break what ’s your favourite restaurant in the @entity108 and why ? my favourite restaurant is a @entity56 restaurant in @entity106 called @entity116 which does fantastic @entity56 food			1
i also really like @entity118 which does great traditional @entity121 food			0
where 's the best place in the world for a city break and why ? i really love @entity106			2
it ’s probably the city i know the most although i do n’t get to spend much time there anymore , as i live in @entity17 and when i am in the @entity108 it is mostly for training at the @entity131			0
if i was going to travel to a city , it would definitely be @entity134			2

an @entity100 family came up and told me they ’d been big fans for years , so i signed a few autographs for them before they then told me they had all my albums ! when i told them who i really was , they said they were still big fans ... although i actually do n’t think they knew who i was ! lookalikes : @entity0 , left , and @entity150 star @entity149 if you could pick anyone ( not family or friends ) famous to travel with , who would it be and why ? if i had to pick someone it would be @entity169 , because my fianceé is a big fan and i know she would like it ! although i ’m really not that sort of person and would not want to go on holiday with someone just because they were famous			1
i would much rather spend time with friends and family who i know i would have a great time with			2
