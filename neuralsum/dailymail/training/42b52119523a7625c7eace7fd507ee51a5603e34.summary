‘ he would be beaten a bit more probably , he was some kind of scapegoat			0
‘ what we most suffered from during the first part of our imprisonment was lack of food			0
the cold , too – we had no hot water			0
@entity10 and his fellow @entity2 jihadi ' @entity17 ' , @entity15 and @entity16 , saved their most vicious beatings for mr @entity4 ‘ i kept on the clothes in which i had been captured from the first six months			1
we had so few shoes that we were using to go to the bathroom that we were sharing them			0
‘ the shoes that @entity4 was wearing when he was taken to this place in the desert ( to be murdered ) i wore them too			2

both @entity153 and @entity154 as well as their @entity44 counterparts are said to have had him on their ‘ radar ’ for more than a year			2
