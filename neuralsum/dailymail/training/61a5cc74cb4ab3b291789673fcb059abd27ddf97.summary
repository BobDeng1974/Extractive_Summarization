by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 17:04 est , 20 april 2012 road to recovery : @entity2 , 15 , has finally been diagnosed with @entity3 - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day a teenager who used to vomit up to 15 times a day , spent six months on a psychiatric ward before her mother finally convinced doctors she had a physical condition , rather than a eating disorder			1
@entity2 , 15 , shrank from a healthy size 12 to a size zero within months after developing @entity3 - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day			1
but medics believed the teen was purposely making herself sick - and held her on a mental health ward for months before her mother finally convinced them she was suffering from @entity3			1
the condition caused @entity2 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , to vomit up to 15 times a day - and at her worst , she weighed just six and a half stone			1
her mum , @entity24 , a nurse , desperately tried to convince doctors that her daughter was not suffering from an eating disorder			0
but medics did n’t realise that @entity29 was actually suffering from the rare condition , which started after she got scared on a school camping trip			1
ms @entity2 said : ' @entity29 ’s illness very quickly took over our lives			1
' her vomiting cycles were furious and frequent and she spiralled downwards quickly , and her weight declined rapidly			0
' she went from being a bright , bubbly girl , to constantly being exhausted and a shell of her former self - it is a very lonely illness			2
' i painfully watched my daughter withering away while the doctors kept insisting she was doing this to herself - she said she was n’t and i believed her			0
' i had to fight and fight to get the doctors to listen to me - i do n’t want any other family to have to go through what i did			0
' weight loss : @entity2 , shrank from a size 12 to a size zero within months - she missed almost two years of school with sickness episodes , which can be triggered by feelings of stress or excitement , occurring on an almost weekly basis painful memories : @entity2 's backbone protrudes in this photo taken when she was gravely ill - she is now slowly putting on weight and back at school onset : @entity2 first developed the condition following a school camping trip when she was 13 - after worrying that teachers would leave the pupils alone @entity2 first developed the condition following a school camping trip when she was 13 - after worrying that teachers would leave the pupils alone			1
she got so stressed that she started vomiting - and for the next 18 months , continued to suffer horrendous vomiting episodes that could last for up to five days - where she would be sick up to 80 times in a week			1
the condition meant that bright @entity29 missed almost two years of school with sickness episodes , which can be triggered by feelings of stress or excitement , occurring on an almost weekly basis			1
ms @entity2 said : ' every time @entity2 had another episode , she would be admitted to hospital for a few days and then discharged			1
' everyone kept telling me it was a psychiatric issue , but i could see that it was n’t			0
the consultant called in the mental health team and eventually admitted her to a psychiatric unit			0
' while @entity2 was there , staff would take away her vomit bowl , and even hold her against the wall in a bid to break the cycle			1
' there had been a brief mention of @entity3 when @entity2 first started being sick - but doctors seemed to totally disregard it for months			1
' i was so worried they would never discover what was wrong with her , i used to cry myself to sleep at night			0
i thought i was going to end up planning her funeral			0
' @entity3 is characterised by recurrent , prolonged attacks of severe vomiting , nausea and lethargy , with no apparent cause			1
vomiting persists at frequent intervals , 5 - 6 times per hour at the peak , for periods ranging from hours to10 days or more			1
it most commonly lasts for between 1 and 4 days and the sufferer is generally in good health between episodes			0
there is no diagnostic clinical or laboratory tests for @entity3 itself - it can be diagnosed when other condition have been eliminated			1
who gets @entity3 ? it is thought that anyone can potentially get @entity3			2
sufferers are more likely than average to have a family history of migraine , and / or travel sickness @entity129 triggers a vomiting episode ? for many with @entity3 there is nothing obvious that starts an attack , for others some specific ' triggers ' can be identified which may initiate a @entity3 episode			1
physical stress is one of the most common triggers			0
going without food for too long and sleep deprivation can also act as physical triggers			0
when does it start ? the onset of @entity3 can occur from infancy to adulthood			2
it most commonly develops between the age of 3 - 7 years and it can persist from months to decades			0
it affects males and females equally			0
source : @entity153 it was only after almost 12 months on the ward that specialists eventually realised that there was something physically wrong with @entity29 - and were able to give her medication in a bid to control the vomiting			0
ms @entity2 added : ' @entity2 ’s symptoms have subsided recently - she now has n’t had an attack for a few months			1
' she is slowly putting on weight again , and is able to go back to school			0
' i am finally getting my daughter back			0
it ’s very painful to talk about , but i need people to be more aware of @entity3			2
' we do n’t know exactly why her condition has improved suddenly , it could just be a hormonal balance - but we ’re hoping she wo n’t have to suffer again			2
' we need people , and medical professionals especially , to be more aware of this condition and hopefully sufferers will be able to be diagnosed more easily			2
' i do n’t want any other family to go through what we have done			0
' dr @entity181 , from the @entity182 , said : ' no - one really knows for sure what causes @entity3 , although in the last couple of years , there has been research carried out which suggests it may be caused by genetic changes that can be inherited			1
' it ’s difficult to say how many people suffer from the condition , because diagnosis is so complicated and many people are never properly diagnosed			0
' however , studies carried out in @entity195 and the @entity196 suggest that somewhere between 0.1 and two per cent of the population can be affected at some point in their lives			0
' there are no tests to diagnose @entity3 , and therefore it is always a case of eliminating every other possible cause of sickness before a diagnosis can be made			2
' similar symptoms of vomiting can be caused by a range of problems from a brain tumour to kidney abnormalities			0
' but often the most hurtful thing that happens is that patients are told that they have mental health issues - it can be torturous for the sufferers and their families , and often ends up delaying a proper diagnosis			2
' brighter future : @entity2 and her mother @entity24 : ' i am finally getting my daughter back			2
it 's very painful to talk about , but i need people to be more aware of @entity3 , ' said @entity2 's mother			1
