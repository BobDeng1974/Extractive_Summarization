a distinct lack of organization , a huge fanfare surrounding a few big names , followed by a bizarre but somehow enthralling spectacle			0
if the @entity5 follows the same pattern as the opening ceremony , the next three weeks will be a lot of fun			1
during the pre-match festivities the @entity11 fans in the @entity12 seemed as excited for @entity14 as they were for their collection of players , assembled primarily from the smaller leagues around @entity18			2
but that all changed after 16 minutes , when the game , and the tournament , came to life			0
@entity23 striker @entity22 put the hosts ahead following brilliant work from young winger @entity26 , a reserve at @entity28 down the right , and @entity30 erupted			1
in the end it was not quite enough for the win , but it was a fine way to announce the tournament ’s arrival			0

@entity11 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 45 ) ; @entity26 ( @entity59 59 ) , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 90 ) ; @entity22 goal : @entity64 16 booked : @entity54 26 , @entity51 80 @entity41 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity65 ; @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ( @entity73 77 ) ; @entity74 ( @entity75 65 ) , @entity76			1

and they could have won this , @entity60 and @entity22 both spurning good chances to extend the lead when the score was 1 - 0			2
