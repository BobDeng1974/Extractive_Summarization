presumed @entity1 presidential candidate @entity0 came out swinging at probable @entity3 challenger @entity2 on wednesday over her recent claim that businesses do n't create jobs			1
the 2016 preview of what a match - up between the two politicians would look like came at a rally for @entity13 rep. @entity12 , the @entity1 's nominee to the @entity14 in that state , yesterday evening			1
@entity0 characterized @entity17 's blunder as ' breathtaking ' and argued that ' the problem in @entity19 today is that not enough jobs are being created , [ but ] they are created by business			1
' @entity17 has since clarified that she meant to say @entity19 's economy does n't grow when businesses outsource jobs			1
however , likely @entity1 presidential contenders have seized the opportunity to embarrass @entity17 over the verbal misstep and frame her as an extremist			1
as the midterm elections come to a close and the official start of the 2016 elections draws near , likely @entity1 contenders have also stepped up their criticisms of each other			2
@entity0 , a likely 2016 presidential candidate , made the attack on @entity17 at a rally for @entity1 candidates , in @entity47 , @entity13 candidates are expected to begin declaring the formation of presidential exploratory committees as soon as december , though many politicians mulling a run have said they 'll make a public announcement early next year			1
for @entity3 , @entity17 is the top choice to lead her party , making her an early punching bag for her ideological opponents			1
@entity1 have offered no such mandate			0
@entity0 , a former @entity39 governor , @entity63 gov. @entity62 , @entity65 sen. @entity64 and @entity67 sen. @entity66 are among as many as a dozen politicians expected to compete for the @entity1 nomination			1
the presidential hopefuls have been testing out their message on the road this fall as they campaign for the party 's @entity14 candidates in a handful of states that will determine whether @entity1 take control of the legislative branch			2
on tuesday , @entity64 also took aim at @entity17 's remark , comparing it to president @entity82 's infamous ' you did n't build that ' statement while he stumped for embattled @entity85 sen. @entity84			1
' the president says , you did n’t build that , it just sort of happened , ' @entity64 said during a rally at an airport hangar in @entity92 , @entity85 , according to @entity93			0
' the plane just sort of came into being because it was a public road and a public library			0
' @entity2 comes up and she says , " businesses do n’t create jobs			2
" anybody here think businesses do n’t create jobs ? ' @entity64 asked			0
' i ’m here today to endorse @entity84 and [ @entity85 gov. ] @entity103 , because you know what ? they know that businesses do create jobs , and i hope you know that too			1
' @entity64 continued to riff off @entity2 's gaffe in remarks at another event for @entity84 later that day , @entity93 noted			2
president @entity82 and @entity2 ' are on another page , they ’re on another planet , reading another book , ' he reportedly said at one point			2
@entity17 spent wednesday campaigning for @entity119 rep. @entity118 , the @entity3 's nominee to the @entity14 in the midwestern state			1
since making her gaffe about businesses last week , @entity17 has clarified her remarks to reflect her opinion that @entity19 's economy does n't grow when businesses outsource jobs @entity17 holds up an @entity119 - themed outfit for her granddaughter , @entity130 , that @entity118 presented to her during a @entity132 , @entity119 , event yesterday			1
@entity17 has been racking up flight time in the last several weeks as she 's traveled the country vouching for her party 's midterm election candidates what @entity17 actually said last week during a @entity140 rally for @entity3 gubernatorial candidate @entity141 is , ' do n’t let anybody tell you that it ’s corporations and businesses that create jobs			1
' ' you know that old theory , trickle - down economics			0
that has been tried , that has failed			0
it has failed rather spectacularly			0
' @entity17 said on monday that she ' shorthanded ' her analysis and denied accusations that she was running the left in order mollify progressives in her party			0
' let me be absolutely clear about what i 've been saying for a couple of decades : our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good - paying jobs here in an @entity19 where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out -- not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas , ' she told supporters of @entity180 rep. @entity179 at an event she was headlining for him			1
the former secretary of state 's original comment has been further broken down by @entity1 to : @entity2 believes ' businesses do n't create jobs			1
' if @entity17 does make a play for the @entity188 next year , the gaffe will most definitely come back to haunt her in @entity1 attack ads. already , the @entity1 has tried to paint her as out of touch with reality after the multimillionaire stated that she and husband @entity194 were ' dead broke ' when they left the @entity188 at the end of his presidency			2
despite her verbal flubs , @entity17 is still considered the candidate to beat in the 2016 bloodbath			2
in a subtle attempt to position himself as a viable alternative to @entity17 on thursday , freshman sen. @entity66 said the @entity1 would be handing @entity17 a victory if it sent another moderate politician to the general election			1
' the only way for @entity1 to win , i believe , is to run a candidate who runs as a strong conservative with a positive , optimistic , hopeful message , ' he said on @entity213 ’s @entity212			0
asked for his thoughts on potential competitor @entity0 , @entity66 , said , ' @entity0 has not declared his candidacy			2
i ’m a fan of @entity0 ’s			0
i ’m going to let him decide if he ’s running first and let the primary voters make a decision			0
' but i will say this : we need to learn from history , we need to look to history and what works and what does n’t , ' @entity66 stated , per @entity224			0
' if we run another candidate in the mold of a @entity227 or a @entity228 or @entity229 , we will end up with the same result which is millions of people will stay home on @entity233 ... and if we run another candidate like that , @entity2 will be the next president , ' he claimed			2
@entity65 sen. @entity236 has also knocked @entity17 for her verbal misstep this week			0
at a rally at @entity239 in @entity92 , @entity85 , in support of @entity103 gov. @entity103 , left , and sen. @entity84 , right , on tuesday , @entity64 compared @entity17 's flub to @entity82 's infamous ' you did n't build that ' line @entity66 went on to explain that @entity1 win when they ' draw a clear distinction ' between themselves and their @entity3 opponents			1
' we lose , and this is true over and over again , when we move to the mushy middle and we muddle the differences , ' he said			0
as @entity66 pointed out , @entity0 has not definitively said he is running for president - yet			1
his son , @entity252 , stoked speculation that he will ultimately take the dive when he said last sunday on @entity256 's @entity255 that ' it 's more than likely that he 's giving this serious thought in moving forward ... that he 'll run			0
' @entity0 walked back his son 's claims on thursday , saying he was putting the cart before the horse			2
' he ’s got an opinion			0
he did n’t talk to me , ' @entity0 told @entity266 's @entity265			2
' when you have kids , you ’ll probably have the same frustration , ' he said			0
' you love them to death and they have their own opinions			0
but i ’ll make up my mind , just as i ’ve said , at the end of the year			0
' there ’s nothing new here , ' he promised			0
@entity0 would come into the race as the early @entity1 frontrunner if he did run - setting up a potential general election battle between the two @entity19 political dynasties - polls show			1
the son for former president @entity285 and brother of former president @entity287 usually takes top billing in 2016 surveys of @entity1 voters , followed by @entity64 and @entity62			1
a recent @entity293 / @entity292 poll also showed @entity295 host and former @entity297 gov. @entity296 pulling out in front of other potential @entity1 challengers .			0

@entity0 argued that ' the problem in @entity19 today is that not enough jobs are being created , [ but ] they are created by business '
@entity17 has since clarified that she meant to say @entity19 's economy does n't grow when businesses outsource jobs
@entity1 presidential contenders have seized the opportunity to frame her as an extremist , however
@entity0 usually takes top billing in 2016 surveys of @entity1 voters ; @entity2 is @entity3 ' top pick
another possible 2016 @entity1 contender , @entity66 , *suggested* today that ' @entity2 will be the next president ' if @entity1 nominate @entity0
