by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 president @entity2 says @entity4 could stay on as @entity3 manager next season despite reports that the @entity8 will be replaced in the summer			1
@entity3 are currently languishing at eighth place and head into the final weekend of the @entity12 season looking to grab a place in the @entity14			1
' it was n't a mistake to sign him in january			0
we thought that he had all the requisites to be a good manager , ' former @entity22 prime minister @entity2 told @entity23 on friday			0
under pressure : @entity4 ( right ) currently sees his @entity3 side struggling in eighth place in @entity12 ' at the end of the season we will have a board meeting and we will make a decision together			1
' it 's not excluded that @entity4 continues as coach , if we can find an agreement on what type of relationship he should have with the club			0
' @entity4 replaced @entity37 as the manager after ending his playing career at @entity40 in @entity41			0
local media reports have claimed he is almost certain to leave in the summer , despite recent good form that has seen them win six of their last eight games and stay in contention for a @entity14 spot going into the final day of the season			1
@entity3 host already - safe @entity52 on sunday and are currently on 54 points , a point behind @entity55 and two behind sixth - placed @entity57 , who occupy the last @entity14 place and play at @entity60			2
hope : @entity3 president @entity2 ( centre ) has not ruled out that @entity4 could stay on @entity3 need to beat @entity52 and hope that @entity55 do not win at relegated @entity62 at home and @entity57 lose at @entity60 , as the latter drew both their matches with @entity3 this season and have a superior goal difference			1
should @entity57 draw , @entity3 will need to beat @entity52 by four goals or more to overtake @entity71 's surprise package and seal a @entity73 spot			0
they also need @entity74 , who are ninth but level on points with @entity3 do not win at @entity78			0
should @entity55 not win and @entity57 , @entity3 and @entity74 all finish on 57 points , @entity57 would take sixth spot due to their better mini-league record against the other two			0
however , even qualifying for @entity82 might not be enough to save @entity4 , as @entity3 chief executive @entity83 was caught on camera during last weekend 's 2 - 1 defeat at @entity86 describing the @entity8 as ' mad ' for not playing @entity87 instead of the off - form @entity88			2
playing days : @entity4 made 300 appearances in a 10 - year spell as a player with the @entity22 giants while carrying out his community service in an old peoples ' home , @entity2 recently said that he had met ' lots of people who could keep the @entity3 dressing room under control '			2
if the 38 - year - old @entity4 is sacked , former @entity103 and @entity104 coach @entity102 is reportedly the front - runner to replace him			2
according to reports , @entity3 are also considering @entity60 manager @entity107 , @entity55 coach @entity108 and @entity109 , currently managing the club 's youth team , as possible replacement .			1
