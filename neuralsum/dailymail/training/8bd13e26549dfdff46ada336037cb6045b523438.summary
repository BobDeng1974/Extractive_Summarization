' it 's expressing concerning about surviving in this age of big government			0

' @entity5 told @entity44 in an interview this week			2
' i did nâ€™t write them			0
that 's it , ' he added			0
the controversial newsletters , which reportedly made @entity5 $ 1m , featured a series of racist statements , including , ' we are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men , it is hardly irrational			1
' referring to the 1992 @entity61 riots , another read , ' @entity58 was only restored in @entity61 when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks			0

a letter signed by @entity5 in 1993 warning of a ' coming race war ' has also been uncovered			2
the scare - mongering letter written in 1993 lists far - fetched conspiracy theories and urges the reader to ' save their family ' by forking out for the $ 99 subscription			0
a video from 1995 shows the @entity2 presidential hopeful discussing the controversial newsletters			1
in the resurfaced interview , @entity5 - then out of office and trying to return to @entity101 - describes the ' educational ' newsletters and appears to be aware of their contents			1
' it covered a lot about what was going on in @entity109 : financial events , especially some of the monetary events , since i had been especially interested in monetary policy , had been on the banking committee and am still very interested in that subject , ' he said			0
@entity116 : the scare - mongering letter written in 1993 lists far - fetched conspiracy theories and urges the reader to ' save their family ' by forking out for the $ 99 ' this newsletter dealt with it			0
this has to do with the value of the dollar , the pros and cons of the gold standard , and of course the disadvantages of all the high taxes and spending our government seems to continue to do			0
' the video was posted on @entity133 by @entity134 , a self - described ' political junkie ' who has previously unearthed old videos of current presidential hopefuls , reports the @entity139			0
the candidate 's spokesman , @entity140 , told @entity142 that @entity5 was talking about an investment newsletter and that the incendiary comments were in others that he did not write			1

conspiracy theories : the 1993 letter warns that the @entity69 government 's redesign of currency was part of a plot to allow the government to track @entity69 scare - mongering : the letter makes far - fetched claims and urges readers to sign up to the $ 99 subscription to ' save their families ' controversy : the letter warning of a ' coming race war ' and soliciting the ' racist ' newsletters carries @entity5 's signature , pictured another clip dated 1988 , which was uncovered by the @entity169 , shows @entity5 talking about spending time on his newsletter when he was away from public office			1
' i also put out an investment type of letter because i 've always been fascinated with the hard money school , and been interested in the gold standard , so i put out an investment letter on those lines , ' he said amidst his run for presidency at the time			0
it is worth noting , however , that most of the ' racist ' text came four years after this @entity86 interview in the early 90s			0
. the 1993 eight - page letter , however , came a year after the most inflammatory newsletter was published during the 1992 @entity61 riots , and appears to carry @entity5 's signature at the end			2
oops : a 1995 video shows the @entity2 presidential hopeful discussing the contents of the newsletters contradicting his claims he was n't aware of them at that time the letter urges readers to subscribe to @entity5 's newsletters so that he could ' tell you how you can save yourself and your family ' from an overbearing government			1

. his campaign claims he also did not write the mailer , although it carries his signature			2
touchy : earlier reports made it seem like @entity5 stormed out of the interview , while the raw footage makes it seem like it was simply over the letter - written during a period in which @entity5 returned to @entity109 after a decade 's absence - claims that @entity5 - through what isdescribed as a network of ' extraordinary sources ' - had acquired information that would help his subscribers to ' neutralize ' the plans of ' powerbrokers			1
' the letter goes on to describe a number of conspiracy theories that he had ' unmasked ' , including a ' plot for world government , world money and world central banking			0
' it also claims that @entity5 's newsletters ' laid bare ' the ' @entity254 lobby , which plays @entity101 like a cheap harmonica , ' and a ' federal - homosexual cover - up on @entity73			1
' the letter urges readers to buy the $ 99 subscription to receive @entity5 's monthly political and investment newsletters , a copy of his book ' surviving the @entity263 ' , an investment manual and access to his financial hotline			1
