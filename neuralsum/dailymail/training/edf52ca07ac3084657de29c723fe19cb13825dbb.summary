a 27 stone woman who was too scared to have a bath for 20 years has spoken of her joy at getting her life back - after losing more than half her body weight			1
@entity5 , 62 , feared her huge size 38 frame would get trapped in the tub			1
but the mother - of - two shed a 16 stone and 13 dress sizes and is now a slim size 12			1
she now regularly enjoys 10 mile hikes – something that would have been unheard of before - and is no longer afraid to have a bath			2
@entity5 shed 16 stone and 13 sizes after she became utterly ashamed and depressed about her weight mrs @entity5 climbing @entity19 after her weight loss			1
before , she had to lean on a trolley to do her shopping because she was so breathless she said : ' before i lost the weight , i had had to lean on a trolley to do my shopping because i got so out of breath			1
' or , i 'd make sure i brought everything i needed downstairs at the start of the day so i did n't have to go up again , because i knew i would n't have the puff			2
‘ now i ’ve climbed @entity19			1
’ mrs @entity5 , from @entity31 , said the battle with her weight began after the births of her daughters , @entity36 , now 38 , and @entity37 , 40			1
she said : ' i 've always been on the big side , but not so much that i would worry about it			2
' but after the girls were born , the weight just piled on			2
' my problem was portion control and my love of chocolate			2
i could eat five bars at once when i had a craving			2
' i tried diet after diet , but while the weight would come off in the short term , afterwards i ’d treat myself and put back on what i had lost plus more			2
' by the time her daughters were adults , mrs @entity5 weighed 27 stone and wore a size 38 , which she had buy from specialists online			1
' my husband @entity57 has always been slim and by that point one of him could have fitted in one leg of my trousers , ' she recalled			2
the turning point came when the couple went on holiday to @entity64 in 2010			2
mrs @entity5 said : ' @entity57 really wanted to go abroad and we had n't been for several years so i felt it would n't be fair to say no. ' but i really did n't want to go			1
i knew it would be hot and that was n't good for someone of my size			2
‘ it was bad enough during summer in the @entity72			0
just walking down the street i ’d be dripping in sweat			0
’ mrs @entity5 , pictured before and after , said the battle with her weight began after the births of her daughters			1
she also ate huge portions and constantly gave into chocolate cravings , at times eating five bars in a row the plane journey alone left her with bruised knees from being squeezed so tightly against the passenger seat in front			1
once at their apartment , both the heat and shame left mrs @entity5 a prisoner in her room			1
she said : ' i never left the apartment during the day for the whole two weeks we were there			0
' i only went out to eat when it was dark			0
i did n’t want people to see me and stare			0
‘ i felt so down and guilty because my husband was off sightseeing on his own			0
i vowed then that i would never go on holiday again as a super morbidly obese person			0
‘ there were no photos of either of us from the whole holiday which is really sad			0
@entity57 would come back in the evening and say what he ’d been up to on his own			0
‘ it was utterly miserable and i knew i had to do something about it			0
' having seen a tv programme on weight loss surgery , on her return mrs @entity5 called her gp about it			1
‘ i was so ashamed and felt so guilty my husband had spent our holiday on his own , i phoned a week after we got back			0
' i thought if i did n’t do something , my life would be very short			0
i felt that surgery was the only long term option so that i could enjoy my life with my daughters and grandchildren			0
' during an appointment at a private clinic , the consultant suggested she think about a gastric bypass , given her history of failed diets and problems with portion control			1
but it certainly was n't an easy option she took lightly			0
' i knew there was a chance i might not come around from the anaesthetic - even though things are much more sophisticated for larger people now , ' mrs @entity5 said			1
ashamed at her weight and fearing she would die early , mrs @entity5 sought help for her weight			1
after losing three stone naturally , she underwent a gastric bypass - and has since lost 16 stone overall she credits her success with an online weight loss forum , which gives dieters advice			1
she said : i live a life i only ever dreamed of and have so much to look forward to ' ' but i was determined to go ahead			0
i even lost three stone before the operation to be safer in surgery and prove how committed i was to making a change			1
' even though i lost that , i did n’t dream of cancelling the surgery , i knew i could n’t do it all naturally			1
’ after being discharged home , mrs @entity5 used the charity website , @entity156 , as well as forums , for advice and encouragement			1
‘ i could only eat liquids for weeks , it ’s like weaning a baby , ’ she explained			0
‘ by week eight , i was on solids but could only have soft food , like stews or salmon			0
it was so tough but great not feeling i was doing it on my own			0
' if i had any problem i knew there would be someone out there who had gone , or was going , through the same thing			0
' after a year , mrs @entity5 had lost 10 stone			1
another year on , she has now lost another two and is a size 12 - 14 - a drop of 13 dress sizes			1
feeling fit , the grandmother climbed to the summit of @entity19 , raising £ 500 for the weight loss charity which supported her through her journey			1
' the bypass has changed my life and the charity helped me an awful lot , ’ she said			2
‘ by raising funds for them , i hope i can help them help others like the old me			0
‘ looking at photos of me back then , it ’s hard to believe i ’ve climbed a mountain and go on nine or 10 mile walks every weekend			0
‘ i live a life i only ever dreamed of and have so much to look forward to			0
‘ @entity57 and the girls are really proud			0
‘ one of the best things of all is being able to have a lovely soak in the bath at the end of the day			0
' for 20 years i was worried i 'd get trapped so i steered clear			2
