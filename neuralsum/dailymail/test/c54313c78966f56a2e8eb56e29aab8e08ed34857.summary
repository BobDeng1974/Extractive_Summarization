sixteen and seventeen year olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity5 because they have been brainwashed with @entity7 colouring - in books , @entity0 has said			1
the party said schoolchildren were being exposed to ‘ propaganda ’ from @entity12 in a bid to ‘ catch them young ’			1
it came as @entity0 was accused of performing yet another u-turn on its immigration policy @entity0 campaign chief @entity18 accused @entity12 of feeding ' propaganda ' to young people who could not be trusted to vote in a referendum @entity22 has promised to claw back powers from @entity12 before holding an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			1
@entity0 has called for the vote to be held earlier , and today warned under - 18s should not be allowed a say			1
@entity0 deputy chairman @entity0 said : ‘ it 's everything there from colouring - in books on the @entity32 for primary school children right up to research projects at university level			1
‘ the amount of money that the @entity5 is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous			1
overall the @entity5 has an advertising budget that is larger than @entity41			2
’ asked if schoolchildren were being brainwashed , the party ’s campaign chief @entity18 said : ‘ i think it 's not a million miles away			2
‘ it 's certainly designed to catch people young and feed them propaganda and a very partial view which you know just speaks up to the @entity5 being an unalloyed good thing that we could n't possibly do without			1
’ pushed further , he added : ‘ it is an emotive term but i would n't demur from the description of brainwashing			0
‘ we ’ve had many reports from our members of schoolchildren of secondary school age being exposed to overwhelmingly pro-eu views when the matter of the @entity5 is discussed and not really having the @entity65 case put			1
’ @entity0 deputy chairman @entity0 said the amount of money that the @entity5 is ' putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous ' mr @entity68 said the party was ‘ strongly against ’ lowering the voting age as under - 18s are ‘ too young / to vote			1
he accused the @entity72 of trying to ‘ gerrymander ’ a future in - out referendum after speculation they would demand 16 and 17 - year - olds and @entity5 migrants are given a vote as part of a possible post-election @entity83 deal			1
he argued the fairest way of holding a referendum would be to stick to the rules of a general election and said any changes could skew the vote			0
‘ let 's be frank about it , opinion research shows that 16 and 17 - year - olds are much more likely to be in support of @entity4 's membership of the @entity5 than is the population in general , ’ he said			2
‘ and the electoral franchise does not allow 16 and 17 - year - olds to vote and it 's no wonder the @entity72 wish to make this change but it 's a gerrymandering change which is clearly intended to skew the result			0
’ critics of @entity5 waste have previously condemned a colouring and activity book produced by @entity12 which promoted the work of bureaucrats and @entity109 at an @entity5 summit in 2013 @entity22 held aloft the book promoting the wastefulness of meps @entity0 was today accused of performing yet another u-turn on its immigration policy after it ruled out setting a net migration target hours after @entity117 said he would like to see the figure reduced to 30,000			1
the party leader on tuesday said cutting annual net migration from 300,000 to 30,000 by 2018 would be a ‘ return to normality ’			0
but this morning party deputy chairman @entity0 , who is writing the party ’s manifesto , said : ‘ there are no migration targets			2
’ ‘ i can tell you that there wo n’t be any mention of 50,000 or 30,000 in the manifesto and that ’s official party policy , ’ she added			0
the party previously promised to cap numbers at 50,000 before mr @entity117 earlier this month disowned the cap and said he would not set ‘ arbitrary ’ targets			0
mr @entity18 called on @entity22 to ‘ come clean ’ on any discussions he has had with the @entity72 about the referendum and then guarantee he will not meet any of the party 's demands			0
he said : ‘ we would like him to guarantee that none of these demands will be met , that mr @entity146 will not have a hand in the question , the timing , and that there is no question whatsoever of the franchise being changed from the general election franchise			0
‘ because in the case of 16 and 17 - year - olds they are far more likely to have been exposed recently to very strident @entity7 views and not to have heard the @entity65 case at all			1
‘ and in the case of @entity5 migrants , there is obviously a vested interest potentially in how they will vote			2
‘ we see this as an attempt by the @entity72 to gerrymander the outcome but we are also worried that @entity22 has a habit of letting the @entity72 take the rap for certain @entity170 things he might be planning to do			0
’ in 2013 the @entity5 unveiled a children 's play book that told how it takes four @entity175 to send a letter and depicted them travelling around town in taxpayer - funded limousines			2
the 10 - page book ' mr and mrs @entity109 and their helpers ' was an apparently serious attempt to shed light on the lives of elected officials in @entity187 , and 15,000 were printed			0
on page 1 , the couple 's work day begins at 8am as they arrive at the airport , briefcases in hand , to find their driver ' waiting for them in a limousine '			0
safely chauffeured to the office , mr @entity109 wants to send a letter to a colleague but does not have an envelope			0
the book explains - in four @entity204 languages with reading , games and colouring in exercises - how this problem is resolved with the help of three other people .			0
