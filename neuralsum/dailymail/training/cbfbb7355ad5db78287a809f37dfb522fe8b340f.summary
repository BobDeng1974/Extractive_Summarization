it shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing his genitals repeatedly in his face			2
sinister attack : an @entity4 football fan climbed onto an unconscious student from @entity17 and rubbed his genitals in his face following a game in @entity21 v for victory : the attacker raises his arms in celebration after he shoved his genitals into another man 's face - he then returns to assault him again at the packed fast food restaurant in @entity21 the alleged sexual assault happened following a game between the two colleges during the @entity49 where @entity50 beat @entity17 21 - 0			1
the clip , which lasts for five minutes shows a group dressed in crimson @entity50 shirts placing cartons on the young man 's head while whooping and cheering , snapping pictures on their camera phones			1
one voice , off camera , says : ' this guy 's life is over			1
' the hazing continues with rival fans sticking straws up the man 's nose and leaning over him while football chants echo around the fast food joint , where hundreds of fans have gathered			2
another man adds : ' seriously , i do n't see him moving ' before adding , ' someone has to pour water on him			0
' the man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious			0
' person of interest ' : @entity21 police have release the photograph of this man who they would like to speak to following the incident in @entity21 on january 9 getting into the spirit : @entity50 student @entity87 , dressed in the team 's shirt , poses for a picture over the unconscious @entity17 student ( left ) and having more fun ( right ) it is then that a rival fan , dressed in a baseball cap , red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of his pants and climbs over the other man , grinding into face			1
the identity of the man who carried out the attack was yet to be revealed and it was uncertain whether he was a college student			0

the recent college graduate is the son of @entity50 's @entity120 tv station 's sports director @entity118			0
the station admitted that it was their director 's 22 - year - old son			0
@entity125 , director of public affairs at @entity127 , told @entity128 : ' we were alerted to the video last sunday and immediately started a preliminary investigation			0
' no one in the restaurant where the incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing			1
because this is a possible sexual battery case , we are not in a position to release more information at this time			1
' college graduate : @entity107 ( left ) at first tries to reveal himself before he is stopped by his more sensible girlfriend @entity87			0
he recently left college ( right ) the victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state			0
however @entity147 , a criminal law professor at the @entity149 @entity148 , points out that this is a far from a straightforward case			1
he told @entity128 : ' technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime , as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			0
' but although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim , it will be difficult to do so			1
a jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify			2
' in this case , as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some , others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior			2
' that perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward			2
given this challenge , a prosecutor â€™s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case			2
' professor @entity147 teaches criminal law at @entity149			0
prior to becoming a law professor , he was an assistant district attorney for @entity187			0
disgrace : male and female students from the university in @entity50 put their fingers into the nose and ears of the unconscious student but not one offered him assistance			2
