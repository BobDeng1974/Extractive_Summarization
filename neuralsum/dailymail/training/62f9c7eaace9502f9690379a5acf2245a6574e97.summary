there are over 1,800 living species of starfish , also known as sea stars , occurring in all the oceans of the world the subjects of these mesmerising photos seem to glow with an ethereal inner luminescence that is almost out of this world			1
and they are indeed from an environment that is alien to us ; but it is under the sea , not above the sky , that they were captured			1
@entity17 photographer and marine biologist @entity16 took these incredible macro photographs of starfish beneath the waves of the @entity22 , the @entity23 and the @entity25 / @entity24			1

their upper surfaces may be smooth , granular or spiny and they attach to the sea bed with feet operated by a hydraulic system			2
the opportunistic feeders mostly eat other bottom - dwelling invertebrates			0
crossaster papposus : ' the unusual structures at the skin surface are common for echinoderms , it 's just gills , skeleton elements and pedicellariae , ' mr @entity16 said @entity76 : mr @entity16 , who has a degree in @entity78 from @entity79 , is head of the dive team at the @entity81 unknown : the luminescent glow of the specimens pictured by mr @entity16 is a result of the underwater strobe flash he uses asterina pectinifera : these pictures of starfish skin surfaces were made with high magnification ratios ranging from 1:2 to 2,5:1 @entity91 clavigera : the skin of this particular specimen looks like the macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm there are over 1,800 living species of starfish , also known as sea stars , occurring in all the oceans of the world			1

' this is just small collection of sea stars skin surface with high magnification ratio from 1:2 to 2,5:1 made recently in three different seas : the @entity22 , the @entity23 and the @entity24 , ' mr @entity16 said			1
' all those unusual structures at the skin surface is very common for echinoderms , it 's just gills , skeleton elements and pedicellariae			2
' but look at it ! i never cease surprised that nature shows amazing things			0
variety of forms and colours among starfishes are very huge and you can hardly find two identical stars			2
' mr @entity16 , who has a degree in @entity78 from @entity144 ’s @entity79 , is head of the dive team at the @entity81			1
he said : ' when i first began to experiment with sea life photography i tried shooting small invertebrates for fun with my own old dslr camera and without any professional lights or lenses			2
' i collected the invertebrates under water and then i shot them in the lab. after two or three months of failure after failure i ended up with a few good pictures , which i ’ve showed to the crew			2
' it has inspired us to buy a semi-professional camera complete with underwater housing and strobes			0
thus i ’ve spent the following field season trying to shoot the same creatures , but this time in their environment			0
' it was much more difficult , and i spent another two months without any significant results			0
but when you ’re working at something every day , you inevitably get a lot of experience			0
' eventually i began to get interesting photos — one or two from each dive			0
' now after four years of practice i get a few good shots almost every time i dive but i still have a lot of things that need to be mastered in underwater photography			0
