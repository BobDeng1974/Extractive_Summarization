@entity0 has insisted he 's got no issue with the critics who 've turned their guns on him after four months in the @entity5 job			1
despite going joint top of their @entity9 group with a 2 - 1 win over @entity11 on thursday , @entity5 's error - strewn display put the @entity12 firmly in the firing line			1
former @entity15 player turned tv pundit @entity16 led the volley of criticism by describing the performance against the @entity20 as ' pathetic '			1
@entity0 makes his point during @entity5 's narrow 2 - 1 @entity9 win against @entity11 on thursday the @entity12 manager says getting criticism is a part and parcel of such a high - profile job such stinging words came on the back of a string of indifferent displays across all competitions with @entity0 's side currently sitting sixth in the table having only won three successive games once this season			1
the 39 - year - old says he has no beef with anyone taking a verbal swipe at him , however , and insists his only concern is finding a permanent solution to his side 's erratic form			1
' i have n't seen so much from the critics as i try to avoid anything like that , ' he said			0
' but i know that at every big club you get this			0
i 'm used to it from @entity12 as well			0
' i can handle the critics no problem - but if i do n't see the answer , then my brain is starting to work overtime			2
' i 've been a big - mouth myself before			2
back home , i was talking in big words about how @entity12 football should be			0
' i upset a few other managers in @entity12 with things i said			0
i had a lot of arguments			0
i understand the rules now - talk about yourself and your club , that 's the most important thing			1
former @entity5 striker @entity16 called the @entity15 side 's performance against @entity11 ' pathetic ' ' the worst feeling i can have is that i ca n't solve the problem , if i feel i ca n't see the next step			1
i 'm using the hours to reflect on things we are doing now			0
' despite being roundly criticised for the display in thursday 's 2 - 1 win , @entity0 's has presided over five wins from the past six matches			1
but he readily accepts that the inconsistency his side have shown both game - to - game and within matches is something that has to be eradicated			1
' it 's hard at the start , ' he added			2
' there are tough times and good times - we are going up and down all the time right now			2
but that 's part of the job			1
' you can take one game here and there and get positives			0
people were positive after @entity101 then negative maybe after thursday because it did n't happen quickly enough			2
@entity103 slides on his knees after scoring for @entity5 on thursday night against @entity11 ' on thursday night it looked like they were a little bit afraid to lose			1
but when we went 1 - 0 up , suddenly everything was going smooth and quick			2
we need to get that freedom into our play			0
you saw that against @entity101 after the first goal as well			0
we have to focus on that on sunday against @entity115			1
' while acknowledging the need to produce more quality performances in the short - term , @entity0 has asked to be judged by the success or otherwise he brings over the course of the campaign			1
' again i have to say i think i have been very clear in my goals this season â€“ that we want to go through in the @entity9 and we want to win the @entity125 ' he stated			1
' winning the league is the main thing			0
if i do n't do that , or we do n't do that , i will understand that i have the problem			0
' the 39 - year - old manager 's focus now turns to the @entity134 match against @entity115 on sunday @entity0 , who met with chief executive @entity135 at @entity136 on friday to discuss scouting , revealed that @entity138 is nearing his return to the first - team squad			1
however , the winger is unlikely to be involved against @entity115 on saturday			2
' he could have played by now but we want to get him fitter so we can hopefully get more consistency in his play			0
so we are patient with him , ' he added			0
' he is a top player and we know he can make a difference in the team			0
it 's very important that if he is going to be the player he can be , we do everything we can to manage his situation			0
he has taken full part in training this week , so that 's positive			2
