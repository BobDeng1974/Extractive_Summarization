outside , the family saw rusty metalwork and missing drain covers around the swimming pool - and they noticed that most of the sun loungers were broken			2
mr @entity1 complained to a @entity5 rep and asked to be moved , but was told there were no vacancies elsewhere			2
shabby reality : in their apartment the family from @entity45 found mould on the walls , pictured left , and a broken light , pictured right after enduring four nights in the damaged flat , the @entity3 owners of the complex moved the party of five adults and three children from @entity58 , to the nearby @entity59 which was cleaner and in better repair			1
