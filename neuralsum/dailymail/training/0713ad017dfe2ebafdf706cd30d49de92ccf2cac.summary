the drink - drive limit is to be cut in @entity2 in time for @entity3 , it was announced today			1
justice secretary @entity4 revealed plans which to reduce the blood alcohol limit from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from december 5			1
it would bring @entity2 in line with the rest of @entity12 , but would mean the limit is lower than that in @entity15 and @entity16			1
drivers in @entity2 are warned that the drink drive limit will be cut from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from december 5 mr @entity4 said the new limit would send a ' clear message ' to drivers who ignore the warnings that there is never an excuse to drink and drive			1
he said : ' drink - driving shatters families and communities and we must take action to reduce the risk on our roads			0
' the latest estimates show that approximately one in 10 deaths on @entity2 roads involve drivers who are over the legal limit and research shows that even just one alcoholic drink before driving can make you three times as likely to be involved in a fatal car crash			1
' as a result , 20 families every year have to cope with the loss of a loved one and around 760 people are treated for injuries caused by someone who thought it was acceptable to drink alcohol and get behind the wheel and drive			0
we can not let this continue			0
' that 's why i have today introduced legislation to lower the drink - drive limit in @entity2 so that , subject to parliamentary approval , new laws will be in place in time for the beginning of the festive period			1
' @entity2 justice secretary @entity4 ( centre ) said the new limit would send a ' clear message ' to drivers who ignore the warnings that there is never an excuse to drink and drive the @entity68 previously announced the intention to reduce the limit following a consultation which found almost three - quarters of those who responded believed the drink - drive limit should be lowered			1
mr @entity4 added : ' getting behind the wheel after drinking can have fatal consequences			2
the advice is simple : if you have had any alcoholic drink whatsoever , do n't drive			0
no - one should be drinking and driving and the new lower limit only reinforces what should already be the case with drivers taking full responsibility and not putting lives at risk			2
' lowering the drink - drive limit will help make @entity2 's roads safer			2
it is the right thing to do and , most importantly , it will save lives , meaning that fewer families have to go through the heartache of a loved one lost			0
' the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) welcomed the announcement and called for the rest of the @entity96 to follow suit			0
@entity98 , @entity93 's road safety manager in @entity2 , said : ' there is a considerable body of research which shows that reducing drink - drive limits is effective in reducing drink - drive deaths and injuries			0
we would like to see the rest of the @entity96 follow @entity2 's example			0
