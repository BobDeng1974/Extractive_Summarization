by @entity0 10 - year - old @entity1 lives with his family in a two - room container in a refugee camp located on the @entity6 border with @entity7			1
one of an estimated 1.5 million @entity7 child refugees , his brother @entity9 , just 15 , is often away fighting with the @entity10 , while his father , badly injured two years ago , remains in camp			1
but while the plight of @entity7 refugees is well documented , less well - known is the impact the experience has had on the children - in @entity1 's case , a shockingly adult hatred of the @entity21 regime and ambitions to ' do jihad '			1
' i was still seven years old and i would keep crying and telling my father i am ready for jihad			2
' now i am older , i am ready for jihad			1
' sadly , as a new @entity44 documentary makes clear , @entity1 's shocking confession is by no means unique - and neither is his attitude confined to the rebel side			1
another child to appear is 14 - year - old @entity48 who lives in @entity49 with his father who is currently fighting for one of the @entity21 regime 's ' neigbourhood defence units '			2
like @entity54 , he displays a disturbingly adult appreciation of the situation , speaking endlessly of the need to ' defend the homeland ' and of his pride in his ' martyred ' uncle			1
' of course we all worry about my father but like anyone who loves his country , he must make a sacrifice and give his life for @entity7 , ' adds the teenager			1
' you wo n't find a country better than ours			0
i 'd tell [ rebel supporters ] to return home and live with us in peace or they 'll suffer the same fate as these armed groups			0
' clearly , the @entity7 conflict , which has so far ground on for more than three years and claimed more than 150,000 lives , will not be ending any time soon			1
but in a frightening glimpse of what might be around the corner , many of the children interviewed by the @entity44 's @entity78 spoke of wanting to take revenge on the opposing force or , as in @entity1 's case , become jihadis			1
' i would like to go back to school and become a teacher one day , ' says @entity1 's fighter brother @entity9			1
' but i was not lucky and now all i have in my head is never to drop my weapon until @entity90 [ @entity21 ] falls			0
devastating : @entity26 , a former rebel stronghold , was reduced to rubble by indiscriminate government bombing @entity93 : @entity1 lives in a container in a refugee camp like this one on the @entity6 border ' i feel that i 'll be martyred , @entity97 willing			1
i am not afraid for myself because i know i 'll be a martyr			0
it 's better to start a war and get killed rather than live like animals under the regime 's control			1
' ' we made this film because we realised that by listening more closely to the children , we would see the shape of a country 's future - and it 's a troubling one. , ' revealed @entity78 in an exclusive interview with @entity110			2
' children are not just cute or compelling sidebars in the worst wars of our time ; they are front and centre on the frontline			2
' one girl who knows all about life on the frontline is eight - year - old @entity25 from @entity26 , the scene of some of the worst fighting the war has seen so far			1
@entity25 , who lives in the old quarter , was trapped behind rebel lines during a government siege and was forced to eat the family pet , a cat , to survive			1
patriotic : @entity129 , whose father is a member of @entity21 's @entity131 , is proud of his @entity7 homeland haunted : @entity133 still dreams about the friends who were killed when her village was shelled by rebels worse still , her mother and brother were killed by a missile strike , the little girl catching a glimpse of her parent 's decapitated body before her father was able to take it away			1
' the siege was really difficult , ' she remembers			2
we had about 40 rats in our home and a cat			0
she would eat them all			2
' then a month later , they slaughtered her too			0
they sent some of it to us			0
they did n't tell us what it was at first			0
we ate it and the next day , they told us it was cat meat			0
' others , such as 11 - year - old @entity164 who lives in @entity49 , say they are haunted by the faces of the friends they 've lost - in @entity133 's case , her playmates from her home village which was flattened by rebels in the early days of the war			0
' we were sleeping when the shelling started , ' she says			0
' my mother and father lay on top of us to protect us			2
' men came and woke us up at 4am , grabbed us from behind and took us downstairs			0
when they did that to us , we were terrified			0
' we saw two men taking my parents out of the house			0
they did that because all the surrounding houses were flattened			0
when we left the house , it collapsed			0
' the bombardment killed many of the villagers and two years on , @entity133 is still haunted by their deaths			2
fighting : the war in @entity7 has raged for more than three years and has killed an estimated 150,000 people ' in my dreams , i go back to my old town and i see the ghosts of my friends			1
i see them and i see people who were shot , who are still alive			0
i wake up and ca n't go back to sleep			0
' tragic though @entity133 's story is , what worries @entity78 is what will happen when she and the other children grow up			2
' we were shocked by how children as young as nine years old spoke passionately of seeking revenge , ' she says			1
' we were saddened by children who spoke of their shame that they knew more about weapons , then writing and reading			2
' fighter @entity9 appears to confirm her fears			1
' i 'm 99 per cent sure the war in @entity7 wo n't end , ' says the teen			1
' it will continue to the end of days			0
generations will continue to fight on			0
' children of @entity7 , tonight at 9pm on @entity222			1

@entity25 , eight , was forced to eat her pet during the siege of @entity26
baby brother killed and mother beheaded by a missile that fell during siege
she appears on *harrowing* new @entity44 documentary , children of @entity7
@entity1 , 10 , also appears and says he wants to become a jihadi
says that at 10 , he is old enough to join older brother , @entity10 fighter @entity9 , 15
other children speak of their desire for revenge and ' martyred ' *relatives*
