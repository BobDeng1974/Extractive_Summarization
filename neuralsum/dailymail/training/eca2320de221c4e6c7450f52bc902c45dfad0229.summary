by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 18 february 2013 poll : news that the majority of people want to leave the @entity5 will be a blow to the political classes , including @entity8 , who want @entity10 to stay a member only one in three people in @entity10 think the country should stay in the @entity5 , a new poll revealed today			1
an @entity16 attitude appears to be sweeping across the @entity10 despite @entity8 , @entity17 and @entity18 all claiming the country is better off as a member			2
if an in / out referendum took place today 50 per cent of people would demand that @entity10 leaves , a @entity25 survey by pollsters @entity26 found			1
only one third of those asked would vote to stay in and the remaining 17 per cent would not vote			2
the majority also believe that the negatives of @entity5 membership currently outweigh the positives			0
it comes only a month after @entity8 promised a referendum if the @entity35 win the next general election in 2017			0
the prime minister vowed to negotiate to get a range of powers repatriated from @entity40 and said he would campaign ‘ with all my heart and soul ’ for @entity10 to stay in a reformed @entity5			1
last week former @entity35 leader sir @entity43 warned ‘ irreconcilable ’ conservative eurosceptics to keep quiet today as he warned they are undermining @entity8 ’s attempts to claw back powers from @entity40			2
key argument : only a third of people asked thought the @entity10 economy would be worse off leaving @entity40 , the survey found the former prime minister described mr @entity8 ’s decision to promise a referendum in 2017 as a ‘ gamble ’ that could lead to @entity10 ’s exit from @entity57 and warned the issue had ‘ come close to destroying the @entity35 ’ in the past			1
today 's results are based on a survey of more than 2,000 people			0

the @entity68 , schools and the economy were the most important			0
but despite the @entity73 sentiment , it may not mean a lot more votes for @entity76			0
only 10 per cent of people asked was ' very or extremely confident ' leader @entity78 could get the best deal for @entity10 , compared to 16 per cent for @entity8			1
a total of 11 per cent said they were more likely to support @entity76 but 25 per cent said they would be less likely to .			0
