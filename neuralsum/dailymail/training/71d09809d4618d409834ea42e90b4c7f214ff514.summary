@entity0 believes @entity1 must start with both @entity2 and @entity3 at the @entity4			1
there is a feeling in @entity1 that coach @entity7 may have room for just one of the playmakers in his side			1
but former captain @entity0 insists players of the talent of @entity14 's @entity2 and @entity16 's @entity15 should be accommodated			1
stretching it ? @entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 should both start for @entity1 at the @entity4 , according to @entity0 talent : former @entity1 captain @entity0 says both @entity2 and @entity3 should be accommodated in @entity7 's side the 37 - year - old told @entity20 : ‘ if you see the talent @entity2 and @entity3 have , they both need their space			2
for good players there is always space in the team but they both like to play in the middle , behind the strikers			0
‘ in the past they did n’t really play together , or one played on the wing			0
@entity7 chooses sometimes to play @entity3 as a striker , which i think is not his best position and he ca n’t perform as well there compared to when he plays as a @entity38			0
‘ it ’s a big decision for the coach , especially now with just one striker going in the squad ( @entity44 ) , it looks like one of the two – maybe @entity3 – will be playing up front			2
for their quality , i think they have to play both			0

@entity0 believes @entity14 and @entity16 playmakers are too good to leave out
coach @entity7 must decide how best to use the pair in @entity54
@entity1 have only @entity44 in their squad as a *recognised* striker
