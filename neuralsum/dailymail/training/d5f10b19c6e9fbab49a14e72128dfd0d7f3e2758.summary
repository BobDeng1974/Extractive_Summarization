@entity23 's communications team has been focused on pushing the domestic policy ideas he spelled out in his @entity151 speech			0
but @entity40 would no doubt also be involved in helping shape the @entity11 message on the myriad international issues confronting the president , including @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity82 and the @entity160 militants			2
@entity58 is part of a @entity11 exodus of top advisers			0
