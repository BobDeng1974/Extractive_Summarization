police say they have ruled out the possibility of an affair after ' extensive interviews ' with mrs. @entity19 , the wife of @entity20 , which are understood to have included a polygraph test			1
' we have investigated the rumor of the affair thoroughly after we learned about it ' , @entity24 police spokesman trooper @entity23 told @entity7			1

she denied it and we do not believe she is being deceptive			0
' @entity23 confirmed that @entity8 and @entity19 are friends and there is no way to know whether @entity0 believed that his sister - in - law was involved with the 31 - year - old trooper until and unless they manage to arrest him			1
@entity19 was the best man for his brother @entity65 when he married @entity13 in 2007			2
@entity19 did not return calls from @entity7			1
@entity7 also learned that she has recently left her place of employment , where she was an accountant			2

they say they do not believe he will target members of the public but they think he plans to kill more officers			0
if @entity19 believed his sister - in - law was having an affair with @entity8 , it could help explain why he traveled 25 miles to @entity107 to carry out his deadly attack rather than pick a target closer to his home just south of @entity36			1

' if it is truly a personal vendetta against trooper @entity200 and not the @entity15 or local law enforcement , the @entity199 / @entity117 should inform the public of this , so that the fear and panic that has been caused by their actions can be quelled			1
