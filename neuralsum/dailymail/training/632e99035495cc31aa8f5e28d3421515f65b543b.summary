it remains one of the great mysteries of the art world - what is the secret behind the mysterious smile boasted by the woman in the @entity8 , the world 's most famous painting ? now a group of @entity13 art historians and archaeologists believe they are about to unravel the enigma after discovering what may be the skeleton of the woman who posed for artist @entity18			1
@entity19 , the second wife of wealthy @entity20 silk merchant @entity19 , is recorded as buried in @entity22 convent and , after several false alarms , the team believe they have her remains			1
ancient find : archeologists have found a skeleton they believe belonged to the model who inspired @entity18 's @entity8 an archaeologist digs away at the floor of the medieval convent of @entity22 in @entity20 , where the skeleton was discovered the convent was the burial site of @entity19 , wife of the wealthy @entity20 silk merchant @entity19 , who modelled for @entity18 @entity36 , a former tv producer , is leading the team attempting to exhume and identify @entity19 's remains by sending the bones to universities in @entity13 and abroad , where they will be checked against the dna of two confirmed relatives of @entity19			1
if it is confirmed the researchers will be able to reconstruct her face			0
speaking to @entity48 , he said : ' once we identify the remains we can reconstruct the face , with a margin of error of two to eight per cent			2
by doing this , we will finally be able to answer the question the art historians ca n't : who was the model for @entity18 ? ' there has been centuries of debate over the 77 by 52cm ( 30 by 31 inches ) picture , also know as ' @entity8 '			1
most modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the @entity8 was @entity19 , who became a nun after her husband 's death			1
she died in the convent on july 15 , 1542 , aged 63			2
however , @entity36 is not certain whether the painting that now hangs in the @entity70 in @entity71 is of her			0
he added : ' when @entity18 began painting the model in front of him , he did not draw that metaphysical , ironic , poignant , elusive smile , but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed			1
' he believes the famous smile was added later and may belong to @entity18 's longtime assistant @entity78 , also rumoured to have been his lover			1
the team unearthed a skull and other bones last year that they believe belonged to @entity19 the skull was found five feet under the convent 's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae other art historians say the ' @entity8 ' is actually a sneaky self - portrait			1
an archeological team began digging at the abandoned convent of @entity22 last year			0
they first had to dig through thick concrete , laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks			2
@entity97 : the enigmatic @entity8 has intrigued millions but they quickly struck gold , finding a crypt they believe to have been @entity8 's final resting place and soon after they unearthed a female - sized human skull			0
the skull was found five feet under the convent 's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae			1
plans to continue the dig were suspended when the team ran out of funds , but they were able to resume earlier this year and found the skeleton			2
archeologist @entity36 , who is in charge of the dig , explained : ' we do n't know yet if the bones belong to one single skeleton or more than one			2
' but this confirms our hypothesis that in @entity126 convent there are still human bones and we can not exclude that among them there are bones belonging to @entity19			1
' several skeletons have been discovered but the group believe the latest find is the one they have been looking for			0
the initial discovery - made using ground penetrating radar and ancient maps and documents - came after a foot of modern concrete was removed and unearthed a layer of ancient , 90 - centimetre wide bricks			0
professor @entity36 said of the first discovery : ' this is a very exciting development and the find is consistent with our records and our preliminary research			0
' the crypt we have found is the one that was mentioned in church records from 1495 and was reached via a grate and then a staircase			0
' we also know from those records that in 1625 there was a second crypt and these are the ones we have found			0
' resting place : the courtyard of the @entity22 convent in @entity20 , where archaeologists have been digging present on the dig is @entity163 , who is related to @entity19 and who is also a close friend of @entity165 and former prime minister @entity166			1
speaking after the skull was discovered , she said : ' it was so emotional being here - i did n't think i would get so emotional			0
i am certain that this is the final resting place of @entity19			2
' it is not the first time that professor @entity36 has used such techniques in his work			0
last year similar methods were used to locate and identify the remains of @entity178 , another @entity179 master			0
in a @entity182 - style mystery , professor @entity180 also claimed that a hidden message could be seen in the eyes of the @entity8 after examining them with a high powered magnifying glass			0
the @entity8 is an oil on panel painting owned by the @entity190 government and the image is so widely recognised and caricatured that it is considered the most famous painting in the world			1
@entity18 started to paint it in 1503 or 1504 and finished it in 1519 , shortly before his death , and after he had moved to @entity190 .			2

history *experts* may have found bones of @entity18 's model @entity19 at a former convent
dna tests will be used to identify the former nun , who was buried at the dig site
@entity208 is a step closer to discovering what is behind the famous smile of the famous painting
