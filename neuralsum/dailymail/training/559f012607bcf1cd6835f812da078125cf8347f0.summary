some of the biggest losers will be those in their 50s who want to trade up to a bigger house or to acquire a second home			1
the @entity12 warned that people who want to take out an interest - only mortgage will also be affected			1
crackdown : tough rules on lending will make @entity4 's mortgage drought permanent - hitting millions trying to get on the property ladder in future , these borrowers will have to show that they are saving a pot of money to pay off the capital when the mortgage matures			2
the crackdown by the @entity24 is designed to prevent a repeat of the reckless lending which led to the financial crash			1
under the changes , to be revealed tomorrow , the @entity30 regulator is expected to force lenders to make sure that a mortgage can not be handed out unless a homeowner will repay it before their 70th or 75th birthday			2
as a typical mortgage is for 25 years , this will create problems for people currently in their 50s			2
for example , a person who is 55 will struggle to get a 25 - year loan because it would not be paid off until they were 80			0
@entity47 , from the mortgage advisers @entity45 , said banks and building societies are already clamping down ahead of the @entity24 ’s ‘ @entity50 ’			0
changes : some of the biggest losers will be those in their 50s who want to trade up to a bigger house or to acquire a second home he said : ' nearly all lenders will say , " if you want this mortgage , you must have repaid it by the time you are 75 , or even 70 "			1
' another change will be a crackdown on interest - only mortgages , the cheapest type of mortgage which helped millions to buy their first home or a larger property in the past			1
an interest - only deal is cheaper than other types of mortgage because it allows people only to pay the interest on the loan , but not a penny of the actual loan			1
a key new rule , expected to be unveiled tomorrow , will force lenders to make sure all homeowners build up a separate pot of money to pay off the actual loan			0
tricky : another problem surrounds @entity4 's 4.2million self - employed workers who will face an even bigger battle to get a mortgage they will also be required to check ‘ at least once during the mortgage term that it [ the savings pot ] is still in place ’ , according to the @entity12			1
lenders have already started to cut back radically on their interest - only mortgage deals ahead of the widely expected change			1
this month , @entity93 , @entity4 ’s biggest building society , abruptly announced it had decided to stop offering interest - only mortgage deals to new customers			1
it is a landmark moment for the mortgage industry			0
of the 11.2million mortgages , figures from the @entity24 estimate around 43 per cent are interest - only deals			1
@entity103 , of the mortgage broker @entity104 , said : ‘ many people are already delaying getting on to the housing ladder to the age of 35 and beyond			2
‘ it is going to get tricky for them because of the new age restrictions , such as when they need to remortgage			0
’ another problem surrounds @entity4 ’s 4.2million self - employed workers who will face an even bigger battle to get a mortgage			2
before the credit crunch , it was relatively easy for the self - employed to get a loan without providing much evidence of their earnings			0
the @entity24 ’s new rules are expected to make it more difficult , such as demanding two years of audited accounts , which many will struggle to provide or simply do not have			0
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity24 has already trailed the broad outline of the forthcoming regulatory changes for a long time , and the mortgage market has to a great extent already absorbed and planned for them			2
‘ on the one hand , this means that consumers are unlikely to suffer significant additional impacts as a result of the changes			0
on the other hand , it also means that the relatively high hurdles for customers in getting a mortgage are likely to remain a permanent feature of the mortgage market			0
’ the council ’s figures highlight the fall in the number of loans handed out to buy a house			0
in august 2007 – the month the credit crunch struck – 103,000 house purchase loans were made available			0
in august this year , there were only 55,300 .			0
