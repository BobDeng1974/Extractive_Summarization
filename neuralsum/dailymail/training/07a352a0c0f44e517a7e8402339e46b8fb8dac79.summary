by @entity1 reporter published : 17:20 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 19:05 est , 26 september 2012 the average @entity4 adult has just seven years of complete financial freedom to look forward to , a report revealed yesterday			1
researchers found the majority of us will only enjoy a brief ‘ window of wealth ’ between the ages of 58 and 65			1
this is the point at which debts have been cleared , kids have left home and a full - time wage still lands in the bank every month			1
' wealth window ' : the average @entity19 has just seven years of complete financial freedom and it is not before the children have left home and while they are still earning a full - time wage but just seven years later regular income ceases and we will be forced to live on a reduced retirement income			1
the figures emerged in a detailed study carried out by @entity29			0
@entity31 ’s @entity30 , @entity32 , said : ' this study offers a glimmer of hope for those hard - working young people who are currently strapped for cash and ca n’t see light at the end of the tunnel			2
' as an adult there will be financial commitments throughout your working life , but you can get to the point , albeit potentially quite brief , where things ease up and you finally have a little money to spend on yourself			0
' the mid to late 50s can be the point where you stop forking out for your children ’s education , cars , weddings and rent			0
' if you are tied into a 25 year mortgage this might also be the time when you ’ve cleared the balance			1
' but our findings also highlight the fact that , particularly in the current climate , it ’s more important than ever for people to get on top of their finances when they are younger , in order to boost their chances of achieving more comfortable later years			2
' three quarters of the 1,000 people over the age of 55 who were polled claimed they had very little disposable income during their 20s , 30s and 40s			0
little disposable income : during people 's 20s , 30s and 40s most most money went towards paying the bills , supporting the children , payments towards the mortgage or rent and loans during this time , most money went towards paying the bills , supporting the children , payments towards the mortgage or rent and loans			2
but four in 10 anticipate being richer towards the tail end of their career as they finally start to enjoy their hard - earned cash			1
the study shows the average 55 - year - old embarked on their first full time job at age 18 , settled down with a partner by 24 and started a family two years later			1
a house was purchased at age 27 and the mortgage finally cleared by age 53			2
by the age of 52 the children finally flew the nest for good and most parents stopped supporting them a year later			0
healthy savings : the average person was able to save £ 20,335 by the age of 50 but 61 per cent wished they had saved more the average respondent believes all their debts - loans , credit cards and store cards - will be cleared by age 58 , and they intend to retire at 65			1
when asked how they intend to spend their money during their ‘ window of wealth ’ , six in 10 plan to go on holiday , while 45 per cent will spend more money on doing up the house			2
a further three in 10 would like to eat out more , while 22 per cent will socialise with friends			0
the survey shows that more than half of those polled did save during their 20s , 30s and 40s despite other financial commitments			0
the average person managed to save a healthy £ 20,335 by the age of 50 , but 61 per cent still wish they had saved more by this point			0
only three per cent of people over the age of 55 are currently supporting elderly relatives , and those who are helping out financially anticipate doing so until they turn 65			0
@entity32 added : ' the 1,000 adults we polled have been relatively sensible with the spending and savings habits over the past 30 or 40 years , but despite this are left with just a small window of spending at the end of it all			1
' there is a clear message that regardless of there being a time at which you might not have so many financial commitments , it is imperative that you start saving as early as possible to help prepare for a more comfortable future			0
' and there is always the chance that by making sensible financial decisions , this window of wealth can be extended into the retirement years			1

researchers found that most @entity4 will only have a ' window of wealth ' between 58 and 65 - years - old
this is when debts have been cleared , kids have left home and a full - time wage is still being earned
