by @entity1 reporter published : 12:08 est , 7 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:46 est , 7 december 2013 while this bear might score 10/10 for cuteness , he has a lot to learn about playing hide and seek ... he can be seen from a mile off			1
the brown one - year - old bear gave up trying to climb the trunk 's slippery bark and made do with cuddling it instead during playtime in the forest in @entity15 , in rural east @entity16			1
it even looks like the youngster is trying to hide from his brother and sister as he creeps behind the tree , leaving just a furry ear poking out			1
you ca n't see me ! the young bear does a bad job of making himself invisible before showing himself again photographer @entity29 , 52 , took the shots from the safety of a house about 10m away in a wildlife centre in the woods			2
mr @entity29 said : ' the bears were around the house all night and the next morning			2
' the mother bear was always nearby waiting for the cubs and when she felt they had played enough she would lead them further into the forest			1
' i was very lucky ; i 've never seen anything like it and was pleasantly surprised that i could photograph the bears at such close hand			2
' most of all i liked the picture where the bear was hiding behind a tree and was seen only by his ear			2
how do you climb this thing ? the cub tries several times to scale the smooth tree trunk before giving up and hugging it he added : ' these cubs were very funny and cheerful			0
they constantly played with each other , fighting , tumbling and standing up on their hind legs			1
' they repeatedly tried to climb the tree , but it was smooth , and so eventually they realised they were unable to climb on it			0
' mr @entity29 , a married father of two who works as a @entity71 teacher in @entity72 , 70 miles from the centre , was bear - watching with three other tourists			0
they were visiting the @entity77 centre in the eastern region of @entity79			0
@entity80 walks @entity81 : photographer @entity29 said the cubs ' mother was never far away while the young bears played what shall i do next with this tree ? the cub has already tried climbing it , hiding behind it and cuddling it with its lakes and uninhabited forests , @entity79 is a mecca for tourists keen to see wild animals up close			1
mr @entity29 said : ' @entity98 are very cautious animals so it 's rare to see them normally in the forest			0
' in the forest , a person can pass by bears without noticing it , but an encounter with a bear always leaves a lasting impression			0
' when you hear him breathing and growling five metres away from you , run			0

played with siblings in @entity15 , in rural east @entity16
