a woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it was n't a mistake			1
@entity5 , 24 , was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg			1
doctors said they would have to remove her left knee to save her life			0
but instead of an amputation , @entity5 opted for a ' rotationplasty ' : when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards			1
it means @entity5 , from @entity17 , has more control over her prosthetic calf			1
the operation , which removed a cancerous tumor , saved her life the forward - facing heel acts as a new knee and the foot can move like a shin			2
if she needs to , @entity5 can even apply weight to the foot - which has retained its feeling - and walk on it			2
the then - novel procedure was one of three options available to @entity5 , while she endured a grueling chemotherapy program			2
doctors could have amputated her leg below the thigh or created a ' stiff leg '			0
more control : the decision @entity5 and her parents made when she was seven ( left ) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation delighted : seven - year - old @entity5 was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery due to her age , @entity5 was not eligible for ' limb salvage ' , where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue , as her legs were not fully developed			1
instead , she opted for rotationplasty , which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees			1
writing on @entity59 , her mother said : ' i remember this being the hardest decision our family has ever faced			0
when we initially learned of rotationplasty , i have to admit , it took time to absorb			0
we had many questions and desperately wanted to connect with others who had already chosen this procedure , but found that to be difficult			0
' no regrets : @entity5 has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg , @entity5 said she never thought twice about it			1
and learning to walk was simple - unlike the months - long process most amputees endure			0
' as soon as my leg healed , i was walking with a prosthetic and it took me about three seconds to learn how to rewalk , ' @entity5 told @entity84			0
hoping to inspire children who are facing the same predicament she tackled 17 years ago , @entity5 has founded a charity called @entity88 that supports young cancer sufferers .			0

@entity5 , 24 , was diagnose with osteosarcoma at the age of 7
she opted for the then - novel procedure called rotationplasty
doctors removed her left calf and knee , rotated foot 180 degrees and attached it to her thigh
it gives her greater control over her prosthetic leg , she has ' no regrets '
