click here to read @entity2 's match report as a @entity4 goal was enough to hand the home side victory this was @entity9 derby ‘ lite ’			1
the derby that never really felt like one or sounded like one and , ultimately , was robbed of any significance or real context by the actions of one player			2
maybe it was nerves , a sense of neither club knowing where they stood before kick - off			1
maybe football is just becoming more gentrified with each passing season			0
whatever the case , there was never any fizz about this occasion			0
both clubs — both sets of supporters — seemed rather anxious to get it over with and move on			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity35 slam @entity33 for stupid red card @entity33 was shown a second yellow card for this first half challenge on @entity39 referee @entity40 had no choice but to give smalling his marching orders following the tackle then , when it started , @entity33 ruined it			1
a senseless sending off for two pieces of brainless football			0
the first offence was always going to have one outcome			0
the second , a tackle so late the tv cameras did well to catch it , was particularly reckless given what had already happened			2
‘ it was n’t very smart , ’ said @entity35			1
the @entity58 manager added that @entity33 had apologised			1
his face suggested the apology had not necessarily been accepted			0
@entity33 ’s red card certainly robbed his team			1
they had some momentum prior to that moment			0
they had started brightly , seeking to exploit some hesitancy in a strangely lifeless @entity68			1
in the wider context , though , @entity33 ’s dismissal left the occasion and the game distorted			1
you can never learn much from a 10 versus 11 contest and so it was here			0
the happiest coach in the land may well be @entity79 ’s @entity78			1
his team are now 13 points ahead of @entity58 so we can presume the @entity83 title challenge for @entity85 ’s side is now over — if it ever existed			1
@entity79 are as unlikely to lose five times between now and next may as @entity58 are to win every game			1
@entity33 was shown his first yellow card of the game for the challenge of @entity68 keeper @entity91 @entity35 gives instructions to @entity93 shortly after @entity33 's red card there were no players from @entity9 in either side ’s starting @entity98 , but five from @entity99 — @entity4 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
@entity78 will also have sensed ongoing issues among sunday ’s victors			1
city were only truly effective for half an hour			2
certainly they should have had penalties and @entity109 made a couple of very good saves when the teams were numerically equal			0
in the wake of an excellent @entity4 goal , however , they lost their way			0
aimless , unintelligent football returned and if they were not exactly hanging on at the full - time , they were certainly happy to hear @entity40 ’s whistle			2
as @entity58 pressed late on , @entity93 may have scored — choosing to cut inside instead of shooting — @entity91 made a super save from @entity123 and @entity124 somehow managed to connect only with his shoulder when escaping from @entity126 at a set piece right in front of goal			2
@entity4 celebrates scoring @entity68 's winning goal at the @entity131 on sunday @entity79 boss @entity78 will have sensed that there are ongoing issues at @entity68 had any of those incidents led to a goal , city manager @entity134 would have been thinking introspectively yet again on monday morning			1
the line his team is walking between good and bad is very fine at the moment and it will be interesting to see if they can find the performance they need at home to @entity144 in the @entity145 on wednesday			0
from a statistical point of view , there are some numbers to trouble @entity58			2
this was the fourth time on the spin city have beaten them — the last time that happened was in 1970 — while their own league tally of 13 points represents their worst start to a domestic season since 1986			1
@entity58 are now 13 points behind @entity83 leaders @entity79 neither of these stats really seemed to fit the mood at full - time on sunday , though			1
if you are of a red persuasion you may not feel quite that glum			0
players continue to get injured , on the training pitch and in combat , while @entity170 continues to look like somebody who has just walked on to the set of @entity173 in their eyes			0
for the moment at least , meanwhile , the previously excellent @entity103 looks in need of some direction and a more easily identifiable role in @entity85 ’s formation			0
there is a feeling , though , that @entity85 does have @entity58 stuttering along gently in the right direction			2
@entity170 ( right ) has struggled to make an impact for @entity58 so far this season as he said on sunday , they continue to have problems with retaining the ball but the calamity football of early season does seem a little distant now			1
the return of their captain helped			0
@entity93 was excellent in a withdrawn position and one wonders how long it will be before @entity85 decides to choose @entity195 ahead of him rather than @entity196			0
@entity58 may yet benefit from not playing @entity198 football			2
@entity85 clearly needs time on the training field and he perhaps will not mind too much the lack of clutter on the schedule			0
@entity68 do not have that luxury and , it has to be said , they do look a little leggy			2
maybe this result will nudge them into gear again and certainly their celebrations at the end were indicative of relief			0
this will not be a derby that lives long in the memory			2
unanswered questions hang heavy for blue and for red			0
@entity93 , who has missed @entity58 's last three @entity83 games , was excellent in a withdrawn position @entity195 shakes hands with former @entity58 boss sir @entity222 before kick - off			1

@entity68 *defeat* @entity58 in derby to forget
@entity33 sent off for picking up two first half yellow cards
@entity35 claims @entity33 's tackle ' was *n't* very smart '
@entity68 struggled to make one - man *advantage* count for the *majority*
@entity78 will sense ongoing issues at title rivals @entity68
united now 13 points behind @entity83 leaders @entity79
