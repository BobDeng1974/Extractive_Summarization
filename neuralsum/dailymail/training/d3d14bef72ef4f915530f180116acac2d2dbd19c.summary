the study asked parents with two children about the cost of kitting out their kids for the new academic year			1
according to respondents , every year parents have to replace jumpers , polo shirts , trousers and school shoes , adding up to about £ 189 per child			1
so @entity17 has put together a list of supermarkets - including @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 's - in which you can kit the kids out to go back to school for almost half that : £ 98.49			1
some parents invest in pricier items and spend up to £ 200 in the hope that they will last longer the all - important winter coat was considered another pricey buy , often averaging at £ 30 for a decent high street purchase , with sports kits coming to a total of £ 20			1
other items including pencil cases , stationery and school bags contributed to the cost averaging at a total of £ 25			2
for those parents with children at secondary school , extra costs came for blazers , ties and collared shirts			1
when asked about the general pricing of uniform , over half , 53 per cent of parents , said that it was expensive but something they had to buy			2
they also said they could budget for it as they knew that expense would be coming around every august and september			0
parents say kids demand a new pencil case and stationery each year one respondent said : ' i always know september is going to be an expensive month when my boys go back to school			2
' the summer holidays is only six weeks long but they seem to grow so much in that time meaning everything needs to be replaced			0
' on the uniform alone i usually end up spending about £ 200 , i do tend to buy more expensive things with the hope that they ’ll last longer			0
' another woman involved in the study commented : ' buying a school uniform is just one of those things you ca n’t avoid			0
' the uniform is n’t so bad because kids do grow out of them , but i get frustrated when my children demand a new pencil case and stationery each year			0
i have no idea what happens to them			0
' a spokesperson for @entity87 , who conducted the research , said : ' a lot of parents dread doing the uniform shop which is understandable because it is very expensive these days , but there are ways to keep the costs down			0
' shopping around to find cheaper alternatives is one way to reduce the costs and also by bulk buying where possible at the start of the school year			0
