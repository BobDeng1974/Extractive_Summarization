by @entity0 he chose to step down from hosting @entity2 after accepting the ‘ rigours ’ of working on live television had become too much for him – but declined to elaborate on what they were			2
now the director of the popular saturday night show has revealed what sir @entity10 was reluctant to divulge			1
@entity12 said that his refusal to wear an earpiece – as well as his failing eyesight – made the veteran host a ‘ challenge ’ to work with and resulted in the autocue getting bigger and closer during each series			1
@entity20 to see him : sir @entity10 and his former co-host on @entity2 @entity23 sir @entity10 , 86 , announced his decision to quit strictly in april after ten years of presenting the show issuing a statement in which he said : ‘ after ten wonderful years and 11 series , i believe that it is now the right time to step down from the rigours of presenting the @entity2 live shows			1
’ he confirmed he would only continue with presenting the show ’s specials and in recent weeks said he feared going off like ‘ stale fruit ’ if he remained in the post much longer			2
now miss @entity12 has admitted that it was becoming a struggle for sir @entity10 to keep up with the weekly filming schedule			1
director @entity12 has admitted that it was becoming a struggle for sir @entity10 to keep up with the weekly filming schedule speaking at a @entity43 on monday night , she said : ‘ ‘ he ’s brilliant @entity10 , he ’s a legend , it ’s just that he comes with various things he wo n’t do which do n’t help in the live show			1
‘ it would be great to be able to say in his ear that something ’s happened and give him directions but it ’s just a bit like ok @entity10 , off you go			2
and to be honest he ’s such a people person that if anything does go wrong you ’re in safe hands , because he can make a drama and a comedy out of anything			0
' but it is a challenge			0
and the autocue font has been getting bigger and bigger and getting closer and closer			2
’ @entity23 , 45 , and @entity62 , 42 , will now co-host the series when it returns this autumn			0
@entity64 hosts : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity62 are the new regular presenters of @entity2 , following the departure of sir @entity10 also speaking at the event was costume designer @entity68 , who revealed the surprising secret to making sure everything stays tucked in during energetic dances – she sews a pair of @entity73 onto the base hems of shirts			1
and professional dancer @entity76 spoke about his own fears that his days on @entity2 might be numbered			0
as one of only two professionals to have been in the show since it started in 2004 , @entity76 , 38 , has partnered celebrities including @entity82 , @entity84 cyclist @entity83 and singer @entity85			0
but his only win was the very first series with @entity89 newsreader @entity88			0
revealing his concerns , @entity76 said : ‘ we never know before may or june which i think is particularly rude , because actually you ca n’t plot your end of the year , which you block out for @entity2 , and chances are the phone ’s gon na ring and they ’ll say “ well actually , we ’re not gon na use you this series ” and you go “ well thanks very much , how am i gon na pay my mortgage ? ” ‘ so there ’s that kind of dilemma			0
but i guess as long as you keep getting better , and bringing new thinks to the table … but they ’ve got to keep things fresh			0
people will come and go , one day it ’ll be me and it will be very sad , @entity2 is a part of my life			0
’ a @entity117 spokesman commented : ‘ @entity2 director @entity12 has had a great working relationship with sir @entity10 for eight years , and she regards him as the ultimate professional			1
' the question posed at @entity43 regarding his refusal to wear an earpiece is misleading as @entity10 is n’t required to wear an earpiece because , as @entity12 said , with @entity10 you ’re in safe hands			1

refusal to wear an earpiece and failing eyesight made the host , 86 , a ‘ challenge ’ to work with says show boss
' @entity137 font has been getting bigger and bigger and closer and closer ’
@entity117 spokesman *denied* sir @entity10 needed an earpiece and says that he is the ' ultimate professional '
