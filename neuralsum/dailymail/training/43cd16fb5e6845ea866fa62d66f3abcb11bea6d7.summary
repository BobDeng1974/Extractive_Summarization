@entity7 was just 13 when she wrote online that she *disliked* a *teacher* 's aide for being mean - and she was suspended from school
a parent then told the school @entity7 had an online conversation of a sexual nature with her son and the school demanded her password
she gave it to them and was humiliated as they looked through her messages ; her mother had not given her consent
her attorney argued that *administrators* should not be in charge of dealing with what students write out of school
she dropped out of the school and is now being home schooled
