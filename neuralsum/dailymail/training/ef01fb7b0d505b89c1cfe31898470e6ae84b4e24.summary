by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:46 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 17:40 est , 28 may 2012 we live in a country four times wealthier than it was when the @entity5 came to the throne , according to an official count produced for the jubilee today			1
but we are more likely to make our money out of shops than the metal - bashing and manufacturing that dominated our commercial life 60 years ago			0
we have nearly four times as many divorces , about a third fewer marriages , and a country where people are likely to be much older than in the 1950s			1
the breakdown of the differences between @entity21 in 1952 and @entity21 now was produced by the @entity22 and other @entity24 departments to mark the @entity26 celebrations , which reach their climax next weekend			2
experience : the @entity5 has seen her country change so dramatically since her @entity32 ceremony in 1953 it showed that when the @entity5 came to the throne the wealth of the nation was , in raw figures , about 100 times less than it is now			2
gross domestic product totalled £ 15,983 million , against £ 1,507,585 million in 2011			2
however inflation has taken a very large bite out of the value of the pound over 60 years			2
a 1952 pound is worth £ 24.34 today – so that the national wealth is really only slightly under four times greater now than then			1
there are nearly 600,000 men now working as shop managers or assistants or in sales , the figures showed			0
retail jobs did not figure among the top five occupations for men 60 years ago			1
instead , there were more than 400,000 men in metalworking , engineering and electrical trades , and nearly 400,000 more classed as unskilled industrial labourers			2
different industries : sixty years ago there were more than 400,000 men in the metalworking industry whereas now more men work in retail non-committal : we have nearly four times as many divorces , about a third fewer marriages than in 1952 , according to the @entity22 in 1952 there were more than 370,000 women working as domestic servants and 215,000 classed as charwomen or office cleaners			1
today , there are more women working as domestic cleaners – 384,000 – and a further 446,000 in the booming care industry , working either as care home assistants or home carers			0
a second report , from the @entity83 , reveals the scale of the extraordinary social change in @entity21 as people are living longer than ever before			0
in 1952 , there were just 300 centenarians in @entity89 and @entity90			1
today there are around 13,420 people alive today who have celebrated their 100th birthday			1
women 's work : in 1952 there were more than 370,000 women working as domestic servants but today 446,000 work in the care industry inflation : a 1952 pound is worth £ 24.34 today so that the national wealth is really only slightly under four times greater now than then over the last 60 years , the department estimates the @entity5 has sent around 110,000 telegrams and messages to people who have reached the landmark birthday			1
but she will be writing to record numbers each year as the number of people who are expected to survive until 100 is set to balloon			0
a baby boy born in 1952 was expected to live to the age of 78			0
a baby boy born today is expected to live to 91 , with around 32 per cent reaching 100			0
meanwhile , a baby girl is living for 11 years longer than in 1952 , with life expectancy at birth rising from 83 to 94			0
@entity117 ( gdp ) £ 15.9 million life expectancy ( boy ) 78 life expectancy ( girl ) 83 people aged 100 and over 300 % of pensioners in population 14 employment ( men ) 400,000 in metalworking , engineering and electrical trades employment ( women ) 370,000 domestic servants and 215,000 charwomen or office cleaners gdp £ 1.5 billion life expectancy ( boy ) 91 life expectancy ( girl ) 94 people aged 100 and over 13420 % of pensioners in population 20 employment ( men ) 600,000 as shop managers or assistants or in sales employment ( women ) 384,000 domestic cleaners and 446,000 care home assistants or home carers soaring life expectancy means pensioners make up one in five of the population , compared to only one in seven – or 14 per cent – in 1952			1
experts warn children may live to 100 , but they will not get their state pension until they are ‘ 70 or beyond ’			0
the state pension age is already rising to 66 for both men and women by 2020 , rising again to 67 in 2028 and will continue to rise as life expectancy increases .			0
