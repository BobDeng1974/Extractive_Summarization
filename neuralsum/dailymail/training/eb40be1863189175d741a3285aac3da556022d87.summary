@entity0 believes @entity1 can shock @entity4 winners @entity2 in @entity5 on sunday night and secure the country ’s greatest result in a generation			1
the recent history of the national team has featured fine home and away wins over @entity12 under @entity13 and then @entity14 in the @entity16 qualification stage			1
under @entity17 , a @entity19 play - off victory over @entity20 was achieved at @entity21 in 2003 , before a crushing 6 - 0 reverse in @entity23			1
challenge : a win against @entity2 would be @entity1 's biggest in over a decade in @entity0 's eyes champions : @entity2 were comfortably the best side in @entity30 where they won the @entity4 this summer given @entity2 are fresh from winning the @entity4 in @entity30 in such scintillating fashion , however , @entity0 believes that for @entity1 to return with three points from their opening @entity35 qualifier would arguably represent the nation ’s finest result since beating @entity38 1 - 0 at @entity39 in 1999 in a @entity40 play - off second leg			1
the @entity43 winger said : ‘ it would be as big a result as this group has had			2
it may be similar to when we beat @entity12 and they were flying at the time ( losing the 2006 world cup final on penalties to @entity53 )			2
i also remember that play - off game against @entity20 in 2003 — that was a huge result at the time , too			2
‘ but being away from home against the @entity58 makes it even harder for us			2
‘ so i think , if it happens , it would be as big a result as the team has managed in the last 15 years			0
’ decisive : @entity64 scores the winning goal in the @entity4 final against @entity67 improving : @entity1 's form under @entity69 has been a significant improvement on recent years @entity35 sees the tournament enlarged from 16 to 24 teams , thanks to a proposal spearheaded by the late former @entity75 chief executive @entity74			1
the new - look qualifying process sees the nine group winners , nine runners - up and the best - finishing third team qualify automatically alongside hosts @entity12			0
the remaining third - placed teams play - off for the four remaining slots at the tournament			1
and @entity0 feels when you factor in that plus the national team ’s form under @entity69 over the past 12 months , @entity1 have never had a better chance to reach a major finals and end their exile since last appearing at the @entity12 ’ 98 @entity4			1
‘ is this our best chance yet ? yes , ’ he said			0
‘ i think coming into the qualifying matches our form is as good as we could have hoped for , really			0
there were moments under @entity13 and @entity14 when we came very close to qualification			0
' @entity98 result ' : a win against the @entity58 would eclipse anything @entity1 have achieved recently right time : with an expanded tournament @entity1 know it 's now or never for major tournament qualification ‘ that was an opportunity missed			1
but the form we are in now , considering where we were before , is very good			0
‘ losing to @entity108 at home ( in the @entity4 qualifiers in march 2013 ) in terms of how we got beaten was a real low point			0
‘ but the way we ’ve come on since then and across the whole last 12 months in particular , we could n’t really ask for much more ( ahead of the new campaign )			0

@entity1 face @entity117 in @entity35 qualifier
@entity1 have *n't* qualified for a major tournament since 1998
@entity0 believes @entity69 's side can shock @entity123
