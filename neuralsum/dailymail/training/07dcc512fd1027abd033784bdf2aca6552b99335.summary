by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:10 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 19:14 est , 23 august 2012 soaring numbers of men and women are having ‘ last - resort ’ weight - loss surgery on the @entity6 , costing taxpayers up to £ 85million a year			1
official figures reveal the number of gastric bypass operations on the @entity12 has risen sixfold in just five years			1
the operation , which costs up to £ 15,000 , was carried out 5,407 times last year , compared to 858 procedures in 2006/07			2
gastric operations should be the last resort , said health minister @entity16 , but numbers are rising gastric band surgery , which is cheaper but less effective , is also being increasingly used			1
some 1,316 operations were carried out in @entity22 in 2011/12 – twice as many as five years earlier , figures from the @entity20 show			2
many more operations would have been paid for @entity25 bypass operations typically cost the @entity12 between £ 8,000 and £ 14,000 per patient , while banding costs £ 5,000 to £ 7,000 , meaning the @entity12 spent up to £ 85million on the operations last year			1
experts attribute the rise to a greater acceptance of the safety and effectiveness of weight - loss surgery , and to growing numbers of people becoming hugely overweight			0
@entity12 guidelines say patients must have tried all other weight - loss methods and be dangerously obese , with a @entity39 , or body mass index , of 40 - plus			2
to have a @entity39 of 40 , a woman who is 5ft 4in would have to weigh just over 17 stone			0
dr @entity43 , chairman of the @entity44 , said : ‘ the gastric bypass is among the clinically effective and cost - effective procedures in the whole field of medicine and even the most cynical , fat - phobic taxpayer should welcome the rise			2
’ but @entity51 , co-founder of @entity52 , a group that provides free , healthy - lifestyle programmes for families , said : ‘ it is extremely concerning to see the number of gastric bypass operations taking place in @entity22 is continuing to dramatically increase			1
' it ’s important that families get the help and support they need early on before their obesity reaches the severe stage			0
’ previous research from @entity65 suggest numbers have risen because more obese patients are aware surgery can help them			0
the @entity69 and @entity70 ( @entity71 ) said gastric bypass operations had proven to be the most effective surgery to ensure long - term weight loss			1
the society has now called on the @entity76 to guarantee patients have equal access to the treatment			0
@entity79 weight - loss operations , sometimes called ' bariatric surgery ' , work by restricting the amount of nutrients that can be digested and absorbed by the intestine			2
gastric banding involves reducing the size of the stomach with a band fitted around it , while a gastric bypass re-routes food to a small stomach pouch created by surgeons			1
a third , less frequently used procedure , removes a portion of the stomach			0
the figures for @entity12 hospitals in @entity22 show a total of 18,577 gastric bypass and 7,650 gastric band operations were carried out between april 2006 and march 2012			1
there were 433 surgical procedures to remove gastric bands over the same period			2
@entity12 figures also show 4,581 gastric band maintenance operations were completed between april 2009 and march 2012			1
weight loss after a gastric bypass is usually more impressive than after a gastric band , according to the @entity12 website			1
most people with a gastric band will lose around half their excess body weight , whereas the majority of patients with a gastric bypass will lose around two - thirds of the excess body weight			1
the risk of any sort of complication after a gastric band is around one in 10 compared to one in five for a gastric bypass			1
the risk of death shortly after a gastric band is around one in 200 compared to one in 100 for a gastric bypass			1
weight loss surgery patients are required to take nutritional supplements for the rest of their lives following a gastric bypass procedure			2
@entity71 president @entity134 said : ' there is compelling evidence that weight - loss surgery to treat the most severely affected is one of the most clinically effective , safe and cost effective treatments available			0
' there are about 1.5 million such adults in the @entity142			0
they face premature death , disease and disability brought on as a direct result of their condition			0
' these can be prevented , improved or eliminated by surgery			0
while the increase in bariatric surgery is welcomed by the @entity71 and the @entity154 , we remain concerned that there is unequal access to treatment across the @entity142			0
' we therefore call on the @entity76 to invest in a long term strategy to ensure that all patients have equal access to this life - saving treatment			0
' mr @entity134 added : ' evidence suggests that gastric bypass operations may be more effective in the long - term			1
it also has also been shown to bring about a direct and immediate improvement in patients with type 2 diabetes , in addition to the benefits of weight loss			0
' health minister @entity16 said : ' we want people to live healthier lives so they do not need to resort to surgery , but as a last resort , doctors can advise procedures like these are undertaken			0
' we are working with charities , local government and industry to make it easier for people to make better choices to prevent obesity in the first place			0
' this year a third of meals and takeaways served from popular high street chains will contain calorie information and over a million families are involved in our @entity195 campaign - helping people to eat well and move more			0
' serious surgery : these is a 1 in 100 risk that a patient will die soon after having a gastric bypass			1

18,577 gastric bypass and 7,650 gastric band operations were carried out between april 2006 and march 2012
@entity12 spent up to £ *81million* on gastric bypasses and up to £ *10.5million* on gastric bands last year
risk of complications are 1 in five for bypasses and 1 in 10 for bands
