a super-spicy burger on sale in @entity2 is being touted as the hottest in @entity3 - after five people landed in hospital attempting to eat it			1
@entity7 , who serves the @entity8 in his restaurant in the popular seaside town , asks customers - who must be over- 18 - to sign a legal disclaimer before trying it			1
the dish has a chilli sauce on it measuring an eye - watering 9.2million on the @entity19 scale which measures spicy heat in foods - compared to an average chilli pepper at 500 scoville units			1
spicy challenge : the @entity8 is only on sale at @entity27 in @entity2 to over 18s on one occasion , a diner was taken to hospital with a suspected perforated bowel after eating the dish			1
four others were admitted for treatment on the same night for suspected anaphylactic shock			2
now diners who want to eat the xxx burger are asked to sign a document first drawn up by @entity7 saying : ' i the undersigned accept all responsibility for any effects incured ( sic ) due to the consumtion ( sic ) of the above mentioned xxxx @entity8 and release @entity27 , its owner and staff from any liability			2
' the dish is sold at his @entity27 restaurant in @entity2 , @entity52 , said : ' i am amazed i am allowed to sell it - but it 's been a massive hit with the customers			1
' i have spoken to people at environmental health but they think it is hilarious			1
@entity60 came in and i tried to convince the guy to have one but he would n't have it			2
" i have to admit i 've not dared to try one of these burgers myself as they are so spicy			2
one night five ambulances arrived and i 've heard the local hospital had people on crash mats on adrenalin drips from my chilli burger			1
@entity27 : takeaway boss @entity7 preparing his new super-spicy burger ' obviously i always take my responsibilities as a food retailer seriously but if my customers want super spicy food , i am entitled to give them what they want			0
the burgers are cooked properly - it 's the sauce that is maybe too hot to handle			1
' one of my customers works at the local hospital and they came down to tell me that staff held a two hour meeting about my chilli burger and that they are changing how they treat " the fallen "			1
' they 've now decided that an adrenalin drip is more effective for dealing with the anaphylactic shock that the burger sometimes brings on			0
' why the customers eat it i do n't know , because i always say to them that it is incredibly hot and give them all the health warnings under the sun. ' i think these people are slightly mad to eat it but i 'm sure there is a certain level of peer pressure			1
a lot of people just regard it as a challenge			1
' the burger gets its heat from a red - hot sauce based on a piri piri chilli concentrate created through steaming and is later infused with carbon dioxide			1
legal waiver : @entity7 wo n't allow anyone to try the spicy burger without signing a legal disclaimer so far just 59 out of 3,000 challengers have succeeded in eating the whole burger			1
the dish , sold at Â£ 3.90 , is said to have caused customers to adopt a number of undignified coping mechanisms from stripping naked , begging for mercy , punching windows and vomiting			0
many suffer from anaphylactic shock , a severe allergic reaction , can be brought on by certain foods , medication or animal stings and can leave the sufferer with swelling , rashes and difficulty breathing			0
@entity7 said : ' you get used to it			0
unlike most man vs food challenges , here at @entity8 off you do n't get a reward			0
' one guy came in and he was just a little bit cocky and when he left he was admitted to hospital because prior to eating the burger he had a stomach ulcer and we believe it perforated his bowel			1
' he was n't in a good way but he pulled through			0
' the first time someone had the burger and could n't take the heat it was a bit of a shock but we thought ' well we told you			0
' we never call an ambulance , it 's always the customer who calls			0
' hot sauce : the @entity154 sauce measures an eye - watering 9.2million on the @entity19 scale customers willing to try the @entity154 vary in age from young men to parents attempting to show their kids how it is done , however @entity27 also offer a cocktail stick sample for those more timid customers			1
he added : ' people always ask where i get the sauce from but i always say " if i tell you i will have to kill you			2
" i just got fed up with people saying " well it 's not really that hot "			2
' so i thought , well let 's make it hotter			2
now it 's got a bit of a following from people travelling for miles to challenge a friend or themselves			2
' we are n't one of these gourmet burger places			0
but it seems to work as we are usually always busy			0
' many of the foolhardy conquerors have taken to @entity187 and the burger off facebook page to spread the word about the burger			0
even former @entity191 star @entity191 attempted the challenge only to end up writhing on the pavement			0
@entity194 posted : ' my brother had heard all these bold statements beforehand about how he went to @entity198 and @entity199 and demanded their hottest possible curry and it barely made him break a sweat			0
' he got two bites into @entity205 and gave up			0
then spent two days recovering			0
' one @entity207 user said : ' sadly i can confirm that this @entity208 is no joke			1

@entity208 is 9.2million @entity19 units - *18,000* times hotter than a chilli pepper
five people have been hospitalised after eating the @entity154
