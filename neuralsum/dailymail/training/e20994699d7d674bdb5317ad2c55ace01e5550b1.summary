at the time it was reported as a moment of triumph , an early success in a campaign to suppress a communist - backed insurgency rising up against @entity7 colonial rule			1
but the killing of 24 @entity10 villagers by a patrol of the @entity12 guards 64 years ago is one of the most controversial episodes in @entity7 imperial history - and it could soon be investigated in an official inquiry			1
next month , lawyers for the victims ' families will present new evidence in a @entity22 court , claiming the villagers were murdered in cold blood and that the truth about the killings has been covered up ever since			1
they say a full investigation has never been carried out into the incident , which has been described as ' @entity7 's @entity29 ' , a reference to the killing of @entity32 villagers by @entity34 forces during the @entity35			1
emergency : at the time of the killings , @entity7 forces were trying to quell a growing communist rebellion which mainly involved @entity10 insurgents the case centres on an incident in december 1948 at the height of the @entity45 , the insurgency against @entity7 colonial rule in what is now @entity48			1
the dead were @entity10 labourers working in @entity50 , a rubber plantation north of @entity52 , but colonial authorities at the time claimed they were suspected terrorists killed while trying to escape			1
that claim is likely to be challenged on may 8 when law firm @entity57 brings the lawsuit in the divisional court			2
new evidence to be presented at the hearing is expected to include information gathered during a @entity48 police inquiry carried out in the 1990s			2
details from the police investigation were obtained by @entity66 and @entity67 , authors of a book about the killings , entitled @entity71 and deception at @entity50			2
although a number of the @entity75 involved in the incident are still alive , the victims ' families are not expected to seek criminal prosecutions			0
but the solicitor leading the case , @entity80 , told @entity81 : ' there is an overwhelming case for a proper investigation , along with an immediate apology and reparation			0
' the @entity50 killings have been compared with the @entity29 , which prompted outrage over the @entity90 campaign in @entity91 at the time of the killings , @entity7 forces were trying to quell a growing communist rebellion which mainly involved @entity10 insurgents			1
three @entity7 soldiers had been burnt alive by insurgents a few days before , and there were reports of ' bandit ' activity in the @entity50 area			0
a 16 - strong unit of @entity103 responded on december 11 , surrounding the rubber estate at @entity105 , close to the @entity50 river			1
the @entity10 men were separated from women and children			1
one man was shot that night , the remaining 23 the next day			0
a few of the bodies were mutilated , according to some reports			0
the village was burnt after the women and children were taken away			0
no weapons were found and the leader of the @entity119 , @entity120 , has said that none of the villagers was linked to the insurgency			2
the case follows legal action taken against the @entity126 last year by a group of @entity128 who claim they were tortured during the @entity129 , which ran from 1952 to 1960			0
the @entity29 , to which the @entity50 killings have been compared , was one of the most notorious incidents of the @entity35			1
up to 500 unarmed civilians were killed by @entity34 soldiers during the episode in @entity91 on march 16 , 1968			1
most of the women were children or elderly , and some of the bodies were later found to be mutilated			0
details only came to light publicly in 1969 , prompting widespread outrage and fuelling opposition to the war			0
twenty - six soldiers were charged with criminal offences over @entity29 , but only one was convicted - platoon leader second lieutenant @entity147			1
@entity147 was found guilty of killing 22 villagers and was initially handed a life service , but he served only three and a half years under house arrest			2
the @entity129 lawsuit , which is expected to come to court in july , led to the discovery of colonial - era documents in secret @entity126 archives in @entity157			2
the government has begun releasing sensitive documents removed from the colonies before independence and the first batch , provided last week , included papers relating to the @entity45			1
however , the files on @entity50 are missing			0
the @entity75 were cleared by a brief investigation into @entity50 carried out in 1949 , which found the killings were ' a bona fide mistake '			2
but some of those involved in the inquiry later claimed they gave false evidence to ensure the soldiers were not blamed			0
a second inquiry began in 1970 , only to be shelved by the incoming @entity174 government			0
in the same year , the @entity176 newspaper quoted one of the soldiers as saying : ' once we started firing we seemed to go mad ... i remember the water turning red with their blood			0
' the incident again came under scrutiny in 1992 with a @entity187 documentary , but the @entity126 insisted no fresh evidence had been uncovered to justify another inquiry			0
last september , the @entity190 ordered a full hearing into the case			0
painful history : up to 500 unarmed civilians were killed in the @entity32 village of @entity29			1

@entity103 patrol killed 24 @entity10 villagers in the *jungle* during the @entity45 in 1948
killings compared to @entity34 *massacre* of civilians in @entity29 during @entity35
