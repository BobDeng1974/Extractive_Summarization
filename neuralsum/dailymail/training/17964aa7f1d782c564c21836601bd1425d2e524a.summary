@entity0 believes his monastic lifestyle has helped him shut out his growing celebrity status and focus on becoming a world champion			1
the undefeated heavyweight marks the first anniversary of his professional career on saturday night when he takes on @entity7 for his first title , the @entity10 belt			1
but @entity0 refuses to be distracted by the inevitable hype that has accompanied his first eight fights			1
@entity0 and @entity7 weigh in ahead of their heavyweight clash on saturday @entity0 returns to the @entity15 a year after making his debut at the same venue @entity0 stopped @entity18 in the second round of their fight in @entity22 next month @entity0 has also boxed at @entity23 in his first year as a professional , stopping @entity24 in the first round ' not much has changed , ' he said			1
' i 've got a lot more fans now that 's for sure as i have boxed around the country , but i have been in the gym so i have n't been able to see the impact , it 's a basic lifestyle really , ' because i am boxing so much , the turnaround is short			1
@entity35 said what has kept him in the game for so long is avoiding the celebrity lifestyle – that 's what i need to do			1
i have n't had time to have a holiday , i would like to do that , eat some nice food in some tiny restaurants but i have n't been able to			1
' i am aware of the expectations around me and the potential that the great guys achieved			2
i 'm at the start of my career like they all were and i know that hard work is the key			2
if i keep my head down and work hard i can reach the top			2
' i have improved , i am fitter and i understand more			2
right now i am that @entity57 level really – i learn how to deal with the event but training is 50 times harder than the fight			2
@entity7 ( right ) is expected to provide @entity0 's toughest test as a professional on sunday ' i keep the blinkers on			1
it 's what i signed up for , i know that if things go well next week then there will be more interested			0
i understand the pressure that comes with it but when you are winning there 's no stopping you , my motto is to stay hungry and it 's that simple			0
' as an amateur i worked with sports psychologists and i have read books on it			0
everyone has their level and i have n't found it as a pro. even if i just achieve @entity82 level , as long as i give it 110 per cent then i am happy with that			0
i have n't brought into it yet as i have n't achieved it yet			0
i have the contender mentality and i am very self - critical			0
' @entity7 is a lot busier than my last opponent			1
i look at him the same as i looked at @entity24 , one of my previous opponents , just with a lot more experience			0
@entity24 came out with a lot of hooks and gave it a go			0
@entity7 can take punches for fun , and he 'll be looking to get to me			1
hopefully , he 'll be the one eating a lot of shots			0
i have to get the win really			0
