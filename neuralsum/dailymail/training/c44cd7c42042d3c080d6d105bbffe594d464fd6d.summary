by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 25 january 2013 hardly a role model : @entity2 as her character @entity4 in the television show @entity3 @entity4 is the last woman you would expect – or indeed want – to dispense motherly advice , particularly when it comes to alcohol			1
but @entity2 , who plays the perennially drunk absolutely fabulous character , is more than happy to dole out wisdom to the younger generation			1
miss @entity2 , 66 , yesterday urged young women to stop behaving badly and take more responsibility for their actions , warning them that binge drinking and dressing ‘ like trash ’ made them vulnerable			1
she said : ‘ i promise you it is better to look after yourself properly , which means behave properly , be polite , be on time , dress properly – i do n’t mean dully – but do n’t be sick in the gutter at midnight in a silly dress with no money to get a taxi home , because somebody will take advantage of you , either they ’ll rape you , or they ’ll knock you on the head or they ’ll rob you			2
‘ do n’t look like trash , do n’t get drunk , do n’t be sick down your front , do n’t break your heels and stagger about in the wrong clothes at midnight			0
‘ it ’s not me being a snob about it			0
it ’s not me being an old woman talking to young women , it ’s just standard practice for how our species should behave			0
’ miss @entity2 said she had never got so drunk that she wandered the streets at night looking dishevelled and without knowing how to get home			1
but she conceded there was now ‘ something in our society ’ which caused young women to behave badly			0
‘ it could be to keep up the laddish thing which makes you look funkier , ’ she said			0
the actress added that she did not approve of raucous behaviour in boys either , but that girls were more vulnerable and had to be aware of ‘ predators ’			0
she added : ‘ girls used not to get legless and now they do , and so i think that ’s a trend which we should pull back from			0
’ miss @entity2 , who in recent years has become known for her charity and human rights work , gave her advice as she backed a @entity68 campaign to encourage people to donate their old clothes each time they buy new ones			1
she added that women often fail to dress appropriately – and usually buy clothes a size too small			2
‘ i think often it ’s about wearing the wrong size or the wrong age and i ’m very guilty of this myself , ’ she said			0
‘ i often wear things that are clearly mutton dressed as lamb and i go “ why have i got this ? why am i even holding this ? ”			0
’ a storm is brewing on @entity84 where users have said the star 's comments reveal ' depressing ignorance			1
' they say that rapists must must be held accountable for their actions - and it is downright dangerous for anyone to suggest that a woman could avoid a rape by dressing in a conservative manner			1
one , calling herself @entity98 , said : ' @entity2 seems to think alcohol rapes people			1
no , rapists rape people			1
' another says : ' rape is an act of violence , not sex			0
to suggest women could avoid rape by drinking less or wearing different clothes is ignorant and insulting			1
' not so @entity3 : @entity2 says she ' detests ' @entity4 , the drunken character she plays in the hit comedy @entity3 @entity112 of the @entity113 says : ' such comments frighteningly normalise " victim blaming "			2
they re-allocate blame from the perpetrator to the victim			0
' it is horrifying that ms @entity2 would claim that " something in our society " has caused young women to behave badly ; the focus here is entirely upon the women who have experienced rape and other forms of violence at the hands of male perpetrators , as opposed to condemning a society which breeds male rapists			1
' if ms @entity2 were to understand the statistics around rape , she would know that the overwhelming majority of rapes are perpetrated by someone the woman already knows , rather than on the street			1
' would she contend that those women ' behave badly ' and wear the ' wrong clothes ' and are therefore to blame at the hands of men they know and have trusted ? ' the problem is not that of female " vulnerability " but of a " macho culture " which produces the notion of male entitlement – a culture which consistently fails women through disbelief , victim blaming and failure to investigate			2
' vulnerable : girls need to be aware of predators , @entity2 says			2
' do n't break your heels and stagger around in the wrong clothes at midnight , this is bad , ' she adds the charity rape crisis has dedicated a page of its website to dispelling myths surrounding rape			1
two of the main myths repeated time and time again regarding sexual violence towards women are that a ) women are ' asking for it ' if they dress a certain way , and b ) that they are more likely to be raped if they are out at night			1
they say : ' the suggestion of avoiding walking alone , especially at night is a common suggestion to avoiding sexual assault			0
however , only 9 % of rapes are committed by ' strangers '			0
women are raped in their homes and in their work places where they are less likely to be believed and even less likely to report			2
this myth can control movements and restricts freedom			0
this can feel like women are living under a ' curfew ' and that it is a woman 's responsibility to be either in or out at certain times			1
more than 80 % of rapes are committed by known men			0
regarding dress and appearance : ' rape is an act of violence not sex			2
women and girls of all ages , classes , culture , ability , sexuality , race and faith are raped			2
there is a great diversity in the way targeted women act or dress			2
rapists choose women based on their vulnerability not their physical appearance			2
' @entity2 's comments have reignited a topic that hit the headlines in 2011 when a @entity223 policeman caused an outcry by telling a group of students that women should ' avoid dressing like sluts ' in order to avoid being sexually assaulted			1
a controversial movement named ' @entity231 ' was launched in response to the policeman 's condemnation of women and saw protest marches held in @entity237 , @entity238 and other major cities where women took to the streets in revealing clothing to challenge the notion that women are ever to blame for the sexual violence of men			1
in september last year , the semi-naked protestors converged outside @entity248 to demand justice for rape victims and petition @entity251 to ensure the criminal justice system takes rape and sexual assault cases more seriously			0
i like @entity2 but it saddens me that her advice for girls is how not to get raped rather than telling boys not to rape in first place @ @entity262 yeah staggering about p * * * * * up with no clothes on is n't a good move , but it should n't warrant rape / assult @ @entity268 , i 'm so disappointed in your misguided rape @entity271 ‏ @entity2 seems to think alcohol rapes people			1
no , rapists rape people			1
@ londonfeminist @entity275 , @entity2 needs to @entity276			0
this is a woman who smokes / starves herself to stay thin , and who 's now acting the rape apologist			0
@ @entity281 sad to see @entity2 joining the illustrious band of victim blaming rape apologists … @ @entity285 advising women to ' dress appropriately ' is so @entity288			1
rape existed long before the @entity290 was invented			0
@ @entity291 oh @entity2 how disappointing			0
nobody has the right to rape you no matter what you wear or what time you are out at night			0
@ @entity297 joining the ranks of @entity299 & other meddlesome , ignorant celebs			0
leave our bodies alone # @entity303 @ @entity304 @entity2 ' girls who get legless in a silly dress ' risking # rape @entity275 damn @entity4 ! @ @entity308			1

@entity2 sparks outrage as she says women should dress demurely at night to avoid being ' raped or robbed '
actress 's advice contradicts *message* from rape crisis centres who say the way women dress is never to blame for rape
rape charity says women should not be forced to ' live under curfew '
@entity84 responds : ' @entity2 , alcohol does n't rape people , rapists do '
