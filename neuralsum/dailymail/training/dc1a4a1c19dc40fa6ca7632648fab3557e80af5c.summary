the serpent , estimated to be at least 17 feet , is seen moving away from the tiny boat , its belly appearing full of what must have been a massive lunch not long earlier			1
then @entity17 begins to prod the anaconda with a wooden oar as the snake attempts to get away from him			2
the snake gets away momentarily , swimming away from the group for a few seconds before the boat turns around and continues to chase it			2
' grab it , dude , grab it ! ' instigate @entity17 as his buddy @entity18 tries to catch the snake by its tail			0
then @entity17 gets over to the boat control — and brazenly begins to take off as @entity18 holds on to the snake , pulling the huge animal as it thrashes around trying to get away			2
