@entity0 arrived in @entity1 to much fanfare after completing a loan move to @entity4 during the summer			1
however , with injury limiting him to just 12 @entity7 appearances , @entity0 has struggled for form and managed just three goals			1
@entity4 blogger @entity10 , who contributes to @entity11 , discusses why manager @entity12 should steer clear of securing @entity0 on a permanent deal			1
@entity0 , pictured against @entity14 , is still fighting to prove himself in the @entity7 with @entity4 we ’ve all learned by now that football ’s transfer market can be an expensive , hit - or - miss business			1
with so much attention and pressure on today ’s leading @entity7 stars , many have and will continue to falter under the expectation			0
the latest man under the spotlight - who is still fighting to prove himself in the @entity7 - is @entity4 striker @entity0			1
and it ’s a battle he ’s currently losing , much to the disappointment of @entity4 fans			2
@entity0 , who is on loan from @entity30 , has scored three league goals and largely struggled for the @entity32 when news broke that the @entity35 had signed last summer , supporters could have been excused spells of giddiness			1
the prospect of the former @entity30 forward lining up alongside @entity39 and @entity40 was the stuff of dreams			2
with @entity44 making his way to @entity46 just a week before , you ’d have been forgiven for thinking @entity12 was creating the @entity7 ’s version of @entity49 ’s ‘ @entity48 ’			0
the ‘ @entity51 ’ , they were christened			0
doubt even crept in regarding how each player would fit in , with £ 37million man @entity54 not even guaranteed a place in the starting @entity56 despite only signing eight months before			0
@entity0 and @entity44 ( pictured ) were christened the ' @entity51 ' at @entity57 @entity4 forward @entity54 is not guaranteed a place in the @entity4 starting xi the arrivals were an important statement , a message to the footballing world that the old @entity4 were back			1
the @entity64 debacle of the previous season was firmly put behind them			0
inevitably with big - name acquisitions , it means big money			0
with @entity71 , @entity54 and @entity0 , it was no different			2
the two midfielders have gone some way to justifying their astronomical fees - @entity54 ’s goal and assist record is respectable , whilst @entity71 ’s style of play is something @entity4 have missed since the days of @entity80			2
the @entity82 ’s pace and directness will pay off			0
but in @entity0 , heavy doubt remains			2
since joining he ’s looked a shell of the player that once destroyed @entity89 with a four - goal @entity91 final haul			0
of course , @entity0 ’s struggles with injury have had a huge bearing on the impact he ’s made but three goals in over 650 minutes of football is n’t good enough for one of the world ’s deadliest finishers , no matter which way you look at it			1
doubt amongst @entity4 fans remains as to whether @entity0 will be a success at @entity57 @entity0 - especially recently - has been given first - team opportunities and shown little aptitude in terms of taking them			1
his first touch is often disastrous and while his ‘ fox - in - the - box ’ instincts do n’t seem to have deserted him , @entity4 need a forward who will offer more in their build - up play			0
given it will cost them around £ 40m to keep the player beyond this season - and throwing in to the mix the fact that @entity0 turns 29 next month - it makes such an expensive transfer seem wildly unjustifiable			1
@entity4 deserve some credit in terms of the deal they initially agreed with @entity30 , covering their own backs with a short - term commitment in spite of the mind - boggling £ 265,000 he is paid each week			1
but their foresight will be meaningless should they go on to complete a permanent transfer - the second most expensive in the club ’s history - for a player who has done little to prove he is anywhere near as good as he used to be and with ongoing injury problems			0
it ’s a risk not worth taking in my eyes			0
