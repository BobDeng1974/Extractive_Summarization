he knew she was my life			0
you do n't take the love from someone you love surely ? ' she said			0

' deceived : @entity28 's grandmother @entity7 insisted that the true nature of @entity2 came as a total surprise as she thought she knew the real him , but now says he is ' worse than @entity4 ' but ms @entity7 's faith was never repaid as last august he murdered the 12 - year - olf schoolgirl in the most depraved way , and the man she now says is ' rotten to the core ' was jailed for 38 years without parole yesterday			1
' i thought i knew the real @entity16 , ' she told the @entity98 , ' i thought i could see a loving , gentle caring man who ’d gone astray but wanted to change his ways			2
' i actually felt sorry for him because i thought his terrible childhood had scarred him and that was the reason he turned to crime , drinking and drugs			0
' he told me he ’d never had a normal home life – so i gave him that			2
he had a ready - made family … and a granddaughter he appeared to dote on			2
' he used to talk to me about his childhood and cry like a baby			0
it would usually happen when he ’d done something wrong , and he wanted sympathy , ' she said			0
' but now i know nothing would have changed that man – and he ca n’t blame his actions on what others did to him			1
he was rotten to the core			1

she had a brief fling with @entity27 around a decade ago in february 2010 he was convicted for possessing a machete and went to prison for a year , but his loyal partner stood by him after he told her ' you ’re the most important thing in my life			1
' @entity2 was said to ' idolise ' the man she had known since the age of seven and became known as his ' clingon			2
' but @entity27 became sexually obsessed with the young girl and on three nights in july 2012 filmed her sleeping at his home			1

scene : police sniffer dogs leaving @entity2 's grandmother 's house in @entity199 , where @entity27 suffocated her while he was babysitting @entity27 's obsession also led to him searching for indecent images of children who wore glasses like @entity28			1
it is thought vodka - fuelled @entity27 attempted to sexually assault @entity28 in the early hours of the morning			1
@entity28 , described by @entity7 as ' not the sort of girl you could groom ' , must have fought back before being suffocated by @entity27 using her own duvet			1
