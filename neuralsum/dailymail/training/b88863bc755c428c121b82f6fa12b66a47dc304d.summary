@entity0 was presented with the ‘ golden cap ’ by fellow @entity3 centurion sir @entity2 at @entity4 in front of 80,000 fans on saturday			1
with @entity3 ’s under - 21s side looking impressive in their 3 - 1 victory over @entity10 on thursday , @entity7 looks at four players who could follow in @entity0 ’s footsteps			1
@entity13 called up by @entity14 for the @entity16 qualifier against @entity17 and friendly against @entity18			0
@entity13 is set to win his first cap next week , but can he emulate the likes of @entity0 ? @entity13 has been impressive at youth level , and could become the first refugee to play for @entity3 he has scored seven goals in the @entity27 for @entity28 this season , only @entity25 ( 8 ) , @entity23 ( 10 ) and @entity24 ( 12 ) have scored more			1
the 21 year - old is also the top - scorer in the @entity33 - 21 2015 @entity32 qualifying campaign with eight goals			2
the @entity28 academy graduate initially struggled going out on loan to @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , but since returning to the @entity41 the energetic striker has found his feet in the @entity27			0
the @entity28 striker has scored seven times already this season , including against @entity45 after reported interest from @entity47 @entity28 decided to open fresh contract talks with the much sought - after youngster			2
he only signed a new four - year extension with the club in december 2013			2
likely to make his international debut on tuesday against @entity18 at @entity54			0
@entity55 @entity57 ' most impressive player in a so - far disappointing transition under @entity59			2
despite being the joint - top scorer in this season ’s @entity61 with five goals he has only started one game in the league to the annoyance and bemusement of many of @entity57 ' fans			0
@entity55 has scored six times for the @entity71 , and @entity14 has hinted at a full cap not being far away @entity55 has been a bright spot during a disappointing start to this season at @entity76 the @entity78 club have lost four out of five home games this season , while @entity55 has warmed the bench , but his performances in @entity83 have given the indication that he could be the man to provide the lethal touch that @entity59 and the club badly need			0
a product of the @entity57 ’s academy @entity55 has represented @entity3 at every youth level , scoring 6 goals in 9 appearances for the under - 21s , but is yet to make an appearance for the senior side			1
@entity95 scored 21 goals in the @entity32 last season as part of @entity100 ’s promotion to the @entity27 subsequently winning 2013 - 14 @entity101			0
has scored just once in the @entity27 this season , but netted twice in @entity3 ’s @entity33 - 21 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity10 on thursday evening at his home - ground @entity104			1
@entity95 ' form in the last season attracted attention , and he has shown international potential the 22 year - old former @entity112 man has four goals in six under - 21 appearances , mainly down to his physical presence in and around the box			0
@entity100 ’s next three games against @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 could see him improve his top - flight tally			0
@entity122 @entity124 ’s exciting young prospect has experienced @entity126 environments for the last three seasons playing on - loan at @entity128 , @entity129 and this season for @entity131			0
played once for the @entity133 under - 18s , before switching allegiance to play for @entity3			1
since 2010 he has playing for the under - 18s , 19s and 21s , making his under - 21 debut in november 2013 as a substitute against @entity140			1
@entity122 is exceptionally highly thought of at @entity124 , and could be an @entity3 star of the future @entity122 once represented the @entity133 at youth level , but is now fully committed to @entity3 in his spells at @entity129 and now @entity131 the young @entity124 striker has shown a killer instinct considered by some of @entity124 ’s coaching staff to be the next thing , he has certainly impressed with his consistent performances and goalscoring in the @entity32 and @entity152 .			1

@entity0 made his @entity3 debut at 17 in 2003 against @entity155
became the ninth @entity3 player to reach 100 caps on saturday
a quartet of under - 21s strikers could be the future of @entity164 *football*
