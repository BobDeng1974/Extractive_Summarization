by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 former @entity3 striker @entity2 believes the club 's failure to sign players early in the summer could cost them money as the transfer window draws to a close			1
@entity3 have only signed two players since the end of last season - @entity12 and @entity13 - and lost their opening game of the season to @entity16			1
@entity2 believes @entity17 must add at least three or four new faces to his squad , even though players tend to cost more late in the window			2
leaving it late : @entity2 ( right ) believes @entity3 could end up spending more on players new boy : @entity12 is one of just two summer signings made by manager @entity17 he told @entity26 and @entity27 on @entity28 : ' the way to go in these situations is to do your business at the start of the window because it 's probably a little bit cheaper			1
' people know they 're going to be desperate now and there might be an extra zero going onto a price			0
it 's difficult for @entity3 because they did n't have a manager at the start of the transfer window			2
but it 's not too clever of them			0
down in the dumps : @entity46 trudges down the @entity48 tunnel after his side 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity16 ruled out : summer signing @entity13 ( second from left ) is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury ' everyone can see they need to reinvest , but not just reinvest in players , they need frontline players			1
they need players that are going to go straight into that team because they do n't need a huge squad			0
' they 've got numbers already and they 're not in @entity64 competition			0
so they need three or four players that are going to go straight into that starting @entity68 '			0

@entity2 believes clubs will *charges* *united* more for their players late in the transfer window
@entity17 has only signed @entity13 and @entity12 so far
the @entity76 began their season with a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity16
@entity2 says @entity3 must sign ' three or four ' new players to compete
