by @entity0 published : 23:24 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 23:26 est , 31 july 2012 when the confirmations finally came through , @entity1 and other market makers were left owning large amounts of unwanted @entity6 stock , which led to losses as the stock plunged			1
it also is unclear what role @entity1 's own trading system might have played in the losses or what action the company will take to recoup the $ 356million			1
' there may be limitations on recoveries @entity1 may receive , ' said former @entity18 lawyer @entity17 , a partner at @entity19 in @entity20			1
' that said , it is such a black eye for the @entity23 that they 're highly motivated in resolving all litigation before it spins further out of control			1
' @entity28 news : @entity30 bank @entity1 ceo @entity29 pictured addressing reporters tuesday ; @entity1 said its net profit shrank to $ 433million , hit by a slump in trading and a $ 536m loss on the glitch - ridden market debut of @entity6 down and out : hit by lower trading revenue and fewer commissions and client fees , @entity30 's largest bank said the 58 percent net profit drop reflects ' challenging conditions marked by increased volatility and greater client caution ' what went wrong at the heart of the problems was , by all accounts , a communication issue			1
for nearly 20 minutes on the morning @entity6 opened , a phone call that was supposed to keep traders informed was silent , with no information coming through			0
but on the line with the order desk at @entity23 , market makers were being told to keep sending orders			1
those should have been processed when @entity6 debuted			0
but once shares started trading , confirmations on many of those orders , usually delivered in milliseconds , never came			0
market makers later learned some orders were lost , and others were not processed at the open , but were filled hours later			0
market participants calling the exchange to find out what was going on said they encountered wait times of up to an hour -- if their calls were answered at all			0
that caused confusion about how many shares a market maker actually held , and led to some of the re-ordering that caused @entity1 's losses			1
worth the hype ? @entity6 founder @entity81 , center , applauded after ringing the opening bell on may 18 , the day of @entity6 's ipo when the order confirmations did not come back to @entity1 from @entity23 quickly , the systems designed to ensure customers get the best execution and proper trade execution -- something required by regulations governing firms like @entity1 -- were forced to scan the firm 's limit order books repeatedly in order to comply with regulations , said two sources with knowledge of the situation			1
overwhelmed by the order message backup , @entity1 's systems slowed even more , as did the systems at some other market makers , the sources said			1
adding to the problem , after @entity6 began trading , investors watched as the stock 's price dropped below its initial trading price			0
some wanted to cancel their orders completely or cancel and re-order at a better price			0
in many cases the original order to buy the shares still had not been processed by @entity23 , and appeared to have never gone through at all			1
at @entity1 , that sent its system into something akin to a repeat mode			1
sliding scale : @entity122 stocks have gone back and forth in the past few weeks glitch : a trader works on the floor of the @entity126 at the closing bell ; trading was delayed during @entity6 's may 18 ipo due to a now - infamous glitch ' because there still was no confirmation , @entity1 's system automatically re-sent the orders , ' said the source , who has knowledge of @entity1 's systems			2
several market participants said they tried in vain to get @entity23 to halt trading on @entity6 to fix the problem and called the @entity18 to make sure it knew the gravity of the situation			2
market makers said it was tough to comment without knowledge of @entity1 's systems and procedures			2
most agreed , nonetheless , that an order is deemed live until a cancellation or some sort of acknowledgement is received , or when it is executed or rejected			0
sending and resending an order that has not been acknowledged is not a standard procedure			0
regulators are now investigating the matter			0
high hopes : curious bystanders watched through the @entity23 windows as @entity6 shares begin trading may 18 in @entity20 liabilities capped ? liabilities at @entity122 exchanges are capped in most instances			2
@entity23 's cap is $ 3million and the compensation plan filed with the @entity18 is meant to increase that in this specific instance			1
but a legal source told @entity170 a firm could sue in the case of gross negligence			0
the question remains , though , whether @entity23 's actions were regulatory -- in which case it has some immunity -- or merely a failure to provide professional services			2
' @entity23 is going to want to say the delays , the screwups on the morning , were because of regulatory decisions to delay trading , disrupt trading , ' @entity180 , a securities law professor at @entity182 , said in an interview			2
' if they can convince the fact - finder these were regulatory decisions , then they can not be held liable			0
to the extent that @entity23 makes decisions in a regulatory capacity , it has immunity			2
@entity1 is going to say , ' you did not perform the service a professional is supposed to perform , ' and that 's malpractice			0

@entity1 lost $ 356 in the @entity202 and is now suing @entity23
@entity23 *interested* in resolving matter as quickly as possible
