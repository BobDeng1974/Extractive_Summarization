a blame game over the ‘ lacklustre ’ no campaign is under way before the votes have been cast in the @entity5 independence referendum			1
@entity6 was yesterday accused of ignoring warnings from senior officials about the chances of a @entity11 vote			2
there is also growing unease at @entity14 at the last - ditch offers being made to @entity5 to persuade it to stay in the @entity17			1
one senior mp said : ‘ it all smacks terribly of panic			2
worst of all , it ’s all being dictated by @entity34			2
’ a former minister said : ‘ it ’s crisis politics			0
this is the worst example but it ’s part of a pattern			0
the whole thing has been a total shambles			0
’ and conservative mp @entity42 became the first to suggest publicly that mr @entity6 might have to consider resigning in the event of a @entity11 vote			1
he said : ‘ i hope @entity5 vote to stay ; if it goes wrong ... the prime minister will have to decide what the honourable thing is to do			1
’ with frantic last - minute efforts being made to tell @entity5 that backing @entity53 is a positive vote for giving more powers to @entity56 , senior figures in all three main parties are saying privately that a third option of ‘ devo max ’ should have been offered			1
@entity5 ’s first minister , @entity59 , initially wanted a three - option ballot , but mr @entity6 insisted on a straightforward yes / no question			1
@entity59 had wanted a three - question ballot but @entity6 insisted upon a simple yes or no vote mr @entity59 won concessions , rejecting the argument that expat @entity5 should get a vote and insisting that 16 - and 17 - year - olds , seen as more likely to back independence , took part			1
princess @entity71 , right , caused speculation on a visit to @entity74 yesterday – by wearing the colours of the @entity76			0
dressed head to toe in white and blue , she opened a new wing of @entity80 , as part of her role as chancellor of the @entity84			0
she has not voiced her opinion on independence , but is known to adore @entity5 and often holidays there			1
in january 2012 , mr @entity6 said the referendum should take place ‘ sooner rather than later ’ , but mr @entity59 demanded it was put off until now			0
the prime minister sought to deflect criticism of his handling of the referendum , telling @entity96 ’s @entity95 on monday : ‘ i think it was right to have one question , because , of course , if @entity5 wants more devolution , and i think @entity5 wants more devolution , you have to answer the prior question : “ do you want to stay in the @entity17 ? ” ‘ of course , that was n’t just my view , that was the view of the leaders of other @entity17 parties who all thought it was important , let ’s settle the question of separation and then look at devolution			1
’ meanwhile , the @entity114 yesterday reported claims that senior civil servants attempted to raise the alarm about the risks of the break - up of the @entity17			0
cabinet secretary sir @entity120 and his predecessor , @entity121 , are both said to have warned that while mr @entity59 ’s sole focus for two years has been building support for independence , there was a danger that @entity14 would concentrate on other matters			2
some conservative backbenchers are angry that the plan to save the @entity130 is relying on @entity34 but a @entity132 source said it was ‘ complete and utter nonsense ’ to say that a no vote had been taken for granted , pointing out that mr @entity6 had made ten campaign visits to @entity5 and the @entity136 had published dozens of papers about the potential risks of separation			1
the @entity140 said it was ‘ simply not true ’ that sir @entity120 had given such warnings			0
labour leader @entity143 is also expected to face a leadership crisis in the event of a no vote			0
he agreed that the @entity148 campaign should be led by former chancellor @entity149 , parachuting in shadow foreign secretary @entity150 in the closing months amid concerns about its effectiveness			2
while more than 95 per cent of conservative voters in @entity5 are planning to vote no , working - class @entity156 voters are supporting independence in growing numbers			2
‘ there is a real battle going on for @entity156 votes , and it is down to @entity156 to win it , ’ said one @entity136 source			0
‘ it is up to @entity143 to deliver his voters			0

@entity168 backbenchers are concerned about the ' *shambolic* ' no campaign
@entity14 is *unhappy* over the last minute promises being made to @entity5
@entity168 mp @entity42 suggests @entity172 will consider position if @entity5 leave
