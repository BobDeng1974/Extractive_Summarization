it is being called the hardest rock climb on earth and for a while @entity4 's attempt to scale the sheer face of @entity7 's @entity6 was hanging from the fingertips - literally			1
but despite his torn and bleeding hands , @entity4 cleared one of the 3,000 ft ascents most difficult stretches , after days of failed attempts and waiting			1
crowds of onlookers at the foot of the @entity18 at @entity19 broke into tears and cheers as @entity4 , 30 , finally grasped a razor sharp hold that had eluded him for days , clipped an anchor to secure himself and then screamed out in triumph , according to those who witnessed the dramatic climb			1
" pure joy , " @entity4 wrote afterward on his @entity29 page , next to a photograph showing his bloody , bandaged hands			1
scroll down for @entity33 waiting : @entity34 is waiting for his colleague and climbing partner , @entity4 to join him for the final ascent of the arduous @entity6 climb in @entity39 hands torn and bleeding , the second of two men attempting a grueling climb up a half - mile of sheer granite in @entity39 's @entity45 cleared one of the ascent 's most difficult stretches after days of failed attempts and waiting friday 's climb keeps @entity4 in the effort , after @entity34 moved several segments ahead of him			1
@entity34 is now 2,000 feet up , about 1,000 feet from finishing			1
support crews have said they hope the two men will reach the top by mid-next week @entity4 , 30 , of @entity56 , @entity39 , and @entity34 , 36 , of @entity57 are two weeks into what is billed as the first free climb of the vertical @entity60 to reach the 3,000 - foot summit of @entity6			1
free climb means the men are climbing without the aid of pegs , ropes or other gear to help them ascend , although they are using safety gear to guard against what could be deadly falls			1
friday 's climb keeps @entity4 in the effort , after @entity34 moved several segments ahead of him			1
@entity34 is now 2,000 feet up , about 1,000 feet from finishing			1
support crews have said they hope the two men will reach the top by mid-next week			0
indeed , @entity34 is only 1,000 feet from finishing the groundbreaking climb			1
@entity4 and @entity34 are attempting to become the first men to free - climb - using only hands and feet - the @entity60 of the park 's towering @entity6 rock formation			1
on thursday , @entity34 climbed to a ledge 2,000 feet up , says @entity81 , a photographer and climber who has been chronicling the journey			1
his partner , however , is hundreds of feet below			2
this has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner , and led to the pair taking three ‘ rest days ’ in the hope the skin will heal			0
this weekend , after a short break , @entity4 plans to try surpassing the particularly difficult section lower down once more			1
@entity34 and @entity4 are relying completely on their physical strength and dexterity to make their way up the @entity18 , a vertical face on one side of @entity6			1
@entity34 could become the first to accomplish the feat. progress : @entity34 makes his way up the rock face last sunday			2
if all goes well , he could do it this weekend do n't look down : @entity4 calculates his next move up the mountain despite suffering cuts to his fingers the men have been climbing toward the 3,000 - foot summit for two weeks			1
speaking from the foot of the @entity18 at the start , @entity81 , a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair , told the @entity164 their spirits are still high			0
‘ they remain determined to complete the climb , ’ he says			2
‘ they are definitely going for the top			0
they say they are not coming down until they ’ve got there			0
the human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there			0
‘ the granite flakes when you grip it , creating tiny razor - sharp edges which cut the skin deep			2
@entity4 has taped up his fingers to protect them , but underneath , the skin is dry like toast			1
’ while many people have climbed the @entity18 — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins , no one has ever free - climbed it in a single attempt			2
although the pair are clipped to ropes , they must not use them to help in the ascent			0
instead , the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet			2
the men , who started the expedition on december 27 , begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm , just two hours before sunset			2
december and january were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip			2
climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer			0
but @entity45 has been unusually warm this winter , so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night , using head torches			0
@entity88 pulls on a relatively big hold during the climb precarious : the climbers have been living in a vertical world for weeks logistics : aside from the actual climbing , the climbers have a great deal of work to do managing their ropes on the long climb filmed all the way : a cameraman hangs from the rock face awaiting the arrival of @entity34 and @entity88 daring : free climbing involves using ropes to protect the men should they fall while climbing but it does not actually aid their ascent			1
above , @entity34 makes his way up one of the thin cracks that work their way up the route on @entity6 using a headlamp on sunday night up they go : @entity4 , 30 ( left ) , and @entity34 , 36 ( right ) , reached the halfway point on their attempt to free climb @entity7 's @entity6 earlier this week			1
they 've now been forced to separate at the dead of night , temperatures can plummet to well below freezing , as ice - cold winds sweep across the face of the rock			0
at midnight , after nine hours of climbing , they clamber into their ‘ portaledges ’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face			0
each has a stove to cook dried pasta , chilli and vegetables , brought by a six - strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp			0
on occasion , the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘ to take off the edge ’ , @entity34 says			2
before bed , they treat their cuts , grazes and bruises			0
writing from his tent via social media , @entity34 says : ‘ it ’s the most chapping environment in the world up here			1
[ it feels like ] we ’re grabbing razor blades			0
i wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands			0
’ bizarrely , they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew , charting their ascent , camps alongside them			0
‘ we have three double “ portaledges ” set up			0
it ’s like a five - star hotel up here ! ’ @entity34 says			2
in truth , few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep			0
they wake at 10am and have breakfast			0
by then the sun is out and they use solar - powered devices to charge their smart phones , and report back via social media to base camp , as well as family , friends and supporters			0
@entity81 believes @entity4 and @entity34 — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week			1
the greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather , or an acute injury to the hands			0
but even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature ’s greatest challenges .			0

@entity4 has had to fight through the pain of split fingers as he battles to join climbing colleague @entity34
the two are bidding to become the first free climbers to ascend the *notorious* @entity60 of 3,000 feet @entity6
the *imposing* granite *monolith* in @entity39 is considered to be the most difficult *multipitch* climb in the world
