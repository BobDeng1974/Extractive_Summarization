the 34 - year - old , who could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs from january 1 , is considering his options and will base his decision on whether he believes he can contribute regularly next season			1
@entity11 has no doubt @entity1 will be a huge influence on the team and insisted money will have nothing to do with whatever decision the midfielder reaches			1
a smiling @entity11 arrives at @entity19 on monday ahead of @entity0 's trip to @entity21 ( left ) while @entity1 was in relaxed mood while watching the @entity24 action at home on sunday ( right ) @entity26 captain @entity1 is driven to the club 's @entity27 for training on monday morning @entity1 's advisors have met both @entity11 and chief executive @entity31 in the past month and @entity0 's manager insists he has earned the right to take his time			1
@entity11 said : ' @entity1 has been offered a contract			1
he deserves the utmost respect and deserves time to consider that			2
it is a big moment to consider what he is going to do at this stage in his life			2
there are many things he has to think about but it certainly wo n't be money			2
' many believe @entity1 should be given a role at @entity48 for life and @entity11 certainly sees him as someone who has the potential to become a coach in the future but , for the moment , he simply regards him as a vital member of his squad			1
' he is still very much a player , ' said @entity11 , who is expected to recall his captain at @entity21 this evening			1
' this is his concentration			2
when i see how he trains and works it is still about playing			2
then maybe there is a role further down the line			2
to have someone like that beside you in a coaching capacity would be great			2
@entity1 was brought on as a late substitute in @entity0 's victory against @entity70 on saturday @entity1 ( left ) helped the @entity26 grab a vital victory , which was secured by @entity73 's late goal @entity1 posted this picture on his @entity76 page to dismiss reports of a rift between him and his boss ‘ at this moment it is purely about football			1
he ’s 35 at the end of this season and still has a couple of years to play if he wants			2
there are many things at this stage he needs to factor in			2
’ when asked if he and @entity1 had a problem , @entity11 said : ' 150 per cent no. there is no problem			1
we have a fantastic relationship			2
' he added : ' listen , i love working with him			0
he is arguably the best player in the history of the @entity24			1
i saw some things yesterday that were unfortunate in terms of a rift between us			0
but one thing we have together is honesty and respect			0
' it is not about the amount of games he will play now			0
it is the level of games he plays			0
no matter how good a player he has been , in the final few years you have to taper that			0
' everyone knows @entity1 's history here , what a player he has been			1
i need to focus that talent and utilise it in the games that he plays			0
he is a world - class talent			1
@entity11 and @entity1 have both moved to insist that there is no rift between the pair @entity73 was hurt in scoring the winning goal against @entity70 on saturday - and by the lack of a new deal @entity0 's players celebrate with the injured @entity73 after he secured their first win in three league games ' @entity1 , in terms of what he has done here , he deserves to concentrate on the team			1
it is just managing the period of his life that he is in			0
it is not a problem			0
it is not an issue			0
' all i can ever be is honest			0
that is how it will always be			0
he will be a key player here			0
i hope he will sign a contract			0
' @entity150 manager @entity149 raised the prospect that he would be interested in signing @entity1 if he became a free agent and it is inevitable clubs in @entity155 , the @entity156 and @entity157 , will be watching developments			1

when asked if he feared an approach from a @entity165 club , @entity11 said : ‘ i can only think about the situation here and i hope there is a solution with the club and his representatives			1
it is not about the money			0
it is about the time of his career in terms of playing			0
he is a big , big talent			0
’ @entity181 denies @entity11 rift after three straight @entity24 defeats the result against @entity70 was a much - needed boost for @entity11			1
but the 41 - year - old boss said his team 's achievement had been overshadowed by talk of a bust - up between him and @entity1			1
asked whether the victory could be a turning - point in their season @entity11 said : ' @entity70 had come to @entity48 looking to get a result			1
we did n't get back home until 4.30am on thursday ( after the @entity165 draw at @entity198 )			0
i have a huge amount of respect for the way that we kept the clean sheet			0
' we have not had a great start to the season			0
