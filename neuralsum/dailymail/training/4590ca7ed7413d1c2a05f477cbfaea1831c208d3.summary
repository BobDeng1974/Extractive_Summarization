professor @entity0 , pictured , claimed that opposition to genetically modified crops was a form of madness campaigners claimed a victory in their fight against genetically modified food last night after the @entity9 scrapped the job of a controversial @entity12 scientist			1
professor @entity0 , who served as chief scientific adviser to the @entity9 from 2012 , had argued that opposition to @entity15 crops is ‘ a form of madness ’			1
groups worried about so - called ‘ frankenfoods ’ wanted her position abolished , saying one adviser should not have so much influence on @entity9 policy			1
the @entity24 confirmed last night that her position was being abolished along with the @entity25 under which it fell			0
the commission denied it had anything to do with her views on @entity15 , but campaigners who had urged @entity9 president @entity32 to scrap the role welcomed the decision			1
a number of groups wrote to the commission this summer saying professor @entity38 , a former chief scientist for @entity39 , had presented ‘ one - sided , partial opinions in the debate on the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture , repeatedly claiming that there was a scientific consensus about their safety ’			1
last night @entity49 , of @entity50 , one of the groups that wrote to the commission , said : ‘ a single scientific viewpoint is a dangerous fallacy , so i very much hope that we can now look forward to a more widely informed dialogue			2
’ dr @entity57 , of @entity58 , said : ‘ a single scientific adviser can not possibly represent all the evidence and opinions relevant to the science policy debate			1
‘ there is a danger that chief scientific advisers become mere lobbyists for science funding , often in partnership with industry , and downplay scientific uncertainties and risks			1
’ @entity72 , chief scientist at @entity73 , said : ‘ scientific advice is the cornerstone of sound policy making			1
campaigners hailed the scrapping of @entity38 's important position at the heart of the @entity24 ‘ but the role of chief scientific adviser to the commission ended up hindering this process instead of helping it			1
’ while critics fear genetic modification of crops may pose ecological and health risks , farmers , scientists and multinational companies insist it is essential to boost agricultural productivity			0

the @entity98 said abolishing professor @entity38 ’s role ‘ appears to be a backward step for science ’			2
the @entity24 said mr @entity32 believed in independent scientific advice but had not yet decided how to ‘ institutionalise ’ it			2
professor @entity38 , who was chief scientist for @entity39 before she moved to the @entity9 , said last year : ‘ i am 99.99 per cent certain from the scientific evidence that there are no health issues with food produced from @entity15 crops			1
‘ @entity110 to @entity15 , and the benefits it can bring , is a form of madness i do n’t understand			2
’ scientific bodies accused anti-gm groups of ‘ shooting the messenger ’ , and had pleaded with the @entity9 not to pander to green campaigners ’ demands			2
the @entity119 last night said the move was ‘ deeply troubling ’			0
it said in a statement : ‘ this appears to be a backward step for science			0
at a time when we need to address serious concerns around food security , energy security and the collective @entity9 response to the threat of climate change , it is deeply concerning that the voice of science should be stifled			0
’ @entity136 , ceo of the @entity137 , added : ‘ this is troubling at a time when scientific endeavour should have a more important role than ever in tackling many @entity143 policy issues , not least in response to the food security challenge			0
’ and sir @entity146 , president of @entity147 , said : ‘ scientific advice must be central to @entity9 policy making , otherwise you run the risk of having important decisions being unduly influenced by those with mixed motives			0

’ @entity162 , @entity163 mep for @entity164 , said : ‘ i fear mr @entity32 has caved in to the green lobby			0
’ professor @entity38 had been based within the @entity25 , which has now been scrapped			0
it will be replaced by the @entity167 , which will give scientific advice to the commission but will not include a single scientific adviser			2
