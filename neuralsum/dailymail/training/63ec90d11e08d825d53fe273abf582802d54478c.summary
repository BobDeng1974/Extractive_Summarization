fatal accident : @entity1 crashed on the same halfpipe where snowboarder @entity3 sustained a traumatic brain injury in 2009 @entity5 freestyle skier @entity1 , a gold medal favourite for the @entity7 , died yesterday , nine days after crashing during a training run			1
@entity9 , one of the top half - pipe athletes in the world , died at the @entity13 hospital where she was taken last week following the accident in @entity16 , @entity17			1
she had sustained ‘ irreversible damage to her brain due to lack of oxygen and blood after cardiac arrest ’ , according to a statement released by her publicist			1
@entity9 , who lived near @entity26 in @entity27 , was a pioneer and ambassador for freestyle skiing who helped get her sport accepted for the @entity33			1
a four - time @entity35 champion , she crashed on the same half - pipe where snowboarder @entity3 sustained a traumatic brain injury during a training accident on december 31 , 2009			1
as a result of her fall , @entity9 tore her vertebral artery , which led to severe bleeding on the brain , causing her to go into cardiac arrest on the scene , according to publicist @entity46			1
miss @entity46 said @entity9 's organs and tissues were donated , as she had wanted			1
the statement said : ' the family expresses their heartfelt gratitude for the international outpouring of support they have received from all the people @entity57 touched			1
' @entity9 was the best - known athlete in her sport and will be remembered for the legacy she left for women in freestyle skiing			1
she set the standard for skiing in the superpipe - the extended half - pipe used in extreme sports - a sister sport to the snowboarding event that has turned @entity72 , @entity73 and others into stars			1
her arguments won over @entity96 officials and the sport will be included at the @entity7 in 2014 for the first time			1
@entity9 , who was married to freestyle skier @entity99 , would have been a favourite for a gold medal			1
@entity102 , the ceo of @entity5 's freestyle team , said @entity9 had fallen on the @entity104 after performing a trick known as a @entity106 540			1
he said the injury was due to a ' freak accident ' after a trick that was well within her capabilities			1
he said : ' our hearts go out to @entity57 's husband @entity99 and her entire family			1
it 's difficult for us to imagine their pain and what they 're going through			1
' earlier , before her death mr @entity102 said : ' @entity57 , in many ways , defines the sport			2
' she 's been involved since the very , very early days as one of the first people to bring skis into the pipe			1
' she 's also been very dedicated in trying to define her sport but not define herself by winning			2
for her , it 's been about making herself the best she can be rather than comparing herself to other people			2
' she was , mr @entity102 said , as committed to the grass roots of the sport - giving clinics to youngsters and working with up - and - coming competitors - as performing at the top levels			2
@entity137 , the @entity5 team 's high performance director , said : ' she was a great , positive person for the whole team , the whole sport			2
she enlightens the room , and she 's great			2
' true champion : @entity9 won many prizes but will be remembered as much for the legacy she left for women in superpipe skiing winning spirit : @entity9 celebrates on the podium after winning the women 's halfpipe freestyle title at the @entity153 finals in @entity154 , @entity155 @entity9 's death is sure to re-ignite the debate over safety on the half - pipe			2
@entity3 's injury - he has since recovered - was a reminder of the dangers			2
the sport 's leaders say mandatory helmets , air bags on the sides of pipes during practice and better pipe - building technology has made the sport safer , even though the walls of the pipes have risen significantly over the past decade			2
they now stand at 22 feet high			2
some of the movement to the half - pipe decades ago came because racing down the mountain , the way they do in snowboardcross and skicross , was considered even more dangerous - the conditions more unpredictable and the athletes less concerned with each other 's safety			1
but there are few consistent , hard - and - fast guidelines when it comes to limiting the difficulty of the tricks in the half - pipe , and as the money and fame available in the sport grew , so did the tricks			0
in 2010 , snowboarding pioneer @entity195 told @entity197 that much of this was self - policed by athletes who knew where to draw the line			0
' if the sport got to the point where half - pipe riding became really dangerous , i think riders would do something about it , ' @entity195 said			0
' it would n't be cool anymore			0
' tragic : @entity1 who helped get superpipe accepted into the @entity33 , died nine days after crashing at a training run in @entity16 , @entity17 true grit : @entity9 was considered one of the leading half - pipe athletes in the world , and was among the early favorites to win the @entity217 in her sport at the @entity219 in @entity220 , @entity221 his opinion is shared by many			1
' there are inherent risks in everything , ' mr @entity102 said			0
' certainly , freestyle skiing has one of the greatest safety records of almost any sport			0
freestyle is a very safe sport in large part because we had to build a safe sport in order to get into the @entity33			0
' the @entity5 skier grew up in @entity238 , but later lived near @entity26 in @entity27 she was a four - times @entity35 gold medalist in freestyle skiing @entity9 had long campaigned for equal opportunity for women in freestyle skiing			1
the sport that she fought for was finally to be included in the 2014 @entity33 she married fellow freeskier @entity99 in 2010 in 2009 , @entity9 broke a vertebra in her back after landing awkwardly while competing in slopestyle at the @entity35			0
it was her lobbying that helped get the @entity35 to include women 's slopestyle - where riders shoot down the mountain and over ' features ' including bumps and rails			0
it was n't her best event , but she felt compelled to compete because she pushed for it			0
she came to terms with her injury quickly			0
' i 've been doing this for a long time , 11 years , ' she said in a 2010 interview			0
' i 've been very lucky with the injuries i 've had			0
it 's part of the game			0
looking back on it , i 'd probably do the exact same thing again			0
' she returned a year after that injury and kept going at the highest level , trying the toughest tricks and winning the biggest prizes			0
a native of @entity278 , @entity238 , she won the @entity279 in 2007 as female action sports athlete of the year			0
in 2010 , she married @entity99 , and they were stars in a documentary film project on the @entity284 called ' @entity285 '			0
in her interview with @entity197 two years ago , @entity9 reflected on the niche she 'd carved out in the action - sports world			1
' i think we 're all doing this , first off , because we love it and want to be the best , ' she said			0
' but i also think it would 've been a great opportunity , huge for myself and for skiing and for everyone , if we could 've gotten into the ( @entity297 ) @entity33			0
i mean , i 'm super lucky to be where i am , but that would 've been pretty awesome			0
' a little more than a year later , with @entity9 's prodding , her sport was voted into the @entity33 for 2014 .			0
