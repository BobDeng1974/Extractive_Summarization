by @entity0 one in three drivers is so clueless when it comes to road signs that they can not even recognise the symbol for the national speed limit , a survey claims			1
a quarter of us are also unaware that blue motorway signs also explain the speed limit , while one in seven motorists mistakenly thought that ' slippery road ' warning sign meant that the road had been freshly painted			1
eight per cent of drivers admitted they were baffled by the common ' road narrowing ' sign , while almost a fifth said they did not know that when driving in a built - up area the speed limit is 30mph unless signs say otherwise			1
the scale of ignorance was revealed in a survey of 2,000 drivers by car insurers more than			1
the results also found that a ' worrying ' proportion of drivers regularly ignore speed limits and drive as fast as they want to			1
more than a third ( 36 per cent ) said they disregard 30mph limits , travelling at an avergae of 38mph , while 32 per cent said they break 47mph limits , going 47mph on average instead			0
on motorways , even more people admitted to ignoring the law , with 43 per cent breaking the 70mph in favour of an average speed of 81mph			0
more @entity46 spokesman @entity45 said : ' this research shows there ’s a worrying number of drivers for whom speeding is an acceptable everyday behaviour			2

' the large - scale confusion over road signs comes weeks after transport secretary @entity62 called for hundreds of thousands of ' pointless ' signs to be torn down			2
whatever could it be ? a large proportion of drivers could n't recognise this sign ‘ over the past two decades we ’ve seen a huge rise in the number of unnecessary signs blotting the landscapes of our towns and cities ’ , he said			1
‘ many of the signs that go up are simply not needed and it has got to stop			0
as well as spoiling otherwise beautiful areas of the country , pointless signs just confuse drivers and make the roads less safe			0
' a spokesman for road safety charity brake said : ' the research suggests a significant proportion of drivers seem to think it is okay to break the laws of the road			2
' it can never be acceptable and we urge all drivers to respect road safety laws and recognise that such laws exist to help save lives			0
