by @entity0 published : 15:29 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 06:23 est , 14 november 2012 a stonemason has ' rip - ossessed ' a headstone worth nearly £ 10,000 after the bill remained unpaid for more than three years			1
self - employed stonemason @entity4 , 54 , went to the extreme lengths of tearing down the memorial when he was left out of pocket after chasing the family for payment for the ‘ star memorial ’ in @entity12 , @entity13			2
last month he partially dismantled the elaborate headstone for @entity15 and @entity16 to try and ‘ cause a reaction ’ to motivate the family to pay up			2
grave decision : stonemason @entity4 has removed the headstone after a £ 10,000 bill went unpaid by the family for three years mr @entity4 ( left ) and his brother @entity23 ( right ) lift the masonry onto a forklift			1
the memorial put his business into the red due notice : the stonemason attached a warning to the grave three months ago , to no avail @entity33 : the cost of the ornate memorial put mr @entity4 , an independent businessman , out of pocket but his desperate act was ignored , forcing him to completely remove the elaborate 4ft high memorial			1
crafting it put him into the red and he was forced to pay debt collectors from his own savings			0
last month mr @entity4 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' i have been forced to pay out of my own savings to try and keep my business afloat			1
' this was one of the biggest and most ornate graves i have ever made			0
' £ 10,000 is a lot of money to be left out of pocket with when you 're a small business			2
' it would have been the star memorial in my brochure and it is easily the biggest in the cemetery			0
' i had no reason to think they would n't pay me but the situation has turned into a nightmare			0
' the family had bought another gravestone from me previously and i had confidence in them			0
’ before and after : a colleague of mr @entity4 says the removal pricked the stonemason 's conscience but he felt he had no choice a notice was placed on the grave three months ago warning that it could be taken away			1
mr @entity4 hoped the notice would shock the family into action but the bill remains unpaid			1
last month a man claiming to be the daughter 's partner at her address said the family had offered to pay and they could prove it , but nothing happened			0
colleague @entity86 , speaking last month as the headstone was being partially dismantled , said : ' i think @entity4 does feel guilty about this but he has given them every opportunity that he possibly could to pay			2
' @entity4 is a really nice guy and he has given them so much time to actually deal with this			0
