diarist @entity0 likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the @entity4 , according to new research			1
it was previously believed that the @entity8 teenager , who was sent to the @entity9 , died of typhus on 31 march 1945 , two weeks before the camp was liberated			1
however a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid february , meaning that even if @entity19 troops had reached the camp a little sooner , she would likely not have survived			1
the book documents how @entity0 , her sister @entity32 and her family went into hiding in a canal house , but were eventually betrayed and sent to @entity9 , where she and her sister perished			1
@entity0 wrote her diary while in hiding from @entity38 persecution during @entity28 by 1940 the @entity26 had occupied the @entity27 , leaving the family trapped			2
in 1942 the family went into hiding in secret rooms of @entity43 's office building			0
but after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the @entity9 , where @entity0 died of typhus in 1945			1
@entity43 , @entity0 's father , returned to @entity47 after the war and discovered her diary had been saved			2
it was published in 1947 , leading to her posthumous fame			0
after the war the @entity27 government set the official date of her death as march 31 , based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in march			2
because the @entity58 liberated the camp on april 15 , this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved			1
however , @entity63 , a researcher at the @entity65 museum , has now revised that date having studied witness accounts , archives , and conducted at least one new interview			0
ms @entity63 said she now believes that @entity0 and her sister began exhibiting symptoms of typhus at the beginning of february			2
according to @entity27 health authorities , most patients do not live for more than 12 days after that			0
' in view of this , the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in february			0
the exact date is unknown , ' the study says			0
ms @entity63 added : ' it was horrible			0
but when you say they died at the end of march , it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation			0
@entity9 was liberated in april 1945 , meaning if @entity0 died in march , then she was two weeks from rescue			1
but this new study shows she was months from safety ( @entity0 pictured left , with father @entity43 , and right ) @entity0 and her sister @entity32 died during a typhus epidemic that swept through the @entity9 camp in 1945 , killing an estimated 35,000 people ( pictured , typhus patients inside the camp ) ' so maybe if they 'd lived two more weeks ... well , that 's not true anymore			1
' it is unlikely that the exact date of @entity0 's death will ever be uncovered , as disease was so common in the camps that individuals passing away often went unnoticed			0
in the words of one witness , @entity112 , who knew the @entity43 sisters and was cited by researchers , ' one day they simply were n't there anymore			0
' @entity0 and @entity32 were just two of an estimated 35,000 deaths at @entity9 when a typhus epidemic swept through the camp in early 1945 .			1

@entity0 died from typhus in the @entity9
previously thought she died on in march , weeks before camp was liberated
but new research has shown she likely died some time in mid february
even if @entity19 troops had arrived earlier , she could n't have been saved
