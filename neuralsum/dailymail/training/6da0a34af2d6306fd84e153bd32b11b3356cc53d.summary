by @entity0 published : 05:45 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 17 april 2013 the @entity1 made a rare appearance at the funeral of a so - called commoner today as she attended the service held in honour of @entity7 at @entity8			1
@entity7 was the @entity1 's eighth and longest serving prime minister and the @entity10 's friends and allies were said to be delighted the monarch decided to attend			1
traditionally the @entity1 does not attend funerals of so - called commoners			1
the only other time she has broken with tradition was in 1965 when she attended the funeral of @entity18			1
@entity1 , wearing black wool coat and hat with a triple string of pearls at her neck , sat with prince @entity25 at her side as she listened to the heartfelt tributes paid to @entity29 's first female prime minister			1
palace officials then confirmed the monarch would join mourners at @entity8			0
as reported by the @entity57 's royal correspondent @entity56 , the @entity1 and @entity7 , born six months apart , were two women very much making their mark in a man 's world			2
but , @entity56 says , the @entity1 is often said to have had a less than easy relationship with @entity7 , her eighth – and longest - serving – prime minister			2
' always mindful of her constitutional role and cordial to the last , the monarch is nevertheless said to have personally disagreed with some of mrs @entity7 's more divisive policies and privately expressed her alarm over issues such as unemployment and the miners ' strike			1
' smart : the @entity1 wore a black wool coat and matching hat with triple string of pearls for the occasion close relationship : the @entity1 and @entity7 met for weekly meetings while @entity7 was in power upon hearing the news of @entity7 's death two weeks ago , a @entity81 spokesman issued a statement saying the monarch was ' sad to hear the news of the death of @entity7 ' and would be sending a private message of sympathy to her family			1
inside the service today the @entity91 paid tribute to this ' remarkable ' woman who inspired many			0
she had , he said , a great capacity to ' reach out to the young and to those who were not in the world 's eyes important			0
' he recalled her strength , power and dedication - and how she was affected by the loss of her beloved husband @entity106			0
he spoke of @entity7 's increasing debilitation , from which , he said , she is now liberated			2
the congregation sang @entity110 before the @entity91 spoke his final words of address			0
despite fears of dissent , the atmosphere outside the cathedral was by and large very positive			0
those close to @entity8 's had arrived very early in the morning - some staying overnight - to secure a spot nearby			0
the crowds lining the streets , referred to as ' real @entity121 ' , gave out huge cheers as key @entity123 arrived - @entity124 and @entity125 - but reserved their biggest cheers for the @entity127 and @entity128			0
respect : the @entity1 's decision to attend was said to have delighted @entity7 's friends and allies born six months apart , they were two women very much making their mark in a man 's world			1
but the @entity1 is often said to have had a less than easy relationship with @entity7 , her eighth – and longest - serving – prime minister			2
always mindful of her constitutional role and cordial to the last , the monarch is nevertheless said to have personally disagreed with some of mrs @entity7 's more divisive policies and privately expressed her alarm over issues such as unemployment and the miners ' strike			1
while the @entity1 may have found her first female prime minister somewhat frosty , mrs @entity7 's respect and admiration for the monarch knew no bounds , not least because she had been raised in an intensely patriotic family			1
strained relationship ? the @entity1 and prince @entity25 arrive at @entity7 's 80th birthday party at the @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , in october 2005 she once told author @entity157 that the talk of a strained relationship with the @entity1 was ‘ a lot of nonsense ' and spoke with admiration about her commitment to the @entity166 and armed services			1
‘ no one could curtsey lower than @entity7 , ' said another former aide			2
inevitably , after 11 years of almost weekly meetings , the pair reached something akin to friendship			0
mrs @entity7 was even said to have jokingly sent the monarch a pair of rubber gloves as a @entity176 present after witnessing her doing the washing up following a barbecue at @entity179 without a pair			2
other sources say it was n't that the two women did not like each other , they were simply very different people			0
the queen is dry and rather witty in private , while @entity7 always had a tendency to hector , regardless of her audience			2
@entity7 curtsies to the @entity1 on her arrival at @entity190 's in @entity156 for a glittering dinner to celebrate the former prime minister 's 70th birthday the queen with @entity7 in @entity195 , @entity196 , for the @entity166 conference in 1979 @entity7 curtsies to the @entity1 in 2007 following a memorial service comemmorating 25 years since the @entity200 conflict at the @entity201 in @entity202 , @entity203 in 1986 , their relationship was put under the spotlight when @entity207 reported sources close to the @entity1 saying she was ‘ dismayed ' by ‘ uncaring ' mrs @entity7 's refusal to impose sanctions on apartheid @entity213 , a decision the monarch feared would split the @entity166			1
the monarch is required constitutionally to keep her opinions private			0
the quotes were subsequently attributed to the @entity81 's press secretary , @entity220			0
the queen is said to have rung her prime minister to reassure her that her views were nothing of the sort			0
if the relationship was never entirely easy , the two certainly never wavered in their mutual respect			0
@entity1 , in particular , is said to have admired mrs @entity7 's grit , determination and enormous achievements			1
after her enforced resignation in 1990 , the @entity1 awarded @entity7 the @entity233 and the @entity234 – neither of which has been offered to @entity237			1
she was also a guest of honour at @entity7 's 80th birthday celebrations			2
fellow guests were touched at the sight of the @entity1 taking the hand of the most influential woman in modern @entity29 politics as she gently raised her from a deep curtsey , before guiding the already frail baroness through the throng of assembled guests			0

@entity1 and prince @entity25 broke with tradition by agreeing to attend funeral
decision delighted @entity7 's friends and allies
