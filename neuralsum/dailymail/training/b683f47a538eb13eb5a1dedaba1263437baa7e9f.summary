when @entity1 made the stunning selections of youngsters @entity3 and @entity5 in his very first @entity7 team in the @entity8 , jaws hit the @entity10 floor			1
we knew @entity12 was no ordinary manager , but this was team selection from the @entity14			0
yet no - one could have predicted that the @entity15 would go on to become the top - flight 's biggest tinkerman			2
even @entity20 's @entity19 sides look predictable compared with the chopping and changing at @entity7 this season			1
you 've about as much chance of predicting the lottery numbers as you have trying to second guess who @entity12 will pick to start against @entity27 on sunday in the reverse of the opening fixture of the season			1
but , after a quick call to @entity32 , a comparison between @entity12 's first selection and the most likely @entity7 team to start at the @entity36 makes for stunning reading			2
@entity1 's first @entity8 game in charge at @entity7 sprang a few surprises @entity12 watched on as his @entity7 team , which included two stunning selections , lost to @entity27 @entity43 scored @entity7 's first goal of the season and is one of the only survivors from the team @entity5 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) were the two biggest shocks in @entity12 's first league team only four players from the team who were sunk 2 - 1 at @entity10 are likely to be handed the chance to wreak revenge on @entity27 after a season of enormous upheaval			1
@entity58 , @entity59 and @entity43 look certain to survive the cull after the opening - day defeat , although which position the @entity64 captain will feature in is anyone 's guess as he is shunted from centre forward to no 10 , central midfield , defensive midfield and then back up front again			1
@entity3 , 20 , and @entity5 , 22 , have both been deemed below the required standard to make @entity12 's team - at least for now - while @entity72 joined @entity73 on loan in september and @entity75 packed his bags for @entity77 in january			1
but there are others who have since fallen victim to @entity12 's tactical whims			0
@entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 have all enjoyed extended stints in the @entity7 team but are far from certain starters			2
after his goalscoring return in the @entity90 win against @entity91 , @entity84 looks the more likely to start			0
@entity92 established himself as a favourite of @entity12 's on the left flank in the former @entity97 boss 's much - maligned 3 - 5 - 2 formation but is only making his way back from a torn hamstring suffered on @entity100			2
@entity101 ( second left ) struck the decisive blow as @entity27 stunned @entity10 @entity7 's team since that day is much - changed , with the likes of @entity75 ( left ) having left the club how @entity7 lined up against @entity27 on the opening day of the season , in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation of those who started on the bench back in august , only the unconvincing @entity109 and the reborn @entity110 are in contention for the reverse fixture at @entity27			1
@entity116 has gone on loan to @entity118 , @entity115 made his loan to @entity120 permanent last month , while @entity121 is still yet to play for the @entity122			0
@entity123 was sent back to his adoring fans at @entity125 and @entity126 went on a temporary move to @entity128			0
meanwhile , @entity12 has splurged over £ 150million on a wealth of talent , who have carried @entity7 to third in the table and kept the club on course for a @entity136 spot without ever offering convincing evidence that they are growing into a top - class team			2
@entity140 ( £ 16m ) and @entity141 ( £ 30m , but signed before @entity12 's arrival ) are likely to start at the @entity143			0
@entity141 was missing from @entity7 's season opener along with fellow injury victims @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , who is another @entity12 favourite at right wing - back or right back if needed			1
@entity151 arrived for £ 60m from @entity73 last summer in a @entity153 record transfer buy @entity154 has struggled to find his feet at @entity7 and looks set for the drop again @entity146 ( right ) missed the season opener and has not hit top form this term pitch map showing how @entity7 could * line up at @entity27 on saturday ( * note ' could ' ) but it is further forward where @entity7 's spending spree has made the most impact on the team			1
@entity151 , the @entity153 record £ 60m buy from @entity73 , and @entity168 , who cost £ 15m from @entity169 , are almost certain to start in central midfield			0
@entity171 , the former @entity172 keeper who joined as a free agent in january , is likely to be joined on the bench by young defender @entity175 and possibly another young player , 19 - year - old striker @entity176			0
he will be competing for a spot with @entity154 , whose £ 6m loan from @entity179 on £ 250,000 - per - week wages is proving to be a costly and embarrassing mistake			0
the @entity183 striker has been @entity12 's first - choice in recent weeks but his miserable form surely means demotion to the bench or even further into the abyss			2
after all the ins and outs , @entity12 's matchday squad of 18 is likely to include just nine of those who saw in the new season full of hope that their new @entity15 manager would lead them to a title triumph after a year in the doldrums after sir @entity201 's retirement			0
it is not just the personnel that has changed at @entity10 since then , but the attitude			0
( 3 - 5 - 2 ) @entity206 @entity58 @entity207 @entity82 @entity207 @entity59 @entity207 @entity3 @entity208 @entity92 cm @entity83 cm @entity84 cm @entity75 @entity209 @entity5 @entity210 @entity43 @entity210 @entity72 @entity211 @entity116 @entity115 @entity121 @entity109 @entity126 @entity123 @entity110 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity206 @entity58 rb @entity149 @entity207 @entity59 @entity207 @entity140 lb @entity141 @entity212 @entity168 cm @entity151 cm @entity84 am @entity110 @entity210 @entity43 @entity210 @entity146 @entity211 @entity171 @entity148 @entity92 @entity109 @entity175 @entity83 @entity154			1

@entity7 face @entity27 in the @entity8 on saturday
fixture is reverse of opening game of the season , which @entity27 won 2 - 1
defeat was @entity1 's first league game as @entity7 boss
his team that day included @entity5 and @entity3
saturday 's team will be *hugely* different to the one selected at @entity10
only four players are likely to have survived from that team
