' it 's a tournament i grew up watching as a kid so it 's definitely special to me			2
apart from the majors , a @entity13 or two possibly , i do n't see a tournament i would more like to win			2
' my form is good , i 've been playing well and building some nice momentum			0
i 've had three top 10s in a row , three top fives in my last two and i feel like there 's more to squeeze out of my game , too			0
' i feel that the next couple weeks i can progress even more and if that translates into wins , that would be fantastic			0
it would be great to win heading into @entity55 , but at the same time i feel like my game is in good shape to put up a good title defence there			0
