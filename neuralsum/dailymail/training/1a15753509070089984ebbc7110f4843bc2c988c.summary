in one he says : ‘ @entity44 , i fear you are bound to haunt my mind for the rest of my life			2
i feel i can rest in you and depend on you			2
’ in another , he writes : ‘ i long to be in your arms and comforted and able to talk to you for hours alone ... it is very selfish of me to demand so much of you in sympathy and warmth but as you have both i must rest in them			2
’ a young @entity1 and one of the letters he wrote to @entity58 in 1964 in a note sent in october 1970 , he asks when his lover is free to have lunch with him , adding : ‘ i long and ache to see you			1
@entity64 ’ even before his marriage , @entity1 had a reputation as a ladies ’ man and had been engaged three times			2
but it was not until the death of mrs @entity16 , aged 98 , that it emerged the mother of two was not only a friend but his lover			1
the affair was revealed by her son @entity76 , who said it was her wish that , once she was gone , the world should learn the truth			2
affair : the letters show sir @entity1 had a four - year affair with mrs @entity16 in the 1970s while he was married to @entity14 , pictured they met in 1929 at a sports day at @entity87 prep school in @entity88 , @entity89 , where @entity1 was a 22 - year - old @entity90 master			1
she was 20 and had gone to see her two younger brothers compete			2
she wrote of this first encounter : ‘ quite suddenly in a flash i was aware that this was no ordinary person , but someone very special			2
no , it was n’t love , it was just an awareness of potential greatness			0

mrs @entity16 once said : ‘ he was a highly sexed man , practically to his death ’ , but added : ‘ to be with @entity149 was to enter another world – a more scintillating world , with the freshness of a child ’s outlook , where everything is a discovery , nothing taken for granted , things seen not with the sight but with his vision and enhanced by his imagination			1
’ the letters , the last of which was sent two years before @entity1 ’s death in 1984 , will be on show from october 27 at @entity169 ’s @entity168 in @entity170 , @entity171 , where the poet once lived			1

mess up the mess they call a town - a house for ninety - seven @entity202 once a week a half a @entity200 twenty years			0
and get that man with double @entity204 'll always cheat and always win , who washes his repulsive @entity208 women 's tears : and smash his desk of polished @entity210 smash his hands so used to @entity212 stop his boring dirty @entity213 make him yell			0
but spare the bald young clerks who add the profits of the stinking cad ; it 's not their fault that they are mad , they 've tasted @entity222			0
( this is a shortened version of ' @entity181 ' )			0
