all schools should put pupils in sets based on ability , @entity0 said last night in an apparent hint at future @entity7 education policy			1
his comments go much further than education secretary @entity9 , who last year denied reports that the party wants compulsory setting in all secondary schools			1
mr @entity0 has long been an enthusiast for setting , but his ambition has been thwarted by parts of the educational establishment and by the @entity18			1
learning : all schools should put pupils in sets based on their ability , @entity0 said ( posed by models ) some @entity24 are also concerned at the idea of imposing compulsory rules on academy schools , which are run on the principle that they are free from state control			0
in an interview with @entity33 , the prime minister said : ‘ all schools , in my view , should set by ability , particularly in @entity37 and maths			1
’ his comments will cheer traditionalists and millions of parents but not teaching unions , which believe that setting can be elitist			1
last autumn the @entity24 announced plans to allow setting to be imposed to help turn around failing schools			2
although mr @entity0 ’s comments suggest he wants to go considerably further , a senior @entity7 source insisted he was not announcing new policy			2
however , he confirmed the prime minister ’s concern at standards in thousands of ‘ coasting ’ schools			0
views : @entity0 supports school setting , but his plans have previously been thwarted the source said : ‘ as his comments suggest , the prime minister is a very strong supporter of setting – it ’s about placing children with others of similar ability so that they can learn at the right pace			1
‘ where a school is failing we think it is right that part of the toolkit for putting things right should include bringing in setting			2
‘ the vast majority of schools already set in core subjects , and if there is a successful school doing very well without setting then we would not impose it – we want to take a pragmatic approach			2
' our focus is on schools that are failing parents and pupils , and the prime minister has also spoken about the need to improve standards at schools that are coasting			0
’ mrs @entity85 , who replaced @entity86 as education secretary last year , stamped on reports last september that the @entity24 back the idea of compulsory setting			1
reports claimed that the @entity24 would attempt to introduce setting in all secondary schools , with the policy enforced by @entity95			2
mrs @entity85 said there was ‘ absolutely no truth in these rumours ’			0
setting is backed by @entity95 ’s chief inspector sir @entity100 , who said in 2012 that bright teenagers fail to achieve top grades in some comprehensives because teachers insist on mixed - ability classes and concentrate on weaker students			1
sir @entity86 said gifted children were being held back in some schools that do not allow setting to stretch their best pupils			0
he said mixed - ability classes , which became fashionable following the introduction of comprehensive schools , could be a ‘ curse ’ to able children			0
but the @entity115 , has described the idea of compulsory setting as ‘ educationally unjustifiable ’ , saying it is the ‘ last thing ’ ministers should do if they want to close the attainment gap between rich children and poor			0
the union said : ‘ the evidence is overwhelming that this practice holds back poor children , denying them access to an appropriately demanding curriculum			0
’ under the existing @entity7 plans , announced last autumn , regional schools commissioners would be given new powers to impose setting in failing schools as part of a package to turn them around .			0

@entity137 *'s* comments go further than view of his own education secretary
plan will cheer traditionalists - but unions *complain* setting is elitist
previous policies have also been thwarted by the @entity18
