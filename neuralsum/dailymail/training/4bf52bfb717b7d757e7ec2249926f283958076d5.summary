while @entity2 and @entity3 held a minute ’s silence at every game after the terror attacks on @entity7 last week , @entity1 football wrapped itself up in its cosy blanket of arrogance , ignorance , insularity and insensitivity and carried on doing the appalling things with which it is now sadly synonymous			1
a footballer convicted of rape , still serving his sentence and on the sex offenders ’ register expected sympathy when he moaned about ‘ mob rule ’ stopping him having a career ( he could flip burgers under the golden arches if he is so keen to work rather than live off the money he takes from the family of the girlfriend he showed no respect to when he raped another woman )			1
a @entity31 manager turned into one of the country ’s finest legal minds when he declared he ’s done what he claims few others have , and studied the @entity38 case in detail and he ’s decided the rape conviction is n’t safe			1
the @entity42 team held a minute 's silence in memory of the victims of the terror attacks in @entity7 ahead of sunday 's @entity3 match with @entity47 at the @entity48 @entity50 players form a huddle to remember the 17 victims of the @entity7 attacks before their match in @entity55 fans of @entity57 display a ' @entity59 ' banner in solidarity with the victims of the shooting at satirical newspaper @entity63 in @entity7 , ahead of their @entity2 match with @entity65 on saturday he concluded @entity38 has a good chance with his ‘ appeal			1
’ except it ’s not an appeal because the court decided not to give him leave to appeal			0
it ’s a case review			0
but then @entity74 actually does n’t have a clue what he ’s talking about			2
he ’s just got a special ' football friend ' who he wants to support ( @entity78 and the @entity80 chairman @entity79 are pals apparently ) and so @entity78 has taken his size 11 feet , put some massive heavy hobnailed boots on them and trampled all over the sensitivities and feelings of the rape victim , the rape victim ’s friends and family , all women across the world and all decent , right - thinking men by talking utter garbage			2
meantime , the chief executive of the @entity95 , @entity96 , who has been in his job for 35 years , decided he ’d make a comparison between @entity38 and the @entity100 victims			1
it ’s not just the fact that @entity96 thinks he can pre-empt the outcome of the @entity104 ( @entity105 – remind me never to use these two if ever i ’m in need of legal representation ) , no it ’s worse than that			2
@entity38 , seen here with girlfriend @entity111 , was unable to secure a move to @entity80 @entity115 manager @entity74 , claiming he 'd studied the @entity38 case in detail , came to the conclusion that the convicted rapist had a good chance with his ' appeal ' ( which is actually a case review ) @entity95 chairman @entity96 compared the @entity38 case with the 1989 @entity100 how the @entity121 reported @entity96 's comments to lump the @entity125 fans at @entity100 that fateful day in with @entity38 , someone who it has been established beyond doubt cheated on his girlfriend by having oral sex with a girl who was completely drunk ( part of @entity38 ’ failed defence was that the victim was so drunk she had forgotten she ’d consented and ergo consent was given , rather than not been in any fit state to consent - he really did try to argue that in court ) who he had never met before he entered the hotel room , then had sex with her ( watched by one friend who was also in the room and filmed by others who were outside ) and left via the fire escape			1
appalling from @entity96 , and what a class act @entity143 , chair of the @entity145 , is to accept @entity96 ’s apology			2
this is one very special woman			0
worse to follow : the @entity148 decided it did n’t need to intervene in the @entity38 situation			2
that ’s right , the governors of our beautiful game had absolutely nothing to say about a convicted rapist , out under licence , still claiming his innocence and because of that showing no remorse for his crime , and not apologising for his crime , potentially playing for a professional football club under its governance			1
the @entity148 , who champion equality , who are promoting women ’s football massively , who do so many good things for so many good causes in this country , had nothing to say about the @entity38 situation			1
how is that possible ? @entity80 chief executive @entity174 reads the statement confirming the club wo n't be signing @entity38 @entity80 fans make a protest about the 70,000 plus people who signed a petition against them signing @entity38 @entity80 boss @entity182 ( right ) was left to get on with preparing his team as the @entity38 affair rumbled on the worrying outcome is that clubs are left rudderless , unable to guide themselves , and so you ’ll get a manager claiming he ’s a legal expert , you ’ll have a chairman thinking it ’s fine to employ someone on the sex offenders ’ register at a football club which positions itself at the very heart of a diverse community and actively encourages families , women and children to go to see what is on offer at @entity201 , and you ’ll end up with a @entity95 chairman who really should know better , talking so thoughtlessly that he insults thousands of still grieving people on @entity204			1
football in @entity1 is still a sickening mess of racism , anti-semitism , misogyny , and ignorance			1
' do n’t sign too many black players because they ’ll form a clique and get you the sack , ' a former manager told me			0
' when can the lads take a sh * t on your face ? ' a professional footballer who has played in the @entity31 once said to a female reporter as she prepared to interview him			0
the club effectively swept it under the carpet , her male bosses did the same			0
' what ’s @entity227 done wrong ? ' so many people screamed after his quenelle gesture			0
those who were so ignorant they had to ask such a crass question must now be looking at the jewish community fleeing @entity7 like the @entity235 did in @entity236 in the 1930s and feel ashamed of themselves			2
@entity227 's anti-semitic ' quenelle ' gesture caused controversy back in february last year i ’m generalising here of course , and it ’s worth saying that so many people within the game are wonderful people who give up their time and money for the good of football , charitable causes and the community			1
but the bigger picture is that football in @entity1 is a whole bowl of wrong			2
and events last week showed just how backward the game is in this country when it comes to a question of what is right and decent			0
a thoroughly sickening time for @entity1 football ended with nobody at the @entity148 , the @entity31 , the @entity267 or any individual clubs giving a second thought to the horrors in @entity7			1
@entity271 spoke eloquently on the subject in his press conference while the @entity275 and @entity276 players all wore black armbands			0
@entity278 , who ’s from @entity279 , held up a @entity280 after @entity281 scored and @entity282 tweeted a photo of their @entity285 player @entity284 holding a poster which read ' @entity287 ' in support of those who suffered in @entity7			0
there may have been other individual marks of respect , but no directive was sent down from the football authorities and no game held a minute ’s silence			1
@entity281 's @entity285 player @entity278 holds up a @entity280 after scoring against @entity297 @entity282 's @entity285 midfielder @entity298 holds a ' @entity287 ' sign in support of the victims with more than 40 @entity285 players here , that is a disgraceful fact that does not reflect well on @entity1 football			1
common decency seems to be impossible for some people who hold responsible positions in football in this country			0
that needs to change and some proper leadership is required to make that change happen throughout our game			0
is it wrong for me as a lover of football to want the game to be decent ? no , actually i want more than that – i want the national game to be one of the beacons of what is good about @entity1			1
to show the way , to set an example , to be pure and wholesome			0
not to spit - roast girls and treat them like pieces of meat			0
not to show ignorance or indifference to political and religious hate			2
not to be totally insensitive towards people who have suffered the most appalling tragedies and horrors			0
so while @entity337 , @entity285 and others across @entity339 showed respect , @entity1 did n’t			0
in a country that will hold a minute ’s silence for people who have n’t even died , no decision - makers thought the tragedies in @entity285 warranted any kind of collective respect from @entity1 football			1
to paraphrase @entity349 in @entity350 , a film about a man who unexpectedly has to suffer the consequences of his appalling actions : ' be decent football , be decent			0

there was a minute 's silence at @entity2 and @entity3 games after @entity7
but @entity1 football *continued* to show its ignorance and insensitivity
@entity38 *complained* that ' mob rule ' was stopping him finding a club
thousands signed a petition against convicted rapist signing for @entity80
@entity115 manager @entity74 claimed @entity38 had a good chance with ' appeal '
@entity95 chief @entity96 compared the @entity38 case to @entity100
@entity1 game a ' mess of racism , anti-semitism , misogyny and ignorance '
