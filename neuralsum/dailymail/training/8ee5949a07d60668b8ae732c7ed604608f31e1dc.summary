by @entity0 the @entity2 ’ @entity3 topped the charts , @entity1 had just won the @entity5 and @entity6 was happily puffing his pipe in @entity8			1
as @entity10 walked in the sunshine , pushing her six - month - old daughter , she was suddenly struck by a crippling fear of open spaces			1
the effect of that summer ’s day in 1966 was so terrifying that it would be the last time the 31 - year - old housewife ventured outdoors for nearly half a century			1
proud : @entity10 with grandson @entity18 , left , and pictured right at the height of her agoraphobia with her daughter @entity21 , who 's now 30 in all that time , mother - of - two mrs @entity10 never went more than a few yards from her front door , never walked her children to school or took her grandchildren out and could not even go shopping			1
imprisoned by agoraphobia and in dread of what might happen if it struck her again , she kept in touch with her family by telephone – or , in recent years , the internet			1
meanwhile , outside her @entity40 home , the world was transformed by the rise in the number of cars , the ease of foreign travel and the decline of the high street			1
that passed mrs @entity10 by , until her 26 - year - old grandson @entity49 was awarded the @entity50			1
mrs @entity10 was so proud that she summoned the courage to be outdoors for the first time since that august day 48 years ago			1
fear factor : mrs @entity10 said that seeing her grandson receive the award was ' terrifying , but worth ' connected : mrs @entity10 says that she keeps in touch with family and friends using @entity59 agoraphobia is ' a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult , or help would n't be available if things went wrong ' , according to the @entity67 website			1
the site explains that it 's often thought that the condition is a fear of open spaces , but it 's not quite as straightforward as that , with some sufferers also fearing public transport and shopping centres			2
when agoraphobics are exposed to their fears several symptoms can sweep over them , including a feeling of nausea , rapid heartbeat and breathing , nausea and rising temperature			2
the cause of agoraphobia can vary from person to person , with some people developing a fear of a certain situation or place because they experienced a panic attack there and then try to avoid it			2
others may develop the condition through a fear of crime or being involved in an accident			2
treatments may involve counselling , relaxation training or taking antidepressants			2
@entity105 says : ' in the @entity107 , up to two people in 100 have a panic disorder and it is thought around a third of those will go on to develop agoraphobia as a result			2
' source : @entity105 in an almost clandestine operation to get to the presentation ceremony last week , she was ushered into a car that drew up at her door , driven for a few minutes to the venue and introduced to the lord lieutenant of @entity121 and the town mayor after they presented the medal to mr @entity49 for his services to a local community centre			2
then she sat in a garden for a time with him – and went back indoors again			1
yesterday she told the @entity130 : ‘ it was really scary but i ’m glad i did it			1
@entity18 did n’t have any idea i ’d be there and he was thrilled			2
i ’m glad i stayed to watch the ceremony but the only thing i really wanted to do was get back home			1
’ mrs @entity10 , now a 78 - year - old great - grandmother , told how her self - imposed confinement began as she walked to her local post office			1
she was swept by an unexplained feeling of panic			2
voices around her suddenly became distant and everything went hazy			0
‘ i was rooted to the spot , ’ she said			0
‘ i actually thought i was going to die			0
the only thing i knew i needed to do was get home as soon as i could			0
i shut the door ... and i did n’t answer it again for the next three years			0
i ca n’t explain it , but i just could n’t face going out again			0
’ mrs @entity10 , already divorced from husband @entity149 , was told electric shock treatment would cure her but she refused			1
instead she became a recluse			0
@entity152 did her shopping and her mother helped her to raise daughter @entity155 , now 48 , and son @entity156 , 50			0
she has lived every day in terror of injuring herself and needing treatment			0
‘ if i had to be rushed to hospital the experience would probably kill me , ’ she said			1
‘ i just would n’t go			0
it ’s a terrible feeling			0
you just ca n’t control it			0
’ here are some of the things @entity10 has missed since developing agoraphobia although she has been smuggled to her children ’s homes for the occasional @entity169 or @entity170 , she had not spent time outside for five decades until last week , when she was collected from the care home where she has spent the last seven years			1
of the short drive to the ceremony , she said : ‘ there are cars and motorbikes everywhere and everyone seems to drive like @entity179			0
’ yet indoors she has easily embraced new technology – she uses an @entity181 , has a @entity59 page and shops online			0
her biggest regret is that agoraphobia robbed her of the chance to spend more time with her family			0
what would she do now if she could lead a normal life outside ? ‘ go to the tulip gardens in @entity190 ... visit @entity191 ... go to where my grandmother was born in @entity193 ... spend lots more time seeing my family ... it ’s the simple things you miss out on , ’ she said			0
there is one thing she has n’t missed since 1966 , however : @entity1 winning the @entity5 again .			0

@entity10 , from @entity40 , became agoraphobic back in 1967
she left the house , though , to see her grandson get a @entity50
' it was a very scary experience for me , but worth it , ' she said
