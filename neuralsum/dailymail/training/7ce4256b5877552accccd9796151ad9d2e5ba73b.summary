the most reverend @entity0 said he wrestles with disbelief – most recently when out on his morning jog			1
he also acknowledged that @entity11 have trouble explaining why @entity4 allows suffering in the world			1
the extraordinarily honest admission – during which the @entity5 said he was straying into territory where an @entity17 leader should not go – came as he spoke during a visit to @entity19 earlier this week			0
asked if he ever struggled with doubt , the @entity5 said : ‘ yes i do			0
i mean there are moments where you think “ is there a @entity4 ? ” , “ where is @entity4 ? ” ’ he added that there were moments when he was struck with doubt even while praying , including during his morning jogs near his official @entity29 residence @entity30			1
‘ i love the @entity32 , if you look at @entity34 , that ’s full of doubt , ’ he told the congregation			0
‘ i go , well i call it running , the dog calls it holding her back , in the morning			2
‘ the other day i was praying over something as i was running and i ended up saying to @entity4 “ look this is all very well but is n’t it about time you did something , if you ’re there ” – which is probably not what the archbishop of @entity6 should say			1
’ but he added : ‘ it is not about feelings , it is about the fact that @entity4 is faithful and the extraordinary thing about being a @entity11 is that @entity4 is faithful when we are not			1
’ asked how to persuade people who think religion is outdated , he said @entity11 did not have the answer to why @entity4 allows suffering			1
‘ we turn the tide in a number of ways , ’ he said			0
‘ we know about @entity60 , we ca n’t explain all the questions in the world , we ca n’t explain about suffering , we ca n’t explain loads of things but we know about @entity60			2
we can talk about @entity60 – i always do that because most of the other questions i ca n’t answer			2
’ archbishop @entity0 admitted that @entity11 were unable to answer why @entity4 continues to allow suffering this is not the 58 - year - old ’s first brush with controversy since his appointment in november 2012			1
he criticised payday lender @entity72 without realising the @entity17 ’s financial arm , the @entity75 , had indirect investments in the firm believed to amount to around £ 75,000			0
archbishop @entity0 opened his attack on @entity72 in an interview in which he declared : ‘ i ’ve met the head of @entity72 and we had a good conversation and i said to him bluntly , “ we ’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence , we ’re trying to compete you out of existence ”			1
’ he suggested that 16,000 churches could form the basis of a network of non-profit lending organisations			0
however , it later emerged that it would take up to a decade before any sort of church network might emerge			0
and in june , the @entity75 said they would continue to invest in @entity72			0
the chairman of @entity17 ’s @entity95 , @entity96 , said that the row had ‘ highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment , and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio ’			0
