‘ perfectionism wrecks self - esteem unless it ’s checked			1
it can be a brilliant trait to get you places , but unfortunately it involves a lot of self - criticism and unless you can moderate that , you become more susceptible to doing drastic things , ’ she said			1
dr @entity61 said she had seen a ‘ massive uptake ’ in the number of patients citing social media as playing a role in their illness			2
‘ it ’s exploded in the past five years			2
what social media is doing is making us more dissatisfied with our bodies , as well as pushing a message that they are modifiable , ’ she said			2
social media was encouraging eating disorders in people who might not previously have developed problems , she warned			1
‘ it ’s like sitting someone who ’s a bit run - down next to someone with a cold			1
they ’re going to catch that cold			2
if you were more robust , with better immunity , you could withstand it			2
but social media is so powerful that it ’s catching those who only have slight tendencies			0

’ at @entity29 , headmistress @entity109 told @entity40 of the subtle pressure to be perfect promoted by , among others , parents			1
‘ i ’ve had parents in my study who ’ve said “ i want my daughter to go to @entity116 to study architecture ” , ’ she said			0
‘ and i ’ve turned to them and said “ lovely , but what does your daughter want ? ” managing expectations : ‘ real life is not about perfection			0
even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks , disappointments and failures , ’ said @entity12 headmistress @entity21 she also told of the difficulties in blocking websites which promote anorexia , known as ‘ pro-ana ’ sites			1

her pupils at @entity29 are only allowed ‘ brick ’ mobile phones without internet access until they are 13			1
the school has also introduced talks for parents on @entity145 and @entity146			1
