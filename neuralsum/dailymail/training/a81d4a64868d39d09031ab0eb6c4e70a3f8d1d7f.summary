@entity0 runs you through what we 've learned this weekend , from @entity5 qualifying action to the lower leagues			0
this week , there as a win for @entity9 over @entity10 at @entity11 , a precious point for @entity13 in @entity14 and plenty going on in @entity15 and two			1
@entity17 ’s man of the match award against @entity10 at @entity11 suggests he ’s finally living up to his early promise as an @entity9 player			1
the @entity21 midfielder has now started six games in a row for @entity9 – his longest run in the side since @entity26 first picked him as a raw 19 - year - old in 2011			1
the @entity10 victory was @entity17 ’s 25th cap – but only the third time he has completed all 90 minutes of an international			1
@entity17 was named man of the match in @entity9 's 3 - 1 win over @entity10 at @entity11 2			1
one of @entity36 ’s cutest moves was to convince @entity37 centre back @entity38 , born in @entity39 , that he could play international football for @entity13 thanks to his mother being born in @entity43			1
the 25 - year - old was outstanding alongside @entity46 ’s @entity45 as the @entity47 held @entity49 favourites @entity14 to a goalless draw in @entity51			1
@entity52 gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes and made nine clearances – including one that turned @entity58 ’s dangerous cross away from the goal line			0
in the four qualifying games in which @entity52 has started , @entity13 have conceded just two goals			2
@entity38 ( right ) helped @entity13 to a valuable goalless draw against @entity14 in @entity51 @entity52 celebrates with @entity63 ( right ) after @entity13 earned a point which kept them top of their group 3			1
former @entity9 manager @entity26 signed a contract in january to be @entity70 ’s boss until 2018 – but it ’s beginning to look very unlikely he will still be in charge next year , let alone when they host the @entity73			1
@entity26 has n’t been paid since his side flopped out of the group stage in @entity76 back in june , with @entity79 @entity78 officials whispering they ca n’t afford his £ 8.6million a year salary			2
a 1 - 0 defeat away to @entity84 leaders @entity81 in @entity82 on saturday night wo n’t have done much to encourage them to find ways of coming up with the cash			2
@entity26 saw his @entity70 side beaten 1 - 0 by @entity81 in @entity82 on saturday @entity89 celebrates after scoring the only goal for @entity81 in their win over @entity70 4			1
@entity93 was once a fertile hunting ground for @entity96 scouts searching for bargain players , but no longer , it seems			0
@entity99 ’s @entity98 was the only member of @entity101 ’s 22 - man squad that drew 1 - 1 in @entity102 who is currently playing in the @entity104			2
and @entity98 , a starter in his country ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity70 last month , found himself only on the bench this time before getting on for the last half hour			2
@entity93 were held to a 1 - 1 draw in @entity102 in their @entity5 qualifier 5			2
@entity111 naturally earned plaudits for dashing home from @entity114 to keep a clean sheet in @entity117 ’s win at @entity118 – but an even better effort was made by @entity121 ’s @entity120			0
the 23 - year - old midfielder , an unused substitute for @entity123 , needed two flights and a fast car to get back in time to play for @entity127 ’s side at @entity128			0
he flew from @entity129 to @entity130 , then caught another plane to @entity132 , before dashing down the @entity133 only to find himself on the bench again			0
@entity120 , a former @entity136 youth player , got on for the last 28 minutes but to no avail as @entity139 ’s goal gave the home side a 1 - 0 win			1
@entity111 played in @entity123 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity114 in @entity129 @entity111 was back in action for @entity117 17 hours later and kept a clean sheet at @entity118 6			1
the @entity146 ’s commitment to sport remains questionable when they ca n’t be bothered to run @entity149 show on international weekends			0
no championship games took some of the glamour out of the weekend but there were still enough big games in @entity15 and two that were worth covering			0
in all more than 136,000 people paid to see the 22 games over the weekend			0
as a comparison , a week ago the @entity159 attracted 205,000 fans			0
@entity163 ’s first attempt to make it in @entity96 football flopped when he could n’t make it at @entity167 – it maybe did n’t help that he was handed the number 32 shirt previously worn by @entity170			0
second time round in the @entity104 , and at the age of 26 , he ’s showing signs of being ready for the challenge with four goals in 10 starts so far for @entity136			0
the renewed confidence , helped by getting nearly a goal every two games playing for @entity180 in the @entity181 , is also showing in his international appearances for @entity183			0
it was @entity163 ’s goal that clinched a 1 - 0 win over @entity187 to put his country into the finals of the @entity190			1
@entity163 scored the goal that saw @entity183 beat @entity187 to qualify for the @entity190 8			0
@entity193 ’s production line of players never seems to stop			2
watch out for their @entity9 youth international @entity196 to be the next to make an impact in the @entity104			2
the 20 - year - old , on loan at @entity199 , is normally a central defender but was called into service as an emergency midfielder against @entity203 and was outstanding in the 1 - 0 win that ended the 22 - game unbeaten run of the @entity208 leaders			1
@entity196 , on loan at @entity199 from @entity193 , in action against @entity203 at the @entity211 9			1
@entity212 is rebuilding his career at @entity214 after a nightmare spell in @entity216 when his £ 200,000 move to @entity218 turned sour			0
the 23 - year - old striker was told in the summer he could leave @entity220 despite having two years left on the contract he signed when he moved north from @entity199 in 2013			2
his goal in saturday ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity227 was his eighth of this season , already two more than the former @entity224 trainee scored in a miserable year that ended with @entity218 getting relegated			1
@entity212 scores @entity214 's second goal in their 2 - 0 win over @entity227 10			1
@entity234 appeared to have taken a mission impossible when he returned to management in charge of a @entity239 team who were rock bottom of the @entity149 and without a win all season			0
two months later he ’s lifted them six points clear of the relegation places after the 1 - 0 victory against @entity247 which was his fifth win in eight games			1
@entity250 has been the signing of free agent @entity252			0
the striker had n’t played in @entity9 since 2007 when he walked out of @entity214 to force a move to @entity255 – and since then has been in @entity216 , @entity256 and @entity257 before coming home without a club to go to			2
the 33 - year - old former @entity261 international got his fourth goal in five games against @entity247			0
@entity252 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity239 against @entity247			0

@entity17 was named man of the match in @entity9 's win over @entity10
@entity38 starred in @entity13 ' 0 - 0 draw against @entity14 in @entity51
@entity26 is under even more pressure with @entity70 after another loss
@entity196 , on loan at @entity199 , could be @entity193 's next *prospect*
