throw out the record books			0
@entity15 has made the history @entity17 was hoping for by claiming the @entity10 men 's singles title			1
not since 1936 has the @entity19 witnessed a home winner but the 26 - year - old @entity21 fulfilled a lifetime ambition , and those of generations of tennis fans , by defeating @entity26 in the men ’s singles final 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4			1
the @entity29 crowd erupted with a roar never before heard as the @entity31 plunged a groundstroke into the net to give @entity1 the victory			2
but he had thoroughly earned it			0
he threw off his hat , screamed in joy , and pumped his fists in the direction of his team up in the stands and he scaled the steps to hug each of them in turn			0
there were tears from him and his mother @entity48			1
it may have been straight sets but there was drama at the finale			1
history boy : @entity15 is the first @entity56 to lift the @entity10 men 's trophy since 1936 crowd scene : @entity1 celebrates on his way to celebrate with the fans after winning the @entity10 title family affair : @entity1 embraces mother @entity48 as she cries tears of joy after her son 's victory ca n't believe it : @entity1 collapses in celebration on @entity29 after winning his championship point tough battle : a exhausted @entity1 embraces opponent @entity26 after the heroic straight sets win will @entity15 win @entity73 ? @entity1 needed four championship points to get the job done but that will not matter a jot			1
serving for the match , he raced a 40 - 0 lead and stood on the precipice of history ground - breaking enough to shake @entity29 to its core			0
but @entity26 , never one to give up easily , ensured the wait would go on a little longer , saving all three championship points , then doing the unthinkable and holding three break points			2
but @entity1 only increased his athleticism , his determination , his guts , to turn it around and show he was the better player			2
adulation : @entity1 lifts the famous trophy in front of the adoring @entity29 crowd after his win not letting go : @entity1 cradles the trophy the @entity17 public have craved since @entity13 's win in 1936 making history : @entity1 celebrates winning the first set on the way to his historic victory flying : but @entity101 was defeated by the brilliant @entity21 in straight sets trophy collection : @entity26 , with the runners ' - up shield , congtratulates @entity1 after his win it was excruciating			1
but what are a few extra minutes when you ’ve been waiting 77 years ? the opening told how the match would take shape with plenty of break points and long rallies from the outset			0
there was ebb and flow too			0
@entity1 won the first three points only for @entity26 to take the next five			1
at 1 - 1 , the third game provided a vignette of the quality , excitement , and gripping tension that would follow			0
it took beyond 10 minutes and had epic rallies lasting 24 and 25 shots			0
at the end of it @entity1 was celebrating , finally breaking his advisory for the first time at the seventh time of asking			2
acing the competition : @entity1 delighted the @entity29 crowd by being in top form in the final cheering him on : @entity1 's girlfriend @entity137 was right behind him as he made @entity17 sporting history @entity139 : @entity1 became the first @entity140 to win the men 's @entity141 for 77 years splitting it up : @entity31 world no 1 @entity26 takes a slide on the @entity29 grass @entity26 broke straight back in the next game , but , at 3 - 3 on the @entity149 ’s serve @entity1 ’s defensive qualities shone through			1
he took it , then secured a vital , tense service game to lead 5 - 3			2
minutes later he had the all - important first set			2
the second saw more gruelling groundstroke duels before @entity26 , as expected , upped his game to break in the fourth game			2
but with @entity1 at the peak of his abilities – full of running and incredible reaches – it never felt like that would prove definitive and indeed it proved as he broke back in the seventh			0
@entity26 showed an unusual lack of composure in handing the game to @entity1 with a double fault			1
errant challenges were also becoming a feature , and at 5 - 5 on his serve , @entity26 would come to rue the incorrect calls to @entity171			1
at 15 - 15 he felt a ball from @entity11 fell long but he had lost the ability to challenge			0
after losing the point he was evidently upset , asking umpire @entity175 : ‘ you ca n’t see this ? ’ @entity178 : @entity179 celebrates another point on the way to winning the coveted title on target : @entity1 was in sensational form as he claimed the @entity10 title against the world no 1 djokovic it turned out he was wrong anyway and the ball clipped the line but @entity26 was rattled			1
the score progressed to 30 - 40 and a shot into the net gave @entity1 an important break			2
he served it out , laying down an ace to take the second set and a 2 - 0 lead			0
not since @entity201 in 1927 had a player come back from two sets down to win a men ’s final			2
that bit of history was too much to change			0
@entity1 was on a roll , breaking @entity26 in the first game of the third set and then taking another to make it five games in a row			1
but , once more , @entity26 surged , breaking @entity1 twice to claim four in a row in response			1
yet again the momentum swung , however , and this time decisively in @entity1 ’s favour			0
with lung - busting sprint after lung - busting sprint , he first got level to 4 - 4 , then took the score in the penultimate game to 40 - 15 in his favour with a trademark forehand down the line on the run			1
the game was sealed and the rest is ( new ) history			0
vocal support : tennis fans swamped @entity230 to cheer their hero on at the @entity19 no enough : @entity233 1 @entity26 aims a shot but can not stop @entity1 triumphing in straight sets range of emotions : @entity1 shows his frustration after losing a point ( left ) and celebrates after the match 1987 : born may 15 , @entity241 , @entity242			1
