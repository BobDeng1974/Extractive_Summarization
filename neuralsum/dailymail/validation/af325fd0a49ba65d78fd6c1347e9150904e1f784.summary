with just six weeks to go until the birth of her second child , you ’d expect all eyes to be on the royal bump			1
but it was the duchess of @entity9 ’s gleaming hair that was the star when she went to @entity11 this week			1
the secret behind her glossy chestnut locks is said to be an organic vegetable - based salon treatment to boost colour and shine			1
but can you get the look at home ? from rinsing with fizzy water to a home - made strawberry and mayonnaise mask , we tried the @entity25 tricks to boost dry locks			1
can we recreate the glossy effect at home using @entity25 remedies ? @entity35 to your rinse with sparkling water @entity39 why ? apparently used by @entity41 actress @entity40 , this is highly recommended by @entity43 , at @entity44 in @entity46 ’s @entity45			1
‘ @entity48 water is excellent at creating shine as the low ph level — or high acidity — combats frizz by smoothing the hair ’s cuticle			1
@entity55 is one of the most acidic , so i suggest trying that , ’ he says			0
test : i wash my hair as usual before braving the @entity55 rinse , which is actually refreshing			1
i drench my hair thoroughly , but only use a third of the bottle			1
though i have few expectations , the finish is almost that of a professional blow dry			0
@entity67 : ‘ this sounds like an urban myth , but the cold , acidic water will flatten the cuticle of the hair , smoothing down the surface and allowing light to bounce off , ’ says consultant trichologist @entity68			1
@entity76 : 6/10 golden oil to @entity78 frazzled locks @entity81 multi-purpose dry oil for body and hair @entity81 multi-purpose dry oil for body and hair , £ 14 , escentual.com why ? containing borage , sweet almond , hazelnut , @entity89 , camellia and macadamia plus vitamin e , this dry oil leaves skin feeling soft , supple and hydrated , but , according to the blurb on the bottle , works just as well on hair			1
test : it looks as though a child has mixed olive oil with glitter and shaken it up			1
i use sparingly on washed and dried hair , nervous i ’ll look greasy rather than groomed			2
the slightly cloying sweet - smelling oil smooths on well and the golden particles catch the light and make my hair look expensively shiny			1
@entity67 : ‘ a dry oil forms very small molecules , which are better absorbed by the hair than a wetter product , ’ says @entity68			2
@entity76 : 7/10 mask made in your kitchen @entity116 's @entity115 and fresh strawberries strawberry and mayonnaise mask why ? home - made hair treatments using strawberries are the talk of many beauty websites			1
the soft fruit is acidic and good at regulating oil production in the scalp , say converts			0
the best and simplest recipes involve mashing a few fruit with a moisturising ingredient like mayonnaise			0
test : the smell of mayonnaise and strawberries makes me feel faintly nauseous			0
i ’ll be honest , keeping mayo - coated lumps of strawberry on your head for ten minutes is n’t pleasant			0
thankfully , it ’s not too hard to wash off			0
there are chunks of strawberry in the shower , but the mayonnaise does n’t leave my locks greasy			2
my hair is a bit softer , but it ’s a lot of effort for little gain			2
@entity67 : ‘ the acidity of the strawberries will seal the cuticle , but you ’d be better off just using a professional product , ’ says @entity68			0
@entity76 : 5/10 @entity158 @entity160 hair care range @entity160 range , from £ 17.25 for the shampoo , o - right.co.uk why ? it ’s claimed the coffee oil in this haircare range — each bottle of shampoo contains oil extracted from 16 cups of recycled coffee grounds — treats dry ends			1
the caffeine is said to stimulate hair growth			2
there ’s also organic silicone for a glossy finish			0
the bottle , made of recycled coffee waste , can be planted as there ’s a coffee bean in the base			2
test : i ’m all for a latte , but using a shampoo and conditioner smelling of coffee beans is a first			2
afterwards , i apply the transparent oil			0
it ’s a leave - in treatment , applied before drying			0
i use the oil sparingly but after a rapid blow dry , my hair looks almost polished			2
it holds this sleek look all day , without greasiness ( though my hair is flatter than usual ) and friends say how groomed i look			2
@entity67 : ‘ this range could be great for dull , frizzy hair as coffee is mildly acidic , which means it will smooth the hair cuticle , ’ says @entity68			1
‘ but the effects will be temporary			0
’ @entity76 : 9/10 @entity202 blow dry @entity205 - bristle brush @entity207 & @entity208 boar - bristle brush , £ 20 , rockandruddle.co.uk why ? ‘ boar bristles are strong and resilient , with microscopic scales running along them , ’ says @entity210 co-founder @entity209			0
‘ these drag the hair ’s natural sebum [ oil ] down the shaft so that it looks shiny and healthy			1
’ why ? i blow dry my hair with my usual ceramic brush until almost dry , then use the boar bristle brush to smooth it down			2
i never thought i ’d feel strongly about a hairbrush , but this is excellent			0
it cuts through tangles with ease and leaves my hair shiny			1
a blow dry in a brush			0
@entity67 : ‘ boar bristles are similar in structure to our own hair , and the cuticles will interlock with our own cuticles and push them down into place , ’ says @entity68			2
@entity76 : 9/10 home - made glitter goddess @entity241 embossing powder in tinsel gold @entity241 embossing powder in tinsel gold , £ 4 , hobbycraft.co.uk and hairspray why ? the rumour is that @entity249 star @entity248 ’s shiny hair is down to her hairdresser using a ultra-fine glitter powder mixed with hairspray			1
test : a stylist friend suggests mixing gold glitter ( the sort used for @entity258 cards ) with hairspray			0
i sprinkle some on my hair , follow with a blast of @entity265 spray then add another sprinkle of glitter			1
the resulting effect catches the light pretty well ( quite a lot falls off onto the kitchen floor too )			0
a good party look and it washes out pretty well			0
@entity67 : ‘ more fancy dress than enhancing hair health , ’ says @entity68			1
@entity76 : 5/10 @entity275 your do home - made glycerine spray , @entity278 , £ 2.59 , lakeland.co.uk why ? i am told about making your own glycerine and water spray by a friend who swears blind that it will make my hair photo - shop shiny			1
test : glycerine , added to hair products to add moisture , is also used in royal icing , and i have some in the cupboard			0
i shake up four parts water to one part glycerine then spray it on my hair			0
here ’s the surprising thing — it gives a groomed finish			0
a bit more and the final look is over-greasy for everyday glamour , but i can see it would work well for photos			0
@entity67 : ‘ be very wary — hair can go from shiny to greasy in the blink of an eye if this is over-used , ’ says @entity68			1

even the @entity307 ' baby bump ca *n't* *compete* with her super shiny hair
can dousing your locks in glycerin , glitter or coffee recreate @entity28 's gloss ?
