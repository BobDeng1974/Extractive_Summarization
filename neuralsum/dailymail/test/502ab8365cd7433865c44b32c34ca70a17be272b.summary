eight years after their son was brutally murdered by the man he loved , @entity0 and @entity1 are still wondering what they could have done differently to prevent his death			1
the couple raised @entity9 and his three brothers in the tiny isolated welsh village of @entity12 and now regret that they did n't teach him to be more ' streetwise			2
' ' @entity9 was n't street wise , he was too trusting and as a parent , that 's where you think maybe i 've failed him , ' @entity0 reveals on the latest episode of tv show @entity22 's @entity21			1
over the course of their relationship , @entity27 conned @entity9 out of thousands of pounds and when his lover finally got wind of his theft and deceit and threatened to go to the police , he murdered him			1
@entity9 was only 30 when he was killed in 2007			1
@entity27 had lured him to a @entity41 at @entity43 services on the @entity44 near @entity45 on september 15 , 2007 , where he fatally hit him over the head with a fire extinguisher			1
when @entity9 's body was discovered , @entity27 claimed he had not been with @entity50 that evening and said a rent boy was to blame			1
but police were able to gather enough evidence to prove @entity27 was involved - including internet searches on his computer on the best way to kill a man by striking him on the head			1
@entity9 , pictured , was killed at the age of 30 after he discovered his boyfriend was conning him and his family out of money @entity27 was found guilty of murder in 2009 and sentenced to life in prison , serving a minimum of 25 years			1
eight years later , @entity0 and @entity1 and still dealing with their grief and are still blaming themselves for failing to see @entity27 's true colours before it was too late			2
@entity0 said he seemed like a ' caring man ' when @entity9 first brought him home to meet them			2
' he just came over as a caring person and nothing was too much trouble			0
he was a charmer , ' she said			0
@entity9 and his parents were n't the first to have been taken in by @entity27			1
when he met @entity50 , he was actually on probation having been released from prison for committing fraud			0
in his twenties , he had scammed friends and family out of thousands of pounds by pretending to have cancer and organising fundraising events where the money for ' charity ' went straight into his pocket			2
he worked as an air steward for @entity90 and also conned strangers and colleagues by telling them he could make them money through an investment opportunity he had been given by the company			0
through his fictitious investment opportunity and cancer con he made thousands of pounds which he used to fund a lavish lifestyle , going on exotic holidays and driving expensive sports cars			0
such was his love of the high life and charming manner - which hid his true deceitful personality - he was dubbed ' the real talented mr @entity105 ' when he appeared in court after the character made famous by @entity108			0
@entity109 , a former colleague of @entity110 explains : ' @entity111 had forged a letter head from @entity90 , saying that @entity90 were offering employees and friends and family the opportunity to invest in @entity90 , whatever they invested they would get three times back within six months			2
' @entity111 went around the local community offering this investment , to whoever he could			0
they did n't have a lot of money themselves they were vulnerable			0
' he was going on holiday in @entity127 and running around in soft top cars , he lived the high life with other people 's money			2
' it was @entity109 who eventually suspected @entity27 's investment opportunity was not all it seemed after she became embroiled in his cancer con			2
she and other friends believed he was dying of the disease as he had been shaving his own head and cracking blood capsules in his ears to make it appear he was having seizures			0
when @entity109 realised @entity27 was n't a cancer victim and was conning his friends into donating money , she reported him to the police			1
this lead to his four year imprisonment for the cancer and @entity90 investment scams			0
a friend who fell victim to @entity27 at this time said : ' the effects of @entity111 ’s callous acts will impact on us for a long time to come			2
@entity27 was jailed for life for murdering @entity9 by striking him round the head with a fire extinguisher she continued : ' @entity111 systematically targeted friends and family who were more than willing to help and support a friend in need			1
for our loyalty and trust , we were rewarded with betrayal and a lot of heartache			0
' but these victims were luckier than @entity9 , who paid with his life after being conned by @entity27			1
while the conman was committing his crimes in @entity28 , back in @entity172 , @entity9 had started a relationship with a woman and had two daughters			2
however , he struggled with his sexuality and the couple separated when @entity9 realised he was gay			0
he started seeking a relationship with a man at the same time @entity27 was released from prison and they began their relationship with @entity183 of his lover 's criminal past			1
@entity27 began to con @entity9 out of money and convinced @entity0 and @entity1 to also give him money			1
@entity1 said he promised them a ' holiday of a lifetime ' and they gave him hundreds of pounds towards a deposit as they had no reason to suspect their son 's boyfriend was n't honest			1
' he told me he was with the airline business and he was quite wealthy , ' @entity1 said			0
the couple were told he said he could get a luxury holiday on the cheap through his connections and discounts but they 'd have to pay a deposit			0
during the course of his relationship with his son , they paid @entity110 thousands and @entity1 admits that after a while he began to think ' this fella has taken us for a ride			0
' it was a conclusion @entity9 also eventually came to and when he confronted his lover and threatened to go to the police , he was murdered			1
@entity0 said they were stunned when they were told their son 's body had been discovered with fatal head wounds			1
' you feel as though it ’s not happening , that it ’s in a book or a film or something and somebody is going to come along and say , you know it 's not real			0
and you think like that for a long time , that it ’s not real , ' she said			0
now @entity27 has been brought to justice and jailed , the parents are trying to move on and keep their son 's memory alive for their grandchildren			1
@entity1 said : ' it does n't get any easier , you just learn to cope differently with it			0
@entity9 would say life 's for living and that 's what he did - he lived life to the full , he enjoyed life , he loved people			2
' @entity22 's @entity21 is on the @entity250 at 9pm			0

@entity252 was murdered by @entity27 in 2007
fatally struck across head with fire extinguisher by his lover
he 'd discovered @entity27 had been conning him and his family out of money
@entity9 's parents wish they could have prevented their son 's death
