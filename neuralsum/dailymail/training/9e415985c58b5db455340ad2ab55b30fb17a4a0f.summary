@entity4 @entity7 , adm. @entity8 has given the go - ahead for the creation of a @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
he is calling on the technology industry , government labs and academia to help build what is being dubbed as the @entity2 suit in reference to the @entity19 character @entity18 , an engineer who builds a rocket - powered suit and becomes a superhero			1
vision : an @entity2 - style suit may soon be created to give @entity4 army troops a ' superhuman strength ' on the battlefield			1
pictured : a screenshot from the army video creation : @entity4 @entity7 , adm. @entity8 has given the go - ahead for the creation of a @entity11 ( @entity31 ) specifications : the suit would be designed to enable soldiers to carry large loads as well as having layers of smart materials fitted with sensors speaking about the recent death of a special operator in @entity42 he told a conference : ' i would like that last operator to be the last one we ever lose			1
' ' one of our folks going through the door was killed by the @entity51 on the other side in an attempt to rescue a hostage , ' said @entity8			0
' why have n't we put effort into ensuring particularly that guy going through the door ... is protected to the maximum capability that we can provide him , as a nation ? ' the metal suit would be designed to enable soldiers to carry large loads - relying on tiny motors , the exoskeleton would enable a soldier to run and jump without strain			1
the @entity67 said it would also have a wearable computer similar to @entity69 , reported the @entity70			2
the exoskeleton would be able to continuously download and display live video feeds from overhead drones			0
the suit has drawn comparisons @entity2 , a superhero who appears in comic books published by @entity19 it would have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors and which would transmit the wearer 's vital signs back to headquarters			1
the @entity84 reports that in theory it could even staunch minor wounds with inflatable tourniquets as well have a built - in oxygen supply in case of poison gas and a cooling system			2
other desired specifications are smart materials fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature , heart rate and hydration levels			1
many of the technologies that could be incorporated into @entity8 â€™s idea of an @entity2 suit already exist			0
' but they still exist separately			0
so they are taking them all and they are putting them together , ' said former @entity109 seal @entity107 to @entity110			0
@entity107 said if @entity11 is completed with the desired specifications it will ' take a group of guys that are extremely high functioning on the battlefield and make them completely unstoppable			2
' an mit team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied			0
' it sounds exactly like @entity2 , ' @entity116 professor @entity122 told @entity4 news site @entity124			2
' the other kind of things that you see in the movies ... would be the kind of external suit that @entity130 wears in @entity131 , where it 's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human			0
' @entity136 , who buys equipment for the @entity138 said : ' the hope is that we would have some working full - up prototypes in the two - to three - year time frame			1
' contracts have not yet been signed , and the @entity144 has not ventured to make a cost estimate			0
in may the @entity109 decided to order sailors new shipboard coveralls after discovering the flammability of the garment last year			0
