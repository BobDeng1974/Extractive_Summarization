@entity1 co-treasurer @entity0 has resigned after being filmed apparently offering access to prime minister @entity3 in return for donations of £ 250,000 a year			1
the senior @entity1 fundraiser told undercover reporters pretending to be business representatives that ' things will open up for you ' if they donated that amount of money to the @entity12			1
in a meeting secretly recorded by @entity15 , he said : ' it will be awesome for your business			0
' quit : @entity1 co-treasurer @entity0 has resigned after being filmed apparently offering access to the @entity3 in return for donations of £ 250,000 a year announcing his resignation , mr @entity0 said in a statement : ' i deeply regret any impression of impropriety arising from my bluster in that conversation			1
' clearly there is no question of donors being able to influence policy or gain undue access to politicians			2
' specifically , it was categorically not the case that i could offer , or that @entity3 would consider , any access as a result of a donation			1
similarly , i have never knowingly even met anyone from the number 10 policy unit			2
under fire : @entity43 challenged the prime minister to ' come clean ' about what he knew and when ' but in order to make that clear beyond doubt , i have regrettably decided to resign with immediate effect			0
' mr @entity0 said he only took up the post at the beginning of the month and was ' keen to meet anyone potentially interested in donating '			1
he said he had not consulted any politicians or senior party officials before the recorded conversation			0
mr @entity0 told the undercover reporters that ' premier league ' donors - those giving £ 250,000 a year - could lobby mr @entity3 directly and their views were ' fed in ' to @entity61			1
he said there was no point in ' scratching around ' with donations of £ 10,000			0
according to @entity15 , he believed that any prospective donations from the reporters - pretending to be wealth fund executives - would come from @entity68 and would be ineligible under election law			2
@entity0 , @entity70 ’s 15th richest man , has enjoyed a spectacular rags - to - riches story			1
the son of a meat porter in @entity75 ’s @entity74 , he left school at 15 and went on to become one of the richest men in the @entity79			0
after starting out as an office junior he became a @entity79 trader before setting up the spread betting firm @entity83 , which focuses on bets on the financial markets			0
in 2007 the investment bank @entity86 bought a 10 per cent stake in @entity83 , which valued mr @entity0 ’s business at £ 1.4 billion			1
he has given about £ 350,000 to the @entity1 in the last two years and also helped bankroll the recent ‘ @entity90 ’ campaign			0
friends describe mr @entity0 as a classic ‘ @entity93 geezer ’ who enjoys his wealth			1
he showed off a £ 200,000 platinum watch in one recent interview and boasted that he had 15 more			0
he told one interviewer : ‘ i ’ve got a £ 10 million apartment in @entity100 , a £ 5 million house in @entity101 , another fantastic house in @entity103 , a yacht and a private jet			2
’ in one shopping spree he bought 17 pairs of shoes at the same store so he could have identical pairs in each of his five homes			0
he is also known to have been a member of the prestigious @entity113 , which plays host to some of @entity117 's top players			0
they are said to have discussed the creation of a @entity70 subsidiary and the possibility of using @entity70 employees to make the donation			1
the journalists secured the two - hour meeting with mr @entity0 through @entity126 , a former @entity1 staffer now working as a lobbyist			1
the @entity15 said she told the reporters they should make a ' huge donation ' if they wanted access to senior government figures			1
' mr @entity3 today responded to the damaging revelations by branding mr @entity0 's ' cash for access ' claims as ' completely unacceptable '			1
the prime minister insisted that was ' not the way ' the @entity1 raised money and promised an inquiry to ensure it would not happen again			1
he said it was right that treasurer @entity0 had resigned overnight in the wake of the revelations about his comments to undercover reporters posing as potential donors			1
' what happened is completely unacceptable			1
this is not the way that we raise money in the @entity1 , it should n’t have happened , ' mr @entity3 told @entity153			1
' it ’s quite right that @entity0 has resigned			1
i will make sure there is a proper party inquiry to make sure this ca n’t happen again			1
' the claims are particularly damaging , however , given mr @entity3 's strong stance on ' secret corporate lobbying ' which he declared in 2010			1
in february 2010 , while leader of the opposition , he said : ' i believe that secret corporate lobbying , like the expenses scandal , goes to the heart of why people are so fed up with politics			1
‘ it arouses people ’s worst fears and suspicions about how our political system works , with money buying power , power fishing for money and a cosy club at the top making decisions in their own interest			2
' a @entity1 spokesman said : ' no donation was ever accepted or even formally considered by the @entity1			0
' all donations to the @entity1 have to comply with the requirements of electoral law			0
these are strictly enforced by our compliance department			0
' unlike the @entity43 , where union donations are traded for party policies , donations to the @entity1 do not buy party or government policy			2
' @entity43 challenged the prime minister to ' come clean ' about what he knew and when			0
' @entity196 and again the @entity1 party has been the obstacle to capping donations from wealthy individuals			0
now it appears obvious why , ' said @entity43 mp @entity202 who was speaking before mr @entity0 quit			1
' pensioners , the young unemployed and squeezed middle families can not afford to buy this sort of access or influence which is just another reason why this government is out of touch with the overwhelming majority of @entity70 people			1
' @entity3 should come clean			1
access : mr @entity0 said financiers who gave ' premier league ' donations could get access to mr @entity3 , possibly at venues such as the prime minister 's @entity220 retreat , @entity222 ' will the pm say exactly what he knew and when about an apparent effort to sell access and influence in @entity61 ? ' the @entity1 said @entity226 would be replaced in his post by @entity228 , a member of the @entity229 who had previously held the role			1
@entity231 chief secretary to the treasury @entity232 said mr @entity0 ’s comments were ' utterly disgraceful ' and made the case again for reform of party funding - an issue that came under scrutiny when @entity241 ’s government was embroiled in allegations that honours were awarded in return for cash for the @entity43			1
attempts at a cross-party consensus for reform have repeatedly foundered			0
@entity251 watchdog sir @entity249 warned today that the parties could ' duck the issue no longer '			0
mr @entity0 also told the @entity15 that mr @entity3 hosted major donors at receptions at his official @entity61 residence and at @entity258 , the location used in @entity70 television drama ' @entity261			1
' sir @entity249 , chairman of the independent @entity263 , said : ' it would be wrong to regard this as an isolated event			0
events like it are inevitable as long as the main political parties are dependent for their existence on large donations from rich individuals or , in the case of the @entity43 , a small number of trade unions			2
' the parties collectively need urgently to address the damage this does to confidence in the integrity of the political process			0
' all three of the major parties promised to end the ‘ big donor culture ’ in their manifestos for the last election			2
' the promise also featured in the @entity289 agreement			0
my @entity263 last autumn provided a blueprint for doing so which we believed to be both reasonably fair and sustainable and which , because we are an independent committee , was not distorted by thoughts of party political advantage			0
' nothing has so far happened			0
i imagine this is presumably because it requires all the parties to face up to some difficult issues which they would rather avoid			0
they should not be allowed to duck the issue any longer			0
' in november last year the topic of party funding became national news when a key committee warned that large financial contributors were being given ' preferential access to political decision makers '			2
the committee on standards in public life recommended that party donations be capped at a maximum if £ 10,000 each , while @entity1 co-chairman @entity316 told the committee : ' there is no question of individuals either influencing policy or gaining an unfair advantage by virtue of their financial contributions to the party			1
' the ' cash - for - access ' row involving @entity1 co-treasurer @entity0 evokes memories of political scandals past			2
two years ago , with @entity43 still in power , there was a row over so - called ' cash - for - influence ' when three former cabinet ministers were suspended from the @entity336 over allegations that they were prepared to take cash to influence government policy			2
@entity340 , @entity341 and @entity342 were filmed by @entity344 's dispatches programme discussing the possibility of working for what they thought was an @entity349 lobby firm			0
in 2010 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity340 were suspended from the @entity336 over allegations they were prepared to take cash to influence government policy in the middle of the decade was the ' cash - for - honours ' affair , which raised questions about the activities of the two biggest parties			2
alleged links between the granting of honours and financial support for parties dogged the last two years of @entity43 prime minister @entity241 's time at @entity367			0
an influential group of mps which considered the issue said in december 2007 that membership of the @entity229 should be decided by an independent body in a fully transparent process			0
the then chairman of the @entity375 , dr @entity376 , said that though no charges were brought over the scandal , trust in public life had been damaged			2
a police inquiry had followed a complaint by @entity384 mp @entity383 in 2006 that financial support was being rewarded with honours in contravention of a 1925 anti-corruption law			2
it had been reported that millionaires who gave large donations to the @entity43 and @entity1 parties were to be given peerages			2
during the inquiry , mr @entity241 became the first prime minister to be interviewed by police as part of a political corruption inquiry			0
the following year , after a £ 1.4 million , 19 - month investigation , the @entity399 announced that nobody would be charged , as there was no realistic prospect of a conviction .			0

@entity0 told undercover reporters that ' things will open up for you ' if they donated a large amount of money to the @entity12
financiers told they could meet pm at venues which might *include* @entity222
revelations come after @entity3 said in 2010 that ' secret corporate lobbying ' was ' next big scandal *waiting* to happen ' in @entity70 politics
@entity3 promises ' full inquiry ' into ' completely unacceptable ' claims by @entity226
@entity423 says idea that policy is for sale is ' grotesque '
