by @entity0 self - driving ‘ robo - cars ’ are to be allowed on @entity3 ’s roads from the @entity4 despite fears over their safety , the government announced yesterday			1
ministers are fast - tracking the measures , which pave the way for drivers to sit back and , ultimately , concentrate on other tasks as an on - board computer assumes command of the vehicle			2
the cars are guided by radar , laser sensors , cameras and sat - nav			1
they will take to public roads in @entity3 for the first time from january in a series of trials lasting up to three years			1
they have been joined by internet giant @entity36			0
all models are expected to have a manual override , allowing the driver to take control if necessary			0
the cars can be used in regular traffic either independently or as a ‘ road train ’ , where they work with other driverless vehicles to move through traffic as a convoy			2
in the @entity3 , self - drive mode may be restricted initially to certain roads , such as motorways , or specific lanes			1

the vehicles work by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s position on an electronic map significantly , much of the technology is already fitted to family cars – including self - braking , self - parking , lane recognition , cameras that can ‘ read ’ signs and adaptive cruise control , which adjusts speed to the traffic			2
the test for manufacturers is to link the technology via an on - board computer in a way that will meet safety legislation			0
the government will review road laws to enable driverless cars to be street legal			1
business secretary @entity52 announced the move after testing a vehicle at the headquarters of motor industry research organisation @entity81 at @entity82 in the @entity83			1
ministers have set aside £ 10million for trials in three cities			0
mr @entity52 said the announcement would put @entity3 ‘ at the forefront of this transformational technology and open up new opportunities for our economy and society ’			1
driverless cars are already in use in a number of countries , including @entity98 , @entity99 and the @entity100 , where four states have passed laws permitting autonomous cars			1
but there are many hurdles to overcome before they become a regular sight on @entity3 ’s roads			2
@entity109 president @entity108 was wary over the development			0
‘ cars have become more automated , ’ he said			0
‘ however , there needs to be a big leap of faith by drivers from embracing assistance systems to accepting the fully automated car			0
’ in a survey by @entity119 , 56 per cent of @entity3 adults said they would not purchase a driverless car and a quarter believed they would not be safe			2
there are suggestions that @entity3 ’s pot - holed roads are in such a state that the technology could not cope			1
insurers say there are challenges over liability if a self - driving car crashes , while academics warn that their computers could be ‘ hacked ’ and disabled , or even used by terrorists as a weapon			0
supporters say the cars will be safer than many motorists			0
safety experts often joke that the most dangerous part of any car is ‘ the nut behind the steering wheel ’ .			0

first trials of driverless cars on @entity3 roads will start from january 2015
the cars are guided by radar , laser sensors , cameras and sat - nav
