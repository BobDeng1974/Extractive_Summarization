by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 12 november 2013 a landscape gardener who built a wall on his own land has now been told it 's an ' obstruction ' by the local council which is making him pay £ 3,500 to have it torn down			1
@entity8 built the metre - high brick wall around his garden after buying a converted barn in @entity12 , @entity13			1
however , council officials claim that even though the 54 - year - old owns the land it 's built on , it must come down as it is obstructing the public highway and he had a ' duty ' not to build on it			1
anger : @entity8 has been ordered to tear down the garden wall he built at his home in @entity13 mr @entity8 moved in to the home with his partner and their two daughters in 2007 , and says he spent four months and £ 4,000 tidying up the adjacent plot of land by re-turfing the ground and erecting the garden wall			1
two years later , @entity32 ordered him to return the land to its original state by demolishing the wall and ripping up the turf			2
although he is the legal owner of the land , the council claims that part of it has traditionally been a public highway , meaning he has a duty not to build on it in order to allow unimpeded access for motorists and pedestrians			2
the wall is situated on a verge , with a gap of around 1ft between the wall and the road			2
legal battle : mr @entity8 has spent four years trying to prove to the council that he has the right to build ' obstruction ' : the council claims the wall is built on a public highway and is therefore illegal following a four - year legal battle , the council has now given mr @entity8 a month to tear down the wall or face a £ 3,500 bill for them to hire a contractor to do it			1
' all my neighbours think my wall and lawn look great and it really improves the look of the area , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' i ca n't see how the council can possibly think that ripping up my lawn and tearing down the wall is a good idea			2
' the wall 's been there for more than six years now			2
i just ca n't see what the problem is			0
i feel as though it 's @entity78 versus @entity79 , and i wo n't give in to these bullies			0
' when mr @entity8 's solicitor wrote to the council pointing out that he owned the land , they replied : ' the ownership is worthless to your client as it relates to the subsoil ownership only and does not supercede any highways rights that exist over the surface			1
' but the gardener said : ' i have taken a piece of land which i own and significantly improved it			0
if i did n't own it and had just tidied it up , it would still be ridiculous but i could understand			0
' but they want me to knock down my wall and rip up all of the turf on my own land			0
and the council have the cheek to bill me for the demolition , which they say is £ 3,500 plus a tipping charge			1
' letter : the council told mr @entity8 's lawyer that his ownership of the land is ' worthless ' deadline : the wall is due to be demolished later this month and mr @entity8 will have to pay he is now seeking an injunction to stop the council knocking down the wall , and says the case has already cost him £ 5,000			1
' i am not going to back down and i am prepared to take this to court , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' i know 100 per cent i will win my case as the wall is on my land and i have the papers to prove it			0
' there are so many abandoned and shabby properties which need demolishing which the council are n't interested in , but i try to make my small patch of land look neat and tidy and suddenly they want to knock it down			0
' it may seem petty to some people but this wall means the earth to me			0
i had it built to improve my land and i am fully within my rights as the landowner to do so			0
' a spokesman for @entity32 refused to comment , saying : ' this is currently a matter which is the subject for discussion between respective solicitors			0

mr @entity8 owns the land but council said he had a ' duty ' not to build on it
