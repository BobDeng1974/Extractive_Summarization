@entity0 has slumped to the same level of support that saw @entity3 ousted from @entity4			1
the party , under @entity7 leadership , is back at 29 per cent in the polls , trailing the conservatives on 30 per cent , according to a survey released by @entity11 this afternoon			1
in a further blow , more than a third of @entity0 voters would now prefer to see @entity15 as prime minister than mr @entity7 after the next election			1
the @entity0 is back at just 29 per cent in the polls - its lowest level since may 2010 when @entity3 lost the election among @entity0 supporters , 19 per cent are dissatisfied with mr @entity15 but would still prefer him as prime minister			1
a further 18 per cent are satisfied with the job he is doing in @entity4			0
the poll comes amid growing concern in the @entity0 over its dramatic slump in @entity27 , which one survey suggested could see mr @entity7 lose almost 40 seats north of the border			2
this week ’s @entity31 , conducted over the weekend , is the first time @entity0 has fallen below 30 per cent under mr @entity7 ’s leadership			1
@entity34 were down two points to 16 per cent , while the @entity36 were up three to 10 cent - the first time they have broken into double figures in lord @entity11 ’s surveys			0
the @entity40 , meanwhile , are up one point at 6 per cent and the @entity42 have 5 per cent , despite only standing in @entity27			0
lord @entity11 said @entity0 were ‘ continuing their slow but unmistakeable decline from highs of 36 per cent in july and 35 per cent in early september ’			0
he added : ‘ this is the first week in which @entity0 have dropped below 30 per cent in my poll , and the second time the two leading parties have scored less than 60 per cent between them			0
’ mr @entity7 's personal ratings are hampering @entity0 's overall support , lord @entity11 's survey has suggested while the @entity0 is at the same level of support as 2010 , the conservatives and @entity36 have both seen their support collapse			2
@entity34 and the @entity40 meanwhile have seen their support surge in lord @entity11 ’s poll on july 14 , @entity0 were picking up 31 per cent of 2010 @entity36 voters , while shedding just 12 per cent of their own supporters at the last election to @entity34 and the @entity40			2
this week , only 26 per cent of former @entity36 naming a party said they would vote @entity0 , while 11 per cent had switched to @entity34 and five per cent to the @entity40			0
at the same time , the @entity42 ’s share in @entity27 has more than doubled , mostly at the expense of @entity0			0
according to @entity11 there is further bad news for @entity0 as voters continue to prefer mr @entity15 as prime minister by wide margins			2
overall 61 per cent said they preferred mr @entity15 as prime minister , whether they were satisfied or not with his performance			0
the @entity0 leader is facing an uphill battle to become prime minister after the next election , but has insisted mr @entity15 can not win a majority less than a quarter ( 24 per cent , down four points ) said they would rather see mr @entity7 as prime minister , including just one in five swing voters and only 13 per cent of @entity34 supporters			1
only 55 per cent of @entity0 voters said they would rather see @entity7 in @entity4			1
one in four voters say they would be better off if the @entity83 were in power after the next election – compared to just 16 per cent who said a @entity0 government would leave them in a better position			1
a third of @entity34 voters were much more likely to think they would be better off with the conservatives than under @entity0 – with only six per cent of @entity93 supporters saying a @entity0 government would be better for them .			0

@entity0 are back to 29 ***%*** in the polls , behind the @entity83 on 30 ***%***
@entity3 lost the last *general* election with just 29 ***%*** of the votes
@entity7 is also *struggling* to win over his own supporters
two in 10 @entity0 voters *unhappy* with @entity15 but do *n't* want @entity104
