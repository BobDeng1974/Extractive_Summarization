by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:59 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 29 november 2012 top @entity2 including @entity4 aides hinted that they may use concessions on taxes and government benefit cuts as bargaining tools while dealing with @entity9 in order to avoid the ‘ fiscal cliff ’			1
such compromises would be welcome by @entity9 , who agree with @entity4 speaker @entity14 ’s proposition that they would agree to higher tax revenues if they were suggested in a deal that included cuts to benefit programs			1
the goal of the talks is to produce a long - term deficit - cutting deal that will allow the cancellation of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year - the ' fiscal cliff ' that numerous economists say threaten a new recession			1
' it 's too important for @entity45 to screw this up , ' he declared			0
the fiscal cliff is the ominous heading given to the group of tax cuts for all but the country ’s highest earners as well as the funding to a collection of government benefit programs are all due to expire at the end of this year , and if the government does n’t find ways to make up for those budget disparities they will not continue into 2013			1
for all the talk , there was no sign of tangible progress on an issue that marks a first test for divided government since elections that assured @entity32 a second term in the @entity4 while renewing @entity9 control in the @entity4			2
' it 's time for the president and @entity2 to get serious about the spending problem that our country has , ' @entity14 said at a news conference			2
the leading @entity9 , like @entity32 , expressed optimism that a deal could be reached			1
appealing to the masses : president @entity32 hoped to earn support over social media rallying : though he said that he was willing to compromise and work together , @entity32 called @entity81 out at the same time , he publicly disagreed with one @entity9 lawmaker , rep. @entity82 of @entity83 , who said he was ready to go along with @entity32 's plan to renew most but not all of the expiring income tax cuts			1
' it 'll hurt the economy ' to raise rates for anyone , said @entity14			0
separately , at a closed - door meeting with the rank and file members of his party , the speaker told fellow @entity9 they are on solid political ground in refusing to let tax rates rise			2
he circulated polling data showing the public favors closing loopholes to raise revenue far more than it supports raising rates on incomes over $ 250,000			0
on wednesday , a group of corporate ceos pushing for a deal met separately with top @entity2 and @entity9 leaders in the @entity4 , joined by @entity108 who was co-chairman of a deficit commission @entity32 appointed earlier in his term			2
@entity112 message : ' it 's time for the president and @entity2 to get serious about the spending problem that our country has , ' house speaker @entity14 said speaking to reporters before a session with business leaders , @entity119 @entity118 of @entity120 said the bargaining ought to begin where deficit talks between @entity32 and @entity14 broke down 18 months ago ' and go from there to reach an agreement			1
' starting point : it is believed that @entity32 and @entity14 were close to striking a deal last year and may begin their negotiations there she did n't say so , but at the time , the two men were exchanging offers that called for at least $ 250billion in cuts over a decade from @entity139 , the popular government health care program for the elderly , and another $ 100billion from @entity142 , the health care program for the poor			1
among the changes under discussion - with @entity32 's approval - was a gradual increase in the eligibility age for @entity139 from 65 to 67 , as well as higher fees for beneficiaries			1
also on the table at the time was a plan to curtail future cost - of - living increases for @entity155 , the government pension program , and other benefit programs			0
those negotiations faltered in a hail of recriminations after the president upped his demand for additional tax revenue and conservatives balked			2
at the same time liberals were objecting to savings from @entity139 and @entity155			0
now , more than a year and one election later , @entity32 has said repeatedly he is open to alternatives to his current proposal to raise additional tax revenue			2
but he also says he will refuse to sign legislation that extends the current top rates on incomes over $ 200,000 for individuals and $ 250,000 for couples			0
coming together : @entity108 , former co-chairman of a deficit commission @entity32 appointed earlier in his term , joined a group of @entity180 and republicans who met on @entity182 on wednesday instead , he is pushing @entity81 to renew expiring tax cuts for all income below those levels as an interim measure - an offer @entity14 and @entity9 generally say is unacceptable because it would mean higher taxes on small business owners			1
@entity108 said during the day that @entity32 might be willing to back off his demand that the top rate revert all the way from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent , where it was a decade ago before tax cuts sought by then - president @entity196 took effect			1
at the @entity4 , spokesman @entity198 sidestepped questions			0
' if i told you how much flexibility the president had , it would eliminate his flexibility , ' he said			0
while the obstacles are numerous , there are other political imperatives pushing the two sides toward an agreement			0
unemployment benefits expire for some of the long - term jobless at the end of the year			0
additionally the government is expected to need an increase in borrowing authority early next year or face the possibility of a default			0
any agreement on that is expected to raise the current $ 16.4trillion level .			0

president @entity32 and @entity9 house speaker @entity14 both said they were willing to compromise to find ways to avoid the dramatic tax and benefit spending cuts that will come at the end of the year
