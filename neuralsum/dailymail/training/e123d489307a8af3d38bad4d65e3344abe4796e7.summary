with the @entity2 recruiting @entity3 to replace @entity4 , football punditry is set for a major change this season - but perhaps not as much as @entity6 suggest in their newest @entity8 advert			0
fictional @entity10 coach @entity9 , who starred in last season 's video as @entity14 's new manager , is back in the studio , and still completely out of his depth in the hilarious clip			1
in the video @entity9 , played by @entity18 , has returned from his disastrous managerial career in @entity21 to work for @entity6 on their @entity8 coverage			2
@entity18 ' character also drinks with a group of @entity49 fans whilst wearing a @entity14 shirt and talks about how much he misses @entity53			0
but the highlight of the six - minute clip is undoubtedly a meeting with @entity57 , to whom @entity9 complains ' i think i literally think i have a better understanding of who killed @entity61 than i do of offside '			0
fitting in : coach @entity9 is often seen in a @entity14 shirt - even when surrounded by @entity49 fans guest star : the advert also features a cameo from @entity57 , who starred for the @entity10 at the @entity68			1

fictional coach @entity9 first appeared in adverts as @entity14 manager last year
after ' six and a half hour ' stay in @entity21 the @entity10 is now back in the @entity74
coach @entity9 makes his punditry *bow* for @entity6 's @entity8 coverage in new advert
@entity9 meets @entity78 star @entity57 before getting a *surprising* new *job*
