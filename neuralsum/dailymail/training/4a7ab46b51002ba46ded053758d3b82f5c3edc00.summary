the beautifully written note accompanied the first - ever bound copy of @entity2 ' first novel , the @entity10			1
dated monday evening , december 11 1837 , the letter is written to his friend and later biographer @entity13 , offering him a copy of the literature			1
unique : the beautifully crafted letter from @entity2 ' addressed to his friend and biographer @entity13 is set to go on sale a first bound edition of @entity10 from 1837			1
it was originally published as a 20 - part serial it reads : ' @entity25 , @entity26 have just sent me three extra super bound copies of @entity10 - as per specimen enclosed			1
the first i forward to you , the second i have presented to a good friend @entity32 and the third @entity33 has retained for herself			2
accept your copy , with kind regards , from your affectionate friend @entity2			1
' @entity10 was @entity2 ' first work to receive public acclaim			1
written at the tender age of 24 , @entity2 balanced writing this episodic work with his job as a court reporter			2
@entity26 approached @entity2 with their concept of writing lines to accompany their comic ' cockney sporting plates ' by illustrator @entity47			2
however , @entity2 rarely adjusted his narrative to plates that had been prepared for him			2
typically , he himself led the way with an installment of his story , and the artist was compelled to illustrate what @entity2 had already written			2
the story thus became the prime source of interest , and the illustrations merely of secondary importance			2
the serialisation of @entity10 launched @entity2 as an international literary celebrity literary genesis : @entity10 was @entity2 ' first work to receive public acclaim by this reversal of interest , @entity2 transformed , at a stroke , a current type of fiction , consisting mostly of pictures , into a novel of contemporary @entity74 life			1
while still working on his @entity10 ( 1836 - 37 ) , @entity2 was contracted to write two more novels and started publishing @entity76 ( 1837 - 38 )			1
@entity78 @entity77 , who will be selling the letter at auction on friday in @entity81 , said : ' this letter , written by @entity2 himself , is a rare and fascinating thing			1

keen to share his first work with his dear friend and biographer @entity13 , historical novelist @entity93 , and his wife , @entity33 , this would have been frantically scribbled and swiftly put in the post			1
' long career : @entity2 was a prolific writer during more than 30 years as an author @entity2 , the greatest novelist of the @entity3 era , was yet to discover fame as an author when he excitedly wrote the letter above			0
born in @entity103 in 1812 , he left school early to work in a factory and had little education			0
his anger at the conditions that working class people had to live in became major themes of his work			0
his experience working in a blacking factory was never forgotten and inspired two of his novels ' @entity115 ' and ' @entity117 '			0
during his career he edited weekly journals , wrote 15 novels and five novellas as well as hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles			0
like many others , he began his career as a journalist			0
