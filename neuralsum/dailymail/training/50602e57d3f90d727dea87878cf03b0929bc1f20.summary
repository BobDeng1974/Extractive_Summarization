it was more her breathing than anything else but she could still do her shopping			0
@entity55 heard how the 55 - year - old grandmother had got drunk on the night of her death although her daughter denied she was an alcoholic ' she used to tell me if she used her stair lift she would lose the use of her legs , so she did n’t go on it very often			1
' @entity64 was n’t an alcoholic but she did have three or four bottles of wine a week			0
' i would go round in the day and thought she had had a drink , but when i asked her she said she had n’t			2
