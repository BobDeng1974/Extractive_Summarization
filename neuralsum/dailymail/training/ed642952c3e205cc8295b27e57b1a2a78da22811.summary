in actual fact @entity3 and the @entity43 team were hailed as @entity129 heroes			0
despite criticism of the expedition more than 50 years later , @entity3 's attempt is thought of today as a feat of endurance in an age of heroic polar exploration			0
@entity55 's specialist , mr @entity57 , said : ' with hindsight , it feels as if it was always a given that the death of @entity3 and his companions would be hailed as a paradigm of @entity129 heroism , but the letters show us the real fear amongst the expedition members that they would be received as failures			2
