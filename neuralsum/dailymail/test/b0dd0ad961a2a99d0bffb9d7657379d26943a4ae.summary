@entity0 insists he is ready for @entity2 's tactics should his @entity4 team - mate attempt anything underhand in the wake of his latest outburst			1
@entity2 's criticism of @entity8 following sunday 's @entity9 has reopened old wounds that at times festered between the duo last year			1
the 29 - year - old @entity13 claimed @entity0 selfishly slowed during the middle part of the race , drawing him back into a chasing @entity17 in his @entity18			1
@entity0 ( right ) insists he is prepared for further criticism from @entity20 's team - mate @entity2 @entity0 beat his @entity4 colleague to win the @entity9 in @entity22 on sunday @entity4 top brass @entity23 and @entity25 insist @entity0 was not at fault , with the eventual one - two the best result for the team			1
with @entity2 distinctly second best to @entity0 so far this season - as he has been out - qualified and out - raced by the @entity30 in all three grands prix - it remains to be seen what tricks he might have up his sleeve to stop the rot and regain the advantage			2
in @entity37 last year it has been suggested by many @entity2 deliberately thwarted @entity0 during qualifying , earning pole and following up with the race win			2
in @entity41 , @entity2 earned a rebuke and had sanctions imposed on him by the team after colliding with @entity0 on only the second lap which forced the latter out of the race			1
@entity0 ( right ) led @entity2 at the @entity9 , and later came under criticism from his team - mate the @entity52 racer , who leads the @entity54 ' championship by 13 points , sprays champagne on a hostess although aware @entity2 may do all he can to beat him , an unperturbed @entity0 said : ' i feel pretty well prepared , having experienced all those kind of things			1
' that stuff does n't cross my mind			2
i think we 're professional			0
we 've been through some ups and downs and now we 're in a good place			0
' and anyway , i would like to think i am stronger this year and that will be reflected moving forwards			0
' the bottom line is at present @entity2 does not have an answer for @entity0 's form and pace as the 30 - year - old has won eight of the last 10 races			1
@entity0 has also suggested @entity2 should seize a chance when it is presented to him , as was the case in @entity22			1
@entity0 claimed after the race that @entity2 ( left ) was not quick enough to catch him even if he tried the @entity9 in @entity22 finished with a @entity4 one - two , and @entity17 third for @entity18 ' you have to try and sympathise with people 's opinions , ' said @entity0			1
' i always try , in all walks of life , to put myself in that position because you would n't want that to happen to you			2
you try to think that			0
' but i said to the guys , if i was in second and i had the pace i had , i would have been pushing to be as close as possible and passing			0
' they said maybe he was just comfortable second , and i said " well , that 's the difference between us			2
i want to win always "			0
' i would have done everything to get past , or at least pushed for three laps if i could			0
' @entity0 drives during the @entity97 race at the @entity98 on april 12 but then cuttingly , @entity0 added : ' even if he had ( pushed ) , and he had got relatively close , he just was n't quick enough			1
' if you take a step back , this is motor racing , man			0
do n't take away the fun of the racing			2
' if i was in second or third , i would have done everything			0
i would n't have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint			0
' of course you want to get to the end of the stint , but if i thought i had more pace i would have tried to have got past , because that 's the best part			0
