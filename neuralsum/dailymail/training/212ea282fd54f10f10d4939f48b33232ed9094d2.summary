@entity5 , who thought that she had been saved by the judges then faced uncertainty as the results of the viewers votes were read out			1
first goodbye : @entity4 gives @entity5 a hug as she 's says goodbye to the show that she 's worked so hard to be part of emotional : @entity4 leaves the stage after an emotional showdown and harsh criticism form @entity17 while the 32 - year - old singer , who got through to @entity93 last year , was magnanimous in defeat , her mentor was n't as he angrily glared at @entity23 before storming out of the auditorium			1
speaking backstage , @entity17 called the outcome an ' absolute joke ' , telling his act that ' two years running you 've lost out to joke acts ' , a sentiment pointing to the fact that she narrowly missed getting to the live rounds last year when she originally applied for the show			1

and @entity188 also performed for the lively crowd following his performance earlier in the day at the @entity191			0
it was a good night for chimney sweep @entity193 , who impressed all of the judges , while one of the big stand out acts came in the form of 16 - year - old @entity179 , who wowed with her rendition of @entity35 's @entity183			0
taking their places : @entity17 , @entity44 , @entity43 and @entity49 were all friendly at the start of the night before the controversy singing his heart out : @entity193 was one of the favourites following his performance during the first live show star act : former x factor winner @entity158 made her return to the show on sunday night dressed in a flamboyant purple gown to sing her new track , @entity214 she 's back : @entity158 chatted to @entity59 as she made her comeback showing the new contestants how it 's done opening the show : at the start of the live programme all of the acts sang together for the group song - and sang it live for the first time compared to other years her vocals even led to @entity17 commenting straight afterwards : ' i 've got to be honest			2
