by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:05 am on 29th june 2011 inquiry : @entity3 for the @entity5 @entity4 wants an investigation into two @entity7 an mep has demanded an inquiry into claims two @entity12 hospitals passed on confidential patient medical records to ambulance chasing lawyers			1
@entity4 , @entity3 for the @entity5 , said he had heard complaints from constituents bombarded with messages from personal injury law firms after hospital treatment			1
the claims have emerged as insurance company @entity21 announced it would no longer accept referral fees from law firms and called for reform to whiplash damages			1
' @entity21 hopes this action is a first step in a journey to reform the emerging compensation culture which is spiralling out of control and encourages @entity33 to ban referral fees completely , ' the company said in a statement			1
the developments come the day after the @entity37 revealed that police are raking in millions of pounds from selling on the details of drivers who have had a road accident			0
a mail investigation found that police officers are often the first link in a chain of tip offs and kick backs as police , insurance companies , unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms conspire to exploit powerless motorists			1
@entity53 mep mr @entity4 demanded an inquiry into the @entity55 and @entity56 after he was approached by constituents who feared their confidentiality had been breached in the same way			0
' the only way the claims firms can have got the information that they had been a patient and also got their mobile phone numbers is from the hospital itself , ' he said			0
' i do n't know if that is being done with the connivance of the hospital trusts concerned - @entity55 and the @entity56 - or whether some staff are doing this off their own bat			1
' but i want to know and this must be stopped			0
i know that hospital trusts everywhere are having to make budget cuts but if they are selling this highly private information to boost their coffers it is an outrage and must contravene the @entity80			0
' @entity81 turned to profit : police , insurance companies unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms apparently conspire to exploit powerless motorists			1
( @entity88 image ) @entity21 's announcement over payments from personal injury lawyers came as anger over the effect the @entity93 's growing ' compensation culture ' has had on car insurance premiums bubbled over today			1
the insurer , one of the world 's largest , singled out the problem of compensation for whiplash injuries - which are almost undetectable			1
in particular , they highlighted the unscrupulous practice of motorists being encouraged to make claims several years after an accident			0
after such a long time has passed it is almost impossible to verify what injury has been sustained , particularly when no injury was claimed at the time			1
@entity111 , @entity112 ceo , @entity21 @entity93 , said : ' as one of the leading insurance providers , we have decided that the only way to address the problem adequately is to lead by example			1
' over the last few years we have seen an exponential rise in personal injury claims – especially soft tissue injuries – whilst evidence suggests road accidents are decreasing			1
' we have also seen a significant rise in claims made some years after the event which are therefore impossible to prove or to defend			2
' ' racket ' : police are raking in millions of pounds from cynically selling on the details of drivers who have had a road accident ( file photograph ) yesterday the @entity37 revealed police forces were running a ' huge racket ' in which they cynically sell on the details of drivers who have had a road accident			0
officers tip off preferred local garages and breakdown firms - who come to collect the car , then hit motorists with removal and storage charges			1
for this service , the police demand a so - called ' administration fee ' of up to £ 25 per vehicle			1
details of this and other dubious practices emerged amid a blazing row over the way police , insurance companies , unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms conspire to exploit powerless motorists			1
insurers blame unnecessary police charges and the compensation culture - which has seen damages claims for trivial or imagined injuries spiral - for the soaring increases in the annual premiums they charge all drivers			2
but they too stand accused of being deeply involved in the racket			0
according to ex-justice secretary @entity170 , insurance companies are selling details of their own clients to ' no - win , no - fee lawyers ' for up to £ 1,000 per person			1
these ' claims managers ' then bombard the motorist with unwanted texts and phone calls offering to help them to pursue compensation claims for often non-existent injuries			0
some 80 per cent of all claims are for ' whiplash ' which is conveniently undetectable by scans or x-rays			0
the cost of settling the spiralling bill for personal injury claims is immediately passed on to the driver in higher premiums - while insurers are allowed to keep their lucrative ' referral ' fee			1
mr @entity170 said yesterday that the entire system had become a ' huge racket ' and that the insurance industry saw it as ' our dirty little secret '			2
he added : ' the garages , the recovery firms - even the police are selling on this information			2
' the information commissioner receives 100 complaints every month from motorists bombarded with phone calls and texts urging them to claim compensation			0
@entity210 has begun an investigation into whether the tactic is a breach of data protection laws			0
insurers are expected to defend themselves by pointing out that , on insurance renewal forms , they warn that a client 's personal information could be passed on to ' relevant third parties '			1
mr @entity210 wants to establish if this could reasonably be understood to mean claims handling companies			0
if he decides it does not , insurers could be found in breach of the @entity80			0
the police tactic of obtaining referral fees from local garages is legal because they insist that the information goes no further			2
garages are told they will be in breach of the @entity80 if they contact any third party			0
the police 's role was revealed in evidence to the @entity237 , obtained by mr @entity170			0
it shows that , when a car can not be driven away from the scene of an accident , police who arrive quickly make a call to a local garage or breakdown company			2
forces , who have agreed a fee in advance , then receive a ' tip off ' or ' referral fee ranging from £ 5 - £ 25			1
in one year , @entity252 raked in an estimated £ 622,275 from contractors ' tip - off payments , in relation to 24,891 vehicles			1
@entity257 ' referred ' 32,855 cars to breakdown companies in 2009 , but refused to reveal the amount it received , claiming disclosure could ' damage the commercial interest of third parties '			0
police claim the money is necessary to cover ' admin ' fees - but not all forces choose to charge a fee			1
the evidence was compiled by the insurer swiftcover.com , using @entity273 requests			0
it approached nine forces - only two of which said they did not charge a ' referral ' fee for arranging the collection of cars involved in an accident or unfit to drive after breaking down			2
based on these figures , more than three - quarters of the 54 forces in @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 are likely to be pocketing a fee			2
the value to the police could be tens of millions of pounds			0
in evidence to mps , swiftcover said : ' when the insurer is told about the collection , it has to arrange a further collection of the vehicle from a recovery centre , owned by a third party			0
' this incurs additional , unnecessary costs to the insurer and therefore policyholders			0
' they say drivers should themselves call the insurance company , to avoid police getting in first			1
police say they ensure the garages agree not to pass on the details of motorists to other companies			0
but claims managers say there is evidence of garages ignoring these rules , despite it being a breach of data protection law			0
incredibly , the tactics being used by the insurers themselves are legal			0
buried away in the small - print of insurance documents , motorists are asked to agree for their details to be passed on to ' relevant third parties '			1
insurers have taken this to be a green - light for them to sell the names and other personal information of a crash victims to a claims manager for £ 200 - £ 1,000			1
claims firms then encourage crash victims to make compensation bids for injuries such as whiplash , even when they have not been hurt , according to the investigation by mr @entity170			0
the motorist can receive a pay - out of thousands of pounds - but premiums are driven up			2
research : mp @entity170 found insurance companies selling details in 2009 , the number of road accidents involving personal injury was 31 per cent down on the average for 1994 - 98			1
but the cost of personal injury claims has doubled in ten years - from £ 7billion to £ 14billion - and motor insurance premiums have shot up , by at least 30 per cent in the last year			1
mr @entity170 wants the ' referral ' fees banned			2
he says insurers have admitted to him that the fact they are charging ' referrals ' is the industry 's ' dirty secret '			0
but yesterday insurers remained defiant - saying they will carry - on selling drivers ' personal data until such time as a ban is imposed			1
the @entity367 , said : ' if they [ insurers ] stopped taking this money , everyone else would be taking it - which is why they have to be banned outright			2
' @entity371 , of solicitors @entity373 , said : ' finally someone has realised it is the insurance industry who have been screwing the system more than anyone else			2
' the @entity379 said it was down to individual forces to decide how much they charged , but they were doing nothing wrong			0
but @entity384 , spokesman for the @entity385 - a trade body representing 120 claims management firms - said : ' we are aware police officers , nurses , doctors , ambulance men and women have sold details of accident victims to claims management companies			2
' @entity379 insisted : ' we do not sell the details of people involved in accidents to compensation lawyers			0

insurance company @entity21 announces it will stop accepting fees from personal injury lawyers
@entity252 alone made over £ 622,000 in a year from contractor tip - off fees over 24,891 vehicles
