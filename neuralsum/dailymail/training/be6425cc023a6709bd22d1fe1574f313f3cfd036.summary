by @entity0 transplant surgeons are using a pioneering technology that keeps a donor heart pumping outside the body			1
dubbed the ‘ heart in a box ’ , the device keeps the organ ‘ alive ’ from the moment it is removed until it is placed in a recipient			1
traditionally , all donor organs are placed in a cool - box and surrounded by ice to prevent them deteriorating on their journey between hospitals			0
not only does this extend how long a donor heart can be kept outside the body , but it allows specialists to assess if it is suitable for transplant			1
saving lives : the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , developed by @entity25 , allows donor hearts to continue functioning in a near - perfect state outside the body during transport but over the past 12 months , surgeons at @entity32 , @entity33 , have carried out 25 heart transplant operations in which the patient received an organ that had been transported and prepared for transplantation using the groundbreaking @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
it simulates the conditions of the human body , pumping oxygenated blood inside the heart so it can continue to function as it would inside a living person			1
the technology increases the time the organ can be maintained outside the body to at least eight hours , compared with a maximum of three to four hours on ice			1
this means hearts can be retrieved from further afield			0
@entity54 began using the technology in february last year because of the number of organs that surgeons were forced to decline due to distance			0
the hospital has since been able to accept what are known as ‘ marginal ’ organs , which might usually have been deemed too risky for the recipient			0
heart in a box : the device keeps the organ ' alive ' from the moment it is removed from a donor 's body until it is placed in the body of a recipient the heart in a box also allows surgeons to assess whether the donor heart is suitable for transplantation			1
it is harder to assess a non-beating heart and mistakes can be made about suitability			0
the technology has already prevented patients from receiving a donor heart that will not work and could put their life at risk			2
surgeons often start opening up a patient to receive a donor heart before the organ has arrived because of the limited time they have to get it into the recipient			1
saving lives : the @entity26 increases the time an organ can be outside a body to at least eight hours this is particularly relevant where patients have been kept alive on an artificial heart , another type of device that is ‘ plumbed into ’ the body , taking over the functions of the organ			1
because this involves further surgery , more time is needed to get these patients ready for transplant , so often a heart will be given to a person who can be operated on faster			2
between january 2010 and december 2013 , there were 271 long - term devices implanted into adult patients across the @entity117			0
however , only 47 patients with these devices received a heart transplant in the same period			0
since @entity54 began using @entity26 , it has been able to operate on 17 artificial heart patients compared with just seven in the previous three years			2
@entity123 , consultant surgeon and director of transplantation at the @entity125 and @entity54 , said the heart in a box had enabled the hospital to carry out more transplants			0
‘ put simply , it means that patients at @entity54 have had life - saving heart transplants which otherwise would not have been possible , primarily because we have travelled greater distances to retrieve an organ and have been able to transplant many more patients who already have an implanted device keeping them alive			2
‘ for us , the @entity26 technology has become the gold standard for organ retrieval			2
' it means we can treat more patients and has resulted in patients spending less time on intensive care and in hospital post transplant compared with previous years			0
' we have also reduced the incidence of post-transplant heart failure			0

@entity26 keeps heart ' alive ' from donor to recipient
machines make hearts beat and lungs breathe using donor blood
increases time organ can be outside a body to at least eight hours
