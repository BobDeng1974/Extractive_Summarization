@entity2 , who is of @entity4 origin but lives and works in @entity6 , was traveling to @entity7 to meet his family for an annual pilgrimage that involves a week ' visiting temples , praying ' and spending time with friends and relatives			1
but he ended up being detained for four hours at @entity22 , according to a blog post that has since gone viral , and was questioned by @entity15 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 before @entity12 refused to let him board the plane			1
the ordeal began when @entity2 , a data scientist who has worked at @entity31 , declined to go through the airport 's milimeter wave detector , something he regularly does as a frequent flyer , and opted for a routine pat down instead			1
during the procedure , @entity2 's hands were swabbed with a ' cotton - like material ' used to check for explosive residue			2
for some reason , he thinks it may have been anti-bedbug spray he had used the previous day while moving house , @entity2 's sample set off the machine , sparking a frightening series of events for the young man			1
in his extensive blog post entitled ' @entity51 , ' he explains how he was quizzed extensively about his vacation , and the interrogation intensified once he revealed he and his family would be ' visiting some temples			0
' the week he was traveling just happened to be the last week of @entity55 , which he believes may have had the authorities and the airline on particular edge as he thinks they thought he was @entity60			1
he describes how he was detained for hours without food or water and interrogated by nearly every federal law enforcement agency			2
' you 'll have to understand , when a person of your ... background walks into here , traveling alone , and sets off our alarms , people start to get a bit nervous , ' one @entity25 agent told him , he writes			2
' i 'm sure you 've been following what 's been going on in the news recently			0
you 've got people from five different branches of government all in here - we do n't do this just for fun			0
' @entity12 : ' we regret the embarrassment and inconvenience this caused our customer but stand by our crewmember 's decision , ' @entity12 said in a tweet but he said the thing that upset him the most was how @entity12 treated him , after he had been cleared by authorities to fly			1
he explained that after the fourth time he was patted down , a female @entity15 agent asked for his baggage claim ticket			2
' i handed it to her , and she told me that a woman from @entity12 corporate security needed to ask me some questions as well			1
i was a bit surprised , but agreed			0
' he said the @entity12 representative walked in and introduced herself by name before asking him whether he had flown @entity12 before			2
' yes , ' he said			0
she relied ' how often ? ' and he said about 10 times			0
she paused , then asked , ' will you have any trouble following the instructions of the crew and flight attendants on board the flight ? ' shocked as to why this would be in doubt , he replied ' no. ' ' we have some female flight attendants			0
would you be able to follow their instructions ? ' she went on to say			0
@entity2 wrote in the blog : ' i was almost insulted by the question , but i answered calmly , " yes , i can do that			2
" ' viral : the passenger 's blog post has gone viral since the event and prompted a firestorm on @entity12 's @entity135 account ' okay , ' she continued , ' and will you need any special treatment during your flight ? do you need a special place to pray on board the aircraft ? ' he wrote : ' only here did it hit me , ' referring to the fact the woman seemed to think he was @entity60			1
he said he responded ' no , ' with a light - hearted chuckle , ' trying to conceal any sign of how offensive her questions were ' and then thanked her anyway			0
' she left the room , again , leaving me alone for another ten minutes or so			0
when she finally returned , she told me that i had passed the @entity15 's inspection			1
" however , based on the responses you 've given to questions , we 're not going to permit you to fly today			0
" ' @entity2 stood in disbelief			0
the @entity15 and the @entity24 had cleared him to board the plane , ' but @entity12 had decided to ground me , ' he wrote			1
@entity12 agreed to refund his ticket , but would n't allow him to fly that day , forcing him to purchase a ticket with another airline that cost him an additional $ 700			1
@entity2 's post went viral on thursday , prompting a barrage of angry tweets to @entity12 's @entity135 account			1
' we do n't control security screening , ' @entity12 's account handler told one critic demanding an explanation			1
' we regret the embarrassment and inconvenience this caused our customer but stand by our crewmember 's decision , ' the carrier told person			0
a third tweet blamed @entity2 's ' disposition at the time ' for the decision to ban him from boarding			0
a @entity12 spokesperson told @entity188 on friday : ' we stand by our decision			2

@entity2 , who is of @entity4 origin but lives and works in @entity6 , said he was detained for four hours before @entity12 told him he could n't fly that day
the ordeal began when @entity2 tested positive to certain explosives , he believes due to anti-bedbug spray
@entity15 cleared him to fly but @entity12 refused to let him board after asking him whether he ' needed a special place to pray on board the aircraft '
he believes he was treated the way he was because authorities and the airline believed he was a *muslim* and he was traveling during @entity55
