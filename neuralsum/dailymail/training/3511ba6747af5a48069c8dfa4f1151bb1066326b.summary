by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 03:57 est , 26 november 2012 @entity1 was once a luxury item - but these days you can buy jumpers in the material in almost every @entity7 shop , from @entity8 to @entity9 , @entity10 to @entity11			1
the cheap cashmere revolution started in 2005 when import quotas were relaxed and @entity14 started exporting huge volumes of it to the @entity17			1
the lower end of the market still tends to be dominated by fibres from @entity14 goats			1
@entity0 investigates the truth behind cut - price cashmere ... in spring , the cashmere fibres - finer and softer , yet more durable , than wool - are collected from the underbelly of the goat , by combing or shearing			2
after washing , the finest , softest hair is separated from the coarser , outer guard hair			2
this guard hair is not considered high enough quality for many top - end manufacturers , but , according to industry expert @entity35 , of @entity36 , it 's this sort you 're likely to find on the @entity7			2
' you get what you pay for , ' he says			2
' a kilo of fibre , which when spun will make three sweaters , costs around £ 100			2
if you 're buying a sweater for £ 50 , you can be fairly sure that it has n't got the highest quality fibre in it			2
' if you do n't care about your jumper lasting , that might not be a problem , but pilling or bobbling tends to be just one of the issues with cheaper , shorter fibres			2
' if you 're using longer fibres , they tend not to pill in the same way , but short fibres easily roll themselves into balls , ' says mr @entity35			2
another way to cut costs is to knit the garment more loosely , giving a lighter garment that wo n't hold its shape as well			2
' a traditional cashmere jumper will weigh around 300g , ' says @entity35			2
' the sort of cheaper jumpers we see coming from @entity14 are closer to 200g			2
' but while a top - end cashmere sweater can sell for anything from £ 200 to £ 300 , on the @entity7 the prices are all under £ 100 , ranging from @entity9 's £ 40 to @entity74 's £ 89.95			1
to find out how they measured up , we asked @entity77 , a company that specialises in testing fabrics for the textile industry , to blind test jumpers from eight @entity7 stores			1
the results were unexpected ... the tests we checked five variables to find out : 1			0
is it really cashmere ? high - powered microscopes were used to check that the samples had n't been supplemented with wool , angora or any other fibre			0
all of our jumpers came out as 100 per cent cashmere			0
will it lose its shape ? while washing instructions ranged from ' dry clean only ' to ' machine wash at 40c ' , as most people wash cashmere on a cool machine cycle , we laundered all the jumpers at 30c and let them dry flat			0
they were measured before and after washing to see how well they kept their shape			0
' most retailers would n't put up with change of more than about 5 per cent maximum , ' says @entity110 from the testing laboratory			0
does it hold its colour ? a sample of each jumper was washed at @entity116 with strips of different white fabrics			0
the strips were checked for any colour , and the sample was checked to see if it had lost colour			0
the results for each fabric and the original sample are graded and we then averaged them out to give a percentage for colour fastness			0
will it go bobbly ? a sample is repeatedly rubbed to see to what extent it pills , or bobbles			0
the result is given a rating from one ( the worst ) to five ( the best )			0
' you 'd hope for a figure of at least four , ' says @entity110			0
@entity140 also weighed all the jumpers to give us a rough idea of how much cashmere had been used			0
@entity146 v - neck , £ 79.90 grey v - neck , £ 79.90 washing instructions : dry clean weight : 174g colour fastness : 100 % resistance to pilling : 3/5 shrinkage after washing : width -4.1 % , length -3.2 % , sleeve length +2.9 % fit : quite slim fitting , with a bit of extra length in the arms			1
i 'd probably go for a size up and roll the sleeves back			0
verdict : this was the overall winner of our test , coming out joint best for pilling and , despite the dry clean only label , best when it came to keeping its shape and its colour - although as it was one of the lightest jumpers we tried , that might have swayed the result			1
keep an eye out for cut - price promotions as @entity146 often mark these jumpers down , making them even better value			1
score : 8/10 gap , @entity180 v - neck , £ 89.95 blue v - neck , £ 89.95 washing instructions : dry clean weight : 220g colour fastness : 88.6 % resistance to pilling : @entity186 shrinkage after washing : width -4.1 % , length -3.2 % , sleeve length +2.9 % fit : slouchy fit but still nice and snug across the shoulders - liked the middle seam down the centre of the back as an added design detail			0
verdict : this was the heaviest of all the jumpers we weighed - and although that 's partly because it 's a slightly bigger fit than the rest , it does feel more substantial			0
even though the instructions were dry clean only , it did n't do badly on our wash test			1
score : 6/10 @entity11 , @entity209 v - neck , £ 79.99 @entity209 v - neck , £ 79.99 washing instructions : handwash at @entity116 weight : 194g colour fastness : 98.6 % resistance to pilling : 2/5 shrinkage after washing : width 4.6 % , length +0.4 % , sleeve length +1.5 % fit : quite wide in the body but sleeves very narrow ; looser , more tunic - like fit around waist			1
verdict : although this jumper washed well and has a decent weight to it , it was joint worst with @entity227 when it came to pilling and it lost a point for the slightly strange fit			1
score : 6/10 @entity231 , @entity180 v - neck , £ 79 pale blue v - neck , £ 79 washing instructions : wash at @entity116 weight : 178g colour fastness : 91.4 % resistance to pilling : @entity186 shrinkage after washing : width -9.6 % , length -1.35 % , sleeve length -0.4 % fit : very long in the body but otherwise a fairly traditional fit with nice shape across the shoulders and sleeves that are the right length			1
verdict : although this jumper put in an average performance across most of our tests , it lost almost 10 per cent of its width after just one wash , despite the fact that the label advises washing at 30c - that 's a disappointing result for a company like @entity231 that usually prides itself on the quality of its clothes			1
score : 5/10 @entity261 & @entity262 at @entity9 , @entity264 v - neck , £ 40 coral v - neck , £ 40 washing instructions : wash at @entity267 weight : 146g colour fastness : 98.6 % resistance to pilling : @entity186 shrinkage after washing : width -4.5 % , length -2.45 % , sleeve length -0 % fit : feels soft and looks fluffy ; nice ruched shoulder detail but sleeves are bracelet length and body comes up shorter than on others and it bags a bit above the waistband			1
verdict : the lightest of all the jumpers we weighed - and it looks and feels pretty flimsy , too			0
while it held its shape and colour well , it does n't have a lot of longevity			0
the style , price and performance have it pegged as throwaway fashion so do n't expect to be wearing it this time next year			0
layer it with a long - sleeved vest if you actually want to stay warm			0
score : 5/10 @entity227 , @entity301 v - neck , £ 69 dark green v - neck , £ 69 washing instructions : hand wash weight : 158g colour fastness : 91.4 % resistance to pilling : 2/5 shrinkage after washing : width -3.9 % , length -1.05 % , sleeve length +1.2 % fit : does n't feel particularly fitted or form flattering			1
verdict : another very lightweight jumper that might have washed well overall but did particularly badly in the pilling test and did n't do much for us when it came to fit			1
we say spend the extra tenner and get the @entity146 one instead			1
score : 5/10 @entity8 , @entity319 turtleneck , £ 42 black turtle neck , £ 42 washing instructions : dry clean or handwash cold weight : 190g colour fastness : 88.6 % resistance to pilling : @entity186 shrinkage after washing : width -4.55 % , length -7.2 % , sleeve length -6.7 % fit : slightly long in the sleeves but otherwise a good classic fitting roll neck and not as lightweight as you might think			1
verdict : admittedly we did n't follow the washing instructions so maybe we should n't be surprised that it shrank quite dramatically , losing over 4cm in length on the body and around 3cm on the sleeves - but realistically , who 's going to handwash a @entity8 jumper ? the impressive price for the weight gives it an extra point			1
score : 4/10 @entity10 , @entity348 v - neck , £ 69 purple v - neck , £ 69 washing instructions : wash at 40c weight : 176g colour fastness : 84.2 % resistance to pilling : 3/5 shrinkage after washing : width -8.55 % , length -3.3 % , sleeve length -4.9 % fit : narrow rib at waist and cuffs makes it seem more delicate , as does the rolled seam at the neck - slightly shorter in length than others			1
verdict : despite saying it could be washed at 40c , this jumper shrank more than most when washed at 30c , losing 3.5cm off the width			0
and , even though the colour change was only marginal , it also came off worst in the colour fastness test			1
on the plus side it did n't pill as much as others , but a score of three out of five is still lower than the lab would expect from a quality retailer			0

we test @entity74 , @entity146 , @entity11 , @entity231 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity227 and @entity8
