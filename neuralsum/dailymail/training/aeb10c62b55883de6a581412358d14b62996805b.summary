the government ’s advisory committee on vaccination has so far refused to endorse it for routine use , saying it is not cost effective			1
it costs £ 75 a dose and children require four each , costing between £ 400 and £ 500 in total			1
meningitis now , the @entity26 ’s largest meningitis charity , said it welcomed the move , but wants every baby to have it free on the @entity8 , instead of only being available to those who can afford it			1
the @entity26 has one of the highest @entity34 incidence rates in the world - affecting an average of 1,870 people each year - and the disease can kill in hours			0
