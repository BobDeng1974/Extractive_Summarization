@entity0 has warned @entity1 and his promoter @entity2 that they will have to play second fiddle if there is to be another @entity7 at @entity8			2
@entity0 , in @entity9 preparing for saturday 's clash of former world champions with @entity13 @entity12 , will only agree to fight @entity1 ' on my terms			1
' @entity1 , who is recovering from being stabbed in the leg while on holiday , is a potential fall back opponent for @entity0 next year if @entity19 continues to renege on his promise of giving @entity22 's favourite son the mega-fight of his dreams			1
@entity0 is preparing for his fight with @entity12 in @entity9 next week but @entity0 is angered by @entity2 going public with an offer of $ 5million ( Â£ 3.2m ) and will not concede @entity1 the thick end of the purse which usually goes to a defending world champion			1
he says : ' i respect @entity1 for winning his title but the fact is that i would be the main draw if we fight and he will have to accept that			0
' of @entity2 , who staged the biggest fight in modern @entity37 boxing when @entity38 knocked out @entity39 in front of an 80,000 crowd at @entity8 earlier this year , @entity0 says : ' who is he to tell me how much he will give me to fight @entity1 ? ' @entity1 won the world title in the summer but was stabbed in the leg while on holiday @entity1 celebrates with his world title after beating @entity48 in @entity49 @entity1 has long been seeking a showdown with @entity0 , who says : ' that fight could happen but only under the complete control of @entity53 , on my terms and conditions			2
we will choose where and when it takes place and i will decide how much i am paid			0
i dictate my purse for my big fights			0
' it was disrespectful of @entity2 to say what my purse would be			0
i will only fight @entity1 if it makes financial sense , if the public genuinely want it and if a fight for me with @entity19 or @entity71 does n't materialise			2
' @entity0 is hoping to make such an emphatic statement against @entity12 on his first top - of - the - bill appearance at the fabled @entity75 in @entity9 that @entity19 will finally be forced to fight him			1
the @entity77 man , who is widely regarded as the best pound - for - pound boxer in the world. , failed to make good on a promise to fight @entity0 this year			2
@entity0 pulled out of a world welterweight title challenge to @entity12 a year ago on the understanding that he would meet @entity19 in may			1
since then @entity12 has lost the title and saturday 's fight is one neither man can afford to lose			2
@entity0 , who twice lost his own world titles , acknowledges : ' i ca n't afford to make another mistake but although i 'm still young in boxing terms i 'm now older and wiser			0
' the prize of a mega-millions challenge to @entity19 is again tantalisingly close for @entity0 and he says : ' i need to make a statement against @entity12 which mobilises the public in @entity13 to put pressure on him to fight me			1
' @entity0 remains keen to fight @entity19 or @entity71 in 2015 there is a sense in the @entity13 that @entity0 would be the only viable alternative for @entity19 if he continues to prevaricate about meeting @entity97 in what would be the richest fight of all time. , the world has been waiting years for that and @entity0 says : ' it would be great for boxing for those two to fight each other but obviously it would upset my plans			1
i 've been waiting a long time for @entity19			0
' he also suspects that @entity19 is wary , saying : ' a lot of people over here , including my @entity111 promoter @entity110 , are saying that my speed would give @entity19 a lot of problems and that i could be the first boxer to defeat him			0
@entity0 beat @entity115 on points in his last fight back in may ' i want the biggest fights and would also be happy to box @entity71 but to be honest i think @entity19 would be an easier fight for me style wise			1
' then he reassures his army of fans : ' do n't worry			0
i 'm not looking past @entity12			0
i 'm excited about boxing at the @entity124 and there are giant posters all over the @entity127 to remind me of how big this fight is in its own right			0
' @entity0 v @entity12 will be televised live saturday night on @entity130 .			1

@entity0 faces @entity12 in @entity9 on saturday
@entity0 says he dictates how much he should be paid for fights
@entity0 still hopes to fight @entity19 in 2015
