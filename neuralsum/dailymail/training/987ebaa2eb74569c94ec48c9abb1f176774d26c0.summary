risk : agony aunt @entity1 faced a backlash over her latest advice ¿ saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped for four decades she has imparted wisdom to millions of women			1
but agony aunt @entity1 yesterday faced a backlash over her latest advice – saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped			1
miss @entity1 , who has worked as an agony aunt at @entity14 since 1973 , claimed that the onus was on women to protect themselves against attack			1
she said those who ‘ get drunk with the boys ’ become incapable of defending themselves because ‘ drunkenness tears that away			1
it really is carelessness to lose your self - defence ’			1
she called rape ‘ an assault with a weapon ’ , adding : ‘ you really have to be a little bit defensive when you ’re around people who are stupid and armed			1
’ the 78 - year - old ’s pronouncement was seized upon by anti-rape campaigners , who labelled her advice ‘ totally irresponsible ’ and called it ‘ misguided , unhelpful and judgmental ’			1
she made the comments in an interview with @entity36 presenter @entity35 on @entity38 ’s @entity37 yesterday morning			2
miss @entity35 asked @entity39 about views she expressed some years ago , when she said women ’s sexual freedom came with an obligation to protect themselves			2
miss @entity35 quoted miss @entity1 ’s words : ‘ please remember that your new freedom to go out and play with the boys requires you to employ an even greater freedom new to women , the greatest freedom ... the freedom to take responsibility for ourselves			1
’ asked by @entity53 if she meant that rape was the fault of the victim , miss @entity1 said : ‘ rape is a vicious and wicked crime			1
it ’s an assault with a weapon			2
it ’s not the fault of the victim			0
however it ’s a very good idea to keep away , to protect yourself			2
‘ what i ’m saying actually is not that it is her fault			0
but please protect yourself , now that you ’re allowed to , by not getting drunk with the boys			1
’ miss @entity35 retorted that just because women get drunk , it does n’t mean they should become victims of rape , in the same way that men should n’t become rapists if they drink too much			1
miss @entity1 replied : ‘ no , and i could n’t agree more if you ’re saying that nor should men become rapists because they can get drunk			2
it ’s like saying someone ’s got to shoot someone because he ’s got a gun			0
‘ however , the woman is responsible for herself			0
men and women are not quite the same			0
if a woman had a weapon she could use when she got drunk , i would tell her not to , of course			2
strong words : miss @entity90 said those who ' get drunk with the boys ' become incapable of defending themselves ( posed by models ) ‘ but what she does have that she can use is self - defence			1
and drunkenness tears that away			0
it really is carelessness to lose your self - defence			1
you really have to be a little bit defensive when you ’re around people who are stupid and armed			0
’ miss @entity1 ’s comments were last night condemned by anti-rape organisations , who said women often did not fight back during sexual assault in order to survive			1
@entity108 , of women @entity109 , said : ‘ her comments are totally irresponsible			1
it is time commentators stopped blaming victims and put the responsibility on those who do the crime – rapists			0
' it is carelessness to lose your self defence ' ‘ many women do not fight back out of fear or as a survival technique – they can suffer even more injury by physically fighting back			2
’ @entity123 , chief executive of campaign group @entity124 , which acts to reduce violence against women , added : ‘ whoever the rapist , whatever the circumstances , the state of intoxication of the victim is irrelevant			0
rapists are the only ones responsible for rape			0
‘ most – but not all – victims of sexual violence and abuse are stone - cold sober when they are abused			0
those who are drunk or intoxicated through drug use are no more deserving of abuse and no less deserving of support			0
’ born in @entity143 in 1935 , miss @entity1 is the daughter of a dentist			2
she studied at @entity145 , graduating with a degree in @entity148 literature			0
after travelling around @entity149 , she lived in @entity150 for a short time before settling in @entity151			0
she initially worked as a journalist for 1960s magazine @entity154 , before joining @entity14 as agony aunt in 1973			1
a regular on @entity38 , she has written three self - help books , two novels and three travel books			0
