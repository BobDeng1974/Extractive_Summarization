if you 've always liked the idea of a tattoo with your name on it , but never actually wanted to go under the needle , now is your chance to bring your inking dreams to life - by letting someone else do it instead			2
@entity10 , 22 , from @entity11 , is offering her body as a blank canvas for strangers to fill with tattoos of their choice as part of a bizarre art project			1
for donations of around £ 6 , strangers can get their names tattooed on her body , while pledges of £ 60 and above give donors the chance to submit their own design			1
she said : ' this idea has been playing on my mind for a while			2
i want the project to create a piece of priceless art. ' she said she is willing to have almost anything tattooed on her body , although there are certain exceptions			1
she said : ' i would n't want a grape tattooed on me because in time it would wrinkle and become a raisin - no hate speech either			1
' a diagram which shows how many tattoos illma currently has , before she adds those pledged by strangers the diagram on the @entity33 page which shows how artist @entity10 hopes to cover herself with tattoos the artist , who had her first tattoo at age 15 , has more than 40 designs on her body - including six on her face			1
she said she will never look back with regret on getting any of her tattoos			0
' my rule of thumb is never regret something that once made up the person that you are today			0
' there is something absurd and beautiful about having an accumulation of absolute strangers name 's draped over my pale goth skin			0
' for around £ 6 , strangers can have their names tattooed on @entity10 's body , for £ 60 they can submit a design her goal is to get at least 2,500 names tattooed on her - and she 's not far off			1
she said : ' i did n't expect the idea to become so popular on the internet			0
i love reading people 's responses and requests			0
the weirdest request i 've had so far is ' c * * * beard '			0
' i am still waiting for someone to suggest @entity88			0
