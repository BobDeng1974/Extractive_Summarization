a week in the @entity0 , lapping up the sun and the odd glass of champagne , gazing across the yachts bobbing in the marina			2
it sounds idyllic , but perhaps is not the way you might imagine @entity9 prepares to win the masters			1
but @entity9 promises this break , just weeks before the first major of the year , means he will be fit and fresh for his latest assault on @entity14			1
the downtime ensured plenty of opportunity to dream about feeling that green jacket draped over his shoulders , and what meal he would choose for the champion ’s dinner the following year			1
not that he needs to think too hard about that last bit			2
‘ i hate tempting fate , ’ he says while reclining on a lounger in his luxury holiday apartment in @entity27			1
‘ but i know exactly what my jacket measurements are and i know exactly what [ dinner ] i would choose			2
but i ’m not telling you ! ’ @entity9 lines up his putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round of the @entity38 these are certainly not the words of a man who feels he is taking things too easy in the build - up to the most eagerly - anticipated week of the golfing year			1
‘ i ’ve tried every type of formula , ’ he says			2
‘ i ’ve had two weeks off before ; i ’ve played [ tournaments ] during the run - in ; i ’ve tried going to @entity14 several days before masters week to get some extra prep in			1
i ’ve tried everything but nothing ’s worked			2
’ so this year @entity9 , who has two top 10 finish at the masters in his 10 attempts , has simply said to hell with it , let ’s have some fun			1
family comes first , practice comes second			2
sharing his holiday with the world on @entity64 comes third , of course			1
@entity9 celebrates during the fourball match on the second day of the @entity68 golf tournament by now , however , the serious work has begun			1
some of his time in the @entity0 was spent on the range , before the workload was ramped up last week			2
the @entity68 defines @entity9 , gets his juices flowing , his eyes and veins popping like nothing else			1
but he lives for the annual trip down @entity78			2
‘ the electricity , the tension , the buzz ’ of masters week give him goosebumps			0
he admits to a ‘ love affair ’ with the place and its storied history			2
only the @entity86 can compete with the masters for his affections and ambitions			0
but at the age of 39 , and with @entity91 leading a new breed of power hitters ready to clean up the majors , @entity9 knows he will not get too many more chances of claiming either prize			1
@entity9 plays into the 13th green during the final round of the 2014 @entity99 so , if push came to shove , would he take a green jacket over a claret jug ? ‘ that ’s a very unfair question , ’ he says			1
‘ i would n’t take it			0
because i think i ’ll win a claret jug , and i think i ’ll win a green jacket			0
and i ’m quite happy to put my neck on the line			0
’ in a flash , there is the mentality that has vanquished many an @entity113 dream			0
despite @entity9 ’s @entity68 heroics , he has still never won a strokeplay event on @entity113 soil			1
he came close to victory in the @entity118 last month but a final - round collapse featuring five balls in the water extended that duck			1
yet the lion - hearted @entity123 believes he will still claim the game ’s two biggest prizes			2
@entity9 admits the prospect of retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled			1
but he has already written his rags - to - riches story , from assistant club professional in @entity131 to super-rich superstar in @entity133			2
he knows he will be able to reflect one day on an extraordinary career			0
@entity135 golfer @entity9 admits retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled ‘ yeah i ’d feel incomplete [ without a major ] but i ’d feel very content living the rest of my life knowing that i gave it a good go			1
it would n’t stop me sleeping at night , i can certainly say that much			0
i want to win , i ’m passionate about winning , that ’s what keeps me going			0
but if it does n’t happen , it does n’t happen			0
i ’m working very hard and if guys beat me fair and square then that ’s fine			0
’ two top - 10 finishes at @entity14 in the last five years suggests there will not be too many who can be confident of beating @entity9 next week			1
he admits , however , that the ‘ truly remarkable ’ @entity91 could be one of them			2
going for the career grand slam at the age of 25 is simply ‘ incredible ’ , but even if this is not the week that feat is achieved , @entity9 insists the @entity156 is already the equal of @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
@entity9 smiles during practice ahead of the @entity163 on the @entity165 course at @entity166 ‘ we knew years ago when he burst on to the scene this kid was going to be good , ’ he says			1
‘ we did n’t know how good			0
it happens every decade or couple of decades that someone comes along , gets inspired , works incredibly hard , is very dedicated , and proves that anything is possible			0
‘ @entity91 is one of those kids who has the natural talent , work ethic and is impressive to watch			0
when he ’s on form he ’s as good as anybody has ever been			0
’ but for all the effusive praise , @entity9 rates @entity181 as the man to beat this year , not @entity91			1
@entity91 hits his tee shot on the third hole during the first round of the @entity38 the defending champion will be chasing his third masters win in four years and @entity9 reckons the huge - hitting left - hander ’s game is so well suited to @entity14 , even the world no 1 might not be able to match him			1
six left - handed winners in the last 12 years — @entity192 , @entity193 ( three times ) and @entity181 ( twice ) — is clearly playing on @entity9 ’s mind			1
he would not be alone among the players in wondering how they can compete on what @entity9 admits is a ‘ bomber ’s course ’			1
still , is @entity181 really the man to beat , rather than @entity91 ? ‘ for sure			0
he hits it long , he hits a nice cut off every tee			0
when you hit it 340 yards with a slight cut , i ’d like to play that golf course			0
yeah , i think he ’s the favourite			0
’ so how can @entity9 compete with @entity181 , @entity91 and the other monster hitters ? ‘ that course lends itself to a cut , or if you ’re a right - hander a draw			1
we all know that before we get there			0
it ’s a case of practising certain shots			0
there are some key holes round there which a draw will favour , or a cut of you ’re a left - hander			2
we all know it , we just have to work on it			0
‘ i have to stick to my game plan			0
i ca n’t hit it 340 , i ’ll try to get it out there at 300 and provided my short game and wedge game is very , very good and my putting is good then i ’ll definitely have a chance come sunday			0
’ if that plan comes to fruition , there ’s a fair chance @entity9 might spend more than just one week living it up in the @entity0			1
he ’d richly deserve it , too			0
and he would n’t even have to spend time worrying about what he ’d choose for the champions dinner in 2016			0
