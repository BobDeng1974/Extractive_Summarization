by @entity0 , political reporter an mp who was suspended from the @entity2 over claims he sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent publicly apologised to her yesterday			1
@entity5 admitted he had ‘ crossed the line ’ and had an ‘ inappropriate and unprofessional ’ relationship with the woman after she asked him for help with noisy neighbours			1
but in an extraordinary development last night , it emerged he will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog – meaning he could cling on as an independent mp until next year ’s election			2
@entity17 mp , @entity5 leaves his home in @entity19 , @entity16 admitted that his relationship with a vulnerable constituent had ' crossed a line ' the 68 - year - old , who represents @entity17 , had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother , known only as ‘ @entity26 ’ or ‘ ah ’ , during her four - year fight to obtain an apology			1
but yesterday as part of a @entity32 settlement he apologised unreservedly for any distress			1
the case is a major embarrassment for @entity36 , who was accused of turning a blind eye to the claims , and follows a string of sex scandals to engulf the @entity2			1
in a statement read at the @entity32 yesterday , mr @entity5 said : ‘ in october 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your mp and councillor			1
the former @entity2 faces an internal party investigation into his behaviour subsequently and over several months i came to your home on several occasions , sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional			1
‘ i understand that you felt degraded			2
i did not treat you with sufficient respect			2
i made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and i crossed the line			1
as a political representative , there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which i was aware			2
‘ you had a right to trust me			2
everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and i am sorry i made you feel otherwise			1
i have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again			0
’ he added : ‘ i also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim			2
these statements sought to discredit and undermine you			0
‘ this should never have happened			0
i accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong			0
’ the 39 - year - old woman had attempted to complain about mr @entity5 ’s behaviour through the police , the office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards , as well as the @entity2 and @entity80 , but her solicitor yesterday said she had been ‘ blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage ’			1
the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , said she had contemplated suicide over the ‘ disgusting ’ way she had been treated by the @entity2			1
yesterday she said : ‘ i am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me			0
since the incidents about which i complained happened back in 2010 , my physical and mental health have suffered and i am grateful that i may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son			0
’ the woman first met mr @entity5 in october 2009 at his constituency office in @entity104 , after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours			1
a year later , he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances			0
he was never charged after police found there was no case to answer			0
in 2011 , a @entity113 woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four - year affair with @entity5 while she worked as his researcher			1
@entity117 ( right ) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the mp as part of a ‘ honeytrap ’ operation			2
during her time working with @entity5 , she even moved into his @entity127 flat			1
earlier that year , @entity5 admitted having a ‘ close and affectionate relationship ’ with a 17 - year - old girl			1
the pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience			0
‘ it was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual , ’ he said			0
‘ there was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that			0
’ in 2010 it was claimed that @entity5 had helped another @entity113 woman , 25 - year - old @entity141 , to stay in @entity142 after she ran into visa problems in the @entity144			1
miss @entity141 ’s ex-husband said the mp went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office			0
@entity5 was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the @entity151 and @entity144			1
the marriage of @entity153 ( right ) , a @entity2 councillor and a mother of three , broke up as a result of their relationship			1
‘ i had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party , ’ she said			0
@entity5 was also said to have had a six - year affair with @entity165 , his constituency secretary			1
she told a newspaper : ‘ he ’s no great looker , he ’s not @entity169 ’s gift to women , but he charms his way in			0
’ there have also been allegations that @entity5 had a relationship with @entity174 , 20 , whom he met during an aid trip to a village near @entity177 in october 1990			2
she claimed : ‘ we were very close			0
i miss him very much			0
he ’s a kind and charming man			0
he came on many trips , first in october 1990 , then @entity182 that year , then in january , march and april or may			0
i saw him each time			0
’ in march 2011 , the woman complained about mr @entity5 to senior @entity2 officials at the party ’s @entity186 headquarters , but no action was taken against him			1
in a letter to mr @entity36 ’s office in february last year , she said mr @entity5 had exposed himself to her , made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her , but he was still not disciplined			1
last night she told the @entity192 : ‘ @entity36 has been negligent			0
he should have acted sooner and taken notice of a woman in my position			2
’ the parliamentary commissioner for standards can examine financial wrongdoing but can not investigate claims an mp has abused their position in other ways			0
it means mr @entity5 could keep his seat until the next election			2
@entity80 did ask @entity205 to investigate the allegations			0
but his report was never published and the @entity2 - controlled council voted to keep it under wraps			2
in his conclusions , mr @entity216 wrote : ‘ making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of @entity220 , i have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by mr @entity5			2
’ mr @entity5 was suspended from the @entity2 in january after the case became public			1
the party yesterday said a disciplinary investigation will now be re-started .			0
