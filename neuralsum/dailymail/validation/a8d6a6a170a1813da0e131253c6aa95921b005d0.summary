the pain for the @entity1 must be considerable			1
in the early days of his son @entity3 's courtship of @entity4 , the waspish @entity5 would jokily refer to the @entity7 as ' meet the @entity8 ' , a reference to the @entity11 comedy about unconventional in - laws			1
how completely that joke has now been vaporised by @entity14 and @entity15			0
as they play a major role in the upbringing of the soon - to - be 20 - month - old future @entity19 , @entity1 complains that he ' almost never ' sees his grandson			1
the @entity24 's @entity23 diary revealed this week that @entity1 is becoming increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he plays in the young @entity1 's life			1
well , the situation could get even trickier			0
for there is a ' definite feeling ' among friends of the @entity5 — @entity19 's step - grandmother — that @entity4 's parents could be thinking of buying a place in @entity44 , where @entity3 and @entity4 will soon be living virtually full - time at @entity45 , near the @entity47 's @entity46			1
@entity4 's new baby is due to arrive next month , and @entity3 will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with @entity51 in the summer			1
the @entity52 have often stayed with their daughter and son - in - law at ten - bedroom @entity45 — they spent @entity55 there , fracturing the tradition of the normal royal get - together at @entity46 when @entity3 and @entity4 were absent from the @entity47 's lunch			1
but @entity14 , a miner 's granddaughter raised in a council house , and founder and driving force of the family online shop @entity66 , is a formidable , self - made woman of independence			0
getting a place of their own nearby would , of course , mean she could see lots more of @entity4 and her children without people thinking she was installing herself at @entity74			1
she is , after all , the only mother , and grandmother for @entity19 , that @entity4 and @entity3 have			1
for prince @entity1 , though , the dismay of seeing much less than he expected of his first grandson is heightened by his dreams of ' mentoring ' the future king			1
in - law rivalry : friends of prince @entity1 claim he is frustrated by the amount of time @entity19 spends with his @entity15 relatives ith whom he recently holidayed in @entity35 for @entity14 's ( pictured left ) 60th birthday just a few days before @entity19 was born , @entity1 was jovially asking a ladies ' circle in @entity89 for ' any hints ' on being a grandfather			1
' spoil them and enjoy them — but give them back at the end of the day , ' he was told , amid much laughter			0
on that day it was obvious to the ladies that here was a man anxious to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never had for very long himself			0
@entity1 was only three when @entity102 died , and he never knew his paternal grandfather , prince @entity104 's dissolute , playboy father prince @entity103 , who died in 1944			1
the @entity105 stepped into her husband 's empty space and became @entity1 's counsellor and mentor , a vital sounding board in his life , until her death in 2002 at the age of 101			1
it is not difficult to see how all of this kindled a desire to closely oversee the development of baby @entity19 , a need that is now apparently unfulfilled , despite the fact that the @entity1 has a special connection with his grandson , which , he believes , brings them even closer			1
the truth is that he feels an empathy with his grandson because he knows that , like himself , the little chap is going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he can fulfil his destiny			0
it is a unique and extraordinary situation that three generations of heir to the throne , aged 66 , 32 and 20 months , are all living at the same time			0
for his part , prince @entity1 has always recognised that the pull on @entity4 by her mother would be strong			2
as an aide puts it : ' of course , he acknowledges that the mother - daughter thing is natural , and he 's aware it 's likely to be just the same when the new baby arrives			0
' @entity142 : prince @entity3 and @entity143 , the @entity144 and @entity4 with their son @entity30 one has to wonder , however , how different things would have been if princess @entity147 were still alive to balance @entity14 's pull on her daughter			2
@entity150 is little help in this respect and she has no special bond with @entity4 or , for that matter , much of one with @entity3			2
but is @entity155 really the only issue here ? friends of hers say it 's unfair to put the blame on her for @entity1 seeing so little of his grandson			2
the fact is , @entity4 has rushed home to her mother at every opportunity — not just when she was suffering from morning sickness — and she and @entity3 have been endlessly taking @entity19 at weekends to spend time with @entity14 , 60 , and husband @entity15 , 65 , at their £ 5 million manor house in @entity170			1
yet they have rarely , if ever , been seen at @entity172 in @entity173			2
' all @entity14 has ever wanted was to give as much guidance and help to @entity4 and @entity19 as any other grandmother , ' says a family friend			1
' she 'll be horrified to learn that @entity3 's father is apparently upset because he is not seeing enough of @entity19			1
she would never want that			0
' when @entity4 was first pregnant , @entity14 would have been all too aware of the demands that were bound to be made on the baby prince by the palace and , it 's clear , she fully accepted it			0
but she would also have known that @entity3 would defend the @entity52 ' right to be involved — he 'd repeatedly insisted this should be the case			2
@entity3 's role was always going to be crucial because , until now , in - laws have traditionally found themselves frozen out in the @entity189			2
after princess @entity190 married captain @entity191 and gave birth to @entity193 and then @entity194 , her mother - in - law , @entity190 , complained she and her husband had been ' completely forgotten by @entity196 '			0
what even @entity155 did n't anticipate , though , was that @entity3 would not only make sure she had a ' say ' in the early years of her first grandchild , but he would , indeed , be the driving force behind @entity30 spending many days under the informal , unroyal influence of his self - made , middle - class in - laws — people whose outlook is so different from the stiffly royal approach of his father			2
of course , this was more in line with an experience and understanding of life outside palace walls to which his mother @entity147 had pointedly introduced him and his brother @entity213 at an early age			0
@entity215 : a pregnant @entity5 looks well as she steps out this week for lunch at the @entity217			0
prince @entity1 will be keen to see his second grandchild as well as more of @entity30 so , how often does @entity1 see his grandson ? the answer is not very often at all			2
our understanding is that he would love to see more of @entity19 , but does not want to have to ask			2
this shines an interesting light on the relationship between father and son			0
there are very real tensions between the two of them , and @entity1 often disagrees with @entity3			1
but if there is an argument , friends say , @entity1 backs down every time			1
' it 's very different when @entity3 has an argument with @entity4 , ' reports a figure from their own circle			2
' she 's eloquent and stands her ground			0
it 's been a sharp learning curve for @entity3 , especially through the rougher passages of @entity4 's two pregnancies			2
' handling his father , it seems , is so much easier			0
' part of @entity3 is a rebel who just does n't want to be another version of his father , or have a stuffy , traditional royal role , ' says a family friend			1
' it 's one of the reasons why he 's taken the @entity51 job			0
' i 'm convinced he wants to show @entity1 that he can be not only a royal , but also a ' @entity15 '			0
his message is that he 's part of their family — a family that gave him a proper home life			0
' could it be this that lies behind prince @entity1 's complaint that he does n't see enough of his infant grandson ? @entity1 is understandably happy that @entity3 has found a loving wife and a new family			1
but he must surely resent any suggestion that the @entity272 give @entity3 what he himself has n't been able to			1
after all , how could he , in the aftermath of @entity147 's death ? meanwhile , @entity4 and @entity3 have settled into @entity74 and are doing things their own way — which might not suit some traditionalists			0
just the other day , it emerged that @entity4 's housekeeper at @entity74 , @entity281 , had handed in her notice , together with her husband , @entity283 , who worked as the gardener			0
both were previously employed by the @entity47 at @entity46 and had agreed to switch to @entity74 to work for the @entity144 and @entity4			0
now , they are believed to be going back to what the locals refer to as ' the big house '			0
no reason has been given for their departure from @entity74 , which @entity155 has been visiting on a very regular basis — even though it is a three - hour - plus journey from her @entity170 home			0
@entity14 's regular presence there only serves to highlight @entity1 's absence — and the growing sadness he is said to feel at the lack of regular contact with his grandson , as well as @entity3 's apparent loosening of his royal roots			1
whether or not this 21st - century , middle - class nurturing will ultimately turn out to be the correct preparation for a future king is impossible to say			0
with @entity3 and @entity4 living in @entity44 , her parents thinking of buying a place down the road and @entity1 spending most of his time 170 miles away at @entity172 , it appears unlikely that the @entity1 will see very much more of his grandson — not to mention the new arrival next month — than he has been .			1

@entity1 said to be frustrated at time @entity19 spends with @entity272
@entity1 will be 170 miles away in @entity172 when @entity3 starts new job
middleton family *rumoured* to be buying place in @entity44 to be nearby
