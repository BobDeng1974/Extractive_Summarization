@entity0 , 17 , was saved by two off - duty police officers when she had a heart attack in @entity3 , @entity4 a teenager battling bulimia who ' died ' on the street from a heart attack was saved by a pair of off - duty police officers who gave her cpr			1
@entity0 , 17 , was out with her boyfriend in @entity3 's @entity14 , @entity4 , when she suddenly collapsed			1
doctors believe her potassium levels had plummeted to such a low level that her heart completely stopped			1
but luckily , two officers , believed to be from the @entity20 , rushed to her side and gave @entity0 life - saving cpr until an ambulance arrived			1
she was then rushed to @entity3 hospital , where she was put into an induced coma			1
but the teenager then made an unexpected recovery which stunned medics			0
she is now recovering at her home in @entity30 , @entity4 , despite her mother @entity31 being told to expect the worst			1
the family are now trying to find the police officers who saved @entity0 so they can thank them in person			1
@entity0 said : ' i do n't remember much about what happened that day but i owe the doctors and the off - duty officers everything			1
' i feel very tired still and i know i have a long recovery ahead			0
it 's been really horrible but i am so thankful to be alive			2
' ms @entity31 added : ' i would love to be able to meet the police officers who saved my daughter 's life and for them to get in touch ' i really want to thank the two off duty police officers that saved my daughter 's life			1
they are just absolute heroes			0
' and also the critical care team at @entity53 - the treatment she received there was brilliant			2
' the drama unfolded while @entity0 was waiting outside the @entity58 's restaurant while her boyfriend @entity59 went to park his car			1
when he came back , he found @entity0 laying on the floor with a crowd gathered around her			1
ms @entity31 then received a phone call , telling her what had happened			2
the 17 - year - old , who suffers with bulimia , had collapsed because she had a dangerous level of potassium in her body			2
she is now recovering at home with her mother @entity31 ( right ) humans need potassium in higher amounts than any other mineral			1
adults need around 3,500mg in their body per day			0
@entity77 plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acid / alkaline balance of the body			0
it is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly			2
it also counterbalances sodium in the body , and is known to help lower blood pressure			0
to get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables , which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium			0
the @entity99 ( @entity100 1990 ) showed that the average intake of potassium is 3,187mg in males and 2,434mg in females			0
compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low			0
people most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly , athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs			0
heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake			0
she said : ' fortunately a young bouncer working at the park had the presence of mind to take her phone and ring me			0
' he said to me " your daughter has collapsed and is receiving cpr "			0
i asked if she was responding and he just went quiet and said " no "			0
the drive from @entity30 to @entity3 was awful			2
' @entity0 was transferred to @entity53 where doctors told ms @entity31 that her heart had stopped			1
she had technically died for a short time , they said			0
the teen was then put into an induced coma			1
doctors told ms @entity31 to return in the morning but to prepare for the worst			1
she said : ' i went home to @entity0 's bedroom and was just clutching the coat she had been wearing			1
i was crying and crying			0
' but , the next morning , doctors began to bring @entity0 out of the coma and she started to breathe on her own			1
five days later she was allowed home			0
ms @entity31 said : ' i really want to warn other young people about the effects of bulimia			2
' i know it is an illness but it is beyond my comprehension why these kids do this			0
it is not a game			0
it can have life - threatening consequences			2
' @entity0 suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome ( @entity162 ) , which her mother believes caused her to become depressed and develop bulimia			1
doctors believe that @entity0 had been so sick that her potassium levels had dropped to a dangerous level .			2
