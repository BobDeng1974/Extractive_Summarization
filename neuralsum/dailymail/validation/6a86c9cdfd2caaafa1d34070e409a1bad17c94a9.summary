the chance to test their mettle against the best is what attracts players and managers to the @entity6			1
but for one young coach who has already reached the promised land , it was the second tier of @entity11 football that provided his steepest learning curve			0
' the championship is really , really difficult ! ' @entity14 manager @entity13 tells @entity16			1
' coaches who do n't have that experience can not realise how difficult it is			0
' the standard of the players is more or less the same			0
it makes it very competitive right through the season			2
you can see in the way teams ' positions change throughout the season , from the bottom and the top of the league			0
and the dreamland – the @entity34 – is so , so close ! @entity13 gestures during a press conference at the @entity37 stadium ahead of facing @entity38 @entity14 's @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , head coach @entity13 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 train ahead of their @entity6 clash at @entity38 ' i learnt a lot in that league			1
there were some points where i was not prepared enough , but you gain experience by doing , not just watching or listening			0
' it 's like jumping into a swimming pool at the deep end			2
you can see how to do it from the side , but you will never learn unless you jump in			0
' and jump in is precisely what @entity13 did seven years ago when he left the safety of the @entity64 junior set - up to become the face of @entity66 and @entity68 's project at @entity69			1
taking the reins under a couple of @entity73 moguls with a four - year plan to reach the top flight might seem like a daunting prospect for a debutant manager , but not for @entity13			1
' nothing is too soon			0
i will always be thankful to @entity66			0
all the difficulties i got through at that club and all the demands he made of me gave me the opportunity to grow			0
it was so demanding on a daily basis – 24 hours every day from the first day i arrived there			0
' but what of @entity66 's notorious habit of involving himself in managerial decisions ? ' he tried			2
but i always fight for my convictions			0
' @entity14 manager @entity13 says the @entity93 is a highly competitive league @entity13 's first job in club management was with @entity69 between 2008 and 2009 it is widely believed that these convictions - a refusal to act merely as @entity66 's touchline proxy - are what saw @entity13 ejected from the @entity102 hotseat after just 26 games in charge			1
the two - time @entity6 winner would get a second chance at @entity93 success just two months later though , taking over from @entity108 at @entity109 in june 2009			1
under chairman @entity110 , @entity13 was given time to get his ideas across , and a subsequent seventh - placed finish – the club 's highest for 27 years – showed it was time well spent			1
but the manager 's progress had n't gone unnoticed , and when moneybags @entity118 came calling , @entity13 could n't resist			1
it quickly transpired that swapping the @entity121 for the @entity122 was a mistake – @entity13 was sacked after less than three months in charge – and the former @entity64 international readily admits to a lapse of judgment in that summer of 2010			1
the @entity129 coach also had a spell in charge of @entity132 side @entity109 between 2009 and 2010 as a player , @entity13 won the @entity6 with @entity134 and @entity135 ( pictured ) during his playing career , @entity13 also spent time with @entity138 giants @entity137 between 2000 and 2001 ' when i left @entity109 , my ambition pushed me to take decisions in the direction of better infrastructures , better club history and higher prospects to reach the @entity34			1
' instead of seeing the whole forest , i saw only the beautiful tree in front of me			0
@entity109 has lots of beautiful trees , but at that moment i did n't recognise that			2
' that season , with @entity153 , @entity109 were promoted to the @entity34 under the guidance of @entity156			2
@entity13 insists it was not difficult to see his former club achieve what he narrowly missed out on the previous year			1
instead he looked back fondly on his time there , though not everyone at the club regards the @entity13 era with such nostalgia			2
then captain and now manager @entity166 has since released an outspoken autobiography in which he claimed @entity13 's spell at the club had been a ' wasted season ' and he was ' glad we did n't get into the play - offs as he did not deserve to be the one to take us to the @entity34 '			1
these comments resonated with @entity13 : ' look , he 's a person i want to succeed , like everyone			1
but unfortunately he said things about me and i do n't appreciate people talking about somebody when they do n't have the courage to say it up front			0
' he is well integrated in the club , but the key for success at @entity109 is the leadership of @entity110 and the support of the board members , not one manager			1
' current @entity109 manager @entity166 played under @entity13 and is very critical of his former boss the 44 - year - old has managed to lead @entity191 through the group stages of this year 's @entity6 indeed , if @entity13 did not deserve promotion with @entity109 , few could argue that five years later , after negotiating a group containing @entity195 and @entity156 ' s @entity197 side , he has n't earned the right to fight for a place in the quarter - finals of the @entity6			1
going toe - to - toe with @entity156 – whom he describes as ' a top coach and a top person ' – was a satisfying narrative			0
but for @entity13 , now 44 , travelling to @entity205 knowing the winner would reach the last 16 was all the motivation he needed			1
' i love the challenge			0
to play against the best gives us the possibility to become better			0
' @entity197 are an important club who invest lots of money on players , but they were beaten by @entity14			2
@entity14 did n't just defend and look for an opportunity to counter , @entity14 wanted to be the protagonist			2
@entity14 deserved to go through			2
' on tuesday , all that stands in between @entity14 and a first @entity6 quarter - final since the playing days of @entity220 is a formidable @entity38 side			1
after a 1 - 1 draw in the home leg two weeks ago , @entity13 admits it 's a tall order			1
@entity13 has described @entity197 manager @entity156 ( left ) as a ' top coach and top person ' ' i always think we have a chance to win , but we recognise their superior quality			1
they did n't lose one game in the group stage , and they 've only lost three all season			0
' we compete with what we have and my players are proud of what they 've done			0
they are ambitious and courageous , and this gives us the possibility to achieve magical nights			0
' and should the @entity244 do @entity37 bare witness to another of @entity14 's magical nights , who does @entity13 have his eye on in the last eight ? @entity252 's @entity251 , perhaps ? ' it would be amazing for our club			1
he is one of the best coaches in the world			0
some people love him , some people do n't love him – but his record will always be there			0
' i 'm really proud of all the @entity129 coaches abroad			0
their success feels like my success because i know how difficult it is to do well in a foreign country ! ' he certainly does , and with @entity14 seven points clear at the top of the @entity273 and rubbing shoulders with @entity276 's elite , he looks to have well and truly overcome those difficulties			2
but is it only a matter of time until , once again , the ambitious @entity13 tries his luck across the @entity282 ? ‘ my near future is all about what i am doing now in this club			2
i 'm not predicting i 'll be in @entity11 one day , but i know i could make the @entity34 some day in the future			0
