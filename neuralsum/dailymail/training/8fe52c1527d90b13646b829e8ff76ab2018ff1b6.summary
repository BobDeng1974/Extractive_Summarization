exploitation : insurance fraudster @entity1 a crackdown on whiplash fraud has led to a 10 per cent fall in the number of motor insurance injury claims , figures reveal today			1
this has seen the cost of motoring personal injury claims by controversial companies cashing in on them plummet by 33 per cent from £ 354million to £ 238million , a report by industry watchdogs says			1
the £ 116million reduction – the first in a decade – follows legal changes last year and a cull of claims management companies , whose numbers have fallen by 35 per cent to 1,214			1
‘ there appears to be a correlation between these drops , ’ the @entity20 says			0
as a result , it adds , the cost of average third - party motor insurance premiums has fallen by nearly a fifth			1
the report says : ‘ the number of claims management companies has now halved from its peak of more than 2,500 in 2011 and stands at levels last seen at the end of 2007			1
’ the crackdown last year came after mps on the all - party transport select committee condemned the motor insurance claims system as ‘ dysfunctional ’ , making @entity38 ‘ the whiplash capital of @entity40 ’ because of widespread fraud			1
the targets of the crackdown included ‘ crash - for - cash ’ gangs such as the one run by @entity45 , 31 , who devised at least 39 collisions across @entity47 to claim up to £ 500,000 from insurance companies			1
working with actors and the fraudulent company @entity50 , @entity45 filed dozens of claims for injuries such as whiplash			2
on one occasion , he and his employee @entity1 , 25 , filled a single - decker bus with co-conspirators , before driver @entity59 – who was in on the plot – deliberately crashed into a @entity61			0
afterwards , 25 people made claims for whiplash			1
in january , @entity45 and @entity1 were jailed for four - and - a - half and three - and - a - half years respectively for conspiring to defraud insurance companies			0
@entity59 , 26 , was jailed for 20 months			0
the @entity66 has long expressed concern about ‘ discrepancies ’ showing that while the number of damage claims was falling , those for personal injury were soaring			0
but @entity73 , one of the authors of the new report , said : ‘ legal changes in 2013 appear to have had a significant impact on motor insurance injury claims			2
’ pain : whiplash claims dropped last year from £ 354m to £ 238m , said the report by watchdogs ( posed by model ) the biggest changes were those imposed under the legal aid , @entity87 and @entity86 , which slashed the fees that could be earned by ‘ no - win , no - fee ’ legal firms			1
the government announced last october that whiplash cheats would be targeted by independent medical panels considering evidence only from accredited doctors so that ‘ people can no longer profit from exaggerated or fraudulent compensation claims ’			2
justice secretary @entity98 said this would help ‘ turn the tide on the compensation culture ’			0
@entity103 fees paid by lawyers , insurers and claims firms have also been outlawed			0
claims firms have been banned from rewarding individuals who bring them business , and the maximum that lawyers can charge for handling uncontested minor injury claims has been slashed from £ 1,200 to £ 500 , removing a key incentive to settle without asking too many questions			2
mr @entity73 said : ‘ the motor insurance industry anticipated the impact of legal changes and has already passed on the reduction in costs to consumers			0
’ @entity121 , director of @entity122 , said that while the reforms had put ‘ downward pressure ’ on premiums , ‘ too many people are tempted to make a claim knowing that whiplash injury is extremely difficult to disprove ’			0
he added : ‘ government intervention to further toughen up the legal processes could help prevent the otherwise inevitable			0

claims dropped from £ 354m to £ 238m last year , the first fall in a decade
report says third - party premiums have dropped by a fifth as a result
