new research suggests that aspirin may not have any heart - health benefits for older people who long believed a small daily dose of the drug might prevent heart attacks and stokes			0
using a pool of more than 14,000 @entity12 people ages 60 to 85 , researches saw no major differences in heart - related deaths and strokes between those regularly taking aspirin and those who did n't bother			1
however , the study 's authors caution people to talk to their doctors before leaving their pills behind			1
new research suggests that aspirin may not have any heart - health benefits for older people who long believed a small daily dose of the drug might prevent heart attacks and stokes ' patients need to discuss this with their doctor , because i think it 's difficult to do that calculation of benefit and risk without consulting a health care professional , ' said dr. @entity38 , a @entity39 professor who co-authored commentary on the study , tells @entity42			2
he suspects that due to the differences between @entity12 and @entity46 populations , there is little chance the study will have lasting impacts on aspirin use in the @entity46 the study was performed by doctors randomly prescribing low - doses of aspirin to older patients who suffered from high blood pressure , high cholesterol , or diabetes and tracking those who experienced health problems compared to people not taking the drug			1
the patients were tracked on an average of 5 years			2
the study 's co-author , dr. @entity63 , of the @entity65 in @entity12 , presented the findings monday in @entity67 at the @entity69 's annual meeting			1
doctors suspect that due to the differences between @entity12 and @entity46 populations , there is little chance the study will have lasting impacts on aspirin use in the @entity46 ' it indicates that primary prevention with daily low - dose aspirin does not reduce the combined risk in this population , ' he tells @entity42			1
during his presentation he added that : ' the possibility that aspirin does have a beneficial effect can not be excluded , ' as the trial ended earlier than anticipated due to the low number of heart attacks or strokes			0
people who avoided aspirin were more likely to experience ' mini-strokes ' and chest pains but people using aspiring were more likely to have dangerous bleeding			0
those that have a high risk of heart problems could still benefit			0
' for all those people , they should take aspirin for the long haul , because the benefits outweigh the risk , ' @entity38 said			0
' but if you 're very low risk , the benefits of aspirin likely do n't outweigh the risk			0
