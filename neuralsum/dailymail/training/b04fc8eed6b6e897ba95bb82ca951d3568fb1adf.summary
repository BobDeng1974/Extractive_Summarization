@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has warned @entity3 counterpart @entity2 it will be a ' hard road back ' after the latter lost his place in the team			1
@entity9 boss @entity8 said the @entity11 international was set for an indefinite period on the sidelines after leaving him out against @entity14 on sunday			1
growing criticism of @entity2 's inability to command his area and poor distribution - which some blamed for @entity3 's jittery defence - eventually took its toll and he has been replaced by @entity21			1
@entity2 has lost his place in the @entity3 side following a number of high - profile mistakes the @entity27 goalkeeper has not featured in @entity3 's last two matches with @entity21 being preferred @entity1 keeper @entity0 says it is a hard road back to the starting xi for @entity2 @entity0 , no stranger to criticism himself , has some sympathy with his fellow keeper but has warned it may be difficult to come back from the blow			1
' i know he is a @entity38 but i feel for @entity2			1
it is hard being a goalkeeper , ' said the @entity41 , speaking at the launch of his autobiography ' the keeper : a life of @entity47 '			2
' the phrase is taking the goalkeeper out of the spotlight but actually it sheds more light on them			2
' it is not easy			2
it is a confidence position and when you take him out of the team and then bring him back do the team and fans have confidence in him ? ' ' you have to appreciate with a goalkeeper there are going to be ups and downs especially in this league because it is so fast and rough			2
@entity2 ( left ) takes his place on the substitutes bench during @entity3 's 3 - 0 defeat by @entity14 the 26 - year - old warms up before sunday 's defeat at @entity73 ' to be honest i think it is hard road back when you get taken out of the team			1
' sometimes there is no way back			0
it is unfortunate for a goalkeeper but that is the way it is : you can not come on and play the last 20 - 30 minutes and put a good shift in			0
' it is all or nothing with goalkeeping			2
' the @entity41 international has faced criticism almost every season from some disgruntled @entity1 fans and , although some of it becomes personal via social media , @entity0 shrugs it off			1
' social media is , for me , non-existent			0
anyone who pays attention to that - criticism or praise - is pretty silly , ' he added			0
@entity0 was getting into the @entity103 spirit as he donned a reindeer jumper last month ' i think you have to have enough positive experiences to be able to block out the criticism			1
' when i was young and at @entity14 i did not have a lot in my locker to fall back on so you make a mistake and it is doom and gloom and ' you should hang him up '			0
' now i 've had enough criticism and positive experiences to know that i 'm not a bad goalkeeper			0
' i 've had it before and it will happen again - with goalkeepers the next mistake is only just around the corner			0
' if you worry about that you will crumble			0
i think a good goalkeeper always has to have a manager who believes in him			0
