by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 17:01 est , 5 october 2012 a terminally ill 28 - year - old woman has been granted the right to die by a judge after a dramatic legal battle with her parents			1
@entity6 , a bank manager from @entity7 who has terminal brain cancer , had told her parents and the doctors : ‘ i want to die			1
’ but because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a @entity12 in @entity13 , they believe that allowing her daughter to choose death over life is a sin			1
a judge at the state appeals court today sided with miss @entity6 after the rift with her parents led to an agonising legal battle for the family			1
doctors are set to be given the go - ahead to turn off her life support , unless her parents launch further legal action			2
bitter battle : @entity6 , centre , is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour , but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes devastated : miss @entity6 's parents are pictured at the hospital after hearing the news that she has won the right to die happier times : @entity6 , centre , pictured with her parents @entity40 , left , and @entity41 , right ; her father is a pastor at a @entity43 , @entity13 church speaking with the @entity47 , ms @entity6 ’s mother , @entity41 , said : ‘ despite all this confusion , ( my daughter ) wants to go to heaven			1
i keep telling her she can get better			0
’ her daughter is currently at @entity52 @entity51 , hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive			1
she is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem			2
ms @entity6 ’s father is @entity58 reverend @entity40 , and practices out of his church in the @entity43 neighbourhood of @entity13			1
his congregation has flocked behind him to pray for ms @entity6 and tell her of @entity64 's plans for her life			1
the sin of suicide , they said , would condemn their daughter 's soul to hell			2
the difference in beliefs has led to an emergency end - of - life hearing at the hospital , with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances			2
smiling : ms @entity6 had worked as a manager at @entity80 and lived in @entity81 meeting : on october 1 , there was a press conference at @entity51 to inform the media of @entity6 's condition speaking on behalf of ms @entity6 , dr @entity86 testified that the patient ‘ consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed			1
’ however , @entity90 and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated , and is not lucid enough to make the life - or - death decision			0
end - of - life issues are ones that are at once vastly personal and highly polarised			0
according to the @entity98 , the important thing is to do what the person said they wanted , rather than what the person forced to make a decision			0
in cases where the patient can not speak for themselves and there are no specific end - of - life wishes , the @entity98 suggests : ‘ you can make a decision if you can determine what the person probably would have chosen , ’ known as a ‘ substituted judgment			0
’ doctors said that her medications , including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication , are not strong enough to cloud her judgment			0
ms @entity6 ’s troubles began last year			1
before her illness , she worked as a manager for @entity80 , living and working in @entity81			0
she was also training for the famous @entity7 marathon			0
she had emigrated with her parents from @entity125 , @entity126 , the @entity47 reported			2
but ms @entity6 was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem			1
though she received chemotherapy and radiation , the treatments did not successfully target the tumour , and last month , she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed			2
ms @entity6 had apparently talked to nurses at @entity51 about removing the tubes , but her parents interceded			1
offering support : members of the congregation in ms @entity6 's room , praying for her to be healed full of life : @entity6 pictured before her illness a facebook page entitled @entity143 cites a passage from the @entity145 , which reads : ‘ ” for i know the plans i have for you , ” declares the @entity149			1
“ plans to prosper you and not to harm you , plans to give you hope and a future			0
” ’ a post from tuesday reads : ‘ we can see @entity64 ’s powers working every day and know that @entity64 has a plan for her too ! ’ children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28 - year - old , with one writing : ‘ i hope you feel better			2
i miss you , @entity165			0
’ @entity166 , as well as religious differences have come to play in ms @entity6 ’s case			1
@entity169 said : ‘ in @entity171 culture … we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter			2
’ words of love : young members of the church offered kind words to ms @entity6 , calling her ' @entity165 , ' and pleading with her to come back soon ‘ the role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient , ’ @entity183 , @entity184 , the director of @entity185 , told @entity186			1
‘ if the patient is capable of making her decisions , then that ’s where we would honour			0
’ dr @entity196 added that while it may be heart - wrenching for the parents to face , she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together			0
‘ the question is not whether she ’s going to die , it ’s how she ’s going to die			0
‘ there ’s nothing worse than losing a child , ’ she said , ‘ but there are limits to medical treatment			0
there are many things we can not fix , we can not perform miracles			0
’ dr @entity196 said that there are some practices that could help ms @entity6 ’s parents come to terms with their daughter ’s illness			1
‘ these are religious people , and they know we are all mortal , ’ she said			0
‘ being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering			0

@entity6 , 28 , is paralysed from neck down after brain tumour led to seizure
