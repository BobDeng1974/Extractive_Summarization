by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 10:35 est , 8 august 2012 the omnium is renowned for being the most arduous of all the track cycling events - you must be a jack of all trades , as good at a two - lap sprint as a 30km marathon			2
and all that pedalling clearly works up quite a thirst - as this @entity7 rider demonstrated last night			0
@entity8 was so inebriated as he left the @entity10 nightclub in @entity11 in the early hours that he had to be propped up by two friends and carried into the back of a cab to head back to the @entity15			1
few too many : the @entity7 pursuit cyclist @entity8 needs help from two friends as he leaves the @entity10 nightclub in central @entity17 early this morning the 20 - year - old from @entity19 obviously worked up quite a thirst competing in the six - race omnium event , where he finished 15th overall in an event won by @entity24 of @entity25 the cheeky smile on the 20 - year - old 's face and his bleary eyes told of a good night , though he wo n't be so pleased with the stains from the drinks thrown over him			1
the @entity19 rider stumbled out of the club but clearly had no idea where he was , hanging on to his friends for dear life with his jeans slipping down his legs			1
and there was n't even that much for him to celebrate , having finished 15th in the final standings - imagine if he 'd won the gold medal			0
a source told @entity44 : ‘ we have two tables reserved each night for @entity48 athletes to come down and celebrate			0
@entity8 was hanging out with the @entity48 athletes drinking @entity51 cocktails and our signature @entity54 drink			1
' but i think he had a bit too much and had to be propped up and supported as he left with his teammates			0
‘ the event was won by the @entity59 , with @entity61 @entity60 winning bronze - one of a handful of track events we have n't won			0
@entity8 was said to be drinking @entity10 's @entity54 cocktail , which is brandy and peach liqueur shaken with lime and sugar and topped up with @entity71 champagne it was going to take more than one bottle of water to bring @entity8 round , as his jeans make a bid for freedom one , two , three , lift ! @entity8 's friends lift him into the back of a taxi to go back to the @entity82 village the young track cyclist appears to already be asleep as he is dragged on to the back seat @entity8 in action in the @entity87 250m time trial portion of the men 's omnium event @entity8 clearly has a competitive streak - he started cycling aged 13 when the football team he played for started losing once too often			1
and he clearly won the top prize for drinking last night , as his friends look comparatively sober			0
the ' @entity94 ' cocktail on the @entity10 menu might be the most appropriate with the @entity82 going on , but by the end their ' @entity97 ' tipple would have been most relevant for @entity8			1
but the @entity7 certainly was n't alone in hitting the town last night , with athletes from all countries and sports escaping the routine of the @entity15 to let their hair down			0
the @entity106 gymnasts @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 celebrated their bronze medals in the @entity111 with a visit to @entity113 , while the @entity115 freestyle swimmer @entity114 seemed to have struck gold			1
he was seen getting intimate with a young lady on the steps outside the club , before bouncers told him to head home			0
but @entity114 was clearly happier where he was , because walking looked a bit of a challenge			0
@entity106 gymnast @entity107 leaves @entity113 nightclub early this morning cheer up ! @entity106 gymnast @entity109 was in @entity113 to celebrate his two bronze medals at the @entity127 gymnast @entity108 is shown the way out of @entity113 early this morning @entity114 , the @entity115 swimmer , getting amorous with a young lady outside @entity113 nightclub dreesens was told enough is enough as the couple spilled on to the floor @entity114 finds walking a bit of a challenge as he staggers away from the club , his lady clinging on to his shirt some of his compatriots were in @entity10 's , dressed in familiar orange colours or @entity141 body suits , but let 's hope they did n't carry their teammates all the way back to @entity146			1
and the trampolinist @entity147 wasted no time in uncorking a bottle of bubbly to celebrate @entity151 's first gold of @entity152			2
her precious metal hanging round her neck , @entity147 popped open a jeroboam bottle of @entity156 at the @entity159 's fish island @entity157 next to the @entity160			0
@entity162 swimmer @entity161 shows no signs of slowing down either			2
two nights before he was stumbling into a taxi with a number of female friends outside @entity113 and last night he left the @entity169 with two more women on his arm			2
members of the @entity115 team , some in @entity141 body suits , pose for pictures outside @entity10 's @entity151 trampolinist @entity147 celebrates with champagne after winning @entity151 's first gold @entity161 leaves the @entity169 with two female friends			1

@entity8 propped up by two friends as he staggers out of @entity11 club
@entity106 cycling and gymnastics heroes also out on the town
and who 's on @entity161 's arm this time ?
