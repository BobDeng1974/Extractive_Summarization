her distraught mother said @entity11 had been suffering from a high temperature and had a rash all over her body , but she had been reassured that all she had was a minor infection			2
mrs @entity7 reacted with anger when she discovered that the children ’s ward , @entity38 , at @entity14 had since been closed due to a ' lack of appropriately qualified staff '			1
she fears that had it been closed earlier @entity11 may still be alive today			2
' i believe she was discharged because they did n’t have enough staff to look after her , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
' the last time i saw my little girl as normal was on thursday morning when i took her to school			1
' when she came home from school i knew she was n’t very well and at 6.30pm i rang the ambulance			1
' at 7.20pm she was seen by the nurses and she was admitted to the ward at 11.38pm but just over an hour later she was examined and discharged as we were told she was “ fine to go home ”			1
' it was snowy and she had nothing on her feet			2
' i was told she had an infection and there was nothing more wrong with her breathing but she was covered in a red rash			2
the four - year - old , from @entity21 , @entity22 , went downhill after she was discharged and rushed by ambulance to @entity24 , where she was declared dead around 5pm ' on friday she was not eating or drinking but we were told unless her temperature came back there was nothing to worry about			0
to me it did n’t look right			0
' although she briefly appeared to rally on saturday she then went downhill rapidly			0
she died later that afternoon			2
' i kept checking her temperature and encouraging her to come downstairs , ' said mrs @entity7 , who has another child , two - year - old @entity72 , with husband @entity73			1

i was told to sort out an overnight bag			0

' when i read the @entity38 has been closed that sent me so angry and i started shaking			0

i believe had they given her penicillin she would be alive today			0
