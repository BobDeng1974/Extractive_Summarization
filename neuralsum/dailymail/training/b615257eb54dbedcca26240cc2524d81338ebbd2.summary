@entity0 , minister of tourism and culture , said the government will not put ' any more money ' into the troubled airline the @entity6 tourism minister has said the government will not inject any more money into the state - owned @entity9 after the @entity11 disaster			1
the ailing national carrier has suffered a slump in bookings and Â£ 750 million losses following the disappearance of the flight two months ago and is undergoing ' restructuring '			1
@entity0 , minister of tourism and culture , said the government will not put ' any more money ' into the troubled airline			1
@entity9 - which is owned by the government through a holding company - had already suffered $ 1.3billion losses over the past three years as it faced stiff competition and unprofitable routes , @entity21 reports			1
mr @entity0 said that the government is now unsure what it can do - but he added : ' to inject new capital is certainly not an option			1
' it now looks unlikely that the government will sell the national carrier to private investor after the share price dropped both under the restructuring plans and the flight mh370 disaster			1
@entity0 - speaking at the @entity39 to plug the tourism industry in @entity6 - also revealed that there has been a 30 per cent in drop off in tourism numbers from @entity44 in the past two months			1
most of those onboard the missing flight were from @entity44			1
experts have narrowed the area where the plane is presumed to have crashed to a large arc of the @entity52 about 1,600 km ( 1,000 miles ) northwest of the city of @entity54 in western @entity55			1
the aircraft could have flown for up to seven hours after it went missing , meaning that even if the cockpit recorder is found , its standard two - hour recording loop would not cover conversations during the crucial early stages of the flight			1
it comes after an international panel of experts announced they are to re-examine all of the data gathered in the hunt for the missing flight to ensure search crews have been looking in the right place			1
government officials from @entity55 , @entity44 and @entity6 yesterday pledged not to give up searching for the aircraft that disappeared almost two months ago			1
they met in the @entity71 capital to discuss the next step in the search for the missing flight , which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the @entity52 off @entity55			2
a @entity9 aircraft takes off from @entity78 : questions have been raised after the airline refused to reveal details of 2.3 tonnes of cargo aboard missing jet @entity11 that was not listed on its manifest a map shows the possible path of @entity11 as released by the @entity88 last week the area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane 's likeliest flight path based on satellite and radar data			1
starting wednesday , that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all information gathered so far in the search , which has not turned up a single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million square kilometers ( 1.8 million square miles ) of ocean			2
' we 've got to this stage of the process where it 's very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered , all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there 's no flaws in it , the assumptions are right , the analysis is right and the deductions and conclusions are right , ' @entity105 , head of the search operation , told reporters in @entity123			2
investigators have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on march 8 during a flight from @entity78 to @entity129			2
a weeklong search for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk			2
' unfortunately , all of that effort has found nothing , ' @entity71 transport minister @entity134 said			2
' we 've been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one , but in practice , that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft			2
' @entity105 has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year			0
@entity149 safety officials have today put forward tougher rules for ' black box ' flight recorders in the strongest regulatory reaction yet to the disappearance of @entity11			0
the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) said it would propose increasing the recording time on cockpit voice recorders to 20 hours from two to make it easier to understand plane accidents and prevent vital evidence being overwritten			0
newly published proposals would also bring into force recommendations made by @entity164 crash investigators after the loss of an @entity167 jet in the @entity168 in 2009 , but which remain bogged down in talks among regulators			0
these include the addition of a new pinger frequency making it easier to locate the recording devices under water , where lower frequencies travel further			0
the proposals appeared in an opinion published by @entity155 on tuesday			0
they have been submitted to the @entity181 's executive commission which will use them as the basis for a change in law			0
' the proposed changes are expected to increase safety by facilitating the recovery of information by safety investigation authorities , ' @entity155 executive director @entity185 said in a statement			0
@entity155 also brought forward to 2018 a deadline for extending the battery life on black box emergency locator beacons to 90 days from 30			0
all passenger aircraft have two flight recorders - one for voice and one for data			0
each is equipped with a beacon designed to start emitting signals as soon as it enters water			0
the extended battery life is so far the only recommendation from the three year - investigation into the @entity167 disaster to have won full support at the @entity209 ( @entity209 ) , a @entity210 agency that coordinates safety standards			0
@entity209 agreed to back the battery life change from 2018 but @entity155 originally gave @entity149 operators another year until 2019			0
