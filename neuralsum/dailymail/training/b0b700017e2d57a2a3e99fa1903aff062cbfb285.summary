by @entity0 and @entity1 stunned : shop worker @entity2 , 35 , was shocked to answer her mobile and hear @entity4 on the end of the line			1
he reassured her about her decision to keep her unborn child pope @entity4 has telephoned a woman who wrote to him to tell her he will baptise her unborn after she refused to have an abortion			1
the call was the latest in a string of ' one to ones ' @entity4 has had with general members of the public and once again underlined his attempts at being a more human and in - touch pontiff after the ' stuffy ' years of his predecessor @entity21			1
shop worker @entity2 , 35 , was on holiday when she received the call from the @entity25 pope , who was elected in march this year			1
@entity2 , from @entity26 near @entity27 , central @entity28 , had written to @entity4 earlier this summer to describe her turmoil at having discovered she was pregnant by a man , who unknown to her , was already married with a child and who demanded she terminate the pregnancy			1
in her letter she described to the @entity4 her dilemma and said to him : ' i have never been lucky with men , i married when i was young and then things did n't work out and i got divorced			1
i then had a few brief relationships until i met a man who i thought was the man of my dreams			2
' in june i discovered i was pregnant through him and when i told him instead of being happy he told me he was already married , already had a child and to have an abortion			2
' i told him that i would not have an abortion and told him to get out of my life			2
' @entity2 added how she was ' in a desperate and anguished state ' and that she was writing to @entity4 because she had ' no - one else to turn to , after being left humiliated and betrayed '			1
speaking from her home she added : ' i addressed the letter simply to @entity4 , the @entity54 and put it in the post			2
i did n't even send it recorded delivery			0
i did n't really expect to get a reply but then out of the blue when i was on holiday i had a phone call from him			2
' the number was from @entity64 , with a 06 dial code , and as soon as he started speaking i recognised the voice as his			1
' i was just so surprised that he had telephoned me			0
he said that he had read my letter and he wanted to speak to me personally about it and reassure me that someone was worried about me			0
' we were only on the phone for a few minutes but my heart was filled with joy , as we spoke i was rubbing my tummy at the same time			0
it 's the @entity4 here ' : pope @entity4 spoke with ms @entity2 for a few minutes , and she said her ' heart was filled with joy ' ' i had only seen the @entity4 once before , from @entity81 when i lived in @entity64 , i would never have imagined that the @entity4 would pick up a telephone and call me and speak to me as if i was a dear friend			1
' he reassured me and said a child was a gift from @entity85 , a sign of @entity87 and that i would never be left alone			0
he said that as @entity89 we should never be afraid			0
' he told me i had been very brave and strong for my unborn child			0
i told him that i wanted to baptise the baby when it was born but i was afraid as i was divorced and a single mother but he said he would be my spiritual father and he would baptise my baby			0
' i 'm not sure if he will , i feel as if i am dreaming but if he did baptise my baby it would be something else , that telephone call has changed my life			0
' i hope my letter will be an example for other women who feel they may be distant from the @entity101 simply because they have chosen the wrong man , they are divorced or they are with men who are not worthy of being fathers			0
' i do n't know the sex of the baby but if the @entity4 does baptise it and it 's a boy i have no doubt of his name - francis			1
' popular new pope : a view of @entity81 during the inauguration mass of @entity4 , @entity54 , on march 19 this year the phone call was the latest in a string that @entity4 has made since he was elected and underlines his hands on , man of the people style which has also recently included him posing for a ' selfie ' photograph with a group of tourists inside @entity123			1
he usually makes his calls from a landline in his office and simply says ' hello			0
it 's the @entity4 , ' to the amazement of recipients who have included an @entity28 student last month , as well as a man whose brother was killed , his local newsagent back home in @entity136 to cancel his newspapers and a shoemaker to tell him not to bother making the traditional and expensive bright red papal loafer shoes			1
a @entity54 spokesman said : ' i know nothing of this telephone call but then again we knew nothing of the others			0
the @entity4 does n't tell us when he makes these calls - he just does them and then we find out about them later			2

@entity2 was on holiday when her mobile rang with an unknown @entity64 number
she was stunned to hear @entity4 on the other end reassuring her
@entity2 wrote to the @entity4 about her worries about having a baby with a man who was already married and tried to *convince* her to have an abortion
new @entity4 has also telephoned an @entity28 student and a man whose brother was killed and shows a more personable side to the @entity165 *leader*
