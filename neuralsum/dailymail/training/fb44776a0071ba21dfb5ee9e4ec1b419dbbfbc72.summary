‘ this fundamental human right has been rendered null and void through abuse of technological developments by states and corporations for mass surveillance purposes			2
' surveillance violates the private sphere and compromises freedom of thought and opinion			2
mass surveillance treats every citizen as a potential suspect			2
it overturns one of our historical triumphs : the presumption of innocence			0

we think it 's undermining democracy totally , and we are shocked that more people are n't up in arms about it , ’ said @entity32 writer @entity31			1
@entity31 said she does n't believe writers are threatened more than ordinary citizens by mass surveillance , but their work makes them particularly attuned to its dangers			2
‘ i think it 's quite significant when you have 560 or so of the greatest contemporary writers , from all across the world , expressing a very serious concern , because these are people who always work on the big philosophical questions of life , ’ @entity31 said			1
‘ hopefully their concern matters to politicians			0

@entity31 , who lives in @entity33 , said she hopes @entity38 will join the writers ' outrage over mass surveillance by adding their names to a public version of the appeal			1
' this undermines all the freedoms and values that i otherwise love about @entity38 , ' @entity31 said			2
' so i ca n't understand why @entity38 can accept mass surveillance in this way , it 's totally against the freedom ideals			1
