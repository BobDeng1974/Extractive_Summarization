a new vaccine designed to protect against the human papilloma virus prevents 90 per cent of cervical cancers , scientists have claimed the vast majority of cervical cancers could be prevented thanks to a new vaccine designed to target the human papilloma virus , scientists claim			1
the new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine , @entity10 , which protects against only two cancer - causing types of @entity13			1
in the @entity15 , the current vaccine is offered to girls aged 12 - 13 ; in the @entity18 , hpv vaccines are offered to those aged 11 and 12			1
the new jab protects against nine strains of the virus , seven of which cause most cases of cervical cancer			1
scientists at @entity28 in @entity29 found the new vaccine , @entity10 9 , is 97 per cent effective at protecting against high - grade cervical , vulvar and vaginal disease caused by five types of @entity13			1
it is also as effective as the current vaccine in preventing diseases triggered by four hpv strains			1
scientists examined the vaccine 's effectiveness when given to more than 14,200 women , aged 16 to 26 years old			2
professor @entity42 from the university , who co-authored the study , published in the @entity45 , said : ' this is a significant achievement			1
' the new vaccine , @entity10 9 , is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers			1
' eventually this will mean less screening is needed , as women will have greater protection from the outset			2
he added : ' @entity10 9 offers the potential to increase overall cervical cancer prevention from 70 to 90 per cent , nearly eliminating this cancer among vaccinated women			1
' however , it 's crucial to remember that vaccination must be done before exposure to the virus			0
' our focus for prevention must be on girls aged 12 to 13 , as the current @entity15 vaccine programme is doing , but the vaccine may also be appropriate for women 25 to 45 as part of a screening appointment			1
' until late last year there were just two vaccines available globally to protect against @entity13 related diseases			0
in the @entity15 , @entity10 is used to protect against four types and offers around 70 per cent protection against cervical cancer			1
it also significantly reduces the risk of other types of cancer and genital warts			0
however , scientists have been trying to find a way of completely eliminating cervical cancer and other @entity13 related diseases by adding five more cancer - inducing hpv strains			1
@entity10 9 marks an important step in that direction , the researchers said			1
@entity13 is the most commonly sexually transmitted virus			0
many people who are infected clear the virus from their systems with no lasting health complications and most types of the virus are low risk , causing warts or verrucas			0
@entity10 is given to girls aged 12 and 13 as a vaccination against @entity13			2
but the new version , @entity10 9 is a ' significant achievement ' experts said , adding it will mean fewer women need to take part in screening programmes in future but other types are deemed high risk , causing cervical cancer , and in fewer cases vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal and throat cancers			1
the majority of cervical cancer cases occur as a result of infection with high risk strains of @entity13			1
cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cancer in women across the world , with more than half a million cases and 250,000 deaths each year worldwide			1
in the @entity15 around 3,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and in 2011 there were around 970 deaths			1
in @entity15 all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the hpv vaccine as part of the @entity135 vaccination programme			2
professor @entity42 added : ' following these important findings , this vaccine has been licensed in the @entity18 and approval is currently being sought in the @entity15 and other countries			1
' it is encouraging that the @entity142 on @entity143 is reviewing @entity10 9 in light of this new evidence			2
' last december , the @entity146 approved @entity10 9 for use in girls aged nine to 26 and men aged nine to 15			1
around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer , pictured under the microscope , are diagnosed each year in the @entity15 what is hpv ? the human papilloma virus is the name given to a group of viruses that affect a person 's skin as well as the membranes lining the body - for example , in the cervix , anus , mouth and throat			1
@entity13 is very common and highly contagious			0
more than three quarters of sexually active women acquiring it at some point in their lives			0
and in the @entity18 it is the most common sexually - transmitted infection			2
the human papilloma virus is a group of more than 100 viruses that affect a person 's skin , and membranes lining the cervix , anus , mouth and throat most people are oblivious to the fact they have been infected and as a result can pass it on to a partner without realising			0
there are more than 100 types of @entity13 - around 40 of which affect the genital area			0
what does hpv infection do ? the majority ( nine in 10 ) of infections disappear of their own accord within two years			0
but the other 10 per cent of infections can cause health problems , including : the types of @entity13 that cause genital warts are different to those infections that cause cancer			0
other hpv infections can cause more minor problems , including common skin warts and verrucas			0
how do people get @entity13 ? @entity13 is a sexually - transmitted infections			0
in most cases a person will become infected after having vaginal and / or anal sex			0
men and women can also become infected through oral and other sex play			0
in many cases a person will not realise they are infected , and can still have hpv years after coming into contact with an infected person			2
in very rare cases a pregnant woman can pass @entity13 to her baby during delivery			0
in these cases a child can develop recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ( @entity222 ) , a rare condition where warts grow in the throat			0
the hpv vaccine a national vaccination programme for @entity13 is in place in the @entity18 and @entity15 for girls aged 12 and 13			1
three injections are given within a 12 - month period by a nurse			0
the vaccine is given at a young age because it needs to be administered before a person comes into contact with @entity13			0
it has also been found to provide greater immune response in preteens , than it does in older teenagers and young women			0
clinical trials have showed the vaccines provide close to 100 per cent protection against precancers and for @entity247 - genital warts			0
since it was first recommended in 2006 , there has been a 56 per cent reduction in hpv infections among teenage girls in the @entity18			2
protection offered should be long - lasting , with trials showing the vaccine lasts in the body for at least 10 years			2
hpv vaccination does not replace the need for regular cervical smear tests in women between the age of 25 and 65			2

current vaccine used in the @entity15 , @entity10 , protects against 4 hpv strains , two of which cause most cases of cervical cancer - offering 70 **%** protection
but scientists believe a new jab , @entity10 9 , could protect against 90 **%** of cases of cervical cancer following a trial of more than 14,000 women
experts have hailed the study a ' significant achievement ' and say its use will mean less screening will be needed in future
*gardasil* 9 has already been approved for use by the @entity146 in @entity18
authorities are in *process* of approving it in the @entity15 and other countries
