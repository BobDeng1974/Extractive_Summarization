spiders are growing far larger in the city than in rural environments , researchers have said			2
they found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation , golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of @entity9 , @entity10 , were larger and had more babies			1
the say city an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame			0
city - dwelling orb - weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins , researchers say			1
golden orb weaver spiders , known as @entity22 , are found in @entity23 in @entity10 , @entity24 and some @entity26 islands			1
they are characterised by bright , vibrantly coloured abdomens and produce webs up to one metre , which appear a golden colour			2
females are often three or four times larger than males and , although they do have venom			0
' city - dwelling orb - weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows , ' said @entity41 of the @entity42 , who led the research			1
this study shows invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities			2
' our findings show the impact urbanisation can have on local wildlife			2
' while many species do not survive encroaching urbanisation and the consequent loss of native habitat , others have a more complex relationship with man - made changes to the landscape			0
' the researchers collected golden orb - weaving spiders ( @entity63 ) from across the @entity64			1
the spiders are abundant on @entity10 's coast in both urban and natural environments and , once matured , remain in the same location for the rest of their lives			2
' we quantified the degree of urbanisation of 20 sites then looked at changes in the spiders ' body size , fat reserves and ovary weight , ' ms @entity41 said			2
the results show spiders in areas with more vegetation cover had smaller bodies and larger bodies when located in urbanised areas , characterised by increased housing and population density and hard surfaces such as roads and buildings			0
the authors also found that the spiders ' reproductive ability , measured by increased ovary weight , appeared to increase in urban areas			0
the spiders are particularly fond of @entity100 , @entity9 's eastern suburbs , just a km away from @entity102 ' two reasons likely to explain the differences between these spiders in urban and non-urban environments are temperature and prey availability			1
' hard surfaces and lack of vegetation lead to the well - known ' urban heat island ' effect with more heat retained than in areas with continuous vegetation			0
higher temperature is associated with increased growth and size in invertebrates			0
@entity42 ecologist @entity121 found that spiders thrive in @entity9 's rich suburbs ' urban lighting also may be a contributing factor as it attracts insects and means more food for spiders in those environments			1
' this increase in prey would result in bigger , heavier , more fecund spiders			0
the study , published in the journal @entity135 , examined 222 spiders collected between april and june 2012			1
researchers wrote : ' habitat modifications significantly alter species distributions and can result in increased abundance of select species which are able to exploit novel ecosystems			0
' @entity144 size was negatively associated with vegetation cover at a landscape level , and positively associated with hard surfaces and anthropogenic disturbance on a local and microhabitat scale			0
' the larger size and increased reproductive capacity of the spider in urban areas show that some species benefit from the habitat changes associated with urbanisation			0
' the research found the largest golden orb weighed three grams , and their webs can measure up to three metres			1
the smaller spiders were found in rural sites such as the @entity163 , near the @entity164 - north of @entity9 , where the smallest measured 0.5 grams .			1

the research was conducted by *phd* student @entity167 from the @entity42
her study *revealed* golden orb weaving spiders are fatter and more fertile at @entity100 , @entity9 's eastern suburbs
she said this will help control pest like flies , *mosquitoes* and other insects
the findings were published in *science* journal @entity183 on *wednesday*
