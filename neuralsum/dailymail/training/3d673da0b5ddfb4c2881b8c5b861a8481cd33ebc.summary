two @entity1 executives could face the sack over the botched @entity4 investigation that falsely linked @entity5 to child abuse allegations			1
the reputation of @entity4 hit a new low last night after a damning report accused the flagship @entity11 programme of failing to carry out ‘ basic checks ’ on its report			1
disciplinary proceedings began as soon the report was delivered to the new @entity1 management and the @entity19 , which could result in a decision to sack those responsible			1
@entity22 , right , could be in the firing line along with @entity4 's acting editor @entity24 , left , following their involvement in the show both @entity24 , @entity4 's acting editor , and @entity29 , the supervising executive seconded from his job running @entity32 , were involved with the broadcast and could be in the firing line			1
@entity1 @entity36 director , @entity35 , was given the job of heading the investigation and ruled there had been an ‘ unacceptable ’ failure to properly establish the veracity of the allegations			1
in addition , a ‘ highly complex ’ investigation had been commissioned and screened in a matter of five days but no one appeared to know who was in overall charge , the internal inquiry found			0
the november 2 report had focused on historical allegations of abuse at a children ’s home and featured two victims alleging a leading @entity57 politician from the @entity59 era had been among the abusers			0
catalyst : the crisis for @entity5 was all started by @entity4 's ' shabby ' investigation into abuse at a @entity66 children 's home falsely implicated : pictured left , @entity5 , whose name was smeared because of errors in the programme and right , @entity35 , whose investigation shows basic checks were neglected the politician was not named in the programme but the coverage prompted a storm on @entity77 , with many inaccurately naming @entity5 as the perpetrator			1
the peer was forced to issue a statement denying his involvement , and one of the victims later said the person who abused him was not the person he had identified as @entity5			0
@entity89 ’s report said editorial failings on that @entity4 included the fact that : ‘ identification of the alleged perpetrator was not confirmed by photograph with the first victim			2
the second victim could not be traced in order to provide up to date corroboration			0
’ it added that no ‘ right of reply ’ was offered to the unnamed individual at the centre of the investigation			0
@entity89 outlined a serious of issues that contributed to the broadcast of the inaccurate edition of @entity4			2
he stated a ‘ highly complex ’ story went to air very quickly , suggesting not enough time was set aside to properly research it			0
it was commissioned on october 28 and was then aired on november 2			0
the @entity1 worked with the @entity113 on the story , but took ultimate editorial responsibility once it was commissioned			2
@entity89 said the programme ’s management structure had been ‘ seriously weakened ’ because editor @entity118 had stood aside pending an investigation into the shelving of the @entity4 investigation into allegations of child abuse against @entity124			1
paying the price : @entity127 's evidence formed part of the botched programme which resulted in @entity131 's resignation a deputy editor had also left the programme – and so the remainder of the team were under ‘ very considerable pressure ’			0
he also found that because it was not clear if this programme was ‘ regarded as @entity139 - related ’ , there was confusion over who took ultimate responsibility for the report			2
this is because the @entity1 had been operating a two - tier system with one set of executives in charge of output relating to @entity139 , and another set in charge of day - to - day programming			0
he said : ‘ there was a different understanding by the key parties about where the responsibility lay for the final editorial sign - off for the story on the day			0
’ a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ it is clear from the @entity89 report on the november 2 @entity4 that there were serious failures in the normal checks and balances that the @entity19 expects from @entity1 journalism			1
’ the corporation said it was now reverting to a ‘ single chain of command ’ on all output – savile related or otherwise – and was installing @entity171 as acting editor of @entity4			2
initial debacle : @entity118 stood down after the @entity1 ran a tribute to @entity124 ( right ) rather than the investigation into his crimes			1

@entity35 's report shows depth of confusion in @entity1 after @entity118 resigned over @entity182 *scandal*
@entity24 , @entity4 's acting director , and @entity29 , supervising executive , could be in the firing line after involvement
