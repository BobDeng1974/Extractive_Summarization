a woman has taken it upon herself to show how conventional standards of beauty are shifted when a biracial identity is involved			0
journalist @entity5 , who is half - @entity6 and half - black , sent a photo of herself to editors in various countries across the world in a bid to see how they would use @entity13 to make it beautiful according to their cultural standards			1
she found that in contrast to similar projects in the past that have resulted in a huge variety of changes , people seemed to be at a loss as to how to improve her unique face			0
@entity5 was inspired after seeing the results journalist @entity45 had when she asked 40 people in 25 different countries to ' make her look beautiful ' with the help of @entity13			1
but when @entity5 did the same , the results were drastically different			2
' as a biracial woman there is no standard of beauty or mold that can easily fit my face , ' she writes on her blog			0
' i am living in a culture that 's still adjusting to my kind of face			0
' @entity61 : the @entity13 job is barely noticeable - just a slight lightening of her skin tone and her lips made a shade pinker @entity68 : an editor here made her completely unrecognizable by thinning out her face significantly , shrinking her nose , thinning her lips , coloring her eyes green and setting them further apart @entity75 : @entity5 's skin is given a dewy glow and her brown eyes are edited to look a shade lighter indeed , the edited versions of @entity5 's photo show just how much of a challenge the project seemed to be , with many countries hardly altering her at all , while others did so to an unrecognizable extreme			1
in @entity61 , for instance , the @entity13 job is barely noticeable - just a slight lightening of her skin tone and her lips made a shade pinker			0
and in @entity75 her skin is given a dewy glow , and her brown eyes - edited to look a shade lighter than they are in real life - are lined in black eyeliner			2
@entity102 : ' as a biracial woman there is no standard of beauty or mold that can easily fit my face , ' she explains			0
pictured : an @entity102 editor 's mind - boggling @entity13 job @entity102 : another person in the @entity102 , however , hardly touched her picture , simply making her skin a more even tone and filtering the photo in a glowing light @entity111 : @entity5 is given a full face of make - up and her eyes are colored green @entity115 : blue eyes , full pink lips , wide , almond - shaped blue eyes , thicker brows and a smaller jaw make @entity121 look like a completely different woman the countries that did the most digital editing went so far as to make her completely unrecognizable			1
@entity68 , for example , thinned out her face significantly , shrunk her nose , thinned her lips , colored her eyes green and set them further apart , seemingly creating a whole new woman			2
and one of the editors in the @entity102 went even more extreme by giving her long wavy extensions and bangs , dark red lipstick , bright green eyes and fuller , more upturned lips			0
@entity139 : one of the more startling transformations , this editor shrunk her head until it looked disproportionate to the rest of her body @entity145 : her photo is edited so that she has a more even skin tone and wide - set eyes @entity149 : in this photo , the only noticeable difference is that her skin is lightened another person in the @entity102 , however , hardly touched her picture , simply making her skin a more even tone and filtering the photo in a glowing light			1
' in contrast to @entity45 's results , where her face became a canvas to express more than a dozen contrasting beauty standards , i found that my face actually challenged the application of @entity13 in this instance , ' writes @entity5			1
thanks to her personal experience as a biracial woman , she fully expected the results of her project to be jarringly different to those of ms @entity45			2
@entity174 : here she was simply given a lick of light blue eyeshadow , a smaller jaw and a slightly thinner nose @entity179 : @entity179 was apparently totally baffled as to how to make her beautiful , which resulted in her picture being made oddly transparent and given a pinkish tone @entity181 : here she has a lighter skin tone , thinner face and dark eyeliner ' i was taught that my natural self did not comply with conventional standards set forth by society , saying fairer skin is better , straighter hair is more attractive , and that skinny tastes good , ' she explains			1
one of the more mind - boggling transformations was done by a picture editor in @entity139 , who shrunk her head until it looked disproportionate to the rest of her body			0
she told @entity200 : ' in these images my @entity39 and @entity36 aesthetics are combined with @entity203 , @entity205 and @entity206 features , either pigeon holing me into a more narrow racial understanding or reaching an entirely new level of racial ambiguity			1
' @entity211 : barely noticeable changes include lighter skin and eyes @entity215 : her skin is lightened and has peachy undertones , and her dark brown eyes are altered to appear more hazel @entity221 : @entity5 is again transformed into a completely different person , with a much smaller , rounder face , almond - shaped eyes , a long neck , a skinnier nose and smaller lips @entity179 was apparently totally baffled as to how to make her beautiful , which resulted in her picture being made oddly transparent and given a pinkish tone			1
and in @entity221 , @entity5 was transformed into a completely different person , with a much smaller , rounder face , almond - shaped eyes , a long neck , a skinnier nose and smaller lips			1
meanwhile , in @entity174 , she was simply given a lick of light blue eyeshadow , a smaller jaw and a slightly thinned nose			0
@entity239 : ' i am living in a culture that 's still adjusting to my kind of face , ' she says			0
in @entity239 , she is given lighter skin and lighter eyes @entity246 : the shape of her mouth is changed , and again the editor lightened her skin @entity251 : here @entity5 has slightly yellower skin and fuller , more pink - hued lips @entity5 says she feels that her project is especially timely since the world is witnessing a massive growth in mixed - raced populations			1
' it appears that the genetic makeup of our society is likely to continue to diversify further and further , ' she told @entity200			0
' and as one of those changing faces of @entity102 , i wanted to see how photo - shoppers would change ( or not change ) a " changing face " '			0
she added that she hopes her photo series creates ' a dialogue that specifically addresses race and ethnic features in an industry where beauty standards are apparently eurocentric			2

in @entity75 , the @entity181 and @entity221 , @entity5 's skin was lightened , and in @entity68 , her ambiguous @entity39 and @entity36 features were *replaced* with an entirely new racial identity , making her unrecognizable
she was inspired by journalist @entity45 's original project in which she sent her photo to 40 people in 25 countries with the *request* ' make me look beautiful '
