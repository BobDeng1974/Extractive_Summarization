by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 have suffered a major blow ahead of the start of the new season after @entity7 was ruled out for between six to eight weeks			1
the @entity8 international , who recently committed his future to his boyhood club by signing a new four - year deal , has suffered a knee ligament injury in training and his absence will cause a major headache for manager @entity18			1
@entity7 was hurt during training at the club 's @entity21 headquarters on friday and was seen leaving with his leg in a supportive brace			1
the best case scenario is that he will be able to return within six weeks but , even still , he will be a big miss for @entity3 , who have a demanding opening to the campaign that includes assignments against @entity44 and @entity45 before the end of the month			2
if @entity7 is out for eight weeks , however , he will miss @entity3 's return to @entity48 on september 18 , as well as the first @entity50 derby at @entity51 on september 27			2
not only that , he will be ruled out of @entity8 's forthcoming friendly against @entity53 at @entity54 and the opening @entity56 qualifier against @entity57			0
there is no indication yet whether @entity7 requires surgery to correct the damage , which was suffered in an accidental collision			0
that , however , will be no solace to @entity18 , who has frequently championed @entity7 's ability and made the 20 - year - old one of the key figures in his starting line - up			0
headache : @entity3 boss @entity18 had made @entity7 one of the key figures in his starting line - up			0
