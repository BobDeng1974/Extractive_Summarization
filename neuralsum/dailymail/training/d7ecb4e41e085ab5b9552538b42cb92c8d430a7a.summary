architect @entity0 , 68 , who was left unable to speak , read or write following a stroke , has learned how to communicate by drawing plans of houses an architect who was paralysed by a stroke has learned to communicate again in the only way he can remember - by drawing plans of houses			1
@entity0 , 68 , from @entity9 , was left unable to speak , read or write and also lost movement down his right hand side following the brain haemorrhage - which led to the stroke - in 2005			1
but he has since developed a unique method of interacting with his wife @entity15 using the architect 's eye that he developed during his career			1
right - handed mr @entity0 uses his left hand to drawn plans of their home to get his point across and direct his wife to what he needs			1
if mr @entity0 wants some fruit from the kitchen he starts by drawing a plan of his house , working down towards the kitchen where the fruit bowl is			1
and if he wants to go outside , he will draw an image of the couple 's garden , using a series of lines			2
mrs @entity37 , 56 , says it can take all day to work out what he wants and that it recently took from the morning to the evening to discover he wanted a banana			1
his wife says simple conversations can last all day , but that she has been amazed at what her husband has been able to achieve			2
she said : ' when he had his stroke he was also hit with aphasia , a condition that affects a person 's ability to speak , read , or write			1
he now has to draw with his left hand			1
' but it did n't take away his ability to see things as architects do , that bird 's eye view			1
' if , for example , @entity0 wants some fruit , it would be too hard for him to just draw this because of the aphasia so he would draw a map of the house and focus on the kitchen and work down through the drawn plans to the core of what he wants			1
' we might start a conversation in the morning and not finish until later in the day because it is hard work to know what he is saying , but we stick with it			2
' she added : ' he loves to be out in the garden and will also draw the plan of that when he wants to go there			2
' he still has the architect 's eye when he is out there as well , although he can not do any of the physical work			1
' it has been life changing			1
we are so lucky that his career before his stroke was what it was			2
he loved it and it is what is helping him live a better life			2
the couple only met one year before mr @entity0 's stroke , which left the then fit and active 58 - year - old in hospital for six months			1

' this is just the life journey that we are on			0
it is different from where we started but there is always a way forward			0
' mr @entity0 worked as an architect for 35 years in the @entity118 branch of real estate company @entity119			1
his job involved drawing up plans for colleges , schools , warehouses , homes and offices , for projects all over the @entity128			2

likewise , if he wants to go outside , he draws the couple 's garden despite his dehibilitating stroke ten years ago , mr @entity0 can now draw a series of simple sketches she said : ' although he has to do the drawings with his left hand , you can still see the architect plans in everything he does			1
' i do n't have any real knowledge of buildings - but that is the language he talks so we have made it work			0
' his language is extremely limited			0
it can be very difficult - a bit like the @entity161 game at times			0
' talking about the stroke , mrs @entity37 said : ' our lives changed overnight			1
he was on the floor in the bedroom and had been there for 12 hours before an ambulance got to him			0
that was why he was so badly affected as there was no early intervention			0
' @entity0 had no communication at all			2
he lost every form of understanding			0
he could not walk , talk or move			0
' he was in hospital for six months and even when he came home communication was virtually impossible			0
' i initially tried all sorts of different programmes as i had worked in schools for children with disabilities			0
it was all down to how @entity0 's brain was switched on			2
' communicating through the drawings just evolved i guess			0
it was probably about three years after his stroke that we discovered it			0
he had to learn to wash , shave and do every basic thing again			0
' it was like he was a new - born			0
but we got to the point where we developed an understanding of how to communicate with sketches			0
' i think he had been trying to do it for a while			0
but my acceptance of it was the big breakthrough			0
he had retained his skills as an architect			0
it was such a part of him that he never lost it			0
' @entity206 from the charity connect that supports stroke and aphasia sufferers , said mr @entity0 's achievements were remarkable			1
she said : ' people with aphasia have full comprehension but ca n't communicate , which is very frustrating and isolating			0
' @entity0 communicates beautifully by drawing pictures , the most beautiful and precise pictures			2
his achievements are mammoth and we are all very proud of him			0
