@entity0 yesterday demanded publication of the long - delayed official report into the @entity3 before the general election as relatives of soldiers killed in the conflict complained of ‘ the biggest cover - up of our time ’			1
the deputy prime minister said he would be ‘ very disappointed ’ if the @entity12 does not conclude before voters go to the polls next may			1
‘ i very , very much want to see this @entity17 report published because it is not fair on the relatives , ’ mr @entity0 told @entity15			1
’ @entity32 , from @entity33 , who lost her 19 - year - old son @entity34 in @entity35 in 2004 , said : ‘ if they have nothing to hide , why wo n’t they publish the report ? it ’s the biggest cover up of our time			1
’ sir @entity43 was asked to investigate the @entity3 by @entity44 in 2009 and last took evidence from a witness three years ago			0
@entity47 said last year that he hoped the difficulties surrounding publication of his conclusions would be ‘ concluded as soon as possible ’			1
but the declassification of key documents , and the so - called ‘ @entity54 ’ process , the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government - commissioned report , has dragged on			2
despite growing anger over the wait for publication of sir @entity43 ’s findings , senior @entity60 figures now believe it is now unlikely to see the light of day until after the election			1
unless it is published very early next year , it is thought that it will be judged too politically contentious so close to polling day			0
@entity72 strategists are said to be concerned at the prospect the spectre of @entity35 being raised in the months before the election , since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters into the arms of the @entity81 in 2005 and 2010			1
former prime minister @entity82 ( pictured ) has insisted he has nothing to do with the delay in publication of the report @entity82 , who is expected to be criticised , insisted he has nothing to do with the delay in publication			2
the inquiry has already been condemned as a whitewash over a deal to keep letters and notes of phone calls between mr @entity82 and @entity96 private			0
cabinet secretary sir @entity97 has vetoed the release of the correspondence in the run - up to the 2003 conflict , insisting that only their ‘ gist ’ is included in sir @entity43 ’s findings			2
in them , mr @entity82 is said to have promised the @entity106 president : ‘ you know , @entity96 , whatever you decide to do , i ’m with you			0
’ the official reason for the censorship is that publication would deter prime ministers from speaking freely in private			2
but @entity60 sources claim security chiefs and officials in @entity117 have been firmly against their release			1
sir @entity43 said the inquiry now hopes to publish ‘ gists and quotes ’ from some of the messages			0
he said this was crucial in order for people to understand his conclusions			0
but the letters will not be published in full and any quotes will be kept to the ‘ minimum necessary ’ , and following the protests from the @entity106 , no details of mr @entity96 ’s messages will be published			0
mr @entity0 added : ‘ i would like to see this report			1
i would have liked to have seen it published a long time ago			2
but when this report was set up , quite rightly it was set up entirely independent of politicians			0
‘ if this was run by politicians people would immediately suspect it to be a stitch - up			2
‘ sir @entity43 will have to explain himself but my understanding , but i very much stress from a distance , is that first the sheer volume of material , millions and millions and millions of documents … they ’ve been sifting through that			0
‘ but then there ’s this process which i guess common sense dictates is fair , that those individuals , so the politicians , particularly the politicians of the day in the @entity72 government of the day that decided on our behalf in my catastrophically and very wrongly to go to war in @entity35 , that those individuals who are in any way criticised or commented upon have a right which is fair enough to reply			1
‘ [ but ] i very much hope that people who are running the @entity163 , punctilious though they clearly are being , also feel a heavy weight of responsibility towards the families that they really do need to try and bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible			0
‘ i mean , every prospective sort of timetable or deadline or publication date appears to have slipped			0

@entity0 demands publication of the @entity12 prior to election
relatives of those killed in @entity35 call it ' the biggest cover - up of our time '
but senior @entity60 figures believe it will not see light until after election
