by @entity0 elderly patients could be given unhealthy treats to encourage them to eat , a leading doctor said junk food should be served to older patients on wards to prevent malnutrition , the health boss in charge of hospital food has said			1
elderly people could be given unhealthy treats such as doughnuts , ice cream and chips in order to encourage them to eat as part of an overhaul of hospital food			1
dr @entity20 , head of environment at the @entity22 , who is responsible for policy on hospital food , said it was more important patients ate food they liked rather than leave healthy food uneaten			1
ministers are also concerned at the high cost of the 30million uneaten meals that are thrown away annually			2
it is feared many uneaten dishes are recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat , such as @entity37 curry			1
speaking at @entity40 conference , the doctor warned that older people at risk of not eating enough had become ‘ terrified ’ because of anti-obesity campaigns			1
dr @entity44 said : ‘ we know that patients need better nutritional care because if they do not eat enough they will get sicker quicker and better slower			1
‘ if we give them nice food it will make them feel better			1
' when you ’re poorly you almost always lose your appetite			2
you might not lose it completely , but you will go off certain things at least			0
there are virtually no serious illnesses that lead to an increase in appetite			0
‘ we know that one hundred junk calories inside is a lot better than 500 healthy calories that you just look at			1
' dr @entity44 , who is currently conducting a major review of hospital food , said promoting healthy eating was important but making sure patients ate is what ‘ worries me ’			1
she said : ‘ we could say we should concentrate on making sure that people eat			0
it does n’t matter what it is , just as long as they eat , even that food is unhealthy , we should concentrate on helping them to eat , because if we do n’t they ’ll get sicker			1
‘ but there ’s also this thought that we have to consider , maybe we should concentrate on healthy food because people are affected by obesity and the @entity80 should set a good example			2
‘ they ’re both important , but really it ’s the first that worries me			0
it ’s about getting patients to eat and particularly elderly patients			2
’ dr @entity20 said calories from items such as doughnuts , crisps and ice - cream were better for patients for nothing at all she added that there was a risk that the elderly were put off eating because of healthy eating campaigns			1
she said : ‘ i think there is an awful talked about obesity to the extent that people have become terrified of any kind of putting on weight , they see it as a bad thing			0
’ dr @entity44 is drawing up national standards , which will be issued in september as part of the hospital food review by the government and @entity40			1
it follows concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times , risking malnutrition and dehydration			2
many are too frail even to open cling - film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed			0
ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30 million uneaten meals are thrown away annually			0
it is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat , like @entity37 curry			2
@entity134 , chairman of @entity135 , who is chairing the review panel , told the conference : ‘ malnutrition is a word we often associate with developing countries , but actually there are a million older people living in our community who are already malnourished or at risk at becoming so			0
‘ when older people are malnourished they are much greater risk of poor health , more likely to go into hospital , and need more time to recover			0
‘ in many cases , malnutrition is preventable with the right help and support			0
this is a hugely serious and often hidden problem			0
‘ older people and professionals tend to assume that losing weight and loss of appetite is a normal part of ageing , but that is not the case			0

dr @entity20 said treats such as doughnuts should be given to patients
she said 100 calories of junk food was better than not eating at all
