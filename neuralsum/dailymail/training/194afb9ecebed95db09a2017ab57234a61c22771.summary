by @entity1 reporter @entity2 who support the death penalty would rather see states bring back the hangman 's noose , the electric chair , the gas chamber , the firing squad - or even the guillotine - than stop executions if lethal injection is no longer available			1
a new @entity14 poll found 59percent of @entity2 support the death penalty for people convicted of murder			1
the findings reveal that the botched execution of @entity21 murderer @entity20 on april 29 has not dampened public support for capital punishment			2
no change : the botched execution of @entity21 inmate @entity20 has n't dampened public enthusiasm for execution should the @entity2 bring back other execution techniques if lethal injection is not available ? if anything , it 's made @entity2 believe more primitive methods of execution are more humane than lethal injection			1
all 35 states with the death penalty use either a cocktail of drugs or a single drug for executions			1
those drugs have become harder to get in recent years as drug makers stop production - either for financial reasons or because they do n't want to be associated with executions			2
@entity14 found large support for other means of execution			0
some 20percent say they would favor bringing back the gas chamber , 18percent would favor a return of the electric chair , 12 percent the firing squad and eight percent say hanging should be an option			1
the results of @entity14 's poll of 800 @entity2 reveals : ' the lethal injection is someone ’s very gross interpretation of killing someone humanely , ' @entity55 , @entity57 - native @entity56 , 58 , told @entity14			1
he called for return of the hanging gallows			0
' it 's very quick			0
you do n't have to worry about drugs and it 's very efficient			0
better than a firing squad - a firing squad is messy			1
there is no such thing as killing someone humanely			0
' but if hanging is done properly , it 's more humane than lethal injection because there are fewer things that can go wrong			1
' afterall , mr @entity56 said , ' that 's how they killed @entity78			0
' @entity79 , an 82 - year - old from @entity80 , @entity81 , thinks the @entity2 should look even farther back in history to find execution methods			2
' it would be quick and with a firing squad no one knows whose bullet actually killed the person , so it ’s easier on them , ' she said			2
' the most humane way is the guillotine but i ca n’t see that coming back			0
' the @entity14 poll asked questions of 800 registered voters between may 7 and 10			0
it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46percent .			0
