the date when the @entity2 ’s atmosphere became oxygen - rich and suitable for life – known as @entity4 – was thought to have occurred around 2.4 billion years ago			1
but now geologists from @entity6 and @entity7 have found evidence of an earlier short - lived oxidation event which took place 600 million years earlier			1
and they say their other research suggests the first oxygen - producing lifeforms began flourishing on @entity2 60 million years earlier than first believed			1
pictured is a sample of a 3.02 billion years ago ancient soil - or paleosol			0
here , they found evidence of chemical weathering of rocks leading to soil formation that occurred in the presence of oxygen they claim these lifeforms were responsible for adding oxygen to our atmosphere , which laid the foundations for more complex life to evolve			1
scientists working in @entity7 found evidence of chemical weathering of rocks leading to soil formation that occurred in the presence of oxygen			1
using the naturally occurring uranium - lead isotope decay system , which is used to determine the age of substances , geologists claim this took place at least 3.02 billion years ago			0
the pattern of chemical weathering preserved in the ancient soils - or paleosols - is compatible with higher atmospheric oxygen levels at that time , said scientists at @entity45 who worked alongside geologists at the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity7			1
the soil came from the @entity49 of @entity50 ( pictured ) , and was named the ' @entity51 ' there was no oxygen in the atmosphere for hundreds of millions of years after the @entity2 formed			1
today the @entity2 's atmosphere is 20 per cent oxygen thanks to photosynthetic bacteria which - like trees and other plants - consume carbon dioxide and release the gas			1
the bacteria laid the foundation for oxygen breathing organisms to evolve and inhabit the planet			0
the @entity65 , also called the @entity65 or @entity65 or @entity65 , is the name given to the first appearance of free oxygen in @entity2 's atmosphere			1
the @entity4 was about 2.4 billion years ago , but some recent evidence from @entity70 suggests there was a much earlier short - lived oxygen build - up in the atmosphere and shallow oceans at about 2.96 billion years ago.the latest study from @entity7 pushes this back even further to about 3.02 billion years ago			1
that is 60 million years than the recent estimate from @entity70 and 600 million years earlier than the @entity4			1
the soil came from the @entity49 of @entity50 , and was named the ' @entity51 ' after the nearest local town			2
these high oxygen levels could only have been produced by organisms that were capable of photosynthesis			0
' this is a very exciting finding , which helps to fill a gap in our knowledge about the evolution of the early @entity2 , ' said professor @entity89 at @entity45 , who led the study			0
' this paleosol from @entity7 is telling us that there was a short - lived pulse of atmospheric oxygenation and this occurred considerably earlier than previously envisaged			0
' the early @entity2 was very different to what we see today			0
our planet 's early atmosphere was rich in methane and carbon dioxide and had only very low levels of oxygen			2
the widely accepted model for evolution of the atmosphere states that oxygen levels did not rise significantly until about 2.4 billion years ago			0
this ' @entity4 ' event enriched the atmosphere and oceans with oxygen , and heralded one of the biggest shifts in evolutionary history			2
micro-organisms were present before three billion years ago but they were not likely capable of producing oxygen by photosynthesis , scientists claim			0
pictured is a simplified map of the southern part of the @entity49 in @entity7			0
it shows the distribution of sediments overlying the @entity51 up until very recently however , it has been unclear if any oxygenation events occurred before the @entity4 and the argument for an evolutionary capability of photosynthesis has largely been based on the first signs of an oxygen build - up in the atmosphere and oceans			2
' it is the rare examples from the rock record that provide glimpses of how rocks weathered , ' added professor @entity89			0
' the chemical changes which occur during this weathering tell us something about the composition of the atmosphere at that time			0
' very few of these paleosols have been documented from a period of @entity2 's history prior to 2.5 billion years ago			2
' the one we worked on is at least 3.02 billion years old , and it shows chemical evidence that weathering took place in an atmosphere with elevated oxygen levels			2
' there was virtually no atmospheric oxygen present 3.4 billion years ago , but recent work from @entity70 paleosols suggested that by about 2.96 billion years ago oxygen levels may have begun to increase			0
professor @entity89 's finding moves the goalposts back at least 60 million years , which , given humans have only been on the planet for around a tenth of that time , is a significant change			1
there was virtually no atmospheric @entity168 present 3.4 billion years ago , but recent work from @entity70 paleosols suggested that by about 2.96 billion years ago @entity168 levels may have begun to increase			1
pictured is the @entity171 in @entity7			0

finding is based on *analysis* of rock in @entity49 of @entity50
it found a pattern of chemical weathering preserved in the ancient soils which was compatible with higher atmospheric @entity168 levels at that time
it also pushes back the @entity4 by 600 million years
this event saw first appearance of free oxygen in @entity2 's atmosphere
