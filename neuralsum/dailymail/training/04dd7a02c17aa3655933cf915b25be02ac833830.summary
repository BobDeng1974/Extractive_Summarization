by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 10 august 2013 @entity3 militants pillaged @entity5 taxpayer - funded aid worth almost £ 500,000 , the @entity1 has admitted			1
the government said that a @entity8 - based cell of @entity3 , known as @entity9 , plundered the vital humanitarian aid and equipment from approved contractors			1
the loss was hidden in the small print of a recent set of @entity1 ( @entity1 ) accounts which revealed ‘ the theft ’ of supplies worth £ 480,000 between november 2011 and february 2012			1
loss : it is believed the supplies were stolen by @entity9 , the @entity8 - based cell of @entity3 , and burnt it is understood that the supplies were stolen or destroyed in november 2011 when @entity9 went on the rampage through an area where some of @entity1 ’s local partners had a warehouse			1
the report singles out @entity9 for blame and states : ‘ @entity1 partners had no prior warning of the confiscations being carried out and therefore had no time to prevent the loss			2
’ a @entity1 spokesman added : ‘ we work in some of the most dangerous places in the world , including @entity8 , because tackling the root causes of poverty and instability there ensures a safer world			1
' working in conflict - affected and fragile states carries inherent risk			0
@entity1 does all it can to mitigate against this but , on occasion , losses will occur			0
’ questions : aid workers struggled to deliver supplies to thousands of @entity8 refugees during the humanitarian crisis in 2011 more than 13 million people were reliant on humanitarian aid during the @entity57 crisis in november 2011			2
starving people were dying of malaria and cholera and heavy rains made it impossible for aid workers to deliver supplies			0
the disclosure that so much material went missing will raise fears that the government is not doing enough to protect aid supplies			2
ministers have been under increasing pressure to justify a decision to protect overseas aid from spending cuts			0
@entity5 aid is due to reach about £ 11 billion by 2015 to meet the government ’s promise that spending should be 0.7 per cent of gross national income			0
critics say the 0.7 per cent figure encourages wasteful spending to meet the target			0
last night @entity1 was not able to confirm what sort of supplies had been lost in @entity8 but suggested that they were burned by @entity9 rather than stolen .			1
