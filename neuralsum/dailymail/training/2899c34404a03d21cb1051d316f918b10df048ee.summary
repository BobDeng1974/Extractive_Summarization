astronomers claim @entity1 and its moons could provide the best hope of finding signs of alien life in our solar system			1
now , in an effort to explorer its distant oceans , the @entity1 icy moons explorer ( juice ) mission has been given the green light to launch in 2022			1
the five - tonne satellite will reach @entity1 in 2030 where it will use its suite of instruments to explore the planet 's atmosphere , magnetosphere and tenuous set of rings			1
now , in an effort to explorer its distant oceans , the @entity1 icy moons explorer ( juice ) mission has been given the green light to launch in 2022 ( artist 's impression pictured ) juice will also look at @entity1 's diverse @entity34 moons - volcanic @entity35 and rock - ice @entity36 and @entity38 - which make the @entity1 system a miniature solar system in its own right			1
the focus will largely be on @entity36 , though , and will the first time any icy moon has been orbited by a spacecraft			2
earlier this year , scientists said @entity36 might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers similar to a club sandwich			2
previously , the moon was thought to harbour a thick ocean sandwiched between just two layers of ice , one on top and one on bottom , but now it seems it has multiple layers			0
scientists claims that places where water and rock interact are important for the development of life			2
for example , it is possible life began on @entity70 in bubbling vents on our sea floor			0
prior to the new study , @entity36 's rocky sea bottom was thought to be coated with ice , not liquid - a problem for the emergence of life			1
it will visit @entity38 , the most heavily cratered object in the solar system , and will twice fly by @entity35			1
juice is hoping to make the first measurements of the thickness of @entity87 's icy crust and will identify candidate sites for future in situ exploration			1
the @entity92 mission found strong evidence that a subsurface ocean of salty water is in contact with a rocky seafloor			0
scientists claim @entity36 might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich it may seem strange that salt can make the ocean denser , but you can see for yourself how this works by adding table salt to a glass of water			2
rather than increasing in volume , the liquid shrinks and becomes denser			0
this is because the salt ions attract water molecules			0
the models get more complicated when the different forms of ice are taken into account			0
the ice that floats in your drinks is called ' @entity123 ' it 's the least dense form of ice and lighter than water			0
but at high pressures , like those in crushingly deep oceans like @entity36 's , the ice crystal structures become more compact			1
' it 's like finding a better arrangement of shoes in your luggage - the ice molecules become packed together more tightly , ' said @entity136			1
the ice can become so dense that it is heavier than water and falls to the bottom of the sea			0
the densest and heaviest ice thought to persist in @entity36 is called ' @entity143			2
' by modeling these processes using computers , the team came up with an ocean sandwiched between up to three ice layers , in addition to the rocky seafloor			0
@entity35 may be one of our best hopes for finding life in the solar system			1
pictured is the surface of europa scientists believe the cycling of material between the ocean and ice shell could potentially provide sources of chemical energy that could sustain simple life forms			0
it is believed that geysers spurting out of @entity1 's moon may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface			1
this was based on observations by the @entity175 in december 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon , lending evidence to the existence of jets			0
' @entity1 is the archetype for the giant planets of the @entity186 and for many giant planets being found around other stars , ' professor @entity181 , @entity183 's director of science and @entity184 , said when the mission was announced			2
' juice will give us better insight into how gas giants and their orbiting worlds form , and their potential for hosting life			0
' juice is hoping to make the first measurements of the thickness of @entity87 's icy crust and will identify candidate sites for future in situ exploration			1

@entity1 and its moons could be best hope of finding signs of alien life
@entity1 icy moons explorer ( juice ) will reach the @entity1 system in 2030
it will explore volcanic @entity35 , @entity87 and rock - ice @entity36 and @entity38
juice will also take a look at @entity1 's atmosphere and magnetosphere
