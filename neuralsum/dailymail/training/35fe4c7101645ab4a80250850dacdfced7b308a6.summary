he and combat medic @entity3 @entity2 , who pulled him to safety , were both later awarded the @entity32 for gallantry			1
dramatic details of the ‘ green - on - blue ’ massacre in a violent part of @entity37 were today described to the hearing at @entity39			1
the soldiers were on patrol on july 1 last year when they were sent to @entity42 in @entity43 to organise a shura , or meeting , for local police chiefs and civilians			1
when the troops arrived at the base it was virtually empty with just one uniformed policeman on duty			1
he explained his commander was on his way to the compound but after waiting for nearly 40 minutes the @entity58 soldiers decided to leave			2
captain @entity59 , a @entity60 who was part the @entity58 police advisory team , told the inquest : ‘ i informed the sentry we could n’t wait any longer and that we would be in touch			1
’ he said the policeman came down from the watchtower , known as a sangar , to talk face - to - face , then returned to his post			1
captain @entity59 said : ‘ as we departed we lined up in single file			1
the interpreter and i had left the compound and the other four were inside when we heard gunfire from the sangar			2
‘ initially we thought he was firing towards a threat from the outside			0
the realisation came quite quickly that was n’t what was happening			0
the officer ran back inside the checkpoint to try to rescue his stricken comrades			1
his rifle jammed but he blazed away with his pistol , firing a total of about 30 rounds at the tower			0
three soldiers died in the attack by a rogue @entity12 policeman , who opened fire from a watchtower in @entity37 last july he said : ‘ i could see the shooter through my sights , shooting in our direction			1
i was shot in the leg			1
’ he was pulled to safety by combat medic @entity103 , of the @entity104 , who had to crawl to avoid the bullets which killed his comrades			1
lance corporal @entity2 dashed outside to tell waiting comrades what was happening			2
@entity110 and @entity111 armoured vehicles rammed the closed main gate and blitzed the watchtower with machinegun fire while retrieving their stricken colleagues			0
@entity116 , of @entity117 , @entity118 , from the @entity119 , and @entity120 , from @entity121 , and @entity122 , from @entity123 , both of the @entity125 the @entity126 , were pronounced dead at @entity127			0
sir @entity1 was head of @entity8 from 2004 to 2009			1
he worked on the controversial dossier that backed the @entity130 war the killer , named as @entity132 , who was armed with an @entity134 assault rifle , was shot and captured alive			1
capt @entity59 told the inquest that the rogue policeman was not wearing body armour when they arrived at the checkpoint			1
but he said : ‘ as we left , he was			0
it triggered something in my mind but not enough			0
in hindsight he was getting ready to engage us			0
‘ with hindsight there are all sorts of things that appear to be off but at the time it did n’t seem suspicious			0
‘ we had spent time with him and not felt threatened			0
i could n’t see any way in which we could have prevented what happened			0
’ coroner @entity156 told the hearing in @entity158 : ' these men were shot in a position where they had no ability to retaliate			2
they believed they were walking out of a situation where there was no risk			0
' i ’m satisfied from the evidence before me that there is nothing to suggest that the policeman was acting other than on his own			2
' it is tempting to think this was part of a much bigger picture but certainly i have got no evidence from which i could properly make a finding that there was anybody else involved			0
' she said she could find no meaning to what happened , adding : ' i have heard from the witnesses they had no inkling that anything like this was going to happen			0
' there ’s no evidence before me there was any particular warning sign			0
' she recorded verdicts that each of the soldiers had been unlawfully killed while on active service overseas			2
she was making no formal recommendations as she accepted lessons had been learned and new measures taken to reduce the risk of similar incidents occuring again .			0
