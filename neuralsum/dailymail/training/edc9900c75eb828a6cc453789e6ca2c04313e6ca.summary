a gene linked to the amount of grey matter in our brains – and therefore our intelligence – has been identified			1
scientists found a variant of the gene was associated with a thinner cerebral cortex – the outer layer of the brain known as grey matter – and that those who had it tended to do less well in verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests			1
previous studies have shown the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory , attention , perceptual awareness , thought , language and consciousness			1
thinking : scientists found a variant of the gene was associated with a thinner cerebral cortex and that those who had it tended to do less well in verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests however , the latest research , led by scientists at @entity32 ’s @entity31 , is the first to identify a genetic connection between intelligence and grey matter			1
it is not known how the study , conducted among nearly 1,600 14 - year - olds , applies to the wider population , but the results were confirmed by looking at the same gene , @entity42 , in mice			0
dr @entity44 , lead author of the study in the journal @entity47 , said the genetic variation was linked to communication between brain cells			1
‘ this may help us understand what happens in certain forms of intellectual impairments , where the ability of the neurons to communicate effectively is compromised			0
' the genetic variation we identified is linked to synaptic plasticity - how neurons communicate			0
she added : ' it 's important to point out that intelligence is influenced by many genetic and environmental factors			1
' the gene we identified only explains a tiny proportion of the differences in intellectual ability , so it 's by no means a ' gene for intelligence			2
' @entity72 layer : previous studies have shown the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory , attention , perceptual awareness , thought , language and consciousness researchers studied more than 54,000 genetic variants possibly involved in brain development			1
it was revealed that teenagers carrying a particular gene variant had a thinner cortex in the left cerebral hemisphere , particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes			1
and they tended to perform less well in tests			0
the genetic variation affects the expression of the @entity42 gene , which encodes a protein that affects how brain cells communicate			2
the team also looked at the @entity42 gene in mouse and human brain cells			2
it was discovered that the @entity42 gene had a different activity in the left and right hemispheres of the brain , which may cause the left hemisphere to be more sensitive to the effects of @entity42 mutations			2
their findings suggest that some differences in intellectual abilities can be caused by the decreased function of the @entity42 gene in parts of the left brain hemisphere			0
the genetic variation identified in this study only accounts for an estimated 0.5 percent of the total variation in intelligence			0
researchers hope that the study , published in @entity47 may help experts understand some of the biological mechanisms behind mental disorders			0
and it is hoped that in future the findings may help us more effectively diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism .			0

thought the *outermost* layer of the brain is connected to intelligence
studies already proves that the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory
research by @entity32 is first to prove link between intelligence and grey matter
