supporters somehow escaped major harm in frightening scenes as a rally car flipped during a race in @entity5			1
up to nine fans – who were sat watching the @entity7 in @entity5 from a wall on a bend – dived for cover as the @entity11 astonishingly flew towards them			1
both the driver @entity12 and his navigator @entity13 came away from the crash unscathed			0
they were released from hospital after precautionary tests			1
the @entity11 , driven by @entity18 , drove round the corner at high speed during the @entity21 in northern @entity5 the spectators realised there was a problem as the car misjudged the corner and mounted a grass verge , hurtling towards them at pace the @entity11 then hit a dip in the grass , catapulting on to its roof , with spectators having not had time to move back from the roadside as the rally car lands on its roof , before flipping back over , it seems that there is no way the spectators will be able to avoid injury the driver of the car , @entity18 , is helpless as his car flips upside down , and heads dangerously towards innocent bystanders miraculously , the car bounces back towards the road , missing the spectators by inches , and nobody is hurt in the crash one spectator was said to have been taken to hospital with shock , while the race itself was stopped immediately on the same day as @entity55 's @entity54 was fighting for his life after the @entity58 @entity57			1

@entity12 appeared to take a corner too quickly on the first afternoon of a three - day event and lost control just 800ft from the end of the track in the @entity68 – one hour north of @entity69			0
the vehicle was captured encroaching on a grass verge , a vantage point of choice for a number of fans			2
they had to take swift decisive action , but the fact that nobody on the wall was injured remains fortuitous in the extreme			0
one woman can be seen attempting to shield herself from the flying debris as the car tumbled back into the middle of the track			0
thankfully , the car missed all spectators , and even the driver and his navigator were unharmed , despite how the car looked after the crash the back of the @entity11 , which was racing in the @entity21 in northern @entity5 , completely caved in during the astonishing crash			2
