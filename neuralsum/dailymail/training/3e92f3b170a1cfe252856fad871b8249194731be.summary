@entity19 , @entity3 's human resources minister - known as ' minister @entity9 ' for his love of the social messaging site - was left acutely embarrassed after the messages appeared on his feed			1
they suggested to his more than two million followers that he was in the throes of a passionate affair with @entity26 , a high profile journalist			1
mr @entity19 , 57 , deleted the tweets , claiming his account had been ' hacked '			1
but his wife , @entity30 , subsequently told two @entity3 newspapers that she had published the private messages between him and ms @entity26			1
@entity19 was left red - faced after the messages appeared on his @entity9 feed suggesting he was having an affair with a @entity14 journalist			1
his wife @entity37 ( pictured right ) later said she had published them one message , which appeared to have been directly sent from ms @entity26 's account , said : ' i love you , @entity19			1
and i go while in love with you , irrevocably , irreversibly , hamesha [ always ]			0
bleeding , but always your @entity45 ' ms @entity26 denied sending the messages and any suggestion that she was in a relationship with mr @entity19			1
she tweeted that she had ' always praised @entity19 openly on twitter			1
wrote an op - ed on him			0
only b / c [ because ] nothing to hide '			0
but mrs @entity30 told @entity3 's @entity54 newspaper that she had published the tweets to show the world how ms @entity26 was ' stalking ' her husband			1
she said : ' our accounts have not been hacked and i have been sending out these tweets			2
i can not tolerate this			0
this is a @entity14 woman who is an @entity66 ( @entity66 ) agent , and she is stalking my husband			0
' and you know how men are			0
he is flattered by the attention			0
' @entity14 journalist @entity26 is at the centre of the controversy she was also quoted by @entity74 as saying that she would seek a divorce after learning that her husband and ms @entity26 had been having a ' rip - roaring affair ' since april , which had left her feeling ' destroyed as a wife and a woman '			1
' i completely stand by my tweets , i 100 per cent stand by that , ' she told the paper			2
' that woman pursued and pursued him			0
. men are stupid anyways ... for all you know she is a @entity14 agent			0
where ’s love , where ’s loyalty in this world ... i am so distraught			0
' mrs @entity30 's claims were strenuously denied by ms @entity26 , who is a columnist for @entity97 's @entity96 newspaper			1
in a statement given to @entity3 's @entity100 channel , she said : ' in her tweets , she has accused me both of stalking him and of having an affair with him			1
how can it be both ? ' it just shows there are wild allegations			0
her tweets to me are so crazy that all i can do is laugh			2
' maybe she took offense to the fact that i have praised him so much			0
but i am very transparent - anything that i have said is on my @entity9 timeline , for the whole world to see			2
' ms @entity26 interviewed mr @entity19 in @entity118 last april , after which she wrote a flattering profile in which she described him as ' strikingly good looking ' with a ' powerful , deep and sensuous ' voice			1
but as controversy grew over the alleged affair today , things took an even more bizarre turn as the @entity126 released a joint statement on @entity128 denying that they are planning to split			0
' we are distressed by the unseemly controversy that has arisen about some unauthorised tweets from our @entity9 accounts , ' the statement said			1
' various distorted accounts of comments allegedly made by @entity37 have appeared in the press			2
it appears that some personal and private comments responding to these unauthorised tweets -- comments that were not intended for publication -- have been misrepresented and led to some erroneous conclusions			2
' we wish to stress that we are happily married and intend to remain that way			0
@entity37 has been ill and hospitalised this week and is seeking to rest			2
we would be grateful if the media respects our privacy			0
