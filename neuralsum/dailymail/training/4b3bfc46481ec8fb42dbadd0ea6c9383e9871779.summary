agent nets more than £ 1m in transfer fees massive wage bill puts club at risk an alarming picture has emerged of the financial chaos at the heart of crisis club @entity8			1
under global adviser @entity11 , millions of pounds of owners venky ’s money has been spent on a succession of disastrous signings			0
@entity11 arrived at @entity14 in june 2012 , and despite his limited understanding of the transfer market , he operated remarkably swiftly to bring in new blood			2
global adviser : @entity11 has overseen the spending at @entity14 as the club prepared for life in the @entity22 after their relegation from the @entity24 last may , @entity11 recommended payments of more than £ 600,000 in agents ’ fees to sign five unknown @entity29 players			1
these are players who , between them , have made just four league starts this season , and three are now on loan at other clubs			2
but it does not end there			0
@entity40 ’s investigation has discovered that @entity8 , who could end up in @entity41 next season , are burdened with a group of 13 players whose combined wages and agents ’ fees will cost the club £ 30million over the length of their contracts			1
@entity51 : age : 23 , starts : 1 , agent fee : £ 135,000 @entity55 : age : 19 , starts 2 , agent fee : £ 150,000 @entity58 : age : 20 , starts : 2 , agent fee : £ 150,000 @entity61 : age 20 , starts : 0 , agent fee : £ 156,000 @entity64 : age : 26 , starts : 0 , agent fee : £ 65,000 this week , @entity66 ’s demanded that @entity11 , along with chief executive @entity67 and operations director @entity68 , plus caretaker manager @entity69 , attend summit talks in @entity71			1
adding to the confusion , last week @entity11 gave @entity67 a letter ordering him to stay at home while the club investigated the former manager @entity76 ’s £ 2million @entity78 claim for compensation			1
@entity76 , one of four managers to serve @entity8 during this insane season at @entity14 , was dismissed after just 57 days			0
however , the club insisted there was ‘ no investigation ’ into @entity67 , even though club officials have confirmed that he received a letter from @entity11			2
they did , however , state that £ 500,000 has been paid to @entity76			2
passage to @entity71 : @entity69 has been summoned for a meeting with the club 's owners rover and out : @entity95 , @entity76 and @entity96 have all left @entity8 this season the payments made to agents by the club , third from bottom in the @entity22 and in danger of a second successive relegation , are staggering			2
one agent received more than £ 1m for acting on behalf of clients @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and loan signing @entity108			1
it ’s a similar story with the signing of the @entity29 unknowns			1
for instance , agent @entity113 was paid £ 135,000 when @entity51 , 23 , was signed from @entity115 on august 31 , 2012			1
@entity51 made just one @entity22 start for @entity8 before he was allowed to move on loan to @entity119 ’s b team in january			0
@entity55 , who started just one game in the league for @entity8 , is also out on loan , at @entity122 in the @entity123 in @entity71			0
@entity113 , whose name appears on the documents lodged with the @entity126 , was paid £ 100,000 in the deal that secured @entity55 from @entity29 side @entity128			1
making the move : @entity105 joined @entity8 from @entity130 in the summer the agent also negotiated a £ 65,000 fee that brought jobbing @entity29 pro @entity133 , a 26 - year - old defender , to @entity8 last summer			1
@entity133 has not made a single appearance for the club			2
@entity113 ’s influence went beyond the @entity29 players			1
he received £ 75,000 in the deal to sign @entity140 goalkeeper @entity139 on loan from @entity142 for a season			2
in other moves , midfielder @entity58 had shown little promise with @entity29 side @entity146 in the @entity147 when he was suddenly signed by @entity8 , netting his agent @entity149 a staggering £ 150,000 commission			1
@entity58 , 20 , has made just two @entity22 starts for @entity8 , the last in a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity151 in september			0
@entity149 pocketed a further £ 133,000 in fees in the deal to bring former @entity155 striker @entity154 , 36 , to @entity14			1
picked up from @entity156 , he has made just seven starts for @entity8 in the @entity22 , without a goal since september			0
although @entity149 has told @entity40 he was simply used as the transfer fixer by @entity11 , he did confirm that he was paid for the deal			2
championship player , @entity24 wages : @entity106 is understood to earn £ 30,000 per week the final piece in @entity11 ’s @entity29 jigsaw was the arrival of midfielder @entity61 , 20 , from @entity166 , for which @entity167 was paid £ 156,000 commission			1
@entity61 has made one seven - minute appearance in the league against @entity172 in august and has since been loaned to a @entity174 side			0
@entity11 , who has seen @entity95 resign as manager before sacking @entity76 and @entity96 this season , also authorised huge wages for players with @entity24 experience			0
agent @entity180 earned £ 1m from the transactions taking @entity105 and @entity106 from @entity130 , the acquisition of @entity183 forward @entity107 , and the loan deal for @entity108 from @entity185			1
@entity105 has made 33 championship appearances and started for the first time in a month in the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity189 on april 1			0
he is on £ 35,000 a week , with @entity106 on £ 30,000 a week			0
injury problems : @entity107 has been out for much of the season after picking up an injury in pre-season best is on a similar amount — he ruptured cruciate ligaments in pre-season and only returned to the first team a month ago			0
on tuesday night , the club officially refused to comment after being made aware of the precise content of the transactions — @entity11 did not return calls			0
@entity40 gave the financial details and the names of the agents to chief executive @entity67 and club secretary @entity206 on tuesday lunchtime			0
