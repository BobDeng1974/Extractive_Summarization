@entity11 , 15 , and @entity12 , 16 , were suspended from school for the rest of the year last month
the two were *accused* of using a gang symbol at school by their assistant principal
both posed in pictures using a symbol for the @entity59 , a @entity60 - based gang , but the two teens say they just meant the number three
the suspension *prompted* outrage in the community , leading the school district to reverse their decision and let the boys back in school
