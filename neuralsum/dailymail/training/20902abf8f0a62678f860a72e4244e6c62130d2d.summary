by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 20:46 est , 25 november 2012 one fisherman landed the catch of his life after he reeled in an enormous bluefin tuna that weighed a whopping 1,000lbs			0
@entity6 , 30 , wrestled with the huge fish for two hours before he pulled it to the surface of the water off the coast of @entity12 in @entity13			1
it was worth the effort and the wait as the fish is expected to sell for £ 20,000 in @entity18 and make 20,000 pieces of sushi			1
what a catch ! @entity6 ( left ) and @entity22 caught this enormous 1000lb blue fin tuna on a fishing trip off @entity13 @entity22 , who was on the fishing trip with @entity26 , said : ‘ we did n’t realise how big it was until it was about 15feet away from the surface			1
‘ it took @entity6 two hours to pull in , and we had started to see the shape of it when the skipper said “ this could be a big fish ”			1
‘ all of a sudden it broke the surface and everyone said “ it ’s a monster ! ” ’ the fish was so huge that the crew was unable to haul it onto the boat and had to tie a rope around it to drag it four miles back to the dock			1
mr @entity22 , 37 , added : ‘ the deck hand made a lasso and tied it around the end of the fish and we dragged it through the water back to the dock			1
’ when the boat arrived back at the dock , the fish was lifted by a crane from the water and onto a forklift truck which carried the giant fish over to a set a scales			1
mr @entity22 , owner of @entity60 in @entity61 said : ‘ we saw 1,000lb come up on screen which was brilliant			0
’ the crew transferred the fish to a fridge and they are planning on selling it in @entity18 where @entity70 bluefin tuna - @entity68 in @entity71 – is frequently made into sushi			1
the pair , who go on fishing trips together , decided to visit @entity13 with the aim of catching a bluefin tuna			2
they went during the commercial season when fish that are usually set free after being caught are taken back to the dock and sold			2
the record for a @entity68 tuna is held by @entity83 who caught a 1,496 - pound specimen off the coast of @entity13 in 1979			1
large and fast : the torpedo - shaped , streamlined body of an @entity70 bluefin tuna is built for speed and endurance the @entity70 bluefin tuna is one of the largest and fastest fish in the world			2
on average , it measures 6.5feet in length and weighs 550lbs , although much larger specimens are not uncommon			0
its torpedo - shaped , streamlined body is built for speed and endurance			2
in appearance , they are metallic blue on top and silver - white on the bottom which helps camouflage them from above and below			0
they are warm - blooded and can survive in cold waters off @entity105 and @entity106 as well as the tropical waters of the @entity108 and the @entity109			0
they migrate and some have been tracked swimming from @entity113 to @entity115 waters several times a year			0
@entity68 meat is considered a delicacy and overfishing has driven their numbers to critically low levels			0
it has been eaten by humans for centuries and today the @entity18 eat 80 per cent of the @entity70 and @entity126 bluefins caught			2
the species is one of the most sought - after by sushi lovers and can sell for up to £ 16 per piece in high - end @entity132 sushi restaurants			1
in the 1970s , demand and prices for large bluefins soared and commercial fishing operations found new ways to catch them			0
as a result , stocks have plummeted and international conservation efforts have led to curbs on commercial takes			0
in november 2010 , the @entity143 voted to cut the bluefin fishing quota in the eastern @entity70 and @entity109 by about 4 per cent , from 13,500 to 12,900 metric tons annually .			0

@entity6 , 30 , wrestled with fish for two hours off coast of @entity13
it was so big the crew had to tie a rope round it and haul it back to port
it is expected to sell for £ 20,000 in @entity18 where it is a sought - after delicacy
