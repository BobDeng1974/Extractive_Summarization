the @entity1 gunman worshiped the devil and had an online page dedicated to @entity4 , a former classmate revealed , as his childhood barber recalls @entity7 never spoke and would stare at the floor every time he had his hair cut			1
@entity7 's worshiping page had the word ' @entity16 ' written in red , @entity14 - style letters against a black background , @entity12 told @entity17 , something which he said was ' weird ' and ' gave him the chills '			1
the @entity20 are trying to piece together his smashed up hard drive to see if his online footprint will reveal any motive for the killing , but they strongly believe he made use of devil - worshiping and suicide sites and boasted of his murder plans on message forums			1
@entity7 's childhood barber @entity30 revealed today that @entity1 stopped bringing her son in for haircuts a few years ago so he thought he had moved away from the area			1
@entity35 was running out : @entity1 was searching for other places to have her son @entity37 educated and traveled all over the world to find something suitable he told @entity41 that @entity37 would never speak or even look at him any time he came in for a cut , which was every six weeks for years			1
' it ’s just weird that i actually touched him			0
i 'd tried to joke with him , ' @entity30 said			0
' he would n’t even look at me			0
he would just be looking down at the tiles the whole time			0
' i wish i would have killed him then			2
or he should have killed himself a long time ago			2
he would have saved us all the trouble			0
' i should have slit and stabbed him by accident			0
it would have been a lot better for those people			0
' cutting @entity7 ’s hair ' was a very long half an hour			1
it was a very uncomfortable situation ' , stylist @entity57 said			0
she said that she never heard his voice even once and that @entity60 , a divorcee , also hardly spoke - only to tell @entity37 what to do as he would not listen to anyone else			0
weird : a former classmate of @entity7 while they were at @entity65 said he had online page worshiping the devil it also emerged today that the chief medical examiner in the massacre is enlisting the help of a geneticist to see if they can find a biological motive behind why the ' troubled genius ' shot dead 20 children and six adults at @entity1 on friday			1
dr h. @entity78 says he wants to know if there is any identifiable disease associated with the behavior of the shooter , especially as @entity85 's syndrome - which @entity37 is thought to have suffered from - is not associated with violent behavior			2
' i ’m exploring with the department of genetics what might be possible , if anything is possible , ' dr @entity87 said			0
' is there any identifiable disease associated with this behavior ? ' he is also awaiting toxicology results			0
@entity7 's mental state is vital as to why he may have committed one of the worst mass shootings in @entity102 history			1
another working theory is that he was angry that his mother was planning to commit him to a psychiatric facility because he was becoming too difficult for her to handle alone			1
given his decision to kill his mother @entity60 while she lay sleeping in her bed at their @entity111 home and then drive to his former elementary school to purposefully kill innocent children , there had to be a strong connection in his mind between his anger and the school			1
@entity60 , 52 , was thought to volunteer at @entity1 , and so the theory extends to the fact that @entity37 felt he loved those children more than she loved him , since she was planning to send him away			1
house of horrors : it is thought that @entity60 was planning a move from their house in @entity129 , pictured , for @entity130 to find a place for @entity37 to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20 - year - old struggling : various family friends have said that she warned that you could never turn your back on @entity37 while he was in your care , explaining why it may have been taking a toll on her prompting for her to look for options a friend told the @entity144 that @entity60 was overwhelmed			1
' it was really hard for her as a single mother			2
it ’s hard enough raising an autistic child , just me and my wife			0
i could n’t imagine doing it alone , ' said @entity152 , 54 , a @entity7 family friend who has an autistic son , @entity153 , 17			1
' i think it ’s important to get the part of the story out — that an unmarried woman was trying to raise an autistic child on her own			0
i think she needed more support			0
' @entity160 quotes a neighborhood figure , whose father works as the pastor of an area church , as saying that the 20 - year - old shooter found out that his mother was in the legal process of having him committed and was upset			1
that news , coupled with his jealousy of the time she allegedly spent with a group of kindergarteners at @entity1 , is thought to have served as the basis of the killing			1
a number of factors are still unconfirmed in the theory , and it appears that they may remain as such for some time			0
records of conservatorship filings , which @entity1 would have needed to make in order to commit her son since he is over 18 - years - old , are sealed by the courts so if any such filings were made they will not be released publicly			1
' @entity7 believed she cared more for the children than she did for him , and the reason he probably thought this ( was the fact that ) she was petitioning for conservatorship and wanted to have him committed , ' @entity191 told @entity160			1
targeted : all but one of the students in this first grade class were killed by gunman @entity7 , prompting the theory that he chose them because his mother worked with that group as a volunteer unanswered questions : it is still unclear what @entity1 's connection was to @entity1 , though it is confirmed that @entity37 attended it as a child one of the biggest questions remaining ever since the shooting was reported on friday was @entity60 's connection to the school which was clearly singled out as a target by @entity37			1
the majority of his shooting was limited to the reception , where he forced his way into the building and killed those standing in his way , and then to a single first grade classroom			2
those children are thought to be the ones that @entity60 grew close with during the last academic year , when they were in kindergarten			2
initial reports immediately after the shooting claimed that @entity60 was a full time or even substitute teacher at the elementary school , though as the chaos of the day slowed , school officials said that she was not on any records of having worked there in any formal capacity			2
that option leaves the possibility open that she volunteered her time with the young children , though school board member @entity238 could not confirm that role when asked by @entity240			1
that was echoed by @entity242 , a former school board member who told the @entity243 : ‘ no one has heard of her			2
teachers do n’t know her			0
’ though the court records will never back up the claim that @entity60 was trying to have her son committed , her actions do lend credence to the idea because she had spent much time over the course of this year traveling to different schools to find a suitable place to send @entity37			2
former babysitters of @entity37 's said that she warned that she could never turn her back on the young boy , meaning that when she went to visit prospective schools , @entity37 was either with her or very aware of the fact that she had gone shopping for his next home			2
in a @entity264 conversation between @entity60 and her former sister - in - law @entity265 , @entity60 revealed that she had wanted to downsize from her $ 1.4million home in @entity129			1
' i am still in the same place but getting to the point where i may want a smaller house			0
i travel a lot , spend time with friends , work with a couple of charities , ' she wrote in one of the messages			0
as a teenager , @entity7 would come in for a haircut about every six weeks without speaking or looking at anyone and always accompanied by his mother , said stylists at a @entity129 salon			1
he stopped coming in a few years ago , and the employees at the salon thought he had moved away , said stylist @entity30			0
adam in the chair : hairstylist @entity57 said @entity37 was difficult to deal with the comments from him and his colleagues were among the first describing how the @entity288 interacted with each other			0
investigators have found no letters or diaries that could explain the attack , one of the deadliest mass shootings in @entity102 history			0
cutting @entity7 's hair ' was a very long half an hour			1
it was a very uncomfortable situation , ' stylist @entity57 said			0
she said that she never heard his voice and that @entity1 also hardly spoke			1
another stylist , @entity301 , echoed their descriptions of the @entity304 and added that @entity1 would give her son directions about what to do and where to go			1
@entity37 would move only ' when his mother told him to , ' @entity30 said			2
' i would say , " @entity37 , come on			0
" he would n't move , ' @entity30 said			0
' and his mother would have to say , " @entity37 , come on , he 's ready			2
" it was like i was invisible			0
' he said @entity37 also would n't move from his chair after his hair was cut until his mother told him to.if a stylist would ask @entity37 a question , @entity30 said , his mother would answer			0
' he would just be looking down at the tiles ... the whole time , ' @entity317 classmates have previously described @entity7 as intelligent but remote , and former high school adviser described him as anxious and shy			1
several people who knew his mother have described her as a devoted parent			0
divorce paperwork released this week showed that @entity1 had the authority to make all decisions regarding @entity37 's upbringing			1
the divorce was finalized in september 2009 , when @entity7 was 17			2
