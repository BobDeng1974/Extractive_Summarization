with fresh allegations of sexual assault seemingly revealed every day , @entity0 defended his silence shortly before taking the stage at a sold - out show in @entity6 friday night			1
' i know people are tired of me not saying anything , but a guy does n't have to answer to innuendos , ' @entity0 told a reporter backstage at the @entity13			1
' people should fact - check			2
people should n't have to go through that and should n't answer to innuendos			1
' he also responded to reports that radio djs had offered a bounty to anyone who disrupted the show			2
' now suppose someone brings a weapon or decided to do more foolishness			0
" @entity0 said that this is " not good for anyone			1
' the @entity42 noted that an upcoming show in @entity44 set for nov. 28 was now cancelled			0
' when you go to a civil rights march or something like that , at least there are meetings and some organization to it and people understand how to behave			0
there may be people coming to the show that do n't know exactly what to do ; there is no organization to it all			0
' ' i know people are tired of me not saying anything , but a guy does n't have to answer to innuendos , ' @entity0 told a reporter backstage at the @entity13 that same day , @entity0 's lawyer , @entity66 , said the accusations had " escalated far past the point of absurdity , " dismissing them as ' fantastical , ' ' unsubstantiated ' and ' uncorroborated			1
' ' when will it end ? ' he asked			0
' it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity0 to stop			1
' and , throughout the audience , his fans agreed			0
@entity0 said his silence was not an admission of guilt but because he should not be forced to answer ' innuendo ' the show friday night in @entity30 , @entity6 , might have seemed destined for disaster for the comedian , enveloped in growing accusations of rape and sexual assault that have derailed his career comeback and crumbled his tour schedule			1
what he got , though , was an adoring audience that laughed so hard they slapped their knees , shouted love at the stage and rose to their feet as he came and went			0
' i think people went in there with him as @entity0 from the tv show , ' said @entity102 , 40 , of @entity30 , ' not the guy they heard about on the news			1
' the 2,000 - seat theater beefed up security and announcements before @entity0 took the stage warned a disturbance was possible — radio hosts had even offered cash and prizes to anyone who made it happen			1
but , in the end , just one protester stood outside , holding a sign that read , ' rape is no joke			0
' the 2,000 - seat theater beefed up security and announcements before @entity0 took the stage warned a disturbance was possible — radio hosts had even offered cash and prizes to anyone who made it happen what remained to be seen was whether the evening marked a turning point for a beloved television father , or simply a momentary reprieve			1
it did nothing to immediately change the fact that @entity0 's projects have been nixed and stalled , performances have been canceled across the country and women continue to come forward accusing him of serious crimes			1
fans seemed to believe @entity0 should be seen as innocent until proven guilty			1
they talked of watching him on tv as a child , and of his albums becoming familiar friends when the moved to unfamiliar , faraway towns			0
they brushed off the accusations , howling at everything he uttered			0
@entity152 's 90 - minute set wandered from a childhood @entity153 to the loss of freedom in marriage to the rocket - speed @entity158 of a piñata - store worker when he took the stage at the @entity13 , they stood and hollered , and he returned a thumbs - up			0
only a smattering of empty seats were seen			0
@entity0 wore cargo pants and a shirt that said ' @entity168 ' and never once ventured in the realm of controversy			1
his 90 - minute set wandered from a childhood @entity153 to the loss of freedom in marriage to the rocket - speed @entity158 of a piñata - store worker			0
he sat for much at the start of the show , then grew increasingly physical , impersonating jujitsu and gymnastics poses , laying on the floor in stocking feet and thrusting a fist upward in a gesture of battling the everyday oppression of living with a wife			0
and when it was over , he said " good night , " walking off as the audience again stood			0
the most impassioned of his fans breathed a sigh of relief			0
@entity191 traveled from @entity192 , @entity193 , for the show , deeming it ' absolutely fantastic ' and grateful no one interrupted			0
some of the women accusing @entity0 are going public again after initially coming forward around 2005 , when @entity199 filed a lawsuit alleging that she was sexually assaulted by him ' i think he will leave with a very positive attitude , ' she said			1
elsewhere , audiences will not have the chance to see @entity0			1
performances in @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 were called off			0
@entity212 , director of @entity213 in @entity214 , @entity211 , said an april appearance was called off because it conflicts with the organization 's mission strengthen the community ' building empathy , furthering education and sharing joy			0
' projects on @entity223 and @entity224 have been canceled , and @entity225 decided not to air reruns of " @entity227			0
" @entity0 's producers said at least 28 other shows remain on his schedule through may 2015			1
@entity231 , who co-founded the @entity232 which produced " @entity227 , " defended @entity0 in a statement to the @entity234			1
' the bill we knew was a brilliant and wonderful collaborator on a show that changed the landscape of television , ' @entity231 and partner @entity235 said in the statement			0
' these recent news reports are beyond our knowledge or comprehension			0
' and , even in a crowd of @entity0 faithful , there was some worry there was more to come			1
' this very well may be @entity0 's last show , ' said @entity252 , 25 , of @entity30			2
the day of his performance , his attorney , @entity66 , dismisses allegations as ' fantastical , ' ' unsubstantiated ' and ' uncorroborated ' some of the women accusing @entity0 are going public again after initially coming forward around 2005 , when @entity199 filed a lawsuit alleging that she was sexually assaulted by him			1
@entity259 , a @entity260 attorney , also said @entity0 tried to sexually assault her in her @entity263 apartment around 1970 , when she was a model and an aspiring actress			1
she said @entity0 gave her two pills that made her almost lose consciousness , took her to her apartment , undressed her and then took his clothes off as she fought off his advances			2
another woman , @entity272 , said @entity0 gave her drug - laced drinks twice in 1969 , forcing her to perform a sex act the first time and raping her the second time			2
she said she told no one about this for decades , and only decided to go public when she read a nov. 13 column in the @entity280 by @entity281 , who alleges she was drugged and raped by @entity0 when she was 17			2
and , offering a familiar narrative , another woman , @entity283 , said she was drugged and raped by @entity0 in 1976			2
the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity			1
these brand new claims about alleged decades - old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous , and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			2
lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day			0
there has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich , powerful men , so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted			2
this situation is an unprecedented example of the media 's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards			2
over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			2
when will it end ? it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity0 to stop .			1

@entity0 calls media prodding result of a ' frat house mentality '
says he should not have to ' answer to innuendos ' despite dozens of women claiming he assaulted them
his attorney , @entity66 , dismisses allegations as ' fantastical , ' ' unsubstantiated ' and ' uncorroborated '
