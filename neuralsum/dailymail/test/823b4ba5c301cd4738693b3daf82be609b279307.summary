@entity0 by @entity1 testosterone does n’t always get a good press			1
everything that ’s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone			1
violence ? it ’s all testosterone ’s fault			1
sexual assault and rape ? just blame testosterone			2
yet , as @entity1 makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it , testosterone is at the heart of human life			1
‘ without our father ’s testosterone , ’ as he writes , ‘ none of us would exist			1
’ it has only one basic function — to enable a male to reproduce , and for that it ’s essential			1
although this is the case and it ’s impossible to think of ‘ maleness ’ without testosterone , it ’s also important for sexual behaviour in women			1
the blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen , the supposedly ‘ female ’ hormone			1
however , it ’s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known			1
all that ’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone , yet as @entity1 explains , testosterone is at the heart of human life it begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body			1
this influence continues immediately after birth			0
that three - month - old baby boy , sweetly smiling at you from his pram , may well have testosterone levels that rival his father ’s			1
we do n’t know why but , starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months , a little boy ’s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts			1
the hormone ’s power then recedes , but returns — and how ! — in puberty			1
post-puberty , testosterone drives the competition for females			2
in the animal world , stags lock antlers , elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn - to - horn			2
even male giraffes , aroused by the hormone ’s influence , flail at one another with their long necks			1
elaborate colourings emerge in some species , designed to emphasise masculinity and attract female attention			0
in guenon monkeys the scrotum turns bright blue			0
they do n’t seem to mind			2
they adopt the habit of sitting with their legs apart to show the female guenons just how big and blue they are			0
we can only be thankful that testosterone ’s effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic			1
adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances			1
entirely unsurprisingly , having sex increases testosterone levels			2
so , too , does talking to an attractive woman and watching pornographic movies			0
winning at sports sends the levels racing upwards			0
just supporting a winning team can have the same effect			0
it works in politics as well			0
a study showed that , during the 2008 u.s. presidential election , @entity124 supporters were pumped full of testosterone			2
levels fell in the supporters of his defeated rival , @entity131			0
testosterone also helps in the @entity133			2
another study , on a @entity135 trading floor , showed that male traders made more money on days on which their morning testosterone levels were higher than usual			2
a challenge is obviously stimulating			0
surgeons facing difficult procedures often find their testosterone levels shooting up			0
one would assume that the theatre of war would have the same effect as the operating theatre , if not more so			0
after all , testosterone is supposed to be the hormone behind violence and aggression			2
in fact , soldiers in the heat of battle can have testosterone levels not much above those of men who have been castrated			0
it ’s the appalling stress that reduces it			0
once they leave the front line , however , the soldiers revert to more normal levels			0
when levels are high , the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them			1
the creation of laws , religion and customs has , to some extent , been shaped by the need to do so			0
in that sense , as @entity1 writes , ‘ testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history ’			1
his own fascination with the ‘ simple but wondrous chemical ’ that is his subject is clear			0
his book does a fine job of conveying that fascination to the rest of us .			0

the male hormone testosterone does n’t always get a good press
all that ’s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to the hormone
yet , as @entity1 explains , testosterone is at the heart of human life
