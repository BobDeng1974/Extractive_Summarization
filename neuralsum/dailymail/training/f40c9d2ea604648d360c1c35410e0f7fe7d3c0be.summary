by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are being investigated by @entity5 over claims they received ‘ sweetheart ’ deals to cut their tax bills			1
the @entity11 is concerned that authorities in @entity13 , the @entity14 and @entity15 gave the companies preferential treatment in breach of @entity20 rules			1
if they are found to have avoided tax , the three multi-national giants could face huge bills covering the past ten years			1
tax probe : customers test @entity26 at the @entity27 at the @entity29 shopping centre in @entity30 , @entity31 last night , experts said the multi-national giants could be hit with ‘ horrendous ’ bills			1
@entity35 , the @entity11 vice president in charge of competition policy said : ‘ in the current context of tight public budgets , it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes			2
’ @entity44 , commissioner for taxation added that ‘ fair tax competition is essential for the integrity of the single market			0
’ the probe marks an escalation of attempts to stamp out tax avoidance by big companies , which has risen up the political agenda in recent years			1
@entity2 and @entity3 are among a number of @entity57 giants accused of avoiding tax for years through elaborate networks of subsidiaries			0
other big names in the spotlight include @entity63 and @entity64			0
the @entity11 ’s intervention comes after a @entity57 senate probe last year revealed @entity2 had sheltered billions of dollars in profits from tax by using ‘ ghost companies ’ registered in @entity70 which were not resident in any country for tax purposes			1
this has allowed it to pay no corporation tax on international sales , including in the @entity77			0
by channelling sales through @entity13 companies the @entity78 found the @entity82 based company paid no corporation tax to any country on £ 18bn in profits made outside the @entity57 between 2009 and 2012			1
@entity3 has also found itself at the centre of a political storm after it emerged it had only paid corporate tax in the @entity77 once in 15 years of trading , despite racking up more than £ 3billion of sales			0
@entity3 told a @entity77 parliamentary investigation in 2012 that it received a tax deal in the @entity14 which allowed it to enjoy a ‘ very low ’ tax rate			2
it caved in to public pressure in december 2012 and agreed to pay £ 20m of corporation tax over two years to the @entity77 government whether or not it reports a profit			0
workers package boxes to be sent to customers in the @entity100 at @entity101 , @entity102 @entity103 , of @entity104 said : ‘ these companies are guilty of blatant tax avoidance that undermines their local competition			1
they could be hit with horrendous fines			0
‘ hopefully this will help create a level level playing field on tax which would be good news for every honest business based in the @entity77			0
’ but an @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ we have received no selective treatment from @entity13 officials			0
@entity2 is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in @entity13			2
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ we comply with all relevant tax rules , laws , and @entity124 guidelines and we ’re studying the @entity11 ’s announcement related to the state aid investigation in the @entity14			1
’ last night they received the backing of business leaders in the @entity77 , with influential lobby group the @entity131 accusing the @entity11 of using its state aid rules as a ‘ political weapon ’ to increase its influence on the tax affairs of @entity20 members			2
@entity137 , trade and @entity140 policy adviser , said : ‘ there is a risk here that the @entity11 is trying to be seen to be doing something about corporate tax compliance by inserting itself into the sovereign tax affairs of individual member states under the cover of concern about state aid infringement			2
’ she added : “ there is a legitimate discussion to be had about tackling perceived tax avoidance , but conflating different debates is not the way to do it			1
the @entity20 must not put politics ahead of economics			0
