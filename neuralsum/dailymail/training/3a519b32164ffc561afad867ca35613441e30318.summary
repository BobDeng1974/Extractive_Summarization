men who wonder how good they are in bed and want to find out if their partner actually faked that orgasm can now find out the truth - all thanks to modern technology			2
applying a device to monitor their performance may sound like something of a passion killer but the makers promise it will improve the wearer 's sexual prowess			2
@entity14 , a @entity16 online retailer of intimate toys , are developing the product which they 've called a ' @entity19 '			2
need help in the bedroom ? a new app can monitor a man 's performance and then tell them what rhythm to stick to ( posed by models ) it states : ' the @entity19 is worn on the male genitalia and once connected to the mobile app via @entity31 or @entity32 , records key statistics and uses vibrations to set a recommended pace			1
' users can track how well they are keeping to the pre-programmable ' training ' sessions through led lights at the top of the tracker			0
when the centre light is lit , the user is hitting peak performance and matching the rhythm set by the training programme			1
too many lights and the user will need to slow down and not enough lights will advise them to pick up the pace			0
' it added that users will be able to use a button on the gadget to adjust the speed of their ' training session ' during their ' workout '			0
once recovered , the men can then embrace their inner geeks by logging on to the free accompanying @entity19 app for a full appraisal of their performance			1
attach before ' working out ' : the device called a ' @entity19 ' lights up and has speed controls they will be able to find out how many calories they burnt between the sheets and their number of thrusts per minute			1
those without inhibitions can ever share and compare their results on social media - although most of your friends and family would probably prefer it if you did n't			1
speaking about the prototype , @entity81 , head buyer for @entity14 said : ' the digital health and quantified - self craze has started to infiltrate all aspects of our lives			0
too much information : the app even allows you to share your results on social media ' our device is a natural fit alongside the influx of these personal health trackers and with the added benefit of improving an individuals sex life , we expect it to be a huge hit when it becomes available			1
' with over half of all couples in the @entity16 using a sex toy , this is a massive market driven by innovation			0
' that 's why we 've invested in developing the next evolution of toys , which we hope will bring joy to millions of couples who want to upgrade their intimacy			0
