a giant hippo turned the tables on a hungry pride of lions when they tried to attack him - by fighting itself out of a tricky situation before chasing the vicious predators away			1
taken by @entity10 photography duo @entity9 and @entity11 , these incredible photos show a group of lionesses stalking a lone hippopotamus on the plains of @entity16 in @entity17			1
but instead of becoming dinner for the pride , the brave hippo fights back and the lions turn on their heels - fearing they might get a taste of their own medicine			2
' it 's amazing that the hippo manage to escape and to rejoin the river			2
' in the photographs , a male lion circles the hippo before two lionesses jump on it and try and bring it down			1
sticky situation : the huge mammal is shepherded into a muddy ditch and looks to be in serious trouble the four lions look to tuck into the beast ( left ) but it somehow fights them off and they flee ( right ) i 've got my eye on you : the hippo stares at a fleeing lionesses after somehow winning the battle pouncing around : one of the predators leaps open - mouthed at the water - dweller as another stalks it they appear to be winning when the hippo is forced into a ditch and four lionesses jump on its back			1
but within a few moments the hippo has bared its teeth and managed to shake the pride off			2
the lions are sent scrambling onto the grasslands and the hippo even starts to chase them away as it snarls victoriously			2
ms @entity90 said : ' we discovered @entity17 in 1982 and every year since we 've returned to photograph @entity93 wildlife			1
victory snarl : the hippopotamus stares right down the lens and snarls after beating the odds leave me alone ! trying to escape the ravenous creatures , the hippo makes a run through the thick mud trapped : it looks as if it might be the end as the big beast is rammed into a tight space with lions bearing down am i bothered ? the hippo looks nonplussed as a lioness makes a grab at it from behind ' @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity17 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are our favourite countries			1
' we regularly accompany travel groups on their voyage of discovery through the wonderful continent of @entity117			0
' it 's characterised by such a wide variety of moods and characters and we share our passion for wildlife and photography along the way			0
' we never go straight up to animals			0
you could disturb them and it could be dangerous			0
stalking its prey : one of the lionesses creeps up on the unsuspecting hippo , hiding in the long grass all smiles : the hippo breaks into a grin as it escapes the brutal battle still with its life ' it 's always the animal which decide : if they come toward us , we just have to check if they are aggressive or not			1
' if they are n't and that they just want to greet us we just wait and stay very quiet			0
' in that case they can be so close so that you ca n't take any pictures			0
' sometimes lions and cheetahs just want to profit of the shade of our car			0
they just lie down along the car and rest ! '			0
