@entity0 appears to have fallen into line with the @entity3 board over the future of @entity5 - if the midfielder works hard enough			1
the 21 - year - old looked to be set for a season on the fringes of the @entity3 ' first - team with @entity0 unconvinced by the attitude of the former @entity13 youngster			1
but co-chairman @entity14 publicly disagreed with @entity0 , insisting the club were keen to tie @entity5 down to a long - term contract			2
‘ i think he ( @entity0 ) said in a press conference , if i read it correctly , he 's not part of his plans for this season			2
i think he said that in @entity33 but we do n't agree with that			0
we would like to sit down and give him a longer contract			0
‘ we do see him as part of the long - term future of the club but we have to agree it with the manager because there 's no point signing a player he 's not going to play			0
’ talent : @entity5 showcased his prestigious talent last season before falling out of favor with boss @entity0 having broken into the first - team at the start of last season , @entity5 's star seemed to be on the rise as he endeared himself to @entity3 fans after scoring a memorable goal in a 3 - 0 win at rivals @entity56			1
but his form waned following a niggling groin injury , which has now been treated with a minor operation , and he ended the season on loan at @entity62 with his future at @entity64 in question			1
but now @entity0 , who saw @entity66 become his fifth summer signing after being granted a work permit on tuesday , has backed the @entity69 international to come good again			1
@entity70 ? @entity0 ( centre ) has questioned @entity5 's attitude in the past but seems to have changed his mind ‘ we thought we 'd brought @entity5 to the forefront of his abilities this time last season , ’ he told @entity74			0
‘ he had a fantastic pre-season and started the season very well			0
that drifted away a bit and he ended up at @entity62 , helping them get promoted			2
‘ if he gets back to knuckling down , and getting used to the discipline side of the game , then his talents are outstanding			0
