a specialist unit is being set up by the @entity2 government to hunt down paedophiles who are using a hidden part of the internet known as the ' dark net ' to share child pornography			1
the @entity8 and the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) will use the latest technology to crackdown on users of the so called dark net , or deep web			1
prime minister @entity15 said the new unit is aimed at ' shining a light on the web ’s darkest corners ' as he announced a package of measures to tackle online child abuse			1
the new unit will use new advances of analysing images and communications to trace the ' digital footprints ' left by the users who share them			2
the dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media			1
most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines , which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea , missing much of the information in the depths			0
the dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods , but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity			2
the @entity69 website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins , the electronic currency			0
other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs , hacked information , credit card numbers and other illegal goods			2
the @entity69 used an underground computer network known as the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users			0
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption , hiding the ip address and the activity of the user			0
just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the @entity2 accesses this hidden part of the internet			0
the @entity8 estimates that around 20,000 people from the @entity2 use secret or encrypted networks each day			2
the dark net consists of a network of encoded websites that sit behind the publicly available websites and can not be found with normal search engines			2
it came to prominence in 2012 when the @entity106 made a series of raids on @entity69 , an online marketplace described as the ' @entity110 for illegal drugs '			0
mr @entity15 said : ' the so - called " dark - net " is increasingly used by paedophiles to view sickening images			2
' i want them to hear loud and clear , we are shining a light on the web ’s darkest corners ; if you are thinking of offending there will be nowhere for you to hide			1
' every time someone chooses to view an online image or a video of a child being abused , they are choosing to participate in a horrific crime			0
' the new unit is intended to focus on the most prolific users of the dark net to begin with			1
figures compiled by the @entity8 suggest that use of the dark net rose by two thirds in 2012			1
hidden capabilities that enable users to email and host file storage through encrypted and anonymous networks are provided by services like the @entity82 ( @entity82 )			0
@entity82 users currently represent 0.18 per cent of the total number of internet uses in the @entity2			0
however , in a recent investigation , @entity9 and the @entity8 were able to track down a @entity2 man who had been maintaining chat rooms and websites in the @entity146 and @entity147 that were used to share child pornography around the world			1
he was also offering advice to other paedophiles about how to hid their behaviour and was using software to keep himself anonymous			0
@entity15 unveiled the new unit to target the dark net at the # @entity158 summit analysis by experts at @entity9 allowed them to trace the man and he was later sentenced to three years in prison for making and distributing indecent images of children			1
mr @entity15 announced the establishment of the joint @entity8 and @entity9 unit at the # @entity158 summit in @entity168 , which brought together delegates from 50 countries and 26 technology firms to discuss how to tackle child abuse online			1
he unveiled new technical solutions that the internet industry will use to support the new special unit			0
@entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 will use the digital fingerprints , or hash values , of thousands of known child sex abuse image to prevent them from being viewed or shared			1
technology companies and law enforcement agencies from 30 countries around world have agreed to work together to tackle online child abuse , which is to be supported by a £ 50 million child protection fund @entity178 has also developed new technology that allows child abuse videos to be identified and blocked and is to work with @entity180 to pilot it			0
@entity177 , @entity178 and @entity193 have also said they will investigate ways of placing restrictions within their browsers to block people from accessing child pornography			1
@entity178 and @entity177 have both also introduced a number of changes to their search functions not only the @entity2 but across the world			0
@entity178 claims to have seen a fivefold reduction in the number of searches for child abuse images since these changes were made			0
however , these changes are thought to be partly responsible for driving much of the trade in child pornography into the dark net .			1
