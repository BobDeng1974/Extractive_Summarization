it provides us with instant answers to almost any question imaginable			0
but our reliance on @entity5 for fact - checking and finding basic information has made us forgetful , say scientists			1
it was also found that many individuals view internet search engines as an extension of their own intelligence , rather than a separate tool			1
as a result they still regard themselves as being clever even when they need the internet to find answers			0
our growing reliance on the internet for fact - checking and other basic information has resulted in growing levels of forgetfulness , according to scientists in a series of tests , researchers found that participants were more likely to recall information if they believed it had been erased from a computer			1
those who thought it was stored were more forgetful , even if explicitly asked to keep the information in mind			0
in another experiment , the @entity38 team asked students to answer trivia questions with or without @entity5 , and then asked them to rate their own intelligence			1
they found those who used the internet had a significantly higher view of their own brain power , even compared with individuals who got the questions right through their own knowledge			0
‘ using @entity5 gives people the sense that the internet has become part of their own cognitive tool set , ’ the @entity38 researchers concluded			1
and rather than sharing information , people are more likely to save it electronically if they want future access to it , rather than relying on someone else ’s memory , the researchers found			2
psychologists @entity61 and @entity63 , wrote in the journal @entity65 : ‘ our work suggests that we treat the internet much like a human transactive memory partner [ a person we share personal details with ]			2
' we off - load memories to “ the cloud ” just as readily as we would to a family member , friend or lover			0
’ ‘ it seems that the propensity for off - loading information to digital sources is so strong that people are often unable to fix details in their own thoughts when in the presence of a cyberbuddy , ’ the researchers added			1
' they said that having the internet ‘ undermines the impulse to ensure that some important facts get inscribed into our biological memory banks ’			2
we are now much worse at remembering facts we know are available online , such as as geographical details the teams also found that many individuals now view @entity5 and other internet search engines as an extension of their own intelligence , rather than a separate tool			1
writing in the journal @entity65 , psychologists @entity61 and @entity63 from @entity38 , warn that individuals who believe their memorable facts are saved online are much worse at remembering them			1
' our work suggests that we treat the internet much like a human transactive memory partner [ a person we share personal details with ]			2
we off - load memories to " the cloud " just as readily as we would to a family member , friend or lover , ' the pair wrote			0
' the internet , in another sense , is also unlike a human transactive memory partner ; it knows more and can produce this information more quickly			0
almost all information today is readily available through a quick internet search			0
it may be that the @entity102 is taking the place not just of other people as external sources of memory but also of our own cognitive faculties			1
' the internet may not only eliminate the need for a partner with whom to share information - it may also undermine the impulse to ensure that some important , just learned facts get inscribed into our biological memory banks			2
we call this the @entity5 effect			1
' in a series of tests , researchers found that participants were more likely to recall information if they believed it had been erased			0
those who thought it was stored on a computer were more forgetful , even if they were explicitly asked to keep the information in mind .			0

people *'s* reliance on the @entity102 has caused growing levels of forgetfulness
many people now see @entity5 as an extension of their intelligence
we are now much worse at remembering facts we know are available online , such as as geographical details
