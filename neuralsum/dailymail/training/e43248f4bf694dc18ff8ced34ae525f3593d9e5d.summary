this is civility and @entity88 democracy			2
demands : @entity90 ( pictured ) , president of the @entity2 lower house of parliament , has called on the government to fully investigate and explain what happened ' but the most serious aspect is that everything took place to the total indifference of the passengers and when i asked for them to be treated more humanely i was told in an arrogant manner to get back to my seat as it was a normal police operation ...			1
