president @entity0 was asked about his ' first wife ' in a pr - disaster interview on thursday after picking three of the most popular @entity5 content creators to interview him			1
@entity6 , a popular @entity5 fixture known for her extreme acts like eating a ladle full of cinnamon , offered the president three samples of her trademark green lipstick as gifts for his daughters – and for the woman she called @entity0 's ' first wife			1
' ' you know something i do n't ? ' @entity0 cracked before @entity21 corrected herself and referred to @entity23 as ' first lady			2
' but the pr disaster that was the @entity26 's 50 - minute - long ' @entity5 interview ' was a national joke before it was half - over			1
another @entity5 star , 19 - year - old @entity27 , asked the leader of the free world , ' if you had any super power , what would it be ? ' @entity0 's answer : the ability to speak to anyone in their native language			1
but @entity67 's green lipstick and @entity0 's ' first wife ' will be what 's remembered			2
the married @entity71 - based video blogger , usually sporting her green lipstick , starts each of her videos with a cheery : ' hello ! this is @entity77 ! is you ok ? is you ? good , ' cause i wanted to know ! ' the @entity26 press corps , accustomed to toiling for a decade or more before ever getting to ask a sitting president a question , was unimpressed when the administration announced the plan to give @entity86 , @entity77 and @entity21 ( no relation ) a cozy afternoon with @entity0 following the annual @entity64 – and a giant platform			1
one @entity90 correspondent asked @entity26 press secretary @entity91 during a daily biefing : ' i 'm just curious – was " @entity93 " or " @entity94 " not available ? ' @entity95 screamed to her fans when she heard that she would be included in the mini-cattle - call that she was ' so happy i watched all those episodes of " @entity99 " ! ' the @entity26 intended for the event to draw a younger audience – @entity102 who get their news from @entity104 and @entity105 – in the hope of bringing public policy down to the level of the personal			2
but it 's unclear who actually watched			0
at its peak , slightly more than 84,000 were viewing the presentation , according to live counts displayed by @entity5			2
the gift : @entity6 offered the president tubes of greenb lipstick for his wife and daughters @entity122 : president @entity0 posed for a selfie with three @entity5 celebrities on thursday after nearly an hour of softball questions low - information voters : a @entity129 official told @entity0 during the broadcast that the most - searched questions during his @entity64 address included those answered in middle - school civics classes the east room : @entity26 staffers decked out a hallowed hall for @entity27 and two other online celebrities ; her set was dressed to look like a teenage girl 's bedroom the substantive questions that made the cut were not shown to @entity0 ahead of time , according to a @entity129 representative who introduced the video segment			1
@entity21 asked whether the items on @entity0 's @entity64 wish - list from tuesday night were pipe dreams			1
' none of them are at all politically feasible			0
am i wrong ? ' he probed			0
@entity0 offered stock talking points to this and other questions about marijuana policy and drone warfare			2
but he did offer the president a commercial for his @entity162 insurance overhaul , asking for an autograph on a photo of himself holding a $ 5 receipt for a monthly prescription order that he said had cost $ 1,100 before he had insurance			0
' that makes me feel good , ' the president said , uncapping a pen			0
' a lot of young people who are your viewers , they do n't have a chronic disease , so they think " why do i need it ? " – until something happens			0
' a bronze - level insurance policy , he claimed , now ' typically costs less than your cell phone bill or your cable bill			0
' @entity6 offered a curt ' i sorry ' to first lady @entity23 for saying she was the president 's ' first wife ' the @entity184 : for seven minutes on @entity5 , @entity95 sat in a bath of milk and cereal while eating it comments : people who showed up to watch @entity0 's interviews with @entity5 stars had some interesting thoughts to share , many of which we ca n't show in full @entity95 took her star turn , before suggesting @entity0 was headed for divorce , to ask him about race relations , gay marriage and @entity201			1
strongman @entity202 ' puts the " dic " in " dictator " , ' she told the president			1
and she said he husband , a retired @entity207 officer , was mad at her because she had cut the hoods off his hoodies			0
she feared for his safety in the wake of racially charged police shootings			0
' it 's not regular folks , ' she told @entity0			2
' it 's the po - po			0
' @entity95 , who made no effort to hide her enthusiasm for @entity0 , counts among her most - watched video a 100 - second short in which she screams , in character , that she loves the president because ' he black ! he black he black he black ! yes , i said it ! ' @entity86 asked about cuber - bullying , the affordability of higher education and the terror group @entity228 – before falling back on questions about @entity0 's super-power wishes , what tv shows he watches and what he wanted to be when he grew up			1
' i do n't follow politics that much , ' she admitted			1
' why should the younger generation be interested in politics ? ' @entity0 , @entity237 : more comments left on @entity5 during the @entity26 's historic interviews the president confirmed he was ' really big on sports ' and often watches football or basketbal while he works out			1
he also said he had ' wanted to be an architect for a really long time ' in his youth			0
she ended the interview by asking him to pose for – what else ? – a selfie			0
as the event wrapped up , one commenter asked : ' is the @entity254 a full time job ? because it sure does n't look like it			0
' @entity26 press secretary @entity91 told reporters aboard @entity259 earlier in the day that the event would involve ' having conversations with particularly popular @entity5 content creators to have a conversation about his @entity64 address			1
' ' and it simply is an effort to try to engage as many @entity102 as possible in a variety of venues to discuss the president 's priorities			0

@entity6 was one of three @entity5 stars granted interviews with @entity0 in a @entity26 that *welcomes* few *journalists* for sit - downs
she 's *famous* for a comedy video where she declares she loves @entity0 because : ' he black ! he black he black he black ! yes , i said it ! '
@entity77 's videos include hot - *pepper* eating , bathing in *breakfast* cereal , and @entity285 *parodies*
she said @entity201 strongman @entity202 ' puts the " dic " in " dictator " '
two other @entity5 ' celebs ' with millions of followers *joined* in with more *mundane* questions , with one admitting ' i do n't follow politics that much '
