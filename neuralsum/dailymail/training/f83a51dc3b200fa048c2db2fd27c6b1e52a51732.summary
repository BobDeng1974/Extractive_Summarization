by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 24 july 2013 @entity2 units will not cope with the surge in patients this winter unless bosses make urgent changes , @entity7 have warned			1
just one in six casualty units has enough consultants working during its busiest hours and most are ‘ relying too heavily ’ on junior doctors			1
a report published today warns of an impending ‘ crisis ’ as more than 100,000 patients now spend at least four hours in @entity2 every month			1
@entity2 : @entity7 are warning that @entity18 bosses must quickly draw up plans on how they will cope with the expected rise in patients this winter it says the launch of the @entity18 helpline made problems worse as unqualified call centre workers sent patients unnecessarily to casualty			1
mps on the health select committee say @entity18 bosses must quickly draw up plans on how they will cope with the expected rise in patients this winter			1
their report revealed how consultants may be absent for the 16 busiest hours of the day – between 8am and midnight – in 83 per cent of casualty departments			1
but to cover gaps in rotas , trusts are spending about £ 500,000 a year on locum doctors who tend not to be as skilled , it said			2
junior doctors do 12 - hour shifts without breaks and many work seven nights in a row ‘ under intense pressure ’ , it added			0
the report comes as the number of emergency cases is soaring			0
a lack of @entity54 out - of - hours services has been blamed for patients increasingly arriving at @entity57 with non-urgent problems			1
a report says the launch of the @entity18 helpline made problems worse as unqualified call centre workers sent patients unnecessarily to @entity2 and @entity65 ’s ageing population has led to rising numbers of elderly people being admitted for long - term treatment			1
winter this year was particularly busy , with many staff reporting departments at breaking point as they dealt with cases of flu , chest infections and the vomiting bug norovirus			0
although summer is usually quieter , the heatwave has triggered a surge of patients suffering from sunstroke , heart problems and allergies			1
dr @entity83 , of the @entity84 , warned that staffing levels ‘ had come to a crisis ’			0
he claimed the methods used to plug rota gaps were ‘ untenable and unsustainable ’			0
@entity90 mp @entity89 , chairman of the health select committee , said : ‘ the system is “ flying blind ” without adequate information about the nature of the demand being placed upon it			0
the committee is mindful of pressures which will build during next winter and is concerned that current plans lack sufficient urgency			0
’ he said he was ‘ not convinced ’ that the plans so far presented to him by @entity18 chiefs , senior gps and ambulance bosses were ‘ adequate ’			1
last winter , many @entity2 departments were reported to be at breaking point as they dealt with cases of flu , chest infections and the vomiting bug norovirus ( picture posed by models ) @entity65 's ageing population means rising numbers of elderly people inevitably require treatment he added : ‘ we think it is extraordinary that consultant coverage for a minimum of 16 hours a day during the working week is guaranteed in only 17 per cent of designated @entity2 departments			1
the figure is even lower at weekends and there are high vacancy rates for senior staff and consultants leading , inevitably , to high locum costs			2
‘ we know that early assessment by a senior clinician can improve outcomes and accelerate a patient ’s progress through hospital , but for this to happen there must be sufficient numbers of senior staff in the emergency department			0
’ mps also said the @entity18 helpline was in the ‘ last chance saloon ’ , although they claimed it has the potential to work			1
hospital watchdog monitor says £ 500million should be spent recruiting 10,000 extra staff including 1,100 consultants , 1,300 junior doctors and 4,000 nurses and midwives			2
dame @entity151 , the chief operating officer of @entity152 , told @entity153 's today programme : ' it 's very disappointing that accident and emergency departments do n't have as much consultant cover as we would all wish them to have			0
' we need to work much harder at making this an attractive profession for young doctors , so we can recruit them			0
' inevitably if you have a situation where you do n't have the best possible resource , then that can compromise making sure patients get the best treatment			2
' we need to do two things about this			0
first and foremost , we need to look at how we can make our accident and emergency departments the very best they can be , which means improving recruitment			0
' but also , we need to make sure that the patients who do n't need to be there and do n't want to be there are n't			2
that 's about tackling issues in general practice , in community services and in social care which will help to keep the patients that we are most concerned about - the vulnerable and the elderly - in their own homes			2
' @entity187 agreed there were ' difficulties ' with the roll - out of the 111 service , adding : ' if certain providers had done what they said that they were going to do and had the call handlers in place to talk to patients , then it would have been fine			2
' but we were able within a very few weeks to get a really great service , and the 111 service is now stable			0

*bungled* launch of @entity18 helpline has made problems worse , mps claim
