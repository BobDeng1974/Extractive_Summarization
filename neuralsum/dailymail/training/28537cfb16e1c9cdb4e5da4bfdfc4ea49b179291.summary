by @entity1 reporter published : 06:43 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 7 december 2013 @entity3 's first - ever sex shop has opened for business after it was given the green light to start trading by @entity7 scholars			1
the @entity10 - based online store - called @entity8 , which means ' cherries ' in @entity13 - went live this week stocking vibrators , candy g - strings and lubricants , amongst other products			1
after obtaining a supporting fatwa from local sheiks , the website 's founder , @entity18 , now hopes to attract customers from across the @entity24 world			1
love is the universal language : @entity8 , @entity3 's first - ever sex shop , based in @entity10 , has opened for business after it was given the green light to start trading by @entity7 scholars he told @entity32 : ' it 's not about just sex			1
it 's about love and the joy of expressing that love			2
' it 's about trying to build bridges across gaps that separate the husband from the wife by improving sexual harmony , which in turn will lead to happier marriages , less divorce and less infidelity			2
' in that sense , it is a social project			0
' according to @entity7 teachings sex is exclusively reserved for married couples , so the unmarried 30 - year - old @entity56 - @entity55 businessman admitted he was a little nervous about asking the sheikhs for their approval			1
but he had two stories up his sleeve which compelled him to start his business , and that he felt sure would win the support of the @entity7 scholars			2
one was of a couple who , on their wedding night , were on the one hand so nervous , and the other so keen , to ' begin [ their ] sexual journey ' that they did n't even think to use foreplay , with the unfortunate result that the bride ended up in hospital with bleeding for three days			0
the second was a tale of a 25 - year - old mother of five who , after being shown how to use a condom with her fingers as an example , went on to have sex with the prophylactic on her hand			1
mr @entity18 says he departed the mosque with the unanimous approval of the sheikhs for his venture			0
contrary to the belief of many non-muslims , the religion 's teachings encourage sexual intimacy within marriage - and not just for procreation			2
islamic law allows women to divorce their husbands on the grounds of a lack of sexual fulfilment and , as mr @entity18 points out , a pronouncement by the @entity103 , the @entity7 prophet , says : ' not one of you should fall upon his wife like an animal ; but let their first be a messenger between you			0
' ' and what is that messenger ? kisses and words , ' added the entrepreneur			0
modest : the store went live this week stocking vibrators , candy g - strings and lubricants , amongst other products			1
its appearance is rather different from the sex shops those of us in the @entity123 may have seen however , befitting the comparatively less wantonly promiscuous nature of @entity7 culture , @entity8 is not like the sex shops those of us in the @entity123 may be used to			1
' pornography and raunchy schematics are not used to sell our products , ' the website says			0
it adds : ' we currently live in a time where love making is cheapened by risqué marketing advertisements			0
that ’s what sets @entity8 apart , in a league of its own			0
' our aim is to provide a range of tasteful products to help rekindle the purity and passion between married couples			2
' @entity8 is proud to help foster healthy relationships and open communication by offering a wide spectrum of marital aids that help husbands and wives achieve and maintain an intimate lifestyle			0

@entity10 - based online shop hopes to attract business across the @entity24 world
it stocks vibrators , edible *underwear* and a range of other *erotic* items
but its appearance is rather more modest than sex shops in the @entity123
