by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 02:53 est , 14 january 2013 @entity1 was last night accused of trying to cover up a donation from a controversial banker who has faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood			0
sir @entity6 – the former @entity7 chairman blamed by shareholders for the bank ’s humiliating £ 21 billion taxpayer bailout – gave £ 10,000 to labour just days after mr @entity1 made a major speech attacking bankers ’ behaviour			1
sir @entity6 paid the money by bidding at a @entity17 fundraising auction for a set of handwritten team talk notes by @entity21 manager sir @entity20			1
the £ 10k donation : former @entity7 chairman sir @entity6 , left , paid £ 10,000 for handwritten team talk notes by @entity21 manager sir @entity20 , pictured right , at a @entity17 fundraising auction the notes , prepared for the 2011 @entity25 against @entity26 , had been secured by @entity28 ’s former spin chief @entity27 , who is a friend of sir @entity20			1
sir @entity6 did not attend the auction in july but used a proxy bidder to buy the lot for £ 10,000			2
the @entity17 recorded the bid in its donations register – but said that it had come from @entity35			0
last night a @entity36 mp called on the @entity37 to investigate whether @entity17 leader mr @entity1 had attempted to cover up sir @entity6 ’s donation			1
under @entity37 rules , all such successful bids have to be included on the public register of donations			0
@entity17 declared the donation – from ‘ @entity44 ’ – on july 25 , two weeks after mr @entity1 had given a speech in which he attacked the behaviour of financiers and pledged ‘ to build banks that serve the people , not just themselves ’			2
investigation : a @entity52 mp has called for the @entity37 to investigate whether @entity1 attempted to ' cover - up the donation ' after it was registered as being from ' @entity44 ' sir @entity6 incurred the wrath of @entity7 shareholders when he agreed to @entity57 ’s request to save the ailing @entity58 ( @entity58 ) by mounting a takeover in september 2008			1
the former prime minister – who made the suggestion at a drinks reception which has subsequently been dubbed ‘ the most expensive cocktail party in history ’ – said that competition rules would be relaxed to allow the deal to be rushed through			0
conservative mp @entity67 has written to the @entity37 over why the donations was ' misregistered ' disastrously , shares in the newly formed @entity70 soon plunged by 90 per cent			2
the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) is now investigating the circumstances behind the merger and is expected to report in the spring			0
last year , activists representing 800,000 @entity7 shareholders joined mps in calling for sir @entity6 to be stripped of his knighthood if he is censured by the @entity71			2
their demands came after @entity79 , the former boss of the @entity80 , saw his knighthood forfeited for his role in the bank ’s near collapse , a move backed by mr @entity1			0
last night @entity52 mp @entity67 said he had written to the @entity37 to ask why the donation had been misregistered			1
in his letter , mr @entity67 says ‘ the public will want to be assured that the @entity17 did not purposefully cover up his donation to avoid negative media coverage ’			0
he told @entity90 : ‘ it beggars belief that @entity17 – whose failure to regulate the banks helped cause the biggest bust ever – are now taking cash from the man who broke @entity7 , leading to a multi- billion - pound taxpayer - funded bank bailout			0
by either reckless incompetence or deliberate misrepresentation labour hid the fact that sir @entity6 gave @entity1 ’s @entity17 thousands of pounds last summer			1
‘ which failed banker will labour be taking money from next – @entity79 ? ’ a source close to sir @entity6 said that the ex-banker had bid for the team talk because he was a keen collector of sporting memorabilia			1
‘ someone bid on his behalf , and the cheque was sent by @entity35 because the bank manages his private trust			0
that is clearly why the mistake happened			0
’ a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ this was an administrative error by the @entity17 which we have already corrected with the @entity37 , ’ adding that it was now recorded as a personal donation by sir @entity6 .			1

former @entity7 chairman sir @entity6 paid £ 10k for @entity21 manager sir @entity20 *'s* team talk notes at @entity17 fundraising auction
@entity1 gave speech *criticising* bankers ' behaviour just days before
