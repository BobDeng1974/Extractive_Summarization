by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 06:56 est , 16 may 2012 a man who fell into deep water but pulled himself to safety died of secondary drowning a few hours later			1
@entity5 , 60 , fell off a friend 's boat as he helped move it at a marina in the @entity10 , @entity11			1
despite getting himself out of the water mr @entity5 , of @entity14 , @entity15 , complained to his wife three hours later that he felt unwell when he returned to his apartment			1
doctors described mr @entity5 's death as an unusual case of secondary drowning			1
water that got into mr @entity5 's lungs led to breathing difficulties which could have been exacerbated by medical issues he already had , television network @entity34 reported			1
medics said the relatively rare phenomenon probably began with his self - rescue			0
it typically occurs when someone almost drowns - with water entering the lungs - but they survive			0
dr @entity47 , associate director of @entity49 's - @entity48 in @entity50 , told @entity52 news : ' conceivably water could be inhaled while one still had the means to pull themselves out , but it would certainly be a rare occurrence as usually panic sets in by then			2
' the water that entered the lungs can start to cause problems rapidly , with an onset ranging from between one and 48 hours			2
rare : in cases of secondary drowning , inhaling salt water - like that found in the @entity10 ( pictured ) - can more more harmful to the lungs than fresh water because problems develop so quickly , there is no known warning signs , which means anyone who has a near - drowning experience should still seek emergency medical advice for potential 24 - hour observation			2
secondary drowning can cause lung damage because water comes into direct contact with the lining cells , impeding functions like supplying oxygen and removing carbon dioxide			0
damage can be especially severe when salt water is inhaled into the lungs			0
according to @entity84 , dr @entity47 added : ' it â€™s conceivable that the drowning episode and lack of oxygen led to a heart problem , like a cardiac arrhythmia or a myocardial infarct ( heart attack )			0
' he added that , with prompt medical attention , secondary drownings would be survivable , now watch the video			0
