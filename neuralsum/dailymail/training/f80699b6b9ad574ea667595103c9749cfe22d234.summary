@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 remains a doubt for friday 's @entity4 match against @entity5 , and centre back @entity6 could also be missing after injury problems			1
@entity0 twisted his left ankle and knee before the @entity1 's opening game against @entity11 and watched from the bench as @entity13 filled in admirably for him in a 2 - 1 win while @entity6 has a tendinitis problem			1
anything but a win for @entity1 in their second @entity20 game would send @entity11 crashing out of the @entity4 , so @entity11 supporters will be praying for the fitness of the legendary @entity23 ' keeper and the @entity1 's first choice centre back			1
getting there : @entity0 trained for @entity1 on thursday but is still suffering from swelling to his injured ankle missing link : @entity28 defender @entity6 could be the latest player that the @entity23 lose to injury coach @entity30 said @entity0 : ' had three great days of training but the ankle is still slightly swollen			2
if he feels good after today 's training he 'll play			0
' @entity6 was held out of training wednesday due to a tendinitis problem that bothered him all season with @entity23 champions @entity37			2
key duo : @entity0 and @entity6 would be a couple of big misses for the @entity23 if they are ruled out by injury able deputy : @entity44 performed well in @entity0 's absence and could be called upon again by @entity30 ' @entity6 is better but we 'll evaluate him tomorrow morning , ' @entity30 said			0
if @entity6 is unable to play , @entity47 could take over in defense alongside @entity49			0
easy does it : @entity0 saves a shot during the session but might not be back in time to face @entity5			0

@entity0 could miss second @entity4 game with ankle still swollen
first choice centre back @entity6 bothered by tendinitis problems
