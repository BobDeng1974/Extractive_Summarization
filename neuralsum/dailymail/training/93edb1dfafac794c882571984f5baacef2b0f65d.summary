a former @entity1 @entity0 and his wife who pretended a freak bicycle accident had blinded their seven - year - old son to swindle £ 70,000 in insurance cash have been jailed			1
@entity6 and @entity7 forged medical documents showing their son had suffered irreversible eye damage in the horror smash and used the money to buy a sports car			1
they were both found guilt of one count of fraud by false representation and two counts of forgery and sentenced to a year in jail each			1
the couple , both aged 38 , were caught out by fraud investigators when they tried the same trick again - this time claiming that mrs @entity7 had been partially deafened when their car backfired			1
former army lance corporal @entity6 , left , and his estranged wife @entity26 , right , were jailed for a year each at @entity27 after swindling £ 70,000 in an insurance scam a judge at @entity27 heard today how the couple dreamed up the scam after their son fell off his bike near the @entity1 base where they lived and was rushed to hospital suffering from head injuries			1
the court heard their vulnerable son - who suffers from @entity38 , autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity40 ) - was probably not aware of the scam his parents were playing out			1
they later submitted a claim to their insurer , @entity45 , saying the optical nerve in the youngster 's left eye had been severed in the accident , leaving him permanently blinded			2
the couple faked a letter from a real - life respected ophthalmologist , stating that their son 's reported blindness was untreatable , which they faxed to @entity45 , the court heard			2
the insurance company then paid out a lump sum of £ 70,000 into their bank accounts two month later			2
@entity62 , prosecuting , said the document was a ' complete forgery in every way			2
' @entity66 , from @entity67 , stood stiffly in the dock with his hands behind his back			1
his estranged wife , whose address was withheld by the court , did not acknowledge him as she entered the courtroom			0
the court heard she was convicted in 1996 for falsely claiming £ 11,000 in benefits over a two year period between 1993 and 1995 , judge @entity77 , the recorder of @entity79 , heard			2
the court heard the couple faked a letter from a real - life respected ophthalmologist , stating that their son 's reported blindness was untreatable , which they faxed to insurance company @entity45 the original accident took place in june 2010 outside the @entity92 army base , in @entity93 , where mr @entity66 was a serving officer and the couple lived at the time			1
their scam unravelled less than two years later after the couple tried the same scam again , alerting insurance investigators to a possible fraud			2
this time they put in a £ 35,000 claim to @entity45 stating that their car had backfired in the garage , leaving mrs @entity7 deaf in her right ear			1
after officers began probing the fraud the former @entity0 applied for voluntary redundancy from the @entity1 , receiving a £ 42,107 payout			1
police immediately seized the cash and will now return it to the defrauded insurers			0
@entity112 , defending @entity66 , said the former @entity0 was a man with ' difficulties			2
' he told the court that the former soldier , who was recently working as a machinist , was ' frightened ' of going to jail because he would not be able to care for his two children , step - children or gravely ill partner of nine months			0
@entity66 , pictured outside court , applied for voluntary redundancy from the @entity1 after the fraud was probed and received a £ 42,107 payout ' when someone has their fingers caught in the till , they do n't put them back in there again , ' mr @entity112 said			1
' he knows he is the author of his own misfortune , he has put himself in this position but those things do frighten him that the door will close shut			0
' it also emerged @entity66 had previously been handed a caution for assaulting his wife in april last year			1
the couple have two other children other than the son they involved in their deceit , a daughter and another son , aged four years			0
defending mrs @entity7 , @entity147 said her husband had ' worn the trousers ' in the relationship and that one of the forged letters to @entity45 had been sent from the guard room at the barracks where he was stationed			1
he said mrs @entity7 ' personal problems were ' significant ' and called on the court to take a ' merciful and lenient course ' after she got a job as a carer , despite suffering from diabetes and angina			2
mr @entity147 appealed to the judge to consider the effect on the family 's three children of jailing both parents , in particular on their eldest son			0
' it has had a very serious effect on him , ' he said			0
' a young man with @entity38 's can have great difficulty computing that and any change to his routine can have real psychological problems			2
' this would not be just a change it would be a complete upheaval			0
' she is trying to hold her family together as best as she can , but of course she has to be punished , ' he acknowledged			0
mr @entity147 said the money had mostly been spent on paying off household bills and debts , saying : ' they were not flash cars or flash holidays or anything of that nature			0
' however the couple 's bank records showed that as well as paying off their debts , they had splashed their windfall on a @entity197 sports saloon			0
detectives brought in to probe the couple 's actions discovered that following their son 's accident they had forged medical letters , claiming to be from doctors at @entity205 , to vastly exaggerate the extent of his injuries			1
the court heard the crudely written letters were littered with factual inaccuracies and grammatical errors			0
when detectives contacted the hospital , they were told that mrs @entity7 had repeatedly failed to take her son to scheduled medical appointments and that , when she had , a specialist had confirmed that the boy was able to see in both eyes			1
sentencing the pair , mr @entity220 said : ' to forge a letter such as that from a consultant in the @entity225 and making such claims is clearly an appalling act - not only just dishonest , certainly devious but many might think despicable			0
' i am satisfied that that was a joint forgery , it is a joint document			0
' i am sure that £ 70,000 to your family at that time made you all as a family , happier and you were able to buy a car and other things			2
' it was not clear whether any money was put aside for [ your son 's ] benefit , or for when he was older			0
[ @entity241 ] is not a part of this , he is someone whose unfortunate accident has led to this crime being committed			0
' @entity247 police detective inspector @entity246 , deputy head of the @entity248 , said : ' @entity6 and @entity249 shamelessly lied to their insurer about their young son 's health to gain tens of thousands of pounds that they were not entitled to			1
' @entity256 on getting a payout they even forged medical documentation to support their spurious stories			1
' their downfall should serve as a lesson to anyone thinking of submitting bogus personal injury claims , off the back of actual or made up incidents , the @entity248 is working with industry to put you before the courts			0
' @entity270 , fraud manager at @entity45 , added : ' today 's sentencing sends out the clear message that those committing fraud are increasingly likely to get caught , prosecuted and found guilty			1
' @entity45 will continue to take a tough stance on tackling insurance fraud			0
customers should not have to pay the price for fraudsters through higher premiums			0
