by @entity0 for the @entity1 apart from golf , perhaps the only other thing all 12 @entity4 players plus their captain @entity5 have in common is a love of football			1
so you can imagine the reaction when sir @entity11 walked into the team room at @entity13 last evening			1
it did n’t matter , of course , that only two of them supported @entity18 ; that rival clubs including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 all had their supporters			1
sir @entity11 meets the @entity4 team ahead of the @entity26 in @entity13 starting on friday the @entity4 team showed togetherness and high spirits as they gathered in a huddle after a photocall @entity31 enjoys a moment to himself in his @entity4 gear ; the @entity34 made his debut in 1997 it 's all fun and games at the first practice round as @entity39 pulls the ears of @entity41 sir @entity11 arrives at @entity13 ahead of giving a motivational speech to the @entity4 team former @entity18 manager @entity11 , a big golfing fan , will seek to get the @entity4 team geed up before friday the former @entity18 manager plays golf during a pre-season tour of @entity48 back in 2012 sir @entity11 , taking part in a charity golf tournament at @entity51 in @entity52 in 2011 @entity41 jokingly gives his friends from the @entity55 team a gesture as he sets up to practice on tuesday @entity41 then has a chuckle to himself and carries on hitting balls after giving the ' friendly ' wave to his rivals how could it not help to swap stories , enjoy a little banter and hear some inspirational words from arguably the greatest @entity66 manager of all time ? ‘ i met him first at the @entity70 in @entity71 15 years ago and when i became captain , for a number of reasons , i asked him , ’ said @entity5 , before they all gathered			1
he loves his golf and there were a number of things that he was particularly good at as a manager where i thought he would be a natural fit			2
' but this is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them			2
’ @entity5 said the conversation with @entity11 would be about having fun , not a headmaster 's preaching @entity90 attended the @entity92 and @entity91 for national coaches in @entity94 last week the @entity96 team pose for team photograph prior to the start of the first practice round @entity4 are looking for their third straight success over @entity55 , having won in 2012 and at @entity102 in 2010 it continues a recent tradition that saw rugby legend @entity105 speak at @entity102 four years ago and @entity23 manager @entity106 say a few words at @entity108			1
‘ there ’s a lot to be gained from hearing different voices from different sports , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ it ’s relaxed and it is a conversation			0
i thought @entity105 was brilliant and i know sir @entity11 will be fantastic with the players			1
’ day two of @entity26 week and big crowds turned up to watch the first official day of practice			2
many of the players got their first look at the fabulous grandstand around the first hole that will be such a feature of the three days of competition			0
@entity5 sent his players out in threes , which might seem a strange way to prepare for fourballs and foursomes but , as ever with this deep thinker , carried logic			0
@entity133 , @entity134 , @entity31 , @entity41 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity4 team captain @entity5 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity39 and @entity141 form the @entity4 team looking for a third straight success @entity4 team captain @entity5 wipes his eyes with the famous @entity26 trophy in his grasp @entity148 taking you through the closing holes at @entity13 ‘ it was so they could play quicker , because i did n’t want them on the course for six - and - a - half hours , as they were at @entity108 , ’ he argued			1
both captains are acutely aware that a lot of players are coming into this contest on the back of a heavy workload of eight tournaments in 10 weeks			0
indeed , @entity55 captain @entity163 said he was concerned that a lot of his players are tired , which seemed a bizarre thing to flag up before the @entity26 had even started			0

‘ they are tired , but you have to deal with it			0
’ @entity5 poked gentle fun at @entity163 and his talk of targeting @entity139			0
‘ i do n’t know how you target someone in golf , you ’d have to ask @entity163 , but i do know @entity218 loves all that sort of talk , ’ he said			0
‘ he loves playing the villain			0
he was the villain for @entity55 at @entity108 and he ’s relishing the chance to play the role again			0
’ @entity55 team members @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 wait patiently on the 15th green @entity23 manager @entity106 and his family pictured at @entity108 for the @entity26 in 2012 ; @entity4 won in a dramatic encounter			1
