@entity1 doping officials are to contact the @entity2 to obtain more information following serious allegations surrounding one of the biggest stars in @entity1 athletics			1
@entity9 lawyers representing the athlete moved into overdrive yesterday to make sure their client is not named , with threats of legal action if the star ’s unblemished reputation was damaged in any way by being linked with known drugs cheats			1
the star @entity1 athlete is named on a list — seen by @entity21 — that details 150 athletes with alleged highly suspicious blood samples from 2006 - 08 that were not followed up with target testing by the @entity2			1
three @entity26 champions are reportedly on the list as well			1
one of @entity1 ’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up the existence of the document — but not the identities — was revealed in an explosive series of three documentaries by @entity39 tv network @entity38 who were greatly helped by a senior whistleblower from within the @entity2 medical and anti-doping commission			1
two other @entity1 are listed but were fringe track - and - field performers , though one was tested before a major competition because of suspicions brought on by ill - advised comments pre-race			2
the well known @entity1 star was contacted by @entity21 and given the opportunity to explain circumstances behind the high blood values that led to their inclusion on a list containing many athletes with doping records			2
a number of them were found out after their blood samples showed suspiciously high concentrations of haemoglobin — a possible sign they were using blood - boosting endurance drug @entity67			2

however , @entity81 recognise the allegations as being in the public interest and their intelligence and operation team will seek talks with the @entity2			0
