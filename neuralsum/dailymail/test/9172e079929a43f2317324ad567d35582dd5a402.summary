as someone who suffers from computer eye strain , i was alarmed to discover that prolonged exposure to gadgets such as iphones and @entity6 can cause irreversible damage to the eyes			0
a @entity10 expert , dr @entity9 , has found the @entity12 screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light - sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness			1
research has already shown that the intense levels of ' blue light ' emitted from modern gadgets can cause a variety of health complaints , ranging from sleeping and eating problems to headaches and even cancer			2
in extreme cases , she says , it may even lead to macular degeneration , which causes dark patches to appear in the centre of the field of vision			0
according to dr @entity9 , modern led screens , produced from about 2007 onwards , emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology			1
this matches my own experience , in which pre- 2007 screens tend not to cause discomfort			0
the average adult now spends up to eight - and - a - half hours in front of a screen every day , and it is not uncommon to be exposed to multiple screens at once			1
for these reasons , says dr @entity9 , who is based at @entity64 in @entity65 , the majority of people are likely to be in the danger zone			1
children and the elderly are most at risk on account of their delicate eyes , as well as ' digital workers ' and those - like me - who are especially sensitive to blue light			1
dr @entity9 ( pictured ) said : ' never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense , for such long periods , from such an early age ' ' never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense , for such long periods , from such an early age , ' she says			1
' people who suffer from eye strain are like the canaries in the mineshaft , as they are aware of the damage being done			0
but it can affect anybody			0
' the damage , she explains , starts when the photoreceptors - types of neurone found in the retina that convert light into information - begin to die out due to the prolonged saturation of blue light			1
this puts strain on other parts of the eye , leading to increasing levels of inflammation , discomfort and pain			0
eventually , the concentration of blue light in the centre of the retina , an area known as the macula , may cause it to be permanently damaged , leading to visual disorders			1
however the problem can be remedied by using special screen filters or glasses designed to block blue light , which are available through opticians			1
@entity122 , clinical adviser at the @entity123 , says : ' it has been proven that intense exposure to blue light kills cells in the retina , and it is a perfectly reasonable possibility that it can cause macular degeneration over a period of time			1
' more research is needed to prove it to the scientific standard			0
we need to conduct studies on a large number of people over a long period of time			0
' but the proposal is of great interest			0
' dr @entity9 carried out experiments at the @entity64 in which human retinal cells , taken from volunteers , were exposed to cycles of led light of different intensities			1
she found that exposure to intense blue light caused apoptosis , or cell death			2
however this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light			2
based on this research , she designed a screen filter called ' @entity159 ' , which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine			2
dr @entity9 found that exposure to intense blue light caused cell death in the eye			1
however this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light her findings prompted her to design a screen filter called ' @entity159 ' , which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine other treatments are also available			1
in 2013 , @entity174 optometrists in @entity175 , who are specialists in the field , tested my eyes using a machine called a @entity181			0
following this , they designed a pair of glasses with a blue tint , which blocked the most harmful part of the colour spectrum			0
the harmful effects of exposure to gadgets is linked to the high levels of ' blue light ' , also known as ' short wavelength light ' , that is emitted by modern screens			2
according to researchers at @entity198 , ' not all colours of light have the same effect '			0
in particular , blue wavelengths , which are emitted by most electronic devices produced from 2007 onwards , have been shown to have ' adverse health effects '			1
modern led screens emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology			2
researchers have found that using an electronic gadget with a backlit display for just two hours can affect the production of melatonin - the chemical that controls our body clock - and cause sleep problems , particularly in teenagers			1
a study at @entity219 's @entity218 revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light stimulated the sensation of hunger , even directly after meals , making it a contributor to weight gain and obesity			0
and experts at the @entity229 found a link between cancer and the use of gadgets that emit blue light in the evenings and by night			2
in addition , dr @entity9 has found that exposure to blue light can damage the retina causing macular degeration , or partial blindness			1
children and young adults are at greater risk , as they lack the natural protection against blue light that the human eye naturally acquires			0
the effects can be reduced by the use of protective filters or spectacles			0
prior to this , i had been unable to use iphones , @entity6 and other gadgets with @entity12 screens without shooting pain in my eyes , dizziness and nausea			1
this condition is known as @entity265 - @entity264 syndrome or ' visual stress '			0
it is thought to be caused by hypersensitivity to particular frequencies of light , whether blue , red or green			0
in response , the visual cortex - the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information - generates too much electrical activity			0
this spills over into different areas of the brain , causing a variety of symptoms			0
about 10 per cent of people with dyslexia are thought to have visual stress			0
it can also be found in those with autism , adhd , migraine , photo - sensitive epilepsy and multiple sclerosis , as well as stroke victims			1
unusually for a sufferer of the condition , i have none of the related conditions listed above			0
when i used the blue glasses , however , i found that my eye pain , dizziness and nausea all but disappeared when using led screens			2
i later discovered the glasses did not work with every type of screen , possibly because some emit different frequencies of harmful light			2
when i road - tested one of dr @entity9 ' filters , i found my symptoms were reduced significantly on all devices , though the blue spectacles were more effective with certain screens			1
dr @entity9 says the use of @entity12 screens has become so ubiquitous in such a short period of time that in 20 years ' time , severe eye problems could become widespread			1
she and her colleagues are lobbying @entity321 , @entity322 and other technology manufacturers to make their screens friendlier to the eye , meaning that no protective filters would be needed			1
this , she says , is an uphill struggle because super-bright screens make more of an impact on the customer , which encourages sales			2
she has also been putting pressure on various @entity335 governments , on both a national and regional level			0
as a result , a number of @entity10 local authorities have ruled that all schools under their jurisdiction must use protective screen filters			1
@entity159 filters are now available online and cost between € 12.95 and € 49 , depending on the size of the screen .			2

key *culprit* is the @entity12 screens found in most electronic devices
these can can harm the light - sensitive retina , irreversibly damaging sight
however the problem can be remedied by using special screen filters
dr @entity9 has developed one to make light less damaging
