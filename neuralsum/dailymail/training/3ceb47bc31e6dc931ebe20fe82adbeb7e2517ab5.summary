but a new letter shows that , when it came to celebrating at least , they were every bit as debauched as their modern - day equivalents			0
penned after the @entity14 celebrations in @entity15 , @entity12 's letter describes how couples were openly having sex outside @entity18 as the @entity19 walked out on to the balcony			1
newsreel footage from the time may show the @entity14 celebrations as refined , but a new letter reveals that couples were openly having sex outside @entity18 as the @entity19 took to the balcony @entity12 , who wrote the letter to her officer husband , also describes how the drunken crowd booed ' boring ' members of the cabinet and instead demanded to see @entity32 @entity15 's streets were turned into a festival ground as revellers poured on to the street to mark the end of the @entity38 in @entity39			1
this picture shows @entity41 @entity12 recorded how drunken crowds along @entity43 booed speeches by boring members of the cabinet before demanding to see @entity32			1
after downing rum and whisky , @entity12 and her friends joined the jubilant throngs to see @entity32 give his famous v for victory salute			1
and in her letter to her army officer husband who was away in @entity39 , she wrote how she ‘ ached ’ for him and that they would have ‘ gone wild and never stopped ’ had he been there			1
mrs @entity12 ’s account of @entity14 is a far cry from the mild , traditional newsreel footage of the event in may 1945			2
it is now coming up for sale at auction in an archive relating to her husband @entity65 , whose father was sir @entity67 , the son of an @entity68 and a former ambassador of @entity70			1
at the end of @entity38 , @entity65 was in @entity72 with the @entity73 , leaving his wife and her friends to celebrate at home in @entity15			1
in her letter , @entity12 describes drinking a bottle of whiskey with friends ( left ) before they had ' quite a good dinner ' and then ' stumbled across f * * * * * g couples to the palace where the @entity19 had just been out ' ( right ) mrs @entity12 wrote how the group went to the @entity86 in @entity87 for dinner on may 8 , 1945 where they had a ‘ set - to ’ with staff about being allowed in			1
she said : ' eventually they let us all have a rum and orange			0
we had quite a good dinner and then stumbled across f * * * * * * g couples in the dark to the @entity18 where the @entity19 had just been out			1
' we decided to go to @entity43 in the hopes of seeing @entity32			2
the crowds were terrific but we managed to make our way behind a string of sailors			0
' @entity103 was a seething mass. we actually all got on to a jeep but thank heaven - it got so bad we could n’t move , as otherwise i should have been killed			0
traffic is brought to a standstill in @entity110 in @entity15 as the statue of @entity112 was boarded up to protect it from the jubilant crowds ( left ) one man enjoys the view from on top of a lamppost in @entity110 as @entity119 celebrated @entity121 's defeat celebrations lasted throughout the day and into the night , but the war continued for another three months ' at that moment ( @entity125 ) @entity124 ( deputy prime minister ) and co appeared on the balcony so we made a dash and got right in front of the crowd and immediately underneath him			1
' we cheered suitably at all points of his ridiculous and boring speech at the same time mentioning we ’d like to see @entity32			2
' mrs @entity12 then said how her friends nearly got into a fight with a man who called @entity32 a ‘ drunk who did n’t give a damn			1
’ she added : ' that got our blood up and when @entity124 had finished ( @entity146 ) @entity145 ( minister for labour and national service ) looking like a revolting gargoyle came to the mike to speak - so we just yelled " we want @entity32 " non-stop			2
' quite a lot of the crowd took it up and he never got a word out and had to retire ! we were terribly pleased with ourselves			0
' in the note @entity12 describes the moment she and her friends jeered one cabinet minister off the balcony of the @entity18 with chants of ' we want @entity32 ' ( left ) , before telling her husband she ' ached ' for him to be there ( right ) with her spirits up , mrs @entity12 described how she returned home alone and midnight			1
she said : ' oh darling , you can imagine how i ached for you to be there , it would have been marvellous			0
' we ’d have gone wild together and never stopped			2
' the letter is being sold by @entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172			0
@entity174 @entity173 said : ' this letter certainly gives a vivid account of what the @entity14 celebrations were like and is in contrast to the traditional news footage from the time			0
' she makes it clear that there were couples openly having sex outside @entity18 without caring who was watching			2
over at last : how the @entity188 covered the @entity14 celebrations both by day and by night let the good times roll : a barmaid prepares barrels of beer for the crowds celebrating @entity14 in @entity15 night - time tryst : a soldier is caught in a searchlight along with a woman during the victory celebrations ' somewhat surprsingly for a refined lady in 1945 , she used very colourful language and behaved in a very raucous manner			0
' giving a speech to thousands of people would have been one of @entity145 ’s greatest moments in his career but it never happened because of this lady and her friends			0
' the @entity211 archive , that also includes letters between the couple describing the state of the war , is being sold tomorrow with a pre-sale estimate of £ 500 .			0
