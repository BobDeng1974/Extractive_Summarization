top obama administration officials continue to consult with disgraced former cia director @entity1 about how to fight the @entity3 terror army , even though he has admitted giving classified material to his biographer and mistress			1
@entity8 press secretary @entity7 admitted to reporters on monday that @entity1 , the architect of president @entity13 's @entity12 ' surge ' operation , is still on speed dial despite reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors			1
' he is , i think , legitimately regarded as an expert , when it comes to the security situation in @entity12 , " @entity7 said during a press briefing			0
' so i think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to , on occasion , consult for him advice			1
' obviously , @entity1 is somebody who served for a number of years in @entity12 , ' the president 's chief spokesman said			2
' he commanded a large number of @entity54 military personnel in that country			0
over that time , he developed strong relationships with some of his @entity12 counterparts and with some of @entity12 's political leaders			0
' @entity12 is one of the two countries – @entity61 is the other – where @entity3 , the self - anointed @entity63 , has managed to run roughshod over government armies and claim territory since the @entity68 administration pulled @entity54 troops out at the end of 2011			2
a retired four - star general , @entity1 ' storied career suffered a major blow from revelations he gave the biographer , @entity41 , eight binders of classified material he had kept improperly			1
documents filed in federal court state that between august 2011 and april 5 , 2013 , @entity1 did ' unlawfully and knowingly ' take classified materials and retain them at ' unauthorized ' locations			1
in one august 2011 taped biographical interview with @entity41 that prosecutors used against @entity1 , he can be heard saying of papers in front of them both : ' they 're really – i mean they are highly classified , some of them			1
they do n’t have [ " top secret " ] on it , but , i mean there ’s " code word " stuff in there			0
' prosecutors say he gave her classified binders , called ' black books , ' which included notes about his discussions with president @entity68			0
he left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography , prosecutors said			0
days later , @entity1 brought the books back to his home in @entity110 , @entity111			0
the @entity112 later seized the materials in a search of @entity1 ' home			0
he later lied to @entity112 agents about providing them to @entity117 and said he never gave her classified material , according to court documents			0
in late august 2011 , he took the books to the home where @entity41 was staying during a week - long trip to @entity124 , according to the documents			1
the 62 - year - old agreed on february 22 to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count that carries a possible sentence of up to a year in prison			1
but he is expected to get two years of probation and a $ 40,000 fine			1
the plea agreement was filed in federal court on march 3			0
@entity1 is expected to be in federal court next on april 27 for a hearing on the deal			2
@entity7 was asked if any special security precautions were being taken because of @entity1 ' legal situation			0
' not that i 'm aware of , ' he replied			0
the federal judge who will sentence @entity1 later this year is not bound by federal prosecutors ' recommendations and could make a decision to send @entity1 to prison			1
by reaching a deal with the government , @entity1 will avoid an embarrassing trial that would detail his relationship with @entity41			1
he stepped down as head of the @entity33 after their affair emerged in november 2012			1
hurt : @entity41 remains married to husband @entity152 , pictured together left in 2012 , while @entity1 is married to wife @entity153 , right , despite the affair that forced him to step down as @entity33 chief in 2012 scandal : the affair was revealed after @entity159 socialite @entity158 , pictured , contacted the @entity112 over threatening emails she had received			1
it emerged that @entity41 had sent the emails @entity1 , a four - star general who served as commander of the @entity163 in @entity12 and @entity164 , resigned from the @entity33 in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing			1
@entity41 , now 42 , met @entity1 , 62 , while she was a graduate student at @entity167 , where she was working on a dissertation about him			1
she wrote his biography , ' @entity170 : the education of general @entity1 ' , which afforded them considerable time together			2
they carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012			1
but the relationship was later uncovered whiled the @entity112 investigated claims that one of @entity1 ' friends , @entity159 socialite @entity158 , was receiving threatening emails			2
the messages were found to have been sent by @entity41 , a married mother - of - two			0
as agents investigated @entity41 's email account , they uncovered the affair and learned the @entity33 director had shared classified information with her			1
@entity1 , who remains married to wife @entity153 , acknowledged the affair as he stepped down			2
in may 2013 , @entity41 , who is also still married , finally issued an apology for the affair			2

' i 'm very blessed			0
blessed with an awesome family , a wonderful community that 's been a great part of my rehabilitation , if you will			0
even when you 've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on			0
' @entity1 was a celebrated general who was credited with helping pull @entity12 from the brink of an all - out civil war			0
president @entity68 turned to him to lead @entity54 forces in @entity164 before moving to him to the @entity33 in 2011 .			2

top obama administration officials are still seeking @entity1 ' advice about @entity216 terrorism even though he has agreed to plead guilty
' i think it makes a lot of sense , ' the @entity8 press secretary said
@entity1 reached a plea deadl , admitting he left *notebooks* containing classified information with his biographer and mistress @entity41
no prison time expected but a $ 40,000 fine and two years probation ; a judge could decide to ignore sentencing recommendations
@entity1 had an affair with @entity41 between late 2011 and summer 2012 , and stepped down from the @entity33 after the relationship became *public*
