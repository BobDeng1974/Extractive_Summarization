the start of this season 's january transfer window has been delayed by 24 hours to open on saturday – so it fits in with @entity4 's wish that it only runs for 31 days			1
clubs have been informed that for 2015 the window will open at the weekend rather than on friday january 2 , as would normally be expected			2
the reason is that the last day of the month , january 31 , falls on a saturday when there is a full fixture list including the potential title decider between @entity11 and @entity12			0
@entity14 's @entity13 , who is set to go on loan to @entity16 , can not join before january 3rd the transfer window opens a day later than would be expected , to fit in with @entity4 's guidelines @entity19 : jan 3rd - feb 2nd @entity20 : jan 2nd - jan 30th @entity21 : jan 3rd - feb 2nd @entity22 : jan 5th - feb 2nd @entity23 : jan 3rd - feb 2nd @entity24 : jan 3rd - feb 2nd @entity25 : jan 1st - jan 31st @entity26 : jan 3rd - feb 2nd @entity27 jan 5th - feb 2nd @entity28 : jan 28th - feb 27th @entity29 : jan 5th - feb 4th @entity30 : jan 3rd - feb 2nd @entity31 : jan 23rd - april 16th @entity32 : jan 19th - feb 16th @entity33 : dec 25th - jan 22nd @entity34 : jan 19th - feb 16th @entity35 : jan 17th - feb 16th @entity36 : jan 31st - march 2nd @entity37 : jan 1st - feb 27th @entity38 : oct 21st - jan 12th with sunday not classified as a business day , that pushes back the close of the window to monday february 2			1
@entity4 have ruled for reasons of fairness and to avoid any major league gaining a competitive advantage , all transfer windows should run for a maximum of 31 days			1
starting on january 2 and running to february 2 would mean the @entity19 transfer window being open for 32 days , hence the later start			1
a @entity52 spokesman confirmed : ' this is about the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) – the system through which all international transfers have to be registered			0
@entity55 can only be open for 31 days in the winter window ( @entity4 rules )			1
' we have decided to align our window with that in mind			0
our rules state that if the final day of a transfer window is a weekend or bank holiday we carry it over to the next working day			2
this time , january 31 is a saturday so we will finish on february 2			0
' if you count back 31 days from february 2 then you get to january 3 so that is when we are starting			1
the @entity70 and @entity71 are doing the same			0
@entity72 actually start a day earlier on january 2			0
' an @entity74 spokesman confirmed said : ' the window will open at midnight going into saturday january 3 , and close at 11pm on monday february 2			1
' total spending by @entity52 clubs last january was £ 135million			0
the record is £ 225m spent in 2011			0
it means that clubs in @entity20 's @entity72 will be able to begin their business earlier than the @entity52 's top teams , although the window shuts three days earlier for the likes of @entity85			2
@entity87 's £ 16million move to @entity88 was the biggest move on last summer 's transfer deadline day @entity92 signing @entity90 and @entity93 re-joining @entity11 were last winter 's biggest deals most top @entity96 leagues , including @entity21 's @entity71 and @entity23 's @entity70 , share the same dates as @entity19 , though some , including @entity22 and @entity27 , will begin later , opening on monday january 5			2
however in @entity25 the window will swing open at midnight on @entity100 , lasting the whole of january , with the @entity74 seemingly unworried by public holidays			1
that is nothing , however , compared with @entity33 , who decided to open their transfer window on christmas day			0
@entity32 keeper @entity107 is among the players tipped for a move to @entity19 during the window the earliest opening window that will still be active in january can be found in @entity38 , where transfers have been possible since mid-october ( as part of their longer period , the equivalent of our summer transfer window ) , while the likes of @entity28 and @entity36 do n't open until the end of the month			1
a full list of when every country 's transfer window is open , from @entity123 to @entity124 , can be found here .			0
