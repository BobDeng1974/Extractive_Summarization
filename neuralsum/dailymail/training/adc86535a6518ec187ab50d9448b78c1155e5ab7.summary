in his @entity1 days , he was a rather substantial figure			2
but as this picture shows , @entity2 is now just two - thirds of the man he used to be – after shedding five stone			1
his secret ? an unconventional diet of apples and @entity9			1
he told yesterday how he now skips breakfast and lunch , runs five miles in 45 minutes almost every day , and has given up alcohol			1
to keep him going , he snacks on apples and downs as many as nine cans of @entity9 – and allows himself one normal meal in the evening			1
in just two years , he has gone from 16st 6lb to 11st 5lb – a transformation that has left many of his former colleagues speculating about whether ‘ @entity28 ’ is ill. transformation : @entity2 looking much lighter pictured this week , right , than he did in 2006 , left the 62 - year - old , who left the @entity1 seven years ago , said : ‘ i found that for me abstinence was much easier to deal with than eating a little			1
it ’s much easier to look forward to my meal in the evening			2
‘ it appears to have no adverse effect on me			2
in my old regime i was much more likely to feel drowsy in the afternoon			2
’ when he was in the @entity1 , @entity2 was most at home with a glass of red wine and a plate of red meat			1
these days it ’s a very different story			2
‘ i had my last drink on december 30			2
i do n’t have a particular date when i ’ll start drinking again , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve also stopped drinking coffee and tea			0
the big downside consequence is that i have become addicted to @entity9			1
i might drink eight or nine of them a day			1
i was pleased to see that the @entity52 , after much deliberation , has decided that they do n’t cause cancer			0
’ he said he took inspiration from @entity55 , the former @entity56 chancellor who shed five stone and then wrote a diet book about his methods			0
@entity2 , who once shared a flat with @entity61 , first adopted the 5:2 diet , which @entity63 has used to get into shape , but later decided a stricter regime was necessary			1
but the speed of @entity2 ’s weight loss worried many colleagues , with some convinced he was supporting assisted dying because he was terminally ill himself			1
for the past few years he has been trying to push through a change in the law to make it easier for terminally ill people to end their lives			1
he admitted that it had been difficult to lose weight while working in the @entity1			0
‘ i was just so fat … i just thought : you ’re about to fall over a cliff			0
there will be no going back			0
you ’ll be fat for ever , ’ he said			0
‘ i felt between 1997 and 2007 that i was the only new @entity79 minister who would drink at lunchtime			0
’ he added : ‘ a lot of people ask if it has changed my personality			0
i do n’t think it has at all			0
’ courtesy of statutelawsociety 's channel grossly overweight , @entity2 was heading down the path to diabetes , coronary heart disease , high blood pressure and stroke			1
so it is absolutely right that he lost all that weight , and that would have been true regardless of the technique that he used			0
it ’s great that he has given up alcohol , and it will be very beneficial to his long - term health			2
however , dieticians would n’t recommend following his eating plan			0
because he is missing breakfast , there is nothing to fuel him all day			1
the old saying that you should breakfast like a king , lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper is still sensible			1
his consumption of @entity9 may be considered excessive			1
there is no solid evidence that this is harmful , although one side - effect of caffeine can be irritability			0
and the regime must take iron will , so there is a danger he might fall off it after a while			0
in order to turn this diet into a life - long commitment , he should approach a professional dietician to tweak the nutrients he is taking in			0
since dinner is his only meal , he needs to ensure he is including all the right vitamins and minerals			2
he needs to include lots of greens as well as oily fish like mackerel			0
he should also try to retrain his palate , because he obviously has a sweet tooth			0
swapping @entity9 for other drinks may help him to overcome this in the long - term .			1

@entity2 has gone from 16st 6lb to 11st 5lb in two years
he drinks no alcohol and does not have breakfast or lunch
he lives off @entity9 and apples until dinner , and runs five miles a day
