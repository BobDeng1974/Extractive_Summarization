the @entity0 may still be on high alert for @entity2 - but that did n't stop @entity4 turning its comedic talents to mocking efforts to control the spread of the disease			2
the show made light of the fiasco over whether to quarantine @entity12 - which ended up in an imagined fistfight between her and @entity15 , the @entity16 governor who implemented the harsh new rules			1
the opening skit on the @entity20 show began with ' governor @entity15 ' , played by @entity21 , trying to explain his compulsory quarantine rules , which were briefly applied to any health workers returning from @entity25			1
@entity2 fist - fight : in the sketch , @entity4 imagined @entity15 going toe - to - toe with quarantine - defying nurse @entity12 when asked whether the measures were ' inhumane ' , @entity21 did n't mince his words			1
he responded : ' with all due respect , you need to shut the hell up			0
she got a tent in a parking lot with her own porta - potty – in @entity16 that ’s a luxury condo			0
' confronted with claims he had backed down after the @entity41 and president @entity42 turned on him , he pugnacious governor - figure went on : ' that ’s a bunch of malarky – our policy has not changed : if you present symptoms you will be quarantined			0
@entity2 ? just kidding ! @entity48 , playing @entity12 , coughed before talking about how she had been handing out candy and visited a ' kissing booth ' - referring to possible methods of spreading the disease ' but if i then get a call from president @entity42 ... ' , he continued , before a meandering anecdote of when he met the president during @entity60			2
the scene later returned to @entity2 , cutting to ' @entity12 ' - played by @entity62 , at her home in @entity64			1
explaining her defiance of voluntary quarantines , she introduced herself as : ' @entity67 with an i as in " i do n’t care if i have @entity2 i ’m riding my damn bike ! " consistent until its not : @entity15 , played by @entity21 , admitted he caved to demands from @entity42 ' i ’ve been doing whatever i feel like , took a dip in a public pool , volunteered at a kissing booth			1
for @entity76 i handed out about 1000 loose @entity77 with my bare hands			0
' when asked whether her actions were ' cavalier ' , she plowed on : ' many people are intimidated by a smart , strong women who has lost her mind ! ' i stood up to @entity2 , i ’m not going to be scared off by a governor who looks like a cartoon on a pizza box			0
' at the mention of his name , @entity21 's @entity15 appeared miraculously			2
when asked how he got from @entity89 to @entity64 in seconds , he brushed of the inconsistency , saying : ' i ’m @entity15 , i ’m everywhere ! ' a brief war of words then devolved into a fistfight between the political heavyweight and incorrigible nurse .			0

@entity21 took on guide of @entity16 head @entity15 in sketch
