by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 26 april 2012 @entity2 police have dealt another devastating blow to the parents of @entity5 by refusing to reopen the investigation into her disappearance , claiming there is no new evidence			1
but only yesterday , @entity11 said there were 195 potential leads in the case and declared the missing child ' could still be alive '			1
just hours before the @entity2 announcement , @entity16 and @entity17 spoke of their hopes for a fresh examination of the case by @entity2 officials			1
@entity5 as she looked aged three ( left ) , and how @entity11 envision her now at the age of nine this morning , the couple 's spokesman @entity26 said : ' @entity16 and @entity17 welcome this and they are hugely encouraged by what the police have been doing all of this last year since the launch of the investigative review			1
' they ( @entity11 ) believe that it is quite possible that @entity36 could still be alive and that is what @entity16 and @entity17 have said throughout the five years and they are hugely encouraged by all of this momentum in the case			1
' he added that like the @entity46 police , @entity43 and mrs @entity44 want the case to be reopened but it is ' up to the @entity2 authorities '			1
but their hopes were dashed just hours later when @entity51 do @entity52 , deputy head of the criminal police department , said : ' there are no new elements at the moment that would allow for the reopening of the inquiry			2
' detectives in @entity2 were thought to be keen to re-open the case , despite needed judicial approval via the courts			1
the announcement is the latest in a series of blows to the @entity66 from @entity2 authorities ever since @entity68 vanished five years ago			1
shortly afterwards , both parents were wrongly named as suspects and questioned by @entity2 police			1
then , four years ago , the official inquiry into her disappearance was shelved			2
her parents repeatedly called on officials to resume the search for @entity68 , who vanished just days before her fourth birthday in 2007			2
yesterday , the family released an image of how @entity68 could look now aged nine			0
speaking on the age - advanced picture of @entity36 , mr @entity26 said : ' they are very pleased that the new age - progressed image of @entity36 aged nine was put out yesterday , which is getting wide publicity today			0
' of course , that is the girl that people should still be looking for			0
' we need to remind people around the world that this is probably what @entity36 looks like today , not the very famous picture of her when she went missing			0
this is @entity36 as a young girl now			0
' @entity16 particularly feels there is a very strong family resemblance			0
she sees @entity36 , @entity98 and @entity99 her brother and sister , and herself in the image			0
' yesterday , the detective leading the @entity104 review said the case could still be solved			0
detective chief inspector @entity106 said he believed her disappearance was a stranger abduction , as he said there were 195 ' investigative opportunities '			2
but police refused to say what evidence they had uncovered to suggest @entity36 was alive			1
mr @entity106 confirmed that his team of more than 30 officers involved in the case had been to @entity2 seven times , including a visit to the family ’s holiday flat in @entity120			1
it will be five years next week since the three - year - old went missing as her parents dined with friends nearby			0
the investigative review was launched last year after a meeting between former @entity104 commissioner sir @entity127 and the @entity128			0
five years of uncertainty : @entity36 's parents , @entity16 and @entity17 , still hope for their daughter 's rescue the @entity133 for @entity134 and @entity135 released these projections of how @entity68 might look aged six and nine is she alive ? there have been no confirmed sightings of @entity5 since she disappeared on may 3 , 2007			2
the original @entity2 police team believed she died in a ‘ tragic accident ’			1
@entity16 and @entity17 have always insisted there is no evidence to suggest she is dead , and @entity46 police now believe ‘ there is a possibility she is alive ’			1
where is she ? there have been reported sightings all round the world , ranging from the credible to bizarre psychic visions			0
of those investigated , none have been confirmed as @entity36			0
who is responsible ? three people were officially named as arguidos , or suspects , in the investigation - @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity46 expat @entity159			0
all three were formally cleared when the investigation was shelved and have won libel cases against newspapers and broadcasters which falsely claimed they were involved in @entity36 ’s disappearance			0
the @entity66 believe @entity36 was taken by an abductor			1
convicted paedophile @entity165 allegedly said he saw the girl twice before she vanished and claimed she was stolen to order by a gypsy gang , but denied he was involved			0
are there new leads ? @entity46 police have identified almost 200 new lines of investigation from the @entity2 case files and the @entity66 ’ own private detectives			1
they have refused to reveal details			0
why was this not done before ? @entity2 officers were convinced @entity36 was dead and have admitted publicly that they did not fully investigate other theories , including many of the sightings			2
what else was missed ? police did not set up effective searches and did not alert the @entity185 border for 12 hours , allowing a potential abductor to escape with @entity187			2
even a basic check of the other guests at the @entity191 resort in @entity120 was not completed for 48 hours , by which time many potential witnesses had left			0
what about forensic evidence ? police did not seal off the @entity66 ’ apartment until 10am the next day , by which time the @entity66 , their friends , resort staff , concerned helpers and police officers had all potentially contaminated forensic evidence			1
samples were taken and tested for blood and dna but were found to be so degraded and contaminated that the results were inconclusive			0
will the case be solved ? @entity46 police want the case reopened but public opinion in @entity2 has not been supportive of the @entity66 and there may be little interest in raking over a five - year mystery which has already damaged the country ’s tourist industry			1
even if the case is reopened , the reality remains that blunders in the first few days after @entity36 ’s disappearance may mean the @entity66 will never know what happened to their daughter .			2

@entity2 police say there is ' no new evidence ' in devastating blow to @entity66
@entity11 say they have 195 new leads and add : ' we *genuinely* believe there is a possibility that she is alive '
