to the untrained eye , @entity0 seemed to have played incredibly well			1
he was slick in possession , exciting and unpredictable			0
he went past defenders and he created @entity5 ’s second goal for @entity6			1
so , it was a surprise when @entity8 picked his performance apart			2
‘ he lost the ball an awful lot of times , ’ said the manager			0
‘ if he ’s going to be the player we want him to be , he has to make better decisions when he turns with the ball			0
‘ that ’s not a criticism , but there were other performances out there who merited your obsession more than @entity0			2
@entity26 and @entity27 were outstanding , @entity28 in the middle of the park , @entity6 scored a magnificent goal			1
there always seems to be an enormous obsession with one player			0
i will be prepared to start any of the players in any game , but i ’m not prepared to address the obsession with @entity0			1
’ dazzling : @entity0 was brilliant in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity39 , but @entity8 wants him to improve assist : @entity0 's brilliant run set up @entity6 's second goal @entity8 seemingly has a determination to be contrary			1
on a night when @entity5 supporters arrived at the @entity47 in @entity48 looking for signs of encouragement , the young @entity45 midfielder surely provided some			1
the reaction from the boss seemed a harsh and prickly , like @entity53 trying to dilute the clamour for @entity55 in the build - up to @entity57 98			0
@entity0 was starting his first @entity5 game and seemed to cope well for a 20 - year - old preparing for his first major tournament			1
he left the stadium without a word , head down , flicking through messages on his phone , some of them surely from home in @entity67 , with their thoughts on the post-match comments of @entity8			2
perhaps it was part of a misguided defence mechanism to protect @entity73 , who had worked hard on the left wing and scored his first @entity5 goal since october			1
in front : @entity6 lashed a powerful shot into the corner after a driving run by the @entity45 youngster effortless : @entity0 , 20 , was in complete control and comfortable in his first @entity5 start perhaps @entity8 feared it would fuel a campaign to start @entity0 ahead of @entity73 against @entity86 in @entity87 on saturday week if he appeared excited by the attacking qualities of the young @entity45 midfielder , rather than seizing upon his errors			1
perhaps he wanted to keep him grounded			0
perhaps he really does believe @entity0 is far too casual in possession , picked the wrong options , and that this was the reason his team were so painfully vulnerable at the back			2
whatever the motive , @entity0 can feel miffed			2
his pass completion rate was 91 per cent and he seemed to settle easily into the sleepy tempo of football in the tropical humidity			0
he injected a burst of pace when necessary and was willing to turn and take on defenders			0
his assist for @entity5 ’s second goal was uplifting as he drifted left to right and nutmegged one defender , lured others towards him and rolled in @entity6			1
he may not have always picked the right option , but here he did			0
worry : @entity26 was forced into an early exit after picking up a knee injury make way ? @entity8 might consider swapping @entity73 for @entity0 in the opener against @entity86 elsewhere , he offered a first - time pass or a well - balanced change of direction			1
he showed the poise and vision to open spaces for others and combined well with @entity6 , exactly the sort of thing you would demand of your creator - in - chief			2
until he tired in the final 20 minutes , @entity0 made things happen			2
so did @entity26 until struck down by the injury which may end his hopes of @entity129 participation			0
@entity8 has always had a fondness for the @entity131 , having made him a surprise selection for @entity133 and stood by him through a serious knee injury last year and when a groin problem niggled away in april and may			0
like @entity0 he can go past his man , although just as the deep midfielders did not shield their centre halves well , @entity26 did little to help @entity139 , who found it hard to adjust to his role at right back			0
slight criticism : @entity8 said there were certain things @entity0 could do to improve there was little protection on display full stop			1
@entity148 and @entity28 , another desperate to stay fit and who limped off with cramp , are strong on the ball and prepared to tackle but do not naturally sense danger			0
they were unable to smother @entity39 ’s movement around the edge of the box , but they shifted the ball quickly and @entity5 flexed well on the turnover of possession , especially when they funnelled through @entity0			1
to the untrained eye , that ’s how it seemed : vulnerable at the back , encouraging going forward and @entity0 was a delight to watch .			0

@entity45 midfielder was brilliant for @entity5 in @entity39
his mazy *dribble* set up @entity6 's second goal
@entity0 , 20 , appeared quite at home in his first start for the @entity5
@entity8 may ponder dropping @entity73 in his *favour*
