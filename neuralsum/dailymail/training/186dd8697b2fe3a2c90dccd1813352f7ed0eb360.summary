for just £ 6 , a hacker can create a covert device that tracks everything you type on a keyboard including usernames , credit card details and banking passwords			1
the device , called @entity9 , was built by a @entity11 - based security researcher and works with a range of wireless keyboards			1
once connected , the small usb wall charger remotely decrypts , logs and sends keystrokes to a hacker using specially designed software			1
all of these strokes are then decrypted , logged and sent to a hacker over the web @entity9 was built by hardware hacker @entity29 using an @entity32 board , usb charger and @entity35 wireless keyboard			1
these keyboards use a specific chip that runs on a frequency known as @entity40 protocol , which is how the communicate wirelessly			0
as keystrokes are typed on wireless keyboards , they are typically encrypted as they move from the keyboard to computer			1
by determining which chip a keyboard uses , mr @entity29 can figure out how to decrypt these keys			0

once set up , the charger is plugged into the wall and ‘ sniffs ’ , or ‘ listens ’ to all the keys the user types			1
these keys are decrypted , logged and sent back to a hacker over the web , remotely , using mr @entity29 ’s @entity9 software			1
the technology can be configured to record everything , and even send a text to the hacker if a certain combination of keys is pressed			2

the technology can be configured to record everything , and even send a text alert to the hacker if a certain combination of keys is pressed			2
for example , if the user types the url for an online banking site , or enters a 16 - digit number , which suggests it could be a credit card number			1
and even if @entity9 is unplugged , an internal battery will keep it running - although the battery life depends on the battery used			0
the range of the @entity9 is said to be on par with a standard bluetooth device , at around 32ft ( 10 metres )			0
mr @entity29 used @entity35 keyboards , in particular , because they use the same protocol encryption , meaning once he had decrypted one , he could decrypt others			2
in theory though , this process could be applied to any wireless keyboard			0
mr @entity29 has released the source code and instructions for building a @entity9 , but advises against people doing so without an electrical background			0
last year , @entity114 researchers created keylogging software that can steal keystrokes from computers even when they 're not connected to the web , using so - called ' air gaps			0
' the logged , decrypted keystrokes are sent to a hacker remotely using the @entity9 software ( pictured )			1
the technology can be configured to record everything , and even send a text alert to the hacker if a certain combination of keys is pressed , such as the web address for online banking or a credit card number @entity29 ( pictured bottom right ) has released instructions ( video grab pictured ) for building a @entity9 , but advises against people doing so without an electrical background			1
mr @entity29 used @entity35 keyboards ( pictured top ) as an example because they use the same protocol and encryption an air - gap or air wall is a network security measure			2
it was designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks , such as the internet or a local area network			0
the researchers from @entity114 designed computer software that logs keystrokes , and this software transmits these strokes via @entity156 radio signals generated by the computer 's graphics card			2
the data is picked up by a nearby mobile , equipped to pick up radio signals			0
in the example case , the researchers used a @entity164 and had to plug in the headphones to get the radio receiver to work			0
this can be done without being detected by the user , but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place			0
since @entity156 radio signals can travel over long distances , the receiver could be placed in another building .			0

*keysweeper* device was created by security researcher @entity29
the covert device looks , and works , like a typical usb wall charger
it ‘ sniffs ’ and logs keystrokes made on nearby wireless keyboards
device sends these decrypted , logged keystrokes to a hacker remotely
it can even alert a hacker by text *message* if a certain combination of keys is typed , such as web address for online banking or a credit card number
