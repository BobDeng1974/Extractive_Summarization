by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:00 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 00:03 est , 27 february 2013 a former @entity3 legislator with a staunch anti-gun stance bagged the @entity6 nomination tuesday night in the race to replace shamed ex- @entity9 rep. @entity8 @entity10 will move forward in the race for @entity8 ’s 2nd @entity12 against @entity14 @entity13 in the april elections			1
the @entity6 candidate won in large part because of @entity20 mayor @entity19 ’s super pac , which gave her more than $ 2million for the race			1
the gun debate played a vital role in the nomination , the first since december ’s fatal shootings at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
the super pac ads were against her @entity6 adversary , @entity36 , who unlike ms @entity10 is against banning assault weapons			1
the nomination means ms @entity10 is a shoo in for the april 9 general election , likely sending her to @entity53 , because the @entity44 - area district is overwhelmingly @entity6			1
ms @entity10 defended the financial support from mr @entity19 , saying : ' no one complains when the @entity57 was spending big money			1
' in her victory speech she vowed to fight for gun control until ' gun violence is no longer a nightly feature on the evening news			1
' former @entity6 @entity9 rep. @entity36 casts her vote in @entity65 , @entity3 tuesday ; she lost to @entity10 @entity66 , also a @entity67 , casts his vote in @entity44 today ms @entity36 conceded tuesday evening , saying the outside money certainly played a roll			1
' it shows , unfortunately , you ca n't go up against that big money			0
... that 's the problem with super pacs , ' ms @entity36 , who unsuccessfully challenged @entity8 in a primary last year , told the @entity75 ' there is nothing i could have done differently			1
' following the election results , mr @entity19 expressed happiness of the success on @entity82 : ‘ tonight ’s results are the latest sign that voters across the country demand change from their representatives , ' he wrote			2
but not everyone was so happy with the @entity20 mayor ’s involvement			1
ms @entity36 had warned that @entity93 would try to ‘ buy seats ’ across the region			0
another @entity6 front runner , @entity66 , also took issue with the ads , saying people were ' extremely upset ' that someone from @entity20 was trying to tell people in @entity3 how to vote			1
' that 's what money gets you , ' he told the @entity75 after conceding late tuesday			0
' we earned every vote			0
' guns were a leading issue at candidate forums and email blasts from candidates , even as @entity8 's legal saga played out in court and frustrated voters who 've seen two other congressmen in the office leave under an ethical or legal cloud			2
@entity8 resigned in november , after a months - long medical leave for treatment of bipolar disorder and other issues , then pleaded guilty earlier this month to charges that accused him of misspending $ 750,000 in campaign money on lavish personal items , including a @entity127 watch and fur coats			1
when asked whether his hospitalization for bi-polar disorder impacted his ability to comprehend the charges against him , @entity8 responded , ' i fully understand the consequences of my actions			2
' judge @entity136 said he did n't know what sentence he would give @entity8 , but noted that he can go beyond the five - year maximum rev. @entity8 , issued a statement monday asking for prayers for his son , his daughter - in - law and their children @entity8 pleaded guilty earlier this month to misusing $ 750,000 of campaign funds and acknowledged the charges against him , including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud and and making false statements			1

judge @entity136 said he did n't know what sentence he would give @entity8 , but noted that he can go beyond the five - year maximum			2
' i 'm not bound by the sentencing guidelines , ' @entity136 said			0
' the sentencing guidelines are advisory , and they are something i am bound to consider			0
' when asked whether his hospitalization for bi-polar disorder impacted his ability to comprehend the charges against him , @entity8 responded , ' i fully understand the consequences of my actions			0
' @entity8 , 47 , has already been ordered to pay a judgement of $ 750,000 and surrender some of the goods he purchased			2
@entity8 's spending included $ 43,350 on a gold - plated men 's @entity127 watch and $ 9,587.64 on children 's furniture among the items he bought with campaign funds were a $ 43,450 gold - plated @entity127 watch , $ 22,700 on @entity161 items , - including $ 4,600 for a ' @entity161 fedora - $ 10,105 in @entity157 memorabilia and $ 11,130 in @entity159 memorabilia			1
@entity8 's wife , @entity195 , a former @entity44 alderman , is facing a separate felony charge of filing false tax returns for six years			2
she is also planning to plead guilty and she faces up to $ 250,000 in fines and up to three years in prison			0
but @entity195 will likely avoid prison time and instead get probation , consider the couple has two young children , ages nine and 12			0
@entity8 's father , the famed civil rights leader rev. @entity8 , issued a statement monday asking for prayers for his son , his daughter - in - law and their children			2
he noted that @entity8 suffers severe mood swings associated with bipolar disorder and that his mental health is further strained by the ' press knocking at his door			0
' ' @entity8 remains under tight medical supervision , ' the reverend said of his son			0
' he is struggling with the highs and lows of his bipolar disorder			0
' ' please pray for him , @entity195 and their children , ' @entity222 added			0
@entity8 ( left ) raises the hand of his father rev. @entity8 after introducing him at the @entity227 @entity8 's defense will likely try to use his mental health disorder to lessen his sentence			1
@entity8 entered @entity231 in 1995 and resigned last november due to the federal investigation into his use of campaign funds			2
in a statement last week , @entity8 apologized to his friends and family for his ' errors in judgement			0
' ' over the course of my life , i have come to realize that none of us are immune from our share of shortcomings and human frailties , ' he said			0
