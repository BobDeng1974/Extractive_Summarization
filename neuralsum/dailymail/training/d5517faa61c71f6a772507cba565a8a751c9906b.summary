by @entity0 published : 16:33 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 16:33 est , 1 may 2013 the other day i was playing with my three - year - old daughter , @entity2			1
she ’s obsessed with the story of @entity4 and keeps sticking a mirror in front of my face and inquiring : ‘ who is the fairest of them all ? ’ the answer must always , of course , be her			2
i once ventured away from this party line and dared to say : ‘ dolly , your beauty is true , but @entity16 ’s face is quite nice , too			2
’ and she looked at me , utterly horrified , and said : ‘ no it ’s not			2
your eyes are wonky and your nose has a big bump on it			2
’ she was right , of course			2
children are nothing if not honest			1
but here ’s the thing			2
i still pulled her to me — this wonderfully zany little girl who constantly tells me she loves me to the moon and back — and i felt so happy my heart could burst			2
a perfect life : @entity0 with her children ( from left ) @entity2 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , wonders if things would have been different if she was born beautiful so what if i have a face that might crack a mirror ? why on earth would i care ? i may be somewhat lacking in the looks department , but i am happier and more successful than most women i know			1
i was reminded of this rather satisfying fact this week when actress @entity47 , who won huge acclaim for her role as @entity50 in the brilliant @entity52 drama , @entity53 , admitted she felt fortunate she was not a ‘ conventional ’ beauty			1
she went on to say that there are fewer parts available for prettier actresses — suggesting she attributes her well - deserved success to the fact that she is n’t a looker			1
it ’s a searingly honest thing to say and i , for one , whole - heartedly agree — not with the fact @entity47 is ugly ( actually , i think she has a rather lovely face ) , but that being plain can often play hugely to a woman ’s advantage			1
i have written before about coming to terms with the fact i ’ll never be beautiful			2
it has taken me years to accept that , unlike my fellow @entity69 writer @entity68 , men never fall over themselves to open doors for me or , indeed , proffer free bottles of champagne on aeroplanes			1
but , cruel fate that it is , i have four amazing children — and @entity68 , like so many other attractive women , yearns to have a baby			1
i ’m sure , given the choice of a pretty face or a warm bundle in her arms and a face like mine , she ’d go for the latter			2
who is better off ? @entity0 believes childless , self - confessed ' most beautiful woman in the world ' @entity68 , right , would swap her face for a baby of course , i ’m not suggesting that any woman can help how they look or , indeed , should suffer because of it			1
but in an age when so much emphasis is placed on physical perfection , it ’s a relief when someone like @entity47 admits that being plain can be a blessing for a woman			1
because i firmly believe that ’s how it has worked out for me			2
indeed , i am convinced that if i had been blessed with the looks of @entity106 , life would n’t have panned out in quite the wonderful way it has			2
today , i look in the mirror and while the reflection staring back at me is unremarkable , looking this way has given me the strength , determination and force of character to get out there and prove myself in other ways			1
and prove myself i have			0
compare my story with that of my two close friends from school — both stunning girls whom i spent years feeling desperately inadequate standing next to			1
i used to be convinced they were guaranteed a glittering future , with the promise of a handsome husband , children and whatever else they wanted the world to conjure up before the altar of their exquisite beauty			1
' one kind reader even suggested that next time i have something published i might be a little more public - spirited and place a bag over my head			0
do i care ? ' we hooked up recently at a reunion			0
they have both kept their looks — indeed it was still hard , a quarter of a century on , to quash that same feeling of inferiority when they walked into the room			0
but a few glasses of wine later , it materialised that one remains single , having never found a man to meet her exacting standards , and the other did get married — to someone equally gorgeous — but he turned out to be gay and left her for a man			1
i ’m not being smug when i say they oohed and aahed over photographs of my four children — @entity38 , @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity2			1
well , maybe i am a little bit			0
but they were doing absolutely nothing to disguise the fact that , in their opinion , my life was pretty near perfect			0
and , actually , i could n’t help but agree			0
the reason for this is simple			0
once i accepted what my limitations were on the looks front , i then set about making up for them in other ways			0
unlike prettier girls i knew , i did n’t make my prospective boyfriends jump through a series of inexplicable hoops before deciding to date them			1
if they wanted to take me to an all - you - can - eat @entity178 buffet instead of a fancy @entity180 restaurant then — hey — who was i to complain ? bring on the chicken wings ! if one boyfriend turned out to have an unfortunately hairy back , i did n’t — as one girlfriend admitted to doing — dump him instantly with a shudder of disgust			0
i simply felt relieved that the pressure was off to shave my own legs every single day			0
happy with her looks : actress @entity47 said being plain has its advantages when i eventually met @entity194 at the age of 22 , i felt unbelievably grateful that he was interested in me			1
i did n’t think there was a more interesting , good - looking or richer man out there — i was just relieved that any man at all wanted to hang out with a woman who looked like me			0
so what that he did n’t always know the right thing to say at social occasions or choose the appropriate attire for a family wedding ? i fell in love with him because of his personality — and he , because of mine			1
i can remember sensing from certain quarters — friends and , indeed , my own parents — a feeling that i could do better			1
well , guess what ? those friends are still single , my parents are now divorced and 14 years on @entity194 and i remain soulmates			1
but , for me , the benefits of being plain have n’t stopped there			1
over the past couple of years i have been photographed frequently to accompany features i have written			0
it ’s not my choice — it ’s simply part of the job			0
but what has surprised me has been the extreme reaction from complete strangers who seem to feel the urge to constantly comment on how cross-eyed and ugly i am			1
they could , instead , remark on my writing ability or disagree with my opinion			0
the fact that they do n’t only leaves me to assume that i am pretty good at my job — hooray ! admittedly , i ’ve had to develop a fairly thick skin			0
it can be a little unsettling to be constantly told that my photograph is putting people off their breakfast			0
one kind reader even suggested that next time i have something published i might be a little more public - spirited and place a bag over my head			0
do i care ? well , the tv offers keep flooding in and i ’m still being commissioned , which just goes to show that @entity251 was right — the only thing worse than being talked about is , well , not being talked about			0
and thanks to my looks there does n’t seem to be any real danger of that happening any time @entity258 is also something quite liberating — having hit my early 40s — about no longer fretting over my appearance			0
i ’m not husband - hunting or looking for a date			1
the only people who see me every day are my family , the postman and other mothers			0
none of them care if i am made up to the nines or wearing kitten heels			0
quite simply , i do n’t feel the need to validate my worth as a woman by turning heads in the street or being complimented on my face			0
all i need to do is take a long look at my career , my family and the many positive letters i receive from other people who feel supported through what i write			0
being a plain @entity282 has made my life a dream .			2

our writer agrees with @entity47 that being plain can be an advantage
@entity0 points out she has four children while prettier friends have none
being ' ugly ' has given her determination and strength of character
she *'s* happily married as she and husband went for personality , not looks
