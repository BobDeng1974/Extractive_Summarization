from a personal point of view it 's important to use that frustration to spur you on that little bit more			0

@entity50 talks to the media at @entity1 's @entity53 training base on monday @entity0 made the first of his 23 test appearances against the @entity6 and they left a lasting impression , but the loosehead refuses to be cowed by them or any of the @entity60 heavyweights			1
' the 2012 tour was a baptism of fire for some of us			0
physicality is part and parcel of their culture , ' @entity0 said			2

@entity83 wing @entity81 celebrates scoring a try as @entity6 are beaten in @entity85 on saturday ' they 've set the standard over the years and are continuing to do so , but i 'd like to think we 've got a squad now who can stand toe - to - toe with them			1
' it 's about having the belief that we 're not just capable of hanging in there , but can ramp it up ourselves at the right time and take them to some darker places			2
' head coach @entity101 insists confidence remains intact despite a run of four consecutive losses , albeit each of them to @entity108 's reigning world champions			1
' i do n't think self - belief has been dented in that we 're going in the wrong direction , but losing has made it important to produce that 100 per cent performance , ' @entity101 said .			2
