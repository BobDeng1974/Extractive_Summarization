ms @entity9 , who ran a gym in @entity43 before turning her hand to design said : ' we only have our static park home here on the farm so it would be impossible for people to stay			2
' but when the courses are on for more than one day it is often good for those doing them to spend longer on the farm so they get the feel for it			0
' @entity10 used to own a milk float and even went to work in one			2
the couple paid £ 500 for the vehicle when they bought it from a milkman in @entity32 before beginning renovations with the help of committed friends , the couple were able to complete work on the float over five weekends a lounge in the cab area is one of the b&b 's more luxurious features			1
the couple spent £ 1,051 working on the float ' this gave us the idea , so we tried to get hold of that one but we were n't able to so we got this one instead			1
' we managed to do all the work over just five weekends , it was a really crazy time but we had lots of friends who pitched in			0
' i fought with @entity10 to have a loo and he wanted a shower so we worked out a way to attach both to the back			2
' there is a sink under the bed which folds up			0
in the cab there are seats and the steering wheel is still there and all the buttons			0
' that is my favourite bit - being able to sit in the cab with a cup of tea			0

ms @entity9 's favourite feature of the vehicle is the cab where ' you can have a cup of tea ' ( right ) ' in total it has cost us £ 1,051.09 to refit it and it will be only be available during the summer months			1
' it is kind of like glamping as the sides around the bed is a canopy which can be rolled down			0
' we will provide the breakfast which will be produce from the farm as much as possible			0
' it is just something really different , i never imagined i would be doing this			0
i 'm quite proud that we own the world 's first , and only milk float b&b			2
' it will stay in the field where the alpacas are as it does n't have a motor and hopefully make people feel like they are away from it all			0
