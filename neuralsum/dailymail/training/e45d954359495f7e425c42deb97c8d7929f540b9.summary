the pressure on beleaguered @entity2 boss @entity1 has increased further after an influential local newspaper called for his immediate sacking			1
the @entity6 have risked punishment by @entity2 for their stance but pulled no punches by demanding the club axe the 45 - year - old @entity11			1
under a piece titled ' @entity6 says : @entity1 must go ! ' , the paper makes its outspoken stance after the club dropped into the @entity17 relegation zone following their latest dismal defeat			1
the @entity6 has called for @entity1 's sacking with this hard - hitting message ' @entity2 is a proud and noble name in @entity24 football , ' it says			1
' it is an historic club at the heart of our community , a founding father of the beautiful game			0
' but this great club is now on its knees and the @entity34 is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen			0
' today the @entity6 makes one simple , stark request to the @entity2 board : sack the manager			1
' tuesday 's 2 - 0 loss at fellow relegation - battlers @entity39 leaves @entity2 third bottom of the table and many of their fans are demanding change			1
@entity1 with @entity48 during @entity2 's latest defeat , a 2 - 0 reverse at @entity39 on tuesday @entity51 ( right ) shows the strain during the @entity39 defeat as the club dropped into the relegation zone @entity57 's strike in saturday 's defeat against @entity59 was @entity2 's first goal in exactly 11 hours of football			1
since @entity62 , @entity2 have not won in eight games and are easily in the worst form of any top - flight club			1
' we do not say this lightly , nor do we take any pleasure in saying that @entity1 should go , ' continues the @entity6 , who then claim that he is not the man to save the club from relegation			1
that would be a ' disaster financially , and one from which @entity2 may never recover			1
' @entity1 is also accused of being responsible for ' poor , and too often dull , performances ' and ' awful football , declining attendances , and post-match excuses that beggar belief '			2
@entity2 supporters unveiled a ' @entity1 out ' banner at the @entity84 with feeling mounting against the boss ' @entity2 must act now - before it ’s too late , ' the piece urges before concluding : ' enough is enough			1
' meanwhile , former @entity2 striker @entity89 has also put the boot into @entity1			1
' ( @entity2 ) have got all the hallmarks of a team that is going down , ' @entity89 told @entity93			2
' @entity1 comes out every week and says , " we played quite well today "			2
that might be the case , but they are not winning football matches , and they do n’t look like winning football matches			0
' i really worry for my old club			0
i am not one for seeing people lose their jobs , but sometimes change is necessary			0
' @entity1 is a great lad , but it just has n’t worked for him at @entity2			1
' @entity2 is a proud and noble name in @entity24 football			2
it is an historic club at the heart of our community , a founding father of the beautiful game			0
but this great club is now on its knees and the @entity34 is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen			0
today the @entity6 makes one simple , stark request to the @entity2 board : sack the manager			1
@entity1 is not the man to save this club from relegation and the long - term damage that disaster will bring			1
we do not say this lightly , nor do we take any pleasure in saying that @entity1 should go			2
the @entity6 has been as patient as many of the claret and blue fans , standing by and hoping things will improve			2
despite the results , despite the performances			0
but time is now up			0
no progress has been made under @entity1			2
in fact , this once mighty club is now staring relegation in the face			0
a relegation that would cost the club a lucrative share of the new £ 2 billion @entity144 and @entity145 television deal			0
dropping down a division would be a disaster financially , and one from which @entity2 may never recover			2
as custodian of the club , @entity149 must ensure it does n’t happen			0
@entity1 has presided over just two @entity17 victories in 20 matches since agreeing a bumper new four - year deal in mid-september			1
the poor , and too often dull , performances mean the team is last on @entity158 nearly every week - and at this rate destined for an even later saturday night slot on the @entity161 show next season			0
that ’s why @entity2 must act now - before it ’s too late			1
awful football , declining attendances , and post-match excuses that beggar belief			0
@entity2 should not be aiming to survive - they should be aiming to strive , to compete in the higher reaches of the league			1
long - ball football has been replaced by an equally unsuccessful possession - based style of play			0
now the manager says his side must play ugly football to get themselves clear of relegation - and they will , he says			2
we do n’t believe @entity1 anymore			0
he is out of ideas , there is nothing left for him to say to his players that he has n’t said already			0
we respect his integrity and loyalty , but the fans do n’t want him			0

@entity1 is under fire *due* to @entity2 's *abysmal* form
@entity2 dropped into the relegation zone after defeat by @entity39
@entity2 also recently endured an 11 - hour goal *drought*
@entity6 has called for @entity2 to axe their @entity202 boss
' enough is enough ' , insist the @entity6
