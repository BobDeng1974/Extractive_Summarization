by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:30 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:42 est , 27 december 2013 the makers of @entity4 claim that of 500 women who drank it before every meal , 70 per cent lost a stone or more in six weeks it sounds too good to be true			1
a diet drink which claims to help people lose up to a stone in weight by mimicking the actions of a gastric band is to go on sale in @entity19			2
the makers of @entity4 say it works by expanding in the stomach to convince the drinker that he or she is full			1
they claim it can help overweight people lower their cholesterol , absorb fats more efficiently and reduce their chance of developing diabetes			0
the drink contains l - carnitine , an amino acid which helps burn fat in the body and turn it into energy , and glucomannan , a natural ‘ super-fibre ’ derived from the tuberous roots of the konjac plant			1
when glucomannan comes into contact with water in the intestine it increases in volume , becoming almost gel - like , causing food to move more slowly through the digestive system			0
this , in turn , helps control levels of sugar in the bloodstream			0
the makers say that of 500 women who drank the supplement before each meal , around 70 per cent lost a stone or more in weight within six weeks			1
even women who simply took the drink , without dieting or completing any exercise , lost up to 3lbs a @entity62 & @entity64 director @entity63 said : ‘ the combination of ingredients suppresses appetite and mimics the effects of a gastric band , without undergoing the trauma of invasive surgery			1
’ however experts are sceptical about the benefits of natural foods and supplements that claim to speed up weight loss , with many studies claiming over-the - counter drinks and shakes produce no more weight loss than a placebo			2
but one recent survey found that , on average , volunteers given 4g of glucomannan a day for five weeks recorded a 5.1 per cent reduction in body weight , as well as a 5.54 per cent drop in their body mass index and 14 per cent drop in cholesterol			2
l - caratine in the drink expands the stomach , making the drinker feel full , similar to a gastric band ( pictured ) by contrast , slimmers offered a dummy drug or placebo reported drops in weight of just 1.93 per cent , a 1.97 per cent fall in @entity103 and 12 per cent drop in cholesterol			1
the drinks , which come in fruit - flavoured sachets , cost around £ 1.38 each or £ 28.95 for 21			0
slimmers are advised to drink one with water 30 minutes before every meal			2
they will be sold at boots from next month			0
last month scientists revealed they had developed an implant containing genetically engineered cells which could replace the need for gastric band surgery			0
it responds to fat in the bloodstream by producing a hormone signal that tells the brain : ‘ you ’re full , stop eating ’ .			0

@entity4 is a new *health* drink containing amino acid l - caratine
the acid makes the stomach expand so the drinker feel full
makers claim that 70 per cent of women drinking it before every meal lost a stone or more in six weeks
