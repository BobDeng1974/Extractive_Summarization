residents who one year ago fought vainly to stop flooding destroying their homes have finally returned to @entity2 to rebuild their lives , as seen in this remarkable series of pictures illustrating their recovery			1
in january and february last year , residents abandoned their homes after record rainfall saw rivers burst their banks following years of insufficient dredging			1
more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated with quickly rising waters and entire villages were cut off in the wettest january since records began in 1766			1
now , 12 months on , many of the families caught up in the devastation have moved back into their homes			2
for many , it comes after painstaking and tiring battles with insurers and builders			0
a number of measures have also been taken to ensure the tragedy is not repeated , including the dredging of the @entity28 and @entity29 , to remove 130,000 cubic meters of silt			0
and builder @entity31 was fined £ 1,000 after becoming the first person in @entity34 to be convicted of opening a sluice gate - after he was found to have opened sluice gates to protect his own property at the height of the floods , sending 45,000 cubic metres of water rushing towards local village @entity41			2
though prosecutors said it could not be confirmed whether @entity31 ’s actions had directly caused damage to properties in @entity41 , he was accused of exacerbating the plight of villagers			0

more than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were in a similar position after quickly rising waters inundated entire villages it is only after a year of battles with insurers and builders that many relieved residents are finally able to move back into their homes			1

the 63 - year - old said : ' we ’re back into our house and it is looking good			2
it ’s taken us time , we moved back in pretty much a year to to the day we left ' last year 's flooding , which was the worst on record for the region , meant mr @entity62 needed a boat to travel through his backyard ( left )			1
despite the devastation , he considers himself fortunate			0
he said : ' the affect it has had on people is absolutely catastrophic			0
some people have lost absolutely everything			0
this will affect some of the local people for a very long time , a very long time indeed			0

it 's thought the flooding was due , in part , due to years of insufficient dredging of the local rivers a number of measures have been taken since to ensure the tragedy is not repeated , including the dredging of the @entity28 and @entity29 to remove 130,000 cubic meters of silt			0
