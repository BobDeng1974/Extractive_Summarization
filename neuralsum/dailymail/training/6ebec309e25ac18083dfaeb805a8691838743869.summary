frustrated callers also found that a helpline was constantly engaged , with no queuing system or call back service			1
experts last night claimed bosses had wildly underestimated demand for the bonds despite months of planning , while furious pensioners branded the launch a ' shambles '			1

despite the problems , savers had taken out some £ 270million worth of bonds in 26,000 separate transactions by 3.30pm yesterday			0
but the figures suggest that if demand remains steady the bonds could sell out within five weeks			2
if pensioners continue to deposit an average of about £ 10,400 each , then about one million of @entity69 's 11 million over- 65s would benefit from the bonds before they run out			1
@entity71 , founder of @entity72 , said as few as 500,000 savers would be able to get their hands on the bonds if everyone used their maximum allowance			0
@entity78 , of @entity79 , said : ' this bond is going to be gone in days if not sooner			0
