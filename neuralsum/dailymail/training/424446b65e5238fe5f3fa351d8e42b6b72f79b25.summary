killed in action : lieutenant @entity8 , 26 , from the @entity20 , the @entity21 the 26 - year - old , who served with the 1st @entity23 , was fatally wounded during a patrol when more than 50 armed @entity5 fighters surrounded his men in a 360 - degree ambush			1
the terrifying drama and chaos of the battle is seen in graphic detail			2
the film shows the exhausted 7 @entity34 soldiers carrying lt @entity8 back to their base – a mud - walled fort - as insurgents ’ bullets whistle around them			1
realising time was slipping away , @entity40 , then 24 , lifted ‘ the boss ’ onto his shoulders and dashed across an exposed bridge to the safety of the base			1
he was later awarded a @entity46 for bravery			2
as lt @entity8 lays bleeding on the battlefield , he can be heard telling his men : ‘ i ’m going down … i ’m going down			2
’ desperately fighting to keep him alive , the guardsmen reply : ‘ no you ’re not , sir … stay with us , sir … stay f * * * * * * with us			2
’ their anger and increasing frustration can be heard as they struggle to get a signal on their poorly - functioning @entity56 radios			1
the communications breakdown meant a helicopter to evacuate the severely injured officer was delayed by more than an hour			1
traumatised troops describe how a better radio with a stronger signal could not be used because they did not have vital spare parts to repair the equipment in the fort , @entity66 , in a @entity5 stronghold			1
‘ i have a lack of radios , water , food and medical equipment , ’ he wrote			1
‘ injuries will be sustained which i will not be able to treat , and deaths could occur which could have been stopped			1
we are walking on a tightrope			2
’ a bullet had severed an artery in lt @entity8 ’s right shoulder on may 9 , 2009			2
he was flown to @entity98 in @entity99 but he was brain dead			2

mrs @entity106 , a clinical psychologist , said : ‘ programmes like @entity123 are important even if i find them very upsetting			2
they show the grittiness , the hands - on aspects of the war , exactly what is going on			2
there is still very hard fighting in @entity131			2
’ ‘ i hope the public will get a sense of how humane the soldiers are			1
of how decent they are			0
‘ i hope people will see what the soldiers are up against – out there , fighting			1
‘ i want any claims the @entity141 might have for proper equipment to be supported			1
the more awareness the better			0
’ describing the first time she saw the images , she said : ‘ the footage somehow seemed more horrible than anything i had imagined			1
that patrol base just seemed more brutish … alien			0
‘ his platoon watched it together			0
they were relieved because they could see that they had done everything right – that their contribution had been almost textbook stuff			0
’ mrs @entity106 will watch the whole programme , called @entity34 , when it is aired on monday			0
lt @entity8 was a physically fit young man with a bright future ahead of him lt @entity8 shown puffing on what may have been a victory cigar she said : ‘ i will see it			0
i will force myself to see it			0
no , that is not incredible strength			0
it is just doing one ’s job , what @entity8 would have wanted			0
‘ he would n’t have wanted me to do nothing else with my life			0
he would have wanted me to get on with it			0
‘ so i must deal with these things			0
and psychologists believe that the best way to deal with trauma is to deal with it – not sweep it under the carpet			0
‘ i stay in touch with other mother ’s who have lost sons			1
we are all the same when it happens , all just as mad			0
‘ your head knows what has happened , but your heart says he is still there , that he has just gone abroad on holiday ; that when the doorbell rings , it ’s him			0
’ mrs @entity106 , who has set up the @entity197 , offering grants to help young people develop through facing challenging activities , has become close to the soldiers of @entity202			1
lt @entity8 's diary reveals the shocking equipment issues facing the @entity141 she said : ‘ i have become very fond of them			1
when they got back from @entity131 , they rang me up , one by one , to talk about it			0
‘ there has always been an understanding : @entity8 ’s death rests heavy on them , and it rests heavy on me			0
‘ there has always been that shared something , the sharing of pain			0
‘ i have no doubt that the soldiers loved @entity8 , just as @entity8 loved the soldiers			1
that is a huge comfort			0
’ she is also unhappy with the kit shortages suffered by @entity3 troops			1
mrs @entity106 said : ‘ at the time of @entity8 ’s death , there was bureaucratic waste , while the soldiers in the field did n’t seem to have the basic kit they needed			1
’ asked whether her son ’s death was ‘ worth it ’ , mrs @entity106 said : ‘ i do n’t know yet			0
that will only become clearer over the years , when we can see the fuller picture			0
‘ it would be lovely for me and all mother who have lost sons to see the benefit			1
but in war , it ca n’t always work out that way			0
’ * our war is on @entity18 tonight ( monday ) at 9pm watch the trailer here			0
