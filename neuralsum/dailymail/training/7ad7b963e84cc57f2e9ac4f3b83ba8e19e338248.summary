by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 17:27 est , 6 january 2014 nurses could face checks every three years to prove that they still care about their patients			1
they may be made to undergo regular assessments which would hinge on the feedback of patients and their relatives			0
@entity10 managers would collect up to 20 detailed comments from patients , family members and staff about the attitude of individual nurses and their level of compassion			2
the comments would be sent to the @entity20 – along with assessments on overall ability – and those who fall short could be struck off			1
facing checks ? file picture of medical staff at @entity27 , @entity28 the watchdog is considering the checks in the wake of the @entity32 scandal where some staff were said to have become ' immune to the sound of pain '			1
last summer two senior nurses working in the hospital 's @entity38 department were struck off after being accused of conspiring to fiddle figures on waiting times			2
@entity42 , 48 , and @entity43 , 52 were accused of ruling the unit ' with fear ' by bullying and coercing staff to cover up poor care			0
the @entity20 was heavily criticised by an inquiry into the scandal which warned it was not doing enough to protect patients from poor nurses			1
there are currently very few checks on nurses			1
they only have to prove they have completed 450 hours of work and 35 hours of learning every three years			0
the new assessments – known as revalidation – would involve nurses having to collate between five and 20 pieces of feedback from colleagues , patients , relatives and carers			2
these would probably be gathered by nurses ' managers to prevent them being selective in asking for feedback			2
an @entity71 entrance and ambulance over the past few years the @entity10 has instructed universities only to recruit nurses deemed capable of being compassionate			2
but there is concern that some nurses who have been working for years have become jaded and do not always make care and kindness a priority			0
the @entity20 yesterday launched a consultation on how the test will work and it is likely to announce further details later this year			1
dr @entity85 , chief executive and general secretary of the @entity87 , said : ' patients deserve to know every nurse is fit to practise in a modern setting and competent for the role they are performing			0
' we will be engaging with our members to inform them of the proposals as well as responding formally to the consultation			0
' what we need to ensure is that nurses are properly supported to make the revalidation system work , whether through on - going post-registration training or through mentorship and supervision , as they are already experiencing very high workloads			0
' last february @entity103 criticised the @entity20 – and doctors ' watchdog the @entity104 – for failing to protect patients			1
in a speech to the @entity108 shortly after the @entity32 inquiry , he said : ' we expect the professional regulators to strike off the doctors and nurses who seriously breach their professional code			1
but in @entity115 [ @entity116 ] those expectations were badly let down			0
' the @entity20 has also been criticised for taking too long to reprimand failing nurses and for being overly bureaucratic			1
nurse checks would be similar to those introduced for doctors in 2012			0
the @entity104 is appraising all 260,000 @entity121 registered to practise in @entity122 , with the process expected to take three years .			0

@entity20 is considering the checks
it comes in the wake of the @entity32 scandal
there are currently very few checks on nurses
