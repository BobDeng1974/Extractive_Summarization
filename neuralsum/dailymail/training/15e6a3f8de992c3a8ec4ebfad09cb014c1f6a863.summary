by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 16:30 est , 9 november 2012 stricken electrical retail chain @entity2 is axing 330 staff at its headquarters and support centres			2
administrator @entity6 across made the announcement today but stressed there had been no redundancies of shop staff and that all @entity2 's 236 stores remain open			1
the bulk of the staff cuts have been made in the company 's head office in @entity17 , @entity18 as well as at its site in @entity20 and a call centre in @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity6 added that it was holding talks with a number of potential buyers for @entity2 , which fell into administration a week ago			1
economic woes : as shoppers searched for bargains today administrator @entity6 announced 330 job losses at @entity2 the news came as bargain hunters descended on stores across the country in the hope of picking up a discount product ahead of planned closures next week			1
however , although the electrical retailer 's website announced a ' massive stock liquidation ' in its 236 stores , many dismayed shoppers were greeted with price cuts of just 10 per cent			1
many of those who dashed to visited the sale today described it as ' nothing special ' and a ' waste of time '			0
another added : ' even with a massive liquidation sale , they 're still a massive rip off ! ' @entity2 is being run by administrators @entity6 , who are moving to wind down the failed retailer ahead of closures			1
customers are only able to get the reduced prices in shops , with the website providing just a question and answer page , store locations			2
it also confirms that gift cards will be accepted during the sale , after they initially announcing that all vouchers had been suspended			0
there were a few bargains to be had in some places , however , with one @entity72 user reporting that he had bought a 14 megapixel camera for £ 50			0
but @ @entity75 echoed many shoppers ' sentiments when he tweeted : ' comet liquidation sale , rather underwhelming ! 10 % here odd 20 % there			0
very poor ! can see why they got into trouble ! ' spree : others were more successful and were seen leaving the store in @entity85 , @entity86 with cut - price electrical goods opportunity : customers picked up tvs and kitchen appliances at the liquidation sale no refunds : families in @entity95 buy what they can before @entity97 shuts up shop big promise : @entity2 's website is directing shoppers to stores for the sale , but any ordered items that are not in stock may never arrive price reductions were ' meagre ' today , warned inquirer.net , and the most attractive items were only discounted by 10 per cent			1
it added : ' in the 15 per cent discount bin we found mice , 20 per cent included fat fryers , printer ink and dvd players , and the 30 per cent lot included tv stands			0
' @entity117 , the creator of @entity118 , said : ' @entity2 sale is not earth shattering – certainly there are no once in a lifetime deals			2
' where it does scrape a few quid off are for branded goods that are rarely discounted such as @entity127 and @entity128			0
if you 're looking for tvs or washing machines , you 'll still find cheaper using comparison sites			0
' it 's also worth asking the question : what will happen if goods go wrong ? ' normally your rights are with the retailer , but if @entity2 ceases to exist soon , you 'll be reliant on the manufacturers ' warranty rather than your statutory consumer rights			2
' mixed results : discounts varied from store to store			0
left , @entity145 and right , @entity146 ' hold off ' : one shopper advised others not to bother with @entity2 because price reductions were still relatively small @entity2 's website is also warning customers that it is no longer providing refunds , and any goods ordered but not paid for prior to administration will not be delivered			1
the sale follows suggestions that staff at the collapsed chain could have the chance to join @entity160 , after the chain outlined plans to take on seasonal staff			0
the owner of @entity165 and @entity166 has delayed its normal @entity168 recruitment drive , when it expects to take on an additional 2,000 seasonal shop staff , to offer @entity2 staff the opportunity to join the business			1
@entity2 was placed into administration on friday and @entity6 has been searching for a buyer for its shops since last week			1
the high street electricals market in the @entity177 has come under huge pressure as cash - strapped shoppers put off purchases of expensive tvs and large appliances			2
it is also facing stiff competition from the low prices of online retailers such as @entity186 , which have fewer overheads - as many customers are aware			0
many customers dashed to their local @entity190 today in the hope of ' massive ' discounts only to be left sorely disappointed as @entity118 found out , some items were still cheaper in rival stores even after the price cuts			0
here 's a selection of deals they found in the @entity200 store and from searches @entity205 pre-sale @entity203 @entity202 @entity207 25 sat - nav £ 120 £ 108 10 % £ 105 £ 120 £ 118 @entity127 2 16gb wi - fi £ 329 £ 297 9.7 % £ 305 £ 329 £ 327 @entity208 6in wi - fi £ 69 £ 62 10 % £ 69 £ 69 £ 69 @entity210 202 printer £ 50 £ 45 10 % £ 45 £ 45 £ 50 @entity211 £ 150 £ 135 10 % £ 131 £ 139 £ 135			2
