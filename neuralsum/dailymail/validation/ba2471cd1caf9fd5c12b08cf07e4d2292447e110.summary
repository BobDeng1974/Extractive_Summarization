whoever agreed to schedule @entity3 ’s @entity2 quarter - final with @entity4 at 5.30 on a saturday evening showed a dangerous lack of foresight			1
it seems nobody at the @entity9 , the @entity10 , the clubs or @entity12 seriously considered that trouble might follow a day off work when fans of the two local rivals had all afternoon to drink			1
that miscalculation contributed significantly to scenes described by several former players as from the 1970s — pitch invasions , seats ripped out and used as weapons , players barged and forced to fight their way to the sanctuary of the dressing rooms			1
police clash with unruly fans in scenes reminiscent of the of the 1970s following @entity3 's @entity2 defeat of @entity4 @entity4 players look concerned as @entity3 fans invade the pitch at the end of their @entity2 quarter final @entity3 fans celebrate by racing on to the pitch following their 2 - 0 victory over @entity4 at @entity37 fans of both @entity3 and @entity4 behaved irresponsibly and have been condemned by their own clubs			1
but it is clear questions need to be asked about the way matches that carry the potential to be ‘ tasty ’ , as @entity46 described this fixture , are arranged			0
in the past , police have insisted derbies kick off early in the day			2
in this instance , the local force claim it was out of their hands , with the decision down to the @entity9			1
sources at @entity58 football ’s governing body say scheduling is a collaborative effort , including police guidance			0
the wishes of broadcasters play a huge part and evening slots are good for ratings			0
it is the reason some @entity69 fans will find it impossible to get back to @entity71 from @entity72 by train			2
insufficient numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after @entity3 booked their place in the semi-finals @entity3 fans leap over hoardings at the final whistle - while the decision to stage the game at 5.30pm is being questioned but the @entity10 , who reportedly paid up to £ 120million for the rights to show the world ’s oldest competition over four years , declined to accept responsibility			1
a spokesman said : ‘ both @entity4 and @entity3 , along with the police , agreed to the kick - off time and raised no objections			1
’ if this was a ball rather than the buck , @entity3 boss @entity99 would be pleased at how quickly it was being passed			1
following the match , the national lead officer for football policing appeared on @entity107 , and he questioned the decision to play the match on a weekend evening			2
' saturday night football is here to stay , we appreciate that , friday night football is due to be coming in , ' he said			0
@entity4 manager had described the @entity115 fixture as ' tasty ' ahead of the game @entity4 goalkeeper @entity117 is mocked by an @entity3 fan following the home side 's second goal ' when you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play			1
all games have potential ( for crowd trouble ) but clearly some games have more potential than others			0
' they are big clubs , not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture , late on a weekend in particular , alcohol is a factor			0
' if you give people four , five , six hours more drinking time , do n't be surprised if in a highly - charged atmosphere , their behaviour is n't good			1
' broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously			0
' what we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately			0
if you look at the four games for the @entity2 quarter - finals this week , you could n't probably have picked a worse one to have on a saturday tea - time than a local derby between two big clubs			1
' the @entity4 goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full - time whistle scorer @entity158 ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team - mates @entity161 and @entity162 fans sing and chant on the pitch following @entity3 's win during what has been a disappointing season @entity4 sources suggested the kick - off time did cause concern but no formal objection was made			1
similar timings have been used before for derbies but with 6,500 @entity4 fans travelling across town on saturday — significantly more than usual — the risk of trouble was surely increased			1
@entity3 face the prospect of a fine in the region of £ 100,000 for failing to adequately control hundreds of fans who ran on to the pitch before referee @entity182 blew for full - time			1
the top - end punishment would be a partial stadium closure			0
the @entity9 have launched an investigation and will ask why only a dozen or so stewards were at the @entity37 corner where @entity3 fans burst on to the pitch , causing a two - minute delay			1
there had been invasions after both goals and the final 60 seconds were played out with a mass of people congregated on the sidelines			0
thousands spilled on when @entity3 ’s win was confirmed			1
many were in a celebratory mood , wishing to hug their players , even if first goalscorer @entity202 was inadvertently bitten by fans overly eager to plant a kiss			1
on this basis , pitch invasions have been previously celebrated			0
but there was a sinister undercurrent too			0
many wanted to goad beaten opponents			0
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity117 was repeatedly shoved in a confrontational manner			2
a group encircled him , filming on their mobiles			0
he picked one phone up and chucked it away			0
@entity3 players @entity217 ( centre ) and @entity162 ( right ) are mobbed by fans after the game goalscorer @entity202 claims fans nicked his captain 's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion @entity4 forward @entity227 is escorted off the field after a row with an @entity3 fan @entity227 had to be shepherded to safety after an altercation with a @entity3 fan left him shaken , while sub keeper @entity234 had a finger pushed in his face			1
even those who feel pitch invasions can joyously mark a momentous occasion must recognise the inherent danger of saturday night			2
during the 93rd - minute surge those who remained in their seats booed loudly			2
former @entity3 striker @entity244 said on @entity245 : ‘ @entity248 disgrace , drunken yobs besmirching the name of @entity3			2
’ @entity250 , commentating on the @entity10 , said : ‘ there are not enough stewards at the @entity37			1
it ’s like a scene from the 1980s all over again			0
’ an @entity3 supporter is escorted off by stewards after invading the pitch before full time @entity158 is crowded by @entity3 supporters after scoring his goal in the 2 - 0 victory there appeared to be almost three times as many stewards at the other end , forming a line in front of the @entity269 housing @entity4 fans above those supporting @entity3			1
those seating arrangements have been questioned after one fan was left with a bloody wound when a seat ripped from the tier above hit him on the head			0
@entity281 , who played for both clubs , said : ‘ seeing those seats come down , it could kill someone			2
those people should be found and banned			0
’ a @entity4 statement read : ‘ the club is aware of reports of serious misbehaviour involving some of its own supporters			2
it issues an uncompromising reminder that any supporter found guilty of disorder can expect the appropriate sanction from the club			0
we will continue to operate zero tolerance to any fans who bring the club ’s reputation into disrepute			0
’ privately , @entity4 were perplexed about the seating arrangements			2
a match against fierce rivals from across town , finishing as night descended , was always going to carry an edge			0
@entity3 manager @entity99 admitted he could understand the fans ' emotions after the victory the pitch at @entity37 can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass also of concern will be coins thrown at @entity314 as he took corners			1
@entity4 chairman @entity317 is said to have left @entity37 in a rage			1
no injuries have been reported to @entity12 , who said 17 arrests had been made for public order as well as drunk and disorderly offences			0
chief superintendent @entity324 said a probe had also been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the @entity330 pub , down the road from @entity37			2
@entity332 will be studied as will any footage obtained from the police helicopter			0
but those investigating should look at themselves			0
@entity3 fans celebrate victory on the pitch after what has been a highlight of a lacklustre season @entity3 supporter @entity343 needed his hair cut and wound glued together on saturday night			1

@entity3 moved into the @entity2 semi-finals with a 2 - 0 defeat of @entity4 at @entity37 on saturday
@entity3 and @entity4 fans behaved irresponsibly by invading the pitch , ripping out seats and *abusing* players
