antlers discovered by walkers on a beach in the @entity3 , could be 20,000 years old , one has expert claimed			1
@entity5 and his daughter @entity6 found the antlers poking out of the muddy shore with a large section of deer skull , on @entity11 , off the coast at @entity13 , @entity14			1
in april 2012 , an eight - year - old called @entity16 found a perfectly preserved 3ft ( 91cm ) high antler on the same beach , which were at the time was thought to be 4,000 years old - but it could be much older			1
what a find ! @entity0 ( pictured ) discovered by walkers on a beach in the @entity3 , could be 20,000 years old , one expert claims , but carbon dating is required to make sure they are as old as suspected carbon dating is needed to ascertain the precise age of both specimens			1
@entity27 , @entity28 ’s curator of earth sciences , has examined photos of the antlers , which are believed to belong to a two - year - old red deer			1
he said : ‘ we have found similar material from 10 to 20,000 years ago in the @entity35 , so that is why i suggested that figure for the age			2
‘ for example there was a similar skull found when they were digging the @entity43 in the 1880s			0
@entity5 and his daughter and @entity6 ( pictured ) found the prehistoric antlers poking out of the muddy shore with a large section of deer skull , when on a leisurely walk the interesting remains were found on @entity11 , off the coast at @entity13 , @entity14 ( marked on the map ) @entity55 fossil hunters have hauled woolly mammoth bones from the @entity57 , which was icy tundra 40,000 years ago			1
the group of archaeologists , salvagers and palaeontologists trawl the waters off the east coast of @entity65 at a depth of 100 feet ( 30 metres ) and in 2010 discovered bones belonging to an 11ft ( 3.4 metre ) tall mammoth			2
they collected its skull , tusks and other large bones , and filled in any missing ones with finds from similar beasts discovered nearby of a similar age , to form a complete skeleton after months of work			2
they also uncovered bones belonging to woolly rhinos and @entity83 elks , plus a prehistoric skull of a @entity86 bison , also known as a @entity87 on the @entity57 bed			0
carbon dating tests revealed that some of the bones belonged to a mammoth that roamed @entity93 - a former landmass in the southern @entity57 that connected @entity95 to mainland @entity86 - around 40,000 years ago			1
‘ it is very difficult to tell the age with any accuracy , particularly just from a photograph , but there is no evidence to suggest it is @entity102			0
' the period stretches from @entity104 to 800 bc. ‘ it may well be that both antlers are @entity102 - or both are older - it depends on what their estimation of the age was based upon , for example , if something is found with other objects that are more straightforward to date , such as tools , ’ he added			1
the antlers and skull were discovered semi-submerged in the clay mud after being washed out by a high - tide			2
carbon dating is the only way to know for sure exactly how old the antlers and skull are , but dr @entity27 said that due to the cost and length of the process , it may not be an option			1
he explained : ‘ it is particularly difficult ( to estimate ) if something is found on a beach as it could have been washed in from anywhere and may not be the same age as the sediment where it was found			2
‘ there is only really one lab in the @entity137 , based in @entity138 , that undertakes this kind of dating			0
‘ it is quite expensive and takes many months , so is only undertaken for the most important finds			0
carbon dating is the only way to know for sure exactly how old the antlers and skull is , but dr @entity27 said that due to the cost and length of the process , it may not be an option			2
palaeontologists think the remains belong to a two - year - old red deer but its gender is unknown ‘ unfortunately , i ca n’t promise that carbon dating would be done on this specimen			1
’ the first antler was found by @entity16 , who spotted what looked like a stick poking through the shingle at @entity158 , two years ago			0
as he dug it out , he realised it was an ancient antler			0
‘ it was kind of sticking out of the stones			0
i started brushing the stones away and found it was an antler , ’ he said			0
the antlers and skull were found semi-submerged in the clay mud after being washed out by a high - tide			0
this image shows a section of jaw that was sticking out of the clay			0

palaeontologists think the ancient bones belong to a two - year - old red deer
they were found on @entity11 , off the coast at @entity13 in @entity14
an antler discovered on same beach in 2012 , thought to be 4,000 years old , could also be much older than *previously* thought
carbon dating is required to determine the antlers ' precise age
