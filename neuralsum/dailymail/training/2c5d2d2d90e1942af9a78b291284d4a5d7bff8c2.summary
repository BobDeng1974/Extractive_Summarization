@entity0 was able to survive for five months before being forced to deliver @entity10 , weighing just 2lbs 1oz , by @entity11 - and even managed to hold her on one occasion before succumbing to the disease three days later			1
it was he @entity0 called in march when she received the unfathomable news that she was pregnant after years of thinking she was infertile			1
' you 're not going to believe this , ' the mother - to - be had told him in a mixture of laughter and tears , according to @entity25			0
but over the next days and weeks , as she shopped for all the things her baby would need , a serious worry began to gnaw at @entity0			1
she was having severe headaches and double vision , while tremors struck every inch of her body			0
she began to tell @entity20 of her growing concerns			0
' i 'm worried about this baby , ' she said in one text , according to the @entity25			2
' i hope i live long enough to have this baby , ' said another message			2
' @entity50 , if anything happens to me , you take this child			0

she had tumours on her brain			0
she often became unconscious and had not been able to sign @entity10 's birth certificate			1
@entity0 was too weak to be taken to her baby , and her baby was too weak to be brought to her			1

but she had not yet held , kissed or looked into the blue eyes of the baby whose life she had chosen above her own			0
nurse @entity154 , herself a mother , could not bear to think of @entity0 's emotional pain and decided to do something about it			1
she worked with nurse @entity160 and talked to @entity161 , the medical centre 's neonatal transport team , about using a capsule - like @entity164 to safely move @entity10 to her mother			2
special unit : @entity10 had to be transferred into an @entity164 module so she could be taken from intensive care to her mother ' i knew all of this was going on in the background and i did n't say nothing to her until i knew it was going to happen because i did n't want to get her hopes up , ' @entity20 said			1
he asked his sister what she would would think about seeing her daughter that day			0
@entity0 's eyes popped open and she began looking around to find her			2
