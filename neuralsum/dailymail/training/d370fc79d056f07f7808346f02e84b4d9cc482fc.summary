by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 21:08 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 03:10 est , 27 november 2012 a new flu vaccine that may work for life is in development in @entity6			1
the experimental vaccine based on a molecule related to @entity10 currently protects animals against influenza and may one day offer a fast way to develop new shots for humans , @entity6 scientists said on sunday			1
assuming the vaccine also works in people , the new approach could allow commercial flu shots to be designed and manufactured in weeks rather than months			1
vaccine experimentation : a new flu shot called @entity22 hit the market last fall making vaccines quickly is critical in fighting influenza , particularly during a pandemic when health authorities and drugmakers are in a race to keep up with mutating strains of virus			1
flu vaccines have traditionally been produced in chicken eggs , a tricky and lengthy process			2
more recently some firms have started using animal cell cultures , with @entity37 on november 20 winning the first @entity39 approval for such a product			0
both approaches , however , still involve virus cultivation , which can result in variable yields and production delays			0
the new vaccine developed by @entity46 of @entity47 and colleagues uses a quicker approach			0
it is made solely of messenger rna ( @entity52 ) -- a single - stranded molecule that carries information telling cells which proteins to make			1
vaccine boss : professor @entity46 of @entity6 's @entity47 and his colleagues developed the new vaccine @entity10 related : @entity52 ( @entity52 ) is a large family of @entity52 molecules that convey genetic information from dna to the ribosome ‘ the only thing we need is the sequence of the relevant genes , ’ @entity46 said			1
‘ it 's a new option and it does n't take long to do			0
’ his team vaccinated mice , ferrets and pigs with an @entity52 vaccine and found that the immune response was similar or better than that found with conventional vaccines			0
what is more , the new vaccines showed high efficacy in very young and very old animals , which can be a problem with current flu shots			1
reporting their results in the journal @entity86 , the scientists calculated that a completed vaccine could be produced within six to eight weeks of the genetic code of a flu virus strain being published			1
in contrast growing vaccines in fertilised chicken eggs can take up to six months , while using cell cultures may reduce that by up to eight to 10 weeks			0
another potential advantage of @entity52 vaccines is the fact that they do not need to be refrigerated			0
a human vaccine based on the research is still years away , since extensive clinical trials will be needed to test safety and efficacy , and the job of taking the work forward now rests with @entity105 , a privately owned biotech company			2
@entity105 , backed by billionaire @entity6 investor and business software firm @entity107 's co-founder @entity108 , is already developing a therapeutic @entity52 vaccine for prostate cancer in human trials			2
the firm also has a vaccine for lung cancer in development and is working on prophylactic vaccines against several unnamed infectious diseases in a collaboration with @entity119			2
@entity119 is a major supplier of flu vaccines , along with @entity37 and @entity121 .			0
