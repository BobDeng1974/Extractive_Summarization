it was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity36 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity38			0
other rumours suggest the @entity2 will feature @entity41 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			2
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
in july last year , reports in the @entity52 said @entity1 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity2			1
@entity1 has refused to hint at what announcement will be made			2
' we have the most amazing developer community in the world and have a great week planned for them , ' said @entity60 , @entity1 ’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing			2
' every year the @entity7 audience becomes more diverse , with developers from almost every discipline you can imagine and coming from every corner of the globe			0
' we look forward to sharing with them our latest advances in @entity69 and @entity70 so they can create the next generation of great apps			0
' the conference , aimed at app developers , @entity7 will feature more than 100 technical sessions , and over 1,000 @entity1 engineers will attend to offer help			2
in previous years , the company has unveiled major new versions of its @entity69 and @entity70 software for @entity81 at the event , as well as new @entity38 - although the firm is not expected to unveil these until september this year			2
however , @entity1 fans have not waited for the announcement , and many have released stunning new images of what they believes @entity1 's @entity2 could look like			1
the latest images reveal two models , a luxury @entity19 with a metal case and leather strap , and a plastic @entity94 the incredibly realistic images were mocked up by artist and @entity1 fan @entity13 , and even show how the timepiece would look in @entity1 '' s retail stores			2
the incredibly detailed mockups even reveal how the watch could be displayed in @entity1 's stores the mockups are @entity105 's second attempt at an @entity2 , having worked with @entity107 magazine for the first			1
' right after @entity1 launched the colorful @entity111 i figured it would be nice to have a look at adding color to my original @entity2 concept , ' he said			1
' i added some color , simplified the design and basically turned it into an @entity111 for around your wrist			0
' the latest rumours around the secret smartwatch claim @entity1 has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its @entity2 project , it has been claimed			1
it is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep , letting wearers track and analyse their every movement			0
although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch , experts believe it could be released this year			0
the @entity2 c would match @entity1 's iphone 5c perfectly @entity137 reported that @entity138 -- whose background includes working on wearables , sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined @entity1 from @entity144			1
the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called @entity147 that will be built into the next version of its @entity69 software , allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect			1
the firm 's @entity153 already has a movement tracking chip , called the @entity156 , which is expected to be used in the @entity2			1
reports in the @entity158 claim the first - generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly , using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases			1
yet future models of the wrist - worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge			0
solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the @entity2 , for example , and harness the sun 's energy			2
the watch imagined by @entity174 has a square screen , while it believed the rear could have sensors to monitor a wearer 's health			0
@entity105 even revealed some advertising concepts he thought @entity1 could use for the @entity2 @entity183 , for example , already uses solar technology in its g - shock range of watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch			1
this is further supported by the fact that in september , @entity1 posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise			2
other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next - generation of @entity1 software , likely to be called @entity69 8			1
another image showing how the @entity2 could look in @entity1 stores all these current claims back up the plans laid out in an @entity1 patent filed in 2011			1
the patent described a ' wearable accessory device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user 's wrist			0
it also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended , including a ' solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device ' , or ' a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches			0
' these current claims confirm plans laid out in an 2011 @entity1 patent			0
the patent described a ' wearable device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap , patent image pictured			0
its battery life could be extended , using a ' solar panel array ' , or ' a kinetic power source other watchmakers , including @entity183 , already use solar technology in their products			0
for example , the @entity240 , pictured , can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch ' an accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation , and could lengthen the amount of time between charging , ' the application continued			0
similarly , a patent filed in 2009 detailed how @entity1 wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of an arm or leg as the wearer was walking			0
the curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent , awarded last year , which gave @entity1 the option to install a flexible battery into future products			0
last week , reports claimed @entity268 was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next - generation smartwatch , dubbed @entity271 2			1
the original watch launched in september last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life			0
elsewhere , other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen , similar to the concept images pictured , and run the next - generation of @entity1 software , likely to be called @entity69 8 some analysts claimed the device was rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market , beating @entity1 and @entity285 to their respective rumoured devices			1
whereas @entity1 may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much about what customers liked , and did n't like , in the @entity268 version			2
since the first @entity1 @entity2 rumours emerged in 2012 , a number of artists have created concept images of what it may look like			1
@entity1 is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much - rumoured @entity297 , concept pictured , to remove the need for wires and chargers			2
reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly , while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy many resembled the square and clunky design of @entity268 ’s @entity271 , yet the latest images from @entity309 designer @entity308 imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device			1
@entity308 took inspiration from fitness bands , as well as the look and functionality of @entity1 ’s @entity315 , to create a watch that is ‘ like something @entity1 would actually produce			0
' the concept watch is shown as a simple band , fitted round the wrist like the @entity321 , with a curved touchscreen			0
previous @entity2 concept images , including this one from @entity325 magazine , featured a square screen , and a clunky design , that more closely resembled @entity268 's @entity271 smartwatch @entity268 beat @entity1 to the smartwatch market when it released its @entity330 - powered @entity271 , pictured , in september			1
however , its design , functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe @entity1 may have delayed its @entity2 release to learn more about what customers like , and do n't like			1

@entity339 will be held june 2 - 6 in @entity8
reports claim the first - generation @entity1 @entity2 will be wirelessly charged
@entity1 also said to be developing ' *healthbook* ' app to analyse data
