by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 11:24 est , 18 january 2013 when you see someone falling over on an icy pavement , most people 's first reaction is to help them up and check they 're not hurt			1
but that was n't the case with this mystery cameraman in @entity9 , who noticed everyone falling over at a particular spot in the frozen city centre			1
instead , he or she decided to set up their camera in the building opposite and film people as they tried , usually without success , to negotiate the tricky patch of pavement			1
like penguins in a nature documentary , one person after the other decides to ignore the warning sign and traffic cones and try their luck on the @entity25 bridge over the @entity54			1
the film , which is accompanied by trance music , was watched more than 25,000 times in the 24 hours after it was posted yesterday			2
entitled ' @entity63 ' , as a reference to the popular 1980s @entity61 tv series @entity59 , it says : ' there is a single spot where it is almost inevitable not to fall over , as you can see ! ' it shows dozens of pedestrians , thankfully none of them wearing @entity71 's tiny hotpants , skid and land heavily on their bottoms as they try to get past the ice			0
hundreds of people posted comments , with one saying : ' everyone was probably thinking to themselves ï»¿ " i hope nobody saw that "			2
' actually the whole internet will see that ; ) '			0
they keep on coming : another unsuspecting person comes a cropper beside the warning traffic cones sore bottom : the pedestrian looks like he must have hurt himself when he fell backwards onto the ice better in good weather : a view of @entity9 's @entity25 looking towards the bridge where so many fell while the majority of the @entity95 got its first proper snowfall today , @entity9 was blanketed in snow at the beginning of the week , causing schools to close and transport chaos as trains , buses and even flights to and from @entity9 airport were cancelled or delayed			1
@entity105 escaped more heavy snow this morning but it was forecast to fall this afternoon as blizzard conditions spread across the country from the west			0
@entity111 and the @entity112 were particularly badly hit , with hundreds of schools closed and motorists facing treacherous conditions			0
the @entity117 motorway was closed between @entity118 and @entity119 and trains and flights delayed as @entity118 and @entity123 airports were closed			0
' i wonder what the weather 's got in store ? ' : this pedestrian looks like he 's checking his mobile as he walks steady ! the ice , which gets more and more dangerous , gets the upper hand as the man loses his footing no @entity135 : the pedestrian joins the long list of casualties as he heads for a certain fall on the winter ice and he 's gone : the @entity141 claims yet another victim to add to a very long list three down ... : one after another , the tumbling pedestrians fell victim to the slippery ice on the bridge easy does it : this pedestrian thought that gentle tiptoeing might get them across ... but it did n't embarrassing : falling over on the ice is humiliating enough without it being filmed and put on @entity156			0

hilarious footage show people in @entity9 slipping over like penguins
traffic cones and warning signs are no deterrent to the *foolhardy*
