by @entity0 in @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has pledged that she will try to bring a female touch to @entity6 ’s coaching , while emphasising that her job is simply to help him win more @entity9			1
on the day @entity10 retained his @entity12 title @entity6 sent shockwaves through the tennis world yesterday by appointing the 34 year - old former @entity16 champion and world number one as his coach for the grass court season , and almost certainly beyond			1
' i think he 's maybe looking for something different , about emotions and sensitive things , ' said @entity3 , although she played down the symbolism of what is an unprecedented move for such a top male player			1
bold step : @entity6 , who began training for the grass season today , has caused a stir by appointing @entity3 proven class : @entity3 was women 's number won and won two grand slams , including @entity16 ' it 's not really interesting for me , this part of the story , to be honest			1
all i 'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals			0
he ’s an amazingly talented tennis player and i feel i have plenty to offer him			0
' it will change a little bit my life and my retirement , let 's say			2
i 'm passionate about this sport			0
miracles do n’t happen overnight but i love challenges			0
' @entity3 added that they had agreed to work for a ‘ significant amount of weeks ’ per year , assuming that the initial period is satisfactory			1
@entity6 explained the background to a move being seen as smashing a glass ceiling for female coaching : ' i spoke to her a few times on the phone and when i was in @entity1 i met her before the tournament , ' he said			2
' we chatted a little bit about it , whether she ’d be up for doing it			0
there was a will from both sides to give it a go and see how it works out			0
shared experience : @entity3 won @entity16 in 2006 while @entity6 finally took the title last year watching on : @entity3 was at the @entity12 final on sunday before starting work with @entity6 ' she ’s obviously a fantastic player			1
she won @entity16 , was @entity77 no. 1 , won the @entity78			2
just from speaking to her , she ’s very calm , she ’ s a good person			0
i think we will communicate well together and i think that ’s a very important part of coaching			0
' i obviously worked with my mum for a long time , even periods when i was 16 , 17 years old			2
for me it does n’t feel like a very different thing			0
obviously i was n’t paying my mum so it ’ll be a little bit different this time around because i ’ll be employing @entity3			1
i think it ’s exciting , something a bit new for me , something a bit fresh and hopefully it works well			0
' @entity92 was among those pleased to see @entity6 taking such a bold and agenda - setting step : , tweeting : ' an interesting call by @entity6			1
cool to see a woman coaching a top guy			0
hope it works out for them			0
' @entity100 , a @entity102 contemporary of @entity3 who knows her well , told the @entity104 : ' she is a great person , she 's got great values and a sense of hard work but she has a great sense of humour			1
' she knows what it takes to win @entity9 , what it takes to get to number one , she will take it very seriously and give her absolute best to help @entity6			1
' anguish : @entity6 had a strong @entity102 open before being thrashed by @entity10 in the semi-final repeat success : @entity6 is desperate to replicate his win in @entity121 last year after a promising @entity102 open two of the men who know @entity6 best from working with him , his ex-coaches @entity124 and @entity125 , believe he has made an intelligent choice			1
' i think this is good news for @entity6 , she should be a calming influence , ' said @entity124			2
' she was a smart player with an outstanding knowledge of the game who brings a fresh perspective and i think she will add a lot to @entity6 ’s team			2
' @entity125 added : ' i think it ’s a sound move			0
@entity3 is clearly someone @entity6 likes and respects and she will bring something different			1
there just was n’t an ideal male coach out there , and so why not go with a woman who has plenty of knowledge			2

@entity147 has appointed two - time @entity9 champion
@entity102 is also a former @entity150 1
@entity3 says she will work with @entity6 ' significan amount of weeks ' every year , and her aim is to help him win more @entity9
@entity6 has been without a coach since splitting with @entity156
@entity3 will take up her new role in time for @entity159 's this week
