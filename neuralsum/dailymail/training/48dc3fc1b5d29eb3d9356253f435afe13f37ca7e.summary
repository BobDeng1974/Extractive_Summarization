student nurse @entity8 , 21 , took cash from her employer and used it to pay off credit cards and buy cannabis and a new @entity13			1
however , after she told magistrates she was ' acutely remorseful ' about the crime and expressed concern about her future career , they said she would have to repay only £ 5 a week			1
@entity19 , manager of @entity21 's bar in @entity22 , @entity23 , set up a @entity25 camera disguised as a smoke alarm after noticing that money was going missing from the till			1
he saw @entity2 stuffing banknotes into her handbag , and when he confronted her she admitted stealing the money to pay for credit card and loan bills			1
she also spent the cash on cannabis , an xbox console , a new @entity13 , hair extensions and bicycles which she gave to young relatives			1
' within 12 minutes of her shift starting , she went to the cash drawer , took the money out , and put it in her bag , ' mr @entity19 said			1
' we then watched the rest of her shift , and she was just taking money out of the drawer over and over during the night and putting them in her purse			2
there were people at the bar while she was doing it			2
' caught : a hidden cctv camera filmed @entity2 taking bundles of cash from the bar stash : she put the money in her handbag and later spent it on drugs and expensive gadgets @entity2 , from @entity65 , pleaded guilty to theft at @entity67 , but was told she only had to repay £ 500 at a rate of £ 5 a week , to be deducted from her benefit payments			1
mr @entity19 says he can not reclaim the additional £ 2,500 from his insurer because the theft was an ' inside job '			1

' but i was fuming when i heard what she got			0
payback at £ 5 a week is a joke and just mere pocket money for what she did - and as a taxpayer i even have to pay it because it comes out of her benefits			1

i let her run the pub , and if she was stuck for money i would lend it to her			1
i ca n't believe she has betrayed us like this			0
' when we went to court and heard the verdict i just sat there shocked and appalled			0
i have never had money stolen from me before and never thought it would be from one of my own			2
' the irony is that you do n't expect your staff , your family even , to steal from you			0
i will never get that money back			2
' mr @entity19 added that he had never suspected that @entity2 could be capable of the crime , due to the long - standing links between him and his employee			0
