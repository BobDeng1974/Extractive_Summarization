by @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 12:03 est , 8 august 2013 a @entity2 superfan has created a unique book of ordinary people 's chance encounters with the world ’s most famous band			1
the @entity2 and me by @entity9 , which is being officially launched on monday , is devoted to meetings between @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , and their adoring fans			1
compiled from more than 700 contributions , it contains stories and pictures from over five decades of @entity20			1
rare : a fragile signed photo given to fan @entity23 of a young @entity24 and @entity25 at the barbers ' @entity27 : @entity28 and @entity29 who ran the @entity30 getting to meet their hero @entity31 iconic studios : @entity35 fan @entity33 met @entity31 outside @entity36 in 1982 the book came together after @entity9 set up a @entity39 page at @entity40 to learn about other people ’s memories of meeting @entity2			1
@entity9 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' everyone here has a @entity2 story , whether they have met them personally or they know someone who worked on one of their bathrooms			1
' i thought it would be a laugh to set up the page and see if anyone had anything interesting to say			2
' posts came flooding in and the idea snowballed			1
the things people posted were fantastic and very interesting			2
' perhaps the most touching of the tales was a story of when somebody was stopped outside @entity66 a few months before @entity25 died			2
relaxed : @entity31 with his late wife @entity67 hanging affectionately to his arm , taken by fan @entity33 young love : @entity31 and his wife @entity67 caught in an unposed moment , taken by fan @entity73 @entity74 around : the @entity75 in @entity76 taken by fan @entity73 as they take a convertible for a spin fun encounter : fan @entity80 with a smart - looking @entity24 and @entity81 in july 1976 in @entity82 ' they said that some ' scruffy guy ' asked : ‘ where is a good place to eat ? it has all changed around here ? ’ ' ' it turned out it was @entity13 coming back home one last time and he took a local stranger for a drink to thank him for showing him around			2
' after the @entity39 page became so popular , @entity9 decided to turn the collection into a book for fans around the world to cherish forever			1
@entity9 said : ' the reaction was unexpected but brilliant and the book has become a valuable source of @entity2 history			1
' there have been hundreds of books published that give you a general history of the band - where they were born , how they grew to fame , but nothing personal about the real them and what they mean to their fans			2
' it ’s the first book to gather their history from the fans ’ point of view and it ’s the first book about them to be culled from @entity39			1
personal touch : an apology letter from the @entity2 to say that a fan could have an advance copy of the latest album in 1969 very early gig : confirmation of the @entity2 playing at the @entity126 in @entity127 right at the beginning of their illustrious career stories in the book include one from a @entity132 , which reads : ' a mate of mine was teaching a @entity31 gig			1
' the sound manager took everyone aside beforehand and said , ‘ you are not allowed to look at mr. @entity31			2
' ' you are not allowed to address mr. @entity31 directly			0
you can only talk to mr @entity31 if he addresses you first ’			0
' later on , my mate was laying a cable on the ground			0
she tried to move one cable and it would n’t shift , so she looked up the cable to see what the problem was and saw a foot			0
' ’ hey , shift yer [ sic ] foot , ' said she , and looked up to see @entity31 lift his foot up quickly and go , ‘ oh , sorry ‘ bout that ! ’ ' ' she realised she had mucked up talking to " the man " , but he seemed genuinely apologetic , so she passed it off			0
' ten minutes later , the sound manager came up to her and said , ' ‘ you ’ve got ten minutes			0
go down to your locker , get your stuff and get out '			0
' treasured memory : @entity31 with fan @entity160 , one of 700 contributions from the @entity2 ' five decades of fame team photo : @entity31 always looks happy to see @entity2 fans , however many thousands of photographs he has posed for in his long career ' my mate was absolutely horrified but , not wanting to make a fuss , did what she was told and headed down to the lockers			1
she was just packing her stuff when he got a tap on the shoulder			0
' ’ @entity174 , sorry about that			0
it was n’t your fault and we ’ve sorted it			0
you can head back up to work if you want to ’			0
' she went upstairs and continued to work			0
the sound manager got sacked			0
' another tale was by a girl who ran a fan club dedicated to @entity25			2
seeing how much she liked him , he invited her over to @entity189 to meet him but when she turned up , he had forgotten their arrangement			0
@entity13 walked out of the house with @entity192 and told her he could n’t see her that day but asked her to come back the following year			0
she did just that and he took her out for a meal with him			0
other contributions to the book include a letter sent from @entity2 to a @entity198 , dated 16th june , 1969			1
decades of adoration : @entity31 with fan @entity73 , who was one of hundreds of fans who shared his photographs for the book over the moon : @entity205 , a fan wearing a @entity24 t - shirt chatting to @entity31 in 1982 within the letter , the band apologise to mr @entity198 for being unable to ' fulfill their original promise of sending him a ticket to a @entity2 tv show as a prize for winning the fan club competition			1
' they go on to say , ' we are really very sorry about this , and have spent a long time thinking of an alternative which would not be a mere consolation for the original prize			2
' anyway , at last we ’re able to tell you that your new prize - and we hope you like it - is to be an advance copy of the @entity2 new album , which at the moment we ’re expecting to release towards the end of august			1
' @entity2 would all like to congratulate you on winning , and hope you will accept their apologies for the delay			1
' also submitted to the @entity39 site , which can be seen in the published book , are private photos taken by fans			2
global appeal : a new generation of fans with @entity14 in @entity238 the book , which retails for £ 8.75 , is being launched at @entity241 exhbition at the @entity242 , on monday			0
@entity9 added : ' these stories are the other side of @entity20			1
' it is important that we document the fans ’ side of the @entity251 phenomenon			0
