by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 13:59 est , 12 november 2012 a prototype app for the @entity2 allows users to turn any tabletop into a keyboard			2
the @entity6 uses the @entity2 's built - in accelerometer to read the vibrations as fingers tap a surface to work out which ' key ' is being pressed			1
by analysing the strength and frequency of tremors through the surface the phone is resting on , the software works out the approximate location of the strike on a virtual qwerty keyboard			1
scroll down to see it in action good vibes : a student at @entity23 has developed an @entity2 app which uses the gadget 's built - in accelerometer to interpret taps on a tabletop as strikes on a full - size keyboard the app has been developed by @entity33 designer @entity31 for his one - year cognitive computing master 's degree at @entity23			1
' touch screen devices , such as smartphones , lack a suitable method for text input which can compete with mechanical keyboards , ' mr @entity35 said			0
' the @entity6 aims to appease the frustration felt by smartphone users when faced with drafting lengthy emails or notes on a small onscreen keyboard			1
' the keyboard requires no additional hardware as it taps into an @entity2 's built - in accelerometer , which is able to measure the vibrations caused by typing on any hard surface			1
' a @entity52 entrepreneur is marketing carved wooden keyboards created from maple and walnut trees from the @entity56			0
mixing one of man 's oldest materials with modern technology , each keyboard is wireless , using @entity63 to connect to pcs and tablets			2
@entity66 said his work is an attempt to stop the ' impersonal , lifeless aesthetic ' that came in with the computer			0
the software needs to be trained to interpret the tremors typing fingers produce on the particular surface used			2
after collecting examples of all the keys on the keyboard , it compares new data to this training data to roughly work out which key have been pressed			1
so far mr @entity35 has been able to reach an 80 per cent accuracy using the system , so errors occur the software will ' assume ' what the user intended to write using an auto - correct dictionary			1
mr @entity35 , who created the system as part of studies into user interfaces , told the @entity94 : ' the signals i ’m collecting are very weak			0
' at the moment it ’s more of a proof of concept but if you made the accelerometer more sensitive you could improve the accuracy quite easily			0
' the technology has been designed for @entity2 , but mr @entity35 was forced to use a ' jailbroken ' device as @entity105 does not allow apps to change the way that its @entity109 keyboard works			0
he says the software could easily be developed for other operating systems or devices which use accelerometers , however			0
demonstrating the technology in a video , mr @entity35 uses a piece of paper printed with an image of a keyboard to train the software and then type out a text message			0
showing how it could be used by a touch - typist , he then takes away the paper and continues to type directly on the wooden surface .			2

@entity6 *invented* by @entity33 designer for his @entity129 project
it reads the strength and frequency of vibrations to interpret keys pressed
so far it 's only 80 *%* accurate , but *includes* auto - correct dictionary
