@entity1 captain @entity0 has urged @entity3 ’s youngsters to widen their football horizons by playing overseas			1
the @entity6 central defender , who yesterday confirmed he has signed a new five - year contract with @entity1 , also believes @entity3 will play in a @entity9 final by 2030			1
@entity6 are emerging as one of @entity13 football ’s leading nations , boasting talent such as @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			2
their emergence as a world force is in stark contrast to @entity3 ’s recent decline			2
hard - earned : @entity0 says he owes a lot of his success to moving abroad at a young age down with the kids : @entity0 joined @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 to launch the new season while @entity32 have moved around the world to further their careers , @entity31 professionals seem content to stay at home			1
now 28 - year - old @entity0 , who left @entity36 for @entity1 when he was 22 , believes @entity3 ’s most talented youngsters can only benefit from spending time out of their comfort zone			1
@entity0 believes the problem is down to the @entity41 mindset , and says : ‘ if you ask a kid at 17 , go play in @entity45 or go and play in the first division in @entity47 , 90 per cent will go for @entity45			2
‘ open the borders in your head			0
it is not just an opportunity , it is also education			0
’ @entity0 adds : ‘ what has made my development is not the fact that i started in the ( @entity32 ) premier league at 17 or 18			2
it is the fact that i started at @entity60 at 17 and played @entity61 at 17 and moved on when i was 20			0
early start : @entity0 was playing @entity61 football from a young age when at @entity60 champion : @entity0 has won two @entity66 titles since joining @entity1 in 2008 ‘ that made a difference for players like me , @entity15 , @entity71 , ( @entity73 ) @entity72 — all the players in my national team			1
we started at smaller clubs			0
' @entity41 players should accept at a younger age to take experience abroad or in leagues where it is easier to play			1
they need to be more prepared to go for that experience and then come back			0
’ @entity3 ’s poor showing in the @entity9 has merely underlined their fading status on the world stage but @entity0 insists he can see signs of a resurgence			1
‘ people talk about the great facilities in @entity3 but they ’ve only been here for two to three years , ’ he says			2
‘ you have to wait			0
@entity3 will play a @entity9 final in the next four competitions for the simple reason that no other country has the resources to put that much into facilities			1
committed : @entity99 and @entity100 have both joined @entity101 in committing their future to @entity1 ‘ it ’s simple			0
you ( @entity3 ) rest on your laurels a little because you have had success for so long , then you get a slap like the last @entity9 and it makes you progress 10 years			1
‘ it was a very important slap , one that will make @entity41 players reach another level			1
’ on his new deal , @entity0 adds : ‘ the main thing is not so much that i ’ve signed but that i see @entity99 signing , @entity114 , ( @entity116 ) @entity115 , @entity100 ... it ’s a huge sign of commitment			2
' all those could have played for the top three clubs in the world but they believe in the @entity1 project			0
in control : @entity0 says @entity3 will make one of the next four @entity9 finals because of their resources ‘ i do n’t see any club who can honestly say every season they are going to compete for as many trophies as we are			1
' in the @entity61 , three clubs — @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 — are a step ahead of everyone			0
that was the case in the @entity66			0
it was @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142			0
‘ that has been changed — and now i would like nothing more than to upset the order in @entity13			0

@entity0 *predicts* @entity3 will make a @entity9 final by 2030
@entity41 players too *scared* to move abroad early
but unrivaled resources will mean national game *flourishes* eventually
@entity0 says he owes success to early moves and good experiences
