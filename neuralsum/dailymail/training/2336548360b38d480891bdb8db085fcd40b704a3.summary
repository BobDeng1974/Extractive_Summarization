@entity1 was handing out around £ 60million a day in foreign aid towards the end of the year in order to meet @entity6 's target , a report has found			1
taxpayers funded £ 11.5billion of overseas development projects in 2013 – the first time the @entity11 's aim to hand out 0.7pc of gdp to developing countries has been achieved			1
but a report has found this involved a major effort by civil servants at the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , who had to increase their spending by a third compared with the previous year			1
taxpayers handed out £ 60million per day for overseas development projects towards the end of 2013 to meet @entity6 's target in november and december of that year alone , they had to spent more than £ 3.7billlion in a last ditch attempt to meet the target – which works out at around £ 60million every day for those two months			1
the @entity26 , which scrutinises government spending , warn that the strict target could leave civil servants ' feeling pressure ' to hand out money to projects which are not needed			1
in a report published today , they explain that a shortfall towards the end of the year ' constrained choice ' and meant officials ' could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013 '			2
' it may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending ' , they said			0
@entity18 did significant preparation work to deal with the increased budget , boosting its workforce , business processes and the ways in which it measures the benefits of aid , the report found			0
in the end , money which was intended to be given to international aid organisations in early 2014 for long - term projects was able to be brought forward and this was within the rules			2
the report found there was a major effort by @entity18 officials , under international development secretary @entity63 ( pictured ) , to increase their spending but the authors said : ' the need to hit a hard calendar year spending target could increase the risk of staff feeling pressure at year end to payments which are in advance of need			1
' the reasons for such payments should be properly documented and authorised			0
if payments are in advance of need , they are irregular and contrary to @entity79 rules '			0
in 2014 there was also a rush to spending £ 12billion by the end of year , with a last minute rise required when the economy grew faster than expected			0
a @entity18 spokesman said : ' in 2013 the @entity1 became the first @entity87 country to meet the @entity89 target to spend 0.7 per cent of @entity90 on @entity91			2
' investing in overseas development is creating a world that is healthier , more stable and increasingly prosperous and that is something @entity1 can be proud of			1
@entity1 aid goes only where it is most needed and where it will deliver the very best results for taxpayers ' money			2
' using available @entity90 estimates , @entity18 sets a clear strategy each year to deliver its @entity91 target and works with @entity79 to monitor and manage this through the year			0
it is normal practice and good financial management for organisations to take stock of priorities and emerging pressure through the year			0
' the nature of issues that dfid deals with , including humanitarian emergencies , means it is important to retain this flexibility			0
