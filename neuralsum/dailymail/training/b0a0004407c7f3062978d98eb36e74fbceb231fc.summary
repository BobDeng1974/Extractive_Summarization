by @entity0 @entity1 accused @entity2 of hypocrisy yesterday as he insisted the government still intended to reduce migration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ a year			1
the @entity8 party chairman denied the @entity10 leader ’s claim that his party had secretly dropped their pledge to reduce net migration less than 100,000			1
in an interview , he said the target ‘ remained party policy ’			2
last year net migration was 212,000			0
he accused the conservatives of failing to carry out basic border checks to make sure illegal immigrants and those overstaying on their visas were caught			1
and in a significant change of tone called for much tighter controls on immigration from new @entity40 states , saying people had lost faith in the government ’s assurances following the arrival of 60,000 @entity46 and @entity47			2
he suggested giving @entity40 member states the right to impose controls ‘ if people begin arriving in numbers too big for our society to absorb successfully ’			2
but mr @entity1 told @entity54 that it was mr @entity2 who had been standing in the way of the @entity56 taking action to rein in immigration			1
on the immigration target he said : ‘ it remains the policy , it has not changed			0
we do want to see immigration reduced to tens of thousands ’			0
accusations : the @entity8 chairman reacted by saying @entity2 gas blocked calls to rein in @entity40 migration he accused the @entity10 leader of performing a ‘ u turn ’ similar to the party ’s stance on tuition fees – which they pledged to abolish in opposition , but have now risen to £ 9,000 a year			1
the conservative party chairman said : ‘ the surprising thing about it is that he has never raised any of these concerns that i am aware of privately over the last few years			0
‘ what ’s more , he has actively blocked several of the common sense straightforward assessments ... he ’s stood in the way of those things happening - for example blocked our calls to rein in @entity40 migration			1
‘ it ’s very strange			0
you would have thought even in the background , in private you might have heard some of these things			0
i thought it was an extraordinary speech to make			0
