the prime minister is embarking on a two - day anti-independence tour of @entity1 following jitters in @entity11 about the state of the ‘ no ’ campaign ahead of the referendum taking place on september 18			1
speaking in @entity16 , he will declare : ‘ my message is simple			0
we want @entity1 to stay			0
’ mr @entity0 is playing ‘ good cop ’ to @entity20 ’s ‘ bad cop ’ – with the chancellor yesterday delivering the most explicit warning yet to @entity1 that they can only keep the pound if they vote to remain in the @entity25			1
he told voters in @entity1 : ‘ if it ai n’t broke , do n’t break it			2
’ mr @entity20 told @entity30 there were ‘ no ifs and no buts ’ and a @entity25 government led by whatever party would reject @entity1 first minister @entity35 ’s plan for a currency union if nationalists win the referendum			1
mr @entity20 told @entity30 that he , @entity41 , @entity43 ’s shadow chancellor , and @entity44 , the @entity45 chief secretary to the treasury , have ‘ all made it clear that there will not be a currency union if @entity1 becomes independent ’			1

sir @entity57 , the treasury permanent secretary , appearing before a @entity58 alongside the chancellor , warned that @entity1 interest rates could rise by up to 5 per cent if it refused to pay its share of the @entity25 ’s national debt as an independent nation			1
nationalists have suggested that an independent @entity1 might take this course if @entity11 refuses to let it keep on using the pound			2

whatever people thought of his policies , nobody could argue that he was a proud @entity76 who wanted the best for his country ‘ and why not ? he knew that loving your country and at the same time wanting to be part of something bigger does not make you any less @entity1			2
' that truth is shared by millions of others			0
so my message is simple			0
we want @entity1 to stay			0
we are all enriched by being together			0
@entity1 puts the great into @entity2			0
' together we are a @entity25 with a united future			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s visit comes amid growing signs of nervousness in @entity107 at the possibility of nationalists clinching victory			1
some recent polls have suggested that the ‘ yes ’ campaign is closing the gap , with significant numbers of voters in @entity1 yet to make up their minds			1
