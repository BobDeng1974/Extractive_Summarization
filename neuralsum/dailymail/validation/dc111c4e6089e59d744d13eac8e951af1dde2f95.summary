the @entity0 says president @entity1 will offer congratulations to @entity4 prime minister @entity3 following his come - from - behind election victory , but not until after a coalition government is formed ' days ' from now			1
the u-turn comes hours after @entity1 political strategy director @entity8 added fuel to @entity11 - @entity4 tensions by stopping short of congratulating @entity3 – and instead only patting @entity4 on the back for voting			1
' we want to congratulate the @entity4 people for the democratic process – for the election that they just engaged in , with all the parties that engaged in that election , ' @entity8 had said			1
aboard @entity22 , @entity0 press secretary @entity21 told reporters that @entity1 plans to call @entity3 ' in the coming days			1
' cold shoulder : the @entity1 administration initially offered congratulations only to the @entity4 people – for holding an election – and the president wo n't call @entity3 for days			1
the two leaders are pictured during an october 2014 meeting in the @entity31 @entity0 director of political strategy @entity8 said wednesday morning that the @entity0 would n't ' weigh in one way or another ' on @entity3 's crushing electoral win crushed it : @entity4 prime minister @entity3 's ruling @entity35 scored a resounding victory in the country 's election designated groveler ? secretary of state @entity40 was tapped to call @entity3 on behalf of the @entity0 – and made the call in the midst of nuclear negotiations with @entity4 enemy @entity45 the president 's past practice , @entity21 said , has been to wait until @entity4 's president formally asks @entity3 to form a coalition government			1
that , judging from history , could take about a week			0
@entity40 phoned him , @entity21 said , on behalf of the @entity53 – while he was in @entity54 negotiating with @entity45 over its nuclear ambitions			1
the @entity0 's chief spokesman also said the administration is ' deeply concerned ' about @entity59 rhetoric that the @entity3 campaign leveraged in its larger - than - expected win – and will make sure @entity3 hears about it			1
the rhetoric ' sought to marginalize @entity64 - @entity4 citizens , ' @entity21 said , according to a @entity0 pool report filed from @entity66 , @entity67			2
' the @entity11 and this administration is deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalize @entity64 - @entity4 citizens , ' he added			0
' it undermines the values and @entity72 ideals that have been important to our democracy and an important part of what binds the @entity11 and @entity4 together			0
' rhetoric that seeks to marginalize one segment of their population is deeply concerning and it is divisive and i can tell you that these are views the administration intends to communicate directly to the @entity4			0
' by the numbers : @entity3 's @entity35 party won 30 seats in the @entity4 @entity88 , enough to put together a ruling coalition of at least 61 seats by working with other right - wing and @entity92 parties like @entity93 and @entity94 @entity95 : supporters of @entity4 prime minister @entity3 celebrate as election results come in at his election campaign headquarters @entity1 drew fire two weeks ago for refusing to meet with @entity3 when he visited @entity100 for an historic speech to a joint meeting of @entity103 that was arranged behind his back			1
and conservatives howled when his former top campaign organizer , @entity106 , turned up in @entity107 as the leader of a group working to oust @entity3 – aided by a $ 350,000 @entity53 grant paid out last year			1
@entity3 was quick to condemn what he called funding ' from abroad ' of the group , called @entity113 , whose stated goal was to remove him from power			0
but when the dust settled , @entity3 's @entity35 party had won 30 seats in @entity4 's @entity88 , while its chief rival the @entity120 collected just 24			1
that result is strong enough for @entity3 to build a governing coalition with other right - wing and center - right parties – and remain as prime minister			1
the @entity0 has barely kept its dislike for @entity3 concealed in recent months			2
the @entity4 leader is among the world 's harshest critics of the administration 's efforts to negotiate a nuclear agreement with @entity45 , and it 's thought that @entity1 would have preferred to deal with @entity133 head @entity132			1
' we 're not going to weigh in one way or another , ' @entity8 told @entity137 after 99 per cent of the votes were counted , ' except to say that the @entity11 and @entity4 have a historic and close relationship and that will continue going forward			0
' trouble : @entity106 , the one - time director of @entity1 's electoral organizing campaign , worked to oust @entity3 thruogh a group that got $ 350,000 in @entity53 funds in 2014 @entity3 on top : the election was widely seen as a referendum on @entity3 , who has governed the country for the past six years			1
pictured are @entity3 supporters cheering as the results come in he wrote : ' @entity149 : a great victory for the @entity35			2
a major victory for the people of @entity4 ! ' @entity153 : @entity35 supporters react with joy after hearing exit poll results in @entity107 recent opinion polls indicated @entity3 was in trouble , giving @entity132 a slight lead			1
exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked but once the actual results came pouring in early wednesday , @entity35 soared forward			0
even before the final results were known , @entity3 declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly			2
' @entity167 , we achieved a great victory for the @entity35 , ' @entity3 told supporters at election night headquarters			2
' i am proud of the people of @entity4 , who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral , and to insist on what is important			0
' @entity132 said on wednesday he had spoken with @entity3 to congratulate him on his election victory			2
' a few minutes ago i spoke with prime minister @entity3 and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck , ' @entity132 told reporters			0
@entity183 : @entity120 supporters chant for victory			0
in the end their party won just 24 seats support : norris in his @entity191 video @entity3 received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star @entity195			2
in a @entity191 video called please vote for prime minister @entity3 , @entity195 said : ' i watched prime minister @entity3 's speech before @entity103 , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul			2
i also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the @entity4 people			0
' i have done three movies in @entity4 – " @entity213 " being my favorite – and i formed many friendships while there			0
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way			0
' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only @entity4 but also the @entity11			2
you see , we the @entity11 people need prime minister @entity3 as much as you do			0
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on @entity11 , too			0
' so i ask you , please , for the sake of @entity4 and the whole @entity233 , vote for prime minister @entity3 on @entity234			0
' he said his leftist @entity235 would continue to be an alternative to @entity3 's right - wing @entity35			1
@entity3 focused his campaign on security issues , while his opponents instead pledged to address the country 's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people			2
his return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for @entity233 peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the @entity11			0
@entity3 , who already has a testy relationship with president @entity1 , took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign , staking out a series of hard - line positions that will put him at odds with the international community			1
in a dramatic policy reversal , he said he now opposes the creation of a @entity263 state – a key policy goal of the @entity0 and the international community			0
he also promised to expand construction in @entity268 areas of @entity269 , the section of the city claimed by the @entity263 as their capital			0
@entity3 infuriated the @entity0 early this month when he delivered a speech to the @entity103 criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with @entity45			1
the speech was arranged with @entity276 leaders and not coordinated with the @entity0 ahead of time			0
in @entity100 , @entity0 spokesman @entity21 said @entity1 was confident strong @entity11 - @entity4 ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor			1
@entity3 will still need the support of @entity282 , whose upstart @entity284 party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread - and - butter economic issues			1
he is expected to become the country 's next finance minister .			0
