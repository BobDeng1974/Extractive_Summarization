by @entity0 misdiagnosed : @entity4 was thought to have asthma - the condition he was actually suffering from was n't discovered for 11 years struggling to climb stairs without becoming breathless , @entity4 could n't fathom how much his health had deteriorated since being diagnosed with asthma a decade earlier			1
despite previously enjoying an active social life , playing darts and supporting local cricket and football teams , now the slightest exertion left him gasping for breath , coughing , wheezing and lethargic			0
' at 39 , i was astonished when my gp told me i had asthma , but apparently you can develop it as an adult , ' says @entity4 , who lives with his wife , @entity21 , in @entity22 , @entity23			0
after his diagnosis in 1989 he was given a ventolin inhaler - or reliever - to ease his symptoms , which quickly relaxes the lung 's airways that can become inflamed and narrow in an asthma patient			1
this can be caused by an allergic trigger such as pollen or dust , or a non-allergic one such as exercise or cold weather			0
this causes symptoms such as breathing difficulties , coughing , wheeziness and tightness in the chest			0
but @entity4 found that the inhalers did not help enough , and after his diagnosis he frequently experienced attacks lasting for weeks , only clearing up with antibiotics			0
as the years went by he needed his ventolin up to nine times a day , causing heart palpitations , a common side - effect from over-use			1
he was given a different type of inhaler , but still needed this constantly , as well as using a steroid inhaler - or preventer - morning and night			2
' over the next few years my need for the inhaler grew , ' says grandad and father - of - two @entity4 , 62 , a former coal miner			2
being so breathless meant his confidence plummeted , making him almost housebound			0
' i panicked about going outside and crossing busy roads because i was having trouble breathing and could n't move quickly			0
' during bad spells he was also prescribed stronger steroid pills , which caused side - effects , including a swollen face and hunger			2
widespread : the condition affects 900,000 people in the @entity72 and is incurable , with an estimated 30,000 people dieing from it each year ' my wife became my carer , and my family were very scared watching me struggle to breathe , ' he says			1
' i did n't even want to get out of bed and go down stairs because i was worried about getting back up			0
' it was only then that @entity4 's consultant measured how well his lungs were functioning with a spirometer ( patients blow into the machine and it assesses the volume of air inhaled and exhaled )			0
patients with asthma will have normal lung function , unless they are experiencing symptoms or having an attack			2
@entity4 's poor results suggested , 11 years after his asthma diagnosis , that he did n't have asthma after all , which explained why he 'd found the condition impossible to control			0
his consultant realised he actually had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity101 ) , an umbrella term for a collection of conditions causing lung damage , including chronic bronchitis and emphysema ( in which the tiny air sacs , or alveoli , in the lungs are damaged )			1
the condition is incurable and affects 900,000 people in the @entity72 , usually above the age of 35 , and an estimated 30,000 people die from it each year			1
experts believe there are also more than two million undiagnosed cases			0
the condition is linked to smoking but it can also develop after long - term asthma			1
' we 're now finding childhood asthma is a risk factor for @entity101 , probably because it strikes during an important stage of development , so by the end of their teens asthmatics often do n't have as good a lung function as they should , and when lung function starts declining this can happen to them more quickly , ' says dr @entity131 , a consultant respiratory physician from @entity132			1
but because symptoms of copd and asthma are so similar , they are commonly confused by health professionals , he adds			0
after @entity4 was diagnosed with @entity101 , his medication was changed to a drug called @entity139 , which relaxes the airways for 24 hours with a single dose - working for longer than asthma medication			1
' it does n't work for everyone , but for me it 's been the best thing since sliced bread , ' he says			0
' it 's given me back my mobility and confidence , and i rarely need my inhaler			0
' big improvement : since treating his condition properly , @entity4 has regained his confidence and is comfortable getting around specialist advice is crucial when it comes to achieving an accurate diagnosis says dr @entity131 : ' gps need better awareness of these conditions			2
they both rank highly in hospital admissions , but if management is right early on , you can improve quality of life and possibly even life expectancy			0
' @entity167 , honorary chest physician at the @entity168 , @entity169 , adds : ' asthma patients usually have normal lung function , but when they experience asthma symptoms or an attack their airways go into spasm , becoming narrow and inflamed			2
' then , after taking medication - usually a ventolin inhaler - their lungs return to normal			2
' however , @entity101 patients have relatively fixed lung disease , so even on a good day they still have symptoms			1
most of the damage is n't reversible ( the airways do not widen and return to normal ) and progressively worsens			2
' one major consequence of misdiagnosis is that patients could be given the wrong medication			0
@entity101 patients usually start with bronchodilator inhalers to relieve narrowing of the airways and then go through a hierarchy of drugs , starting with shorter - acting medications and moving to longer - acting ones , as the disease worsens , says dr @entity131			1
' research has shown steroids can lead to an increased risk of pneumonia ( inflammation of lung tissue ) in @entity101 patients , so this is a risk if they are wrongly labelled as having asthma			1
' if the condition does n't improve , they can end up using a lot of steroids , which have side - effects such as weight gain , mood changes and osteoporosis ( weak bones			2
) but for asthma patients inhaled steroids are prescribed early to reduce inflammation in the airways			0
' if patients are told they have copd but it 's asthma and they do n't have inhaled steroids , they wo n't be able to control the disease - leaving them prone to worsening symptoms and even death from an asthma attack , ' says dr @entity167			1
' we see 1,100 asthma deaths a year in the @entity72 , often because they were n't on preventer treatments			1
' @entity101 sufferers should attend pulmonary rehabilitation courses , where they learn about the condition and receive individual exercise programmes - such as gentle walking and moving weights with their legs - which boosts their fitness and confidence , so without it they 'd miss out , says dr @entity167			1
for most asthma patients , using inhalers , not smoking and avoiding triggers means they can live a normal life , he says , so if someone 's ' asthma ' is uncontrollable , one reason could be because it 's @entity101			1
' doing allergy tests - because asthma patients often have allergies - could be beneficial , adds dr @entity131 , saying that advanced tests such as ct scanning can help by showing the lung damage associated with @entity101 , which can make diagnosis easier			1
' if i 'd had the right treatment and gone on a pulmonary rehabilitation course earlier i would n't have suffered during the years i went downhill , but i 've never been angry about my misdiagnosis , ' says @entity255 ' i 'm now involved with my @entity257 [ clinical commissioning group ] , sharing my experiences to ensure people with @entity101 receive the right help and to prevent this happening to someone else			1
