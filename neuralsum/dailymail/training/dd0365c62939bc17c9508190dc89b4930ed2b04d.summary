shocking details continued to emerge yesterday of the behaviour of @entity3 soldiers training in @entity4 as @entity5 insisted none of the cadets should be granted asylum here			1
tight security and armed military patrols were on duty last night at the @entity12 in @entity13 with an astonishing total of around 300 @entity4 soldiers in place			1
they massively outnumber the 236 remaining @entity3 , who are all due to go home tomorrow			1
five cadets are in police custody facing sex charges after a series of violations described by mr @entity5 as ‘ totally unacceptable ’			1
the head of the army today admitted the behaviour of @entity3 soldiers who went on the rampage outside their barracks was ' beyond the pale '			1
general sir @entity19 's remarks came after an angry @entity5 demanded military top brass explain the ' unacceptable ' breakdown of discipline which saw hundreds of @entity3 cadets sent home in disgrace amid allegations of rape , drunkenness , fighting and theft			1
the prime minister said the the @entity62 programme to train up @entity3 's army would be scrapped and all the trainees based in @entity4 deported			1
on their way home : 300 @entity3 troops training at @entity12 in @entity13 ( pictured ) have been sent back early following alleged sex attacks two thousand @entity3 cadets – hand - picked by the @entity70 – were supposed to be given leadership skills in the @entity4 to help their war - torn country			1
toppling @entity3 dictator @entity76 has allowed an ‘ even worse ’ regime to take over , @entity75 ’s @entity74 has claimed			1
mr @entity74 , the party ’s candidate in @entity79 and @entity80 in the upcoming by - election , said @entity76 had been good at controlling immigration			2
the former mp , who defected from the conservative party in september , said @entity87 migrants were being ‘ waved through @entity85 ’ and then headed for @entity88 to cross the @entity89			0
mr @entity74 was speaking at a public meeting in @entity79 , where @entity75 is hoping to win its second seat in the @entity92			0
the issue of immigration is becoming a key battleground for the @entity96			0
he said : ‘ whatever people say about @entity76 , one thing is he did n't allow those boats to come across			0
‘ he had an agreement with @entity85 that stopped it			0
since he 's gone we 've no idea what 's going on in @entity3 , it 's too dangerous for anyone to go there			1
’ he said that since @entity76 ’s regime had fallen the ‘ bad guys ’ were being replaced by ‘ even worse guys ’			0
he added : ‘ we bombed them , that 's what we did			0
that 's how this government helped @entity3			1
it got rid of somebody , albeit an @entity119 nationalist dictator , who actually gave a level of stability to the area			0
’ but the scheme has been beset by difficulties from the start - with trainees allowed to run amok outside their barracks in @entity13			2
at prime minister ’s questions today , mr @entity5 told mps what had happened at @entity132 , @entity13 , was ‘ completely unacceptable ’			0
he said : ‘ these are criminal actions and i ’ve asked fort the chief of the defence staff to look into this			0
’ mr @entity5 said the training had been scrapped altogether , adding : ‘ the trainees will be returning to @entity3 in the coming days			1
in the meantime all unescorted visits from the camp have been stopped altogether			0
’ since the training course began in june , @entity3 cadets hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night - while another two trainees have been charged with raping a man in a park			1
general discipline collapsed , with one in ten refusing to obey orders - with one @entity4 trainer reportedly headbutted and another apparently threatened by a @entity3 mob			1
general @entity19 told @entity20 the alleged attacks were ‘ completely beyond the pale ’ and ‘ absolutely regrettable ’ as he appeared before the commons defence select committee			1
but the chief of the general staff said : ‘ the @entity132 site is not a prison camp			2
it is extraordinarily difficult to control it , in that sense			0
’ he added that he knew some of the @entity3 had sought political asylum			1
asked if thought that was appropriate , he replied : ‘ no , probably not			0
’ to add further insult it has emerged that the @entity3 government still owe millions of pounds for the training of their soldiers			1
in april , mr @entity5 wrote to mr @entity171 ’s successor , @entity170 , urging him to make the payments			0
the prime minister pledged the @entity4 ’s continuing support but added : ‘ i understand that you have been working personally to take forward the @entity176 and that plans are now advanced for some 360 recruits to come to the @entity4 in may			1
‘ i hope that it will be possible to resolve quickly the remaining issues relating to contract and payment , given the overall importance of this programme to our shared goal of improving stability and security			2
’ the call for extra troops to restore order came from police last week			0
units of the @entity193 , the @entity193 , were sent in to @entity12 , near @entity194 , after their leave was cancelled			2
last night , the @entity196 announced the 24 - week course was ending early and the 325 cadets would be sent home			1
the future of the entire programme – scheduled to cover 2,000 trainees – is in doubt amid protests from furious locals			2
one of the @entity3 cadets due to be sent home blamed @entity4 yesterday for the difficulties at the @entity12 , claiming ‘ they did n’t tell us the difference between what ’s right and wrong here ’			1
@entity212 , who is not one of the men accused of the assaults , added : ‘ they did n’t tell us about @entity4 law			1
’ he alleged that when trainees had been allowed out on accompanied visits of three hours a week they had been offered drugs , alcohol and sex for money			2
he did not say who by			0
asked if the recruits had a message for the @entity4 government he said : ‘ not to take things too seriously			2
’ speaking to the @entity231 , mr @entity212 said he and other @entity3 were proud to have graduated from the course at @entity132 , and were very happy with the training they received			1
but some cadets were unhappy with life on the base and how they had been treated , claiming ‘ people ’ were out to ruin the reputation of the @entity3 army			1
mr @entity212 alleged that when the cadets were arrested and their comrades went to ask authorities at the base what was happening , they were given no information			2
he said the cadets believed the arrested men were ‘ unlawfully treated ’ , adding : ‘ we blame the @entity4 authorities			1
’ he admitted there had been a ‘ small fight ’ between cadets but far more between @entity3 and @entity4 soldiers			1
@entity254 , a former @entity255 health secretary who had initially supported the scheme , said : ‘ as this stands , no further groups of trainees could be brought here from @entity3			2
’ he said the @entity196 must be held accountable for ‘ a serious failure ’			0
mr @entity254 said about 10 per cent of the cadets ‘ were not accepting the discipline and were n’t accepting what they were asked to do and were not becoming part of a military force ’			2
‘ they were looking to take whatever advantage they could , ’ he added			0
‘ it has meant recently that there has been a lot of additional resources by the @entity196 to try and shore it up and give protection			0
it is all very disappointing			0
we wanted it to work and for it to make a contribution in @entity3			2
’ the demand for answers came after @entity35 magistrates were told how three of the cadets had behaved ‘ like a pack ’ as they hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night			1
@entity288 , 20 , and @entity289 , 27 , left their barracks on stolen bicycles and cycled to @entity35 where they stalked their victims under the cover of darkness			2
the city ’s magistrates were told how they touched them sexually and attempted to put their hands up their skirts			0
@entity288 pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault , one count of exposure and one count of theft			0
they will be sentenced at @entity308 at a later date			0
a third man , @entity310 , 18 , who was charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft , is yet to enter a plea			2
in another incident , @entity315 , 33 , and @entity316 , 22 , have been charged with the rape of a man in a @entity35 park			1
an estimated £ 2.5million was spent refurbishing @entity132 to host the series of courses conducted by members of 3 @entity193 , the @entity324			0
@entity325 , who chairs the parish council , said : ‘ i thought @entity327 did n’t drink but there has been a run on vodka in the local shop			0
that ’s their favourite trip – going to the @entity333 and then stealing bicycles			0
’ @entity335 confirmed that the @entity3 soldiers are eligible to seek asylum in the @entity4 before they are kicked out			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ asylum rules apply to everyone			0
