by @entity0 published : 23:50 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 9 august 2012 accused : @entity1 , 57 , pictured in 2009 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity4 a housemate of the victim testified on the sixth day of @entity1 's murder trial that former @entity10 policeman once broke into their shared home in @entity14 gear and threatened his ex-wife at knife point			1
' i could kill you and make it look like an accident , ' @entity17 reportedly testified wednesday of the words @entity1 related to @entity4 during that chilling episode in the long - running saga			2
only moments before rendering that crucial bit of testimony , @entity25 broke down in sobs on the stand - and had to be ushered out of court			1
meanwhile , judge @entity30 , handed the prosecution a key victory in allowing @entity25 's account of that fateful night , since it is hearsay - which is typically not admitted during trial proceedings			1
@entity25 never actually heard @entity1 articulate the knife - point threat to @entity37 , who was found dead in her bathtub in 2004 , but said that the victim told her about the incident after it occurred			1
@entity30 initially appeared as if he would bar jurors from hearing @entity25 's account , but then did an about - face , as the usually mild - mannered @entity47 state 's attorney prosecuting the case implored him to admit it			1
' this evidence should have life ! ' shouted @entity52 to the judge			0
the jury was not in the room at the time			0
earlier days : former @entity56 police sergeant @entity1 talks to the media as he leaves his home in @entity56 , @entity10 in 2007 another judge who had formerly heard portions of the case previously barred the same testimony from being admitted at trial			1
the ruling is especially important , as legal observers have long noted the dearth of actual physical evidence linking @entity1 to @entity37 's death , despite the preponderance of hearsay suggesting he did , indeed , kill her			1
defense attorneys tried gamely to rebound from the stunning ruling , which an obviously - thrilled @entity75 characterized to reporters after wednesday 's proceedings as , ' historical ' and a crossroads in the case			1
during cross-examination , defense attorney @entity80 raised his voice , pressing @entity25 repeatedly about why - if she now found aforementioned threat so unsettling - she did n't move out of @entity37 's house			2
you did n't move out , did you ? ... you did nothing ... because you did n't believe her , that 's why , ' the @entity90 reported @entity80 shouting over the objection of angry prosecutors			0
' sir , no one listened to @entity95 , ' @entity25 added later			0
meanwhile , retired @entity97 sergeant @entity96 told jurors he permitted @entity1 to sit in on his official interview of then - wife @entity100 - who notably provided the former policeman with an alibi for the day of @entity37 's death			1
@entity1 married @entity100 , who has also disappeared , after divorcing @entity37			1
. @entity96 said he made the unorthodox decision because @entity1 asked that he be allowed to do so as , ' a professional courtesy			1
' grave charges : @entity1 is accused of murdering @entity4 , left			0
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide the retired state policeman then regaled the jury with an account that overtly suggested the accused manipulated @entity118 's answers to his questions regarding where he was on the day of @entity37 's death			2
' ' he sat very close to @entity100 as we proceeded to ask questions , ' @entity96 recalled			0
' she was very distraught			0
' ' there was one particular question where he did have to refresh her memory , ' @entity96 recalled , according to the @entity128			0
' he leaned over to @entity100 and said , ' you remember what you cooked for breakfast			0
' he said , ' bacon ' or ' sausage ' and that was it			0
' missing : @entity1 , right , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity118 , right ' she became shaken and started to cry , ' @entity96 said			2
' and ( so ) we shut the interview down			0
' he said he did not interview her again			0
@entity118 , who police presume dead , initially provided @entity1 with an alibi , but later changed her tune to confide in friends that she believed her husband had , indeed , killed his third and former wife , @entity37			2
taken in : police lt. @entity25 , left , and a fellow investigator escort @entity1 , centre , into @entity148 state police headquarters in 2009 times past : @entity1 , pictured on his motorcycle two months before his indictment in 2009 , left , and right , with missing fourth wife @entity118 family : during the interview @entity1 claimed he was very close with his two children he had with his third wife , @entity37 : @entity155 and @entity156			2

victim 's housemate renders account of @entity1 's portentous threat , made at knife point to ex-wife after he broke into her home wearing @entity14 gear
judge allows jurors to hear crucial bit of hearsay , which had been barred by prior judge
prosecution hails ruling as ' historical ' and a crossroads in the case
policeman testifies he allowed @entity1 to sit in on the official interview of then - wife , @entity100 , and he seemed to manipulate her answers about his alibi
