the 29 - year - old mother of three is already wanted by @entity9 police over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country ’s coast			1
@entity87 : @entity5 from @entity73 , @entity74 , who converted to @entity77 age 17 , was married to @entity78 before he blew himself up in the july 7 terror attacks in @entity80 in 2005 , killing 26 now it is suspected that she was the mastermind behind the four - day gun and bomb attack on @entity92 in @entity31 , which has led to a continuing siege in which more than 60 people have lost their lives			1
however , @entity97 terrorist group @entity96 claimed today that no women were involved in the attack			0

read all about it : a @entity9 vendor sells a newspaper with an article on its front page about @entity5 's alleged involvement in the terror attack which began on saturday in @entity31 and has claimed more than 60 lives ' she was an average , @entity3 , young , ordinary girl			1
she had a very great personality			0
she did n’t have very good confidence , ' he said			0

mr @entity109 recalled a meeting with @entity5 and @entity135 regarding a housing issue which took place three or four weeks before the july 7 bombings , and he said she was just as he remembered her			1
' certainly when i was around her , she was the same person , lacking in confidence			0
' she was not strong - headed			2
and that ’s why i find it absolutely amazing that she is supposed to be the head of an international criminal terrorist organisation , ' he said			0
mr @entity109 said he was ' perplexed ' that someone he knew , who was so ' empty in confidence ' , was being linked to international terrorism			0
he said he prays that she is not involved , adding : ' ... and of course my worry is that if she in involved , is she under some kind of duress ? is there other factors involved ? ' or indeed , is it @entity5 ? i mean there are so many questions to be answered at the moment before one can make a view			1
' mr @entity109 said her family will be ' very upset ' if she is involved			0
' of course like anyone else , they will be very hurt , very upset , very , very upset , but i think they too will be waiting for proof , not speculation , ' he said			0
suspicion that @entity5 was in the attack in @entity31 were raised after the @entity9 foreign minister claimed that a @entity3 woman who has has allegedly been involved in terrorism ' many times before ' was among the militants			1
the @entity73 home of @entity16 , @entity5 's father : @entity5 was still at primary school when her family moved from @entity49 , @entity19 to to @entity73 in @entity74 @entity179 said the woman acted alongside ' two or three ' @entity181 as security forces began a fourth day of fighting at the shopping centre where at least six @entity3 are known to have died			1
a @entity3 policeman has testified in @entity9 in the trial of a @entity186 accused of plotting attacks and who has ties to @entity96 , the @entity97 group behind a weekend attack on the shopping mall			1
@entity192 ( pictured below today in court ) , of @entity80 , was arrested in december 2011 in a raid by @entity9 anti-terrorism police on his apartment in the @entity9 port city of @entity198 , along with a female accomplice , @entity199 , who police said was his wife			0
police said a third suspect , believed to be @entity5 , escaped in that raid			2
@entity192 and @entity199 face charges of being found in possession of explosive material recovered from their apartment , and a conspiracy to commit a felony , charges they both deny			0
@entity213 , a detective constable with @entity215 police , working in the forensic management team under the counter-terrorism command , told the court he had been part of a team deployed to assist @entity9 police			0
mr @entity213 said he and his team were told by @entity9 police that ‘ they were looking at a plot to detonate explosives in parts of @entity9			0
’ he said he had been informed that a @entity186 , @entity192 , had been arrested using a false @entity228 identity			0
the detectives were led to a government laboratory where they were conducting tests on chemicals recovered from @entity192 's apartment , mr @entity213 said			2
mr @entity213 , a bomb scene examiner , manager and counter-terrorism investigator , said the kind of chemicals found , if mixed for a short time , could make explosives that ‘ could detonate easily when exposed to shock or flame			0
’ earlier this month , @entity192 was acquitted by a @entity31 court of robbery with violence , charges that could have carried the death penalty , but remained in custody because of the trial in @entity198			0
prosecutor @entity248 said three detectives from @entity215 were among his witnesses			0
however there was confusion over ms @entity179 ’s comments - made while attending the @entity254 in @entity255 - with no confirmation either from the authorities in @entity31 or the @entity258 in @entity80			2
they directly contradict the @entity9 interior minister @entity260 who yesterday told a news conference that all the attackers were male - although he suggested that some may have been dressed as women			2
the @entity258 said only that it was aware of the foreign minister ’s comments			0
' we continue to liaise very closely with the @entity9 authorities and to support their investigation into this attack , ' a spokesman said			0
after her husband @entity135 detonated his suicide bomb at on a @entity276 line tube train between @entity278 and @entity279 stations in 2005 , @entity5 had told how she was horrified by the massacre			2
but the @entity281 - born @entity132 convert , who grew up in @entity283 , @entity284 , had never made a secret of his extremist views , alarming teachers by attempting to radicalise younger pupils			2
in 2009 @entity5 disappeared with her three children but resurfaced two years later after travelling to @entity9 on a false passport			2
the @entity9 authorities issued a photograph of a white woman in a veil who they said was wanted for questioning about a bomb factory in the coastal resort of @entity198			0
it is understood she has had little contact with relatives in @entity19 since her conversion to @entity77			0
mr @entity109 said he does not think the speculation surrounding @entity5 will cause divisions in @entity73 due to the community ’s maturity			1
' of course if it is @entity5 indeed , of course they ’ll be very hurt , very upset , as indeed any human being would be , but in terms of causing any differences in our community i think the community is far more mature for that kind of thing , ' he said			2
@entity319 , who was until recently the @entity321 's @entity320 , told @entity322 that any role @entity5 has with @entity324 militant group @entity96 is unclear			1
he said : ‘ @entity5 has obviously been involved in terrorism or connected with terrorists for some considerable time now			2
her role in @entity96 is very unclear or even if she has a role within ( it )			0
‘ she is currently wanted by the @entity9 authorities in relation to an investigation for those who have committed acts of terrorism			0
but as yet she is untried and unconvicted for those offences			0
‘ traditionally she would be seen to be somebody as a sympathiser , a facilitator or an instigator of terrorism			0
‘ she has certainly got a large media profile , certainly in the @entity3 media press in relation to her activities and her involvement in terrorist activities is still yet to be proven , but as i said she is still wanted for terrorist offences			2
