police officers could soon be equipped with watch computers , digital glasses and exoskeleton body suits under plans being examined by the @entity5			1
the government is looking into a number of ways in which the latest technology can help police maintain national security and catch criminals			2
among the gadgets being considered is the widespread use of body cameras and an ultra-light new graphene body armour , whose inventors won the @entity19			1
armed police have already been given the latest body armour and weapons , but it emerged today that officers could soon be given computer glasses and watches as well as super-light graphene vests @entity28 - style eyewear could allow police at busy events to have @entity30 flashed up in front of them , while officers responding to 999 calls could access @entity36 maps to work out possible escape routes			1
evidence gathered from cameras on bodysuits could also help to secure convictions and build a case against suspects			0
forces could also see the use of the exoskeleton suits also being examined by the @entity47 , which allows users to run faster and walk for longer periods			2
a version of the suit being developed by the @entity53 military allows soldiers to carry up to 200 pounds for more than 12 miles on a single battery charge			0
it also allows them to run at 7 mph for extended periods and even has a ' burst mode ' that takes the run into a 10 mph sprint for short periods			0
the plans for the new technology emerged as the @entity5 unveiled its new @entity65 ( @entity66 ) , where scientists will work on ways to better equip and arm police officers			1
from next month , the centre will work on ' developing the digital police officer ' , the @entity5 stated			2
it described the project as ' enabling officers to use technology such as body - worn video , wearable mobile data and head - up displays to improve information gathering and sharing '			2
among the gadgets being considered is greater use of body cameras fitted to officers helmets or vests exoskeleton suits like used being developed by the @entity53 military could also be used by police in future police forces could also use @entity28 - style eyewear to monitor @entity30 and the internet while on the beat it will also work on improving drug and explosive detection tools and finding ways of better tracking organised criminals using the internet			1
@entity98 , minister for organised crime , said : ' i ’m delighted to launch the @entity101 – a hub that allows government , industry , academia and of course practitioners , such as the police , to identify security challenges and create innovative solutions to tackle them			0
' we already have a strong and thriving security industry and i am committed to supporting it to ensure it stays at the forefront of the global market and at the same time contributes to the safety and security of the @entity120			0
' the technology being examined was revealed in a secret presentation given by the director of @entity5 's @entity124 , @entity125 , which emerged after a freedom of information request by the @entity127			0
but the prospect of even better equipped police officers has raised fears among some former officers			1
former police inspector @entity132 told the newspaper : ' there has been a problem , perhaps , with some forces in that they are beginning to look almost paramilitary			0
that , i think , is not conducive to good community engagement			0
' computer watches , like these being unveiled by @entity143 earlier this year , could also be given to police officers the @entity5 is examining whether graphene - a material which is 200 times stronger than steel and six times lighter - could be used in police body armour			1

@entity5 has launched new science and technology centre
they are looking into equipping police officers with latest gadgets
policemen and women could soon have computer - watches and glasses
they may also be handed graphene body armour and exoskeleton suits
former officer has raised fears technology is making police ' paramilitary '
