by @entity0 published : 16:42 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 04:36 est , 4 may 2013 @entity1 said the start of @entity4 's plays leave many pupils bored and ' gritting their teeth ' children should skip the ‘ slow ’ opening scenes of @entity4 ’s plays and go straight to the ‘ dramatic ’ parts in the middle , a teaching union leader has said			1
@entity1 , general secretary of the @entity12 , said the start of the @entity4 ’s plays left many pupils bored and ‘ gritting their teeth ’			1
instead , teachers should give children edited highlights of the best bits of his plays ‘ like a film trailer ’ to keep them interested , she said			1
her comments were attacked by educational campaigners , who accused her of ‘ promoting ignorance ’ and dumbing down			0
in the @entity27 , dr @entity1 wrote : ‘ the trouble with teaching @entity4 is not the distance between our contemporary use of language and @entity4 ’s @entity33			1
‘ nor is it the complex ( and often , frankly , ridiculous ) plots of his plays			0
no , the trouble with teaching @entity4 is that the @entity4 is given far too much respect			2
is it any wonder that so many students grit their teeth , learn the lines and , when the exam is over , remember @entity4 only as something that had to be endured in pursuit of an exam pass ? ’ dr @entity1 said @entity4 ’s genius lay in taking ‘ mundane , plodding material ’ and transforming it into compelling drama			1
‘ these tricks are used today in soap operas around the world , with their mix of high drama , tragedy and comedy , ’ she said			0
‘ students will approach @entity4 more confidently if they are able to make connections between what they already know and the unfamiliar world that they are about to enter			2
@entity1 suggested children should watch an edited highlights of @entity4 ' like a film trailer ' instead ‘ so do n’t start at the beginning			1
taking inspiration from film trailers , give novice @entity4 readers a taste of the most highly dramatic scenes in the play			2
’ @entity73 , chairman of the @entity74 , said dr @entity1 ’s position was ‘ incredible ’ and ‘ disturbing ’			2
he said : ‘ i think she ’s promoting ignorance and she ’s dumbing down			0
the whole point of studying drama and @entity4 included is that you understand the whole play , not just parts of it			0
‘ it ’s the computer games mentality that you only have what are seen to be action and excitement but @entity4 and most dramatists are about far more than that			0
but @entity89 , director of education at the @entity90 , said : ‘ we completely agree that the best way to introduce @entity4 to students is not necessarily to start them with @entity95 i. ‘ instead , we can ignite their curiosity about the characters and their dilemmas by using a particular moment as a starting point			0

@entity1 said many of @entity4 's plays left pupils bored
teachers should give children edited highlights instead ' like a film trailer '
campaign for @entity113 describe comments as ' disturbing '
