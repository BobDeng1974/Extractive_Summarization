by @entity1 reporter published : 03:57 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 24 august 2013 when @entity3 and @entity4 took new born baby @entity5 home from hospital back in 1995 they found themselves inundated with cards and gifts			1
one item that the proud parents found particularly touching was a circular silver balloon with a cute teddy bear printed on the front with the message : ' it 's a girl ! '			0
the balloon was carefully packed away in a toy box and stored in a cupboard along with the cards and gifts and was not opened until @entity5 reached her 18th birthday			1
then and now : @entity23 as a newborn baby with the balloon in 1995 ( left ) and celebrating her 18th birthday after discovering it was still fully inflated after all those years ( right ) by then the family had been through three house moves but incredibly when they opened the box they found the balloon had remained fully inflated			1
and when @entity5 was preparing to celebrate her big day @entity3 , 44 , and 43 - year - old @entity4 , who have a 10 year old son @entity34 , produced the balloon as a surprise at their home in @entity39 - along with a photo taken of the newborn @entity5 with the balloon			1
mrs @entity4 , who runs the family news agent business with her husband , said : ' @entity5 was born at @entity45 and obviously when we took her home there were loads of cards and presents			2
' my sister - in - law bought this lovely silver balloon on a stick and it was around for quite a while before we put all the stuff away in a cupboard			0
' it was put away in a toy box with all the other cards and things and just left there			0
we were n't particularly careful with it , we just threw it in with everything else			0
' but it must have been a good balloon because it survived all this time			0
when @entity34 came along we were rummaging around one day and he used it to play football in the house before it was put back in the cupboard			0
proud parents @entity3 and @entity4 pose with @entity5 and the balloon shortly after her 18th birthday			1
the family have been through three house moves since her birth but the balloon has remained inflated all that time ' i do n't think it was a helium balloon because it never floated up to the ceiling , but whatever is in it the balloon has kept its shape all these years			1
' when @entity5 was about to have her 18th birthday we got it out again and we found a picture of her with it when she was born			2
' it 's been a lovely thing to keep and it is still full inflated and hopefully we can keep it and if @entity5 ever has a little girl of her own it would be nice for her to have it			2
' @entity5 , who has spent the last two years at @entity96 and is due to study sport at @entity98 in september , said : ' it 's amazing that the balloon is still around and has n't gone down , we never expected it to survive for so long			0

@entity3 and @entity4 received the balloon on birth of daughter @entity5
they packed it away in a box which went through three house moves
and it was still inflated when they *unpacked* it on @entity5 's 18th birthday
