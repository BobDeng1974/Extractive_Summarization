by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 3 may 2013 senior judges are to ban the secret jailing of defendants for contempt of court , the @entity2 can reveal			1
the decision comes after emergency talks over the way a woman was given a prison sentence for trying to take her father out of a care home			2
@entity14 , 50 , was handed a five - month jail term by the @entity16 in her absence – and without being represented by a lawyer			1
shock : @entity14 , left , was jailed ' in secret ' by the @entity16 for trying to remove her father @entity20 , right , from a care home new instructions for judges will lay down that no one should be sentenced to prison for contempt of court behind closed doors			1
a judge ruled that @entity29 ’ efforts to remove her 80 - year - old father from the care home where she believed his life was in danger amounted to wilful defiance of the court			1
the sentence was imposed by judge @entity38 at the @entity16 in @entity39 without naming any of those involved			0
justice secretary @entity41 asked for a review into the dealings of the @entity16 following the @entity2 's highlighting of the @entity14 case no record of his ruling was published , and secrecy rules forbade anyone to name @entity29 , her father , the local council that asked for her to be imprisoned or the social worker who gave evidence against her			1
judge @entity38 opened his court to the public for the sentencing , but the unlocking of the courtroom doors was announced only to passers - by who happened to be in the corridor outside			2
the @entity2 ’s report of the @entity14 case provoked a major row over the @entity16 , which decides on the affairs of individuals too ill to make decisions for themselves			1
the court habitually sits in secret and few of its hearings have ever been subjected to public scrutiny			2
the depth of political concern became clear yesterday when it emerged that justice secretary @entity41 wrote to sir @entity73 , the judge in charge of family justice , to ask him to include the @entity16 in a review currently under way into the workings of the family courts			0
the family courts – which handle cases of divorce and child custody , and which rule when children are taken into care or put up for adoption – are rarely open to the public and usually publish only anonymous details of judgements			0
sir @entity73 is currently exploring ways to make them more open			0
the talks on the @entity14 case and secret imprisonment involved both sir @entity73 , who is head of the @entity95 of the @entity95 , and lord judge , the lord chief justice , who is the head of the judiciary			1
their decision to ban secret sentencing for contempt was taken before sir @entity73 received the @entity41 letter			2
lord judge , the lord chief justice ( left ) and sir @entity73 , the head of the @entity95 of the @entity95 ( right ) have decided to ban secret sentencing for contempt cases judge @entity38 sentenced @entity29 last august after hearing that she had repeatedly broken orders not to interfere with her father ’s life at the care home			1
he found she had helped take her father to a court hearing and had also taken him to see a solicitor ; that she had tried to publicise the case ; had left offensive messages for social workers ; and that she had given the 80 - year - old former painter and decorator a wooden cross to ward off evil at his care home			1
the judge said she had ‘ the attitude of someone who is simply not going to obey court orders ’			0
miss @entity14 was arrested 11 days after her sentencing by police and court officials who waited for her when she visited the care home			1
she has said she was assaulted in @entity134 in @entity135 by a fellow inmate who would not believe she had not committed a serious crime or had a public criminal trial			0
judge @entity38 , left , also imposed a suspended prison sentence on miss @entity14 ' brother @entity140 , right she served six weeks before being released after apologising to judge @entity38			2
the judge also imposed a two - month suspended sentence for contempt on @entity29 ’ brother @entity140 for his role in taking their father to a court hearing and to see a @entity39 lawyer			1
the suspended sentence , which was also imposed in secret , was handed down at a separate hearing in july			0
last week , after the @entity2 learned of the case , judge @entity38 agreed that @entity29 and her brother could be named , along with the council , @entity155			1
the judgment in which sentence was handed down was also published for the first time			0
@entity159 ’ father @entity20 died in january			0
miss @entity14 is thought to be the first person imprisoned by the @entity16			2
however no one can be certain because of the secrecy under which the court regularly works			0
family courts also have powers to sentence those who fail to obey court rulings with imprisonment			0
however the power is rarely used , not least because in family separation cases judges believe that to jail a mother who defies a court would harm her children			1
one notable recent case of a family court imprisonment involved fixer to the rich @entity177 , jailed for six months by a high court judge in january for persistent failure to account during his divorce case for the disappearance of his £ 400million fortune			1
the sentencing decision was made in open court			0
current civil procedure rules which govern the operation of the courts say that anyone sentenced to jail should be named			2
sir @entity73 yesterday replied to mr @entity41 to say he would consider the justice secretary ’s letter about the @entity16			0
sir @entity73 is expected to wait before sending a more detailed response .			0

new rules for judges after the @entity2 revealed @entity14 case
