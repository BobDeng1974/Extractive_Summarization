by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 14:52 est , 15 august 2012 two vast tent cities are to be set up on pacific islands to house the hundreds of asylum seekers expected to make their way to @entity5 in coming weeks			1
the decision to call in the troops to set up the canvas homes on @entity9 , off @entity10 , and on @entity12 island in the @entity13 came as the @entity5 parliament agreed today to stop boat people reaching the nation ’s shores on ill - equipped boats			1
@entity19 approved laws to bring into play off - shore processing of asylum seekers – and the legislation is expected to be passed by the @entity24 on thursday			0
outraged : supporters of the @entity26 protest outside @entity27 as they demonstrate against new legislation that will reopen offshore processing centres on @entity12 and @entity9 protest : speakers at the @entity26 protest use a megaphone to address the crowd the tents will house the asylum seekers until disused detention centres on the two islands , abandoned in 2008 , can be refurbished			1
once broken doors and fences have been repaired and air conditioning units installed , would - be migrants would be checked out in the what are currently run - down concrete structures before they could be considered to be suitable to live in @entity5			0
prime minister @entity44 said she had been advised that the troops would be able to set off for the islands almost immediately despite the unattractive prospect of living in tents for what will be weeks , asylum seekers waiting to board boats in @entity53 told local reporters today that they would still be prepared to risk their lives at sea for the chance of an eventual better life			1
it is expected that preparing the facilities to hold up to 2,100 asylum seekers will cost at least £ 350 million			0
before the tent cities plan was approved , the government had even considered loading asylum seekers onto hired ships – floating islands – until the detention centres could be repaired			2
the troops are expected to start the task of assessing the state of the detention centres on @entity9 – which was abandoned in 2004 – and on @entity12 , which was closed in 2008 , by the end of this week			1
@entity74 prime minister @entity44 said she had been advised that the troops would be able to set off for the islands almost immediately			2
she said @entity78 chief general @entity77 had told her that ‘ within a month we would hope to see people being processed in @entity12 and in @entity10 ( @entity10 )			0
’ she added that the temporary facilities would involve tents and ‘ other sorts of temporary structures ’			0
but immigration experts have told of their concerns about housing would - be migrants in tents , when there were problems such as riots in permanent detention centres on @entity5 territory			2
risky : a boat laden with refugees was driven onto rocks at @entity96 in december 2010 , killing many of those on board reduced to tears : asylum seekers from @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 had to be rescued after their wooden boat began to sink off the coast of @entity53 in april on @entity12 , local people have raided the abandoned detention centres and taken away air conditioners and other furnishings and in one case an entire hut has been broken down and carted off			1
after parliament passed the bill to allow offshore processing today , immigration minister @entity113 said this was not the end of efforts to deal with people smuggling			0
‘ this is not the end of the efforts to deal with what is the very , very , very , very pernicious trade of people smuggling , which trades on people ’s lives and gives people the expectation that in return for very significant sums of money they can be brought to @entity5 for passage			0

@entity9 , off @entity10 , and on @entity12 island in the @entity13 are both selected
the tents will house the asylum seekers until disused detention centres on the two islands , abandoned in 2008 , can be refurbished
@entity44 : advised that the troops would be able to set off for the islands almost immediately
