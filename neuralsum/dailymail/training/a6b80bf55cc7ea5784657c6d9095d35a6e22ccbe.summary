a former @entity1 employee named @entity2 has raised more than $ 2,500 for charity by auctioning off his old business card after an initial bid of $ 80,200 was revealed to be fake			1
mr @entity6 , 25 , worked for three years as a specialist at the @entity8 in @entity9 , where customers could n't help but notice his distinctive name on his @entity14 badge and employee t - shirt			1
when he left the store , he decided to set up an @entity18 auction to sell off of his old personalized business cards - with the money raised going to @entity22			2
novelty name : @entity2 , 25 , worked for three years at an @entity8 in @entity9 and auctioned off his business card for charity as the news of his coincidental name and charity auction spread across the world , the bids shot up to a staggering $ 80,200			1
however , they were later revealed to be fake - with mr @entity6 's card eventually selling for a lower sum of $ 2,653 , with the winner also receiving his old uniform and lanyard			2
but even though his donation to the charity is much less than he thought , he is still pleased with the money raised			2
he told @entity41 : ' i 'm so pleased at the amount that was raised and , according to @entity44 , anything over $ 2,000 is considered a major gift			2
so for me , that 's a major win and it will go towards granting a terminally ill child 's wish			0
' i do n't think we 're supposed to keep any of that stuff [ featured in the auction ] but working for @entity1 was honestly one of the funnest jobs i 've had , and i wanted to keep it as a memento			0
' good cause : mr @entity6 had hoped to raise up to $ 80,000 after receiving the bid on @entity18 , but it turned out to be fake in the post on the @entity18 page , where people were invited to bid , mr @entity6 posed next to his business card , which is framed alongside his employee t - shirt and @entity14 badge			1
he wrote that he came up with the idea after one of his old business cards fell out of a book			0
at first the auction created quite the buzz with bids rapidly flying up to $ 80,100 just few hours later , although this subsequently turned out to be a fake			1
hoax : the post on the @entity18 auction site for $ 80,000 , which turned out to be a fake mr @entity6 says he became interested in the @entity22 , which aids children with serious illness , after attending an inaugural gala last winter			1
since then , he has volunteered on numerous projects and made it his mission to help out			0
' @entity86 has clearly been touched by what we do and come up with a creative way to support us , ' said @entity90 , the director of the charity 's @entity92 branch			0
' one of our recent wish children , who sadly passed away just after his travel wish , summed up his experience so profoundly by saying " i forgot i was sick , " ' explained the charity director			0
' @entity86 has made a choice to help us give another child and their family this gift			0
