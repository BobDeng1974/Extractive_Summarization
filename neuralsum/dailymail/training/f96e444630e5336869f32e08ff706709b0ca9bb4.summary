a look back at 1991 from a football perspective conjures up memories which give a stern reminder of just how much football really has moved on			0
( sir ) @entity5 still had n’t won a league title with @entity7 , the class of ’ 92 were still yet to rip through the youth level of the game and the @entity11 did n’t exist			1
in addition , an @entity13 manager was about to win the top flight title with a now second tier club and even the @entity13 team were actually rather good			2
@entity18 train on wednesday night ahead of their @entity20 clash with @entity21 @entity18 manager @entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 speak to the media another to add to that list is that @entity26 lifted the @entity27 for @entity18 to mark a record eighth win for the club in the competition			1
back then , @entity18 were a cup team – a very good one at that			1
but while the game has moved on , @entity18 ’s trophy cabinet really has n’t kept up			2
in the previous 24 years to the @entity35 win over @entity36 , @entity18 won three @entity37 , two @entity38 as well as two league cups			1
since defeating @entity42 ’s side , it ’s been just the two league cups added to the @entity45 trophy cabinet			1
sadly for @entity18 fans , it ’s not because overall league form has improved in the form of consistent title challenges			1
since 1991 , @entity18 have never finished higher than fourth			1
in the previous 24 years they did it five times			0
their proud cup record has too faded in that time with @entity7 and arch rivals @entity55 both now having won the @entity27 11 times			2
@entity18 captain @entity26 holds the @entity27 aloft after beating @entity36 in the 1991 final this is not to say @entity18 are an underachieving club			1
in the financial and stadium stakes , there are at least five teams bigger in the @entity11			2
for the club to have reached the top four twice in the last five years while being among the lowest net spenders in the division shows just how competitive they have been			0
the 2010/11 @entity66 season will fondly be remembered for @entity68 ’s hat - trick at @entity69 , @entity71 ’s winner at @entity72 and nights where the club went toe - to - toe with @entity75 in a quarter - final			0
except the last one on that list did n’t end too happily , because that ’s where their @entity66 dream came to a rather humiliating end in a 5 - 0 aggregate defeat			0
@entity68 scores one of his three goals against @entity69 in the @entity66 in october 2010 here is @entity18 ’s problem			2
they are now happy to make up the numbers and go on reasonable cup runs before letting elite teams grab success			0
in cup terms , these top sides should be dreading @entity18			2
arguably the @entity11 aside , they are good enough to win any other competition they enter			1
@entity94 and @entity95 are just a couple of recent teams who prove you do n’t need the best squad to taste glory			0
in fact , a quick glance at this season ’s @entity20 makes them the bookies ’ favourites to win the competition			1
unusual considering the club have n’t stepped foot in a @entity111 semi-final since winning the competition 30 years ago			0
even @entity113 and @entity114 have reached the final in the last decade			0
fans can often be split on whether they would rather reach the @entity11 top four or win the @entity20 , but with the @entity20 now the gateway to the @entity66 for the first time this season , there ’s no reason why @entity18 ca n’t have their cake and eat it			1
@entity18 prepare for thursday night 's @entity20 clash at the @entity125 spurs have a no worse chance of winning the @entity20 than they do of reaching the top four – and the advantage of the former is a famous cup win in addition to gate - crashing @entity134 ’s elite			1
the new rule in place for this season onwards was made for clubs like @entity18			2
it ’s the perfect carrot to dangle for the north @entity140 side – especially if their domestic form stutters			0
the road to the final in @entity145 may seem a long one , compared to short trips around @entity13 ( and the odd visit to @entity149 ) in the top flight , but it could be a more memorable one			0
@entity21 and @entity152 will provide fair competition in a group also featuring @entity155 , but it admittedly would be a surprise should the north @entity140 side fail to progress			1
not noted however , especially in early less glamorous ties of the competition , is just how tough the tournament is to win			0
@entity23 stretches during a training session at the @entity125 on wednesday night already in this year ’s @entity20 are @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity69 and holders @entity164 who would n’t look out of place on a @entity66 night			0
with group stage drop - outs from @entity20 ’s premier competition to enter the knockout round of the last 32 , the tournament ’s strength suddenly stands out			1
but this should n’t be a reason why @entity18 should put the competition on the back - burner			2
on the contrary , it should be a reason to embrace it			0
@entity178 celebrates with the trophy after @entity18 won the @entity20 in 1984 @entity18 ’s @entity20 wins in 1972 and 1984 are among the club ’s most memorable nights , but with such few @entity111 memories since then , it ’s time for @entity18 to prove to the continent they are capable of bringing the ‘ glory , glory nights ’ back to @entity45 – as well as a cup win			1
when @entity18 kick - off at @entity21 at 6pm on thursday , supporters should be watching @entity189 believing that for the first time in a long time , @entity18 are in it to win it			1
after all , it was 1961 double winning captain @entity194 who proclaimed ‘ the game is about glory ’			0
