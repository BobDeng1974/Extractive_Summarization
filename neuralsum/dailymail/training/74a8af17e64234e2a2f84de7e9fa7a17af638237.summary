@entity0 has felt all year that something special was going to happen			1
for now , he 'll take his lowest round of the season			2
@entity0 took only 21 putts and made birdie on half of his holes on friday at the @entity7 , giving him an eight - under - par round of 63 and a two - shot lead over @entity10 after the opening round of the @entity12			1
' it was one of my best ones of the year , for sure , ' @entity0 said			1
form : @entity16 @entity0 leads the @entity12 by two shots after a round of 63 snapping at the heels : compatriot @entity10 is just two shots further back after an opening 65 he did n't miss a putt inside 15 feet and closed out his round with a pitching wedge to 18 feet , making the downhill putt for his ninth birdie			1
@entity10 matched his low round of the season , though what meant more was the timing			1
this is the final week before @entity16 captain @entity32 decides which three players he will pick to fill out his @entity35 team			1
@entity10 always seemed like a logical choice , though he wants to leave nothing to chance			1
he played bogey - free in a gentle breeze , and it was just the start he needed			2
' i 'm not going to sit up here and say any cliches that i 'm not thinking about the @entity35 or any of that , ' @entity10 said			1
' i am very aware every second of the day that i 'm being watched by the captain			2
and i 'm just trying to embrace that be aware of it and enjoy it if i can			0
' @entity50 , who also needs a pick to return to the @entity35 , and @entity52 of @entity53 were among those at 66			1
@entity55 recovered from a double bogey to start his round and , with his entire family in tow , turned it around with four birdies and an eagle for a 67			1
also at 67 was @entity63 , who seems certain to be a @entity35 pick for @entity65 on tuesday considering how much damage he 's done to the @entity16 in the competition			1
@entity63 was thinking only about his golf , which has n't been very good this year			2
mixed : world number one @entity69 was brilliant at times and dreadful at others as he shot an opening 70 frustration : @entity69 had to endure a round of brilliant birdies as well as frustrating bogies on the course ' i just want to play golf , ' @entity63 said			1
' it 's been a ( bad ) year , and i want to turn it around right now			2
' @entity69 was brilliant at times and sloppy at other times in his round of 70			1
he was n't sure what to expect and even @entity85 had to be surprised by his card that featured six pars , six birdies , four bogeys , a double bogey and a triple bogey			0
' i said it would be feast or famine , ' @entity85 said			0
' i was hoping it would be stableford			0
if it was @entity99 , i 'd be right in it			0
' instead , he needs a good round saturday to make sure he stays in the top 70 in the @entity103 to advance next week to the third playoff event in @entity105			1
for two weeks - especially this one - the @entity103 shares the stage for that other cup			0
so many players are thinking less about the chase for a Â£ 7.6million bonus , and more about a chance to play a tournament where they do n't get paid at all			0
@entity32 and @entity65 captain @entity114 announce their three picks tuesday			1
this is the final qualifying week for @entity65 , though only the players competing in @entity119 this week can affect the standings			1
on the up : @entity63 shot a decent four - under - par round as he looks to sew up a @entity35 wildcard pick @entity0 finished no. 18 in the @entity35 standings			1
his name has n't been mentioned as prominently as others bidding for captain 's pick			2
but he looked plenty good friday			0
' i keep telling myself something is going to happen			0
i do n't know where or when , ' @entity0 said			2
' my game has been in good shape			0
it was a matter of getting it all together			0
' his regular caddie , @entity136 , did n't make the trip			0
@entity136 is close friends with @entity140 , who works for @entity141			0
@entity140 's wife died of a seizure tuesday in @entity144 , and caddies and some players wore a black hat with an orange ribbon as a tribute to @entity150			2
the couple has a 4 - year - old daughter			0
' when he said , ` i may need to stay home , ' i said , ` done			0
we 're just playing golf , '' @entity0 said			2
@entity10 won all three of his matches with @entity85 in the last @entity35 at @entity159 and is desperate to be on the @entity16 team that will try to win the cup back on sept. 26 - 28 at @entity162 in @entity163			1
and he 's not shy about saying so			0
' when i wake up , i 'm thinking about it			0
when i 'm on the course , i 'm thinking about it , ' he said			0
@entity10 was never in big trouble			2
he drove it long and straight , and that goes a long way on the @entity7			0
@entity10 played with @entity85 in three matches at @entity159 in the last @entity35 , and they never lost			1
@entity10 also played a practice round at @entity162 with @entity32 before the @entity173			1
' i think if i go out and shoot good scores , yeah , i think i 'm in good shape , ' @entity10 said			2
' but there 's so many great players that are n't on this team			0
i do n't take anything for granted			0
i do n't think i 'm a lock by any means			0
' decision time : @entity65 team captain @entity114 must name his three @entity35 wildcards on tuesday			1

@entity0 shot an eight - under - par round of 63 to take a two - shot lead
@entity10 is in second place at the @entity12
final week before @entity32 decides his three @entity35 wildcards
@entity50 and @entity52 are a shot further back than @entity10
