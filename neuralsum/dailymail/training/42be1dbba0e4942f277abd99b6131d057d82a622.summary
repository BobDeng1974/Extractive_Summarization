the @entity1 administration should ban all air travel to the @entity3 from the three @entity5 countries hardest hit by the @entity7 epidemic , say at least 41 members of @entity9 including three @entity12 @entity11 members			1
@entity13 senator @entity13 , whose home state is ground zero for @entity7 in @entity15 , wrote wednesday in a @entity16 op - ed that ' we all very much hope the virus will not spread any further in @entity20			1
but hope is not a strategy			0
' ' given the gravity of the threat , common sense dictates that it ’s time to ban flights from the countries afflicted by @entity7			0
' ' there 's no reason to allow ongoing commercial air traffic out of those countries , ' he told the @entity34			0
both men have called for a commercial air traffic ban between the @entity3 and the three @entity5 nations where @entity7 rages out of control			1
' i have no confidence in how the @entity52 is managing the @entity7 crisis , and neither do the people of @entity45 , ' @entity44 said oct. 14 only a drill : hazmat suits like these could become commonplace at @entity3 airports if @entity7 spreads without end rep. @entity60 , a @entity61 @entity13 , said in a statement that the @entity3 is ' faced with the growing threat of a disease for which there is no known reliable cure , and we know where it ’s coming from			1
why would we not act in every way possible to stop it from reaching us ? ' that sentiment is 180 degrees opposition from the @entity11 's point of view , producing a clash that has @entity75 insiders scratching their heads			2
a group of 26 @entity11 members , including @entity12 @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , wrote to @entity1 on oct. 8 that ' the @entity3 needs to institute travel restrictions , enhanced airport screening and possible quarantine of individuals who have traveled to , or from ' @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			1
house speaker @entity37 joined that group on wednesday after the chief @entity11 spokesman said a travel ban is not under consideration			1
' a temporary ban on travel to the @entity3 from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider , ' he said , ' along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow			1
' the @entity11 is nowhere near considering restrictions on commercial airline flights from the ebola hot zone to major @entity3 airports			1
instead , it has ramped up disease surveillance at the five airports that handle about 94 per cent of the passenger load from the hardest hit @entity5 nations			1
the extra screening – carried out by @entity113 and @entity114 officers , not health care professionals – have begun at @entity118 's @entity117 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity123 @entity123 airports			0
@entity1 did not address the possibility of a travel ban during his remarks after a two - hour emergency cabinet meeting wednesday afternoon			1
not going to happen : @entity128 , @entity129 urgency : @entity1 skipped his planned political fundraising in order to chair a cabinet meeting about his administration 's @entity7 response the president canceled planned political campaign appearances in @entity138 and @entity139 to call the meeting			2
the @entity11 said late wednesday that presidential campaign trips to @entity118 and @entity142 had been called off for thursday as well			2
but hours before the president spoke , @entity11 press secretary @entity129 reiterated that banning @entity15 - bound flights from ebola - ravaged countries ' is not on the table			2
' @entity147 @entity12 republicans @entity149 republicans ' it 's important for people to understand exactly why that 's the case , ' @entity129 said			0
' shutting down travel to that area of the world would prevent the expeditious flow of personnel and equipment into the region			0
' ' and the only way for us to stop this outbreak , and to eliminate any risk from @entity7 to the @entity3 public , is to stop this outbreak at the source			2
' @entity129 and @entity169 chief @entity168 have emphasized that isolating entire countries would make it harder , not easier , to contain the spread of @entity7			0
at the same time , the @entity169 has tried to isolate individual @entity3 who have come into contact with @entity7 - infected people			2
@entity129 added that the administration is already ' mobilizing significant resources to make sure that supplies and personnel can get to the affected region			2
' @entity180 asked the @entity11 why military aircraft could n't be used for the same purpose without putting civilians ' health at risk , but no response has come			1
a survey of online airfare booking websites including @entity189 and @entity190 found that domestic @entity3 airlines are no longer flying between @entity3 airports and the @entity86 capital of @entity194 – the epicenter of the @entity7 outbreak			1
but several foreign - owned airlines fly those routes every day , including @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity202 carrier @entity201			2
that , says @entity203 @entity13 rep. @entity13 , should stop			0
' allowing people to come from outbreak areas into the @entity3 threatens the lives and health of @entity3 citizens , ' he told the @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity203 , on oct. 12			0
' it ’s crazy and irresponsible			0
' two - thirds of @entity3 agree , according to a @entity215 / @entity214 poll released tuesday			0
fully 67 per cent told pollsters they would agree with ' restricting entry to the @entity3 by people who 've been in affected countries			0
' just 29 percent lined up against the idea			0
@entity20 rep. @entity221 said last week during a congressional field hearing in @entity223 that the @entity1 administration is ' almost guaranteeing mathematically we 're going to miss some people ' with airport screening alone			1
' if we were really treating this as a public health issue why would we not immediately stop these flights ? ' he asked			0
others in @entity9 are asking the @entity232 to suspend the 13,000 travel visas issued to foreign nationals from the three countries that have been hardest hit			0
that 's a position shared by @entity238 chairman @entity237 , @entity240 chairman @entity239 and at least five other @entity11 members			1
most democrats in @entity9 share the @entity11 's view , however , including @entity246 rep @entity244			1
she downplayed the health risks from @entity7 in the @entity3 , complaining in a statement wednesday that ' many of my congressional colleagues have let their anxiety about this crisis dictate a panicked and perilous tone during a time when we need a cautious yet vigilant discussion			0
