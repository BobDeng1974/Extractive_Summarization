the boss of @entity1 has been accused of blackmail after warning of blackouts following a decision to launch an inquiry into the energy market			1
@entity7 , the chief executive of @entity1 , which owns @entity9 ’s biggest energy firm , said the industry was likely to stop building power stations , and the gap between the demand for electricity and supply will narrow to the point where the country ’s lights might go out			1
industry watchdog @entity19 said yesterday it was referring the energy market to the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) for investigation			1
@entity7 , the boss of @entity1 has been accused of blackmail after warning of blackouts following a decision to launch an inquiry into the energy market the combined annual profits from the @entity29 companies @entity1 boss @entity7 energy chiefs have drawn flak for pocketing six - and seven - figure pay packets while thousands of people are forced to choose between eating and heating			1
yesterday @entity1 owner @entity1 said its top team shared a pool worth £ 7.1 million last year			1
chief executive @entity7 received £ 2.2 million during 2013 – and would have got significantly more if the company ’s share price had not collapsed in the last six months			2
the previous year he collected a raft of pay and perks worth a total of £ 5.7 million			0
@entity45 boss @entity44 was paid £ 1.8 million last year , while @entity47 chief dr @entity46 received a package worth £ 1.3 million during 2012 , the last year for which figures are available			1
@entity52 ’s @entity9 chief executive @entity51 was paid £ 1 million in 2012 , while @entity54 chief @entity53 received £ 500,000			0
@entity56 boss @entity55 , who only took over last year and has refused to give up his bonus , is expected to be paid £ 750,000 for 2013			2
it has found ‘ possible tacit co-ordination ’ on prices , with the ‘ @entity29 ’ firms apparently moving tariffs up and down at the same time			1
specifically , there is new evidence that they are quick to raise prices when costs rise but slow to reduce them			0
wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months , but the @entity29 – @entity1 , @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity56 , @entity54 and @entity52 – are delaying passing this on			1
soaring : this graph shows how average energy bills have risen over the past few years static : fewer people switch energy suppliers after apparently giving up hope of getting a better deal supplies : energy prices have risen beyond inflation as the profits of the @entity29 have climbed upwards the watchdog said the firms were also penalising long - serving customers by routinely charging them higher tariffs			1
@entity19 said : ‘ profit increases and recent price rises have intensified public distrust of suppliers and highlight the need for a market investigation to clear the air			1
’ the @entity21 could decide to break up the @entity29 , with power generation and supply separated from the business that sells electricity and gas to the public			1
but mr @entity7 set a bomb under the process by suggesting the inquiry , which will take two years , could have disastrous consequences			2
he said energy firms were likely to delay investing in new power stations if there was a risk of the firms being split			1
@entity19 has already forecast that spare electricity capacity – the difference between power station output and peak demand – could fall as low as 2 per cent by 2015 - 16			1
asked if that situation would now worsen , mr @entity7 said : ‘ it ’s just become more difficult , clearly , because we ’re now going to have to wait until we see the outcome of this review			0
’ the lack of meaningful competition means many families and pensioners are paying as much as £ 250 a year too much			0
yet between 2009 and 2012 , energy firm profits rose 410 per cent to nearly £ 1.2billion – as bills increased by 12.5 per cent			1
energy secretary @entity123 dismissed the blackout warnings as ‘ absolutely and utterly wrong ’			2
‘ the lights will stay on , ’ he said			0
‘ we are seeing record levels of investment in energy			2
@entity131 generators are coming in			0
’ he insisted that while @entity1 may cut back on building power stations , there were plenty of firms willing to fill the void			1
@entity19 director @entity137 warned of a new aggressive regime of fines if firms failed @entity141 said : ‘ we are disturbed by the rising level of profit			1
if competition is working effectively it should be pushing profit margins down and forcing efficiency improvements			0
’ @entity147 , a @entity149 mp and member of the @entity152 energy select committee , added : ‘ scare stories from people like @entity7 are simply untrue			2
’ @entity156 will say in a speech today that high energy costs ‘ stifle ’ small firms on which the economic recovery depends			2
he will say family businesses have lost out from this week ’s price freeze by @entity45 , which is only for households			1
and firms do not have the same protection from rogue practices as domestic customers			2
if @entity149 wins the next election , it will set up a new energy regulator which would ban suppliers from rolling customers on to more expensive tariffs without their consent			1
1 ) regular meter readings			0
make sure you check every time you receive a bill , rather than relying on an estimate by your energy provider 's estimate			2
2 ) change to online bills			0
you could save up to 10 per cent			0
3 ) avoid prepayment meters if you can , and swap to a billed meter			0
even if you have to pay to get one , it 's probably worth it for the savings you 'll gain			0
4 ) if you 're in financial trouble some companies offer special deals , which help ease any difficulties you might be facing			0
but do n't just assume this will be the cheapest option - make sure you still do your homework			0
5 ) dual fuel ( gas and electricity from the same supplier ) is not always the cheapest option			0
6 ) monthly direct debit payments could save you five to 10 per cent as companies are more confident that customers wo n't default and earn interest on any overpayments			0
check any extra payments are refunded at the end of the year			0
7 ) move beyond the @entity29			1
some of the best tariffs are now offered by smaller providers such as @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			0
in a recent survey , @entity214 and @entity215 topped the table for best service with 82 per cent customer satisfaction .			0
