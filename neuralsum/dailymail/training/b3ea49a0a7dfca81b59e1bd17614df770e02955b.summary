by @entity0 snowfall expected in @entity2 tonight could help push @entity3 over the all - time record despite spring - like temperatures that neared @entity6 as late as 11pm sunday			1
if more than 1.9 inches drifts down over the @entity3 before winter finally releases its icy grip , snowfall will exceed the 93.6 inch record set in 1880			1
some forecasts predicted up to three inches monday night			0
while much of the @entity11 reveled in summer - like temperatures monday , even those were expected to fade into renewed wintery chills by tuesday			1
say it ai n't so : deeply winter - weary @entity3 will again see temperatures plummet monday and the state 's even poised to break an over 130 - year - old yearlong snowfall record record - breaking : a january photo show 's @entity2 blanketed in the white stuff , a site that became all too familiar to @entity20 this year			2
if @entity2 sees over 1.9 inches monday , the state will beat record of 93.6 inches set way back in 1880 the dramatic step back into winter was prefaced by a barrage of soaking rains sweeping towards the east where the incoming cold front clashed with the outgoing warmth			1
according to @entity31 , the chances of @entity3 breaking its 130 - year - old snowfall record are low but not out of the question			2
on sunday , the same storm system dumped six inches of snow onto @entity35			0
as the cold air pushes onward , the @entity36 who enjoyed temperatures in the 70s on monday mercury could dip below freezing overnight tuesday across the @entity42 , the @entity43 and into the northeast just to the cusp of the @entity47 corridor			0
only southern @entity48 can expect to be spared from what is hopefully one of this record - shattering winter 's last stands			0
why ? the dramatic shift back into winter has already dumped 6 inches of snow on @entity35 and was poised to chill nearly all the @entity36 save for @entity48 after a barrage of showers and severe thunderstorms			0

the @entity2 saw temperatures in the high *60s* on sunday but expects *flooding* rains followed by snow tonight
a snowfall over 1.9 would put @entity3 over the 93.6 inches record set in 1880
meanwhile , the @entity11 is experiencing summer - like temperatures , but only until tuesday when the mercury will dip below freezing in some places
