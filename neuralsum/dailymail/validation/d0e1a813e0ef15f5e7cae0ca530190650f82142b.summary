@entity0 dedicated his third @entity2 goal to @entity3 – the day after the @entity5 and @entity6 legend was laid to rest			1
@entity0 came through the ranks at @entity8 where the legendary midfielder ruled supreme in the late 1950s			1
@entity10 paid tribute to @entity3 with a minute 's applause before wednesday night 's game with @entity14 - and @entity15 defender @entity0 , who replaced @entity16 at the break , ensured the night also had a fitting ending by heading home a winner with five minutes remaining			1
@entity0 gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for @entity2 @entity0 celebrates his late goal , which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity the @entity15 centre back celebrates with his team - mates after securing the win five minutes from time ' i met him a couple of times when i was at @entity5 , ' @entity0 recalled of @entity3			1
' he was a confident person			2
i think it was the way he played , he was n't shy and had a great career with @entity2 , @entity5 and @entity6			1
' a great deal of respect has been shown to him in football , especially @entity43 football			2
' so i 'm especially pleased i scored tonight			2
he was strong and could bully people and was a player people could relate to			2
he had a great career and that minute 's applause was great for him and his family			1
' it was good to get a goal			1
that was my first @entity2 appearance in a long time and it meant a lot to get 45 minutes			1
to also score a goal was even better			1
' i 'd almost scored from a corner five minutes before the goal when i had a header at the front post			1
i maybe should have done better			2
' i said to @entity62 ( @entity63 ) to hang it up a bit and it was there to go and attack			2
i stuck my head on it and thankfully it went into the back of the net			2
the teams observed a minute 's applause for the late @entity74 before the game at @entity10 ' it 's my third goal for @entity2 and my sixth of the season			1
as a defender , it ' s good to add goals to my name			2
' despite heading his second career goal against @entity14 , @entity0 believes he will return to the bench when @entity85 come calling on sunday			1
' obviously i am down the pecking order , ' he added			2
' i just have to be patient and play well for my club and hopefully my international chance will come again			2
' until @entity0 's late intervention , it was a night of missed opportunities in more ways than one			1
@entity97 , without an international goal since his one and only strike against @entity95 almost six years ago , saw a couple of decent chances come and go			1
had the occasion been anything other than a friendly , he would have been beating himself up about it			2
but perhaps the prospect of what should be a turkey shoot against @entity85 on sunday allowed him a degree of comfort			0
' i 'm looking to get back on the score sheet as soon as possible , ' he said			0
' it ' s been a while			0
for me , tonight was just about getting some minutes under my belt			0
' i 've not played too much this year so it feels good to get back out there			0
it does n't prey on my mind			0
if i was n't getting chances , i 'd be complaining but i ' m getting them so i just need to start taking them			0
' crowds clap whilst the hearse carrying the coffin of @entity3 leaves @entity122 for his funeral asked if becoming the first @entity2 player since @entity125 to net a hat - trick come the weekend was an added incentive , @entity97 quipped : ' i need to get a goal just now never mind a hat - trick			1
listen , if we get the opportunities hopefully we can take them			0
' if that means one of us getting a few then great			0
first and foremost , we just want to get the goals that give us a win and push up the table			0
' so much for two @entity137 nations nipping the life out of each other as they sought a miniscule psychological edge to take into their remaining @entity142 qualifiers			0
@entity143 was what it said on the ticket and , by heavens that is what we got			0
at the conclusion of a remarkably featureless and benign game it was tempting to ask if much had been gained from it			0
but , despite the lack of goals , @entity97 believed it was the perfect work - out ahead of @entity85 on sunday			1
@entity2 captain @entity155 issues instructions from his position in front of the back four ' it was good preparation , ' he insisted			1
' a few of the boys like myself having been playing too much football so it was good to get a few minutes			0
' it 's another win which keeps the momentum going			1
there 's another big game on sunday which we are all looking forward to			1
' if we 'd got an earlier goal , it would have been a bit more comfortable but at least we got one			1
' we could have been ahead earlier			0
we 'd a few chances in the first half – i 'd a few myself			0
' i 'm going to blame the goalie for the one i missed and not myself			0
in fairness , he pulled off a few good saves although it was frustrating we never got the goal before we did			1
but the win keeps us going for the weekend			0
' both teams obviously had one eye on the games that really matter at the weekend			0
you could see that with the changes that were made			0
' both managers wanted to keep everyone 's legs fresh			1
both nations have got two big games coming up			0
' @entity97 attempted to temper the expectation that sunday 's game will be a total formality			1
' we 're not going in there thinking we 're going to run them into the ground , ' he insisted			0
' we just want to put on a performance that the gaffer sets us out to do and if we do that hopefully we can get the win			0
' goal difference does n't matter against them but it will matter in terms of confidence			2
we 've got a massive game against @entity214 in the summer so if we can get a win and a few goals it will be happy days			0

@entity0 headed home against @entity14 in the 85th minute
@entity0 's goal proved to the be the winner as @entity2 prevailed 1 - 0
