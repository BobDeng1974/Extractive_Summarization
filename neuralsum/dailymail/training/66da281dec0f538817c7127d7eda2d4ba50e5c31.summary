but while working up a sweat and drinking dubious looking green juices may help you tone up and shed the flab , there is little that can be done about smaller - than - desired or sagging breasts			1
now a new bikini has been launched that promises to boost a lacklustre bust line by an incredible two cup sizes			1
after : the @entity21 bust - boosting bikini ( top , £ 26 , bottoms , £ 12 ) uses clever gel and foam padding combined with under wiring to achieve a boost of two cup sizes before : most normal bikinis offer no boost to cleavage and minimal support			1
here the difference made by the @entity34 ( pictured above ) is obvious the @entity1 brand @entity36 ’s new two piece , sold by @entity38 , doubles the previous cup enhancement that could be gained from a bikini , and all without having to go under the knife			1
the bikini top uses gels and foams to increase the look of the breasts by two cup sizes and gives them a one cup lift effect			1
the range sold out in under two hours when it was trialled last year as more and more women are looking for alternatives to expensive and painful surgery that still delivers results			1
with a host of celebrities such as @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 having gone under the knife , having a fuller bust line is a popular look			0
@entity58 underwent a £ 4,000 operation to take her from an a-cup ( left ) to a c - cup , as she said having a small bust made her feel un-womanly @entity59 has been open about her breast enhancement and is often pictured displaying the results of her surgery , prompting women to want to emulate her bigger cleavage this boosting range is available in three versions , @entity73 , @entity21 and @entity74 , depending on the level of cup size increase you are after and costs from £ 8 - £ 26			1
- the first swimsuit appeared in 1830 , and covered a woman from ankle to wrist			0
- by the 1930 ’s , necklines plunged at the back , sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away			0
swimsuits started hugging the body and used materials such as lastex and nylon			0
- the bikini as we know it first appeared on the beaches of @entity96 in 1947 , however the garment dates back to @entity97 when it was worn by women for athletic purposes in @entity100			2
- it was made popular in the 20th century by pin - up girls such as @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
- in 1962 , @entity108 girl @entity107 emerged from the sea wearing a white bikini in dr. no. this has been declared the top bikini moment in film history , and firmly put the bikini on the map			2
- @entity117 first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962			2
- by the 2000 ’s , bikinis became a multi-million pound business annually			0
and unlike some ‘ enhancing ’ underwear ( think granny - like beige control pants ) the bikinis come in fun , fashionable fabrics and designs to keep you looking fashionable on the sands			0
the green bikini top , £ 26 , has a polka dot design with gathered sides and a self tie halter neck and is underwired for additional support			1

‘ with over 20 pieces in the range , there ’s enough to last women more than a two week holiday in the sun , meaning they can feel confident and happy to bare their beach bods the entire break			2
