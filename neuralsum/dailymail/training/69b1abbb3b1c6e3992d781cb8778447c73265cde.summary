@entity0 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity3 by @entity0 as a former @entity6 captain and big @entity6 fan there is nothing i would love more than to see @entity11 ’s team reach a quarter - final showdown with @entity13 hosts @entity14			1
what a tantalising prospect , facing @entity14 on their own turf , in the spiritual home of the beautiful game , in a last - eight match that could feasibly happen on july 4 in @entity21			1
but if i was a betting man i would not risk money on @entity6 getting out of @entity23 , let alone making it within sight of the semi-finals			1
samba showdown : @entity6 could face @entity14 in the @entity13 quarter - finals ... should they get through their group @entity31 : @entity32 @entity33 : @entity34 @entity35 : @entity36 do n't blame it on @entity38 ! @entity0 is not sure @entity6 will progress because they will be physically wrecked i ’m not damning their chances completely			1
but let ’s have a bit of realism and accept that there are three teams in the section who have a shot at progressing , and three into two does n’t go			2
i expect @entity33 to win the group			1
they have vast experience in their ranks			2
they ’ve got players who have won a @entity13 , with @entity57 , @entity34 and @entity58 among them			1
they ’ve got big - stage temperament and high - class individuals , from @entity34 to @entity61			1
they ’re well organised , always , and @entity6 could definitely have had an easier start than a rumble in the jungle in @entity66 with the @entity33			1
a point at least from the opening game is a minimum requirement for @entity6 , in my view , or an early exit will beckon			1
and a point is no gim me			2
so @entity6 will almost certainly need to get the better of @entity31			1
that can happen , of course it can			0
it would n’t surprise me if both sides find the net in that second group game , especially if @entity6 have had a positive start			1
but is it feasible @entity6 could get beaten by one or both of @entity33 and @entity31 ? absolutely			1
challenge : @entity84 is still finding his fitness after three warm up games , including against @entity87 @entity33 : with players like @entity34 ( @entity89 ) and @entity90 ( c ) @entity33 will be favourites to win the group double whammy ! @entity6 could also get beaten by @entity31 , especially if @entity94 is in form i hope that does not happen but there are gruelling fixtures ahead , mentally and physically , and we can be our own worst enemy as a country in terms of how we prepare for these tournaments			1
the @entity105 is brilliant ; excitement every week , fantastically popular			1
but it lets us down as a national team because there is no winter break			0
we turn up for @entity111 already disadvantaged because so many players are injured , bandaged up , drained			2
and that ’s before a ball is kicked			0
i ’m talking now as somebody who has seen this and lived it			0
we all play with knocks at times			0
we all play fatigued on occasions			0
it ’s part and parcel of our profession			0
but from inside experience of having been an @entity6 player at two @entity111 , in 2002 and 2006 , playing five matches at each , we were ending the group stages physically knackered , gone — before the knockout stage even started			1
burn out : @entity6 players such as @entity132 often arrive at tournaments exhausted from a gruelling @entity105 season walking wounded : @entity135 faces a fitness race after picking up an injury against @entity138 fitness is a huge factor in performance and undervalued far too often			1
heavy legs and weary bodies are a real issue when the turnover of games is so quick			0
no doubt some people will say , hang on , what about all the foreign players who play in the @entity105 and manage to shine ? yes , some do			1
@entity151 famously went back and forward to @entity152 and did the business			0
@entity154 , to name one @entity156 example , plays a heap of games for club and country			0
but exceptional people being capable of exceptional feats does not get away from the fact that , as a group , @entity6 ’s players have a uniquely long , hard , unbroken domestic season			1
in the same boat : @entity168 's @entity154 ( @entity169 ) will also have experienced a tough season for club and country rested : @entity172 ( @entity169 ) and @entity174 's @entity173 have the advantage of a winter break @entity173 have fewer games because the @entity178 is only 18 teams , and they have a winter break			2
@entity180 and @entity33 : lower tempo leagues , and winter breaks			1
@entity172 ? winter break and arguably less intensity than @entity6 , where the pace and grinding physical demands do stack up			2
this is not an excuse			0
but , as someone who knows , i ’m telling you that it is one contributory factor and , at elite level , margins matter			0
we ’re going out there with @entity197 before we get started			0
on a more upbeat note , the youth and vibrancy of @entity11 ’s squad excite me			2
i was a kid myself , age 19 , when @entity204 took me to the @entity205 , even though i did n’t play			0
give youth a chance : @entity0 ( c ) travelled to the @entity205 under @entity204 but did n't play young gun : @entity135 @entity209 foot : @entity211 saints alive : @entity213 you get that call and your dreams are made — an opportunity to go to an event most people will never experience			2
there ’s a buzz around the country , the flags come out , expectations build and you realise the size of what is expected			0
and if you ’ve got the right mentality you thrive on that , desperate to deliver for everyone back home			0
i know the lads in @entity38 will be full of nervous anticipation and high hopes			0
if @entity6 are to deliver , though , the tournament has to start well , and that , for me , will entail stopping @entity34 ’s magic			1
how ? i recall one @entity238 game against @entity239 for @entity240 at @entity241 in early 2010 when sir @entity242 put @entity243 on @entity34			2
he man - marked him out of the game			2
@entity34 would typically make up to 90 of his incisive passes per match			2
that night he was limited to 32			0
we joked later that @entity250 did such a superb job that when @entity34 woke up the next morning , @entity243 - sung was at the foot of his bed ! @entity255 job : @entity34 ran rings around @entity6 at @entity257 , including a cheeky penalty @entity61 is also a huge talent but @entity34 is consistently brilliant and if @entity6 stop him — unlike at @entity257 , when he cut us to pieces from start to finish — then that ’s a start			1
in my ideal xi ( see panel ) , i ’d hand @entity268 that task			0
getting something from @entity33 could be the platform to progress , perhaps a second - round match against @entity273 or the @entity274			1
then maybe that quarter - final			2
that for me would be a dream scenario			0
he ’s had the courage to select a raw , young squad			0
now i hope he gives them a chance to play — and takes off the shackles			0
@entity283 favours the brave .			0

@entity0 would like to see @entity6 face @entity14 at the @entity13
former @entity6 captain is *unsure* @entity6 will get out of @entity23
@entity11 's players will have to get past @entity33 , @entity31 and @entity35
@entity0 blames a gruelling @entity105 season without breaks as the reason for @entity6 's woes at major tournaments
@entity0 has *earmarked* @entity33 's @entity34 as @entity6 's biggest threat
