by @entity0 it 's the nation 's favorite burger chain , more secret than in - @entity3 and with only 11 restaurants outside of @entity5 , even rarer			1
founded in @entity7 in 1969 , @entity6 was crowned @entity9 's best fast food burger in a recent survey , trumping the hugely popular and fashionable @entity11 , despite having little to none brand recognition			1
indeed , after the publication of the @entity17 findings earlier this month , the @entity14 's website crashed , presumably due to millions of @entity9 trying to discover how they could get their hands on the nation 's best burger			2
number 1 : the @entity6 's @entity22 is the nation 's favorite according to a recent survey published in july the @entity17 survey was notable for the fact that @entity28 came last in addition to the fact that @entity11 did n't take the top spot			1
the comprehensive survey included 65 chains at which 96,208 burgers , chicken sandwiches , subs , sandwiches and burrito 's were eaten			0
the survey posed this simple question , ' on a scale of 1 to 10 , from least delicious to most delicious you â€™ve ever eaten , how would you rate the taste ? ' with the @entity14 's cheesburgers scoring above eight on the scale , @entity5 's best kept fast - food secret suddenly became an obsession for @entity48 everywhere			1
table : the burger survey in its full glory reveals that @entity52 's in last place besting famous chains like @entity55 and @entity56 favorite @entity57 , the habit is known for its signature @entity22 and has only recently expanded into @entity61 and @entity62			0
however , unlike in - @entity11 , who steadfastly refuse to come to the @entity56 , @entity14 is opening a restaurant in @entity65 , just 30 minutes from @entity66			0
its burgers have no gimmick and do not look fancy			0
in fact the @entity22 is a classic patty with ' mayonnaise , pickle , fresh tomato , lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun			0
' @entity78 : the @entity14 began in @entity5 in 1969 , but is now coming to the @entity56 toppings : the burgers come with mushroom toppings and bacon and have been voted the best in the country also on the menu are a fresh grilled albacore tuna sandwich , salads and shakes , sundaes and cones			0
the consumer reports survey found 21 other burgers more palatable than @entity52 's @entity93 the 2014 results show a shift in @entity9 fast - food preference , with diners placing a new importance on quality over convenience compared to the 2011 report			1
' fast - casual dining in places like @entity111 and @entity112 lets the consumer guide the staff to prepare their meal just the way they like it , @entity102 , executive vice president of @entity103 , a food - service research and consulting firm , told the magazine			2
chains like @entity119 and @entity120 , which serve meat produced without antibiotics , also ranked higher on the lists			0
this change in eating habits may be influenced by the millennial generation , the magazine says , who are eating at cheap fast - casual restaurants in order to dine out more often			2
bottom : it may be the world second largest fast - food franchise , but @entity52 's serves up the worst fast - food burgers in the @entity136 according to a new survey			1

the @entity6 and @entity139 triumphed in recent survey to find nation 's favorite fast - food burger
based in @entity5 , the chain has less than 100 restaurants but is opening one in @entity65
