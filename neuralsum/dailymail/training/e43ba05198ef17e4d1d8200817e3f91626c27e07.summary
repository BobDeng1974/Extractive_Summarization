by @entity0 for @entity1 ever ' had to go ' while swimming in the ocean but felt guilty about polluting the water ? well , feel guilty no more - according to the @entity4 peeing in the ocean is not only harmless , it is actually good for marine life			1
in a video , it says the components of urine pose no threat to life in the ocean , and if anything they can be beneficial - but they add peeing in enclosed areas like pools is a big no. we should n't feel guilty about going to the loo in the ocean , say experts from the @entity4			1
with a similar composition to sea water , urine will not dramatically alter it a lot of people will no doubt have encountered the problem of going for a swim in the sea before realising they need to go to the toilet			1
researchers have warned that urinating in swimming pools could lead to health problems			1
scientists found that compounds in urine mixed with chlorine can cause chemicals that have been linked to respiratory effects in swimmers to form			0
they warned swimmers to stop the common practice after analysing samples			0
' if swimmers avoided urinating in pools , then air and water quality would likely improve independent of other changes in water treatment or air circulation , ' the scientists from @entity51 and @entity52 wrote in the journal @entity54			0
but rather than facing the daunting trek back to a bathroom on land , they choose to relieve themselves in the water unbeknown to others			0
the @entity4 says it is ‘ absolutely okay ’ to go in the ocean in a video on @entity63 for the channel reactions			2
the first reason for this is that urine is mostly water , with the average human ’s urine composed of 95 per cent water , while also containing sodium and chloride ions			0
by comparison , sea water is about 96.5 per cent water and also contains sodium and chloride , albeit in a higher concentration			2
both also contain potassium , so all in all urine wo n’t dramatically alter sea water in its vicinity			1
the video explains urea in urine can actually be beneficial as it creates ammonium that feeds ocean plant life , so going to the loo when you 're down at the seaside ( @entity93 beach during the @entity94 2013 shown ) is fine			1
but they add that peeing in enclosed areas like swimming pools is not encouraged another factor at play is urea , which is the main waste product in urine			1
‘ as our bodies break down proteins in food urea is the leftover compound that gets rid of the excess nitrogen in our bodies			0
’ but the amount of urea released , especially in proportion to an entire ocean , is tiny			2
for example , the volume of the @entity112 is 350 quintillion ( 18 zeroes ) litres			0
apparently even if everyone went to the toilet in the ocean , there would still be a miniscule 60 parts per trillion of urea in the water			0
in addition , urea contains a lot of nitrogen , which combines with water to produce ammonium			0
ammonium , in turn , feeds ocean plant life - meaning it is actually beneficial			1
and finally , the video points out that every animal in the ocean also pees in the water ; a whale , for example , can let out 970 litres of urine per day			2
‘ so if they ’re not harming things , you certainly are n’t as well , ’ the video says			0
they add , however : ‘ do n’t pee in protected areas like reefs or smaller bodies of water , especially swimming pools			1

according to a video created by the @entity4 , we should not feel guilty about going to the loo in the ocean
the small amount of waste we deposit has ' no effect on the water '
with a similar composition to sea water , urine will not dramatically alter it
urea in urine can be *helpful* - it creates ammonium that feeds ocean plant life
but peeing in enclosed areas such swimming pools is ' not to be encouraged '
