by @entity0 a rogue nation could use climate change as an excuse to carry out potentially disastrous experiments with geoengineering , experts warn			1
a country threatened by rising sea levels or even a wealthy individual could use their resources to tamper with the atmosphere in a bid to cool the planet , with uncertain consequences			2
the nightmare possibility , which could set off a disastrous chain reaction in the @entity18 's climate systems , is one possible ' @entity19 ' considered in a report on global risks by the @entity22			1
an aircraft leaving a vapour trail : a new report warns that a rogue nation or individual could use climate change as an excuse to unilaterally send planes into the stratosphere to release dust to block light from the @entity34 ' the global climate could , in effect , be hijacked by a rogue country or even a wealthy individual , with unpredictable costs to agriculture , infrastructure and global stability , ' the report warns			1
scientists worried about climate change are exploring ways in which they could artificial manipulate the @entity18 's climate in an attempt to mitigate some of its worst effects			1
many different processes have been mooted for such geoengineering , but the most common suggestion is for ' solar radiation management ' in which particles of sulphur could be injected into the stratosphere to block solar energy			2
in the past , volcanic eruptions have achieved the same effect , and scientists have claimed such solar management would take effect quickly and be cheap to implement			0
recent studies have suggested that a small fleet of aircraft could inject a million tons of sulphur compounds into the stratosphere - enough to offset half the global warming recorded to date - for just $ 1 - 2billion a year			0
' in theory , the technology would be tantamount to a planetary thermostat , giving humans direct control over global temperature , ' said the @entity22 report			1
' the direct impact of dimming the sun would be felt within weeks to months			0
' but the potential side effects of such large - scale interference with our planet 's climate systems are unknown - and could be disastrous			1
' the problem is that incoming solar radiation drives the entire climate system , so reducing sunlight would fundamentally alter the way energy and water moves around the planet , ' the report said			2
' almost any change in weather and climate patterns is likely to create winners and losers , but determining causation and quantifying impacts on any given region or country would be a massive challenge			2
' melting : these images from @entity101 show reveal the full extent of @entity104 ice shrinkage , showing a new record low compared to the average minimum extent over the past 30 years ( in yellow ) the warning came in a special section of the @entity22 's @entity111 report published on tuesday which focuses on ' @entity113 ' - emerging concerns of possible future importance and with unknown consequences			1
in collaboration with the respected scientific journal nature , the report 's writers present five possible high risk scenarios which could sneak up on an unsuspecting world with little warning			1
in addition to the threat posed by rogue geoengineers , other @entity113 identified in the report include : last month a scientist claimed that not only could we use geoengineering to refreeze the @entity104 , but that ' any significant nation ' could find the resources to carry out the operation			2
the possibility that a nation or individual could unilaterally tamper with the globe 's climate may seem like the plot of a @entity140 spy thriller but , as the @entity22 report notes , it has already happened			1
in july last year , @entity143 businessman @entity142 attempted to capture carbon from the air by dumping 100 tons of iron sulphate into the @entity147 to spawn an artificial plankton bloom			0
he succeeded in producing a bloom as large as 10,000 sq / km which he hoped would absorb carbon dioxide from the air then sink to the sea bed , allowing him to cash in on lucrative carbon credits			0
however , his actions may have been in violation of two international agreements			0
lab tests have shown that such plankton blooms can pump out neurotoxins , disrupt food chains and alter ecosystems in unexpected ways			0
worse still , they can even expedite ocean acidification , which would actually accelerate global warming			0
@entity168 , professor of applied physics at @entity170 , is lead author on papers published in @entity172 and @entity173 which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice			2
' the really hard questions here are n’t mostly technical			0
they ’re questions about what kind of planet we want and who we are , ' he told @entity184 newspaper @entity183			0
professor @entity168 used climate models to suggest that injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity18 , engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the @entity104			1
his paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea - ice around the @entity197 back to pre-industrial era levels			0
' decisions involving ( solar radiation management ) do not need to be reduced to a single " global thermostat " , ' the paper says			0
his second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified @entity206 jets , costing somewhere in the region of $ 8billion a year			0
however , while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the @entity18 's atmosphere , he does n't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest			1
open - air and large - scale geoengineering of the kind professor @entity168 has suggested has been ruled out by the @entity218			2
such drastic geoengineering could have disastrous unintended effects but could be a viable response to a ' climate emergency ' such as the sudden collapse of ice sheets or a killing drought , professor @entity168 suggested .			1

warning comes from @entity22 's @entity111 report
such geoengineering could have *terrifying* unintended consequences
the risk that climate change could *trigger* a *runaway* chain reaction that would make the @entity18 *inhospitable* to life ;
@entity239 *dilemmas* related to the emergence of *cognitive* *enhancing* drugs and *devices* that could make some people *artficially* *smarter* ;
medical advances that could lead to a future *society* *burdened* by a ' mass of *arthritic* , *demented* and , above all , *expensive* , *elderly* ' ;
the discovery of alien life and the huge implications that could have on our *societies* .
