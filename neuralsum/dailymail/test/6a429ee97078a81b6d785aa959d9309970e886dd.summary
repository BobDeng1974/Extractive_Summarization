a cafe owner has laid down a challenge to diners with a gut - busting morning meal that contains a whopping 4,000 calories			1
@entity5 , 27 , is offering his version the @entity7 , which is stuffed with the equivalent of almost 100 teaspoons of sugar , at his @entity11 cafe in @entity13 's @entity12			1
the breakfast includes two types of cereal served in half an @entity17 , with brownies , marshmallows and mini eggs , topped off with three different types of flavoured milk			1
the @entity7 breakfast is available at @entity24 in @entity13 's @entity12 up for the challenge : customer @entity26 attemps the 4,000 - calorie meal which has 388g of sugar the meal is so sweet it contains the equivalent of 388g of sugar or 97 teaspoons			1
for Â£ 7 , customers looking to get their day off to a jittery start will be treated to a 291g milk chocolate @entity17 , with one half used as a bowl , served on a bed of baked and caramelised white chocolate to support the structure			1
two cereals of choice are added together with a @entity41 , a handful of @entity43 , home - made chocolate brownie and a @entity47 chocolate bar			0
marshmallows and @entity49 's are thrown into the mix , before the whole dish is generously drizzled in homemade @entity52 - an @entity54 take on condensed milk - and salted caramel sauce			2
he starts off in high spirits , pouring the first of the three milks into his chocolate ' bowl ' mr @entity26 takes on the @entity7 ( left ) but barely gets through before he regrets his decision ( right ) finally , customers are treated to three milks of choice which can be taken from a range including black squid ink milk , chocolate , strawberry , vanilla and good old semi-skimmed			0
mr @entity5 , whose cafe specialises in world cereals , milkshakes and cheesecake , says he has carried his fine - dining and knowledge of being a wine sommelier into @entity11			1
he created the @entity80 to celebrate the gluttony of @entity17			2
@entity83 's chocolate egg ( 291g ) : 150g sugar ; 1,400 calories baked caremalised white chocolate : 9g sugar ; 80 calories kosher cereal from @entity90 : 8g sugar ; 150 calories toffee crisp cereal : 7.2g sugar ; 150g calories home - made brownie : 7g sugar ; 410 calories @entity41 : 26.5g sugar ; 177 calories @entity43 : 20.5g sugar ; 148 calories @entity47 : 16.7g sugar ; 171 calories @entity106 ; 315 calories salted caramel sauce 10g sugar ; 300 calories @entity110 : 30g sugar ; 300 calories marshmallows : 40g sugar ; 75 calories m&ms : 13g sugar ; 140 calories total : 3,816 calories			1
average man needs 2,500 calories per day			0
' it 's all in the spirit of @entity17 , ' he said			2
' @entity17 is less about what is used to mean , and now on @entity125 people try and go through as many chocolate eggs as they can , so this is another challenge for them			2
' no one has managed to finish it yet but we 'll be running it until the end of the @entity133 to see if anyone can			0
' he said the initial idea for the @entity7 came to him after seeing soup served inside giant bread bowls in @entity139 and he wanted to transfer the concept to the cereal market			0
' i want to push it further and come up with wacky concoctions and push the limits of cereal and milk and what you can do with it , ' he said			0
although his cafe may stake a claim to creating @entity154 's most tooth - rotting dish , mr @entity5 is keen to point out some of the shop 's biggest sellers are muesli , @entity158 and protein granolas used as an after - gym snack			1
sweet - toothed customer @entity26 bravely attempted the challenge , opting for @entity163 and a kosher cereal from @entity90 as his two choices			0
he said : ' i absolutely love chocolate , so this seemed like it would be a doddle at first			0
' after tucking straight into the @entity41 , the @entity47 and the brownie , i realised even that was more chocolate than anybody needs to eat in one sitting			0
' the cereal was delicious , but like the @entity17 bowl once the milk was poured , i started to crumble			2
' ten minutes , an aching belly and fuzzy teeth later , i called it a day with just the bowl to spare			0
my nine - year - old self would have been disappointed , but he did n't have to pay to go to the dentist ! ' the @entity7 is made of half a @entity83 's chocolate egg ; baked caremelised white chocolate ; kosher cereal from @entity90 ; toffee crisp cereal ; home - made brownie ; @entity41 ; @entity43 ; @entity189 ; salted caramel sauce ; three milks ; marshmallows and @entity49 's @entity5 starts the assembly process for his sugar - laden @entity7 breakfast			1
