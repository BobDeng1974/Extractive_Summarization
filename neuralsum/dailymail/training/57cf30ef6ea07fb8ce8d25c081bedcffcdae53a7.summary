booted : @entity1 doctoral student @entity0 was unceremoniously kicked out of her school and stripped of her visa behind @entity1 's infamous ban on @entity6 students studying at the university is a 31 - year - old doctoral student from outside @entity9 whose experience sparked the entire controversy			1
@entity0 was a second year phd student whose research on fuel cells concerned university officials enough to drop her from the university late last year along with their sponsorship of her visa while she was visiting her home country			1
while @entity0 languished in @entity6 with little explanation and no one willing to help her , @entity1 rewrote its policies concerning @entity6 students			1
officials said the change was made to better conform to a 2012 federal law that makes @entity6 citizens who are seeking degrees to prepare them for work in their country 's energy sector ineligible for visas			1
' i was very shocked and heartbroken , ' @entity0 told @entity31 in a phone interview from @entity6			1
before this year 's chain of events , @entity0 was a student in the highly regarded university 's @entity34			2
she was in her second year of study into fuel cells used to produce clean energy when she unceremoniously got the boot			1
' they were all aware of my research , ' she says of her administrators and colleagues			0
' the university was aware what my phd thesis was about			0
' nonetheless , she says she could find no one to vouch for her as she attempted to return to the country			0
so , hoping to convince the university in person , she flew to @entity52			0
on january 14 , @entity31 reports , @entity0 was stopped at a @entity52 airport , cuffed and held overnight before being shipped back to @entity6			2
later in january , she would petition @entity1 to reconsider			2
instead , the school hardened its policies regarding @entity6 students			2
upon trying to return to the @entity58 following a trip home to @entity6 , officials saw that @entity0 's research at the university 's @entity34 involved energy production			1
the school feared ran counter to a 2012 federal law barring @entity6 nationals in pursuit of degrees that could train them to work in their country 's energy sector from getting visas on february 6 , the school officially banned @entity6 from studying many hard science fields , some of which were n't even specified by the 2012 federal law			1
at the time , the school claimed the policy change stemmed from ' an inquiry from a student			0
' an outcry soon ensued from within @entity1 and without as critics called foul on what they claimed were draconian new policies			2
then , on february 18 , the school turned heel , deciding to reverse its decision to ban @entity6 nationals from admission to certain graduate programs after consulting further with the @entity89 and private attorneys			1
' we have always believed that excluding students from admission conflicts with our institutional values and principles			0
it is now clear , after further consultation and deliberation , that we can adopt a less restrictive policy , ' said @entity100 , vice chancellor for research and engagement			0
the university said it will develop individualized study plans based on a student 's projected coursework to meet the requirements of federal sanctions law			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , remains in limbo in @entity6			1
however , @entity1 chancellor @entity110 said in a statement to @entity31 on tuesday : ' the student did not do anything wrong , and we regret that she endured a difficult and trying period at the airport			0
' we are exploring how we might help her continue her education , and if we can identify an alternative line of study that fulfills the requirements of federal law			0

@entity0 is a 31 - year - old @entity6 national whose doctoral research on fuel cells got her booted from @entity1
@entity0 was banned from returning to the @entity58 early this year after @entity1 dropped its sponsorship of her visa while she was visiting home
after dropping her , @entity1 rewrote its policies to *protect* the school from a 2012 law banning @entity6 from training for *careers* in @entity6 's energy sector
the school has since turned heel on its policy , but @entity0 remains stuck in @entity6
