on call : riot police were called to the reception of the couple 's gypsy wedding after a fight broke out between guest and gatecrashers ( stock image ) reception : gatecrashers caused a fight after turning up at the couple 's reception at the @entity21 in @entity22 in @entity84 ' it was a really pleasant wedding to organise because the bride was so relaxed			1
' @entity88 weddings are known for being extravagant and this was no different			0

lavish : @entity2 and @entity3 were married in a typically @entity5 style wedding at @entity106 in @entity107 ' i know one of the gatecrashers was cut on their head and there was smashed glass and blood outside			1
