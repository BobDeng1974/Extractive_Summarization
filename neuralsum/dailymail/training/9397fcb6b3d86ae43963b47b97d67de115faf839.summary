man of the match @entity0 hailed one of the ' greatest moments ' in his fledgling @entity4 career after helping his side snatch a 2 - 1 comeback victory over 10 - man @entity7 with a late winner at @entity10			1
@entity7 's five - game and 15 - minute wait for a goal ended when @entity13 opened the scoring following a spell of dominance from the hosts as he collected @entity19 's cross to slot home from close range			1
tempers flared for the second time in little over five minutes after the hour mark and @entity24 was shown a straight red card by referee @entity26 after a tussle with @entity28 in which the @entity29 international raised his hand to his opponent 's face			2
@entity0 , on as a substitute , scored the winner before diving in front of the travelling @entity4 supporters @entity0 's free - kick deflects off @entity41 's head and past @entity42 into the back of the @entity7 net things started to go downhill for the hosts after that and @entity4 found their equaliser with five minutes left as an unmarked @entity49 fired home @entity28 's corner , before substitute @entity0 's deflected last - gasp free - kick claimed all three points for the away side			1
@entity0 told @entity55 1 : ' without a doubt it was one of the greatest moments for me in a @entity4 shirt in my career so far			2
to be 1 - 0 down in an important game for us , we needed a win and to pull it back there at the end is a moment i wo n't forget			1
' the 21 - year - old striker , who was sent on by @entity70 with just over 30 minutes left , added : ' the manager said there 's plenty of time left , to be getting on the ball , you 'll get some chances so take one and obviously fortunately i was able to do that and it 's all smiles in the dressing room now			1
' @entity0 is chased by his team - mates after scoring the winner in the last moments of the game at @entity10 the travelling @entity4 fans celebrate with the @entity4 players in front of them at @entity10 on sunday as for taking the 89th - minute free - kick , @entity0 said : ' he ( @entity28 ) wanted it and he 'd taken the one before , but i said ' this one can be mine ' and obviously it ended up in the back of the net and it was great - a great result			1
' @entity4 manager @entity70 believes @entity0 has certainly put his name forward to be included in the starting line - up for his side 's next assignment away to @entity98 in the @entity99 on thursday			1
' yes it will be difficult because he score and gave us the victory and he gave a big impact for us			2
he deserves this reality , ' said the @entity4 boss			2
@entity13 put @entity7 1 - 0 in front after 16 minutes ending his side 's goal drought ' we select the team on analysis but since the beginning of the season he is getting better and improving and maybe he deserves to play in the next game , why not ? ' @entity70 was thrilled with his team 's second - half efforts and insisted that his troops were full value for their 2 - 1 victory			1
' the victory , i am happy for the players and the fans today			0
today they were great and with the three points in a difficult stadium it is a good day , ' he added			0
@entity49 levelled matters in the 84th minute against 10 - man @entity7 before @entity0 grabbed the winner late on ' i think we started well			2
if you see the stats we have double chances and more			0
@entity7 only shoot on target a few times but we shoot a lot			0
' we need to be strong because always it is negative on the team but after the game against @entity140 i said we deserve more , our performance did not reflect in the table , but we will practise our philosophy			0
' i do n't see the action			0
maybe now after we analyse maybe			0
in football sometimes this happens throughout the season but i think in the end if we had 11 or 10 we were better than @entity7			0
for us these three points are important .			0

@entity0 's 89th - minute free kick ensured a 2 - 1 victory for @entity4 after the *visitors* were trailing 1 - 0 early in the second - half
