baby boys born in winter are more likely to be left - handed than those born in summer , new research suggests baby boys born in winter are more likely to be left - handed than those born in summer , new research suggests			1
psychologists at the @entity5 studied 13,000 adults and found that overall , 7.5 per cent of women and 8.8 per cent of men were left - handed			1
but they found that among the men , on a monthly average , 8.2 per cent of the left - handers were born during the period february to october			2
yet during november to january , this number rose to 10.5 per cent			0
the researchers said their findings , which were published in the scientific journal @entity16 , backed the theory that left - handedness in men could have a hormonal cause			2
it ’s thought that an embryo ’s exposure to higher levels of the male hormone testosterone in the womb increases their chances of being left - handed			1
more daylight may increase testosterone levels , and as baby boys born in the winter are in the embryonic stage during the spring and summer , they may be exposed to more testosterone			1
lead author of the study , @entity36 , said : ‘ presumably , the relative darkness during the period november to january is not directly connected to this birth seasonality of handedness			0
‘ we assume that the relative brightness during the period may to july , half a year before , is its distal cause			0
’ the effect is explained for men , but not women , because male brains are exposed to substantially higher testosterone levels than female brains during prenatal development			2
the @entity49 , named after the neurologists who devised the theory , suggests that testosterone delays the maturation of the left brain hemisphere during embryonic development			0
psychologists at the @entity5 said their findings backed the theory that left - handedness in men could have a hormonal cause			1
more daylight may increase testosterone levels , and as baby boys born in the winter are in the embryonic stage during the spring and summer , they may be exposed to more testosterone the left brain hemisphere is dominant among right - handers , while the right brain hemisphere is dominant among left - handers			1
in - womb levels of testosterone are higher in the male foetus , because of its own testosterone secretion , than in the female foetus			0
however , the testosterone level of the mother and external factors may also affect levels of the hormone in the womb			0
specifically , more daylight may increase testosterone levels , making a seasonality effect plausible .			0

psychologists at the @entity5 found baby boys born in the period october to february were more likely to be left - handed
backed the theory left - handedness could have a hormonal cause
an embryo *'s* exposure to higher levels of the male hormone testosterone in womb increases chances of being left - handed
more daylight during summer *pregnancies* could boost testosterone levels in baby boys born in winter months
