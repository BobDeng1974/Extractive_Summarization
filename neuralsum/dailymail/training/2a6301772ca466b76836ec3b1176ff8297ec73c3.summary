@entity2 , 53 , took the money from dr @entity11 during a refurbishment planned especially for his daughter 's @entity14 wedding			1
but the builder flooded the doctor ’s @entity18 home , botching a bathroom plumbing job while guests were staying in neighbouring rooms a judge at @entity24 ordered ex-bankrupt @entity2 to carry out 300 hours ’ unpaid work after admitting eight unfair trading offences			1
dr @entity27 , 67 , said outside court : ' he got away lightly			1
' @entity2 , 53 , was a friend trusted by dr @entity27 after building his home and doing work at his @entity32 surgery to his satisfaction			1
he was asked to build an extension , refurbish a bathroom and other works by mid-april last year , in time for dr @entity27 ’s daughter ’s wedding			1
he charged tens of thousands of pounds , plus vat , for the home improvements			2
he took a 50 per cent deposit of £ 23,570 for materials , assuring the family his high quotes were for a ' high specification job '			1
after starting work a week late , he little improvement was made and the increasingly desperate @entity48 struggled to contact him			2
when they found him , he promised : ' without doubt , doctor , i will complete the job by april 15 , 2012			0
' he took another £ 13,748 , which he claimed was needed to get the job moving again			2
but two days earlier , unknown to the @entity48 , his company had been dissolved			0
dr @entity27 had to pay £ 1,600 to repair damage caused by @entity2 , including the major water leak			1
he had to use industrial dehumidifiers in the home for three months			0
his son also had to pay more than £ 5,000 to a builders ’ merchant for materials which @entity2 did n’t deliver			1
when challenged , @entity2 could n’t explain where the family ’s money had gone			1
he downed tools in june last year , leaving barely any work done and having failed to pay a electrician , tiler , painter and decorator			2
prosecutor @entity74 said : ' the work undertaken was really worthless			2
' in short , the family had paid £ 37,318 for labour and materials for little if any value at all			1
' shoddy : work done by @entity2 around pipework in the @entity27 's home unfinished : @entity2 did not complete the work in one of the @entity27 's showers sloppy : @entity2 took £ 37,318 from dr @entity27 for the work , which included this effort on the flooring a surveyor said the work , if done properly , was worth just £ 8,000 , but the family would have to spend that sum just to put right what had gone wrong			1
@entity94 , defending , said the married dad had a good work record for more than 30 years , but was in a desperate situation at the time through ' the most dire ' financial and personal circumstances			2
he said @entity2 showed fremorse and deep regret , now lived with his daughter but was still in the same line of work and would like to repay the money			1
the judge , recorder @entity105 , told @entity2 : ' one can only imagine the stress and inconvenience that you were causing to dr @entity27 and his family in the run - up to what should have been an enjoyable event , namely a family wedding			1
' you ’ve cost them £ 38,000 or more in payments to you			0
that , i have no doubt , was swallowed up in your business			0
mess : the cowboy builder left holes in the wall and bits of tile scattered all over the floor @entity126 : most of the work , including this plumbing behind the bathroom , was left unfinished ' i accept that this was n’t from the outset deliberate behaviour on your part			0
you were seeking to keep a business afloat			0
he said @entity2 had built up a ' creditable business ' before it was hit by the economic crash and he was made bankrupt			2
the judge said he ' richly deserved ' a prison sentence , but suspended the six - month term for two years for his family ’s sake and in the hope of compensation for the @entity48 under the @entity146			0
after sentencing , dr @entity27 said : ' it ’s been disheartening to go through anything like this with an ex-friend , an old friend			1
' i had no choice but to go through this process			0
he did n’t give me any choice because of his arrogance			0
it ’s been very , very stressful			0
' his son , 32 - year - old accountant @entity157 , said : ' he gets that sentence , it ’s not right			0
i do n’t think it ’s fair			0
we never wanted it to come to this			0
' my dad gave him plenty of opportunities to finish the job			0
it was like talking to a brick wall			0
