@entity2 migrants should be banned from claiming benefits until they have paid taxes for at least six months , @entity0 has said in a toughening of @entity7 policy on immigration			1
the deputy prime minister also suggests in - work benefits like tax credits should only be available to people working full - time on the minimum wage			1
it marks an escalation in the political arms race to get tough on immigration marked by the rise of @entity19 , and comes ahead of @entity21 's long - awaited speech on how he wants to cap the total number of people who can come to @entity25 from @entity2			2
@entity37 has made clear that mr @entity21 wants to be able to tackle the numbers of people who can move from other @entity33 countries , as well as limiting access to the welfare state			2
but mr @entity0 warned the @entity43 were in danger of making ' irresponsible declarations ' on @entity2 in a bid to quell unrest at the rise of @entity19			0
instead the @entity7 leader insisted the @entity25 could find allies in @entity2 to support efforts to tackle so - called ' benefits tourism ' without challenging the key principle of free movement which is regarded as non-negotiable by countries including @entity55			1
mr @entity0 suggested that migrants could be prevented from claiming the new universal credit until they have ' worked and contributed ' to the system			1
under the @entity7 plan , they would have had to work in the @entity25 for six months before being able to claim the new @entity60 and then claims would stop after six months			1
he also proposed restricting access to in - work benefits like tax credits , suggesting that migrants could be required to work the equivalent of full - time hours on the minimum wage in order to qualify			1
this would mean earnings would have to be £ 227 - a - week , instead of the current £ 153			0
mr @entity0 warned the prime minister 's speech could put the @entity25 economy at risk if he proposes measures which would jeopardise the country 's @entity33 membership in an effort to win back supporters from @entity81 's @entity19			1
mr @entity0 set out details of his plans to curb access to benefits ahead of talks with @entity55 vice chancellor @entity86 in @entity27 latest figures show that almost 65,000 people from the @entity33 were claiming jobseekers allowance in february this year @entity43 a limit on the number of @entity33 migrants who can come to @entity25 @entity33 migrants banned from claiming universal credit , which replaces the main out - of - work benefits and tax credits @entity7 no benefits through @entity60 until claimants have worked for six months , and claims then limited to six months restricting access to in - work benefits like tax credits to those migrants who work the equivalent of full - time hours on the minimum wage paying child benefit at the rate of home countries , so a @entity110 worker would get £ 18 not £ 80 - a - month for a family back home			1
wants to stop exporting child benefit altogether labour increasing the time @entity33 jobseekers must wait before claiming out - of - work benefits from three months to two years			1
changing rules on in - work benefits to stop employers using tax credits to top up low wages for temporary workers ending the ' absurdity ' of child benefit and child tax credits being paid to workers in the @entity25 for children living elsewhere in the @entity33 writing in the @entity127 , mr @entity0 said mr @entity81 wanted to ' pull up the drawbridge ' and acknowledged it was a ' message that has played well ' in the by - elections in @entity131 and @entity132 and @entity133			1
but he said : ' the bigger danger now is that a rattled conservative party resorts to equally irresponsible declarations , in a bid to calm their own ranks			0
' @entity21 will soon give his much built - up immigration speech			0
if the prime minister asserts that a @entity143 government will introduce caps or overall quotas on the number of @entity33 migrants coming here , we will find ourselves in the worst of all worlds			1
' @entity19 will say it is not enough			0
@entity2 will say it is not possible			0
once again the @entity25 people will be plunged into a cycle of wild overpromising and inevitable disappointment , their scepticism confirmed			2
and the risks to the openness of the @entity25 economy will be considerable			2
' mr @entity0 said it would be possible to work with allies in @entity2 to secure reform within the existing freedom of movement rules			0
the deputy prime minister , who was expected to discuss the issue @entity55 vice-chancellor @entity86 during a visit to @entity27 , said : ' i have already proposed that we work with other states to stop @entity33 migrants from claiming child benefit for children who are not living here			1
' as a first step , we should pay the same rate as the country in which those children reside			0
in the @entity25 it is about £ 80 a month , whereas in @entity110 it is less than half that			2
and there are other proposals we must now explore			0
' as we streamline our welfare system by combining a range of benefits in a single @entity60 , we should make sure that only migrants who have worked and contributed can receive the support			2
' new jobseekers should not be eligible			0
applying the same principle - that support should be reserved for migrants who are paying something into the pot - we should look at increasing the earnings threshold for in - work benefits such as tax credits			1
@entity33 migrants could , for example , be required to work the equivalent of full - time hours on the minimum wage in order to qualify			1
' he said @entity55 was pursuing five year re-entry bans for migrants involved in identity or benefit fraud , suggesting that ' we must see if we can strengthen our laws as well '			2
crucially , he said these measures could be pursued ' without tearing up the freedom to move across @entity2 or threatening to pull out of the @entity33 '			0
' the choice is clear , ' he said			0
' we can feed people ever more irresponsible claims about immigration , raising hopes only to dash them in the end			0
or - far better - we can reform the rules to address people 's legitimate concerns , while safeguarding our open economy too			0
' @entity221 , @entity223 's shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ' you ca n't trust a word the @entity7 say			0
if @entity0 were really serious he would support @entity223 's plan to make fairness and contribution central to @entity25 's welfare system			0
' @entity223 would stop child benefit being sent abroad , restrict out of work benefits for @entity33 migrants for two years , and ensure that there are fair rules in place for in - work benefits for those coming from outside the @entity25			1

deputy pm becomes latest party leader to toughen his stance on migrants
@entity245 on claiming universal credit without working for six months first
@entity33 migrants would then only be able to claim for six months
no in - work benefits without working at least full - time on minimum wage
stop paying child benefit to children outside the @entity25 at *higher* rates
