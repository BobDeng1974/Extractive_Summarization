president @entity0 and @entity2 leader @entity1 put on an almost comically awkward show of unity for the cameras today as they made virtually no eye contact and grimaced as the other spoke following a bilateral meeting at the @entity10			1
@entity0 tilted his chair away from the @entity2 president who fidgeted with his fingers and tapped his feet			2
@entity1 slumped down in his seat , leaned heavily on the arm rests and stared into the distance at the scenic backdrop of @entity19			0
the usually effusive @entity0 , who is never short of hugs for fellow leaders , did not raise a smile , his shoulders hunched and jaw working hard on a piece of gum			0
@entity1 told @entity0 that their positions on @entity41 do not ' coincide ' but they conceded that they have a shared interest in stopping the violence that has ravaged the @entity54 country during a two - year - old civil war			1
@entity0 acknowledged in the bilateral meeting that they have a ' different perspective ' on @entity41 but he said that both leaders wanted to address the fierce fighting and also wanted to secure chemical weapons in the country			1
the words rang out hollowly in the press room as both leaders ' body language appeared to show that little progress had been made on the brutal civil war which has left more than 90,000 @entity41 dead			0
hostile : @entity0 and @entity1 's tensions were palpable despite the relative emptiness of the room direct engagement : the two presidents have a rare moment of eye contact during the meeting at the @entity10 in @entity32 i 'm off ! @entity0 makes a quick getaway while @entity1 puffs his cheeks and holds his ground following the awkward moment in front of the world 's cameras @entity0 mostly stared straight ahead while @entity1 made his remarks , several times closing his eyes or glancing to the side but never looking directly at the president			1
while @entity0 spoke , @entity1 stared into the distance , looked over his shoulder at the scenic view and picked at his fingers			2
the @entity10 leaders ' joint decision to take a more casual approach and ditch the ties at the summit seemed almost comical when faced with the frosty international relations on show			0
at times , they mirrored each other 's hostile body language			0
they rounded their shoulders , steepled their fingers and grimaced			0
ahead of the tense negotiations , it was reported that @entity0 and @entity1 had a stand - off over who would use the gym at the luxury resort - with the @entity36 president emerging victorious , according to @entity113 however the @entity2 leader shrugged off the slight and declared that he would be taking his daily exercise with a macho display of swimming in @entity19			1
cold shoulder : @entity0 and @entity1 failed to cover up the tensions in their political standpoints the @entity36 president said both sides would work to develop talks in @entity124 aimed at ending @entity41 's bloody civil war			1
with steel in his voice , @entity0 added : ' we want to try to resolve the issue through political means if possible			0
' while @entity1 has called for negotiated peace talks , he has not urged @entity41 president @entity43 to leave power , and he remains one of @entity43 's strongest political and military allies			2
good talk ? @entity0 and @entity1 went in for a handshake at the end of the press conference shake on it , buddy : @entity0 and @entity1 grip hands following the tense display in @entity32 global tensions : there appeared to be no love lost between @entity0 and @entity1 today the @entity147 did not expect any breakthrough with @entity1 on @entity41 during the gathering of the @entity10 and the meeting further highlighted the rift between the two countries on how to address the fighting in @entity41			1
@entity0 announced friday that the @entity36 would start sending weaponry , while @entity155 and @entity156 remained concerned that the firepower might end up helping anti-democratic extremists linked to @entity159 and @entity162 's @entity161 militia			2
@entity1 has defended @entity2 's continuing supply of weapons to @entity43 's military			0
@entity0 's discussions with @entity1 capped a busy day that included a preview of future negotiations toward a broad trade deal with the @entity170 and speech in @entity172 where he called peace in @entity32 a ' blueprint ' for those living amid conflict around the world .			1
