the @entity1 experiment by @entity2 how many thousands of books and films are there containing stories about visionaries who set up utopian societies — with untoward consequences ? this book addresses the same subject , but it is not fiction			1
@entity2 tried it for himself , and it drove him mad			1
less than ten years ago , @entity2 was a professional scientist , conducting research into robotics and artificial intelligence			1
but during a holiday to @entity21 in 2005 , he perceived striking parallels between the collapse of the @entity25 empire 1,000 or so years ago and the state of civilisation today			1
could our certainties founder in the way theirs did ? @entity2 returned from his trip to @entity21 with the determination to create a community that could exist without technology and the home comforts we take for granted ( picture posed by models ) as he describes , many societies collapsed in the past ‘ because their energy requirements began to outstrip their energy resources ’			1
but what if a community could rise from the rubble and exist without technology and the home comforts we take for granted ? he returned , determined to create such a community as an experiment , simulating what life after an apocalypse might be like			1
he built it in the @entity55 , mainly from sticks and canvas , and called it @entity1			2
alarmingly , but intriguingly , his book starts with a 3am scream in a psychiatric hospital			2
the scream is n’t his , and it ’s at the end of the experiment , not the beginning , when — for his own safety — he has been detained under the @entity66			2
he recounts how @entity1 tested , and finally broke , his sanity			0
it is a fascinating , troubling and , at times , hilarious tale			0
the inescapable truth is that @entity2 was n’t entirely stable to start with			1
he became a committed ‘ doomer ’ — someone who thinks the @entity73 , if not exactly nigh , is approaching			0
he began to envisage his self - sufficient , post-apocalyptic community , not just as an exercise in social observation , not as @entity78 writ large , but as a kind of dress rehearsal for the real thing			0
inevitably , once news of the project spread , it attracted a motley collection of fellow - utopians : from engaging idealists to raging crackpots , with a few blissed - out hippies in between			0
but he did n’t blunder into the experiment unprepared			0
@entity2 checked out other ‘ eco-villages ’ and ‘ alternative communities ’ , including one near where i live in @entity94			1
indeed , parts of this book reminded me of my own family ’s move to the sticks some years ago			1
like @entity2 , i had a romantic notion of becoming ‘ a horny - handed son of toil ’ , only to be completely at a loss the first time i had to wring an ailing chicken ’s neck			1
for @entity2 , the killing of a pig called @entity109 proved similarly traumatic			1
very quickly , he also found the utopian ideology was about as watertight as one of his leaky yurts , and the egalitarianism lasted about as long as it took for one volunteer to be more forceful than another			0
@entity2 does note , perceptively , that ‘ utopias also attract misfits , whose inability to integrate may not be due to the society they blame , but to their own cantankerous personalities ’			1
@entity125 , given to ululating late at night , was a prime example			0
moreover , the society on which they were all trying not to rely had a nasty habit of encroaching on their commune			0
terrified that one of his volunteers might get hurt , or worse , @entity2 took out third - party liability insurance			1
which , he concedes , ‘ felt like cheating , like i was n’t fully embracing the radical uncertainty of primitive living ’			0
and though they resourcefully made their own toothpaste by mixing baking powder , sea salt and peppermint , they had no idea how to make the baking powder , so bought it from a local supermarket			0
not very hunter - gatherer			0
@entity2 ’ relentless self - questioning about these small , but forgivable , transgressions against the spirit of his own experiment did nothing for his mental health , which further deteriorated as he realised he had invested so much thought and energy into a project that was doomed to failure			2
but this book is much more than an account of a naïve undertaking in the life of a rather strange man			2
for one thing , it radiates an intense intelligence and a candour that is never less than touching and , sometimes , downright heartrending			0
to have written so elegantly and often humorously about his mental health means @entity2 must now , to a great extent , be ‘ better ’			2
but it ’s still an exercise in agonised soul - searching .			0

less than ten years ago , @entity2 was a professional scientist
in 2005 he went on a holiday to @entity21
@entity2 noticed parallels between @entity25 empires and our civilisation today
he became determined to simulate *post-apocolyptic* life
