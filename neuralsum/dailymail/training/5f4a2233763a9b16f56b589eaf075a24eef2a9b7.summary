fifty @entity0 kicked off the ‘ mommy porn ’ phenomenon and is seen as a bit of saucy fun			2
but two evangelical christians are calling on women to mail them their copies of the @entity9 bestseller in exchange for a free guide explaining how readers can achieve ‘ spiritual ’ sexual fulfillment instead , by turning to the @entity14 for guidance			2
dr @entity16 , 45 , from @entity17 , and @entity18 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , are authors of pulling back the shades : erotica , @entity24 and the @entity25 , which is so popular it initially sold out on @entity28			1
authors : @entity30 dr @entity16 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) are calling on women to mail them their @entity33 books in exchange for the free ' spiritual ' @entity14 - based sex guide in less than two weeks , the authors ' team says nearly 350 people have signed up for their ‘ trade your shades ’ promotion that ends on @entity40 - the same day the @entity33 movie hits theaters			1
dr @entity16 and mrs @entity18 say they wrote their book after realizing that members of their own evangelical community were hooked on the @entity33 series			1
mrs @entity18 - a sexuality educator who refuses to read the novels - says she was horrified to learn that ‘ praying grandmas ’ and ‘ pastors ’ wives ’ were reading about bondage and the sexual adventures of the fictitious @entity33 and @entity33			1
‘ the @entity33 phenomenon has done for women what internet porn did for men : fuel its use and normalize it , ’ says dr @entity16			1
‘ it ’s time to add the @entity14 ’s view on sex and intimacy and the spiritual road into meeting a woman ’s deepest human needs and wants			2
’ success : according to the book 's authors , nearly 350 people in less than two weeks have signed up for their ‘ trade your shades ’ promotion that ends on @entity40 dr @entity16 is a psychologist and a married mother - of - three who read the @entity9 novels as research before writing pulling back the @entity80			1
although she was appalled by what she read , she says she was n’t surprised to find she was also aroused			2
‘ i ’m a normal person , ’ she says			0
‘ erotica by definition is designed to arouse			2
‘ so there ’s no reason that i should have a different reaction than everyone else			0
’ but dr @entity16 warns against being sucked into a fantasy world - even if you ’re a married @entity90 who sees it as a bit of harmless fun			1
‘ what it does is it teaches you to respond sexually to someone other than your partner , ’ she says			2
‘ so just like a woman might say it ’s not fair for my husband to compare me to some super airbrushed model he sees in pornographic literature , i would say the same is true when it comes to this sort of erotic fantasy			0
‘ it creates in your mind an appetite for something that ’s not real			0
‘ it makes you less satisfied with the partner that you have and the good things that you have within your relationship			0
’ the other sort of @entity90 : both authors were shocked and concerned by the widespread popularity of @entity9 ' bdsm - based novels ( pictured ) instead dr @entity16 says their book shows the link between the @entity14 and the sexual intimacy she believes that @entity125 intended us to have			1
‘ in our culture we have this @entity130 view of @entity125 and of sexuality , ’ she says			0
' that @entity125 is good and our sexuality is very earthy and base and dirty			0
‘ that ’s not from scripture			0
‘ from the time we were little we ’ve been taught that our sexuality is somehow wrong and so we separate it from a pursuit of holiness			0
’ instead dr @entity16 says married couples can spice up their love lives by exploring new things together , not relying on erotica or porn			1
‘ i think @entity30 should be the most sexually satisfied people in the world , because they understand @entity125 ’s design for it , ’ she says			0
originally published in 2014 , the demand for pulling back the shades is so great it ’s flown off the shelves			1
however , dr @entity16 says some evangelical @entity30 are upset that sex toys , masturbation and oral sex are openly discussed in her book			1
the psychologist and author , who started a ministry called @entity24 , says : ‘ my job is to answer those kinds of questions on a daily basis			0
‘ so if that ’s what women are asking , we want them to feel free to ask and [ get an answer that ] comes from a @entity90 perspective			0
