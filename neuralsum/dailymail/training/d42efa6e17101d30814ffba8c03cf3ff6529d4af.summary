' she told how she was subsequently arrested and said : ' i remember thinking hurry up and ask me questions let me go			0
i knew i had not done anything wrong - i was being kept away from @entity1			1
' why did @entity12 not tell the truth			2

mr @entity93 said : ' for some unknown reason the defendant flew into a rage and carried out the fatal attack			0
he must have spent some minutes inventing a plausible explanation			0
he added : ' this was an assault committed on a child by a man over 6ft and particularly heavy built			0
' he was capable of causing significant damage when striking out in anger			0
the pain and distress would have been immediate and painful			0
' it is impossible to conceive that a two - year - old could have caused such a reaction			1
his intent was an intent just short of that necessary for murder			0
in striking @entity1 he would have instinctively known he would have caused her pain and harm			2
' the injuries would normally be consisting with punching kicking and stamping , throwing against a hard surface			0
the brain injuries were as a result of a violent shake			0
' in mitigation @entity163 said : ' there must have been a build up of tension and pressure at some stage lost control and assaulted @entity1			2

' trusted : miss @entity1 , pictured with @entity12 , left her daughter in her boyfriend 's care when she went to work on 10 april this year			1
@entity12 , right , has never explained the reason behind the ferocious assault sentencing , justice @entity178 told @entity12 : ' you subjected @entity1 to very severe abuse and it implicated her mother who has suffered significantly as a result			1
' she was detained in custody as her daughter was dying and she feels judged every time she goes out			0
the court takes this opportunity to record her dignity - neither she nor anyone else is in anyway to blame			2
' this was an extreme abuse of trust			0
you were in sole trust of @entity1 and this was a violent assault probably in anger during which you must of caused such terrible pain and such terrible fear			2
' no sentence can be long enough			0
i think the fact you lost your temper looking after a child it 's unforgivable			0
