whoever struck the deal to sell @entity2 for £ 50million deserves a knighthood			1
that fee allowed @entity5 to buy @entity6 and @entity7 and improve			1
some of @entity2 ’s sweeping passes were @entity9 - like but when he has a responsibility to defend , he lets his team down			1
look at how he let @entity13 run off him for @entity5 ’s goal			2
@entity2 attempts to hold off @entity7 , one of the two @entity5 stars his £ 50million fee bought in @entity2 has an altercation with @entity6 , the other quality purchase @entity5 brought in after his departure @entity5 defender @entity13 takes advantage @entity2 defensive frailty to score his side 's opener the further @entity5 go in the @entity24 , the more we will see of @entity25			1
he is @entity28 ’s ‘ go to ’ man in the tight games away from home and fits into that system perfectly			2
his presence makes @entity5 even more difficult to break down and allows @entity32 to show a different , dynamic side to his game			1
a word too on @entity32 ’s influence			0
@entity5 have only lost three times this season ; @entity32 – who was excellent here – missed two of those games			0
@entity5 's @entity25 , deployed against @entity42 , is @entity28 ’s ‘ go to ’ man in the tight away games @entity25 allows @entity32 ( centre ) to show a different , dynamic side to his game - he was excellent set pieces could prove to be a big weapon for @entity5 going forward			1
they are such a powerful side , with players such as @entity13 , @entity32 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
they are monsters in the air and could destroy teams who fail to cope with their physicality			0
@entity5 were overloading the area every time they had a wide free - kick or a corner			2
with their big men such as @entity13 , the @entity64 side 's scorer , @entity5 have great weapons at set pieces @entity13 was the man to find the net this time but @entity32 , @entity51 and @entity52 also flood the box @entity42 have a lot of big names but @entity70 put them all in the shade at times			1
the little @entity72 is a wonderful midfielder			0
he takes chances occasionally with how he uses the ball but you can see he is a classy little player and will continue to be an influence in this tie			0
@entity72 @entity70 is a wonderful midfielder and stands out even more than @entity42 's superstars @entity70 attempts to keep close tabs on @entity5 's danger man @entity82 during the 1 - 1 draw @entity5 were knocked out of the @entity24 last season , in part , because @entity82 failed to track back in the semi-final against @entity87			1
the same frailties were exposed here and @entity90 clearly spotted that weakness			0
@entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 all overlapped to great effect and it will have driven @entity28 to distraction			0
@entity52 has been a stalwart and i ’m a fan of his , but @entity100 ’s emergence seems to have rattled him			0
there comes a point in every player ’s career when a young lad emerges to put pressure on you and @entity52 ’s frustrated reaction to the @entity42 equaliser was telling .			2

the £ 50m deal for @entity2 's move from @entity5 to @entity42 allowed the purchase of @entity6 and @entity7 *...* genius
it makes sense that @entity28 calls on *reliable* @entity25 when away
@entity72 @entity70 put @entity42 's bigger name superstars in the shade
@entity82 's *penchant* to not track back remains a frailty for @entity5
@entity42 and @entity5 played a 1 - 1 draw at @entity126 on *tuesday*
