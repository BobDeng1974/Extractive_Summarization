i think we can win this election			0
but clearly , after the general election , you would forge common alliance with parties that you can actually do business with , and the @entity4 must be part of that story			2
' it comes after @entity1 's shadow @entity75 leader @entity74 said in the event of a hung parliament @entity1 ' would speak to any party that has got representation in the @entity75 in order to try to build a majority for a @entity82 that the country desperately needs '			0

' ' there 's only one guaranteed way to stop this – vote @entity93 on may 7			0
' speaking on the @entity105 's today programme this morning , the former foreign secretary @entity103 said the @entity16 needed to ' sound the alarm ' over the threat posed by the @entity4			2
he said : ' we have the danger here that people who want to break up the @entity39 will be running the @entity39 in a few weeks ' time if there is a @entity1 government with a large number of @entity115			2
' and it 's not the conservatives who have talked that up ; it 's the story , whether of opinion polls or of what everybody 's talking about on the ground			0
' he added : ' unless we have a @entity93 majority we will be faced with a @entity1 government in a minority dependent on @entity131 , that they will make impossible demands , they will demand higher taxes , higher welfare spending , weaker defences every single day for five years and that will be disastrous for families across the @entity39 and for the whole future of the @entity39			2
