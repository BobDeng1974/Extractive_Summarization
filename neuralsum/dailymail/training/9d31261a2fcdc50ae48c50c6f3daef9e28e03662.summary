the first sign that @entity1 was losing her vice-like grip on world affairs came shortly before the 1997 general election which ended 18 years of @entity6 rule and brought @entity7 to power			1
as prime minister she had famously survived on four hours sleep a night and the pace had never slowed after her fall from power seven years earlier			1
she was in huge demand on the international lecture circuit , travelling the globe to promote her free - market philosophy			1
then , abruptly , at the end of 1996 , her aides detected an uncharacteristic mental frailty in the @entity20			1
she began to repeat herself in discussions			1
but it was not just that her famed mental powers were dimming			1
@entity1 was having difficulties with her hearing as well			1
only her intimates were permitted to know that there was anything wrong with her			1
@entity1 , on a park bench in @entity31 enjoying the sunshine in march last year with her carer @entity33 one of the last pictures : @entity1 in @entity35 last year with her carers and police officer ' she could no longer follow an argument from beginning to end , ' said one close friend			1
' she would lose the point halfway through			2
it was very confusing for her and unsettling for us			2
it was hard for everyone			2
the hearing loss exacerbated the problem			2
' she was still functioning – and functioning well – but no longer at the extraordinary breakneck speed we were used to			2
it was difficult to know if she understood what was happening to her			2
if she did , she did n't tell us			2
' no one outside her inner circle knew of her condition			2
nor did anyone realise that , four years later , in august 2001 , @entity1 had a serious stroke while on holiday with her husband @entity59 ; they were marking their golden wedding anniversary on the @entity63 island of @entity64 , where they had honeymooned			1
on her return to @entity68 doctors realised she had also suffered a series of small strokes in the months before the holiday			1
@entity1 blithely insisted to friends that nothing was wrong			1
she had had the occasional stumble , she would admit , but nothing more			1
' i do n't think she could ever acknowledge the fact that she could be ill , ' said one close friend			1
great powers diminished : @entity1 patting a playful dog @entity80 was helped to her feet in @entity35 , south @entity31 , by her carers around that time she became patron of @entity84 , and it was not until many months later , in early 2002 , that the news of her failing health was made public by her office			1
then came the death of her beloved @entity59 in 2003 , after 52 years of marriage			1
it was a shattering blow to someone in such a fragile mental state			2
grief stricken , she slipped into depression and her mind deteriorated further			2
her daughter @entity97 revealed in her memoir that her mother actually often forgot that her husband had died			1
' i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again			2
every time it finally sank in that she 'd lost her husband of more than 50 years she would look at me sadly and ask softly , “ oh			1
were we all there ? ”			2
' @entity97 also disclosed in that memoir the exact moment she realised there was a problem			2
over lunch with friends in 2000 @entity1 , in a discussion about the war in @entity114 , inexplicably confused the former @entity115 with the @entity116 , arguably one of her greatest triumphs			1
' i almost fell off my chair , ' said @entity97			2
' watching her struggle with her words and her memory , i could n't believe it			2
i had always thought of her as ageless , timeless and 100 per cent cast - iron damage - proof			0
' bitter blow : @entity1 was devastated by the death of her beloved husband @entity59 ; the couple are pictured left on their wedding day in 1951 , and right a few months before his death in 2003 support : @entity1 with her daughter @entity97 visiting the @entity133 in @entity134 in june 2008 family : the former prime minister in 2011 with her son @entity137 and his wife @entity138 by now her doctors were insisting that she stopped making public speeches because she was on ever - stronger medication and her memory lapses were becoming more pronounced and more frequent			1
for her staff , at least , there were some advantages to the slowdown in the schedule			0
her fearsome temper tantrums became a thing of the past			0
@entity80 took on a new and more gentle persona			0
in 2005 she ignored the doctors to make a short stirring speech , with jokes , at the @entity155 in @entity156 at her 80th birthday party			0
the @entity158 and prince @entity159 were present along with virtually all of the men who served in her cabinets			0
after a faltering start , she was word perfect			0
it was the last public speech she was to make			0
in 2008 she was admitted to hospital for tests after she felt ill at a @entity168 dinner			1
it was the beginning of the end of her remarkable public life			0
aide : @entity173 , left , stayed loyal to her old boss until the end of @entity1 's life friends : the likes of @entity178 , left , and @entity179 , right , took turns visiting @entity1 at the @entity181 her absence from the wedding of prince @entity184 in april 2011 was the most significant sign of the deterioration in her health			1
in fact , one of her last public appearances was her faltering photocall on the steps of her home after she returned from two weeks in hospital in november 2010			0
by now , @entity1 , who once poignantly declared that ' home is where you go when you 've nowhere else to go ' , rarely left her four - storey home in @entity199			0
her constant companions were her devoted carers , @entity33 and @entity201 , and her ever - faithful police protection officers			0
trips out were increasingly rare			0
in january 2012 she did venture out , to a dinner party at the home of @entity207 , a former @entity6 cabinet minister who once dated @entity97			0
tragically , she seemed to be unaware who was prime minister			0
' she obviously did n't get who @entity209 was			0
i ca n't ever say i felt protective to her when she was in power , but i felt very lovingly protective towards her then , ' he said			0
in that late period of her life she also had the occasional lunch at the @entity181 , where staff always knew to serve chicken consomme and a main course of lemon sole ; to ask her preference would have led to too much confusion			1
there was one further , poignant sighting of @entity1 , on a park bench in @entity31 enjoying the sunshine in march last year with her carer @entity33			0
gone were her high heels , replaced by comfortable sandals and a walking stick – a testament to her frailty			0
then , at @entity232 , she went back to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder			0
when she came out she was even more uncertain on her feet , and a return home was out of the question			0
a police car outside @entity241 after @entity1 's death yesterday recuperation : @entity1 started the year convalescing at the @entity181 in central @entity31 after undergoing minor surgery over @entity232 tributes : notes and bouquets were piling up outside the former prime minister 's home in @entity31 following the news of her death so she moved quietly into a suite at the @entity181 – one of her favourite places – and she was invited by its owners the @entity258 brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future			1
her two carers took it in turns to stay with her			0
there were photos of @entity59 , her children and grandchildren on the mantlepiece in the suite			1
the same group of friends who took it in turns to see her in @entity199 were put on a rota at the @entity181			1
they included @entity275 , the wife of @entity276 who was one of the @entity6 ministers badly injured in the @entity279 bomb ; lord @entity178 , who was her foreign policy adviser ; @entity280 , another former minister ; @entity179 , the mp for @entity282 ; and @entity283 , who for more than two decades was her loyal private secretary			1
@entity173 , nicknamed @entity284 , who was her personal assistant in @entity285 , would stay for one or two weeks at a time			1
each day she was dressed immaculately			0
her trademark bouffant hair , elegantly coiffed , was now grey			0
by now it was n't just the memory loss which afflicted her			0
she was struggling to speak because she found it increasingly difficult to form words			0
it was why only those closest to her were permitted to the @entity181 to see her			1
sir @entity295 , her doughty press secretary at @entity285 , saw her a month ago			1
' she looked immaculate and was keen to get involved in the conversation			0
sometimes she started to speak and then the thought deserted her or she could n't get the words out			0
' he then added sadly : ' it never occurred to me that it would be the last time that i would ever see her			0
' @entity303 & @entity304 : how to make your voice heard if you believe @entity1 deserves a state funeral , and want the government to know , sign this online petition and submit it to us			0
we will pass it to the prime minister 's office at 10 @entity285			0
