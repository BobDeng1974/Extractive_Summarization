by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:36 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 23 september 2012 the environment secretary has been targeted by animal rights militants who have published photos of his home online as part of a campaign of ‘ intimidation ’ against a controversial badger cull			1
concerns : environment secretary @entity12 , who last week approved the badger cull trials @entity12 – who last week approved the cull in @entity15 to try to stop the spread of @entity17 among cattle – was forced to obtain a @entity20 injunction against the website , which also lists his address and office phone number			1
although activists removed the information , within hours it had reappeared on a ‘ mirror ’ site hosted in @entity28 but easily accessible in the @entity29 through a simple @entity31 search			1
the website claims a high - level @entity34 mole , sympathetic to their cause , went ‘ out on a limb ’ to leak the private details			1
it has also published addresses and phone numbers for senior @entity43 civil servants , board members of @entity44 , which is licensing the cull , and officials at the @entity47			2
the @entity48 is not revealing details of the website to protect those named			1
we have also established the identity of the @entity29 woman behind it but for legal reasons – linked to an unrelated police investigation – she can not be named			2
the site , which advises protesters to ‘ stay legal ’ , carries photographs of mr @entity12 ’s @entity61 home under the headline ‘ @entity63			2
@entity12 has a posh place ’			2
there is also an aerial shot and a view of the main entrance gates – key information for any extremist planning to trespass			1
it will also concern police given mr @entity12 ’s previous role as secretary of state for northern ireland , where he was an obvious target for terrorist groups			2
text on the anti-cull website boasts mr @entity12 is ‘ very , very angry about the site publishing his office phone number			1
many people are ringing it and playing the “ badger badger ” song to him ’			1
this is a reference to a @entity89 video in which cartoon badgers dance to a soundtrack			0
please put a few minutes to one side each day to contact them			0
’ @entity107 , director of policy at the @entity47 , said : ‘ we are very disappointed this has happened			0
we have asked @entity43 and @entity44 how this information could have been discovered			2
’ @entity44 declined to comment on the leak ‘ for security reasons ’			0
a @entity43 spokesman said last night that its databases had not been compromised			0
police are preparing for fast - track prosecutions against activists who launch night protests against the badger cull			1
farmers taking part have been asked to sign a police witness statement known as an @entity124 , saying they have not given permission for anyone to disrupt the cull			0
by collecting the forms in advance , police hope they can bring about charges more quickly			0
animal rights activists have been accused of using the travel website @entity134 to harass a farmer organising the badger cull			1
harassed : @entity137 @entity137 , 67 , says that militants have posted malicious reviews about his wife @entity140 ’s farmhouse b&b in an attempt to undermine her business			2
the comments appeared shortly after the names , addresses , emails and telephone numbers of farmers allegedly involved in the cull were published on the internet			0
mr @entity137 said : ‘ it was obvious they were by animal rights people			1
they said the smell was terrible and suggested it was caused by the badgers we had nailed to the wall			0
‘ there were similar comments and it was clear they were from people who had never been here			0
someone even wrote we would take guests badger - hunting			1
but it is deeply upsetting for my wife			0
’ although mr @entity137 ’s farm in @entity173 , near @entity174 , is outside the area of the @entity15 cull , he has become a target after agreeing to be a director of @entity179 – the firm set up to organise it			0
@entity134 has since taken down the offending review			0

website claims information came from a sympathetic high - level @entity34 mole
minister has been repeatedly called at office by animal rights ' militants ' who play a comedy badger song to him
