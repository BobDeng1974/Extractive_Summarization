@entity0 has told @entity1 to leave @entity2 and continue his career elsewhere – but says the midfielder is not prepared to take a pay - cut			1
@entity1 , who earns in the region of £ 60,000 - per - week , has played just 78 minutes for @entity2 this season in the @entity8 and has not started a league game since september 2013			1
and the 33 - year - old , who is out of contract in the summer , says it is ‘ burning him up ’ not knowing why he is not playing and claims when he went to see @entity0 to ask why , the discussion became heated and turned into a row			1
@entity1 has n't featured for @entity2 since the defeat by @entity18 in august @entity1 said he went to speak to manager @entity0 about his absence from the team but @entity0 said : ‘ @entity1 knows i have asked him to go on loan			1
but he is not going to go when he has a great deal here			0
‘ i ca n’t understand why someone does not want to play			0
we all get upset with people ’s attitudes , but he is not going to move			2
‘ it ’s not the player ’s fault			0
it is the person who gave him the contract , it ’s their fault ’ @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 have all shown interest in signing the player that @entity41 paid @entity42 £ 21million for in 2005 – only for the player to turn them all down			2
@entity0 also confirmed @entity2 would let @entity1 leave permanently on a free transfer – but says there has been no interest from anyone in the @entity50 and @entity51 clubs would not be able to match his current wages			1
@entity0 added : ‘ it is very difficult when you earn that much money to go and play anywhere else			1
‘ when you are earning x amount of pounds and somebody wants to pay you a fraction of that , you are not going to move			2
‘ now shifting him when he is not in your plans is difficult			0
’ @entity0 said @entity1 ( left ) did not want to leave @entity2 because of his ' fantastic ' contract @entity0 admits the midfielder ( left ) trains hard and does n't blame him for staying at the club the 67 - year - old boss claims to have a great relationship with the club 's hierarchy @entity1 is highly unlikely to feature for @entity2 in today ’s game with @entity71 at @entity72			1
and despite pressure mounting on @entity0 with his side in the bottom three , he does not feel the extra burden			2
he added : ‘ pressure is all self - inflicted			0
it ’s the pride of wanting to do well , that ’s what keeps us all going			0
none of us want to do badly , we all want to win			0
‘ i love my chairman @entity80 , but if he says to me ‘ @entity0 , we are going to go down a different route ’ then fine , it ’s his choice			2
what can i do ? ‘ you do your best			0
that ’s all i can do			0
’ @entity0 is not worried about his @entity2 job ahead of the visit of @entity71 on saturday			1
