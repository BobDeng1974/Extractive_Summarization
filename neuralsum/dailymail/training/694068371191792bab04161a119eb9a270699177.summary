by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity4 's @entity3 rugby team has been intimidating rivals with the traditional @entity6 for generations , but this kid just makes it look cute			1
@entity11 prior to the side 's four nation 's ruby union fixture against @entity15 , the young fan stands close to the television as his country 's famous rugby side prepares to perform the tribal challenge			1
in a crouch - like pose , he rises with the crowd flailing his arms and thumping his legs before striking his forearms in a convincing display of support for the world 's most formidable rugby side			2
predominantly associated with international rugby matches , the haka has also found its way into @entity4 's basketball sporting landscape			2
two videos showcasing the island nation 's paralympic basketball team and the @entity4 @entity57 at the @entity58 and the @entity59 respectively went viral			1
opponents of both sides were left bewildered when the basketballers suddenly broke - out into the traditional dance , hitting their wheelchairs and striking their limbs while chanting the @entity67 cry			1
in the @entity57 match against the @entity70 , the dream team was in the middle of their warm up for the big game when the @entity75 side got down to business with the pre-match routine			0
the psyche - out technique did n't work as well as did for their rugby counterparts , however , and the side was thumped 98 - 71			0
standing half - a - metre back from the television the youngster keeps his eyes firmly fixed on the television the toddler moves into the next phase of the dance by crossing his forearms together at the completion of the haka the toddler poses in front of the tv , apparently happy with his performance the @entity95 - which dates back to the 1880s - is best described as a traditional @entity67 dance which is performed in the form of ancestral war cries , choreographed movements , face - pulling and dancing			1
it is also performed to mark special occasions , as a welcome greeting , or to acknowledge remarkable achievements			0
perhaps more than any aspect of @entity67 culture , this complex dance is an expression of the passion , vigour and identity of the race			1
but the ferocity of the haka has not always been as intimidating as its current - day version			0
rather than tribal posturing it came across as just a bunch of white males dancing badly - which is perhaps best expressed in a video circulating from a match between the @entity3 and the @entity123 in 1973			2
the strangely choreographed version , featuring the all - white @entity3 squad , has been labelled one of the worst performances of all time			0
but 30 years on and the haka is a much more fierce display as players stand in the face of their opponents and gesture in a throat - slitting motion at the completion of the routine			0
it is essentially performed to give players an edge over their opponents before taking the field .			0

toddler *mimics* his heroes in the traditional @entity67 dance as they prepare to play

the *40* second clip sees him flailing his arms as he thumps his thighs
