what starts as classical music in the mind of @entity3 could morph into death metal if @entity5 , the striker he considers the best in the world , ruins another day for @entity9			1
curiously , the @entity9 manager might still find a way to enjoy it , judging from the praise he shovelled on the @entity13 in his pre-match briefing			1
perhaps flattery is the only way to disarm a finisher who pochettino rates higher than any other and whose three goals contributed to the two drubbings handed out by @entity23 to @entity9 last season			1
@entity3 , sensibly , cites that those debacles did not happen on his watch , but his significant task at the @entity42 today is ensuring that the striker who evokes @entity44 in his mind does n’t make a fool of him in the way he has @entity9 ’s previous two managers			1
‘ when @entity5 plays it is like classical music in my head , ’ @entity3 said			1
i think he is the best striker in the world			2
for me , he is			0
‘ it ’s like @entity44			0
@entity5 scored three times in two games against @entity9 last year as @entity23 took @entity9 apart twice @entity3 says neither @entity61 ( right ) or @entity62 ( left ) are strikers like @entity5 ‘ for me , @entity5 is the best			1
( @entity61 ) is not a striker striker , @entity62 is not a striker striker , but @entity5 is a striker			2
for me he is the best			0
everything you have to have as a striker , he has			2
‘ he is @entity13 like me but i am not biased			0
we need to make it difficult for him , to make the game difficult , to avoid the possibilities of him scoring			0
’ @entity5 has already notched five in the @entity38 this season , only four less than @entity9 ’s entire squad			1
other numbers are equally grim for @entity9 , not the least of which is the statistic that shows they have taken only two points from 10 games against last season ’s top four sides			2
@entity5 has already scored six times in just nine games this season as @entity23 seek to retain their title @entity3 says @entity9 have not watched last season 's defeats , when @entity5 helped put them to the sword it is , perhaps , why @entity3 referenced the primary ‘ need to show we can compete with a team like @entity23 ’ , though he has deliberately avoided all video evidence of their failure to do that last season			1
‘ you need to keep the good memories and good feelings and put the bad feelings and bad memories away , ’ he said			0
we need to keep the good feelings to improve			0
the past is the past			0
