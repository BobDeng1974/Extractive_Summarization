last week , a stranger told me how sexy i was			2
or rather , he told my friend @entity2 , with whom i was having dinner			2
‘ do you know how lucky you are to have such an attractive companion ? ’ the man asked him while i was at the bar			1
immediately , @entity2 puffed up to twice his size — but i could scarcely believe my ears			2
surely they did n’t mean me ? at the age of 70 ? perhaps this man needed his eyesight testing			2
who would n’t be ? no one ever paid me such a compliment when i was younger and had the looks to deserve it ; yet now , someone was honestly wowed by me			2
i ’m not exaggerating when i say this was n’t an isolated incident			2
over the past ten years , since my partner died , i have been besieged by dating offers from men in my age group			1
far from thinking that it ’s not possible to have a fulfilling sex life in later life , i have to tell you i ’m very satisfied			2
while i am still single , i do have a male friend ( not @entity2 ) whom i see every now and then			2
our relationship is not exactly romantic , but it is certainly red - blooded			1
in today ’s rather coy slang , it is a ‘ friendship with benefits ’			1
sex is in no way off the agenda because of my age			2
yes , it really is true — like many women my age , at 70 i ’m sexier than ever			1
even @entity2 later told me that he was in complete agreement with the stranger			2
‘ it ’s true , ’ he insisted , as i suppose he felt he had to			1
‘ you really have n’t lost your sex appeal			1
’ traditionally , sexiness is a short - lived commodity , fleetingly bestowed upon the young and quickly lost — like sand running through your fingers			1
@entity15 ( pictured ) says she sees women in their 60s and 70s everywhere who still think , ' look and act sexy ' in our 70s , goes the received wisdom , we become old crones and ‘ little old ladies ’ living out our days in a care home or alone in a one - bedroom flat with only a cat for company			1
we are grannies or aged spinsters , a burden to the @entity74 and even to our families			2
for someone of my age , sex appeal is supposed to be a distant memory			2
yet it simply is n’t true			2
when i look around me , i see dozens of women in their 60s and 70s who still think , look and act sexy			1
indeed , this is a generation that refuses to accept the passing of sexiness ; that rejects the notion we ’re past our prime the moment we pick up a pension			1
could it be , in fact , that we ’re just coming into it ? this is such a new and radical thought that it requires a significant culture change			1
but — and it ’s a big but — it does n’t just happen by itself			0
in my opinion , sexiness at our age has to be worked at			1
we might not be crones , but gone are the days when we can walk into a room with unbrushed hair , wearing a tacky t - shirt and flip - flops			1
that works for gorgeous 20 - year - olds , but not for us			1
after dinner , i talked about this at length with @entity2 , who is a psychologist and himself over 70			0
and , while his views may verge on stuffy , they do come from the horse ’s mouth			0
‘ in my view , all older women should dye their hair because grey or white immediately says : “ you ’re old , you ’re past it			1
” it says you do n’t care any more , ’ he says			1
‘ and most men , including myself , are not interested in a woman who does n’t care what she looks like			1
’ @entity15 says that celebrities like @entity130 ( pictured in 1969 ) show that older people can still be sexy and yes , we do have to submit to the pedicurist and manicurist , and wear make - up all the time			1
in order to keep the old chassis more or less on the road , we must polish it and buff it up			0
‘ you also have to smile , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ a young person can get away with looking moody , but there is nothing worse than a miserable old person			1
’ in fact , i admit to keeping several @entity149 beauty shops more or less in business these days			1
the local nail salon , brow bar , tanning shop and even the dentist thrive on my custom			0
i go to the gym , too , for while it might be possible to be sexy and overweight in your 20s , no one is going to ask for your number if you look flabby at 70			0
men will think your heart is about to give out , and the only new relationship you ’ll forge is with a cardiac surgeon			0
@entity167 , who is 68 , ( pictured in 2013 ) is an example of how women who are nearly 70 can have the energy and vibrancy that make them sexy i ’m afraid to say that a good figure at this age requires an intense effort — but it ’s worth every moment on the cross-trainer			1
at least nowadays there are gyms that cater for this level of vanity			0
it ’s also true that i have had some work done : a facelift five years ago that has held up reasonably well and removed a lot of the ‘ old lady ’ look			1
while this might be cheating , at £ 12,000 it certainly was n’t cheap			0
in any case , i do n’t regret it and am considering a tummy tuck , too — though whether i can put myself through the expense and trauma , not to mention the scarring , remains to be seen			0
i do n’t have any particular beauty regime			0
products by @entity198 have always seemed to me as good as anything more expensive			0
hands are a perennial problem , and over the years i have tried every kind of hand cream , from cheap to pricey to really very dear indeed — and none seem to make any difference			0
once again , the only real solution is a neck lift			0
and as for the decolletage : well , just do n’t have too much on show			0
yes , it all takes more time and effort every year			0
and , of course , i sound extraordinarily vain			0
i also never wear flat shoes , except trainers for the gym			0
but really it is about attitude — and i am certain that is what my admirer at dinner picked up on			0
i looked animated and lively and fun to be with — perhaps because i was dining with a relatively new friend rather than a grotty old husband of 50 years ( i ’m sure that helped , in any case )			0
energy and vibrancy are probably the sexiest qualities of all in older people			0
look at @entity130 , who is 75 , and @entity167 , nudging 70			0
look at the way they project and light up a stage — they are at least as sexy as they were 30 , 40 , even 50 , years ago			0
cosmetic surgery has helped them , too , but it ’s their lust for life that has truly kept them hot			0
and then there is the fantastic former ballerina dame @entity244 , still with a lithe dancer ’s body and working at the age of 89			0
i am not the only one enjoying herself so thoroughly at this late ( ish ) point in life			0
recently , a 70 - something girlfriend confessed that she was having a torrid affair with a married man , which , at any age , is morally dubious and extremely exciting			1
@entity15 also refers to former ballerina dame @entity244 ( pictured in 2014 ) who still has a lithe dancer ’s body and is working at the age of 89 because of this , she knows there is no future in the relationship and , in any case , he lives abroad so they can not meet very often			1
but he is so besotted with her that he skypes or phones at least five times a day , and is always emailing her love poems he has written			0
he is distraught when he can not make contact , and tells her she is the sexiest woman he ’s ever met			0
i wish i could say that she did n’t go to enormous efforts to remain attractive — but the opposite is true			0
i have never seen her without full make - up , manicured nails and high heels			1
she also always exudes a delicious but subtle aura of expensive scent — another little touch older women often forget			1
no wonder her lover ca n’t wait to get on a plane and book a five - star hotel			1
yes , we 70 - year - olds of today are sexy , youthful and raring to go			2
now all we ’re waiting for is men of the same age to catch up .			0
