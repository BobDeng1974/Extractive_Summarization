it has been long assumed that sharks are one of the more primitive forms of fish			2
but new analysis of a 415 million - year - old fossilised fish has shed doubt on the idea that sharks are the primitive forerunners of modern jawed vertebrates			1
modern - day sharks have internal skeletons made of cartilage , and do n't have any bony armour on the outside of their faces , unlike other fish living today			1
a fossilised 415 million - year - old fish called @entity21 ( shown above ) provides critical evidence for a well - developed external skeleton ( shown in blue ) in the shared ancestor of bony fishes and cartilaginous fishes such as sharks			1
this means that sharks are not as primitive as assumed , experts say now researchers from the @entity32 and @entity33 have suggested that modern sharks shed their bony skeletons early in their evolutionary history			1
when examining the fossil , they found it suggested that the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates , was not very shark - like			2
they used x-rays and ct scans to look inside the skull and found that the structure surrounding the brain was reminiscent of cartilaginous fish ( chondrichthyans ) such as sharks and rays			2
the fish fossil ’s ‘ two faces ’ led to it being named @entity21 after the double - faced @entity56 god @entity57			0
modern - day sharks have internal skeletons made of cartilage , but do n't have any bony armour on the outside of their faces , like other living fish			1
a blue shark accommpanied by a pilot fish is pictured the team of researchers from the @entity32 used x-ray micro ct scanning to build up a @entity70 image of the fossil enabling them to ' see ' inside the skull and brain case			2
by comparing the fossil to others from both bony and cartilaginous fish such as sharks , the team saw that it had features from both branches of evolution and additional features which are seen in much more primitive fish			2
the dual - sided nature of the specimen led them to rename it @entity21 , after the two - faced @entity56 god @entity57			0
although it 's rare to find a surviving brain case from this period , dr @entity89 says the fossil is n’t a ' missing link ' in our understanding of vertebrate evolution			0
‘ it 's misleading to think of evolution as a ladder which we reconstruct with “ missing links ” ’ he said			0
‘ it 's more accurate to think of it as a family tree , and research into evolution is like solving a puzzle			0
each new piece you find throws the surrounding pieces into context and helps you to understand them better			0
’ because of its external features , experts had wrongly thought it belonged to the bony fish family , osteichthyans , a group which includes familiar fish such as cod and tuna as well as all land - dwelling creatures with backbones			1
dr @entity124 of @entity32 ’s @entity125 said : ‘ this 415 million year - old fossil gives us an intriguing glimpse of the ‘ @entity129 ’ , when modern groups of vertebrates were really beginning to take off in an evolutionary sense			1
‘ it tells us that the ancestral jawed vertebrate probably does n’t fit into our existing categories			1
’ the scans revealed @entity21 lacks a division across the bottom of its brain case , which places it an early stage of evolution - but it also has a bony external skull			2
it shares features with two distinct evolutionary branches of early fish : those with skeletons of cartilage , like sharks , and the bony fish that went on to become land vertebrates and , ultimately , humans			1
@entity153 , such as sharks , have often been viewed as primitive , and treated as proxies for what the ‘ ancestral ’ jawed vertebrate would have looked like , largely due to their lack of bony skeleton , according to the study , published in @entity160			1
dr @entity124 explained : ‘ this mix of features , some reminiscent of bony fishes and others cartilaginous fishes , suggests that humans may have just as many features that you might call “ primitive ” as sharks			0
‘ losing your bony skeleton sounds like a pretty extreme adaptation but with remarkable discoveries from @entity174 , @entity21 strongly suggests that that the ancient ancestors of modern sharks and their kin started out just as ‘ bony ’ as our own ancestors			0
’ the fossil was previously thought to belong to the bony fish , osteichthyans , a group which includes familiar fish such as cod and tuna ( illustrated witha stock image ) as well as all land - dwelling creatures with backbones , but is now known to be an ancestor of the sharks too the fossil was found in @entity193 in 1972 and is currently held in the @entity194 at the @entity195 , @entity196			1
dr @entity89 from @entity33 ’s @entity198 spotted its potential in providing new insights into the period of evolution			0
he said : ‘ i knew straight away that this was a fossil that merited further investigation			0
‘ although @entity21 does have a bony skull - which led to it being first classified as a bony fish - it lacked many other features you ’d expect in that group			2
‘ it also lacked a feature seen in both early bony fishes and sharks , which is a division across the brain case			0
this clearly places it at an early stage of evolution , before the two branches split			0
‘ it shows that fish from this time , which are ancestors of both sharks and bony fish , had bones too , and sharks must have lost them at a later point			1
‘ @entity21 has helped us to look at sharks differently and will ensure they are no longer dismissed as being “ frozen ” at a primitive stage of evolution			0

researchers from the @entity32 and @entity33 have are - examined a 415 million - year - old fossilised fish found in the 1970s
it was previously thought to be a bony fish , but is now known to be an ancestor of such fish and also sharks
the ancestral jawed vertebrate does n't fit into any existing categories
@entity244 shows sharks lost their bony armour early in their evolution
and they are not as primitive and alike their ancestors as once thought
