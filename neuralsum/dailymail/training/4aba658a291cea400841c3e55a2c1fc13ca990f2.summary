space experts have warned there is a ' very real danger ' associated with a @entity4 satellite that is due to come crashing back down to earth on sunday			1
portions of the now - defunct @entity9 satellite will survive the high - speed re-entry to the planet and make a fiery , uncontrolled descent through the @entity14 's atmosphere , @entity4 officials have confirmed			1
of the utmost concern however is the location where the fragments will land , which remains unknown			0
' as of february 7 , 2014 the fragments are expected to fall on february 16 , ' colonel @entity18 told @entity4 news agency @entity19			1
the @entity9 was launched into by @entity4 in 1980 and classified as defunct the same year			1
@entity4 officials have now warned it will re-enter the earth 's atmosphere on sunday february 16 , however officials say they do n't know exactly where it will land			1
this is a stock image ' the exact impact time and location of the fragments from the @entity9 satellite may change due to external factors			1
' the satellite is expected to land somewhere in the @entity32 , which would pose no threat			1
however according to @entity36 , it could potentially fall anywhere on earth			2
in 1978 , a different decommissioned @entity9 satellite crashed into an unoccupied part of @entity41 , spreading radioactive debris and leading to a lengthy clean - up			2
then in 2009 , a third @entity9 satellite crashed at over 26,000 miles per hour with a @entity47 @entity46 telecommunications satellite , sending thousands of bits of space junk into orbit			2
most recently the @entity53 's @entity52 satellite managed to harmlessly crash into the ocean in november 2013			0
the exact size and weight of the @entity9 satellite is unknown , @entity19 reported , adding to the uncertainty of the upcoming event			2
the @entity52 satellite , which was sometimes referred to as the @entity61 of space because of its design , harmlessly crashed into the ocean in november 2013 ' much of it will burn up in @entity14 ’s atmosphere , but no doubt fragments of @entity9 will reach @entity14 , ' @entity65 , editor of @entity66 , told @entity36			1
' what we have going for us is that most of the planet is covered with water , and highly populated areas are in the minority of our planet ’s surface area			0
' so it is unlikely that satellite debris will cause injuries or major damage			0
still , with such a reentry , we are playing the odds			0
' this is a very real danger , given that a decaying orbit will carry this satellite down onto the planet			0
' as of october 2013 , more than 800 floating bits of space debris posed a potential threat to the @entity91 , according to @entity92			0
of these , 10 percent were spacecraft , either functional or non-operational , a third were rocket bodies , and the remainder were miscellaneous debris , the @entity93 noted in a recent newsletter .			0

the @entity9 was launched by @entity4 in 1980 and classified as defunct the same year
@entity4 officials have warned it will re-enter the earth 's atmosphere on sunday february 16
it 's descent is not controlled , so it can potentially land anywhere , experts say
it is expected to land in the @entity32
