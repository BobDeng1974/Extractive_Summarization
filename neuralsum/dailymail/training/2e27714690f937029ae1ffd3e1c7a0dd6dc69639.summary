the @entity20 in @entity4 could be a host venue at the @entity1 if @entity5 win the bid changes to @entity10 bidding rules to be decided in december could make it easier for countries in very hot climates to win the right to host the summer games , by allowing it to be staged at different times of year to the traditional july / august slot , and with more flexibility in putting on some events in a different city or even different country			1
