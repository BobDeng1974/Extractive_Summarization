a bumblebee declared extinct 24 years ago has been reintroduced to @entity1			0
fifty short - haired bumblebees were released this morning at a reserve in @entity4 , @entity5 where they had once thrived			1
the species used to be widespread in @entity8 but populations collapsed and it was last seen in 1988			1
for the past three years , farmers and local residents have been growing nectar - rich flowers such as vetches and red clover on their borders and meadows in preparation for their arrival , and setting up green ‘ corridors ’ linking farmland and nature reserves			1
decline : healthy honeybee populations are essential for agriculture and pollinations food security : much of the @entity28 's bee population is under threat from bacteria which cause @entity31 , which are difficult to destroy it is hoped the measures will help the bees create new colonies and re-populate other parts of the country			0
the short - haired is one of 27 species of wild bumblebee native to the @entity1			1
in previous decades , it was widespread in the south - east but also seen as far afield as @entity43 and @entity44			1
scientists backed by @entity8 , the @entity46 and the @entity47 captured 100 bees from a healthy population of the same species living in @entity51 in april			1
they were put in temporary hibernation and brought over to a quarantine facility at the @entity54 in @entity55 , for two weeks where they were screened for foreign parasites			0
half the batch were released yesterday morning at a wildlife reserve in @entity4			2
dr @entity60 , the project leader , said reintroducing species into the @entity1 had worked in the past with the red kite and the large blue butterfly			2
she said : ‘ it ’s a really exciting new scientific procedure , something which had n’t been attempted before with bumble bees			0
it ’s very exciting for the bee species to get a second chance			2
’ the short - haired bee population declined rapidly over a 60 - year period mainly due to habitat loss			1
since 1950 , @entity1 has lost 97 per cent of its flowering meadows			0
germs to kill germs ? researchers from the @entity77 , @entity78 believe viruses could be used to target the bacteria which cause the disease and have identified three that could become an effective treatment over the summer , the researchers will closely monitor the bee numbers and see if they expand into new areas			0
bees are vital for pollinating most of our food crops			0
a recent report by @entity90 estimated pollination by hand would cost £ 1.8billion pounds a year			0
the @entity47 said the project showed using ‘ bee friendly practices ’ in food production could be successful for farmers and bees			2
the conservation efforts in the area have already boosted numbers of other rare bees and helped other endangered creatures such as farmland birds and the brown hare			0
@entity105 , chairman of @entity8 said : ‘ the return of one of @entity1 ’s lost species is a cause for celebration			1
‘ this is a great example of the type of dedicated partnership between farmers , scientists and conservation organisations that can make a real difference for wildlife in this country			0
’ the project is part of @entity8 ’s @entity122 which tries to boost populations of rare insects , birds and mammals .			1
