many political observers feel that the plum post is a reward of sorts for @entity2 as her decision to lend her family name to the @entity1 campaign in 2008 as opposed to siding with the @entity40 , who would have been the country 's first female presidential nominee , was seen as a turning point in the competitive @entity38 primary			2
