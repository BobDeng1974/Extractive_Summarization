by @entity0 a sleek solar car , which uses the same amount of energy as a hairdryer , has won the @entity5 for the fifth consecutive time			1
dubbed @entity6 , the @entity8 car won the eight - day , 1,700 - mile ( 2,735 km ) as it travelled through seven states using solar power			1
the event started on july 20 in @entity12 , @entity13 and ended on monday in @entity14			1
@entity8 won the race despite an early 20 - or 30 - minute setback when the motor failed and needed to be swapped			1
five of the 22 other teams passed @entity8 in the process			2
electricity produced by the solar panels of the car were stored in a pack of lithium - ion batteries and used to power the small direct current motor mounted at the rear hub			1
the unit only produces three horsepower , but that was enough to allow @entity6 to race at an average 60 miles per hour			0

as @entity6 approached the finish line around noon , teammates cheered around the sidelines while race crew member @entity23 waved the checkered flag to ensure a level playing field in the @entity52 , all teams relied on 516 photovoltaic panels , or solar cells , made in @entity52 and patched together in @entity55			1
but each entrant had to develop their own @entity58 ( @entity58 ) system , which connects inverters , battery chargers and other devices to optimise the car 's performance			0
the skill and key to winning wasunderstanding the course and detecting the angles of the sun 's rays during a day 's racing , starting at 9am and ending at 6pm local time , with each team using four drivers			0
the @entity6 car had previously taken third in the @entity75 in @entity76 in 2011 and first in the @entity52 race in 2012			1
it is the team â€™s 11th vehicle and car weighs in at just around 320lbs ( 145 kg ) without a driver			0
the 16 - foot - long ( 4.8 metre ) @entity6 stretches about 10 inches ( 25.4cm ) beyond the length of an original 1965 @entity83 and is around 37 inches ( 93cm ) tall			0

for the entire day , the @entity87 challenged @entity8 to be first across the line			2
throughout the trip , the two teams moved between first and second , even driving alongside one another on a few occasions			0
in the end , @entity6 prevailed , defeating @entity95 to win the stage by a mere 45 seconds			0
' this is n't just a win , ' said @entity98 , project manager and junior industrial and operations engineer			0
' it 's a win after one failure after another			0
we 've learned so much from that - how to work as a team and how to help each other out			0
i 'm excited for the next @entity75			2
