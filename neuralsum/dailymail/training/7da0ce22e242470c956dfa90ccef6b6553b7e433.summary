each year , up to 2 million bikes are stolen around the world , despite many being locked to railings or lamposts			0
to cut the hassle and cost of these thefts , a pair of engineers has created a smart bike lock that not only alerts the user if someone tries to steal their bike , it can also inform their family if they have an accident			2
called @entity19 , the gadget is solar - powered and connects to a smartphone app via @entity21 so owners can keep an eye on their bike wherever they are			1
it detects tampering and force using a built - in triaxial accelerometer @entity25 weighs 2.5lbs ( 1.13kg ) and the firm claims it can withstand 7,000lbs of force			2
equipped with a triaxial accelerometer to detect if the lock is being tampered with , the @entity19 will send an alert to the company ’s cloud servers , which in turn will be sent to the owner via a smartphone app. the system is not completely free of false alarms , but the sensitivity can be controlled through the app. similarly , if the owner has an accident on their bike , or if they are hit by a car , the app sends a crash alert to friends and family about the incident			1
solar panels on the base of the lock keep the sensors activated , and the firm states an hour of full sunlight provides enough energy to run the lock for a week			0
it can also be charged via usb and a fully charged battery should run for a month			0
the smart lock was created by former @entity72 engineer @entity71 with @entity74 employee @entity73			2
the pair has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $ 50,000 ( £ 29,700 ) for production of the device and , if successful , the @entity19 should start shipping early next year			2
people who pre-order the lock can currently get it for $ 159 ( £ 95 ) , although this is a limited offer			1
the lock is expected to retail for $ 249 ( £ 149 ) once it ’s widely available			1

crash alerts are also sent to friends and family if the owner has an accident and the sensitivity of the lock can be managed in the app 's settings similarly , if the owner has an accident on their bike , or if they are hit by a car , the app will send a crash alert to friends and family about the incident			1
solar panels on the base of the lock keep the sensors activated , and the firm states an hour of full sunlight provides enough energy to run the lock for a week			0
it can also be charged via usb and a fully charged battery should run for a month , although a fully depleted lock takes about five hours to fully recharge			0
@entity25 is compatible with @entity134 devices that have @entity135 , running @entity136 or later			0
it is also compatible with @entity139 phones and tablets rubbing @entity141 ( 4.3 ) or @entity142 ( 4.4 )			0

@entity25 was built by a former @entity72 engineer and @entity152 employee
it is solar - powered and connects to a smartphone app via @entity21
a built - in accelerometer can tell if the lock is being tampered with
it then sends an alert to the company and the bike 's owner via the app
crash alerts are also sent to friends and family if the owner has an accident
the lock can be pre-ordered for $ 159 ( £ 95 ) but is expected to retail for $ 249 ( £ 149 ) when it starts shipping next year
