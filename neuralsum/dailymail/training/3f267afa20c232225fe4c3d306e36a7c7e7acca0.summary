renowned auctioneers @entity7 's of @entity8 thought a fan had painted the study of @entity11 in homage to @entity3 's famous 1831 work , and so valued it at just £ 500			1
a collector snapped it up for £ 3,500 in june 2013 but after taking a closer look they suspected the original artwork had been painted over			1
@entity8 auctioneers @entity7 's thought a fan had painted the study of @entity11 ( pictured ) in homage to @entity23 artist @entity3 's famous 1831 work			1
@entity7 's sold it for £ 3,500 , but the painting was found to be an original work after the buyer realised it had been painted over restorers were called in to remove the added brushstrokes , and to the new owner 's delight the oil painting was confirmed by scholars to be an original work by the @entity36 artist himself			1
experts say the previously unknown painting is one of several preparatory sketches @entity3 did before creating the masterpiece ' @entity43 ' , which was bought by the @entity45 last year for £ 23.1million			1
after being catalogued by one of the world 's leading authorities on @entity3 , the painting was relisted with auctioneers @entity50 's with an estimate of £ 2million , 4,000 times the original estimate			1
but after an intense bidding war the painting was sold to an unnamed bidder who forked out a staggering $ 5million - around £ 3.5million - including the auction house 's fees			1
a spokesman for @entity50 's said : ' it is a wonderful result			1
' prior to its sale in 2013 the 18in by 24in painting had been in a collection amassed in the @entity63 by @entity64 , founder of the high street stationary chain			2
it hung on the walls of @entity69 in the @entity70 , home to his descendants the @entity74 , until the @entity76 property was sold in 2007			2

the painting was owned by @entity77 ( left ) until she decided to sell it via @entity7 's of @entity8 because she ' longer had room for it ' experts said the painting is one of several preparatory sketches @entity3 did before creating the masterpiece ' @entity43 ' ( above ) , which was bought for £ 23.1million last year but specialists apparently failed to spot that the painting of @entity11 was an original , instead listing it as being painted by ' a follower of @entity3 '			1
it was valued at £ 500 to £ 800 and sold for £ 3,500 to the lucky , anonymous buyer who then realised the painting had been heavily retouched in what experts say was a ' misguided attempt ' to ' finish ' it			1
industry specialists say @entity107 will have a case to sue @entity7 's if it can be proven the auctioneers did not carry out due diligence when checking the work			2
prior to the auction @entity114 , a leading authority on the artist and former curator at the @entity45 , said @entity3 paintings could be tricky to attribute to the artist but she stood by her view that it was an original			2
she said : ' the buyer in 2013 will have taken an well - informed punt on this painting , which had a very low estimate , and then got it cleaned			2
' not everyone who takes a punt is going to get it right but on this occasion they did			0
