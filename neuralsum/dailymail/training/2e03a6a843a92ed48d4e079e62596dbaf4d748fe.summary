by @entity1 reporter published : 17:00 est , 22 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:10 est , 22 february 2014 all natural : @entity5 has not had botox , says her dermatologist she 's admitted to having boob jobs , but @entity5 has never used botox , fillers or lasers , says her dermatologist			1
dr @entity12 claims the 39 - year - old transformed what was uneven , acne - blighted skin into a smooth and blemish - free face simply by paying attention to her lifestyle and skincare regime			1
he said : ‘ @entity5 is a natural beauty			1
' she ’s an incredible health nut – she watches her diet , her exercise , she sort of leads an ideal healthy life			1
' she ’s an example of how skincare products can be used to convince tissue to heal itself from the outside in and the inside out			1
’ the @entity32 medic added : ‘ she suffered badly from acne but [ her skin now ] is totally self resolved			1
' she pays meticulous attention to product use and lifestyle			1
‘ and i supervised all of it so i assure you nobody has touched her with any surgical implements or lasers			1
' she ’s an example of self discipline			1
‘ i always advise acne patients to modify their diets so they have no dairy intake , no caffeine intake , and next to no sugar			1
' this means their carbohydrate intake has to be under 20 per cent of their calorific intake			1
‘ i ’m the only skin doctor who she ’s ever seen , so trust me on this one			1
’ a more competitive type of indoor cycling class , devised by @entity63 fitness experts , is attracting an array of celebrity fans , including @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
called @entity71 , it combines powerful music and uplifting instruction with a new , high - tech ‘ torq pack ’ which measures your speed and power to give a race ranking and exact calorie - burn count			2
‘ flywheel is extremely fun because i ’m a little bit competitive , ’ said @entity66 , right			2
‘ during the sprints , you can see where you ’re ranking in the class and go harder to make your number better			2
’ winning streak : flywheel combines music and instruction with a high - tech ¿ torq pack ¿ which measures your speed and power to give a race ranking the class ’s co-founder , @entity95 , says : ‘ @entity66 loves our intense , inspiring classes and the technology			2
’ the first class opened in @entity101 last year , at @entity102 , and there are now plans to extend further into the @entity104			2
cranberry juice could make your body healthier overall , says new research			2
adults who regularly consumed the drink had better cardiovascular profiles than those who did n’t – even though there was no difference in overall calorie intake , said the @entity118 study			0
drinking cranberry juice – which has long been a go - to drink for cystitis – was associated with smaller waist measurements , a reduced likelihood of being overweight or obese and a lower risk of infection or inflammation			0
all in your head : agony may be ' all in the mind ' people who believe their pain will have catastrophic effects feel it more severely – meaning pain may be ‘ all in the mind ’ , says research			0
psychological factors are increasingly seen to have a major impact on how much you feel pain , explaining why different people have different pain thresholds			0
the study of 100 patients with knee arthritis tested how much they ‘ catastrophised ’ pain and how badly they felt on six - minute walks			0
the research at @entity150 , @entity151 , showed that the more patients feared pain from walking , the more pain they actually felt			0
and the amount of pain felt can have an impact on recovery as that often requires exercise			0
@entity160 of @entity161 says : ‘ it ’s always been a strange phenomenon that people with osteoarthritis , who may have the same amount of cartilage damage , have completely different levels and experiences of pain			0
‘ there is a large “ psycho - social ” aspect to chronic pain			0
we ’re carrying out research looking at the way the brain processes pain , anticipation of pain and whether there are abnormalities in brain mechanisms , which if targeted , could offer a more effective way of dealing with chronic pain than traditional painkillers			0
’ yoga really can create positive physical changes in the body , new research reveals			0
a study by @entity195 looked at 200 breast cancer survivors who had never practised yoga before			1
@entity199 were given twice - weekly 90 - minute sessions for three months while the other half continued not to practise it			0
blood tests taken before and after the three months showed that cytokines – proteins in the blood that can show inflammation – were lower by ten to 15 per cent in those doing yoga			0
one theory is that yoga aids sleep and cuts stress , which in turn reduces inflammation .			0
