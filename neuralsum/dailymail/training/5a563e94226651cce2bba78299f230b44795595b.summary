it can cause major problems in water supplies , kill off fish and even give humans nausea , numbness and liver disease			1
now the problem of algae in lakes has got so bad , @entity7 is using a special sensor on the @entity12 to monitor it from orbit			1
the space agency has already released a stunning series of images showing the effect algae can have on @entity19 's lakes			1
on the right is an image created by scientists to better show off the algae			1
the @entity21 is mounted to the exterior of the orbiting laboratory			0
it provides a way for researchers to see 90 wavelengths of light not visible to the human eye			0
this can help with research on harmful algal blooms ( @entity44 ) because they , along with other organic materials , have a ' spectral signature			1
' the biological matter emits a unique wavelength as it absorbs and scatters solar energy , resulting in fluorescence and backscattering			0
essentially the light reflects back to @entity23 , which reads the data like a fingerprint			0
' if you 've been watching recent news of algal bloom concerns in @entity27 , you know that the right conditions for algae can lead to contamination of local water sources , potentially impacting aquatic life and humans , ' @entity7 said			1

researchers can use the information from @entity23 to ' see ' what they 're missing with their own senses			0
with it they study biological and chemical signatures for aquatic and terrestrial materials			0
this can reveal the presence of microscopic plants , organic compounds , suspended sediments and other factors controlling water quality			0

' historically , blooms have been visually observed by the naked eye due to the discoloration of the water , ' said @entity108 , @entity109 , principal investigator for the @entity112 - @entity111 project			2
' now optical sensors can detect these changes in the color of the water and quantitatively measure the spectral radiance changes due to algae blooms			1
' in the @entity27 area researchers are looking at phytoplankton and algal blooms that occur regularly in summer months , often in the harmful quantities found this year			2
of particular concern are blue - green algae @entity124 , which can cause health concerns in humans such as nausea , numbness or dizziness — potentially leading to liver damage			1
once airborne in sea spray , the brevetoxin producing @entity44 karenia brevis — known as red tide — can go beyond irritating the eyes and lungs of coastal visitors , according to @entity108 , as it is capable of killing fish , birds and marine mammals			2
no human fatalities are directly attributed to brevetoxins , he goes on to say , though it is possible to reach fatal toxin levels during @entity148 blooms ' unlike conventional multi-spectral images , the high spatial and spectral resolution afforded by @entity23 enables us to develop new approaches to more fully utilize hyperspectral data to distinguish @entity44 species from space , ' said @entity108			2
' conventional multi-spectral ocean color imagery in general does not contain sufficient information to discriminate between bloom species , but @entity23 's contiguous bands collect information that can enable us to identify the species			0

researchers at the @entity111 - @entity164 have used @entity23 's ability to show visible and near infrared wavelengths to follow the @entity27 blooms for years			2
the most recent @entity23 data collections for the area took place in mid-august as the station passed over the @entity172			0
this information , in addition to ground data and other resources , can help with developing and validating bloom - detection algorithms .			0

scientists are using *instrument* on @entity12 to monitor growth of algae
huge ' blooms ' can kill off fish and even give humans disease
