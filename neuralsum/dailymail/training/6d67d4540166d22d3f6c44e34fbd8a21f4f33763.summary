by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 11:19 est , 24 january 2014 perhaps even penguins feel they need to get something off their chest - and this young chick from @entity6 is no exception			2
like many others in the huge colony spotted on the @entity11 , the penguin chick is only half - way through the moulting process , with thick patches of brown fur still visible on its body			1
photographer @entity18 travelled from his native @entity19 to the remote island near the @entity21 in the southern @entity22 to capture these striking images of the flock , which can sometimes number 200,000			1
squaring up : this @entity25 from @entity6 has a distinctive look while going through the moulting process fur coat : the younger chicks wait behind on the banks waiting for their parents to return with food waxing lyrical : the chicks , still sporting patches of brown fur , watch for their parents the 46 - year - old said : ' after many visits to @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , i fell in love with the harsh nature of the extreme north and south			1
' i went to the @entity11 on @entity6 , which is known for being the home of large breeding colonies of huge royal penguins			2
' @entity49 were laying eggs and raising their chicks on the island and , at times , there can be up to 200,000 penguins there			2
' the shaggy , brown bird in one of the photographs - a king penguin chick - waits on the bank for its parents who go to the sea to get food			0
' when they return , the parents seek out their young among the thousands of same brown penguins			0
' individual features of the penguins allows the fur to stay on parts of the body longer than others			0
' the keen photographer from @entity76 , @entity19 , added : ' it 's such an amazing sight			0
you can imagine what it feels like to be confronted by such a huge army			0
' feathered army : at times , 200,000 penguins can gather on @entity11 , @entity6 ruffle the feathers : this young chick 's thick brown fur will make way for a more adult appearance fur today : this pair of penguins will soon look remarkably different			1
