the logos of @entity9 and @entity10 are repeatedly shown in cars being driven by celebrities in the hit car show hosted by @entity14 - despite a ban such items being given ' undue prominence '			1
@entity19 , which along with @entity10 is owned by @entity20 , has highlighted its involvement with @entity1 on its @entity23 and @entity24 pages , the @entity18 reported			1
mention of the show was absent from their pages this morning			2
branded : while actor @entity32 drives , the logos of @entity19 seats and @entity10 harnesses are clearly visible , which breaches @entity3 rules on product placement @entity35 , 59 , managing director of @entity19 and @entity10 , was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 1993 for smuggling more than 41 kilos of cocaine worth £ 6 million into @entity38 stashed in a trailer belonging to his racing team			1

and again : the @entity10 and @entity53 logos are clearly visible when actor @entity54 takes the wheel			1
@entity3 rules on branded products say a wide range must be used so that no brand receives ' undue prominence ' but @entity61 , the show 's executive producer , admitted they had broken guidelines on making reference to trade names , brand names and slogans , which must always be ' clearly editorially justified '			1
in addition the @entity3 is not permitted to accept ' free or reduced cost products ' in return for credits			1
frontman : @entity14 presents the show alongside @entity75 and long - suffering @entity76 @entity19 ’s products feature in the @entity78 in a @entity80 section of the show , in which celebrities drive a @entity82 around a racetrack			2

he told the paper that @entity82 had installed the branded seats and the harnesses			0
mr @entity61 said that when he asked @entity82 about them , @entity82 said they had received the seats and the harnesses for free			2
but he added that it was his job to check product placement rules , not @entity82 's			0
' i will be putting it right			0
i am bang to rights			0
i am going to pay @entity53 and take the logos away , ' he told the @entity18			1
' we have never given them prominence over the years because we have different manufacturers for @entity78 in a @entity105			0
' this slipped under the radar			0
' speaking last year , @entity35 said he had paid for his crime and wanted to put it behind him			2
he told @entity111 's sunday @entity110 : ' this is something i can never get away from but it is something for which i have been punished and which i would like to put behind me once and for all			0
' but people just wo n’t let me do that			0
' i have been lucky enough to be given the opportunity to get back into the industry that i love			0
' people should view me as a glittering example of prison working properly , not jump on me every time i do something new			0
' his first company , @entity35 , was liquidated after police became suspicious of the number of times his team tested at @entity132 's @entity131 circuit			1
@entity35 and others were convicted in 1993 of importing drugs hidden in their race transporters .			2
