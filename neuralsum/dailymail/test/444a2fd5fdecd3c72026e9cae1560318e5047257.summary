it 's a skill more often seen performed by @entity2 squadron the @entity3 or the @entity5 @entity4			0
but in this incredible video , one passenger captured the moment two passenger aircraft landed perfectly in sync at @entity10			2
as the two planes exit the cloud and approach the runway , this quick - witted passenger realised his seat was the perfect spot to video the respective landings			1
the two planes begin their descent simultaneously at @entity10 in astonishing video captured by a passenger on one of the planes , both aircrafts ' wheels touch the tarmac at the same time what resulted was the planes , one an @entity29 , landing at the same time on adjacent runways			1
as well as the two measuring their approach almost identically , the wheels touch the tarmac simultaneously			1
@entity34 , from the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , told @entity37 : ' what we ’re seeing here is ‘ closely spaced @entity42 operations ’ in practice – a safe and normal procedure at airports around the world			1
' @entity10 has two pairs of parallel runways , separated by just 750 feet			0
other airports such as @entity50 and @entity51 have similar runway configurations and operations			2
the two planes come through the clouds to begin their similar descent to the ground ' although pilots are used to this type of approach , it does result in a very interesting view out of the window for passengers			2
' plane landings are seen by many as a work of art in themselves for many tourists and enthusiasts alike			0
probably the most famous , and incredible , is the landings of passenger planes on the @entity73 island of @entity74			0
on board it was silent , which helped the person videoing maintain their concentration to film the scene approaching @entity80 , aircraft come astonishingly close to those relaxing on @entity83 that makes for terrific footage			1
@entity83 is located on the @entity87 side of the @entity73 island of @entity74 , in the territory of @entity89			0
aircraft are forced to land so close to the beach so as to touch down near the start of the short runway 10 , which is 2,300 metres in length			1
as a result the area is popular with plane spotters and many of the surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach display airline departure and arrival timetables			0
the plane landings at @entity74 's @entity80 have become legendary worldwide			0

video shows the planes approaching the runway at the same speed
the two aircraft maintain this as their wheels touch the tarmac
aviation *expert* calls the manoeuvre ' closely spaced @entity42 operations '
