by @entity0 and @entity1 incredible footage has emerged of two oil workers running for cover as they try to avoid being caught up in a tornado as it swept through a trailer park			1
@entity8 began filming as the vortex touched down in an oil field south of @entity11 , @entity12 , on monday			1
the massive twister injured nine people , severely damaged 15 trailers and ruined equipment at the @entity17 , about five miles outside the city			1
' he adds : ' we 've got nowhere to go			2
it 's heading right for us			2
i do n't want to be sitting here			2
' one of the pair then grab the keys to their pickup truck so they can take refuge in the front seats			1
sat in the cabin , they watch as the tornado carries on its path of destruction alongside the vehicle			2
' i do n't know where it 's going ' : the vortex appears to stop as the pair are in the cabin of the vehicle with the windows to the vehicle open , they start shouting : ' look at everybody just running			2
' the vortex then appears to stop next to the vehicle and the pair say : ' it 's just sitting there			0
' i ca n't tell which way it 's going			0
it looks like it 's breaking apart			0
' baseball - sized hail fell during the storm and the tornado was on the ground for an entire minute , witnesses said			1
cloud : dirt and debris flies across the caravan park as the tornado sweeps through the area a woman who captured another video of the vortex can be heard repeatedly praying and saying ' we 've got nowhere to go ' as a man in the background kept shouting to people that a tornado was coming			1
the desperation and panic in her voice is haunting			0
one witness posted to @entity96 that the twister started on a @entity99 oil field , but @entity100 was not able to independently confirm			0
massive : the tornado stuck the @entity17 , about five miles outside of @entity11 , @entity12 from afar : a picture taken a few miles from the dangerous storm shows how large it was the critically injured person is currently being treated in a local hospital , officials said			1
the other eight were treated and released			0
an initial report by @entity112 suggested a trailer with four children in it had gone missing , but all people were later accounted for , officials said			1
a shelter was set up for people whose homes have been destroyed , an official told in @entity121			1
of the 15 trailers damaged , 15 were completely destroyed , @entity122 reported			1
devastating : a total of 15 trailers housing oilfield workers were destroyed , eight entirely destroyed : about half of the 15 trailers damaged by the twister were completely destroyed ' oh my @entity130 ' : the woman who took this video is heard desperately praying over and over again for safety from the terrifying tornado @entity136 , who works for a trucking company , said that he was in @entity11 with some co-workers when the tornado warning came			1
they had just moved their vehicles inside because of large hail when they spotted the funnel cloud			0
" we saw it form , come out of the sky , hit the ground and go back up into the clouds , " he said			0
@entity136 , 38 , took photos of the twister and estimated that it remained on the ground for nearly a minute			0
he said he could n't see any debris			0
' it was a little bit too far away			0
we just saw the clouds and the rotation , ' he said			0
the tornado warning for the area was later lifted , but @entity161 emergency management officials were asking people to stay off the roads because emergency vehicles were having a difficult time reaching the scene			1
the oil boom has fueled a population boom for the area , bringing in tens of thousands of people looking for work			2
close up : this terrifying shot was taken right near the tornado , the photographer appears to have cheated death to take it dangerous : baseball - sized hail rained down on the surrounding area , destroying everything it hit beat up : @entity179 dented this truck in multiple places and smashed its windshield cracked : this windshield was all but smashed in by the giant hail many live in hastily - assembled trailer parks or man camps , which contain pre-fabricated structures that can resemble military barracks			1
some companies rent blocks of hotel rooms for employees to live in , and some workers sleep in their cars or even tents			2
housing developments are constantly popping up in big areas of town that did n't exist on maps a couple of years ago			2
but they are still not enough to keep pace with demand and oil money has pushed rents to among the highest in the nation , even rivaling trendy neighborhoods in the country 's largest cities			0
a simple one bedroom apartment in the oil boom hub city of @entity212 can easily cost $ 2,000 per month in rent			0
even a spot to park a trailer can cost over $ 800 per month			0
@entity11 , is about 30 miles southeast of @entity212 .			1
