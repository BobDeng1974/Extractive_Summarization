he said @entity147 : sweetie one of two pandas on loan to @entity17 zoo for ten years at a cost of £ 600,000 per year			0
zoo bosses are hoping that they will reproduce			0
in response to the inclusion of @entity39 on the list , @entity154 mp @entity153 said : ' whilst we all love a good panda story , in a year when @entity160 became head of the @entity104 , or @entity162 became prime minister of @entity164 or even the sad death of @entity166 , its frustrating the @entity2 could n't think of 12 human female faces who have made the news this year			1
' these lists are n't meant to be serious but coming so soon after the lack of women from their @entity2 award it does seem as if the @entity2 has n't noticed the wide and varied contribution women make to public life			1
' a @entity2 spokeswoman said : ' @entity39 ( @entity13 ) as one of the annual headline makers was a light - hearted addition to the list , and this is n't the first time it has featured a non-human			1
in 2009 , @entity184 , a much - caught giant fish , was august 's entry on the male list and last year @entity188 the @entity189 was on the female list for april			0
' the bears were brought to @entity192 from @entity18 in the hope that they will produce cubs			0

one user of the site , who tweets under the name campaigner , wrote : ' i 'm rather torn over £ pandagate			0
these things are never just black or white			0
' the article was written up by freelance reporter @entity208 , who told the @entity209 the list was put together by @entity2 editors			1
responding to the debate , which sent the @entity198 hashtag # pandagate trending , @entity208 tweeted : ' i did n't choose the @entity2 women faces of the year subjects , just wrote them			1
two black eyes from wife though			0
pandamonium ! ' twitter users also complained at the selection of women came to prominence simply because of high - profile weddings , such as @entity113 who married @entity116 of @entity117 , and the @entity134 billionaire the @entity130			0
and the worth of a place on the list of a @entity71 marine who used @entity141 to ask @entity143 to take her to the @entity144 , as corporal @entity231 did , has also been called into question			0
unsurprisingly the @entity233 was connected with the royal wedding , but while the @entity237 version of the @entity2 's list had @entity91 , the woman who designed @entity239 of @entity241 's wedding dress , as the entry for that month , worldwide audiences were offered the more recognisable figure of @entity244 , whose worthiness of a place on the list many may also doubt .			1
