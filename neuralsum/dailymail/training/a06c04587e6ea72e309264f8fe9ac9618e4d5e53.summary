by @entity0 published : 07:19 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 20:42 est , 21 november 2012 the sight of mounted police units could be banished to the history books after a number of forces revealed they had scrapped the use of police horses to save money			1
the units , commonly used to police large events such as football matches , are under threat as police forces across the country try to make savings in light of budgetary cutbacks			1
the decision has been criticised as ' myopic ' by policing bodies who said that the closure of police units is ' too important to lose completely '			2
under threat : a mounted police officer raises his baton among protesters at @entity27 power station in 2008			2
but mounted patrols face closure as forces across the country look for ways to save money public order : police horses control a crowd during riots at @entity38 , @entity39 , in 1936			1
the protesters had gathered to demonstrate against a fascist march held by the @entity42 police horses were widely used across the country to police last summer 's riots , leading some officers to question the decision to close the units to make savings			1
@entity50 and @entity51 forces decided to get rid of their stables earlier this year , while three other forces are reported to be relocating their stables into one amalgamated operation at a separate location			1
it is thought that @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity61 police forces have decided to amalgamate their operations , which could lead to a decrease in the size of the individual units			1
the cutbacks have prompted the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) to consider commissioning a study aimed at protecting the @entity71 's remaining 14 mounted patrols			1
the study , which would be carried out by two academics from @entity73 , would look at the cost of the units and hope to show how they deal with public order offences			1
@entity68 's @entity78 said that a study would emphasise the value of mounted patrols to @entity71 policing			1
feeling the heat : a mounted police patrol races through the streets in @entity86 during the riots in august last year line of defence : officers on horseback form a cordon across @entity92 during a tuition fees protest			0
but police organisations fear that mounted patrols could be scrapped as forces make cutbacks the @entity99 's @entity98 said that closing forces had already lost ' invaluable experience forever ' and said police horses were ' essential ' for effective policing			1
speaking to @entity104 , mr @entity98 said : ' to reduce or disband mounted branches is extremely myopic			0
' once numbers fall below a certain level , we will have lost invaluable experience forever and it will be hard to regain the experience which we as a federation believe is essential for even basic quality policing of big public order events or high pro-file policing			1
' on occasions savings of this type may end up costing the service more in the long run			0
' police horses at football and other public order situations or high profile community can reduce the total number of officers required at the event considerably			1
' @entity50 's unit was disbanded earlier this year , reportedly saving the force £ 105,000 a year			1
' four of the serving horses have been retired to private homes or went to sanctuaries , ' said a spokesman			2
' the remaining three continue in active service with @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
' @entity51 announced it was to disband the unit in october , blaming ' increasing financial pressures '			1
the force said the cutbacks would save approximately £ 600,000 but said that it made the decision with ' great reluctance '			0
assistant chief constable @entity140 said : ' we know that the public , police officers and staff hold the @entity145 in great affection and the unit has provided great service over the years			2
mounted police push protesters away from a demo at the @entity151 in april 2009 ' however the financial pressures we face need to be met head on and inevitably difficult decisions have to be made			0
' the disbanding of the @entity145 will lead to approximately £ 600,000 of savings annually and the decision to remove these posts is part of the on - going planned reduction of police officer numbers over the four year reform change programme			0
' officers based within the unit will take up new roles elsewhere in the force and staff members will be eligible for redeployment			0
' a detailed plan for the disbanding of the unit is now being progressed			0
if we were not to have taken this decision , then @entity51 would have had to lose an even greater number of officer posts from across the force			2
' securing a good home for the horses will continue to be paramount and we will explore all avenues to achieve this including transferring them to other forces			2
' police horses were first used in @entity39 in 1760 , when sir @entity182 , the @entity183 magistrate , developed a plan to introduce mounted units in order to deal with highwaymen			1
the initial introduction of eight horses proved so successful that a patrol of more than 50 horses was put in place in 1805			2
wearing red waistcoats , blue coats and trousers , the @entity193 gave protection on all major roads within 20 miles of @entity199			0
police horses were first used in @entity39 in 1760 , when sir @entity182 , the @entity183 magistrate , developed a plan to introduce mounted units in order to deal with highwaymen mounted police take charge at @entity206 while casualties are removed from an overcrowded match between @entity209 and @entity210			1
barriers collapsed during the @entity213 second leg 6th round tie , leading to 33 fatalities while police horses are now associated with patrolling large public events , they were once used to protect people from thieves while transporting livestock			2
guards atop the horses often carried a sword and revolver			0
mounted police officers have been used by police in @entity59 since the early 1890s			0
the modern - day @entity227 was established in 1919 when lt col @entity229 , the @entity230 officer of the @entity231 , became assistant commissioner of the @entity233			0
a white police horse named @entity235 helped clear fans off the pitch at the @entity213 final at @entity239 in 1923 after a pitch invasion			0
the game has since been referred to as the @entity242			0
its rider , pc @entity243 received one of @entity235 's hooves , which was polished and mounted , when the horse died in 1930			0
horses usually retire between 18 and 20 years of age , where they can usually expect to retire to a long - term home			0
@entity254 was left embarrassed earlier this year when he admitted riding a police horse lent to former @entity257 editor @entity256			0
there are currently 286 horses used by police across 14 mounted units in @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 .			1

@entity50 and @entity51 forces have already got rid of 15 horses
fears that the @entity71 's other 14 units could also be under threat
@entity68 plans study to show value of horses in dealing with public order offences
