slurpee @entity0 hosted it 's annual ' @entity3 day ' at 7 - 11 stores nationwide on monday , where anyone could fill up a cup brought from home for only $ 2.60 all day			1
if you had been looking for a use for your ' @entity11 for 1996 ' trophy or a sun - bleached @entity14 pina colada cup you bought on that cruise five years ago , then this was it			0
slurpee enthusiasts came out in force , taking advantage of the generosity of the company and putting their creative talents to the test			1
one eager @entity1 fan decided a crock pot was his container of choice , filling it up with icy goodness today why not use a hollowed out rockmelon for your slurpee ? even using a bin liner in a wicker basket can work for some , as these three young slurpee fans found out the bigger the better - despite volume restrictions , these fans seem determined to make the most of @entity3 cup is a mop bucket big enough to fit all the icy goodness of @entity41 ? from trick - or - treat buckets to popcorn containers , these slurpee lovers tried it all ! will four litres of @entity1 be enough to satisfy this thirsty customer ? slurpee lovers stepped up to the @entity41 challenge and posted hundreds of pictures of themselves monday saw every receptacle imaginable used as a container for multi-coloured , multi-flavoured , and brain - freeze inducing @entity1			1
for every standard water jug , giant saucepan and old mop bucket , there wass an unexpected fish tank , hollowed out rockmelon and garbage - bin - lined wicker basket			0
for those wanting to join in the fun , there were only a few rules to keep in mind when pursuing that often elusive but now readily available @entity1 bang for your buck			0
number one , no holes			0
there 's nothing worse than the precious nectar flowing from the slurpee machine escaping out of your well - chosen vessel			2
olympian swimmer @entity77 showed her appreciation , tweeting ' @entity79 ! ' a @entity14 cuo and a water jug - perfect container for the challenge ! no more protein needed - just litres of multi-coloured icy fun ! @entity87 buckets might just do the trick for these girls a straw is n't good enough for this fan - a ladle is the only way to go ! number two , said container must not exceed 230mm by 260mm			0
this rule seems to be enforced more loosely than the first , perhaps because the novelty of seeing someone drag a kiddie pool into a convenience store far outweighs any monetary losses suffered			0
fans ranging from everyday australians to athletes such as @entity77 showed their appreciation for the iced treat , with the @entity108 swimmer tweeting a photo of herself and her slurpee with the caption ' bring your own cup day ! best day of the year ! ' the company also launched a competition encouraging customers to post their weird and wonderful slurpee vessels			1
by posting a picture of their containers , they could win their ' head as a cup ' , and well as a year 's supply of free slurpee			2
slurpee 's photo competition has seen fans posting weird and wonderful @entity3 cups to their @entity130 and @entity131 pages since the early hours of tuesday why not use an esky to keep your @entity1 cool all day ? it 's large and practical for slurping that icy treat how about a novelty skull to drink from ? cereal containers have no better use - ditch the @entity138 and fill them up with @entity1 ! even an old plastic tray might just do the trick for some @entity1 fans make sure your straw is long enough to reach that multi-coloured @entity1 concoction !			1

@entity147 ' @entity41 ' at 7 - 11 's nationwide went crazy !
