by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 18:20 est , 28 march 2013 @entity1 is at loggerheads with his captain @entity3 after claiming the @entity4 defied him by playing for his country in midweek			1
having not played for @entity6 since injuring his calf at the end of january , @entity3 surprised everybody by playing for @entity10 in their @entity12 win over @entity13 in midweek			1
despite the @entity15 telling @entity16 last night that @entity1 ’s medical staff were fully aware of @entity19 ’ intention to play @entity3 , the @entity6 boss launched a wide - ranging attack at the player and his national coach			1
defiant : @entity1 says @entity23 will not leave @entity6 this summer how they stand : city are 15 points behind @entity27 @entity1 said : ‘ i said to him , “ stay here to have more treatment but do n’t go to play because it would be taking a risk for us because these next two months are really important ”			1
he said that the manager called him and he should go			2
‘ i ca n’t put him in jail for two weeks , can i ? it is ok for him to go there and have a fitness test with their medical people but after that he should come back			2
‘ it was important that @entity42 worked here and prepared well for the last two months of the season because he has n’t played for us for 60 days			2
@entity46 's best : @entity23 ( centre ) will return to the midfield after missing the @entity50 defeat with a migraine furious : @entity1 is angry that @entity3 played for @entity10 against @entity13 return : @entity1 was disappointed that @entity10 opted to play his star centre half after injury @entity6 v @entity27 @entity55 v @entity6 @entity6 v @entity56 @entity58 v @entity6 @entity6 v @entity59 @entity60 v @entity6 reading v @entity6 @entity6 v @entity61 ‘ i hoped he would come back after one day , two days			1
i think sometimes the player has to understand that the club is more important			2
‘ i ’m not saying that international football is not important because i never say to my players , “ do n’t go to the national team ”			0
‘ but there are some cases when the club is more important			0
if he had got another injury , or if on saturday he is not ready to play because he played for the national team , and i lost him for another month , for me this is not correct by the player or the manager			1
’ last night the @entity4 @entity15 hit back at @entity1			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we ’re surprised by mr @entity1 ’s reaction as he did know @entity3 was playing the second game , as there were close contacts between our medical staff and the doctors at @entity6			1
‘ @entity3 was n’t fit to play against @entity50 two weeks ago or in our first game but our medical staff made him ready for the second game			1
we do n’t understand why they are complaining			0
they got their player back in full fitness			2
’ professionalism : @entity6 's stars will be hoping to seal second place , starting with a victory over @entity27 wrapped up : @entity94 in @entity6 's bootroom ahead of training @entity1 hopes @entity3 will be fit for tomorrow ’s @entity98 game against @entity27 at the @entity99			1
‘ i do n’t know if he is ok or not — we will see his condition today , ’ he added			0
‘ he did n’t play for us for 60 days and went to play for the @entity4 national team			0
i did not agree with it			0
managers of national teams should understand			0
these players play for their clubs , and every month the clubs pay their salary			0
‘ i tried to talk to the @entity10 manager when @entity42 was first injured			0
but probably he did n’t understand very well			0
’ in contention : @entity94 ( right ) and @entity112 are put through their paces hitting the heights : @entity116 ( right ) and @entity117 ( centre ) were back from their international duties			0

@entity122 *incensed* by @entity3 starting for his country after injury
city skipper got through full *90* minutes against @entity13
@entity1 also claims star midfielder @entity23 will not leave in the summer
