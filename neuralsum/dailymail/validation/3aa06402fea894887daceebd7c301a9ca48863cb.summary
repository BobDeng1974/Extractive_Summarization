’ instead he found his mother , @entity22 , and dr @entity9 united in their mission to save his life			2
earlier @entity22 , who speaks with her son daily , told dr @entity9 : ‘ @entity29 is at breaking point			2
he can not take too much more of not being able to see @entity31			0
' ' as we sit here right now , my son ’s life hangs in the balance			0
when @entity37 was found , he administered cpr to her and called me as he was standing in front of her saying , ‘ @entity41 , why could n’t i do it ? i could n’t get air into her lungs			0
’ during a highly emotional process @entity2 repeatedly walked out , refused to co-operate , acceded to dr @entity9 ’s request then reneged just as quickly			1
in recent days @entity2 ’s presence on social media has been increasingly erratic			1
in what was the only insight into his spiraling mind			0
on tuesday , the eve of @entity31 ’s 22nd birthday he tweeted ‘ i ’m so hurt i wan na do myself in , i know i have to strong [ sic ] ’ earlier he tweeted : ‘ you all blame me but i tried my best and it was n’t good enough sorry			0
’ earlier still he tweeted the simple plea : ‘ i love you soooooooo much plz wake up			0
’ @entity2 has been out - of control since the desperate as @entity3 's 22nd birthday approached as he tweeted ' i 'm so hurt i wan na do myself in , i know i have to strong [ sic ]			1
' @entity2 and @entity3 looked so happy together at the premier of @entity37 's last film @entity64			1
@entity3 is now in a medically induced coma and @entity2 has been banned from seeing her by the @entity3 family in an insight into his spiraling mental state , on tuesday he tweeted ' you all blame me but i tried my best and it was n't good enough sorry			1
' earlier he tweeted the simple plea to @entity3 , ' i love you soooooooo much plz wake up			2
' through it all , he has not been allowed to visit with her , as tensions between @entity2 and the @entity3 family have escalated it is five weeks since @entity3 was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the @entity81 , @entity82 , home she and @entity2 , 25 , shared			1
a helping hand : dr. @entity9 was concerned about @entity2			1
he is determined to save his life the only daughter of @entity37 and @entity86 has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother 's death in eerily similar circumstances			1
the singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near @entity96 on 11 february 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre grammy awards party			0
but unlike @entity100 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating @entity3 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21 - year - old as a criminal investigation			1
two weeks after being admitted to @entity14 's @entity105 was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection			2
instead she was given a tracheotomy			0
but any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures			0
while @entity3 fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with @entity2 , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged			1
it was @entity2 who found @entity3 and who was administering cpr when first responders arrived on the scene			1
but other than this , few details have emerged			0
there have been reports that @entity3 was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub			2
in additio to this she had been using cocaine , heroin and @entity143 in the months before the january 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to people			1
just two weeks ago @entity2 was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the @entity3 and his @entity82 home – a home owned by @entity37 until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining @entity155 footage from security cameras located at the @entity81 residence			2
lawyers for @entity2 had tried to argue that the warrant issued on february 12 was an infringement of their client 's privacy but they subsequently dropped the case			2
meanwhile the nature of @entity2 and @entity3 's union has come under intense scrutiny			1
both have referred to each other as ' husband ' and ' wife ' in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that @entity2 – who was unofficially adopted into the family by @entity37 when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ' sister			2
' in his most recent tweets @entity2 who had previously called @entity3 his ' wife ' refers to her as his ' fiancée			1
' what is clear is that , in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left @entity3 fighting for her life , her life had become increasingly chaotic			2
just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver @entity188 and drove headlong into a gray @entity189			0
the driver of the @entity191 and a passenger in her jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at @entity81 , @entity82			0
@entity2 too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months			2
police were also called to her home on january 23 after reports of a fight there			0
a security guard at the gated community where @entity3 lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ' hitting each other and swinging ' outside the three - bedroom townhouse			0
officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation			0
speaking to @entity0 a former boyfriend of @entity3 who remains a close friend , @entity216 gave an insight into the torrid pair			2
he said : ' @entity2 has a short temper and @entity3 can be difficult			2
' it was a tug of war , because they are both very stubborn people			0
@entity224 is very sweet , giving and caring , but she wants all of you , everything			0
' and @entity2 like space , that 's where a lot of the tension between them came from			2
' he revealed that @entity2 was ' getting a little wild			0
' he said : ' he was getting into car accidents			0
he 's been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years			0
he 's got a need for speed			0
he 's getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [ from @entity3 , sole inheritor of @entity37 's estate ] and crashing them life and right			2
' he had a couple of @entity246			0
he liked fast cars , bmws , that kind of thing			0
he cares , but he was n't slowing down			0
' against this backdrop , hostilities between @entity2 and @entity3 's father , @entity86 , and other family members have publicly exploded with @entity2 an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure			1
@entity2 has accused @entity3 of only being after his daughter 's money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return			1
@entity262 's aunt @entity100 is the executor @entity37 's estate estimated at between $ 12 and $ 20million trust she took out a restraining order against @entity2 in march citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in @entity3 because of her money			1
according to @entity269 the tweets , including one that read ' loam i got bigger guns than you			0
watch them react to this , ' were specifically aimed at threatening her			0
@entity269 , who was one of @entity37 's managers , has made no secret of her disapproval of @entity3 and @entity2 's ' sibling ' relationship having turned into something romantic			1
in increasingly erratic tweets @entity2 has raged against singer @entity86 accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years			1
he has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both @entity37 , who struggled with drug abuse , and @entity3 fell on his shoulders and that , now just 25 , it was too great a duty to bear .			0
