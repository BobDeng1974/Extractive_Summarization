by @entity0 a model has been struck down by a rare condition which means she faints every time she stands up			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , went from living an active life as a trainee nurse and part time model to being permanently confined to a wheelchair in a matter of hours			1
the 22 - year - old suffers from a condition known as @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , which means that every time she stands up , her heart rate speeds up , causing her to pass out			1
@entity5 's @entity15 is so severe that she has had to learn to walk on her knees around the house , and even carries a small stool with her wherever she goes			1
@entity21 : @entity5 's sudden onset of @entity15 was a mystery to doctors			1
she went from working 15 hours a day to being unable to stand for even a very short period of time doctors have been baffled by the sudden onset of @entity15 and are still at a loss as to why @entity5 suffers from it			1
@entity5 said : ' it all happened absolutely out of the blue			1
one minute i was working , rushing about and getting on with things , and the next thing i knew i 'd fainted			2
' from that moment on everything was different and i have n't been able to stand up since			2
' i have to use my wheelchair whenever i go out , and i 've learnt to get about on my knees or my bum around the house			2
' it 's all just so surreal			2
i 'd never been ill or been to hospital before this			2
i feel like i 'm living in a weird parallel universe			2
' @entity5 was working on the stroke ward at @entity47 in @entity49 hospital when she began feeling ill. @entity5 went from leading an active life as a trainee nurse and part - time model before being being struck down by a rare condition which means she faints every time she stands up ' i had a 15 hour shift ahead of me on the ward and i was just getting started			1
' i felt fine and then all of a sudden felt faint			2
i had n't had breakfast so i assumed it was that			2
' i went to the staff room to grab something to eat , and when i came back out i fainted			2
' everyone ran towards me and the next thing i knew i 'd been taken to @entity64			2
apparently i was unresponsive and people were really worried			2
' it was like a dream			0
it was all so scary , i had no idea what was happening to me			0
' after various tests , @entity5 was sent home and told to go to her gp for a check up in 24 hours time			1
she added : ' it was horrible			0
every time i stood up for even the shortest period of time i had an overwhelming feeling that i was going to faint			1
doctors are baffled and are still at a loss as to why @entity5 suffers from the condition ' i was asked to do some simple tests like pushing on the doctor 's hands and standing up for a short period of time - but as soon as i stood up i heard the doctor utter the word @entity15			1
' @entity5 then faced a long wait whilst test results were gathered and a diagnosis was made			1
she said : ' i was starting to model , going to the gym lots and training to be a nurse , and now all of a sudden i had to sit down to brush my teeth			0
i could n't even sit up in bed			0
' i used to work for 15 hours and then go on a night out - there 's no way i could do that now			0
' i 'm always the lively loud one , so for my family to see such a change in me it was really hard			0
' i got my wheelchair and then a mobility scooter , and everything was different			0
' ' i had three days of tests and they were gruelling			0
i was strapped to a tilt table and put in a standing position until i passed out			0
after being diagnosed with @entity15 , @entity5 met her boyfriend @entity108 , who she says has been supportive of her ' after the tests i was finally given a diagnosis in october last year			1
i then had to wait another six months for a follow - up appointment , where i 've been put on a course of medication to try and deal with the @entity15			1
' it 's a waiting game at the moment to see if any medication will work but i always try to look on the bright side and hope for the best			0
' @entity15 ( @entity15 ) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition			1
simply standing up can be a challenge for people with @entity15 as their body is unable to adjust to gravity			1
@entity15 is characterised by what 's known as orthostatic intolerance - the development of symptoms when upright that are relieved by lying down			1
symptoms include headaches , fatigue , palpitations , sweating , nausea , fainting and dizziness			0
they are associated with an increase in heart rate from the lying to upright position of greater than 30 beats per minute , or a heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing			1
for more information : http://www.potsuk.org / but despite the condition , @entity5 maintains a positive outlook , and has even started a @entity148 channel where she hopes to raise awareness of @entity15 and her journey with it			1
' it was tricky at first but i still try and live as normal life as possible , ' she says			0
' i really missed getting to go out and go dancing with my friends , but luckily my friend 's husband is a bouncer at a nightclub			0
' he was able to carry me into the club , and get me sat down - i stayed on the same chair all night but it was amazing			0
' i even met my boyfriend , @entity108 that night			0
we started chatting and it was great because you 'd never have guessed that i had anything wrong with me			0
' @entity108 's been so supportive about my condition			0
going on a first date in a wheel chair was pretty daunting , but it did n't seem to phase him			0
' we 've never walked hand in hand , which is something most couples take for granted , but we have a great relationship all the same			0
' in an ideal world i 'd wake up one morning and be fine again			0
i hope that it will go away as quickly as it started			0
' but in the mean time i 'll try my best to live as normally as i can			1
' i want other @entity15 sufferers to know that they 're not alone			1
