by @entity0 published : 04:31 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 02:30 est , 31 january 2013 the founder of @entity2 has said the batteries used by @entity4 in its @entity6 aircraft are ' inherently unsafe ' - after it emerged that an airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded			1
@entity4 was placed under increasing pressure today after it emerged the plane manufacturer knew of previous problems with the batteries			1
all @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems			1
concerns : all @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said today it had replaced batteries on its 787 aircraft 10 times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems , and informed @entity4 about the swaps damaged : the singed battery case from the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) @entity6 is displayed inside an investigation lab at the @entity29 in @entity30 investigation : the state - of - the - art @entity33 continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues and @entity26 also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 ' on a few occasions '			1
@entity16 said it had informed @entity4 about the swaps			1
however , it said it was not required to report the battery problems to safety regulators because they were not considered a safety issue and none of its flights were delayed or cancelled			2
the incidents occurred between may and december last year			0
adding to the pressure on @entity4 , @entity49 innovator and entrepreneur @entity47 , who is the founder of @entity2 car company , told @entity55 aerospace journal @entity53 about the batteries : ' unfortunately , the pack architecture supplied to @entity4 is inherently unsafe			1
' all 50 of the @entity58 in use around the world were grounded following two incidents with the batteries earlier this month			2
first , there was also a battery fire in a 787 parked at @entity66 's @entity65 on january 7			2
then on january 16 , an @entity16 flight was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity69 when its main battery overheated			1
burnt : the @entity29 's @entity72 , holds part of the badly fire - damaged battery casing			0
the battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong according to the @entity79 , @entity16 said in five of the ten replacement batteries the main battery had showed a low charge			1
in three cases , the airline said the main battery failed to operate normally			2
@entity26 spokesman @entity86 declined to be more specific on when units were replaced or whether these were reported to authorities			1
following the revelations about the previous problems with the batteries , @entity4 was today ordered to provide a full operating history of the batteries used in its 787 @entity33			1
the @entity95 in the @entity49 made the request after becoming aware of the previous incidents			0
lithium - ion batteries are prone to overheating and require additional safeguards to prevent fires			2
@entity102 , a spokeswoman for the @entity103 , said in @entity30 that the agency was checking whether the previous battery incidents had been reported by @entity4			2
with 17 of the jets , @entity16 was @entity4 's launch customer for the technologically advanced airliner			1
the airline has had to cancel hundreds of flights , affecting tens of thousands of people , but has sought to minimise disruptions by switching to other aircraft as much as possible			2
probe : @entity29 investigators and metallurgists examine parts of the disassembled battery which have been laid out on a table detailed : a member of the @entity29 investigation team examines pieces of damaged electrode coils from the battery the battery problems experienced by @entity16 before the emergency landing were first reported by @entity79			1
@entity69 and @entity49 investigators looking into the @entity6 's battery problems shifted their attention this week from the battery - maker , @entity130 of @entity131 , @entity69 , to the manufacturer of a monitoring system			0
that company , @entity134 , makes a system that monitors voltage , charging and temperature of the lithium - ion batteries			0
yesterday the @entity95 said it was conducting a chemical analysis of internal short circuiting and thermal damage of the battery that caught fire in @entity66			0
the probe was also analysing data from flight data recorders on the aircraft , the @entity29 said on its website			0
incident : a 787 made a landing in @entity151 after a burning smell was also detected in its cockpit			0
both all @entity154 and @entity26 have grounded their entire @entity6 fleets hopes : visitors admired the first production model of the @entity6 when it was unveiled to an audience of several thousand at @entity4 's assembly plant in @entity161 , @entity30 complex : parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world last week experts from the @entity95 ( @entity29 ) began disassembled the burnt out battery from the @entity6 which caught fire in a bid to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted they are no closer to reaching a conclusion			1
they believe it could hold the key to the technical problem which grounded the entire multi-billion dollar fleet			0
the @entity29 said its investigation into the incident on january 7 is still in its ' early stages			0
' @entity181 , head of the @entity29 , described the incident in @entity66 as a ' very serious air safety concern ' , and that the body does ' not expect to see fire events onboard aircraft , ' according to the @entity187			0
meanwhile , batteries expert @entity188 , who worked for @entity190 for 40 years told @entity192 news that from what he knows about the incidents on board the @entity4 787s he would ' not fly in a @entity6 tomorrow			1
' ' i just would n't feel that it was appropriate or safe , ' he said			0
the @entity29 said that despite establishing that the lithium - ion device suffered a short circuit it still has to ' figure out why these events occurred			0
' the revelation is more bad news for @entity4 as it means the worldwide fleet of @entity33 remains grounded			1
@entity4 said lithium ion batteries ' best met the performance and design objectives of the 787 ' and that ' based on everything we know at this point , we have not changed our evaluation , ' @entity192 news reports			1
the @entity6 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries			0
they charge faster and can be better moulded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			2
the battery fire is just one of a series of problems - including two fuel leaks , a wiring problem , brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window â€“ to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late			2
@entity228 , chief engineer on the 787 , said earlier this month that the plane 's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault			2
he said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures ' do n't put the airplane at risk '			0
in a statement today , @entity4 said : ' batteries are a replaceable unit on airplanes , regardless of the technology used			1
every day there are on the order of five or six batteries on @entity4 airplanes that are removed and replaced - about 2,000 per year			1
we have an ongoing process to look for opportunities to extend the service life of replaceable units like batteries across our fleet			0
' we have not seen 787 battery replacements occurring as a result of safety concerns			0
the batteries are being returned because our robust protection scheme ensures that no battery that has been deeply discharged or improperly disconnected can be used			0
the third highest category for battery returns is exceeding the battery shelf life - this is a fact of life in dealing with batteries ; they sometimes expire and must be returned			0

all @entity16 said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems
and @entity26 also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 ' on a few occasions '
@entity4 was today ordered to provide a full operating history of the batteries used in its 787 @entity33 following the revelations
