by @entity1 reporter published : 13:28 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 01:30 est , 9 september 2013 grown tired of climbing a 30 - foot ladder to his treehouse , @entity2 decided he needed to invent something that could take him up in a fraction of the time			1
the inventive 22 - year - old from @entity9 , @entity10 , quickly hit upon about the idea of developing a bicycle - powered ‘ elevator ’ which now allows him to pedal himself up in 30 seconds flat			1
once @entity2 had hit upon the ingenious idea , it took him a couple of attempts to get his unusual elevator just right			1
‘ as soon as we came up with the idea , i knew i had to make it a reality , ’ @entity2 told @entity32			1
‘ it would be so incredibly fun and whimsical			0
’ after developing the basic idea in his head , @entity2 set about modifying his bicycle by welding pieces of scrap metal to the frame so he could attach points and pulleys			2
‘ after the first trial run , it became clear that the gear ratio was not nearly low enough , as i could not even pedal it up the tree at all			0
’ much easier than taking the stairs : in no time at all @entity21 has arrived at his treehouse going down : @entity21 's weight and gravity mean it is even easier going down than going up ‘ first , i changed the gear ratio on the bicycle by swapping a large front sprocket to the rear , which was still not quite easy enough to pedal , so i added a pulley into the system to gain a bit more [ mechanical ] advantage , ' he said			0
' once i had the counterweight adjusted , it worked better than i could have hoped			0
' to counterweight the bicycle , @entity2 has used an old water heater tank which can be adjusted by simply adding or removing water			2
the process of constructing the bicycle elevator took less than a week			0
@entity2 is still finishing construction on his tree house that he can now more easily access via his bicycle			2
he plans to install walls and insulation in the next few weeks , with the ultimate goal of sleeping and , perhaps eventually , living full - time in his 30 - foot high outdoor home			0
@entity2 's ingenious device uses an old water heater tank as a counterweight the bike has to be chained to a large stone when it is n't in use or else gravity would cause it to go straight up again			1

@entity2 , 22 , has design an ingenious way to get to his treehouse quickly
