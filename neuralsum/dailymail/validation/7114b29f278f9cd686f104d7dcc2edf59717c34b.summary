everyone from @entity1 and @entity2 to @entity3 and @entity4 have chopped off their long locks recently , making shorter hair a bona fide trend			1
but the rise in these shorter haircuts is n't just down to their flattering face - framing effects			2
according to the @entity15 , the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is also sign of economic recovery , since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are therefore more pricey to maintain			1
shorter haircuts , like @entity4 's new bob ( right ) , are an indication that the economy is in recovery @entity3 wore a longer style in @entity27 ( left ) but recently she went for the chop ( right , in february ) celebrity hairdresser @entity29 , whose clients have included @entity31 and @entity32 , told the newspaper that he believes shorter hairdos are a sure sign that the economy is bouncing back			1
he said : ' products are flying off the shelf , more than they used to even a few months ago			0
' and it 's not just the fact that shorter styles require more sprays and gels			1
the upkeep of a lob ( long bob ) or pixie crop is also time - consuming , with some women having to visit the salon every four to six weeks to maintain the look			1
@entity2 went from one dramatic hairstyle ( left , in march 2014 ) to another ( right , in february 2015 ) @entity52 ( left , in july 2014 ) made waves when she got her chin - length lob ( right , in february 2015 ) @entity55 transformed her long auburn locks ( left , in may 2014 ) to an equally daring short style ( right , in february 2015 ) by contrast , women with longer hair can leave it a few months before going in to top up their trims			1
' with short hair you need to keep it in shape , ' explained mr @entity29			0
' with long hair , a lot of women tend to leave it months on end			0
' @entity4 , who is the face of @entity72 , debuted her new layered bob just last week on the @entity74			0
and @entity75 actress @entity2 chose the @entity76 to show off her new shorter blonde look			1
a-list trends may not be the best indication of a pattern in the real world , but according to hairdresser @entity83 , who owns @entity84 in @entity87 's @entity86 neighbourhood , non-famous women are also following suit			2
@entity89 traded in her hippie - chic long waves ( left , in march 2014 ) for a side - swept lob ( right , in january ) @entity92 had longer locks in march 2014 ( left )			2
but now , she has a very edgy pixie cut ( right , february ) ' girls are going shorter , ' he told the @entity97 , adding that his salon charges about Â£ 48 for a bob , with women tending to come in every six weeks to maintain the style			2
but mr @entity83 feels that the trend is more a sign of modernity than of economic change , since women visit salons even during a recession because they see it as a way of treating themselves			0
in any case , he says he 's definitely a fan of the new it - style			0
he said : ' it used to be that girls had long hair and men had short			0
' finally it 's 2015 and things have shifted - and i think that 's very exciting			0
' it 's not just hair that gets shorter during a recovery - rising hemlines are also an indication that the economy is on the up			1
and judging by this year 's @entity130 shows , where labels including @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 showcased leg - baring @entity136 minis , it 's a trend that is here to stay .			0

shorter cuts require more frequent upkeep at the salon , which costs money
@entity1 , @entity2 and @entity89 have all gone for chop
rising hemlines on skirts are also indication that economy is on the up
