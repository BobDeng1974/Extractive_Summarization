that was back on july 19 , 1989 , when may was a passenger aboard @entity13			1
the @entity14 was traveling from @entity15 to @entity16 when it lost all hydraulic power after the rear engine exploded			1
the crew used the remaining two engines to steer a winding course to @entity22 , where the massive plane crash - landed , cartwheeling down the runway and bursting into flames before breaking apart in a cornfield			1

at the time , capt. @entity43 was hailed in much the same way as @entity71 pilot @entity70 , who safely ditched his @entity72 into the @entity73 in @entity74 in 2009			0
the legacy of the crash lives on			0
it changed the way planes were designed , ensuring more backup systems to prevent the kind of catastrophic hydraulic failure that made @entity13 almost impossible to control			1
it also drew attention to the need for emergency preparedness			0
and the efforts of the crew were remembered in movies and books			2
this weekend , survivors will gather for 25th anniversary memorial events at the @entity93 in @entity22			1
still , some of the safety changes sought by survivors have not happened			2
@entity41 , the lead flight attendant on @entity13 , has led an unsuccessful campaign to get the @entity50 to end the practice of allowing children under the age of 2 to travel on a parent 's lap without a ticketed seat			1
she is haunted by the memory of a 22 - month - old lap child who died in the crash			1
' it 's heart - wrenching after 25 years , ' said @entity41 , now 73			2
' how truly pathetic that you can still take a lap child , the most vulnerable of our population , and risk flying with them on our lap. ' before she left her role as chair of the @entity119 earlier this year , @entity116 lamented that the rules for lap children had not been changed since the crash			2
in a statement , an @entity50 spokeswoman said the agency recommends that parents secure infants in seats , but said that if they are forced to buy an extra ticket , parents may eschew flying for driving , which could be more dangerous			0
according to data on the @entity134 @entity136 website , there have been no preventable infant deaths on planes in 17 years			0
the terror on @entity13 unfolded over more than 40 minutes			1
at about 3:15 p.m. , an engine on the @entity14 aircraft exploded and chunks of metal ripped apart all three of the jet 's hydraulic systems			1
the plane lost all hydraulic fluid , shutting down the systems that controlled the plane 's altitude and direction			1

he was aided by instructional pilot @entity168 , who just happened to be traveling on the flight as a passenger			1
@entity171 sat on the floor of the cockpit			0
the crew knew the plane was in grave danger			0
' the potential was that we could all go straight down , ' @entity41 said			0
according to the recordings from the cockpit , he said to the crew : ' we 're not gon na make the runway , fellas			0
we 're gon na have to ditch this son of a ( expletive ) and hope for the best			0
' as the pilots tried to bring the plane down at the @entity22 airport , the right wing plowed into the ground , sending the jet into a cartwheel and tearing it apart as it skidded across the pavement into a cornfield			1
' it was complete chaos			0
bodies thrown about the plane			0
others were thrown from their chairs			0
there was smoke and fire and debris , ' said @entity207 , 54 , of @entity208 , @entity209			0

@entity207 tried to help people out and then went back in for a baby he heard crying			2
the crash , captured on video and viewed in news broadcasts , was the subject of extensive review			0
an analysis by the @entity119 found that the airline failed to detect a crack in a fan disk in one of the engines during an inspection process , which ultimately led to the engine failure			2
soon after , @entity14 planes were modified with a shut - off valve to prevent the loss of all hydraulic fluid in future			1
the emergency response in @entity22 was also as a model for other cities to match			2
county authorities had disaster plans in place and had drilled for such situations			0
they quickly mobilized huge numbers of medical and rescue personnel , bringing in ambulances from more than 28 agencies across a 60 - mile radius			2
for survivors , the legacy of the crash is complicated , given the many lives lost			2
@entity207 said he will attend the memorial services this weekend , but then hopes to finally put @entity13 behind him			1
' i think as much as anything , it will be good for my family			0
our son , who is 15 , is going to come along , ' he said			0
