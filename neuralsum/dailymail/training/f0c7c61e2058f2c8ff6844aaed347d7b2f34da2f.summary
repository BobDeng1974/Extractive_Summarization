by @entity0 published : 21:28 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 21:28 est , 31 october 2013 a federal appeals court on thursday blocked a judge 's ruling that found the @entity5 's stop - and - frisk policy discriminated against minorities , and it took the unusual step of removing her from the case , saying interviews she gave during the trial called her impartiality into question			1
the city applauded the appeals court 's decision			2
police commissioner @entity19 , who was shouted down over the tactic by students during a speech at @entity23 this week , said he was grateful for it			0
' this is indeed an important decision for all @entity26 and for the men and women of the @entity5 who work very hard day in and day out to keep this city safe , ' he said			2
@entity30 stops : the @entity5 's stop - and - frisk policy was deemed discriminatory against minorities by judge @entity33 the 2nd @entity35 @entity34 said the ruling by @entity35 district judge @entity33 will be on hold pending the outcome of an appeal by the city			1
but it may be a non-issue after next week 's mayoral election : democrat @entity44 , who 's leading in polls , has said he would drop objections to the ruling , which calls for major changes to the police tactic			1
the judge decided in august the city violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of blacks and @entity54 by disproportionally stopping , questioning and sometimes frisking them			0
she assigned a monitor to help the police department change its policy and training programs on the tactic			0
the three - judge panel heard arguments tuesday			0
lawyers in the case said the police department has n't had to do anything except meet with a monitor since the judge 's decision , but the city said police officers are afraid to stop and frisk people now and the number of stop - and - frisks has dropped dramatically			1
judgement blocked : a @entity26 federal appeals court blocked @entity33 's order requiring changes to @entity26 's stop - and - frisk program and removed her from the case the appeals panel did n't change the deadline for the appeal and said it expected arguments in march , well after the new mayor takes office			1
it said @entity33 needed to be removed because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for @entity35 judges by misapplying a ruling that allowed her to take the case and by giving media interviews and making public statements responding to criticism			1
@entity33 said in a statement later thursday she consented to the interviews under the condition she would n't comment on the ongoing case			1
' and i did not , ' she said			0
shouted down : police commissioner @entity19 says he is pleased with the decision to block @entity33 's finding she said some reporters used quotes from written opinions that gave the appearance she had commented on the case but ' a careful reading of each interview will reveal that no such comments were made			2
' she also defended her decision to direct the plaintiffs to bring the case to her , saying she took the most recent case because it was related to a previous case she heard			0
the @entity116 said a new judge would be assigned randomly and will deal with any further rulings			0
it 's possible the new judge could order a fresh set of reforms or review the trial testimony and decide the city did n't violate people 's civil rights , but it would be highly unusual.stop - and - frisk has been around for decades , but recorded stops increased dramatically under mayor @entity130 's administration to an all - time high in 2011 of 684,330 , mostly of black and @entity132 men			1
future plans : mayoral frontrunner @entity44 will drop any objections to the ruling if he is elected @entity26 mayor a lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four minority men , who said they were targeted because of their races , and it became a class - action case			1
to make a stop , police must have reasonable suspicion that a crime is about to occur or has occurred , a standard lower than the probable cause needed to justify an arrest			0
only about 10 per cent of the stops result in arrests or summonses , and weapons are found about two per cent of the time			0
@entity33 heard a bench trial that ended in the spring and coincided with a groundswell of backlash against the stop - and - frisk tactic , which became a mayoral race flashpoint			1
she noted in her ruling this summer that she was n't putting an end to the practice , which is constitutional , but was reforming the way the @entity5 implemented its stops			2
public debate : two men reenact the controversial ' stop - and - frisk ' pose on a @entity168 street while in costume on @entity170 day on october 31 , 2013 in @entity26 the @entity171 , which represented the four men who sued , said it was dismayed that the appeals court delayed ' the long - overdue process to remedy the @entity5 's unconstitutional stop - and - frisk practices ' and was shocked that it ' cast aspersions ' on the judge 's professional conduct and reassigned the case			1
@entity181 , the city 's public advocate , said he was ' extremely disappointed ' in thursday 's decision			0
' we have to end the overuse of stop and frisk - and any delay only means a continued and unnecessary rift between our police and the people they protect , ' he said in a statement			2
his @entity194 challenger , @entity193 , a deputy under former mayor @entity195 , praised it			0
' the next mayor absolutely must continue this appeal , ' he said .			0

a federal appeals court blocked a judge 's ruling that found the @entity5 's stop - and - frisk policy discriminates against minorities
the appeals court removed judge @entity33 from the case saying that she *'d* given interviews that called her impartiality into question
