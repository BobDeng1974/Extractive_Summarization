sympathetic : @entity3 went above and beyond last month , when it delayed a flight to @entity5 , @entity6 , so a passenger could get home in time to say goodbye to his dying mother ( stock photo ) ' i knew this itinerary was a risk because the stopover in @entity21 was only about 40 minutes , and my connecting flight was the last flight to @entity5 that day , ' @entity10 told consumer advocate @entity33			1
' but i needed to get there as soon as possible , so i took the risk			0
' as fate would have it , his first leg , @entity3 flight 667 , was delayed half an hour taking off			2
the news left the loving son visibly distraught , as he faced the very real possibility that he 'd get to @entity5 too late to see his mother before she died			1
noticing @entity10 in tears , flight attendant @entity45 tried to comfort him , bringing him extra napkins in lieu of tissues and vowing to do whatever they could to help him out			2
another flight attendant , @entity52 , asked @entity10 what his flight number from @entity21 to @entity5 was and relayed it to the captain who himself was trying to make up time in the air on @entity10 's behalf			1
but the aircraft touched down after @entity10 's second leg was due to have left the gate , and the man thought all hope was lost			2
' as i was running up to the gate , the gate agent saw me coming and shouted , " mr. @entity10 ? we 've been expecting you " , ' he said			2
' that 's when i knew they had conspired to help me			0
she waved me onto the plane without looking at my boarding pass			0
' delayed : @entity74 delayed the plane for @entity10 and not only did the emotional son make it to @entity5 as scheduled , but so did his bags ( stock photo ) @entity3 had delayed the plane by around 15 to 20 minutes for him and not only did the emotional son make it to @entity5 as scheduled , but so did his bags			1
and it was just as well he got that flight			0
' had i missed my flight to @entity5 , i would not have been able to tell my mom goodbye , ' @entity10 told @entity86 's blog			1

but after a final rally at around 4 a.m. @entity13 passed away on the morning of january 25			0
' when she died , i realized i was wiping away my tears with the extra @entity3 napkins that @entity98 had given me the day before , ' he said			0
