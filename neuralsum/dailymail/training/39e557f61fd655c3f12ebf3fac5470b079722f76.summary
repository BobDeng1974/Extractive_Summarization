by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 23 october 2012 @entity2 's ruling @entity1 could be heading for reform after subtly dropping references to the county 's late leader @entity5 from two policy statements			1
@entity5 has always been held up as an ideological great in party communiques , his name mentioned almost by default in homage to his role in founding modern @entity2 and leading the @entity1 , whose rule from the 1949 revolution remains unbroken			1
which is why the dropping of the words ' @entity5 thought ' from two recent statements by the party 's elite @entity22 ahead of a landmark congress , at which a new generation of leaders will take the top party posts , has attracted so much attention			1
also absent were normally standard references to @entity30			0
changing times : a guard posted at the @entity33 of the @entity34 in @entity35 stands in front of a portrait of @entity5 , and a placard to the glory of @entity2			1
but some think the country could be heading for reform after subtly dropping references to @entity5 from two policy statements the omission in the latest statement by the powerful decision - making body on monday , revealing that the congress next month would discuss amending the party 's constitution , has been seen by some as sending a signal about its intent on reform			1
one of the constitution 's key platforms is @entity5 thought			1
' it 's very significant , ' @entity57 , the director of the @entity58 at the @entity59 , said of the removal of a reference to @entity63 and the implications of that for the direction leaders were taking			0
the wording has in the past talked about ' holding high the banner of @entity5 thought and @entity30 ' in carrying out the party 's work , and is often included at the end of statements almost as a mantra			1
but the latest two statements mentioned only that the party should follow ' @entity78 theory ' , the ' three represents ' and the ' scientific development concept '			0
late paramount leader @entity78 introduced the idea that @entity2 can be both communist and have market - based reforms , while the ' three represents ' refers to former president @entity84 's policy which formally allowed capitalists to join the party			2
the last idea is current president @entity89 's thinking of promoting more rounded economic development			0
leader : president @entity89 is in favour of allowing capitalists to join the @entity1 , to promote more rounded economic development @entity63 adapted the original theories of @entity30 that grew out of industrial @entity96 to the conditions of largely rural @entity2 when @entity5 took over in 1949			1
' before the fall of @entity100 , that direction was not so clear			0
but now it 's become quite clear			0
i mean , less @entity63 , but more @entity103 , ' mr @entity57 said			0
@entity100 , a former high - flying politician supported by leftists , was ousted this year in @entity2 's biggest political scandal in two decades			2
by removing @entity63 , the top leaders were signalling a push for reforms , mr @entity57 said , in the same way @entity78 introduced landmark market reforms in the late 1970s that turned @entity2 from a backwater into an economic powerhouse			2
there was also no reference made to @entity5 thought in a previous announcement on the date of the party congress			1
doctrinal differences between reformist and leftist factions reflect an internal debate about the direction of the new leadership whose taking up of the reins of power starts at the congress opening in @entity35 on november 8			0
the debate has been under the spotlight since the rise and subsequent fall of @entity100 , who , as party boss of the southwestern city of @entity133 , drew support from leftists critical of aspects of the market - based reform agenda			0
@entity2 heads into the congress with the economy heading for its slowest annual growth rate in at least 13 years , while social stresses , such as anger over corruption , land grabs and unmet welfare demands , stir protests			2
state media , as well as experts close to the government , have made increasingly strident calls for bold reform to avoid a crisis , though nobody seriously expects a move towards full democracy			0
despite his ruthless political campaigns in which tens of millions died , @entity5 , whose portrait looms large on @entity157 , has always been largely revered as a charismatic ruler who stood up to foreigners and unified the country			0
@entity5 's legacy in @entity2 remains tightly guarded by a @entity1 leadership bent on preserving his memory to shore up their own legitimacy , which , unlike his , was not forged in war			1
in 2003 , on the 110th anniversary of @entity5 's birth , @entity89 declared that ' the banner of @entity63 will always be held high , at all times and in all circumstances ' .			2

@entity5 has long been held up as an ideological great
name is *synonymous* with founding modern @entity2 , leading @entity1
dropping the words ' @entity5 thought ' from two statements by party 's elite @entity22 ahead of a landmark congress has attracted much attention
