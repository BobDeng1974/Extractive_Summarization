an 800lb woman , whose weight spiraled out of control after she was kidnapped by an ex-boyfriend and held hostage , finally stood up for the first time after years of being bound to her bed and taken care of by her three daughters			1
when viewers first met @entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , on last night 's season finale of my 600lb life , doctors determined that she was only months - maybe even weeks - from dying			1
and even after a lengthy hospital stay and gastric bypass surgery , the 43 - year - old still refused to let medical professionals help her stand up – and , in doing so , save her life			1
@entity11 's recovery seemed like a hopeless cause until it dawned on the mother - of - three that this was her last shot			1
if she did n't get up , she would spend the rest of her very short life bedridden			0
the surgeon had all but given up on @entity11 until he received an impassioned call from @entity38 , begging him to come to her apartment and convince her mom to get up once and for all			0
dr @entity41 made the house call and requested emergency medical technicians come to the apartment to help @entity11 stand for the first time in years			1
with the help of a walker , the @entity58 and dr @entity41 's support , @entity11 was able to stand for a few seconds			1
and , although brief , this short moment gave her enough confidence to try and stand again , essentially changing the direction of her recovery for the better			0
stuck : the mother - of - three relied on her daughters to take care of her			2
she can be seen rolling over , so her daughter @entity70 could bathe her while she laid in bed last stand : @entity70 tearfully explained she feared her mother would die if she did n't get help before she moved to @entity39 , @entity11 depended on her three daughters , @entity76 , @entity70 and @entity38 , for everything			1
' i have no life , ' she told the cameras			0
' my legs ca n't even hold my weight anymore			0
' her children had no choice but to clean her and take care of her			0
‘ i 'm 24 and i have to take care of my mom			0
i wipe her , bathe her , make sure she 's clean			0
and i do get tired , ' @entity70 explained with frustration			0
@entity11 noted that ' it 's embarrassing ' , but added she has no other choice because of her mother ’s massive size			2
because of her morbid obesity , @entity11 suffered from arthritis , gout , swelling in her joints and diabetes , in addition to being bed ridden and in constant pain			2
junk food addict : @entity11 can be seen looking at the junk food @entity70 had brought for her to eat making dinner : @entity11 , who was unable to get out of bed , had a table brought to her so she could fry some chicken she explained that she never had problems with her weight when she was a child , but her eating got out of control after she tried to break up with her boyfriend who ' lost it ' and proceeded to kidnap her , hold her at gunpoint and even shot two officers who tried to rescue her before she escaped			2
after the ordeal , @entity11 refused to leave her house because she was living in constant fear that he would find her and kill her			2
she soon turned to food for comfort , and by the time her ex-boyfriend was caught , it was too late			0
' the kidnapping changed my life forever , and i wish i could take that day back , ' she said			0
but allowing herself to indulge in endless bad eating habits for years , @entity11 admitted that she was terrified that her daughters were going to find her dead in bed one day , so she made the decision to travel to @entity39 to seek dr @entity41 ’s help			1
bad choices : she can be see frying the chicken in boiling vegetable oil at her bedside extra calories : after making her meal , @entity11 covered her fried chicken tenders in @entity143 dressing before eating them emotional eating : @entity11 explained that she turned to food for comfort after her ex-boyfriend kidnapped her and held her hostage when she was in her early 20s because she was unable to get out of bed , she had to call an ambulance to transport her to her daughter 's car where she sat for the entire 13 hour drive			1
and the trip almost killed her			0
a blood clot that had formed in her leg after years of not moving dislodged during the trip and traveled to her lung			2
by the time she got to the hospital in @entity39 , her health was rapidly declining			2
' she is in the worst condition health wise that i have ever seen , ' dr @entity41 said , noting that she should have never traveled to @entity39 at her size			1
in pain : @entity11 was filled with pain after a blood clot dislodged in her leg and traveled to her lung during her trip to @entity39 , @entity40 to see dr @entity41 heavy lifting : a group of hospital members worked together to life @entity11 into bed ' i am not [ as ] worried about weight loss surgery as [ i am about ] making sure she will survive the next 24 hours , ' he said			1
' this is [ a ] very dangerous situation			0
she is at the end of her life if we ca n't do anything			0
' after dr @entity41 put a filter in her leg to prevent any more blood clots from forming , @entity11 recovered and was put on a 1,000 - calories - per - day diet while she was living in the hospital			1
in an attempt to make painfully clear to @entity11 the extent of her condition , the doctor explained that when she was living in @entity12 she was ' months or even weeks from death '			1
but despite the danger of developing another blood clot , @entity11 refused to try and stand or move her legs			1
@entity38 , who gave up her life to move with her mom to @entity39 , scolded her for sending her physical therapists away , but @entity11 maintained that everyone was pushing her too hard			2
preventative measures : dr @entity41 can be seen putting a filter in @entity11 's leg to prevent more blood clots from forming and traveling to her lungs second chance : as a last resort , he would later perform gastric bypass surgery on @entity11 in the hope of saving her life ' you need to work on your attitude , ' @entity38 told her with frustration			1
dr @entity41 explained that ' @entity11 has convinced herself that she can not walk , but the reality is that she does n't want to walk '			1
when @entity11 was pressured to try and stand , she started screaming in pain and begged to be pushed back on the bed			2
‘ if @entity11 wo n't get up , we ca n't treat her , ' dr @entity41 said			1
' this is a life or death situation			0
she is going to die			0
' despite her massive size , dr @entity41 opted to perform weight loss surgery a few months later because there was no other way to help her			1
new foods : @entity11 can be seen eating healthier options while she maintained a 1,000 - calories - per - day diet during her hospital stay doctors orders : @entity11 's daughter @entity38 grew frustrated with her because she refused to try and get up not confident : @entity11 continued to make excuses for why she was unable to attempt to get out of bed following the gastric bypass , @entity11 was once again at risk of developing blood clots , but she continued to rely on a physical therapist to move her legs for her			1
a frustrated dr @entity41 yelled at her for giving the hospital staff and her daughter ' attitude ' when they were trying to help her			1
without her cooperation , he had no choice but to discharge her from the hospital			0
because she was still unable to fend for herself , @entity11 decided to move in with @entity38 in @entity39 , but insisted that she did n’t need the help of her doctors in order to get better			2
' i can make healthy choices on my own , ' she said			0
' i can do this better			0
' but @entity11 still was n’t making any progress , especially when it came to working her muscles			0
' you 've been sitting here for eight weeks ! ' @entity38 yelled at her mom before making a desperate call to dr @entity41			1
major victory : @entity11 can be seen standing on the scale for the first time in five years all smiles : @entity11 was happy to learn that lost an estimated 266lbs since she started her journey a year ago it was his visit and support that changed @entity11 's life			2
