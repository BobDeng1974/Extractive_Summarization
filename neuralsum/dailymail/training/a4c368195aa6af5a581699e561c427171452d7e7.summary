colours have the ability to stir emotions - from red for anger , and blue for sadness - yet one artist has taken this a step further by converting these colours into music			1
@entity11 was born with achromatopsia , the most extreme form of colour - blindness , which leaves him only able to see in black and white			2
he created an electronic ‘ eye ’ that lets him ‘ hear ’ colours as different musical frequencies - and has now used this system to conduct the world ’s first ' colour choir '			1
he used these tones to compose a piece of music which was recently performed by the world 's first colour - conducted choir , pictured , in @entity33 @entity11 , pictured , developed the ' antenna ' to interpret the world around him			1
it receives light waves and converts them into sound frequencies @entity11 developed the so - called ‘ antenna ’ to interpret the world around him			1
it receives light waves and converts them into different sound frequencies , and high or low - pitched tones			0
@entity11 can then hear these tones , through the antenna , using bone conduction			1
as part of @entity48 ’s @entity47 , @entity11 used this system to teach an orchestra in @entity24 to recognise which colours go with which frequencies			2
they then performed a piece of music based on his teaching			2
the composition was created using colours taken from an image of the @entity60 in @entity33			0
it was performed by 42 members of the @entity60 ’s @entity63 and the @entity64			0
to create the music , @entity11 recorded the spectrum of colours taken from an image of the @entity60 using an antenna fixed to his forehead , pictured			1
these tones were ordered to create a musical score @entity11 , pictured front , taught musicians and singers which colours matched with which frequencies , using cards held in front of his ' electric eye '			1
the sounds were played on a loud speaker to create the music , @entity11 recorded the colours taken from an image of the @entity60 using an antenna fixed to his forehead			1
these tones were ordered to create a musical score			0
@entity11 taught the musicians which colours matched with which frequencies , using his @entity94 app. when the phone 's camera is held over a colour , the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels from the centre of an image			2
each member played , or sung , notes based only on the colours they saw on the tablet devices in front of them and the tablets were controlled by @entity11			1
each member played , or sung , notes based only on the colours they saw on tablet screens in front of them , and the tablets were controlled by @entity11			1
to create the music , @entity11 held a photo of the glass ceiling from the @entity60 in front of his antenna			0
he recorded the sounds and built a score using these tones			0
@entity11 taught the musicians which colours matched with which frequencies , using colour cards and his own @entity94 app. when the phone 's camera is held over a colour , the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels from the centre of an image			2
‘ to see other people performing colours for the first time was a thrilling feeling for me , ’ explained @entity11			0
‘ for so long now i ’ve been living in my own world , the only one hearing			0
' he also used his @entity94 app , pictured , to give the musicians an insight into how he sees the world			0
when the phone 's camera is held over a colour , the app plays the relevant frequency by capturing pixels from the centre of an image			0
the app is free to download from the @entity151 store all the colours in the composition were taken from those seen in the glass ceiling at the @entity60 , pictured rear			0
each member of the orchestra played , or sung , notes based only on the colours they saw on tablets in front of them			1
these tablets were controlled by @entity11 , pictured front			0

@entity24 artist and musician @entity11 uses music to ‘ hear ’ colour
an ' electric eye ' worn on his forehead turns colours to musical frequencies
@entity11 hears these different frequencies via bone conduction
he has composed music based on the colours of the @entity60
in a world 's first , a colour - conducted choir has performed his score
each member played notes based only on colours they saw on a screen
