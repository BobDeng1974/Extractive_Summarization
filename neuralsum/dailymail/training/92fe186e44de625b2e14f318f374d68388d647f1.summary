they are ranked no 1 and in the world and the last two winners of the @entity3			0
now @entity4 and @entity5 are set to give the finest season in the history of @entity9 golf a fitting send - off with a heavyweight clash over the weekend			1
day two honours at this year ’s edition of the tour ’s final event went to defending champion @entity4 , who shot a 66 to lead by two shots from @entity5 , who carded a 70 , with scot @entity17 ( 69 ) and in - form @entity19 ( 67 ) from @entity20 on the same mark			1
‘ @entity4 is very comfortable around this course , and i certainly can not afford to let him get any further ahead , ’ said @entity5			1
@entity5 struggled to replicate his first round form but still shot a two - under par round of 70 @entity4 shot a six - under par round of 66 to seize the lead by two shots after round two as for his own round , the @entity29 commented : ’ it was certainly not as good as on thursday ( he shot 66 ) and that can happen when you have n’t played for a while			1
but i like my position going into the weekend			0
’ it ’s not only @entity17 and @entity19 who will be hoping this does n’t develop into a two - man race to rival the one going on an hour from here on the @entity42 circuit at @entity43			1
@entity45 @entity44 , helped considerably by a hole in one at the 13th – he hit a seven iron - is only three behind after a 71 and then there ’s @entity49			1
at four over par for his first ten holes on thursday , the idea that he could be in a good position to win was fanciful			1
the @entity20 , however , has shown the pride of a major champion in the 26 holes that have followed to play them in 11 under par and move from dead last to just three adrift			0
‘ it ’s not the first time i ’ve made a slow start to a tournament and maybe it ’s something i need to look at , ’ conceded @entity61			0
‘ i was even four over par early on when i came back to win the @entity66			2
here there was n’t a lot of positivity going on walking down the 11th hole after a long season , to be honest , but i probably relaxed and that ’s when you often play your best golf			2
’ @entity5 walks alongside fellow overnight leader @entity44 ( second right ) during round two @entity4 ( right ) stands alongside his caddie on the 18th green during the second round of the tournament @entity61 finished second here to @entity5 two years ago when he shot a wondrous 62 on the final day , only to come up short as the @entity29 concluded with five straight birdies			1
with a number of tees moved up , scoring was suitably low on day two			0
@entity87 @entity86 began with five straight birdies on his way to a 64 to join @entity61 on seven under			0
@entity89 and @entity90 rebounded from poor first rounds with scores of 66 and 69 respectively			2
@entity61 came to the 18th with seven birdies on his card and an obvious opportunity to make it eight on this par five			0
the tee had been moved up 90 yards to bring it easily within range of two blows but @entity61 was caught out , and hit his drive flush into the creek that winds its way menacingly down the hole			0
@entity44 ( left ) plays his third shot on the par five 18th and is tied fifth after round two in @entity107 ‘ i played beautifully to that point and that ’s the only shot i ’d certainly want back , ’ he said			1
‘ to be honest , when i hit it i thought it was going to be perfect and i was surprised to see it finish in the hazard			0
’ asked how he would sum up a year in which he has won on both sides of the @entity116 , was a star at the @entity118 , but has fallen from fourth to seventh in the world , @entity61 replied : ’ i ’d give it a b - or maybe a b because of the @entity118			2
the thing that has been missing is that i played some good golf in the majors but was never able to do it for four rounds			0
’ now he goes in search of the win that , given the calibre of the players ahead of him , might even cause the campaign to be upgraded to a b plus should he pull it off .			2

@entity5 cards a second round of 70 to trail leader @entity4
@entity4 shot a six - under 66 and leads the competition by two strokes
@entity5 *gearing* up to cut @entity4 *'s* lead and win the season - ending event
