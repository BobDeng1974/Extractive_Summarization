@entity0 have sacked manager @entity1 in the wake of saturday ’s humiliating 4 - 0 defeat at home to @entity5			1
the result leaves the @entity0 one point and one place above the drop zone and owner @entity10 believes a change of manager is needed to avoid relegation			1
@entity1 – who leaves after 17 months in charge – was informed of the club ’s decision having taken training at the @entity18 on monday morning			1

a statement on the club 's website confirmed the news on monday afternoon , in which @entity10 said : ' i would like to thank @entity1 for his endeavours during his time at the club , in particular last season ’s " great escape " and cup final appearance , which will live long in the memory of every @entity0 fan			1
goalkeeper @entity40 looks dejected as @entity0 were thrashed at home by @entity5 @entity42 scored two of @entity5 's goals in the 4 - 0 win on saturday @entity47 's number of days in charge since his arrival on october 8 , 2013			1
75 - the @entity51 's number of games in charge , winning 23 , losing 22 and drawing 30			0
3 - the number of games against bitter rivals @entity54			0
he won them all with an aggregate of 6 - 1			0
35 - @entity1 was the 35th man to manage @entity0 either permanently or as a caretaker			1
22 - the number of years between @entity0 's appearances in a major final			2
@entity1 took them to the 2014 @entity65 final , 22 years on from their defeat to @entity68 in the @entity70 showpiece			2
14 - @entity0 's final position in @entity1 's first season			1
4 - the amount of games won in the @entity77 by @entity0 this season			2
the joint - worst with bottom side @entity79			0
' sadly , we have not made the progress that any of us had hoped for this season and we find ourselves battling , once again , at the wrong end of the table			0
we have therefore made the difficult decision that a change is needed			0
' @entity1 ’s position had become untenable after a breakdown in relationship with @entity26 and the club ’s fans , thousands of whom streamed for the exits with the team trailing by four at half - time against @entity5			2
a handful of supporters even tried to storm the dugout while some targeted the directors ’ box – including chief executive @entity102 - leaving the club hierarchy in no doubt that a change was necessary			0
@entity107 boss @entity106 has already spoken to the club about a short - term deal until the end of the season and he could be installed before saturday ’s trip to @entity113			2
@entity114 is close to @entity115 – they worked together at @entity116 and @entity117 – and he is thought to have recommended @entity118 for the role			0
the new man will inherit a team which has won just once in 12 matches and is without a home goal in more than five hours			0
@entity1 leaves @entity0 after just over a year in charge @entity1 was appointed by @entity0 in october 2013 following the sacking of @entity126 they were dumped out of the @entity70 by @entity128 @entity127 last month and away fans fought among themselves at @entity130			1
bizarrely , @entity1 blamed the @entity131 for @entity0 ’s woes after that game but his excuses did not wash with supporters			1
former @entity136 and @entity107 manager @entity106 is one name in the frame to take over the goodwill generated by last season ’s @entity65 final appearance and their escape from relegation in the final weeks of the campaign had long since evaporated and few fans will be mourning his departure			1
@entity1 ’s backroom team of @entity148 and @entity149 are also expected to leave the club			0
the next home match sees @entity152 rivals @entity54 visit the @entity153 on @entity154			0
