by @entity0 @entity1 believes keeping @entity2 competitive in their barren years has been the most important achievement of his reign			1
winning last season 's @entity7 final gave the @entity9 their first piece of silverware in nine years , a trophy drought which had seen some question whether the 64 - year - old @entity14 was still the right man to take the club forward			1
having delivered three @entity17 titles since taking charge in 1996 , @entity1 has also overseen a move to the @entity20 - a decision which left the club unable to compete financially with other title rivals for almost a decade			1
with the purse strings also loosened as the loans taken out to build their new home were repaid , @entity1 has finally been able to flex his muscles in the transfer market - breaking the club 's transfer record last year to sign @entity45 and acquiring @entity46 forward @entity47 this summer			1
but it was those years of battling against free - spending sides like @entity50 and @entity51 , as well as rivals such as @entity53 and @entity54 , which @entity1 admits he may remember more fondly in the years to come			1
' i accepted the challenge when i signed my contract knowing what would happen , ' he said			1
' personally , i think it was the most sensitive and important period of my career here - it was exciting to keep the club at the level with less resources			2
' did we do well or not ? the only thing i can say is that we were consistent at that level but maybe we lacked some quality to really win it			2
' the only thing i can assure you is that i gave absolutely everything to do as well as i could			2
is it enough ? you 'll never know			0
could someone had done better ? you never know			0
' the wait is over ! @entity2 ended their seven - year trophy drought by winning the @entity76 at @entity77 with the @entity7 success behind him , @entity1 penned another contract extension at the club , with the new three - year deal taking him up until 2017			1
negotiations over the deal were lengthy and , although @entity1 is adamant he always wanted to sign , he would not be drawn on whether victory in the cup final played a part in his decision			1
' i do n't want to answer that question , ' he replied when asked if there would have been doubt over his future without the trophy win			2
' was it always going to happen ? certainly			0
i always said the same thing , i want to think that i have done well for the club			2
my motivation was never at stake , i always wanted to stay			0
' but as well i wanted to feel that i had done a good job			0
the fact that we could not win was going on my mind and it was important for me to feel like i was doing a decent job			0
' i never look behind me at what is done			0
i look in front of me			0
i 'm always turned forward			0
we have won the cup but we want to win more and we want to come back and fight for more , what is done is done			0
' new era : @entity2 can compete in the transfer market again , brining in the likes of @entity47 a fourth @entity17 crown would be @entity1 's ideal target for this coming season , with another assault on the @entity115 also in his mind			1
with the extra money now at his disposal , he believes things are more even in @entity2 's fights with the elite			1
' i would say that the balance of power is a bit more even than it was five or six years ago , ' added @entity1			1
' with the financial fair play added to the fact we have more financial power than five years ago it gives us a better chance			0
' the last two seasons it has changed because we had the financial power to do it , the seasons before we could not and i was sitting here saying where do we go next , but we managed to get into a better position			0

@entity1 *insists* keeping @entity2 competitive has been his main achievement
@entity9 could not compete financially during move to the @entity20
@entity14 manager still guided the team to successive fourth place finishes
@entity2 ended seven year trophy drought by winning the 2013 @entity7
@entity148 club can now compete in the transfer market again and have signed the likes of @entity45 and @entity47
