when you weigh a whopping 36 stone , it â€™s probably not the brightest idea to go wandering across a frozen lake			2
and this moose found itself in a spot of serious trouble when the ice collapsed below and the water began to freeze around it as it struggled to get out			2
but help was at hand in the shape of a group of kind - hearted locals			0
armed with just a chainsaw and rope , a team of eight people freed the female moose in a heroic feat. a terrified moose slipped through ice and was trapped in frozen @entity24 for 45 minutes before an incredible rescue the female moose , weighing nearly 36 stone , bobbed her head above the icy water and awaited to be freed from the ice passing travellers , truck drivers and locals came to her rescue using a chainsaw and rope the animal had been trapped in frozen @entity24 in northern @entity38 , @entity39 for 45 minutes before a group of passing travellers , truck drivers and locals spotted her bobbing head above the ice			1
they started off by using a chainsaw to cut the ice around her , and then tied a rope around the trapped moose before they pulled her to safety after 15 minutes and four attempts			1
the rescue was caught on camera by @entity39 wildlife and nature photographer , @entity57 , who spied the moose in the lake while he was on a trip with friends @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65			1
@entity57 , 31 , from @entity66 , @entity38 , said : ' every spring my friends and i go on a river boating trip up the @entity70 and as we were driving by @entity24 we noticed a bunch of people on the lake and a head of a moose sticking out of the ice			1
' in the spring time , when the snow starts to melt , the ice on the lake starts to get rotten			0
so , as this moose walked out onto the ice , she fell through with no way out			1
' i have never seen anything like it			0
' rescuers cut ice around her and then tied a rope around the trapped animal before a team of eight pulled her out by hand the rescue took four attempts before she was successfully pulled free from the frozen lake lucky to be alive ! once the moose was freed and the rope was cut from her neck she had a few injuries from the incident working on perilously thin ice and with a potentially aggressive moose , the rescuers were well aware of the challenging conditions they faced			1
saving the moose was dangerous and the rescuers were all worried about their friend @entity65 , who they hoped did not slip through the ice while trying to get the rope around the animal 's neck , said @entity57			2
' the ice was so rotten and the lake was particularly deep in this spot , so we tied a rope around @entity65 's waist in case he fell through the surface , ' he said			2
' we sent him out on the ice as he was the smallest guy and we hoped the ice would support him			0
' the moose was scared at first because one of the guys had a chainsaw cutting a trail in the ice , but once we got her out she calmed down and let us cut the rope off			0
' working on perilously thin ice and with a potentially aggressive moose , the rescuers were well aware of the challenging conditions they faced @entity57 , a @entity39 wildlife and nature photographer ( above ) , photographed the ordeal as his friends rescued the animal @entity57 said the moose walked into the mountains and stopped to look back ' like she was saying thanks ' before continuing her journey following the ordeal , many people have hailed @entity57 and his friends as heroes for saving the animal , he said			0
' we were just doing what anyone would do , ' said @entity57			0
' after we got her out of the ice , @entity65 cut the rope , and then she simply walked into the mountains stopping to look back at us like she was saying thanks , then she continued on her journey			0
' i would just like to say that this kind of thing happens a lot on frozen lakes around the world , we just happened to be in the right place at the right time when this moose fell through , she was lucky			1
