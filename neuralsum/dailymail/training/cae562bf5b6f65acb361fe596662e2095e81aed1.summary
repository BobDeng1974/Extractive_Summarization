energy secretary @entity0 claimed the green business interests of energy watchdog chief @entity2 were not conflict of interest energy secretary @entity0 has admitted he knew former @entity6 minister @entity2 had green business interests when he chose him to head the powerful government watchdog that sets targets for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions			1
but he insisted they did not amount to a conflict of interest – on the grounds they only concerned ‘ infrastructure ’ , not renewable power generation			0
last night critics dismissed this view as ‘ absurd ’			0
the @entity20 revealed earlier this year that mr @entity2 , now @entity2 , is chairman of both @entity21 , which connects windfarms to the @entity23 , and the @entity24			2
the committee ’s stringent , binding targets are the main reason why the grid is set to spend £ 25 billion on its network by 2020 – a big factor in soaring household energy bills			2
this newspaper ’s disclosure about @entity21 triggered a long correspondence – published last week after a @entity36 request – between @entity37 , @entity2 and mr @entity0			0
the latter said in a letter in may that he knew about @entity21 ’s energy business , but there was no conflict of interest because the firm was ‘ mainly involved in infrastructure projects ’			0
@entity47 mp @entity46 , a prominent climate sceptic , was scathing about mr @entity0 ’s role : ‘ the whole of our energy policy has been distorted by green lobbyists			1
to say there is no conflict because @entity21 is only involved in energy infrastructure is patently absurd			1
’ last night @entity20 asked @entity2 how much @entity21 is paying him and how he could avoid making @entity58 decisions that might benefit the firm			0
mr @entity2 , pictured second from left with @entity60 , @entity62 chief executive @entity61 and mp @entity63 , is the chairman of @entity21 , which connects wind farms to the @entity23			1

@entity2 is chairman of a firm which connects wind farms
but he also leads a committee in charge of setting green energy targets
now energy secretary admits he knew *-* but insists there was no *problem*
@entity47 climate sceptic @entity46 said that claim is ' patently absurd '
