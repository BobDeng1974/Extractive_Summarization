by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has urged his @entity5 squad not to fall into the trap he did as a player and wilt under play - off pressure			1
the under - 21s will discover the identity of the opponents standing in their way of @entity13 when the draw is made on friday and @entity3 intends to draw on personal experience to help this group through their biggest test			1
@entity18 was the star of the show in @entity20 for @entity21 as he bagged a brace @entity3 played in the second leg of @entity5 ’s clash with @entity25 at @entity26 in november 1999 and he remembers how a team containing @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 almost threw away a place at @entity32 as the occasion got to them			1
he does , however , want the under - 21s to experience the tension of a game when , potentially , one mistake could lead to a year ’s work unravelling , as @entity3 is adamant it will accelerate their development			1
‘ i played in the debacle at home , ’ @entity3 recalled			1
‘ we were under more pressure at @entity26			2
everyone expected @entity48 to be the game when it would be tough but @entity51 got a couple of goals early and it killed that match			2
‘ but there is something about [ having a lead ] that makes everyone anxious			0
there were top players that night who just could n’t keep the ball			0
i can remember some of our top players giving it away all the time			0
it ’s something we will have to deal with			0
’ @entity68 challenges for the ball during the @entity21 showdown between @entity20 and the @entity71 a 3 - 0 victory in @entity20 on tuesday stretched @entity5 ’s winning run under @entity3 to eight games but there is no sense that the comfortable manner in which they have been winning games will breed complacency in the group			1
dangers lurk throughout the draw - @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 are all in the mix , while the potential for a reunion with @entity90 remains on the cards - but @entity3 is happy for his squad to be scrutinised			1
‘ i strongly believe that if they do the right things , as they have done , then they will get there , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ if they do n’t , then it is another two big , pressure games they have been involved in			0
we will review it and move on			0
that is how it works			0
‘ in the club game , and in the seniors , sometimes that pressure can mean change			0
you have to live with that as a head coach			0
that ’s not necessarily where we are at this age group			2
it is a positive pressure rather than a negative pressure			0
‘ we want to go and test ourselves against the best			2
we want to start achieving things so the other teams at @entity118 ’s see us and think “ they were the first group to win the under - 21s ”			1
’ @entity3 looks on during the clash between @entity122 and @entity21			2
