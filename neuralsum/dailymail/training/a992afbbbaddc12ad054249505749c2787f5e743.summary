by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 admits he would back himself to score a penalty for @entity4 at the @entity5 in @entity6 this summer , having previously held his nerve in a shootout			1
it was at the @entity11 @entity10 in 2009 that the goalkeeper converted during the shootout victory over @entity14 — and he also tucked one away for @entity15 against @entity16			1
@entity17 : @entity2 scored a penalty in the shoot out win over @entity14 in the @entity21 in 2009 one - on - one : @entity2 speaks to @entity22 's @entity0 during a media goalkeeping masterclass @entity4 , of course , have gone out of six of the past 10 major inter-national tournaments via penalties and @entity2 was in goal at the @entity30 two years ago when @entity31 were their spot - kick conquerors			1
this time , the 27 - year - old says he would have no issue with stepping up as one of @entity4 ’s penalty - takers			1
‘ i ’d be confident enough to take one , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’d never say no if i was asked and you never know — i ’ve seen it happen before			2
‘ i quite enjoy taking them and , although it probably wo n’t come down to me , i ’d have no problem			2
i ’ve done it before			2
’ it was the policy of under 21 boss @entity43 to select the players who were finding the back of the net in training — and that was enough to see @entity2 installed as his second taker			1
taste for it : @entity2 celebrates ... but will he be gleaming after scoring a penalty in the @entity5 ? seasoned pro : @entity2 will be going to his third major tournament with @entity4 fresh from celebrating @entity15 ’s second @entity56 title in three seasons , @entity2 said : ‘ we ’d been practising them daily with @entity43 and i ’d scored most of mine			1
his system was that he went with the lads who were scoring — and i was scoring			0
‘ he was confident in me and i was confident in myself and i ended up putting it away			0
’ @entity2 ’s prime objective , of course , will be saving penalties should @entity4 find themselves involved in another shootout in @entity6			1
he was beaten by @entity69 ’s chip in 2012 and the @entity70 has since revealed that @entity2 ’s decision to dive early prompted his audacious effort			1
all fronts : fresh from celebrating @entity15 's title win , @entity2 is looking for even greater success this summer three @entity77 : @entity4 face @entity31 on june 14 in @entity78 to kick off their @entity5 campaign ‘ that was his way of scoring and that ’s fair enough — if the ball crosses the line it ’s a good penalty , no matter what you do , ’ @entity2 said , ‘ but all penalty - takers are different			1
‘ @entity91 ( @entity92 ) is one of the best and he picks his spot beforehand , others change their mind			0
‘ i watch a lot of penalties before a game in preparation			2
it ’s a big moment			0
you need to prepare as best you can			0
‘ that means watching the dvds and working on them in training			0
we do that a lot in tournament football because it can be so crucial			0
full stretch : @entity2 wants to have his own ' @entity110 moment ' for @entity4 at this summer 's @entity5 ‘ sadly , at the end of the dvd it does n’t say , “ this is the way he will definitely go ” , but what it can do is give you that slight percentage advantage and that might make the difference			1
’ should @entity4 make it to a shootout many observers will already feel they have surpassed expectation			2
a group which contains @entity31 , @entity126 and @entity127 could prove difficult to negotiate , although @entity2 says @entity129 ’s men are taking little notice of their outsider status			1
‘ we ’ll be confident , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of lads have had very good seasons			0
i feel that we ’ve improved over the past two years under the new manager			0
we ’re playing as a unit and there is a good feel to the team			0
‘ we ’ve got a very good mix of youth and experience and i honestly think we could surprise a few people			0

the @entity4 goalkeeper *insists* @entity129 can back him to score
@entity2 has scored two penalties before - one for @entity4 at the @entity21 in 2009 , and another for @entity15 in *pre-season*
@entity4 face @entity31 on june 14 in @entity78 in their first @entity152 game
