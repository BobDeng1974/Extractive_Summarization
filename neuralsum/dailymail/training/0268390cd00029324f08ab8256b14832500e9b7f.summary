by mail online reporter published : 11:34 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:38 est , 24 february 2014 at first , these images look like a 21st century ink - blot test , designed to test the viewer 's unconscious mind with random patterns and shapes			0
they were even created by an @entity11 psychologist @entity10 , 49 , but these kaleidoscopic pictures are nothing to do with his work and are just for fun			2
mr @entity10 , who refers to his work as ' smokreations ' , created the pictures using incense smoke , an ordinary camera and some photoshop skills			1
@entity10 layered an image of incense smoke before using a mirrored effect on editing software to create the snowflake - like pattern mr @entity10 lets the random smoke shapes dictate the final picture			1
it was n't until he turned this image upside down that he noticed the grasshopper , then used different colours to pick it out mr @entity10 says his psychedelic images have been well - received online and at art shows he has participated in ' i 've always enjoyed the patterns made by kaleidoscopes or some geometric screen - savers , ' says mr @entity10 , of @entity39 , @entity40			2
' i remember as a kid looking for shapes in clouds and smoke			0
sometimes they clearly resemble specific things like a face or animal , while some are less clear , people see different things in all of my work			0
' it 's a stress reliever for me since it is so completely different from my job			0
' working with a normal digital slr camera and a black or white background , @entity10 uses incense smoke to produce his creations			1
mr @entity10 says he makes the images as a stress - relief activity after a hard day at work he took up photography by capturing images of buildings and nature , but switched to smoke photographs after reading about some of the effects that could be achieved in a book mr @entity10 says that as a child he used to imagine shapes in clouds and smoke , and that adults see something different in his pictures the images are then finalised using software , such as @entity80 , where he can use mirror effects and introduce striking colours to add the final touches to the mesmerizing patterns			1
@entity10 explains : ' in the case of the green insect - like photograph , the smoke was duplicated and layered on itself and the whole thing was flipped upside down			2
' then the grasshopper creature was seen , i added the colour in @entity80 to make it fit with the insect - like creature i saw			0
' the frosted smoke flake was more complicated , the smoke photo was layered multiple times , the photo was tinted in @entity80 , and the edges were added with a @entity80 plug - in for the final result			0
' @entity10 's artistic experiments with smoke followed his existing interest in photography			2
mr @entity10 says he was also mesmerised by patterns in kaleidoscopes and geometric screen - savers using editing tools allows mr @entity10 to create impossible patterns from the smoke , such as this disc which has a plume passing through its centre he said : ' i started shooting waterfalls , nature , and architecture a number of years ago			1
' i really became interested in smoke photography however from a book i read , and began playing with the artistic possibilities when you add certain effects to the images			1
' ultimately , the random shapes that occur in the smoke usually are what lead me toward a particular design			0
this image , created from two identical plumes of smoke , looks a little like milk mixing into coffee mr @entity10 usually takes his pictures against a black or white background , but has opted for a blue one here , making the purple pattern really stand out ' i have had very positive reactions from the photography websites that i am a member of , and art shows that i have participated in			1
' i have also inspired others to try smoke photo art , which is of course really great			0

@entity10 , a psychologist , creates the images in his spare time
he uses incense smoke to make the *initial* pattern but will fine tune it
he uses editing software to add colour and create mirrored effects
