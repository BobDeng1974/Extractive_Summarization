research by a team of @entity3 physicists could explain why the universe did not collapse immediately after the @entity5			0
studies of the @entity8 particle suggested that the very early accelerating universe should have been unstable - and scientists have been trying to work out why this was not the case			1
but this latest study suggests that the @entity8 may have actually interacted in gravity in such a way that enabled the universe to survive			2
physicists from @entity18 say gravity saved the early universe ( evolution of the cosmos shown )			1
they say it interacted with the @entity8 to provide stability 13.8 billion years ago			1
it was thought the @entity8 particle should have made the cosmos unstable , but gravity helped to provide stability physicists from @entity18 , and the universities of @entity30 and @entity31 believe this simple explanation could explain the beginning of the universe			1
in the new study in @entity37 , the team describe how the spacetime curvature - in effect , gravity - provided the stability needed for the universe to survive expansion in that early period 13.8 billion years ago			2
the team investigated the interaction between the @entity8 particles and gravity , taking into account how it would vary with energy			2
and they showed that even a small interaction would have been enough to stabilise the universe against decay			2
the @entity8 's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. it has been described as the ‘ missing piece ’ of the @entity58 , which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another without this mass , particles would zip around the cosmos , unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people			1
the particle was confirmed using the @entity70 - the highest - energy particle collider ever made , built by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) in 2012			0
however , our knowledge of particle physics is still far from complete , with mysteries such as the nature of dark matter to still be solved			0
it was thought that , under current models of physics , @entity8 particles would have been created in abundance in the early universe and caused instability , ultimately leading to its demise			1
but the researchers found that , at high levels of gravity not possible to recreate in the present day on @entity91 , gravitational fields actually prevented the production of these @entity8 particles			2
professor @entity93 , from the @entity94 at @entity18 who was part of the study , told @entity97 this means that our current models of physics are capable of explaining this instability in the early universe - whereas previously they had been thought to be inadequate			1
this is because they predict that the production of @entity8 particles should cause the universe to collapse			0
but professor @entity93 's study suggests that under our current @entity58 of physics , gravity would actually have come to the rescue and prevented them from forming			0
‘ we considered the interaction of the @entity8 field with the gravitational field , and this is something that is not known because we ca n’t measure it in particle accelerators , ’ he said			0
‘ we looked at this interaction and basically you need to have a strong gravitational field to act as a barrier against producing @entity8 particles in the very early universe			1
’ he explains that the production of @entity8 particles would have caused instability but ‘ gravity prevented it ’ , allowing the universe to survive			0
however proving this is true would be difficult , as it would require similar gravitational strength to a black hole , but professor @entity93 says it is a promising solution as to how the universe remained stable in the fraction of a second after it formed			0
the @entity8 's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. the particle was confirmed in 2012 using the @entity70 - pictured - the highest - energy particle collider ever made , built by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) ' the @entity58 of particle physics , which scientists use to explain elementary particles and their interactions , has so far not provided an answer to why the universe did not collapse following the @entity5 , ' professor @entity93 said in a press release			1
' our research investigates the last unknown parameter in the @entity58 - the interaction between the @entity8 particle and gravity			1
' this parameter can not be measured in particle accelerator experiments , but it has a big effect on the @entity8 instability during inflation			0
' even a relatively small value is enough to explain the survival of the universe without any new physics ! ' the team plan to continue their research using cosmological observations to look at this interaction in more detail and explain what effect it would have had on the development of the early universe			1
in particular , they will use data from current and future @entity166 missions measuring cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves			0
' our aim is to measure the interaction between gravity and the @entity8 using cosmological data , ' said professor @entity93			0
' if we are able to do that , we will have supplied the last unknown number in the @entity58 of particle physics and be closer to answering fundamental questions about how we are all here			0

physicists from @entity18 say gravity saved early universe
they say it interacted with the @entity8 to provide stability
it was thought the @entity8 particle should have made the cosmos unstable
this meant it would not have survived much *longer* than a split second
but a small interaction with gravity would have provided stability at the high energy present in the universe .
this ultimately led to the formation of *galaxies* , stars and planets
