by @entity0 published : 15:32 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 20:12 est , 14 june 2013 an ' update ' of the scrabble app on social networking site @entity4 has left players lost for words			1
after @entity8 took over the running of the online game from @entity13 brand owner @entity11 , it decided to revamp its game structure			1
sadly , these changes have not gone down with with seasoned players , with the key bone of contention being that player history has been deleted			1
outrage : the ' updated ' version of @entity4 app @entity13 has been met with derision by loyal players this means that the aggregate win percentage of a player who has been gaming for years has been lost to the abyss			1
this has led players , not surprisingly , bombarding the @entity4 page for the popular game showing their disgust with the new format			2
other changes include the dictionary being changed from @entity36 to @entity37 , and the refresh stalling after a player 's turn			1
one post put by the page admin , totally unrelated to the ' update ' was met with a raft of negative comments			2
@entity46 wrote : ' the scrabble moment when u realise how only pure arrogance can fly in the face of such overwhelming opposition to the new format			0
. and still you just give the lot of us the @entity55 ! aw well ! @entity56 added : ' i miss playing @entity13 - please admit that you made a serious mistake and bring back the original game			1
' popular opinion : @entity46 's comment was ' liked ' 315 times negative : there is n't a positive comment in sight here and this was echoed by fellow fan @entity69 who wrote : ' that @entity13 moment when you discover that the game you loved to play had gone only to be replaced by a crap version ! ! ! ' disgruntled users also have a @entity4 group to air their discontent after ' please bring back the scrabble we love ' was set up			1
this has attracted more than 2,000 members			0
game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ‘ brash ’			1
bad move : unfortunately there is n't many ' likeable ' comments on this post @entity90 , 54 , a support worker from @entity91 said : ‘ i ’ve been playing for the past five years			0
i ’d play for around an hour of an evening when i come home from work			2
‘ i ’ve met some really interesting people			0
of course they do not substitute friends , but we had a community			0
i ’ve just had a grandchild and a lot of the people i played with knew that and would ask how it was going			0
such is the strong feeling on this , a petition has been set - up called : ' @entity13 - if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' by @entity106 from @entity107			0
on this petition , he writes : ' in the weeks running up sunday , 27th may 2013 , @entity11 promised a new “ improved ” version of @entity13			1
' in our opinion what was delivered is a great disappointment			0
judging by the comments left on @entity13 playing message boards , dissatisfaction is almost universal			0
there are very few if any of the community of players who have messaged anything positive about the changes ' we are now presented with a random playing partner and therefore can not choose against someone who regards themselves as a novice or against someone who considers themselves to be a serious player			1
' we enjoyed having the choice of whether or not play a 2 minute game or a week game			2
that choice has now been removed			0
' over 5,000 people have signed the petition so far			0
a spokesman for @entity11 said : ‘ the @entity13 @entity4 game is now managed by a new partner @entity140			1
' the benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices , the addition of the @entity146 , the ability to play in six languages , the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad - free			2
‘ as part of the transition , we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics , the timer mode and the manual match - making function			0
' the new version will have the same robust statistics moving forward			2

new ' update ' sees players ' gaming histories lost forever
gamers can no *longer* select who they wish to play against
@entity171 has been replaced by @entity37 version
but brand owner @entity11 back the update made by new partner @entity140
