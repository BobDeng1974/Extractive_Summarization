@entity0 completed his transfer to @entity2 on wednesday , as @entity3 sealed the signature of the highly - rated @entity6 starlet			1
the 17 - year - old has been told he will go straight into @entity3 's first - team squad			0
yes , despite the obvious need to strengthen his senior squad , @entity3 has forked out a seven - figure sum to land @entity6 teenager @entity0			1
@entity3 has bought @entity0 for a reported £ 2.5million			2
should n’t he have spent on an established player ? possibly but the @entity24 were not the only club chasing @entity0			2
@entity27 , in @entity26 , had also registered an interest in the 17 - year - old and would have completed a move this month if @entity2 had n’t swooped			1
he made his debut for @entity16 when he was only 16			0
he played six times for the club , including once in the @entity35 , before putting pen to paper on a deal to take him to @entity39			0
@entity0 plays on his phone at the airport on his journey to @entity43 for a @entity35 match with @entity45 ok , so what are his attributes ? at 6ft 2in , @entity0 seems physically equipped for the @entity48			2
@entity3 has described him as an energetic central midfielder and his manager at @entity16 , former @entity52 player @entity51 , believes @entity0 has a maturity in his play that is beyond his years			1
' he has good techniques , is able to keep the ball , ' @entity51 is quoted as saying in legia.sport			0
' for his age he has a very developed ability to make appropriate decisions			0
personality sets him on the field			0
' at the first training was a kid who wanted to kick the ball			0
in his debut , he played as if it was just another game			0
we had to teach him tactically , but individual skill was already at a high level			0
' @entity16 manager @entity51 was impressed by @entity0 during his time in @entity6 the new @entity13 ? it ’s too early to make such grand claims but those who have watched @entity0 report many similarities			1
@entity0 thrives as a holding midfielder but his versatility means he also provides an option in central defence			1
@entity51 's claims of @entity0 's clever decision making in that area of the field would certainly align him with the likes of the former @entity2 captain , whose commanding presence on the pitch has never been replaced by @entity3			1
if he can nurture @entity0 's potential , then perhaps he may have found a successor			2
many similarities have been made between @entity0 and former @entity2 midfielder @entity13			1

@entity0 *secured* his move to @entity2 on wednesday
the young midfielder has drawn similarities with @entity13
@entity99 side @entity27 had also registered an interest in the youngster
