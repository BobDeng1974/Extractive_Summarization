by @entity1 reporter published : 13:13 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 13:26 est , 6 july 2013 gassing : @entity4 prisoners on death row could face the gas chamber when drug supplies run out prisoners on death row in @entity4 are facing possible execution in the gas chamber due to a dwindling supply of lethal - injection drugs in the state			1
the state ’s attorney general , @entity14 , is pressuring the @entity16 into carrying out pending executions under its current lethal - injection protocol before the drug supplies run out			1
it comes in the wake of a boycott on sales of medical drugs for executions by drugs companies in the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , which have refused on ethical grounds to sell their products to corrections departments			1
the @entity34 has also imposed tougher restrictions on the export of anaesthetics to the @entity28 , banning the export of drugs for lethal injection in 2011 , under the @entity41			1
in a statement this week , @entity14 said the state will be forced to start using the gas chamber as an alternative			2
‘ unless the [ supreme ] court changes its current course , the legislature will soon be compelled to fund statutorily - authorised alternative methods of execution to carry out lawful judgments , ’ @entity14 said			2
under @entity4 law only two forms of execution are permitted , ‘ by means of the administration of lethal gas or by means of the administration of lethal injection ’ , he said			1
after switching from hanging in 1937 as its preferred method of judicial killing , the gas chamber has not been used in the state since 1965			0
the use of lethal injection was first used in @entity66 in 1982			1
strapped down : prisoners are normally killed by lethal injection but that might change soon lethal injection : @entity69 is the drug used to kill death row inmates in the one - injection protocol , only enforced in the state of @entity4			1
the drug also killed pop icon , @entity75 death row : the prisoners awaiting execution in @entity4 challenged the one - injection protocol with propofol saying it causes ' excruciating pain ' @entity14 , the attorney general of @entity4 , wants to bring back the gas chamber two methods of lethal injection exist today , one using a three - drug protocol and another using one large dose of a barbiturate or propofol – the latter being the drug that the ‘ @entity75 ’ , @entity75 , overdosed on			1
last year @entity4 became the only state in the country to apply the execution protocol using just one large dose of propofol			0
however , the new protocol was challenged by 21 of the state ’s death row inmates , who argued it was a violation of the @entity28 constitution as it created the likelihood of ‘ foreseeable infliction of excruciating pain in the course of executing the plaintiffs ’ , according to @entity106			0
that caused the @entity4 supreme court to refuse to schedule any more execution dates until the question of the constitutionality of the new method of death is settled			0
but now the state 's limited supply of propofol is running out			0
according to @entity14 , the @entity117 has only three quantities of propofol remaining			2
the oldest quantity expires this october , the next batch expires in may 2014 , and the newest supply expires in 2015			0
earlier this week , on july 1 , @entity14 filed new motions asking the judges to give him the green light to carry out the executions of two death row inmates , @entity128 and @entity129 , before the drugs expire			1
@entity131 : @entity14 is calling for the immediate execution of death row inmates , @entity134 ( left ) , who murdered 20 people , and @entity129 , who killed three @entity137 , 63 , is a serial killer who has been linked to 20 murders , six aggravated assaults , 16 bank robberies and two bombings			1
@entity129 , 42 , killed three people in 1994 who had offered to help him when his car broke down on the road to @entity146			2
‘ not only has the delay prevented those affected by mr @entity129 ’s crimes from receiving the closure they deserve , it has also put at risk the @entity156 ’s ability to administer capital punishment at all , ’ said @entity14 in the motion			1
@entity158 , of the @entity159 , said he believes the threats of bringing back the gas chamber are a political ploy , directed at the state supreme court			0
‘ he 's trying to prod the court into dropping its objections and setting execution dates by threatening that @entity4 might have to go back to the dark ages if they do n't act soon , " @entity158 told @entity106			0
each state that employs lethal injection is legally required to have detailed protocols for its practice , and though the set of rules differ from state to state , the process of killing a condemned inmate varies little			2
it begins with the lethal injection team securing the inmate to a gurney and connecting him to an electrocardiogram ( @entity184 ) machine that monitors heart activity			2
inserted into the inmate 's veins are two intravenous lines ( one as a backup ) that lead out of a separate infusion room , where members of the intravenous team monitor the initial harmless saline drip			0
at the warden 's signal , the execution chamber is exposed to witnesses in an adjoining room , and in states that use the three - drug protocol the inmate is injected with sodium thiopental or pentobarbital , anesthetics intended to put the inmate to sleep			0
presumably after a member of the intravenous team determines the inmate is sufficiently unconscious , he is then injected with pancuronium bromide , which paralyses the entire muscle system and stops the inmate 's breathing			0
in most cases , the inmate 's consciousness is again checked , and finally potassium chloride stops his heart			0
in ideal circumstances , death results from anesthetic overdose and respiratory and cardiac arrest while the condemned person is unconscious			0
the process of lethal injection using just one drug follows nearly the same procedure , except the inmate dies from the one large dose of anesthetic , either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital .			1

attorney general , @entity14 , calls for immediate execution of two *convicted* murderers , @entity128 and @entity129 , before drugs expire
drugs companies are refusing to sell products for lethal injection
the drug supplies will run out in 2015
