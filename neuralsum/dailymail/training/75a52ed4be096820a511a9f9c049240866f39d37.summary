a high - flying @entity1 exec with a passion for super-fast , top of the line sports cars has proved himself to have an equally good sense of humor , when it comes to his boy 's toys			1
as vice president of engineering and long - time @entity1 employee , @entity10 , 43 , became an instant millionaire at the time of the company ’s $ 23 billion ipo in 2004			1
that wealth has afforded @entity10 the finances to be able to indulge his passion for collecting some of the most exclusive sports cars around , including a @entity21 , a @entity22 , and a @entity23 , which he keeps in his six - car garage			1
dream team : @entity1 's @entity10 shows off five of his fancy sports car car lover : @entity10 and his wife collect a @entity22 after recently bidding the highest for it in a charity auction in sept in @entity32 , @entity33 @entity10 is n’t shy about his collection either and as with any self respecting tech nerd he is very active in chat forums sharing his passion with other sports car nuts			1
sometimes @entity10 ’s candidness about his car collection has got him into trouble with other forum members of the @entity43 performance forum , most of whom can only dream of having a car collection as exotic as his			0
one forum member recently questioned if @entity10 could really own all the top of the lines vehicles which he claims too and challenged him to prove he owned what he said he did with an usual task involving placing bread on some of his most exclusive rides			2
' i do n’t think you ’re real			0
i request a picture of your new @entity59 with a piece of bread on the hood , ' wrote one poster , who posted under the username @entity21 - racer			0
@entity10 may be very important and very rich , but as is the @entity1 ethos he is also something of a regular guy - as he proved by rising to the challenge set by his forum buddy			2
not only did @entity10 comply on sunday by posting a picture of his extremely rare @entity23 , but he photographed some @entity73 crumpets on top , as befitting a @entity76 - built vehicle			1
for this photograph of his @entity78 , @entity10 photographed some @entity73 crumpets as befitting a @entity76 - built vehicle @entity10 placed a loaf of @entity82 on top of his @entity85 raptor on the bonnet of his @entity22 , @entity10 placed a long loaf of @entity89 bread @entity10 captioned his @entity23 photo saying ' the art and science of the @entity76 sports car lives on at @entity23 , and nothing says " @entity95 " like crumpets ! ' he did n't stop there either , for a photo of his brand - new high - performance @entity21 truck , @entity10 placed a loaf of @entity82 @entity102			1
' nothing says " @entity85 " like ' @entity104 ' , and what better pairing than a great loaf of @entity82 ? ' he wrote			0
then on top of his @entity22 he placed @entity89 bread			1
he wrote : ' nothing complements the smell of fine @entity89 leather like the smell of fresh @entity89 bread ! ' @entity116 , real name @entity115 , told @entity117 that he knew @entity10 was legit , but came up with the bread on the hood idea as an inside joke after the @entity1 exec was called out by someone else on the forum			1
on the @entity125 forum user ford_racer asked @entity10 to post pictures of bread on his cars sense of humor : further evidence of @entity10 's humor can be found on his @entity134 profile in the past , @entity10 had responded by posting a picture of his kid holding a sign that had the name of the @entity125 forum on it			2
' @entity10 is easily one of the more genuine and down to earth people on @entity125 , ' said @entity115			0
' he ’s never condescending or arrogant when showing off his toys , and he ’s clearly a genuine car enthusiast			0
' many , many well - off people will buy these types of cars and let them rot in a garage or drive them like old men			0
' in september , @entity10 won an auction to buy a @entity22 @entity151 that was being sold to benefit victims of an earthquake in @entity33			0
@entity10 , who has been at @entity1 for nine years , carries a lot of responsibility and as the company ’s site reliability tsar it is his job to ensure that their websites do n’t go down			0
joker : @entity10 displayed a great sense of humor by rising to the silly challenge @entity1 exec @entity10 , 43 , has a car collection most people can only dream about			2
