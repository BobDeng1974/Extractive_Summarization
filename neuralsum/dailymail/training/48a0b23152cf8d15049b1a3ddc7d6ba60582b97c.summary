by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 20:39 est , 14 march 2013 scandal : mp sir @entity3 , who died in 2010 , tried to interfere with an investigation into his child abuse in 1970 , new documents revealed today sir @entity3 tried to bully police after they launched an investigation into claims he molested young boys , according to files			1
the late politician went to a police station in 1970 and demanded to know why detectives were investigating the claims			1
officers later submitted a file to prosecutors with a covering letter that said : ‘ he appears guilty of indecent assault			2
’ during their meeting @entity3 tried to find out from officers who his accusers were and admitted approaching two of the teenagers			1
an officer then warned him about interfering with witnesses and accused the politician of ‘ fishing ’ for information , according to the records			2
last night an mp claimed the documents – released in a @entity34 request this week – prove that 30st @entity3 was trying to meddle with the police investigation			1
six weeks after his visit to @entity38 police station detectives passed the file to prosecutors , describing his conduct as ‘ inexcusable ’			2
their covering note added : ‘ he has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys to whom he had a special responsibility			2
he appears guilty of numerous offences of indecent assault			2
’ attempt : @entity3 was trying to find out the names of his accusers as he said it would impact on his electioneering in @entity38 the file , submitted by @entity54 , was examined by prosecutors who decided to take no further action against him			1
the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) has now admitted it should have prosecuted the politician after allegations of abuse in the 1960s			1
the decision not to prosecute left @entity3 free to prey on other vulnerable young children , it later emerged			1
meddling : ' the former @entity64 mp for @entity38 has been accused by the current one @entity65 , who says it shows how hard @entity3 tried to influence the police in 1972 – two years after the case was dropped – he won the @entity38 by - election for the @entity70 and served as mp until 1992			1
he died aged 82 in 2010			0
this week it emerged that @entity72 could also have been stopped from abusing children up to 50 years ago , but police failed to act on allegations			1
documents show that in january 1970 @entity3 , then a prominent @entity64 councillor , asked to meet detectives at @entity38 police station to find out the names of his accusers			1
a transcript of the conversation between @entity3 and detectives shows he was determined to challenge the police for launching an investigation			1
@entity3 began the meeting by asking bluntly : ‘ why are the inquiries going on ? ’ and ‘ whom did you approach for statements ? ’ he also asked what stage the police had reached in their inquiry and when he would know if he was to be charged			1
@entity65 , @entity92 mp for @entity38 , said the documents prove @entity3 tried to bring pressure to bear on the police to drop charges			1
@entity3 was accused of inflicting humiliating punishments on teenage boys in the 1960s and 70s at a hostel he had helped to set up			1
his victims say he would spank their naked bottoms and order them to strip for ‘ degrading ’ medicals despite a doctor not being present			0
it emerged that between 1970 and 1998 police tried to have him charged three times but when his 80 - page file was first passed to the @entity109 it was marked ‘ no further action ’			1
last year the @entity57 admitted @entity3 avoided prosecution only because sex abuse cases were dealt with differently 40 years ago			1
for decades , damaging rumours swirled around @entity38 mp sir @entity3 - a political legend locally and nationally			1
but despite police 40 years ago being convinced he had indecently assaulted young boys , the 30 - stone @entity64 never faced justice			1
today a transcript of a conversation her had with police shows how he tried to ' interfere ' with their investigation			2
saturday january 24 , 1970 - 11.20am , @entity38 police station officer : well , very briefly the allegations concerning that , are that you went along there and examined these boys by taking their pants down			1
whether that 's right or not , i do n't know			0
@entity133 : i understand that that 's the subject of the investigation			0
officer : which , pending on what explanation you put forward , would seem improper			0
officer : if my information is right , you spoke to one of the boys , who has been interviewed			0
officer : what was that about ? @entity133 : he told me what you had been asking him			0
he told me he had made a statement to you			0
i 've seen two of them and the third came to see me			2
i 've asked them if they have made statements			2
officer : i must warn you about interfering with witnesses			0
the only reason i am here this morning is because you wanted to see me			0
i did not want to see you			0
you must have some suspicion about you and them , about what 's in the statements or you would not be here , would you ? @entity133 : well - er - i 'm hesitating , not because i 'm frightened , but i 've seen a solicitor obviously , and he says i must make no statement or answer no questions			2
if they want to question you on those lines , tell them that you have appointed a solicitor			0
it 's not that i 'm afraid to answer the questions , it 's purely because i 'm advised not to do			0
officer : what you have come on this morning is just a fishing expedition			0
you want to see what we know			0
@entity133 : well , yes , fishing - i think that is fair comment			0
but one of my problems is - i do n't know if you know about local affairs			0
officer : no , i have no connection locally			0
@entity133 : well the situation is this			0
in three weeks time , i 've got to give a decision , one way or another , whether i 'm going to fight the next parliamentary election as a @entity64 in @entity38 , and if i 'm going to be charged , i 'm not going to accept			1
guilty or not guilty , it would be unfair to the party			0
on the other hand , if i am not going to be charged i would like to have a do , and i have got to make my mind up in the next three weeks .			2
