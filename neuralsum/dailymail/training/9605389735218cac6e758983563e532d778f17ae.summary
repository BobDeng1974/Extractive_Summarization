while shop mannequins in the @entity3 were criticised recently for being too thin , a window display in @entity1 is attracting a different kind of controversy by featuring pregnant children			1
three dummies have been placed in a shopping mall in @entity9 showing children with bulging stomachs dressed in over-sized school uniforms as part of a ' back to school ' display			1
the figurines were designed by two children 's charities attempting to raise awareness of the country 's child pregnancy rate , which is among the highest in @entity22			1
problem : two children 's charities teamed up to produce the shocking display , which is designed to highlight @entity1 's child pregnancy rate which is among the highest in @entity22 disgust : the designers say that while some people praise the mannequins for drawing attention to the problem of child pregnancy , others have complained one schoolgirl under the age of 18 becomes pregnant every three minutes , while 23 per cent of all births fall into the under - 18s category , according to the charities			1
@entity40 , 20 , a student who passed the mannequins , said : ' yes , it 's disturbing to see in a window			0
but it 's the truth			0
' you see pregnant girls all the time on the streets			2
so this forces you to think about the problem , does n't it ? ' but her friend @entity52 , 18 , disagreed , adding : ' i think it 's horrible , awful			2
if i was a mother , i would n't want my child to see that			0
' @entity1 's socialist government insists that education and children 's rights have improved greatly since it came to power 15 years ago			1
however charities and non-government organisations say that not enough is being done to educate children about sex , and that parents also need to take the issue more seriously			2
that is why charities @entity68 and @entity70 decided to launch their latest campaign , and say they are delighted with the controversy it has attracted			0
shock : one girl under the age of 18 becomes pregnant every three minutes in @entity1 , while a quarter of all births in the country fall into that age group , according to the charities @entity82 , president of @entity70 , said : ' it 's amazing seeing people react as they walk by			1
this is such a taboo subject in @entity1 , we want people to talk about it			2
' some people get angry and complain			0
' the mannequins will be on display for the next month and may be taken to other malls around the nation of 30million people			0
it comes days after a @entity97 women 's rights watchdog expressed ' deep concern ' over @entity1 's high number of teenage pregnancies and maternal mortality			1
according to the most recent @entity97 data , @entity1 had an adolescent birth rate of 101 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 , one of the highest in @entity106 , in 2010			1
for every 100,000 live births that took place , 92 women died in labour			0
the risks to adolescent mothers of death or serious injury is significantly higher than women in their late teens or twenties .			0
