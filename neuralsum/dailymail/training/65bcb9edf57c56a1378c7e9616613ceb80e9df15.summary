stranded in a field 20 miles from the sea , he was hardly likely to make a quick escape			1
yet the emergency services were taking no chances when they launched operation @entity6 yesterday			0
wearing helmets and armed with brooms , firemen tried to corner the bewildered grey seal that had been spotted flopping around the field by a dog walker			1
but they could only man some fencing panels and offer advice on how to go about the tricky task			0
judging by the seal ’s frightened expression , maybe a few more of them should have stayed behind at the station			1
in total around ten police officers , six firefighters and four wildlife rescue volunteers worked together to herd the lost seal on to a trailer in the field near @entity25 in @entity55			1
wildlife experts are baffled at how he managed to get himself lost in the middle of a field			2
he is thought to belong to an established colony on @entity61 in the @entity62 , from where he swam to the @entity64 and through a series of brooks to @entity67			0
there he may have become disoriented before making his way into the muddy field			2
‘ it is absolutely incredible that a seal has managed to get this far inland , ’ one resident said			2
‘ he just must have kept following each water course he came across			0
’ the mammal was flailing across the muddy field when local people discovered it this morning a local man jabs the mammal with a wooden brush as firefighters and police look on in a bid to keep it under control fire crews have been caught to winch the creature , which is expected to be sedated by a vet later today the animal was discovered by a dog walker in the rural setting early this morning , before police were called locals have described the seal as ' not very friendly ' and police are warning people to stay away nearby residents think the seal may have swam up a local brook , which runs into the @entity64 local people and emergency services were left baffled by the discovery of the seal some 20miles from the @entity64 and @entity101 @entity102 , who works at the nearby @entity103 , said the seal was ‘ quite large and not very friendly ’			1
volunteers transported the seal to the @entity106 wildlife centre at @entity107 , in @entity108 , @entity109 , where it underwent medical checks			0
the @entity106 is working on a plan to escort him back to his colony			0
police were the first called to the scene , but say their role is mainly one of ' crowd management ' members of the @entity120 , who usually deal with beached animals , are at the scene the nearest sea to the animal 's location is the estuary of the @entity64 in @entity127 - seven miles away			1

the seal was discovered some 20miles from the coast in a @entity55 field
firefighters , policemen and @entity136 officials were called to the scene
