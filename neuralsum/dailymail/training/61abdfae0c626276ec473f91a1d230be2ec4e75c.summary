by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 10:03 est , 13 august 2012 even the most casual of viewers of the @entity3 over the past two weeks could not have failed to spot the luminous yellow trainers that seemed to be worn by almost every athlete at the @entity6			0
the unmissable neon footwear dominated at the @entity3 track and field events - with the most high profile outing of all being the moment @entity12 sped to success in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres wearing the yellow spikes - amid a sea of fellow runners wearing identical pairs			1
in fact , an incredible tally of more than 400 athletes wore the brightly coloured trainers - meaning that barely an event went by without them making an appearance			1
a sea of yellow : almost all the athletes in the men 's 5,000 metres wore the @entity30 running shoes - including twice @entity3 champion @entity12 , front right gold standard : @entity12 speeds to victory in the 5,000m - adding to his 10,000m success earlier in the week of those 400 , 68 athletes won medals - including a gold tally of 25			1
the gold - standard kit in question was the high - tech @entity30 range - a collection of footwear designed especially for the @entity3 by @entity30			1
the collection covered footwear for athletes taking part in events on track , field and road , and a handful in boxing and fencing too			0
the trainers are tailored for each individual event , with 16 variations in total			0
sprinters chose from a selection of four different spikes , including the @entity63 , a shoe that fuses @entity30 's revolutionary @entity66 technology - a featherlight woven fabric that provides a dynamic , sock - like fit - with a lightweight spike plate			0
winning style : the high performance shoes are described as @entity30 's lightest , fastest spike ever @entity12 raced to gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m wearing the @entity74 , one of three spikes created especially for distance runners			1
@entity30 report that the @entity74 is the lightest , fastest 1,500m race spike they have ever made , combining what they describe as an ultra-responsive carbon plate with the dynamic @entity66 upper			0
for marathon runners , they created the @entity84 , an ultra-lightweight trainer ' knitted ' from single lengths of high - tech thread meaning no bulk , virtually no seams and no superfluous weight			1
the marathon shoe weighs just 5.6 ounces for a size 9 , and is engineered for a precision fit to create a feeling of a second skin for the endurance athletes for whom comfort is paramount			0
@entity30 say that the @entity84 conforms with their commitment to combining ' high performance with environmentally sustainable design ' , because the knitted part of the upper does not use cuts of multiple materials and sections found in traditional sports footwear , thus reducing waste in the manufacturing process			2
so not only are the @entity30 's bright yellow - they 're green too			0
the @entity110 collection is available at @entity30 stores now , priced Â£ 150 , while the volt sprint and distance spikes will be available to buy on 1 october price tbc			2
@entity12 's spikes : the @entity116 , set to go on sale in october enduring appeal : the @entity84 , as worn by the @entity30 - sponsored marathon runners speed demons : @entity121 high performance : the @entity123 for long - distance track events top of the line : @entity126 lightweight and virtually seam - free : the @entity128			2
