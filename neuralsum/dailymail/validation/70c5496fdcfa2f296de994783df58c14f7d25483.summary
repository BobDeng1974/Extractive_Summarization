he said : ' i really do n’t think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not			0
' specifically , @entity11 alleged that : the jury ruled against @entity11 on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount			1
two hours later , they emerged in favor of @entity8			1
the court requires a minimum of 9 - 3 votes to come to a conclusion			0
but initially , the verdict stated that four jurors supported @entity11 's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination			1
on the pivotal claim that @entity11 was fired for being female , ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor			1
they came to their conclusion after completing this question - and - answer document			0

however , @entity11 's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in @entity164 and @entity165			0
@entity11 testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was ' professional to enter into an affair with a married partner ? ' ' going back i would not have done it again , but i did n't think it was inappropriate at the time , ' @entity11 said			2

' because of social media and live reports , the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe ' while today ’s outcome is a disappointment , i take consolation in knowing that people really listened ' if we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities , things will not change ' hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone , including women and minorities ' to support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow , we need to show leadership today			1
