it 's one of the most popular phrases of the modern technological age used by just about every teenage girl in @entity7 civilisation			1
however , it seems the ' oh my @entity9 ' initialism @entity1 is actually very ' last century '			1
it dates back to 1917 when @entity13 admiral @entity12 first penned the expression in a letter to @entity16			1
@entity18 ' @entity17 , as he was known , had been writing about some ' utterly [ upsetting ] ' @entity20 newspaper headlines			1
a copy of the letter @entity13 admiral @entity12 sent to @entity16 in 1917 where he used the phrase ' @entity1 ' which has now become popular among teenagers he wrote : ' i hear that a new order of @entity28 is on the tapis — @entity1 ( oh ! my ! @entity9 ! ) — shower it on the @entity30 ! ! ' the phrase , added to the @entity32 in 2011 , is the colloquial shorthand for ' @entity1 ' , generally used in conversations to express surprise , embarrassment , excitement and disgust , according to the @entity39			1
it is normally associated with teenage girls and the phrase was thought to have originated from online chat rooms , most commonly used in online games , web chats and in text messages			2
it is frequently heard on reality tv shows too , including @entity49 is @entity50			2
@entity18 ' @entity17 ( left ) , as he was known , used it in a letter to the famous wartime prime minister about some ' utterly [ upsetting ] ' @entity20 newspaper headlines and indeed , it is a far cry from the upper - class world of @entity12 who was one of the most celebrated officers in the history of the @entity60			1
lord @entity12 began his career during the @entity62 and ended it during the @entity20			1
he is widely credited for materially preparing the fleet for war , introducing the world 's first all - big - gun battleship dreadnought			2
however , he resigned as @entity18 in 1915 after falling out with the then first lord @entity16 over the commitment to the @entity69 expedition			2
such is the power of writing in the digital age , typing on screen has become a major force in driving the evolution of language			2
expressions such as @entity1 and @entity77 are cropping up more frequently as actual speech , bringing with them added layers of meaning			1
never before has so much typed language migrated towards the spoken word rather than vice versa , according to the @entity85			2
for example , @entity77 ( pronounced as ' doll ' ) goes beyond the meaning of ' laughing out loud ' when it is spoken			1
it suggests a sense of belonging to a particular ' tribe ' - in this instance , the digitally savvy			2
and it builds on earlier web language spoken by those ' in the know ' , such as use of the term ' dot.com ' which has since passed into the mainstream			0
meanwhile , @entity77 - now defined as ' laughing out loud ' - was first used in the 1980s in bulletin board systems ( @entity102 ) , which were early forums where geeks gathered to talk about computing			1
it was first recorded around this time on @entity107 - a @entity102 established at the @entity108 and the neigbouring @entity109 more than a decade before the @entity110 was developed			1
all this is scant consolation for the millions of ' textlexic ' @entity13 who are unable to understand the abbreviations sent to them in phone messages			1
six in 10 adults admit they have received a message which left them baffled , thanks to the ever - growing dictionary of initials and phrases , according to research published last october			0
even people in powerful positions can become confused , as became clear when @entity123 told the @entity124 that he believed ' lol ' stood for ' lots of love '			0
a survey of 1,000 adults found that many were aware of ' lol ' and ' @entity130 ' , which means ' see you later '			0
many now use text shorthand in all forms of writing , from emails to status updates on websites such as @entity138			0
some over- 50s are slipping the odd ' btw ' ( ' by the way ' ) or ' imho ' ( ' in my humble opinion ' ) into their emails , the research for online security firm @entity139 showed			0
but four in 10 adults fear the practice has become so common that children are not learning how to write @entity150 correctly			0
text language , like using ' 4 ' instead of ' for ' or ' @entity1 ' for ' oh my @entity9 ' , developed when the earliest mobile phones only allowed 160 characters on a text			0
although that restriction no longer exists , @entity156 has a 140 - character limit and many use textspeak in all forms of written communication today as if it was a normal part of language			0
@entity139 boss @entity164 said : ' a quarter of the population tend to use text words rather than normal @entity150			0
' it shows the impact that texting and the mobile phone has had on society			0
the tendency to shorten words has stuck around			0
' given that 60 per cent have received a text that they did n't understand because it contained text speak , perhaps it is a worrying trend and a source of confusion and miscommunication			0
