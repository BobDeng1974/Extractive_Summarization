the two officers were called to @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12 , after a member of the public spotted the pair of legs sticking upside down in the ground			1
but when officers arrived they discovered the ' emergency ' was in fact a scarecrow			0
' emergency ' : pub landlord @entity22 , 60 , created the scarecrow , which was meant to be a man who had fallen down a molehill , for the local scarecrow competition pub landlord @entity22 , 60 , had created the scarecrow , which was meant to depict a man who had fallen down a molehill , for the local scarecrow competition which was raising money for charity			1
as well as the fake legs , mr @entity22 had also placed another molehill nearby with a giant mole sticking its head above the ground			1
mr @entity22 admitted police were not amused with the prank when they responded to the emergency call last sunday night			0
he said : ' our scarecrow was one of 14 made by villagers in @entity11 for a competition to raise money for a cancer charity			0
' it was a man fallen down a mole hole and a giant mole			2
' the first i knew about the police being called was when someone said there were two officers in the car park			0
they said someone had reported a man fallen down a hole			2
' mistake : police were called to reports of a man trapped upside down in a field after a member of the public spotted this scarecrow mr @entity22 said the officers were ' not in the mood for laughing ' and suggested he should move the scarecrow - which was placed near the pub car park overlooking the main road			1
a spokeswoman for @entity74 confirmed a member of the public had reported a man lying in a ditch outside the pub. she said no action would be taken but officers would speak to the publican			2
other entries in the village competition included a drunkard tied to a lamppost without his boots			0
but the winner was @entity90 - a mother - in - law with a broomstick being rescued from a high hedge by a fireman			0
molehill : as well as the fake legs , mr @entity22 had also placed another molehill nearby with a giant mole sticking its head above the ground			1

pub landlord @entity22 created the scarecrow in his pub garden for a competition
the scarecrow depicted a man who had fallen head - first down a molehill
officers were called after a member of the public spotted the legs ... mistaking the scarecrow for a *stricken* *punter*
