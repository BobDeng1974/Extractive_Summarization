by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:03 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 05:22 est , 24 october 2012 the taxpayer is paying child benefit to 40,000 children who do not live in @entity5 at a cost of up to £ 36million a year , @entity1 can reveal			1
the astonishing bill run up by almost 24,000 families emerged as @entity9 presses ahead with a scheme to cut child benefit for higher earners in the @entity5			1
the reforms are expected to save £ 1.5billion a year , but @entity15 @entity14 are demanding the chancellor end the payment to families overseas or risk an angry backlash from voters			1
@entity9 's plan to cut child benefit for higher rate taxpayers was already in trouble before today 's revelation that millions are being paid to families who do not live in the @entity5 under @entity30 rules , the benefit has to be paid to @entity32 nationals who are working in @entity5 and paying national insurance – even if their families are based abroad			1
according to figures unveiled in @entity37 yesterday , there were 23,855 families claiming for 40,251 children at the end of last month			1
two - thirds of the children ( 25,623 ) are based in @entity43			1
payments were also made for 2,529 children in @entity46 , 2,146 in @entity47 , 1,953 in @entity48 and 1,291 in @entity49			1
child benefit is paid at £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for every other child , regardless of parental income			0
but from january , parents who earn £ 50,000 or more will see their benefit cut			0
any family where one parent earns more than £ 60,000 will lose child benefit all together			0
yet households where two parents are working and earn just under £ 50,000 each will keep their child benefits – even though their combined income will be higher			0
the reforms have triggered fury from @entity15 backbenchers who say they penalise families with stay - at - home parents			1
cutting benefits for middle - class earners is expected to save £ 1.5billion a year			2
the @entity71 has refused to say how much international child benefits totalled , but @entity15 mp @entity73 , who uncovered the figures through parliamentary questions , estimated it was £ 36.6million			1
mrs @entity73 said : ‘ hard - pressed taxpayers will be appalled to see their pockets being pillaged to pay out millions of pounds in child benefit payments for children living in other parts of @entity32			1
‘ this is deeply unfair and demonstrates yet again that some @entity32 immigrants are using crazy @entity30 laws to get away with abusing our benefits system			0
‘ the government must get these loopholes closed to protect hard - pressed families			1
’ a @entity71 spokesman said : ‘ the payments can only be made while the parents are working in the @entity5 and paying @entity5 national insurance			1
' less than 0.5 per cent of child benefits payments are of this kind			0
’ families were due to receive letters setting out the changes to higher earners , but @entity99 could not find a simple way to explain them , so the letters have not been sent			2
@entity102 , @entity104 ’s shadow treasury minister , said : ‘ with just a few weeks until hundreds of thousands of parents lose every penny of their child benefit , it ’s becoming ever clearer that @entity109 and @entity9 simply have n’t thought this policy through			0
‘ and the chaotic way it is being implemented looks set to be yet another example of this government ’s incompetence			0
’ a @entity99 spokesman said : ‘ it is wrong to suggest we are behind with letting people know about the child benefit changes			0
our plans are firmly on course to contact affected taxpayers from next week			2
‘ the letters set out the options clearly so that an informed choice can be made in time for the january 7 rule change			2
’ @entity15 mp @entity73 said the payment of child benefit to families overseas was ' deeply unfair ' the proportion of people deemed too sick or disabled to work has almost trebled after changes to controversial @entity115 tests			1
figures released by the @entity136 yesterday reveal that 26 per cent of those tested for eligibility for @entity139 ( @entity139 ) in the first quarter of this year were considered to be too sick to work again			0
when the testing process was introduced at the end of 2008 , just 9 per cent were signed off as long - term sick			2
the testing process has been hugely controversial with disability campaigners , who claim it is biased against the sick			0
the @entity136 has changed the tests after losing thousands of appeals			0
the latest figures will be seen as vindication for those campaigning for reform of the tests			0
but they will also raise doubts about the government ’s ability to curb the huge bill for out - of - work benefits			2
of the 191,000 people who applied for @entity139 , 65,000 abandoned their claims before being tested and 44,000 are being assessed			2
some 44,000 were deemed fit to work , with 21,000 signed off as long - term sick , and 17,000 offered training to help get back to work .			0

millions of pounds sent to families who do not live in @entity5
two - thirds of claims are made for children in @entity43
