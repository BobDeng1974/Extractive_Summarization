@entity0 logged into @entity1 last month and described @entity2 as the ‘ next big @entity4 star ’			1
it turns out he might have sold him short			0
what happened on @entity7 on tuesday night — the demolition of @entity9 by a 19 - year - old wildcard — was quite remarkable in a global sense			1
he started with an ace and closed the show four sets later with another			2
in between there were a further 35 , and 70 winners from the world no 144			0
to be clear , @entity9 did not play badly			1
instead , this was about a fearless player with grass - court tools who never stopped going for the big shot			1
the surprise was that this @entity4 , who travels with an @entity54 and whose mother gave him no chance against @entity9 , sustained such levels against this particular man			1
@entity9 is the immovable object , an obdurate beast who chases all lost causes			1
not many players can wait out the temperamental storms of talent quite like the @entity66			1
and , it should not be forgotten , @entity9 was up to speed			2
he had a peculiar run to the fourth round , dropping the first set in his three previous matches			0
power : @entity9 fought with everything he had on @entity7 , but was beaten by the better man fan favourite : the @entity20 crowd were right behind the young @entity4 all game fan favourite : the @entity20 crowd were right behind the young @entity4 all game @entity81 stunning between the legs winner but every time he bounced back with devastating force , giving every indication that once again he would reach the final , as he has on the five occasions he has survived the third round			1
but along came @entity2 , the tradesman ’s son , with his rapid serve and those uninhibited groundstrokes			2
this was his first time on @entity7 , a man leading a charmed life having already been brought back from the dead by a @entity98 call when facing match point in the second round			2
everything he did was done with joy			0
when he was broken for the only time , in the second set , he smirked			0
when he pulled off the shot of the @entity106 — a winner played from between his legs , or a hotdog , if you prefer — at 3 - 3 in the second , he grinned for two minutes			0
he described his celebratory dance at the end as a ‘ juicy wiggle ’			0
his only frown came when he discussed his mother ’s lack of faith			0
‘ i just believed in myself and believed that i could create some opportunities , ’ he said			0
@entity2 ’s response , quite aside from providing the shock of the tournament , was to text his mother a smiley face			2
glum : @entity9 looks down as he reacts to the press after the defeat pressure : things just did n't go @entity9 's way on wednesday as the @entity131 champion crashed out from the start , he carried the confidence of someone with considerably more experience			1
while @entity9 ran from the coin toss to the baseline to begin his fidgety routine of tics and outfit adjustments , @entity2 sauntered			1
he waved to someone in the crowd			0
he opened with an ace and , as someone once touted as a professional basketball player , he walked the baseline bouncing the ball between his legs			0
he held to love and would lose only four points on his serve in the opening set , which he took on a tiebreak			0
the clinching shot ? an ace			0
for an hour and 32 minutes , @entity2 sustained the same extreme level without a single significant wobble			2
then , serving at 5 - 6 in the second , he cracked a little and fluffed two straight - forward volleys for 0 - 30			1
he fought his way back into the game , surviving a set point , but at the second opportunity @entity9 took it when @entity2 hit into the net			1
that should have been that			0
that should have been @entity167 ’s cue to leave politely , as @entity9 ’s previous three opponents had			2
feeling the heat : @entity9 came up against an inspired opponent as the teenager triumphed instead , he won the third set on a tiebreak and broke @entity174 to lead 3 - 1 in the fourth			1
that became 5 - 3 and the magnitude of the occasion hit @entity2			1
‘ you know if you believe in yourself you ’re going to have a pretty good shot to close out a match , ’ he said			0
he did just that , with his 37th ace of an extraordinary contest			0
@entity2 , like many players his age , grew up idolising @entity187			2
he had the fortune of practising with him at the @entity131 — now he might face him in the @entity20 semi-finals			2
for @entity9 , there was a trace of uncharacteristic bitterness in his muted praise for a teenager who played in the juniors last year and was on the @entity197 tour as recently as two weeks ago			1
‘ everything is a little bit easier when you are arriving , ’ said @entity9 , who lost to @entity198 in the first round last year and to @entity200 in the second round the year before			1
‘ you have nothing to lose			0
’ now @entity2 has everything to gain with a quarter - final on wednesday against @entity208 , who until now held an advantage over him in the ‘ next big thing ’ stakes			1
both men are widely deemed to be behind @entity213 in that pecking order , but who knows ?			0

@entity217 1 defeated in four sets by 19 - year - old @entity2
@entity4 seals 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) , 5 - 7 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) , 6 - 4 victory on @entity7
he will play @entity208 in the quarter - finals on wednesday
@entity9 has n't produced best form at @entity20 this year
the @entity66 is first no 1 to be knocked out in @entity46 by player outside to top 100 since 1992
