by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 is to join the rest of the @entity4 by agreeing to legalise gay marriage later this week			0
the @entity7 ’s 128 @entity6 will disregard massive opposition to the radical plan by voting on wednesday to allow same - sex couples to marry			1
the issue has already humiliated @entity12 , with 133 of his @entity14 mps trying voting against the proposals in the @entity16 earlier this year			0
controversial : politicians in @entity2 are disregarding public opposition by backing same - sex marriage now @entity2 ’s first minister @entity20 – a passionate champion of same - sex marriage - will also face a rebellion on the issue , with one of his ministers revealing he will vote against the plans , as well as a clutch of @entity29 backbenchers			1
but a survey of all @entity31 has revealed that an overwhelming majority of @entity6 will back the proposals when they vote on the issue for the first time on wednesday evening			1
although the @entity35 will then be subject to additional revision by a parliamentary committee before a final vote at some point next year , securing approval ‘ in principle ’ is likely to end any doubts about the legislation being passed			1
opponents of the legislation will then start to focus on campaigning for appropriate safeguards to be put in place to protect the rights of people who refuse to promote same - sex marriage and ensure that no individual celebrant is forced to hold gay ceremonies against their will			1
our survey reveals that 86 @entity6 have confirmed they will vote for same - sex marriage , while 11 plan to vote against			1
however , the rebellion against the move could grow in the coming days , as ten @entity6 say they remain undecided and a further 20 have refused to reveal how they will vote on the issue			1
leader : first minister @entity20 is one of the @entity6 said to be voting in favour of gay marriage the decision to press ahead with the move comes despite the @entity67 ’s biggest ever public consultation revealing that more than two - thirds of respondents opposed the plan			1
the issue has led to considerable tension within the @entity29			0
four nationalist msps say they will definitely vote against the move – including @entity75 , the minister for learning , sciences and @entity2 ’s languages , as well as backbenchers @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
mr @entity75 , who represents the @entity83 and is a former senior media relations officer at the @entity85 , said hundreds of his constituents have been in touch to urge him to back the ‘ traditional definition of marriage ’			0
he said : ‘ in responding to people , i have pointed out that i am supportive of the existing rights of same - sex couples to civil partnerships , and that i welcome the belated respect which society rightly gives gay people , but that i believe difficult issues are raised around the specific question of marriage			1
this view has also been informed by the strength of feeling which exists among many people in the islands			0
‘ among all these different views , the view which so many of my constituents have expressed to me has a right to be recorded , and for that reason it is my intention to vote against the @entity35			2
’ the @entity112 survey is the most detailed research ever carried out into the views of @entity2 ’s msps on same - sex marriage			2
as all @entity6 will be allowed to vote on the issue as a ‘ matter of conscience ’ – without being told how to vote by party whips – the result is less predictable than on most issues in the @entity2 parliament , where the @entity29 has a majority and is normally able to confidently press through its opposition			2
split : the @entity2 conservatives were the only party to have more msps opposed to the legislation , which is embarrassing to @entity130 , the party 's openly gay leader who has been a prominent supporter the @entity2 conservatives were the only party to have more msps opposed to the legislation than supportive of it – with six saying they will vote against the @entity35 and just four saying they will vote for it			1
that is embarrassing for @entity130 , the party ’s leader , who has been one of the most prominent supporters of the legislation at @entity141			1
the @entity67 is committed to a @entity2 that is fair and equal and that is why we believe that same sex couples who wish should be allowed to marry as soon as possible @entity146 but miss @entity130 said : ‘ i believe the forthcoming bill on same sex marriage is an issue of conscience , which is why i have given @entity152 msps a free vote on the issue			2
‘ i support same sex marriage and will be voting to pass this bill			2
’ the four @entity29 members who have said they will vote against the plans are expected to be joined by more rebels on wednesday , with four nationalist @entity6 saying they remain undecided and a further ten saying they wo n’t reveal their view before voting later this week			1
former @entity29 leader @entity159 believes that pressing ahead with the legislation will cost the party votes in future elections – and urged @entity6 to ensure they get proper protection for religious groups who do n’t want to hold same - sex marriages			1
he said : ‘ @entity168 assurances will not necessarily deal with the realities of supervision of the legislation by the courts			2
‘ there ’s a majority for it but once you get the principle what then happens is it ’s about “ on what terms ” ? like any insurance policy , it ’s about the small print – look at what the small print says			0
that ’s my advice to @entity6 – even if you ’re in favour , look at the small print and what might happen because the courts are outwith your control			0
’ following wednesday ’s vote , the @entity191 will then return to @entity141 ’s equal opportunities committee , which will consider any amendments which need to be made			1
it remains on track to be passed in time to allow the first gay weddings to take place in 2015			0
opponents of same - sex marriage want more to be done to ensure that those who continue to believe in traditional marriage do not suffer discrimination in their career or have freedom of speech restricted			2
they fear that some professionals , such as teachers , could be sacked if they fail to promote gay marriage			0
freedom : msps will be allowed to vote as a ' matter of conscience ' when they cast their ballots at @entity141 a spokesman for the @entity2 for marriage pressure group , which includes representatives of the @entity216 in @entity2 and @entity217 , said : ‘ the @entity67 ’s promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow			1
real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of @entity2 who do n’t support this law			2
’ among those set to vote against the @entity35 is @entity14 msp @entity229 , a member of the @entity7 ’s equal opportunities committee			0
he said : ‘ there ’s been a substantial trend in recent years away from supporting traditional marriage as a basis for the raising of children and providing the cornerstone for society as a whole			0
‘ at a time when we should have been looking for ways to underpin and reinforce marriage on that basis we seem to be obsessed with pursuing what i believe is an unjustified desire to provide same - sex marriage , so i think it is a step in the wrong direction as far as the support of marriage in society is concerned			0
’ however , @entity2 @entity14 deputy leader @entity251 said he would support the @entity35 – while ensuring that any amendments can provide full protection to religions , faiths and congregations which do n’t want to take part			0
@entity258 , @entity259 for @entity260 and @entity261 , said : ‘ i do n’t think the case for making it different for gay people holds much water : everyone should be equal			0
‘ i ’m concerned about the people who are against but if you are a parliamentarian you have to deal with hard facts and logic on whether something should become law and it is hard to take into account religious views on that basis			0
’ a @entity67 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity67 is committed to a @entity2 that is fair and equal and that is why we believe that same sex couples who wish should be allowed to marry as soon as possible			0
