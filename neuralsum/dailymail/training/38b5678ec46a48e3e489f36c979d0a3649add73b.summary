by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 08:12 est , 8 october 2013 scientists believe a gene involved in the regulation of the ' happy hormone ' serotonin may predict a happy marriage some say the secret to a happy marriage is compromise , or to never go to bed on an argument			1
but @entity12 psychologists now declared that the key to wedded bliss may actually be in our dna			2
they believe a gene involved in the regulation of the ' happy hormone ' serotonin can predict how much our emotions affect our relationships			1
the study , from the @entity23 , and @entity24 , may be the first to link genetics , emotions , and marital satisfaction , the researchers say			2
senior author of the study , @entity23 psychologist @entity28 , said : ' an enduring mystery is , what makes one spouse so attuned to the emotional climate in a marriage , and another so oblivious ? ' ' with these new genetic findings , we now understand much more about what determines just how important emotions are for different people			0
' specifically , researchers found a link between relationship fulfillment and a gene variant , or ' allele ' , known as 5 - @entity44			1
all humans inherit a copy of this gene variant from each parent			1
study participants with two short 5 - @entity44 alleles were found to be most unhappy in their marriages when there was a lot of negative emotion , such as anger and contempt , and most happy when there was positive emotion , such as humour and affection			1
by contrast , those with one or two long alleles were far less bothered by the emotional tenor of their marriages			2
' we are always trying to understand the recipe for a good relationship , and emotion keeps coming up as an important ingredient , ' said @entity28 , who heads up a study that has tracked over 150 married couples for more than 20 years			0
the new findings do n't mean that couples with different variations of @entity76 are incompatible , the researchers note			0
instead , it suggests that those with two short alleles are likelier to thrive in a good relationship and suffer in a bad one			0
the results of the study , which looked at the genotypes of more than 100 spouses and observed how they interacted with their partners over time , bore this out , they said			0
' individuals with two short alleles of the gene variant may be like hothouse flowers , blossoming in a marriage when the emotional climate is good and withering when it is bad , ' said @entity96 of @entity24 and lead author of the study			1
the researchers found a link between relationship fulfilment and gene variant called 5 - @entity44			1
couples who both had a short 5 - @entity44 had the most unhappy marriages - whereas those with one or two long variants were less bothered by the emotional ups and downs of their marriages ' conversely , people with one or two long alleles are less sensitive to the emotional climate			1
' ' neither of these genetic variants is inherently good or bad , ' she added			0
' each has its advantages and disadvantages			0
' participants in the study belong to a group of 156 middle - aged and older couples whose relationships @entity28 and fellow researchers have followed since 1989			2
for this study , participants provided dna samples , and researchers matched their genotypes with their levels of marital satisfaction and the emotional tenor of their interactions in the lab setting			0
for spouses with two short 5 - @entity44 alleles , who made up 17 percent of the spouses studied , researchers found a strong correlation between the emotional tone of their conversations and how they felt about their marriage			1
for the 83 percent of spouses with one or two long alleles , on the other hand , the emotional quality of their discussions bore little or no relation to their marital satisfaction over the next decade			0
the study is published online in the journal @entity147 .			0
