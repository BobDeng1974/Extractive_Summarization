four in ten children lack the basic skills needed to be ready for school at the age of five , new figures revealed yesterday			1
more than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education after falling short of development targets in early reading , writing and physical skills			1
boys have fallen significantly behind girls by the age of five , with only 52 per cent considered to have reached a ‘ good level of development ’			1
the figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘ must do more ’ to help toddlers learn			1
despite improvements in most parts of the country since last year , childcare minister @entity36 insisted that ‘ too few young children are ready for school ’			2
the figures show that just 59 per cent of boys can write a simple sentence or a letter to @entity46 at the age of five against three - quarters of girls			1
just 68 per cent of boys can read simple sentences compared with 80 per cent of their female classmates			1
commenting on the figures , mr @entity36 said : ‘ we know the first few years of a child ’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond			2
‘ the statistics published today clearly show that some progress is being made but more must be done to ensure children , especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds , are put on the right path			0
‘ parents need to be confident that while their children are out of their care , they ’re not only safe , happy and having fun but at the same time developing important skills like playing confidently with their friends , speaking and understanding words , letters and numbers			0
‘ the government has provided new funding through the @entity77 and strengthened qualifications to raise standards			0
it ’s now up to those who support our children to ensure they get the start in life they deserve – something parents and i both want to see			0
’ the figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘ must do more ’ to help toddlers learn under a ‘ nappy curriculum ’ for children aged from birth to five , teachers observe youngsters in their care and judge how well they are doing against 17 scales			1
they are judged to have reached a ‘ good level of development ’ if they can show they are attentive in class , can follow detailed instructions , use tenses when speaking and show good control and co-ordination when making large and small movements			0
they must also use the toilet and dress independently , be confident to try new activities , know that some behaviour is unacceptable and take turns with others when playing			0
in literacy and numeracy , they should be able to read and write simple sentences , count to 20 and use everyday language to talk about size and weight			1
the curriculum is meant to prepare youngsters to start compulsory schooling at age five and is followed by primary school reception classes , nurseries and childminders			0
but some critics have claimed that formal learning is being imposed on children too soon			2
there are particular concerns that the education system is failing to properly cater for boys , for example through shortages of male teachers			0
yesterday ’s figures – from the @entity145 - show 60 per cent of five - year - olds were judged to have reached a ‘ good ’ levels of development this summer - up from 52 per cent last year			1
it means some 258,000 youngsters will start @entity151 lacking some of the skills needed to cope with the demands of schooling			0
while boys narrowed the gap slightly in some areas , they still lagged behind girls , particularly in reading and writing			2
courtesy of @entity161 professor sir @entity162 , director of @entity164 ’s @entity163 , said the quality of parenting and the amount of time adults spent interacting with children was critical to their development the narrowest gap was in the use of technology , where 91 per cent of girls had a good level of understanding , against 89 per cent of boys			1
researchers from @entity164 ’s @entity163 warned last month that too many children were being left damaged by early parenting which lacked cuddles and conversation			2
@entity185 had some of the worst levels of development among children in the western world , it was claimed			1
professor sir @entity162 , director of the institute , said the quality of parenting and the amount of time adults spent interacting with children was critical to their development			2
‘ of course , some children will do better than others because it ’s in their genes or things of that nature but we know the quality of parenting is crucial , ’ he said			0
‘ we know input from parents or other carers on talking to children or reading to children , playing with children , singing with children and warmth - emotion , cuddling , loving - are all vital to children ’s development			2
’ he said poor performance was also closely linked to levels of deprivation and the quality of services to support children and their parents before they start school			0
commenting on the latest figures , @entity223 , chief executive of the @entity224 , representing thousands of early years providers , said : ‘ we are extremely disappointed that the minister has used these results , which show a marked improvement in outcomes across all areas of development , to direct unfair criticism at the early years sector			1
‘ childcare professionals continue to do remarkable work in the face of inadequate funding and extremely limited practical support			0
recent sector initiatives rolled - out by the @entity145 – such as the early years pupil premium – while positive in theory , will do little to address these challenges in practice , largely because the government refuses to acknowledge the severity of the current problem			0
