@entity0 , who has @entity1 's , has has been in and out of hospital since age 12 @entity0 has had more unappetising hospital meals than he cares to remember			1
since the age of 12 , the 45 - year - old businessman has been in and out of hospital with @entity1 's disease - inflammation of the gut - and has often found the meals given to him inedible			0
so when he was asked if he would like to be an official food inspector for @entity12 , where he has been treated many times , he jumped at the chance			1
' i thought this was finally my opportunity to make changes happen and to help make the food better for patients , ' says @entity0 , who lives in @entity22 , @entity23			1
yet the experience has left him even more despairing			0
@entity0 was one of a team of six - at least half were members of the public , the rest trust staff - assessing the service on a number of criteria , including whether patients had a suitable space to eat their meal ; whether the food was served at the right temperature ; what it tasted like ; and what the patients thought of it			1
the results were to be used for a @entity42 of the @entity43 , or @entity44			1
these were introduced by the @entity46 in 2013 to help rank hospitals in @entity48 - the results are put on the @entity50 website , so that patients can make informed decisions about where to be treated			1
each trust has a team that collates the assessment for the trust - at least half of the team must be members of the general public , and the remainder can be hospital staff			1
but can these assessments be trusted ? the food @entity0 witnessed being served to patients was - in his words - ' diabolical in terms of taste , service and organisation '			1
' there was a ghastly mashed potato that was lumpy and inedible , ' he says			0
' and a vegetable soup that i can still remember very clearly			0
it was like dishwater - it tasted dire , with no flavour whatsoever			0
' after his inspection in 2013 , @entity0 filled in his questionnaire with resoundingly critical views on what he 'd seen			1
yet when the @entity44 assessment was published , @entity0 found out that the trust had been awarded 78.06 per cent for its food and how it was served			1
he was asked if he would like to be an official food inspector for @entity12 ' i was flabbergasted , ' he says			1
' judging by what i saw and experienced of the food on those inspections , they should n't have got more than about 5 per cent			1
' but it was n't just the food that bothered @entity0 on his tour of the wards			1
many of the meals were served by two people , working down a ward of 30 beds			0
' by the time the food got to the last patient , it would be stone - cold and inedible , ' he says			1
' there would be other instances where the food would be put next to the patient , where they could n't quite reach it			1
but because the nurse was so busy , the meal would just go to waste			0
we saw very high levels of food left on plates			2
' his concerns about the rating tally with the results of a recent survey of 850 patients at the very same trust			1
this was conducted by the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , the independent regulator of health and social care services in @entity48			0
the results revealed a rather different picture from the high score given by the place			2
the @entity124 patient survey rated the food just 5.2 out of ten for how ' good ' it was ( for choice of food , the score was higher , at 8.9 out of ten )			2
and there is a similar disparity across the country , according to research by the @entity138 , run by the charity sustain			0
it compared the results of the place ratings of ten trusts with their @entity124 patient surveys			2
according to their analysis , the average place rating for food was 92.99 per cent , compared with an average of 56 per cent of patients polled by the regulator saying the food was ' good '			1
the campaign believes that the @entity44 assessments should be handed to an independent body			0
' an approval rating of 92.99 per cent does appear to be ludicrously high and does not correlate with other evidence , which suggests patients are unhappy with what they are being served in hospital , ' says @entity161 , who heads the campaign			2
it was n't just the food that bothered him - many of the meals for 30 were served by just two people there is no doubt hospital food is a major concern			2
when the @entity173 highlighted the problems recently , readers overwhelmed us with photographs of appalling meals they had been given as patients in @entity46 hospitals			0
many also pointed out that serving such food is no way to help sick and vulnerable people to get better			2
last month , a survey by @entity184 of more than 1,550 @entity46 patients and visitors found that 43 per cent said the meals were not tasty , and 62 per cent said they should be more nutritious			2
to help ensure a healthy diet for patients and staff , the @entity46 announced that , from this april , it is bringing in new food standards in @entity48 to be enforced through legally binding contracts			2
among the new requirements , trusts must offer fish twice a week and use seasonal produce			0
data from @entity44 inspections will be used to help monitor these standards			0
this worries mr @entity161 - not least because the way the @entity44 results are actually compiled is ' complicated and unclear '			2
part of the problem , he believes , is that the trusts are managing their own inspections			0
' they only have to publish a rating out of 100 per cent , and it 's not clear who was on the inspection or what the team actually reported , ' he says			1
' the results are not reflecting what patients are saying to us , which is that the food is bad			1
for @entity0 , the experience has been frustrating ' moreover , the actual quality of the food itself only represents a small part of the place inspections , yet the results for the food are wrapped up in a score that includes , for example , whether napkins are provided with the patient 's meal			1
' this means that the government is using dodgy results to substantiate what it says it 's doing to improve food			1
' in response to criticism that the campaign has n't compared like - for - like data , mr @entity161 points out that ' patients will nonetheless look at these high scores and assume it means a glowing assessment of the food '			2
for @entity248 , the experience has been very frustrating			0
' after the inspection , along with the other team members , we sat down with staff at the hospital and gave them feedback , ' he says			0
' i was part of discussions about how they could change the food , and introduce a menu for those long - term patients who have to keep coming back to hospital			0
the staff were receptive , but i 've since been back to hospital as a patient - and nothing has changed			0
' @entity265 , the @entity44 coordinator for the @entity267 trust , points out that its latest results scored 89.06 per cent for the food			1
she says : ' we are encouraged by this result , and continue to work closely with our patients and nutritional teams to improve the food we provide for our patients			0
' the @entity277 says : ' patients deserve healthy , nutritious food when they are in hospital and that 's why we 've brought in compulsory standards in the terms of hospital contracts to ensure they get it			0
' the next set of @entity44 data , to be published in august , will be based on a more detailed assessment of the food			0
it will also include ratings such as choice at breakfast and whether fresh fruit is available .			0

@entity0 said food ' taste , service and organisation was diabolical '
he was one of a team of 6 assessing @entity303
results were used for a @entity42 of the @entity43
flabbergasted to see trust had been awarded 78.06 per cent for its food
