thirteen months on and @entity0 admits he did not see it coming			1
he was talking about his sacking in december 2013 , the bottom line of a late - night training - ground conversation after @entity4 had been beaten in @entity6			1
but the @entity9 manager ’s words would have been equally applicable to @entity6 , a low - to - mid - table team in the @entity11 then , but now in a dreadful , cost - cutting freefall			1
@entity13 opened the scoring for the hosts but they now have only a mediocre @entity17 campaign to consider after @entity18 and @entity19 hit back with goals for @entity9			1
@entity0 watches on as his @entity9 side came from behind to beat @entity6 in the @entity22 @entity18 ( right ) equalised for @entity0 's @entity9 team with a brilliant free kick striker @entity19 ( left ) scored the winning goal for @entity9 to get to round five of the @entity22 @entity6 were so poor that their manager @entity26 admitted that if he was a fan he would have walked out			1
@entity0 , though , has no such desire			2
he was a year out of management after leaving @entity4 but three wins in seven games since taking over a struggling club have them moving in the right direction			1
‘ i do n’t think when i get back to the training ground that the chairman will be waiting for me , ’ he said after this win			0
‘ but then i did n’t think i ’d get sacked last time			2
’ with @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 all out , @entity0 , a cup - winner as a player and coach with @entity40 , added : ‘ i think everyone will be thinking it has opened a little			2
’ @entity26 ’s concerns are deeper			0
on saturday , @entity46 was sold to @entity47 and @entity48 released			0
‘ one or two more ’ will follow this week , according to @entity26 , who must cut the wage bill			0
@entity26 admitted after the game that his team 's performance was short of what is expected @entity13 ( second left ) put @entity6 ahead but @entity26 is concerned he could leave the club he said he has been given no indication that he will lose @entity13 , the club ’s top earner and goalscorer with 12 in all competitions			2
‘ if an enormous offer came in then that would be left with the owner and chief executive , said @entity26			0
‘ i ’d like him here			0
at this stage there is no kind of mandate to lose @entity13			0

@entity0 was sacked as @entity4 boss after losing to @entity6
he is now manager at @entity17 club @entity9
