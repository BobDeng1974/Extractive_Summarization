@entity0 made it six goals in eight starts as @entity4 kept up their pursuit of @entity6 at the top of @entity8 with a 4 - 2 win over @entity10			1
@entity0 is currently scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of @entity13 who nets once every 81 minutes			1
the @entity15 loanee put his team in the @entity18 semi-finals in midweek with the winner against @entity21 and in @entity22 on sunday night he scored twice to keep @entity4 in the title race			2
and if his goal at the @entity26 was a tired shot with the goal gaping in the dying minutes , his strikes against @entity10 were of the highest quality and will only serve to ramp up the auction for his services at the end of the season – who knows if his goals bring trophies to the @entity37 , @entity4 might even be in the race to sign him permanently			1
@entity0 scored two more important goals for @entity4 as they look to keep up with @entity6 in the quest for the @entity8 crown @entity4 midfielder @entity42 ( right ) celebrates his equalising goal against @entity10 with with team - mate @entity44 ( right ) it 's been a week to remember for the @entity46 , who currently has a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of @entity6 's @entity13 the 26 - year - old slots the ball through the legs of the onrushing @entity10 goalkeeper @entity52 @entity0 ( no 14 ) now has six goals in eight starts for @entity4 and has impressed in the absence of regular striker @entity56 @entity15 loanee @entity0 salutes the fans after scoring @entity4 's second and putting his side ahead for the first time at @entity61 @entity62 international midfielder @entity44 celebrates his strike and the visitors third goal with @entity0 ( left ) the @entity4 players surround striker @entity0 ( no 14 ) after his first goal brought @entity69 's men back into the lead the game was the perfect tonic for anyone who had sat through @entity74 v @entity75 earlier on sunday			1
both sides flew forward from the off and their ambition was rewarded though for @entity4 the reward was ultimately far greater			2
they fell behind after nine minutes when former @entity6 player @entity81 took advantage of poor @entity4 defending			1
@entity83 lost his boot and was reduced to running back towards goal with it in his hand			0
and without him @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 all failed to stop @entity81 as he tricked his way in from the left - hand channel and shot past @entity94			0
@entity4 responded on the quarter - hour when @entity96 crossed from the right			0
the ball was cleared straight to @entity42 who picked his spot well to fire @entity4 level with his second goal of the season			1
on 24 minutes @entity4 were ahead and it was man of the moment in the @entity106 capital @entity0 who got the goal			1
@entity44 was involed in the build - up but he still had plenty to do when he received the ball cutting in from the right to shoot past @entity52			0
@entity10 , hoping to do their former coach @entity113 a big favour , did not retreat and they were level on the half hour when 19 - year - old @entity117 raced away from @entity4 ’s defence on to a pass from @entity120			2
the teenager scored from the rebound after his first shot came back off the post			0
@entity4 defender @entity83 loses his boot as he chases back during the build up to @entity81 's opener for @entity10 double goal scorer on the night @entity0 ( right ) tries to round a diving @entity10 goalkeeper @entity52 ( left ) @entity130 forward @entity96 ( left ) fights for the ball against @entity10 's @entity133 but was unable to add to his impressive tally the game was chaotic in every sense and @entity83 and @entity137 both needed lengthy treatment after a clash of heads			1
@entity96 was linking well with @entity44 and @entity0 and almost put real ahead but saw his shot come back off the post after another fine pass from @entity0			1
when the goal that put @entity4 ahead did come it was again made by @entity96			2
he played in @entity44 and his deflected shot beat @entity52 to leave @entity10 going down the tunnel at half time stunned to have played so well in attack and yet still find themselves behind			2
their front three of @entity155 , journeyman centre - forward @entity137 and teenage prospect @entity152 , aided by @entity120 , had run @entity4 ’s back four ragged and they kept the pressure up in the second half			0
it was @entity120 who wend down under a challenge from behind from @entity42 at the start of the second half but the referee was unmoved by the home side ’s appeals			1
@entity166 went close for @entity4 and then @entity96 raced away on another counter-attack , which ended with a pass to @entity0 , he tried to hit the shot first time and , falling as he made contact , blasted it high and wide			2
he would get another chance however and this time he would take it			0
@entity10 were playing football that made a mockery of the financial gulf between the two sides			0
their wage bill is € 12m compared with the € 17m @entity179 but they were inevitable leaving themselves wide open on the counter and they were also tiring badly			0
it was perhaps the fatigue that meant they allowed @entity83 to bring the ball out from the back without a @entity10 player anywhere near him			0
@entity83 picked out @entity0 with a long pass forward and he controlled it with his first touch before slotting past @entity52 with an emphatic second			0
a week ago he was a frustrated squad player			0
now with the season approaching its climax he looks like one of @entity4 's most important players .			1

@entity0 scored twice to keep @entity4 in touching distance of @entity8 leaders @entity6
@entity0 is scoring a goal every 83 minutes with a scoring ratio that is only two minutes short of @entity13
@entity4 went a goal down in the opening minutes following a *surprise* goal from @entity10 's @entity81
@entity42 equalised for the visitors and @entity0 doubled @entity4 's scoring with a goal in the 24th minute
although the home side levelled four minutes later the tie was put to bed after goals from @entity44 and another from @entity0
