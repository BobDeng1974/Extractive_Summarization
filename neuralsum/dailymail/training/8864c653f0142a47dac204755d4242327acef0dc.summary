fluid feast : the liquid lunch , above , contains turkey gel , umami - rich gravy , carrot fluid gel , dehydrated @entity6 sprouts and potato - infused foam for most of us , @entity8 is a time to ditch the diet			1
but jockeys have to forego all festive treats to stay light enough for winter races			1
so food scientist dr @entity15 and bookmakers @entity16 have now created the first ever liquid @entity8 lunch – containing just 294 calories – for riders in the @entity21 at @entity22 this weekend			1
the high - tech fluid festive feast contains turkey gel , umami - rich gravy , carrot fluid gel , dehydrated @entity6 sprouts , potato - infused foam and cranberry ' air '			1
and it is served with an espresso - style shot of mince pie extract and a spoonful of powdered brandy butter – an extra 38 calories			0
unlike the rest of us , jockeys are n’t able to get stuck into the classic 7,000 plus calorie @entity8 dinner			1
the drink is a balanced , high carbohydrate , low glycaemic load meal which provides all the nutrition needed for a jockey to remain light , yet full of energy and sharply focused before a big race			0
@entity46 at @entity16 said : ' @entity8 is a time when we all want to let ourselves go and enjoy all the different foods on offer but the top jockeys ca n't do that			0
' typically jockeys trying to make weight will eat a restricted calorie diet in the run up to a big race , so the traditional @entity8 lunch was most definitely off the menu for those racing at the @entity21			2
' the usual festive fare for jockeys riding on @entity61 would be a slither of turkey , a couple of sprouts and a few water biscuits			2
' even then they will probably spend a couple of hours on race day in the sauna sweating off those last few pounds ! ' champion jockey @entity71 who will be riding at the @entity21 at @entity22 on @entity61 added : ' this is a great invention for jockeys who are struggling to make weight for the @entity16 @entity75 but still want to feel part of their family 's festive celebrations			0
' i always used to feel a bit left out when they all started tucking in to their turkey so this year i am looking forward to enjoying the full flavours of @entity8 lunch , without having to worry about the calories			2
' treat : the meal is served with an espresso - style shot of mince pie extract and a spoonful of powdered brandy butter ( pictured ) – an extra 38 calories			0
