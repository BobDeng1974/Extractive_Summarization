by @entity0 since @entity3 's @entity2 abdicated his throne , all eyes have been on the country 's most glamorous new @entity6 - @entity5			0
the 41 - year - old , who is married to @entity9 , has earned her spot as one of the world 's most stylish royals thanks to her impeccable wardrobe choices - and she 's even managed to knock the once favoured @entity15 from her top spot			2
and it 's not just in the sartorial stakes that @entity6 @entity19 is reigning			2
one gem hunter says that while both brunettes are fashion icons who hail from a middle - class background , the similarities end when it comes to the biggest indulgence of royal life - jewellery			0
spot the difference : a gem expert says that the @entity31 of @entity32 , left , and @entity6 @entity19 's jewellery reveals that their choices are telling of huge personal and cultural differences between the two kings and queens have always showcased their status with the help of a jewel or two			2
@entity41 , gem hunter and founder of the @entity43 , believes our modern royals should continue this tradition			0
casting his expert eye over @entity15 and @entity19 ’s sparkly accessories , @entity41 reveals that their jewellery choices are telling of huge personal and cultural differences between the two			1
he said : ' as stunning women who can afford to inject colour into her jewellery , @entity19 confidently embraces vibrancy and variety , whereas @entity15 is rarely without her conventional pearls or diamonds			1
' in fact , the @entity3 royal family combine colour and drama in a way that seems alien to the more conservative @entity15			2
simple versus extravagant : @entity62 is looking very much the @entity63 , assuming a more traditional style than her adventurous counterpart , right , who lets her jewels take centre stage ' an outsider would be forgiven for mistaking @entity15 as the princess enduring @entity3 ’s current economic crisis - the absence of a statement necklace is more credit crunch than royal lunch			1
@entity19 shows us how to pair a tiara with vibrant magenta gems in the true style of a queen			1
' undoubtedly the best - known item in @entity15 's jewellery collection is her engagement ring , which once belonged to princess @entity83			0
the blue sapphire , which sparkles with 14 diamonds , was bought at the former @entity86 of @entity87 for a staggering £ 28,500			0
when it comes to choosing her own accessories , @entity15 does , however , prefer more simple pieces like her £ 1,090 @entity92 earrings and more modest £ 275 links hope earrings			1
she 's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery which she snapped up from made in @entity99 star @entity98 's myflashtrash website , which she wore while on her @entity102 tour of the @entity103			0
wearing it with confidence : he believes that @entity6 @entity19 wears her jewellery with the confidence gained during her colourful career as a journalist and her smile is as gleaming as her emeralds and showcases @entity3 vitality to the world queen @entity19 , however , is hardly ever spotted without her @entity116 diamond bracelet , which can cost in excess of £ 25,000 , as well as her favourite @entity119 ring , which can cost around £ 10,000			1
@entity41 goes on to explain that @entity19 lets her jewels take centre stage whilst @entity15 is keen not to shock , adding that @entity19 ’s fashion forward choice of gemstones in daring shades , worn with the confidence gained during her colourful career as a journalist , is a ' breath of fresh air '			1
@entity62 , meanwhile , is very much the @entity63 , assuming a more traditional style than her adventurous counterpart , he says			1
cheap and chic : @entity98 and her team were thrilled to discover that @entity15 was a keen supporter of @entity134 jewellery the collection : @entity15 bought the £ 86 @entity136 and £ 420 @entity137 and a @entity138 from @entity139 on @entity98 's website ' as both royals adopt a fairy - tale princess guise , the most important match in @entity3 vs. @entity145 history has a clear winner			0
' @entity15 ’s most decadent display to date captures the zeitgeist of the @entity134 monarchy , and underlines her position as a queen in waiting			2
yet , she misses her opportunity to truly assume her role as the modern day princess , plumping for colourless , conservative diamonds instead of adding a pop of colour to her outfit			0
' @entity19 ’s smile , however , is as gleaming as her emeralds and showcases @entity3 vitality to the world			0
