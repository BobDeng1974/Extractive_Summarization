they are desperate , defiant – and determined to get to @entity1			2
many had scaled mountains , crossed deserts and sailed across an ocean to get here			2
some of their companions had drowned , perished from starvation or been arrested before they made it			2
this is the latest illegal encampment to spring up in @entity13 – and hundreds are currently waiting for the first chance to escape			1
they have nicknamed it @entity33 – a squalid , tented squat on the outskirts of the @entity14 port			1
the previous one in the town was bulldozed two months ago			1
that followed the clearance in 2009 of the original @entity43 area on the outskirts , and the razing of the notorious @entity47 refugee centre in 2002			1
all of that was meant to have put an end to the constant , ever - growing flow of hopefuls waiting to cross the @entity52 by any means possible			2
all it did was to drive them to other parts of @entity13			1
desperate : two migrants try to break into a container lorry and so , @entity33 is currently a miserable but convenient stepping - stone to the @entity27 for more than 500 itinerants , a population rapidly swelling with families fleeing @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
so it is not surprising that on friday – despite threats of eviction , alleged beatings from police and an international outcry by homeless charities and migrant help groups – so many insisted they would stay for as long as it takes to get to @entity1			2
as one teenage @entity23 put it : ‘ we will get there eventually			1
’ the new jungle is situated on the seaward side of a road used by lorries heading to the port			1
it is a swathe of wasteland and sand dunes , owned and used by a chemical factory to bury supposedly non-toxic waste			0
many of the migrants are men in their twenties , sometimes accompanied by women and children			1
they spend nights under canvas with no drinking water or sanitary facilities – then attempt to leap on @entity27 bound trucks about to board ferries			0
others attempt to cut their way into trailers at truckers ’ cafés , where drivers rest before crossing to the @entity27			0
large numbers of @entity103 started to arrive after being evicted from squats in @entity13 and random camps on the outskirts of town , joining @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 evicted from previous camps			1
they were among thousands of migrants who have risked their lives crossing the @entity116 to reach @entity117 and a better life			1
many have perished either from drowning or suffocation on overcrowded fishing boats they sailed in			0
luckier ones were rescued by the @entity124 navy after their boats got into difficulties near the island of @entity128 , 100 miles from @entity129			0
six suspected illegal migrants were caught by police after smuggling themselves into @entity27 in a shipment of new @entity133			1
officers were involved in a dramatic chase at a motorway service station after the men climbed out of the sports cars and tried to run			0
the would - be migrants from @entity24 had hidden themselves inside the @entity133 , which can cost as much as £ 110,000 , on the back of a transporter			1
six suspected illegal migrants were caught by police after smuggling themselves into @entity27 in a shipment of new @entity133 they escaped detection because the @entity124 - made cars were covered in protective fabric sleeves which can be unzipped			1
but when the lorry driver parked up at @entity149 on the @entity150 in @entity151 yesterday the men tried to make a run for it			0
it is not known when the men hid themselves in the sports cars			0
they were handed over to immigration officials , who will assess whether they have a right to remain here			0
yesterday , a water pipe to a factory sports hall , tapped into by migrants for their water supply , was cut off			2
they now have to rely on bottles of mineral water brought by aid workers to drink and wash themselves			0
sixteen - year - old @entity23 girls @entity167 and @entity168 told the @entity169 they had taken months to reach @entity13 from their homeland			1
‘ we both want to learn , to study commercial sciences in @entity1 , ’ said @entity167			0
sixteen - year - old @entity23 girls @entity167 ( left ) and @entity168 ( right ) said they had taken months to reach @entity13 from their @entity23 @entity23 and @entity25 migrants camp in the grounds of a chemical factory in @entity13			1
the encampment has been dubbed @entity33 ‘ we just want a life			1
we left @entity23 because there was no life for us there			1
we will eventually reach @entity1 but we have no money to pay people smugglers to get us on to lorries so we will just carry on trying to stow away			0
’ there are numbers of @entity24 at the camp , as well as some @entity108 whose tents are pitched away from the @entity103			1
arrested migrants are usually released after several hours			2
@entity187 has admitted @entity188 ca n’t win the next election unless it becomes tougher on immigration			0
the @entity191 said @entity117 ’s freedom of movement rules needed to be reformed			0
his intervention comes amid growing concern among senior @entity188 figures that the party could lose votes to @entity199 in may ’s election			0
mr @entity187 said @entity188 would seek to toughen up laws which allow @entity203 citizens to enter @entity27 with few restrictions			0
he said the party could not afford to look ‘ out of touch ’ on immigration if it was to have a chance of victory			0
in an interview with the @entity211 , he also refused to rule out new taxes to fund social care or the @entity214 , saying people ‘ rightly feel they pay too much tax already ’			0
he added : ‘ if we are going to win the next election , which i think we can , on jobs and the @entity214 and standing up for people on low and middle incomes against an out - of - touch government , then we can not look out of touch on an issue that people really care about			0
’ in some cases they are deported , usually to @entity228 as migrants claim that their point of entry into the @entity203 was in that country			2
the migrants then return the few miles from @entity228 to resume attempts to stow away to @entity27			2
@entity13 authorities insisted migrants would be evicted from the camp ‘ imminently ’			1
a police spokesman likened the job of controlling increasingly angry and frustrated migrants to ‘ trying to empty an ocean with a teaspoon ’			2
meanwhile , another night of opportunity beckoned for those trying to smuggle themselves to @entity27			0
