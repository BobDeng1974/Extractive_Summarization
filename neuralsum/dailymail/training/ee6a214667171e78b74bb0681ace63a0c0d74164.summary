@entity79 defiantly dismissed the incident , saying the @entity2 ' are trying to make some sort of a point , and i do n't think we should dignify it with too much of a response '			1
he added : ' i think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets , the pilots , the systems in place to protect the @entity17			2
' but former air chiefs rubbished the prime minister 's claims , saying the number of @entity17 fighter squadrons had plunged from 26 at the end of the @entity12 to just seven following heavy @entity34 cuts by successive governments			1

' if @entity74 wanted to attack , he would not send a pair of bombers , he would send the lot and saturate our defences ; we could n't cope			2
' the @entity34 is a really good aircraft but with their relatively small numbers they would be overwhelmed : the @entity2 would outflank us , go around us or just go through us			1
' he added : ' the modern generation of politicians has grown up in absolute security – they 've never felt a threat to their existence , safety or security			0
' they 've taken peace for granted and decimated the @entity180			0
let 's hope we do n't pay the price			0
