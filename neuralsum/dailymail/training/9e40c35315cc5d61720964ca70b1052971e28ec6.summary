have you ever wondered what might happen if you leave the tap running for too long at home ? this astonishing frozen waterfall was created out of a building in @entity9 in @entity9 province , north - east @entity6 , after seventh - floor resident @entity4 , 58 , left the hot tap on all winter			1
he had lived for 35 years in the property scheduled for demolition to make way for a new shopping centre - and when developers managed to buy all the other flats , he was left as the only resident			2
as winter approached , mr @entity4 was worried that the uninsulated water pipes running up through the unused and unheated flats below him would freeze , leaving him without running water			1
amazing : this spectacular frozen waterfall was created out of a building in @entity9 in @entity25 , @entity6 , after the owner left the hot tap running so in order to keep the temperature of the pipes above freezing he simply switched on the tap - and then diverted the warm water to flow down the side of the building			1
he said : ‘ the water running into the pipe is from underground where it is above freezing and that is stopping the water pipes in my house from freezing			2
if that had happened i really would have had to move out			0
they want me to move			0
' but what they were offering was not enough for me to get another place so i 'm refusing to leave			0
i do n't have anywhere to go anyway			0
’ ironically the spectacular waterfall has now drawn attention to his case in international media and council officials are urging developers to settle the matter so that the project can move on			0
mr @entity4 said : ‘ the weather is warmer now so there is no danger of the pipes freezing - although i think it might take a while for the waterfall to melt			1
‘ in any case i understand the developers may be prepared to make me a better offer now - i hope so			2
it is very lonely here in my apartment with nobody else around			0
’ high up : mr @entity4 had lived for 35 years in the property scheduled for demolition to make way for a new shopping centre - and when developers managed to buy all the other flats , he was left as the only resident frozen : in order to keep the temperature of the pipes above freezing mr @entity4 simply switched on the tap - and then diverted the warm water to flow down the side of the building			1
