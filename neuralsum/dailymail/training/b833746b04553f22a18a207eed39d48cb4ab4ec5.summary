hi - tech : @entity0 , pictured , of @entity1 , has suggested that the public should start reporting crimes using web services such as @entity5 the days of reporting crimes by walking into a police station or dialling 999 could soon be over , as one of @entity11 's top officers has predicted that the public will start using @entity5 to contact police instead			1
@entity0 , deputy chief constable of @entity1 , argues that modern technology such as social networks can make the police more responsive to the demands of the public			1
however , he also admitted that it would help the force save money in a time of squeezed budgets which is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of officers			0
critics have spoken out against the idea of reporting crimes online , arguing that it is no substitute for face - to - face contact - and expressing concern that the online phone service could compromise crime victims ' privacy			2
but mr @entity0 said today that he would consider setting up @entity5 conversations between police and victims or witnesses of crimes			1
while it is not exactly clear how the proposal would work , it is possible that 999 callers would be able to leave their details with an operator and get a @entity5 call back from a duty officer			0
mr @entity0 said it was ' paramount ' to ensure that the public could speak to an officer directly , but argued that @entity5 is as good a way of doing that as meeting in person			2
he added : ' for instance in @entity55 they have an app where people can report graffiti when they see on the street and that goes straight through to someone in the works department to do something about it			0
' it takes a whole lot of cost out and obviously those sorts of opportunities exist for us in the police as well			0
' bobbies on the beat : but budget cuts are likely to reduce the number of officers in most forces similarly , insurance firm @entity78 allows customers to register mobile phone thefts online and make a claim for a replacement within minutes			1
the policy would be a drastic change from current practice - @entity1 , like most other forces , explicitly tells the public not to report crimes via @entity88 and other online media			1
however , some have suggested that police could be using technology to lessen the impact of budget cuts - for example , @entity1 faces a 25 per cent cut to its funding over the next few years			1
in response to a similar scheme mooted by @entity100 last year , the @entity97 claimed that the plans could be a ' substitute ' for rigorous policing			0
' when police forces embrace new technology it should not be as a means of coping with the effects of budgetary cuts , ' vice-chairman @entity104 said			2
@entity111 , assistant chief executive of the charity @entity112 , told @entity113 : ‘ anything that makes it easier for a crime victim to make a report to the police is welcome , as long as victims can be sure they are transmitting information confidentially and there is no assumption that they all have the technology or want to make a report this way			0
‘ reporting a crime remotely is one thing , but can not replace a “ scene of crime ” investigation			0
if the police do n't do a thorough investigation , there is a big risk that critical evidence could be missed and that would mean criminals are more likely to get away with it			0
’ however , a spokesman for @entity1 emphasised that mr @entity0 's remarks do not represent the force 's official policy , and there are no immediate plans to start accepting calls via @entity5 .			1

@entity0 of @entity1 calls for greater use of technology
he claims it will help public connect with the police more *quickly* and easily
but critics have suggested that hi - tech plans are cover for budget cuts
