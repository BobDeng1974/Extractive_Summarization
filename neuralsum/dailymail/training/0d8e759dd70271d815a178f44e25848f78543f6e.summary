the ' no makeup selfies ' which have taken the internet by storm over the last two days are thought to have raised a staggering £ 2 million for charity			1
but while charities such as @entity6 and @entity7 are delighted , some critics have slammed the campaign for making light of the deadly disease			1
on this morning 's today programme on @entity12 , student and blogger @entity13 , 22 , said that while it was ' fantastic ' that so much money had been raised , the campaign was flawed			1
@entity17 , left , and @entity13 , right , appeared on @entity12 's today programme			1
miss @entity17 said it was a ' great way to promote awareness			1
' miss @entity21 said that while all the money raised was ' fantastic , ' deeming barefaced selfies as courageous was wrong ' i did n't agree with the campaign 's original format , which was simply people writing , " no makeup selfie " without including donations or link to charities , ' said miss @entity21 on the news and current affairs programme			1
' i do think that in its current state , raising so much money , its been fantastic			0
' but if women not wearing makeup is deemed as brave when held against cancer , it does say quite a bit about society today			1
' i know the campaign was to normalise women not wearing makeup , but to suggest that by doing so is being exposing and leaving somebody vulnerable , that is problematic			1
' anyone using social media over the last 48 hours ca n't fail to have noticed a flurry of snaps featuring women with no slap on			2
in fact the trend has taken @entity54 and @entity55 by storm with thousands of females wiping off their makeup and posting photos using the hash tag # @entity60			2
also speaking on the today programme was model @entity17 , 21 , who posted a barefaced selfie of herself in the bath			1
' i did n't think twice about posting one of these pictures , ' she told the programme			2
' i just thought , " wow , what a great way to promote cancer awareness			1
" @entity17 's own barefaced selfie , taken in her bath			2
miss @entity17 defended the trend , saying that anything that promoted awareness and raised money for charity was a good idea ' i took a selfie in the bath , posted it online and it got a lot of attention which is good			1
' i do n't feel i was particularly courageous doing it , but it 's a good message to send out there			0
' women are exposing themselves and showing that more vulnerable side in the same way that we 're all vulnerable to cancer			2
' miss @entity91 , a law student at @entity92 , argued that promoting the act of not wearing makeup as courageous , was worrying			2
' i think that , in 2014 , if its considered that ground - breaking that women are n't wearing makeup , i do n't really understand why , ' she said			1
' it 's like you shave your head for cancer or get in a tub of baked beans for cancer , you do something that 's out of the ordinary			2
' everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on @entity54 and @entity55			0
@entity112 says it 's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can @entity117 , left , posted her no makeup selfie to @entity55 , as did @entity119 on the right @entity122 , while not affiliated with the # nomakeupselfie hashtag , are supporting it @entity124 ( left ) and @entity125 ( right ) posted no makeup selfies to raise awareness @entity128 encourages friends on @entity55 to donate with her makeup - free selfie though nobody seems to know where the idea came from , the rule seemed to be that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to do the same with all posting that the photos were to ' raise awareness of cancer '			1
after becoming aware of the flurry of selfies , @entity7 sent out a tweet saying : ' we ’re loving your # cancerawareness # nomakeupselfie pics ! the campaign is n’t ours but every £ helps # beatcancersooner			1
' @entity7 says so far it has raised £ 2million			1
those posting the selfies or nominating others to do so are texting the word beat to 70099 to donate £ 3			2
@entity155 , director of communications at @entity122 said , ' the # nomakeupselfie @entity54 trend is n’t something @entity122 started – but it ’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family			1

@entity166 's daughter @entity168 also put in her support			0
' if people would like to choose to support our work to beat cancer sooner , they can visit www.cruk.org			0
' it 's not known where or how the trend for using a no makeup selfie started this time around although last week author @entity179 caused an online storm with a similar campaign in support of actress @entity183 and her appearance at the @entity185			2
now , following this new viral selfie campaign the @entity186 has more than 153,690 likes and hundreds of photo uploads			0

' i was nominated by my friend and by doing so i donated £ 5 to the charity which i would n't have done if i had n't seen the status ! ' @entity212 promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to @entity122 social media users have taken the internet by storm posting no - makeup selfies and now the @entity253 of @entity55 and @entity54 have decided they too want to get their mugs in on the action and a flurry of selfies featuring men in makeup have started appearing online			1

@entity292 , left , went with eyeliner and blusher while , @entity295 , right chose a smoky eye and pink lips some of the fellas seem to have gone girly and cute , while others were maybe inspired by @entity301 outfits when they got out the slap , but their efforts were all commendable			0
