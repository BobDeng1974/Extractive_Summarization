this is the moment a foul - mouthed rail fare cheat was on the receiving end of some rough justice , after being bundled off a train by a passenger			1
footage of the teenage troublemaker being thrown off a train by a fed - up fellow traveller on the @entity11 service between @entity12 and @entity13 has become a viral hit after being uploaded to @entity15			1
it begins when a conductor is told the teenager does n't have a ticket and tells the driver of the train to stop until the youngster gets off			1
scroll down for the video is there a problem ? after the conductor has been remonstrating with the teenager ( his white beanie hat can just be seen popping over the seats ) , the ' big man ' stands up and approaches the conductor time to move on son : the burly passenger looks down on the teenager and offers the conductor his assistance when the youth refuses a shouting match ensues until a passenger , later referred to as ' the big man ' leaps to his feet and frogmarches him off the train - and keeps pushing him off when he repeatedly tries to re-board the service			1
a two - and - a - half minute video clip - ‘ @entity45 ’ - was posted three days ago and has already been viewed almost 200,000 times			0
in the clip , the white - haired @entity11 worker tells the youth : ' i ’ll sit here all night pal			0
i ’m getting paid for this but they ( the passengers ) will start moaning			0
' the clip begins by showing the ticket inspector demanding the youngster leaves the train			1
he says he only has a single ticket to travel in the opposite direction			1
the youth responds by swearing back at him the @entity11 worker then tries to embarrass the non-payer in to leaving ' fare dodging ' passenger @entity67 , 19 , has defended his behaviour after being tracked down by a local paper			1
he told the @entity70 : ‘ i had been out celebrating after an exam and i was half asleep on the train			0
‘ i did have a ticket but i must have handed over the wrong one to the conductor			2
the next thing i know this big guy is manhandling me to the door and throwing me off			2
university student @entity67 , who is studying surveying , added : ‘ i could n’t believe it when the footage turned up on @entity15			1
' he said he still has cuts and bruises over his cheeks ( pictured above ) and legs			0
the video continues with the lad protesting his innocence and claiming that he showed the @entity11 employee his ‘ f * * * * * g ticket ’ while a group of stunned young children sit close by with their furious mother			2
but the conductor adds : ' no you have not			0
' the video goes on to show the boy , wearing a beanie hat , produce a single ticket that allows travel in the opposite direction			2
the conductor repeats his previous threat telling the youth : ' no you are off , we will sit here all night			0
why should they pay and not you ? ' it is at this point that a tall , heavyset passenger gets up , approaches the pair and asks ‘ is there a problem here ? ’ before declaring ‘ no problem - right you , off ’			0
he then grabs the lad by the scruff of his neck and bundles him off the train , trying not to clatter into other passengers			0
the teenager tries unsuccessfully a couple of times to barge his way back on before the train doors close			0
as the large man heads back to his seat the carriage erupts into applause and one passenger is clearly heard saying ' @entity130 , big man '			1
a @entity11 spokesman said : ' while we welcome the public ’s support of our zero - tolerance stance on anti-social behaviour , our staff are trained in conflict management and we do not expect members of the public to take matters into their own hands			2
' we are investigating the incident , which appears to show a person travelling without a valid ticket , refusing to pay for the journey , and swearing at a staff member in full view of customers			2
' once at the train doors , the ' big man ' and the ticket collector heave the youngster off the carriage and out you go : the passenger pushes the teenager on to the platform			1
each time he tries to get back in , he pushes him back out again the ticket inspector waves away any further protests by the teenager			0

teenage ' fare dodger ' @entity67 , 19 , comes forward to defend his behaviour , saying he did have the right ticket and was ' manhandled ' by the ' big man '
