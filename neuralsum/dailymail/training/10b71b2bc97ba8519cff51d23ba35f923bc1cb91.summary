by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:41 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:28 est , 3 december 2013 the @entity4 today boasted of its long roster of women sports presenters , headed by @entity7			1
the blunder of including a man at the top of a list of female stars came as @entity14 bosses insisted pundits were appointed on merit , and not their looks			0
mps accused tv executives of only allowing ‘ very young , attractive ’ women on screen , while male presenters tend to be middle - aged , fat and bald			1
star : @entity26 host @entity7 was named in a list of the @entity4 's top female presenters senior figures from the @entity4 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 were giving evidence on women ’s sport to the @entity35			1
they faced accusations of ‘ nauseating political correctness ’ for claiming they used female presenters to increase the number of women and girls watching			1
@entity4 director of sport @entity45 hit back insisting that female presenters were hired on merit , authority and credibility with a long track record of excellence in sports broadcasting			1
but she committed a gaffe when she named father - of - four @entity55 as one of the @entity4 ’s ‘ fantastic ’ female pundits			1
she told @entity18 : ‘ we have some fantastic women presenters who have long - standing careers , genuine expertise and are there absolutely to enhance the credibility of what we do			1
‘ we have @entity7 , we have @entity65 , we have @entity66 , we have @entity67 , we have @entity68 now doing @entity69 , we have a new sports correspondent @entity70			0
they are there on merit			0
’ spoof : internet wags linked to this picture of @entity7 dressed as @entity76 in a @entity78 advert as proof he is in touch with his feminine side surprise : @entity7 responded with ' yikes ' after discovering he had been described as a ' fantastic women presenter ' the slip - up at a hearing designed to promote the role of women in sport was quickly ridiculed online			1
@entity7 himself tweeted ‘ yikes ’ while new @entity4 formula 1 presenter @entity68 joked : ‘ well you have n’t seen @entity7 on a friday night			0
’ @entity93 , a former international gymnast who presents a variety of shows , added : ' he 's very in touch with his female side - it 's what makes him so universally loved			1
' other presenters hit back at the idea that broadcasters only use young women to lure in more viewers			2
@entity106 mp @entity105 said those appearing on screen were young and attractive ‘ with one or two exceptions ’			1
jokes : sports host @entity66 ( left ) said @entity7 was in touch with his feminine side while @entity114 presenter @entity68 joked that people should see him ' on a friday night ' reaction : @entity114 presenter @entity117 was among @entity7 's colleagues to post jokes online about the gender gaffe grilling the tv chiefs he said : ‘ we very seldom see @entity67 in the back pages but suddenly she 's on the front pages today because she 's lost some weight			2
‘ there 's a feeling out there that if you 're over 30 in the sports pundit game then you 're finished			0
’ he went on : ‘ is it coincidental that the vast majority of women presenters , pundits etc are all very young , attractive people , with one or two exceptions ? ‘ if you look at their male counterparts they are all mature , fat , bald like the rest of us			2
’ @entity67 presents sport on the @entity4 , @entity32 and @entity31 but @entity93 , who has presented football , athletics and swimming for the @entity4 , wrote on @entity145 : ‘ we are all over 40 on @entity146			2
’ head of @entity31 @entity148 said having female presenters and pundits ‘ makes for a richer viewing experience ’ and ‘ often does make a difference in terms of how an audience will react ’			2
@entity155 , executive editor of @entity30 , said : ‘ women make up 30 per cent of our audience and they go to football matches , they go to cricket matches , they play sport			0
‘ it 's quite right that they are reflected in our presenter line - up			0
our presenters are all experienced , qualified journalists and they are there on merit			0
’ but @entity169 mp @entity168 said there was no proof that using female presenters helped to boost the number of women watching and taking part in sport			1
he said : ‘ it 's a masterclass in politically - correct , tokenistic , tick - boxing competition			0
to be perfectly honest , it 's rather nauseating			0
‘ you have got absolutely no idea whether it makes any difference to whether more women watch the programme , you 've got no idea whether it increases the audience for sport more generally			0
‘ you are simply doing it for one reason only : to be able to come here and say we 've managed to tick this box			0
