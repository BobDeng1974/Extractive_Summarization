i just think that he ’s more forgiving			0
' over dinner , she decided to become involved with his anti-bullying campaign - even though this would mean working across the street from her parents , whom she had n't seen in four years			1

' with @entity74 and my dad - @entity80 - the only way to get their love and affection was to talk about hell ' holidays like @entity139 and @entity140 were deemed ' too pagan ' , so the @entity2 kids were only allowed to celebrate birthdays			1
they attended public school , but since they were n't allowed to go to dances their social lives largely revolved around picketing			2
' we would use it to go on vacations			0
you go , you picket , you do some fun stuff			0
i have a picture of me in @entity155 with two signs : “ @entity10 hates f * * s ” and “ @entity10 hates @entity155 , " ' @entity26 says			1
' why does he hate @entity155 ? because we wanted to go there !

then in 2009 , @entity26 took a photo of herself and her sister @entity180 while picketing @entity181			0
when she showed her grandfather , he said the girls looked ' like models '			0
but the reaction from the family was immediate : ' i showed up , and 30 church members had filled up the big game room			1
like a show was being put on or something , ' @entity26 recalls			0
' and they started in : the initial issue was the bikini , but the bigger problem was the way i was reacting			0
because i had stood up for myself			0
' going abroad : since leaving @entity26 has been on several trips with her husband @entity174 , since church members were not allowed to leave the country @entity26 left the church on friday the 13th			1
the next few months traumatic : she got a haircut for the first time in her life , but also believed that the plane she got on may crash because @entity10 wanted her to die			1
she ran into the cute former patient @entity174 on the street , and once they started dating he told her he did n't care about her past			2
they married in 2011 in @entity216 , and since her parents were n't at the wedding she walked herself down the aisle			2

' ' i want my cousins and my nieces and nephews to see that the world is n’t mean and hateful and evil and full of vicious people ' in the past few years , around 20 church members have left - most in their teen and early twenties			1
