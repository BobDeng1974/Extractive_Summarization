by @entity0 when she was seven years old , @entity1 was taken away from her father after her parents ' divorce and whisked away to @entity5			1
the 25 - year - old award - winning photographer had spent 15 years trying to reconnect with her father , until finally last year she showed up on his doorstep in @entity8			1
six months later , @entity1 moved in with her long - lost dad in order to try and rebuild their relationship			2
in her own words : @entity1 , 25 , an award - winning photojournalist , wrote of her long - lost dad ( pictured ) : ' as a little girl , my father felt like a secret being kept from me			1
when i would ask my mother about him , she would tell me he was gone ' broken home : when @entity1 was seven years old growing up in @entity33 , her parents divorced and soon after the girl moved to @entity5 with her mother and brother , leaving their dad behind @entity1 , a 2010 graduate of @entity38 , documented her journey in a series of thought - provoking photographs collectively titled ' inventing my father			1
’ in a first - person account originally written for the @entity45 last month , @entity1 , who is currently based in @entity43 , looked back on the day in october 1996 when her life changed forever			2
@entity1 , her brother and their mother were barely making ends meet living in @entity33 after the divorce , with the family having to collect bottles in exchange for food			1
then one morning , @entity1 's mother told her two children that they were going on a trip			1
the following day , the @entity59 were in @entity5			0
the 7 - year - old girl never got to say goodbye to her father who was left behind			1
@entity1 's mother marked the end of her marriage marred by her husband 's frequent and prolonged absences by cutting him out of every family photo in their albums			2
turning back time : @entity1 's father inscribed an old photo of his daughter in @entity74 : ' i am searching for the little girl in her , the little girl i used to know			1
the one i was close to			0
in myself , i am looking for the remains of those feeling i once had for her ' precious mementos : a suitcase belonging to @entity1 's grandfather filled with undelivered letters , a newspaper clipping and a shirt for her brother 's wedding touching the past : @entity1 also got to meet her 90 - year - old grandfather , a painter whose works still hang in her father 's apartment in @entity8 @entity1 eventually forgot how he looked , but every time she saw a plane in the sky over their home , she would imagine that her father was on his way to her			1
@entity1 knew very little about her father growing up			2
from the morsels of information grudgingly shared by her mother , she learned that he was a writer who enjoyed reading @entity104 and wanted her to grow up to be a dancer			0
@entity1 ached for her absent father 's approval , so she studied ballet for eight years until an injury at age 16 brought her dream of becoming a dancer crashing down			1
it was not until she entered @entity38 to study writing that she picked up her first camera			0
she eventually went on to a successful career as a photojournalist covering the @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
in 2013 , some 15 years after she became separated from her father , @entity1 and her brother traveled halfway around the world to @entity8 and knocked on the door of the same apartment they remembered from growing up			1
what @entity1 found inside her estranged parent 's home was a time capsule containing her long - forgotten childhood : family pictures , her brother 's old toys and her elderly grandfather 's oil paintings hanging on the walls			1
dreams from her father : @entity1 grew up hating her father and lying to friends that he has died			2
in 2013 , she sought him out and came face to face with a man who did not resemble the father she had created in her imagination two of a kind : the 25 - year - old photographer admitted that she and her father share many traits , like the desire to be alone and creativity - but she still can not call him ' papa ' family history : @entity1 's father moved from @entity33 back to his native @entity8 to take care of his father after his mother died in a video made in 2013 for the organization @entity157 , @entity1 confessed that having been brought up by her mother to hate her ex-husband , she was filled with anger and shame when she came face to face with him for the first time in 15 years			1
‘ photography gave me strength , ’ she said			0
‘ when i wanted to leave , i knew i had to stay			0
’ the father and daughter looked at old family photos and reminisced about the past - both good and bad			0
getting to know her father was a jarring experience for the young woman : here before her stood a flesh - and - blood man who bore no resemblance to the father figure she had invented for herself			0
growing up in @entity5 , she used to lie to her friends that her father died when she was a child because she was overcome with shame			2
and yet the 25 - year - old photojournalist was interested in getting to know her dad - and he too was eager to make a real connection with his daughter			1
@entity1 wrote : ' fifteen years later , i found my father standing just how i left him			2
in a doorway , neither fully in or out of my life ' sibling envy : miss @entity1 said photography helped her deal with the pain of seeing his father dote over his young daughter from a second marriage @entity192 and in love : an old home video shows @entity1 's parents as college sweethearts in @entity8 - years before their bitter breakup the two would have long , intimate conversations about the past and the present on their morning runs , during which @entity1 ’s father would talk to her about his writing and his thoughts and feelings			1
‘ there were other moments , as well — times outside of our runs , ’ she wrote			0
‘ the night he shared his poetry with me			0
the evening at the symphony when he snuck in chocolates for us			0
we ate them in the dark			0
’ the two also bonded over the photos that she was taking			0
@entity1 and her father would sit together for hours as she edited her work and discuss the images at length			2
but @entity1 often felt awkward around her dad : sometimes when he would move in for a hug , she instinctively pulled away , not quite knowing how to interact with this stranger who gave her life			0
‘ i keep looking for him			0
i think i always will , ’ @entity1 wrote			0
for the 25 - year - old , it was also painful to meet her father ’s second family , including his baby daughter , and see the lanky grey - haired man who had abandoned her dote over his toddler			1
‘ it 's not done yet - it wo n't be done for another 10 years , ’ miss @entity1 said of her intimate photo project			1
‘ it 's my life			0
