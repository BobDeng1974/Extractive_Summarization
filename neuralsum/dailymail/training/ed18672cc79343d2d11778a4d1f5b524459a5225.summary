@entity0 has set the stage for today ’s title showdown between @entity3 and @entity4 by telling @entity5 to clean up his act , and rejecting claims from @entity8 that there is a campaign against the @entity12 leaders			1
@entity3 , who were last night tying up the £ 26.8million signing of @entity15 from @entity16 , will be without @entity5 at @entity17 after he was given a three - game ban for stamping on @entity19 ’s @entity22 in the @entity21 semi-final			1
and @entity0 said : ‘ i know of @entity5 from @entity23			1
his character is not an easy character			2
’ the @entity26 believes the striker has to curb his aggressive streak			2
‘ i hope that this punishment will be a good thing for him to change in the future , ’ he added			2
@entity5 has been in excellent form this season , leading the @entity12 scoring charts with 17 goals @entity4 boss @entity0 has urged @entity3 forward @entity5 to learn from his mistake @entity19 players react after @entity40 stamps on @entity22 ( number 23 ) during the @entity21 semi-final ‘ he does n’t need to do it in that way because he is a very good player			1
but i am sure @entity3 will not lose their next three games just because he is n’t playing			1
big teams can not depend on just one player			0
asked if @entity5 ’s ban cancelled out @entity50 ’s absence on duty at the @entity52 , @entity0 added : ‘ i do n’t think it helps anything			1
i think that @entity5 is an important player for @entity3 and @entity50 is a very important player for us			1
but i do n’t think they decide that both teams depend on just those players			2
‘ so i think it is a very important miss for both teams but @entity3 have other players to replace him			1
‘ @entity50 is a very important player for us but i was not decided that , if he was eliminated from the @entity52 , he would come and play here two days afterwards because i do not think it is the correct way to do it			0
we played without @entity50 in @entity67 and qualified in the @entity68 and against @entity69 , so it is up to other players to demonstrate what they can do			2
’ @entity5 's ban means the striker will not feature in the @entity75 ' potential title - decider with @entity4 champions @entity4 will fall eight points behind @entity3 if they lose today but @entity0 refused to be drawn on his rivalry with @entity8			1
he refused to shake hands with @entity8 over his antics when @entity81 scored a late winner in the corresponding fixture last season , and compared @entity3 to @entity85 after their defensive tactics earned a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity88 in september			1
‘ i wo n’t talk about what @entity8 might do , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i will shake hands with him before the game			2
and after ? yes , probably			0
‘ it was a mistake to compare @entity3 with @entity85			1
@entity3 can play in the way they want and we are going to continue playing in the style i think is best for this team			1
’ @entity4 midfielder @entity50 ( left ) is currently on international duty at the @entity52 @entity0 also dismissed @entity8 ’s claims that there is a ‘ campaign ’ against @entity3 within the @entity12 which is influencing referees ’ decisions against the leaders			1
‘ i hope that in the @entity12 they do n’t have a campaign against anyone , ’ he said			2
‘ i hope the referee makes mistakes for all the teams exactly the same , that the @entity111 make the fixtures in a fair way and the punishments			0
‘ it is the best league in the world and i do n’t think it has any strange things			0
because ( if that is the case ) then you are not competing ( fairly )			0
after that , if you win the title , it ’s not an important title , because it is all arranged			0
’ @entity4 midfielder @entity125 spent 13 years as a @entity3 player , winning three league titles @entity0 , who revealed that @entity128 and @entity129 are injury doubts , believes that @entity125 will be given a good reception on his return to @entity17 where she spent 13 years as a player , whether the former @entity136 midfielder would celebrate a goal against his old club or not			1
he added : ‘ first i prefer him to score the goal			0
after that we will see if he celebrates or if he does n’t celebrate			0
if he scores , i celebrate			0
‘ i am sure that @entity125 will receive the best reception from their fans that they can do			0
he is a top player			0
he is maybe the most important in their history			0
he gave so many things to that club			0
if he could n’t continue playing there , he can play here			0
that is not his fault			0
i am sure the fans will repeat the reception they gave here to @entity125 in the first game			2
’ meanwhile , @entity157 will fly in from @entity158 on @entity3 owner @entity160 ’s private jet on saturday to complete his move to @entity17 , with @entity162 set to move in the other direction on loan			1
@entity16 coach @entity165 confirmed on friday a deal for the @entity168 winger had been agreed , saying : ‘ it was a sale that had to be done			0
i ’m happy for him because he is going to a big club			0
’ the clash between @entity8 and @entity0 's sides could potentially decide the league title			1

@entity0 says @entity5 must accept his three - game ban
@entity5 was punished *retrospectively* for a stamp on @entity19 's @entity22
the striker has been one of @entity3 's *key* players this season
he will miss the @entity12 clash with @entity4 on saturday
