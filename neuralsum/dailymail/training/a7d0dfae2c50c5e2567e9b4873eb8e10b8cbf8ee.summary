by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 did not insist on a ' biting clause ' in @entity4 's contract despite fears he could bite again , according to @entity1 president @entity6			1
the @entity8 striker is currently restricted by a four - month ban that will delay his debut with the @entity12 club until late october at the earliest - but @entity1 claim that did n't make them rethink a move for the £ 75million former @entity17 hitman			1
and while @entity6 said another biting incident ' could happen ' - the team that claim to be ' more than just a club ' have not enforced a contractual agreement linked to biting on their new ' perfect player '			2
he knows he did wrong , ' @entity6 told @entity38			0
that 's very important for us			0
that means he knows that he did not do things properly - and of course , coming to our city , coming to our club , there 's going to be a way of managing @entity4 , because at @entity17 he was a perfect player			2
' regarding what @entity1 would do if @entity4 was to bite again - having done so on @entity48 , @entity17 and @entity50 duty , @entity6 was unwilling to commit to any form of action			1
going in for the kill : @entity4 makes his move towards @entity55 at the @entity56 against @entity57 strike : the @entity8 no 9 sinks his teeth into the shoulder of the @entity63 centre back painful : @entity4 was left holding his teeth but he would have been more hurt by @entity65 's hefty four - month ban here we go again : @entity4 's @entity56 bite was his third on the field having also done it for @entity48 and @entity17 ' this is a question that a lot of people now ask us , ' he said			1
' we can not talk about something that could happen or not			0
what we know is that we accept this responsibility and he also wants this responsibility			0
' there is no clause			0
if the clause did exist we would n't say it , but it does n't exist			0
' world class : when not suspended for his antics @entity4 is one of the world 's most fearsome strikers @entity1 's no 9 : although he ca n't be unveiled due to the ban , @entity1 fans are getting ready for their new star @entity90 fixed for @entity4 return date			1

@entity6 says @entity1 did n't rethink deal after @entity65 ban
*controversial* striker made £ 75million move after @entity56 bite
@entity4 took four month *suspension* from all *football* activity
@entity32 club say @entity4 's apology was ' very important ' for them
but @entity6 admits they do n't know if @entity4 will bite again
while @entity1 say they would n't admit to a clause , they claim it does not exist
