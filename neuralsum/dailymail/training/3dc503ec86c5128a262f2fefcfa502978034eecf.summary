by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 08:59 est , 21 november 2013 obese @entity2 pilots and air traffic controllers will soon need to be screened for sleep apnea , a condition that can cause daytime sleepiness and potentially jeopardise passenger safety , according to a new federal policy			1
the @entity10 's chief medical officer told physicians in a recent memo that they will shortly be required to calculate the body mass index ( @entity14 ) of pilots and controllers and send those with a @entity14 of 40 or more to be evaluated by a sleep specialist			1
obstructive sleep apnea ( @entity20 ) is a potentially serious disorder in which a person 's breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep			1
it commonly affects people who are overweight			0
too fat to fly ? obese pilots will soon be screened for sleep apnea , a potentially life - threatening condition which causes daytime drowsiness and can lead to heart attacks and strokes ( file picture of unconnected pilots ) the @entity10 said the condition has ' significant safety implications ' from excessive daytime sleepiness to personality disturbances , cognitive impairment and sudden cardiac death			1
' untreated obstructive sleep apnea is a disqualifying condition for airmen and air traffic control specialists , ' dr @entity41 , the @entity42 , said in the memo to aviation medical examiners			1
while the condition has been frequently discussed at flying safety meetings , and has been a ' hot issue ' at the @entity54 for several years , the new policy will require airmen and controllers who are diagnosed with @entity20 to be treated before they can be medically certificated , @entity49 said			2
the condition is ' almost universal ' in individuals with a body mass index over 40 and a neck circumference of 17 inches or more , @entity49 said , though it also affects up to 30 per cent of people with a @entity14 of less than 30			1
' significant safety implications ' : air traffic controllers with a body mass index of 40 or more also face being taken off duty if they have the condition ( file picture of unconnected air traffic controllers ) a body mass index of 40 equates roughly to a 5ft 10in individual weighing 280 pounds , according to the @entity71			1
a bmi of 30 or greater is considered obese			0
@entity49 said that examiners should also be on alert for other sleep - related disorders , from insomnia to restless leg syndrome			2
after the first round of tests , the agency will gradually expand its program to examine individuals with lower bmis , @entity49 said			0
the @entity10 has not announced a starting date for its new policy			0
the plan would be rolled out first to pilots and then to controllers			2
' remember , ' @entity49 wrote , ' you , as aviation medical examiners , are our front line , and your daily interaction with pilots and controllers has an enormous impact on the safety of the national airspace			2
' sleep apnea is a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep			1
it occurs when the muscles and soft tissue in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a blockage in the airway , as shown in the graphic above			0
when this happens , the person tends to wake up momentarily while their breathing returns to normal			0
when they slip back into a deep sleep they often stop breathing again			0
many people with sleep apnea snore and they often feel tired during the day as their sleep is interrupted			1
it is associated with being overweight			0
other risk factors include having a large neck , taking sleeping pills , drinking alcohol and smoking			0
sleep apnea affects about four per cent of middle aged men and two per cent of middle aged women in the @entity131			1
it can affect people of any age but it most common in middle aged people			0
some cases can be treated through lifestyle changes - such as losing weight - but people with more severe cases may require breathing apparatus to keep their airway open			0
if left untreated , sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure , heart attacks , strokes and diabetes			2

@entity2 pilots and air traffic controllers will be screened for sleep apnea
aviation *watchdog* to force doctors to work out their body mass index
anyone with @entity14 of more than 40 will be sent to specialist for evaluation
