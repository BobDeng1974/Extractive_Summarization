by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 18 july 2013 grilled : outgoing @entity2 chief executive sir @entity3 sir @entity3 should step down immediately for ‘ misleading ’ parliament about the scandal surrounding gagging clauses , mps said yesterday			1
the outgoing chief executive of the @entity2 was grilled yesterday about revelations that at least 52 staff have been silenced by law and handed £ 2million in secret severance payments			1
unlike other payoffs to gag health workers – of which hundreds have been handed out in recent years – the so - called judicial mediation deals were agreed by hospital trusts without @entity17 or @entity19 scrutiny			2
one for £ 500,000 was handed to whistleblower @entity20 , the former head of @entity21 , where hundreds of patients are feared to have died			1
he broke his silence earlier this year to tell of ‘ dangerous ’ conditions and a bullying management culture			0
in a combative session of the public accounts committee yesterday , mps challenged sir @entity3 ’s claim three months ago that he thought mr @entity20 was an isolated case			1
the @entity2 boss admitted he had not checked how many had been handed out since he was ordered to by @entity33 three months ago			1
‘ i did n’t ... maybe i should have , ’ he said			0
requests for data under the @entity36 revealed that at least 52 payoff deals were agreed at 38 hospitals in @entity39			1
dozens more hospitals did not reply			2
but the embattled health service boss , who has already agreed to step down from his £ 210,000 - a - year job next year following the @entity45 scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly , denied there had been a ‘ cover up ’			2
sir @entity3 accepted the use of gagging clauses was ‘ not acceptable ’			2
he admitted their use was ‘ widespread ’ in the health service and the private sector and said they did not all apply to people raising safety concerns			0
in a rambling defence to mps , he claimed he had always tried to support whistleblowers in the @entity2 and said : ‘ i can absolutely refute that i have ever been involved in any kind of cover - up in relation to the expenditure that ’s identified			1
‘ i have been absolutely honest and truthful with this committee ... i have always supported people who have stood out against the system			0
’ @entity20 , former chief executive of the @entity68 hospitals @entity2 trust , was paid £ 500,000 to go quietly sir @entity3 tried to blame the @entity17 , saying it had told the @entity2 by letter in 2011 that no approval was needed for payoffs under so - called judicial mediation			1
a hapless @entity17 official then hold how ‘ there was confusion as to what judicial mediation meant ’ in his department and they ‘ did not understand it ’			0
@entity81 , chairman of the committee , said she was ‘ gobsmacked ’ that the payments were agreed with no scrutiny			2
she said sir @entity3 ’s failure to disclose how many had been made was ‘ impertinent ’			2
@entity86 paid a total of £ 145,000 to two whistleblowers mp @entity89 , whose @entity36 request uncovered the figures , revealed that between 2008 and 2011 there were 598 ‘ special severance payments ’ costing £ 14.7million – not including the 52 judicial mediation payments			1
they include two consultants at @entity97 and @entity98 , who were paid £ 300,000 and £ 265,000 respectively in february – a month before sir @entity3 assured @entity58 mr @entity20 was an isolated case			1
mr @entity89 , @entity100 member for @entity101 , said it ‘ stretches credulity ’ that sir @entity3 did not know about the payments and called for him to step down now			2
‘ he should have immediately sought to investigate , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a clear conflict of interest for a hospital , where a member of staff has raised concerns , to use taxpayers money to pay people off with no external scrutiny			0
‘ that does not include payments while they were suspended and potentially massive legal fees , so it ’s the tip of the iceberg			0
‘ when asked to investigate , sir @entity3 agreed to do so as soon as possible and failed to			0
either he did n’t know when he should have or he ’s misled parliament			0
i think he should do the honourable thing now and step down			0
’ sir @entity3 was accused in @entity33 earlier this year of presiding over a ‘ see no evil , hear no evil ’ culture in the @entity2			1
he claimed he had ‘ no idea ’ about the unfolding disaster in @entity45 , ‘ no access ’ to published statistics revealing high death rates and did not know the extent of gagging orders			0
articles in june about secret severance payments to @entity2 staff said that two consultants at the @entity136 were paid ‘ hush money ’			1
we are happy to clarify that while the consultants in question were paid £ 300,000 and £ 265000 , they were not asked to sign gagging orders and continue to work for the trust .			0

@entity2 chief executive *insists* he did not try to *disguise* scale of contracts
told mps that secret severance payment to @entity20 was ' one - off '
figures reveal 52 hospitals made similar gagging payments
