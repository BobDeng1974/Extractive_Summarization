by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 01:59 est , 3 june 2013 when most britons think of their favourite buildings in @entity4 , it 's likely that the @entity5 , @entity6 or @entity7 may well come up			2
but a new exhibition is highlighting the beauty of some of the capital 's lesser known and unexpected treasures , such as the graceful arches hidden inside @entity15 bus garage			1
the free @entity17 exhibition celebrates the city 's extraordinary architecture , which many @entity20 may have seen on their daily commutes , but never really noticed before			1
secret city : @entity23 , which boasted the largest unsupported area under one roof in @entity26 when it was constructed in 1952 , features in the @entity17 exhibition leading architecture critics nominated ten buildings , structures and subways they believe are all too often overlooked and forgotten			1
curated by @entity32 , the exhibition at the @entity34 presents an alternative architectural map of the city			1
instead of palaces and stately homes , the show focuses on bus stations and housing estates			1
each site has been photographed by @entity43 and his images will be displayed as a series of single colour offset prints in the @entity48			2
while many people will have heard of @entity51 , a lesser known graveyard has made the lesser known architecture list			2
@entity53 is one of the magnificent seven cemeteries in @entity4 but is perhaps the least famous and celebrated of them			2
@entity53 , located in south @entity4 , was consecrated in 1840 and opened by the @entity56 as @entity53			2
it is now a @entity58			0
beauty is in the eye of the beholder : the @entity62 in @entity63 , which was built in 1965 , is one of two housing blocks to feature in the show a more surprising addition to the list is the modernist housing complex @entity70			1
the building was constructed during the post @entity73 period of austerity on the site of the bomb - destroyed @entity77 in @entity79 and is one of two residential estates to be nominated			1
the other is the @entity83 , a large residential complex in @entity63 which is dominated by 27 - storey housing block built in 1965			1
another surprising nominee is cabmen 's shelters , the green garden - shed - like buildings which have been dotted around the city since 1874 so taxi drivers can buy ' good and wholesome refreshments at moderate prices '			0
today there are only 13 cabmen 's shelters remaining in @entity4			0
the @entity97 @entity96 is another ' hidden gem ' to be nominated			0
built in 1865 , the walkway was constructed to allow visitors to the @entity102 building , where large exhibitions were held , to pass from the railway station to the grounds without dirtying their fineries by crossing the muddy roads			1
tradition : this is one of 13 @entity111 's shelters left in @entity4			0
the small garden - shed like structures were erected around the city in 1874 to provide affordable beverages for taxi drivers the @entity102 was destroyed by fire in 1936 and the subway is one of the last surviving remnants			2
@entity121 , the @entity123 's railway hidden beneath the streets of @entity4 , has also made the list			0
the six - and - a - half - mile - long underground track was used to transport mail between sorting offices in @entity129 and @entity130 from 3 december 1927 until 31 may 2003			0
@entity4 's historical transport system appears to have dominated the list with @entity133 also making an appearance			0
other sites to make the top ten include the @entity137 , @entity138 and , of course , @entity23			0
@entity23 was designed by @entity140 , @entity141 and partners , with the engineer @entity144 , and was opened in 1952			0
space - age : the ultra-modern looking @entity138 in central @entity4 has made the top ten the garage provides 73,350 sq ft of unobstructed parking space and could originally house 200 buses			0
at the time of construction it was the largest unsupported area under one roof in @entity26			0
since 1988 the garage has been a @entity158 listed building reflecting its importance in post-war architectural and engineering history			0
each nominator has written an overview of their buildings historical and design credentials that will be published in the accompanying journal , @entity17 , @entity167 1 : @entity4			1
the @entity17 photographs will also be produced as limited edition prints available to purchase from the @entity170			1
@entity17 is part of the @entity172 .			1

@entity17 exhibition is on display at the @entity34
it features two housing estates , a bus station , cemetery and even a subway
