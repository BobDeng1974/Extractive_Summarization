@entity0 has left @entity1 ' by mutual consent ' after almost two years as manager			1
the @entity4 looked as if he would be in charge for saturday 's match against @entity7 but chairman @entity8 has decided to act			1
academy director @entity9 , who was briefly joint - caretaker boss with @entity10 before @entity0 's appointment , is the strong bookies ' favourite , with @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 also in the mix. @entity0 ( centre ) has been sacked after @entity1 's 4 - 0 hammering by @entity21 at @entity22 the @entity24 table in a statement @entity8 said : ' @entity0 has worked tirelessly off the field to improve the infrastructure of the football club			1
unfortunately , recent results on the pitch have not reflected all his work off it			0
' the club has faced a difficult time following our relegation from the @entity37 and @entity0 has helped to restructure the club in order for it to become successful again under ever - tightening constraints			2
' i would like to thank @entity0 personally for all his commitment and efforts for @entity1			2
' @entity8 had been loyal to @entity0 - who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints - and believed there were signs the manager was heading in the right direction			1
however , results and recent performances put pressure on him to make a change before @entity1 get cut adrift by the teams above them			0
the main issue seemed to be whether they could pay @entity0 off - and then who would replace him			2
the club also unsurprisingly announced that they had cancelled their friday press conference			0
@entity0 and his no 2 @entity61 leave the pitch after a chastening night for the @entity65 manager odds from @entity67 7 - 2 @entity9 , 10 - 1 @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity15 , @entity68 , 12 - 1 @entity17 , @entity69 , 16 - 1 @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 @entity1 have won just once in the championship this season and are second from bottom with only @entity77 - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them			1
the players did not seem to be playing for @entity0 and the manager , who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side , chops and changes frequently - there were five against @entity21			1
this has led to some horrendous performances , home and away			0
the fans lost patience with him , too , as the vocal minority have become the majority			0
there were pitch invasions against @entity98 on saturday and chants for the manager to go at @entity22			0
those supporters now have their wish .			0

@entity0 leaves @entity1 by ' mutual consent '
@entity1 are 23rd in @entity24 following 4 - 0 *defeat* by @entity21
chairman @entity8 *praised* @entity0 for ' off - the - field ' work
manager lost the @entity1 fans , who called for his head at @entity21
