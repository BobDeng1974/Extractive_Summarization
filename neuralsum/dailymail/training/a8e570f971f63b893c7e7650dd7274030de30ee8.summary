by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter last updated at 10:15 pm on 23rd december 2011 @entity5 women with breast implants at the centre of a health scare have been told there is no evidence they are linked to increased cancer risk			1
it comes after the @entity14 government yesterday announced it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants , made by @entity18 , to have them taken out			1
there are fears the gel inside might leak out and cause cancer			0
panic : @entity24 developed lumps on her spine after her breast enlargement operation but the @entity5 ’s @entity28 stressed that there was ‘ no evidence ’ this was the case			1
more than 40,000 @entity5 women are believed to have the @entity14 - made implants , known as @entity34 , which were among the cheapest on the market			1
fears about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago , when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands			0
the @entity14 health watchdog ordered an inquiry , which subsequently reported ‘ serious irregularities ’ in the implants			1
it has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body			0
so far tests have failed to find any firm evidence the implants could trigger cancer			0
but yesterday @entity14 ’s health minister @entity55 announced that women could have the implants removed , paid for by the @entity14 health service , as a ‘ preventative ’ measure			1
burst : plastic surgeon @entity61 holding defective silicone gel breast implants , which were removed from a patient responding to the announcement , the @entity28 said : ‘ we recognise the concern some women who have these implants may be feeling but we currently have no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with these implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates other than in @entity14			1
‘ we therefore do not believe that the associated risks of surgery from breast implant removal can be justified without further evidence			1
’ it emerged this week that 250 @entity5 women are preparing to sue six clinics which fitted the implants in a class action case next month			1
they are unlikely to be able to sue the implant company itself because it has been declared bankrupt as it has no money and no assets			2
the corrective surgery in @entity14 will be paid for out of public health funds , with a new implant funded if the treatment was done as part of reconstructive surgery following breast cancer			1
while the @entity14 are likely to spend millions reversing implant operations , the @entity5 authorities have continually denied that they are trying to save money by not doing the same thing			1
the @entity102 in the @entity5 said they had consulted with nine countries over safety concerns before making the decision			1
around one in 100 women in the @entity5 receiving a @entity14 - made @entity18 implant has suffered rupture , where the seal has split , exposing the silicone to body tissue			1
sufferers : @entity114 and @entity115 had complications after having @entity18 implants @entity24 , from @entity118 , was one such unlucky patient who suffered a ruptured implant four years after surgery			2
her @entity122 surgeon waived his fee to remove it this year but she still had to pay £ 1,500 for hospital costs and the anaesthetist			2
the 40 - year - old is still suffering today			0
the leaked silicone has spread to her lymph nodes and a scan has revealed two bulging lumps on her spine			0
@entity115 , 30 , who was miss @entity132 2008 , and beauty therapist @entity114 , 39 , have also had the implants removed after suffering painful complications			0
while implants which have ruptured should be removed , experts say other women may face unnecessary complications from procedures to explant - take out - the implants			2
around 270 women are considering legal action , although the company responsible has gone into liquidation so claims are being directed against clinics and individual surgeons			0
@entity149 , director of the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) supported moves made by health secretary @entity152 and the @entity28 and @entity153 ( @entity28 ) to reassure women			1
she said ‘ we are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from the @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with @entity18 breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates			0
a @entity5 health chief said the @entity14 decision to remove the implants had caused ' unnecessary alarm ' ‘ @entity14 are looking increasingly isolated in their stance and their pre-emptive statements have caused unnecessary alarm			1
‘ our advice is that anyone concerned about their breast implants should contact their gp or implanting surgeon			0
‘ there is no evidence to suggest explantation is necessary and on top of that there are , of course , the associated risks with going under general anaesthetic that women should consider before rushing into any surgery			0
’ the @entity14 government admitted this morning that there was no conclusive evidence of a link between the sub-standard silicone and cancer			1
the @entity18 implants were pulled off the market last year , when the manufacturers were closed down by @entity14 authorities after being accused of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years			2
the non-medical grade silicone is believed to have been originally designed for mattresses			0
they have a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among @entity14 women – and have been linked to the death of a @entity14 woman from a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( @entity220 ) , and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases			2
in june , the @entity222 ( @entity222 ) said women with breast implants may have a very small but increased risk of developing @entity220 , with 34 cases of @entity220 identified worldwide			0
@entity14 authorities will cover the cost for women to have the implants taken out			1
but @entity5 regulators have insisted there is no link with cancer – no such cases have been reported here - and there is no need for women to have them removed			2
figures from the @entity28 suggest 84,300 @entity18 implants have been sold in the @entity5 since 2001 , with 411 cases of failure including rupture since 2001			2
based on the assumption that each woman has two implants , at least 42,000 women in the @entity5 could be affected , according to the @entity28			2
in the @entity5 , women are advised to contact their breast implant surgeon if they have concerns			1
@entity250 , ex-president of @entity251 ( @entity251 ) said ‘ there is no medical evidence that these implants need immediate replacement			0
' the current guidelines are that individuals with @entity18 implants should go back to their treatment facility , where the integrity of the implants can be assessed and a regime for monitoring planned			0
‘ clearly many patients may choose to have something done in advance of implant failure , knowing the problems associated with these implants			0
’ @entity5 lawyers claim the @entity28 should have acted sooner and more decisively to protect women			2
@entity271 , a partner at @entity273 solicitors , which is representing more than 250 women , said some of his clients had complained of inflammation , fatigue and fibromyalgia , a musculoskeletal pain disorder			0
he said : ‘ i do not believe that @entity28 ’s reaction to date has been satisfactory			0
i am and have been very critical of their role throughout the history of this product			0

@entity5 health official accuses @entity14 government of causing ' unnecessary alarm '
@entity14 officials say they will cover the cost of implant removal . @entity5 officials deny decision not to remove made on cost grounds
