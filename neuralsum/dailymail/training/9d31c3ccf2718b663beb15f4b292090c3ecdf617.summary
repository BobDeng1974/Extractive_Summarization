in his path was @entity8 , the heiress to the £ 3billion fortune left to her on trust by her father @entity11 after his sudden death in august 2010			2
the story has picked up speed since his return , gathering momentum as @entity8 's daughter continued with her bid for power behind the scenes at @entity21 's			1

may 2013 @entity1 finish 14th in the league , with fans pleased by @entity70 ’s progress			1
august 2013 @entity48 are tipped for a strong season after spending £ 30m in the summer			0
january 2014 @entity2 resigns and @entity8 takes over as chairman , putting @entity70 ’s position at the club in the balance			1
on wednesday night , just after 7pm she won , but the fear is that @entity1 will be the biggest losers			1
@entity2 had tolerated @entity8 until she refused to allow him to continue in his executive role without interference			1
the @entity39 , a banker by profession , established the @entity87 when @entity37 took the club out of administration in 2009			0
he lived and breathed @entity1			2
each day , when he walked up the main staircase at @entity21 's and headed towards his office suite , he passed a mural on the wall which reminded his staff of their ambition			1
@entity8 , who has no experience of running a football club and until recently had little interest in the sport , will run the show from now on			1
@entity8 has been in @entity102 this week , spending much of her time in the offices of her lawyers @entity105			0
she will be non-executive chairman of the club and intends to appoint a chief executive to handle @entity1 's affairs			1
the transition will not be easy			0
@entity1 are a thriving @entity65 club , the good news story as a succession of homegrown players make their way into the first team			2
one of @entity1 ’s academy recruits is @entity2 ’s son , while his wife is also heavily involved in some of the club ’s community projects			1
this week 's events have been bubbling since last summer , when @entity8 arrived unexpectedly at the club 's pre-season training camp in the stunning @entity124 setting of @entity125 , @entity126			1
it was on the banks of @entity129 , on the decking of the @entity131 on the evening of wednesday july 24 , that she made her first serious demands to be involved in the day - to - day running of the club			0
until that moment @entity2 had held her at arm 's length as he went about the business of establishing @entity1 as a force again in the @entity65			1
it was @entity2 who decided to fire @entity43 in august 2010 and replace him with @entity58			0
@entity1 won two successive promotions before @entity70 , who was discovered by @entity2 during a scouting mission to @entity143 for a player two years ago , was brought in on january 18 last year			1
between them they convinced raw academy graduates such as @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 to remain at @entity1 , even when they had better offers elsewhere			1
home is where the heart is : @entity2 's ' @entity1 way ' was epitomised by club captain @entity156 uncertain future : manager @entity70 is ready to leave @entity1 there is a commitment to developing homegrown talent , something @entity2 believes is his responsibility to @entity165 football and the national team			1
all that is now in jeopardy			0
at the club 's @entity174 training centre , the elaborate plans for a world class facility for the game 's top players is coming together at breathtaking speed			2
soon there will be a hotel for the players to stay in when they return from long away trips to avoid disturbing their families at 3am when they return home			0
before the team bus arrives at the appointed hotel for away games , @entity1 staff have already been into the rooms to vacuum them to reduce the risk of infection			0
each player has his own mattress , which is taken to the team hotel the night before the team arrives			0
it is this stunning attention to detail which separates @entity2 and the team he has assembled at @entity21 's			1
they are an ambitious bunch			0
in and out ? @entity70 walks into the reception at @entity21 's on wednesday evening and ( below ) drives away this is @entity2 's vision , something he aspired to when he arrived at @entity1 following the @entity8 takeover in 2009			1
the @entity39 believed he owed it to @entity8 to restructure the club and fulfill his ambition to bring @entity208 football to the south coast for the first time			2
the executive chairman knows that it is a highly ambitious target and yet the players who signed last summer - @entity215 and @entity216 - were convinced they could do it			1
on wednesday morning many of the players were openly threatening to walk away from the club when they realised @entity2 was about to quit			1
many of them have close relationships with the @entity39 and they exchange regular text messages with the team			0
on wednesday night , @entity2 got the message loud and clear			2
@entity226 , @entity227 editor and lifelong @entity1 fan gives his view on his club after chairman @entity2 resigned on wednesday			1
many @entity1 fans will be thinking one thing : here we go again			0
for years , fans endured boardroom rows as the chairmanship of the club swapped hands			0
the football was bad – and the management of the club even worse			0
after years of teetering on the brink finally @entity1 sunk in to @entity49 and administration			0
@entity244 was the saviour of the @entity1			0
he not only rescued the club financially , but built a plan , and put leadership in place to deliver the club back to the top flight			0
it may have taken a while for fans to warm to @entity2 ( and many , including me , were outraged when he ousted former manager @entity58 , pictured right )			2
but every decision he has made has later proved to be right – he was a capable and much envied chairman			0
fans have even started dreaming of trophies and @entity261 football			0
and it ’s not just on - field success that @entity1 fans have had to come to terms with – but a reputation of being a well - run club			1
when @entity8 passed away suddenly in 2010 – just a few years in to his takeover – all @entity1 fans feared that the funding and plans he put in place would die with him			1
after all , how much could the family of this @entity38 billionaire really care about some small team on the south coast of @entity165 ? typically , just as things were starting to look rosy for the @entity1 , a new boardroom row looks set to tear apart everything that has been built			2
with @entity2 gone , @entity70 will surely follow			2
and after that , who next ? @entity156 , @entity148 , @entity216 , @entity284 , @entity285 ? all are envied by others in the top flight			1
a club that seemed upwardly mobile , has sunk its fans in to the depths of despair again .			0

@entity2 quit as @entity1 executive chairman on wednesday
@entity8 will run show at @entity21 's as non-executive chairman
@entity2 had top four ambitions for the club
this row has been bubbling under since last summer
the @entity1 board held *crisis* talks with manager @entity70
fear they will lose the likes of @entity148 and @entity156
