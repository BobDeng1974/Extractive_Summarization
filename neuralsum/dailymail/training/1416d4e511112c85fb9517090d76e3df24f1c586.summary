by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:52 est , 26 may 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 27 may 2012 stroll in the sun : @entity4 in @entity5 on friday the @entity6 has been accused of ' breathtaking arrogance ' after it hired a manager who lives in the @entity9 to oversee the movement of staff four miles across @entity12			1
@entity4 , who lives more than 4,000 miles away in @entity5 , has been handed a key role in the relocation of @entity6 journalists and producers to the new @entity17			1
he was hired despite the fact @entity19 savaged the @entity6 in an official report last year for giving him a senior role in the @entity23 's controversial move to @entity24			1
in a withering attack last may , the powerful @entity25 said the @entity6 had opened itself to ' self - inflicted and predictable ridicule ' by sanctioning the extraordinary arrangement			1
such decisions can not simply be dismissed as inconsequential gaffes			0
they lower the esteem of the @entity6 , its senior management and the @entity34 in the eyes of the ­ public and its own staff			1
' the committee called on @entity34 chairman @entity39 ' to ensure the @entity6 is seen always to lead by example in the future '			1
mps now plan to raise the matter with @entity6 director - general @entity44			1
the @entity45 can reveal mr @entity4 has been transferred to another senior role at the corporation while still living in the @entity9			1
he is a project manager responsible for organising the relocation of more than 5,000 people , as well as technical and broadcasting equipment , from @entity51 at @entity52 , and from @entity53 in @entity54 , to the @entity6 's £ 1 billion new @entity12 headquarters in @entity56			1
last week , however , mr @entity4 was seen strolling in the sunshine through the @entity5 town of @entity59 , where he lives with his wife and daughter			1
last night , @entity63 mp @entity62 , a member of the @entity64 , said : ' this shows breathtaking arrogance by the @entity6			2
we do n't produce these reports for a laugh			0
they have a ­ serious purpose			0
' we have the best interest of the licence fee - payer at heart			0
if the @entity6 is not responding to our criticism , we may have to call them back and hold them to account			2
' the committee chairman , @entity80 mp @entity78 , added : ' i am sure this is something we would want to talk to the director - general about			0
it does look contemptuous [ of the committee ] , almost like a deliberate snub by the @entity6 by giving him a new appointment after the committee was so critical			2
' in his new role , mr @entity4 is attached to a division called @entity92 , which manages the @entity23 's multi-million - pound property portfolio			0
despite the seniority of his position , he is not a @entity6 staff member and is believed to be paid through his own company , @entity97 , which he set up last year			2
the big commute : @entity4 is overseeing the four - mile move of staff from @entity51 in @entity12 's @entity52 to @entity17 in @entity56 , while living more than 4,000 miles away in @entity59 , @entity5 the government is clamping down on such arrangements , which allow individuals to avoid income tax and national insurance , instead paying corporation tax at a lower rate			1
treasury chief secretary @entity108 said last week that he wanted to ban ' off - payroll engagement without sufficient transparency ' throughout the public sector , including the @entity6			2
according to @entity113 sources , he is keen for the @entity6 to publish details of its payments to contract workers			2
@entity6 employees are furious about the special arrangements put in place for mr @entity4 but claim their protests have been ignored by senior managers			2
workers sent a letter to @entity45 last week , describing themselves as ' a group of concerned and angry @entity6 staff '			1
they wrote : ' contrary to indications given by management … the @entity6 has continued to employ mr @entity4 through his own personal ( tax efficient ) service company , engaging him as a freelancer so he pays no paye or @entity133			1
' he has been given the plum job of managing the move of staff to @entity17			0
as employees we have questioned this but received no response from management			0
it 's a scandal and one that , for some ­ reason , management wo n't tackle			0
' mr @entity4 , 45 , and his wife @entity146 , 51 , own two properties in @entity59 , in the heart of @entity5 's racehorse breeding country			2
he was out shopping in the town on friday but declined to speak to a @entity45 reporter			0
@entity152 away : @entity4 's @entity5 home is 4,019 miles from the new @entity17 in @entity12 he started working full - time on his new project on april 1 when he was still involved with the final stages of the @entity24 move			1
earlier in his career , mr @entity4 was on the @entity6 staff for nearly 20 years but was made redundant in 2006			0
however , he was soon working for the @entity23 again despite his move to @entity9			1
as the @entity6 's migration manager , he was employed through a company called @entity162			1
in 2010 , when he was still leading the @entity24 project , he worked 25 weeks in @entity164 , just under the threshold for paying @entity164 income tax			0
yesterday the @entity6 refused to discuss mr @entity4 's salary arrangements but said he covered all the costs of airline tickets and accommodation himself when working for @entity23 in the @entity164			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity4 's personal arrangements , such as where he lives , do not have any bearing on his ability to do the job and do not cost the @entity6 any extra money			0
any suggestion the @entity6 is not complying with @entity180 regulations is not true			0
' @entity39 was unavailable for comment			0
a @entity34 spokesman said : ' the employment of individuals is a matter for the executive , not the trust			0
