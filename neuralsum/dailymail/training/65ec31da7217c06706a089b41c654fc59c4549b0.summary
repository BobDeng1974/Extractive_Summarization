by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 26 august 2013 a @entity2 goblet could be an 1,600 - year - old example of nanotechnology , according to experts			1
the mysterious @entity6 is made of dichroic glass and appears green when lit from the front and turns bright red when a light is shone on it from behind			1
the chalice , which is on display at the @entity14 , @entity15 , uses similar techniques to ' modern ' nanotechnology - the manipulation of materials on an atomic and molecular scale - which scientists believe could be used for everything from diagnosing diseases to identifying bioharzards at airports			1
the mysterious @entity6 is made of dichroic glass and appears green when lit from the front ( pictured ) and turns bright red when a light is shone on it from behind and scientists have only recently found out why			1
the chalice uses similar techniques to ' modern ' nanotechnology scientists only solved the mystery of the colour - changing chalice in 1990 , after being baffled by its behaviour for decades , @entity30 reported			1
after putting broken fragments of glass under a microscope , scientists found the @entity2 had impregnated it with particles of sliver and gold , which they ground down to tiny proportions - around 50 nanometres in diameter - a thousand times smaller than a grain of salt			1
the precise amount of metals has lead experts to hail the @entity2 as ' nanotechnology pioneers ' who really knew what they were doing			1
archaeologist @entity51 , of @entity52 , who researched the cup and its unusual optical properties , called its construction an ' amazing feat '			0
the cup appears to change colour as when light hits it as the flecks of metals ' electrons vibrate in ways that seem to change the colour , depending on where the observer is looking at it			1

here the goblet appears red as it is lit from the inside the chalice was used to hold drink on special occasions and experts believe that when it was filled , the behaviour of the vibrating electrons changed , as well as it 's colour			2
@entity87 , an engineer and nanotechnology expert at the @entity89 at @entity89 told the publication : ' the @entity2 knew how to make and use nano - particles for beautiful art. ' of course scientists could not investigate the effects of the one - of - a - kind cup by filling it with liquid			1
instead , they reportedly imprinted billions of little wells onto a piece of plastic the size of a postage stamp and sprayed them with gold and silver nano - particles to essentially re-create the special configuration of the cup			2
the scientists then poured different liquids into the wells to note the effect they had			0
when they filled a well with water it turned the surface light blue , while pouring oil inside turned it bright red			0
while the experiment may help archaeologists understand how the chalice works , it could also aid scientists in developing devices to detect pathogens in saliva or urine samples , or by identifying liquids terrorists might try and smuggle onto airplanes			0
the @entity6 dates from the @entity127 and was probably made in @entity128			2
it shows a scene from a @entity131 story , where bad tempered king @entity6 is being trapped by vines as a punishment for his latest outburst of anger			2
the cup is the only complete example of ' dichroic ' glass , which changes colour from green to red when light shines through it			2
it is also one of the best examples of a ' cage - cup ' from the time that is made from a solid block of glass that has been carefully carved away until the cup and the figures standing out on it are left			0
sections of the figures are almost standing free and connected only by ' bridges ' to the surface of the vessel			0
the scene on the cup depicts an episode from the myth of @entity6 , a king of the @entity164 ruling at around 800 bc. the story goes that the moody king attacked @entity167 and one of his female followers called @entity170 who called out to mother earth and was transformed into a vine			0
in response to the king 's bad treatment of @entity167 , she coiled herself around the king to hold him captive , while @entity167 and two friends torment him			0
historians believe the myth could have been chosen to elude to a contemporary political event ; the defeat of the emperor @entity184 by @entity185 in ad 324 .			0

@entity6 is made of dichroic glass , which uses similar *tricks* to modern nanotechnology to change colour depending on lighting
after putting broken fragments of glass under a microscope , scientists found the @entity2 had impregnated it with particles of silver and gold
the precise amount of metals has lead experts to hail the @entity2 as ' nanotechnology pioneers '
