by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 11:37 est , 20 november 2012 to celebrate the release of @entity3 , @entity1 talked to the game 's executive producer , @entity4 , on what it takes to build their most epic game yet			1
what made you want to take on @entity11 ? @entity4 : ' we have always have been passionate about bringing incredible stories to a younger audience , and few tales fit the bill more so than @entity11			1
' the opportunity to re-create middle - earth , with its vast array of heroic characters , stunning locations and menacing villains , has been something we ’ve discussed for a long time			1
happy family : expect to meet all of the characters on your journey around middle - earth			2
' however , we were conscious that to do justice to these well - loved tales would be an incredible challenge			2
it ’s only now that our tools and technology have advanced sufficiently to enable us to create a @entity36 middle - earth that meets everyone ’s expectations ( including ours )			1
is this your most ambitious @entity36 project yet ? @entity4 : ' without a doubt			1
the game comprises of eighteen levels , covering the major sections of all three films ; from the battle on the slopes of @entity49 , through to epic recreations of @entity51 , @entity52 and many more			1
' ' additionally , there are more than eighty characters to find and collect , so in these aspects alone we already have a @entity36 game of unrivalled scope			1
' however , on top of this , the players will be able to explore all of @entity36 middle - earth , where dozens of side - quests can be unlocked and @entity65 bricks can be found and forged into new magical items			1
all in all it adds up to the biggest game we ’ve ever created			2
' 3.talk me through the development process			0
have you used the books as inspiration , too ? @entity4 : ' the first thing we do whenever a new game is started is to understand what elements are unique about the property			2
' what makes @entity11 different from say @entity81 or @entity82 ... ? for us the core of the @entity11 story is a sense of a quest or journey : both a physical journey ; from @entity90 to @entity91 , and an emotional one ; with the characters fulfilling their destinies			0
once established we attempt to distil these elements into game - play			1
pixel perfect : @entity96 is instantly recognisable , and audio is taken directly from the movies			0
' the sense of a physical journey has been captured in the creation of @entity36 middle - earth itself			1
by basing the gameplay in an open world , the player really does need to embark on this journey , having to travel to key locations ( such as @entity108 ) where they can engage in “ traditional ” action - adventure levels			1
' this way the journey , encompassing all of the astounding locations and intricate side - quests , truly becomes an integral part of the gamers ’ experience			1
' the sense of the emotional journey is encompassed in the new “ @entity119 ” feature			0
as the characters continue on their quest , so they grow and realise their full potential			0
' @entity124 and @entity125 begin as meek and mild @entity126 , but end up with the nobility of middle - earth bowing down to them , or strider the @entity130 must confront his destiny and become @entity132 the @entity133			2
' to emulate this we reward the player ’s progression with new powers and abilities that are accessed through the @entity119			0
' so , for example , @entity140 is gifted the @entity142 of the @entity143 , @entity125 gains the light of @entity145			0
these amazing magical items grant new powers and abilities to the player ’s characters , emulating the progression they take in the fiction			0
' once these foundations have been set , so the corresponding game mechanics can be prototyped and implemented , alongside the crafting of the levels and environments through which the characters will travel			2
' part of this process is reviewing both the theatrical and written fiction for sources of further inspiration , so fans of the books will notice references that were not included in the films			0
what has been the biggest challenge so far ? @entity4 : ' amongst the many significant challenges we ’ve faced making @entity3 the greatest has been the realisation of the middle - earth itself			2
' the creation of a seamlessly streaming open world was vital to capture the sense of the epic journey , which we identified as being at the heart of the story			1
' the player begins their quest in @entity90 and from here , the snow - capped peaks of the @entity184 can be seen , and players know that they can journey to there without interruption			2
watch your step : @entity140 traverses a snowy peak			0
environments are a mixture of organic and @entity36 materials			1
' once across the mountains and into the lands of the @entity204 so @entity198 , @entity199 and even the glowering @entity200 , endlessly gazing out atop @entity201 , can be seen and reached			0
' this provides a sense of immersion unparalleled in a @entity36 game , and justifies the tremendous investment gone into its creation			1
how have you achieved this with the aging consoles ? @entity4 : ' i ’m delighted that you think so ; we ’re all very proud of what we ’ve created			2
naturally , with the award - winning production design of the movies as basis , we had a terrific head start			2
' but , whilst locations such as @entity108 or @entity225 are recognisable from the films , there are hundreds of other locations that the team have had to conceptualise and build from scratch			0
' here their commitment and dedication has come to the fore , to ensure that all of @entity36 middle - earth looks as fantastic and vibrant as people would expect			1
' one advantage that the current generation of consoles does offer is that the hardware is very familiar to us			2
' as such the team are able to squeeze every last drop of processing power to ensure that the lighting , environments , audio ( to name just a few ) are as stunning as you ’ve already noted			1
any news on downloadable content ? @entity4 : ' with a story of this scale , with such a diverse collection of heroes and villains , there were some that we could not fit into the main game			1
' characters like @entity263 , @entity264 of @entity265 and many others from the films are available as @entity268 , as are others taken from the written fiction , such as prince @entity271 , the @entity272 and @entity273			0
my precious : a frustrated - looking @entity263 takes some time out in the marshes			2
' additionally , we ’re also able to offer some characters that are unique to a @entity36 middle - earth , so we have a mini-balrog or @entity200 in his fair ' 2nd age ' guise			1
' moreover with the “ @entity119 ” feature , the team have also been to create a @entity268 pack of weapons and magical items that are both devastating and humorous in equal measure			0
does the soundtrack stay true to the films ? @entity4 : ' indeed			0
one of our ambitions was to re-create the cinematic feel of the movies – after all this is the first time we ’ve adapted an @entity295 winning film in @entity36 form ! ' as such , the inclusion of @entity300 ’s score is essential in transporting the player to middle - earth right from the very first screen			1
' on top of that we ’ve also included the actual theatrical dialogue , voiced by the original actors , and had it spoken through the mouths of the @entity36 mini- figs. ' we pondered long and hard over this decision , as in most of our previous games the characters have mimed or used simple grunts			1
but as soon as we trialled it what were immediately convinced of its efficacy			0
' having such world - renowned actors like sirs @entity319 and @entity321 delivering their lines greatly increase the drama , as well as providing the story ’s narrative in clear and concise fashion			1
' however , in no way does this detract from the charm and irreverence normally associated with our games , in fact it has provided a whole new medium for @entity36 humour			1
what have you done to expand areas only hinted on in the movies ? @entity4 : one of the many successes of @entity343 ’s adaptations was his ability to conjure up the agelessness of the world			0
' in the written fiction , even the @entity347 are relatively new to middle - earth , and for millennia races and civilisations have risen and fallen			0
' we strived to re-create this timeless quality into the game as well			0
as the player explores all of the secrets of middle - earth , so they ’ll discover ancient castles long abandoned , hidden caves and ruined dungeons			0
fierce : orks are your main foes , but along your quest , you 'll encounter other beasts , too			0
' we were eager to bring this timeless quality across in the game , as we know older gamers will appreciate the depth it brings , and younger gamers will be introduced to it for the first time			0
' i hope it will spark their interest in @entity11 , and inspire them to read the novels and watch the films as they grow older			0
' it ’s an immense privilege , and great responsibility , to introduce this world to a younger audience			0
and , if they do go on and enjoy the broader fiction , the @entity36 games and toys will have framed their experience , and introduced them to the story in a familiar and fun way			1
' follow @entity0 on @entity393 : @ @entity394 and on @entity395 : @entity396 .			0
