' we do n’t know what his movement is after that			2
at some stage he was in the sea , but i ’m afraid the full circumstances will never be known			0
' the effects of this drug are unknown and you would do things you would n’t normally do			0
' we need to get the message out there to the people who want to take it and to the shops which sell it that this drug is dangerous and is not fit for human consumption			0

@entity8 ’s friend @entity91 told the inquest : “ @entity8 had never taken it before			1

' because of the relaxed state when you take this drug , if you are near water then the possibility is you will drown			0

no one is sure what it contains			0
