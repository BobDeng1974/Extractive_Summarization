by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 05:10 est , 12 july 2012 a mistake by an @entity3 employee was to blame for the sensational dna connection between the murder of @entity6 and the @entity8 movement , dashing hopes that after eight years her killer might finally be brought to justice			1
it was originally thought that @entity4 found on a padlock chain dropped during an @entity8 protest this year matched that discovered at the 2004 murder scene of the aspiring @entity18 actress			1
however it is now believed that a worker at either the police crime lab or @entity24 's office , who handled evidence in both cases , botched the job			2
several days later , her naked body was discovered in woodland with tulip petals arranged around it			1
although there was dna found on her pink cd player nearby , miss @entity47 's killer has never been found			1
on march 28 this year , @entity8 protesters poured into the @entity53 subway station in @entity54 , @entity55			2
they chained open emergency gates , taped up turnstiles and posted fliers , encouraging passengers to ride for free			0
the chain was left behind when the activists fled the station following the demonstration			0
police made no arrests following the incidents			0
the subway stop protest was made up of mainly @entity8 supporters along with workers from the @entity70 local 100 and the @entity71			0
brutal death : @entity18 student @entity6 , 21 , was running in a @entity40 park when she was pulled into the woods and strangled in 2004 csi : the path at @entity77 in @entity40 where miss @entity47 was strangled in 2004 @entity3 investigators announced earlier this week that crime scene dna from miss @entity6 's murder matched that found in the @entity83 subway station only months ago			1
however it has now been revealed that the potential clue was tainted evidence - embarrassing the @entity3 and enraging the @entity8 movement who took the opportunity to say the police should have made better use of their resources than collecting their dna			2
the only suspect in the @entity47 murder case was @entity95 , 47 , who has since moved to @entity96			0
he was never charged in connection with the murder of the young actress			0
@entity95 returned to the @entity100 last month , to share information he had received from a psychic as to who really killed the young woman			0
he remains a suspect but has penned a book about his experiences			0
miss @entity6 was a promising student studying at the prestigious @entity18 of performing arts at the time of her death			1
still out there : the connection between @entity4 found at an occupy protest and miss @entity6 's murder eight years ago proved to be a red herring view more videos at : @entity117 .			1
