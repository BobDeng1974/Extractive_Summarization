by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 16:13 est , 15 december 2012 disappointed : dr @entity1 , at @entity2 , sued for £ 20million after two smear tests failed to spot pre-cancerous cells a woman left unable to have children after a health board failed to spot her cancer has been awarded more than £ 2million in damages			1
@entity10 , 33 , claimed medical negligence ended her prospects of a high - flying career in the financial sector and will force her to use a surrogate mother to have children			1
but the money given to her for loss of earnings at the @entity2 fell far short of the £ 20million for which she had sued			1
in a written ruling issued yesterday , @entity22 rejected the physics graduate ’s claim that a lucrative career was a certainty before her two botched smear tests			1
instead , he said her chances of getting a top @entity31 job during the financial crash of 2008 were only 30 per cent			0
dr @entity10 was said to be ‘ disappointed ’ by the award			1
she is still seeking compensation from @entity35 and @entity36 to pay for a surrogate mother in the @entity38 after being forced to undergo a radical hysterectomy when her cancer was discovered two years too late			2
following the decision , she said : ‘ i am still working through the detail of what has been published today			0
‘ only someone who has suffered a serious cancer and the resulting treatment can truly appreciate the pain , fear and loss that come with it			2
‘ i was fortunate in that i survived , but i certainly had to fight hard to do so			0
this case is about protecting other women from an atrocious , preventable cancer and i will continue to do everything i can for them			0
' the 33 - year - old , who was born in @entity55 , @entity56 , had planned to have as many as four children – but was left unable to become a mother by a double medical blunder			1
she had two cervical smears in 2005 and 2006 , both of which failed to spot pre-cancerous cells			1
her eventual diagnosis came by accident after she graduated with a particle physics doctorate from @entity67 and moved to @entity68 to work for the @entity69 , @entity69			0
after cutting her hand , she discovered she had medical insurance and , as one of a number of medical checks , was given a smear test			2
the cancer was caught so late that she was forced to have radical surgery			2
her chances of survival during chemotherapy were given as just over 50 per cent , but she battled through – although she can no longer have children			0
then began a long - running legal fight to get the health board to take responsibility for this , ending in a judgment last year that it was to blame			2
dr @entity10 listened to four weeks of evidence earlier this year on her loss of earnings from the cancer , which she claims has left her with post- traumatic stress disorder and unable to work			1
giving evidence , she said she was on the point of getting her first job as a quantitative analyst with a top financial institution			0
she claims she would have made £ 15 - £ 20million over the course of her career			1
lord @entity22 ruled at @entity101 said the chances of dr @entity10 getting a top @entity31 job was just 30 per cent however , the written judgment revealed she had applied to 12 banks following her diagnosis and had been offered a job by none			1
moreover , there are only 600 such posts in @entity111 , with women filling only 7 per cent			0
these considerations led to the compensation figure being downgraded			0
lord @entity22 also said dr @entity10 was a woman who was ‘ driven , highly competitive , calculating , committed to getting on and highly focused ’ and that he believed she would find other work			1
taking into account her suffering , loss of earnings and pension , as well as plastic surgery to cover scars , she was awarded £ 2,026,750			1
that may increase following a further hearing on other financial matters			0
no date has yet been fixed for damages relating to her surrogacy treatment – which , if awarded , would be unprecedented in @entity130 courts			2
@entity131 , head of litigation at @entity133 , which represented dr @entity10 , said she was considering an appeal			2
he added : ‘ she was initially disappointed when she heard the headline figure			0
she put forward a case where her income would be £ 300,000 a year until the age of 55 and to be told her loss of earnings will be £ 1.7million is clearly a significant difference			1
‘ but the main thing for her has always been that other women should not have to go through this			0
’ a spokesman for @entity35 and @entity36 said yesterday that its legal team was still going through the 100 - page written judgment and that any further statement at this time would be ‘ inappropriate ’			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
