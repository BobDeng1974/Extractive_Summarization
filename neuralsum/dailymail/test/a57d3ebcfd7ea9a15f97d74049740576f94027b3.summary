in her working life , she has covered terrorist attacks , murders and explosions			0
but nothing , it seems , has been a greater challenge for @entity8 than a car journey with her three children			0
the @entity12 newsreader has revealed how an @entity14 holiday outing with her family saw ‘ blood and saliva flying ’ between her boisterous sons in the backseat – and ended with her six - year - old having a tooth knocked out			1
butter would n’t melt ! @entity8 and husband @entity23 with their children , two , four and six in a searingly honest account that plenty of exhausted parents will relate to , @entity26 , 42 , described how she took some time off work to spend with her children – but said the break turned into a string of tantrums and bickering			1
miss @entity8 is married to @entity23 , the owner of online auction business @entity36 , and the couple have a daughter aged two and sons aged four and six			0
describing a trip back from @entity43 to @entity44 , the newsreader wrote on her blog that four hours into a fraught journey , her six - year - old son started screaming			1
she said : ‘ i turned round to see blood and saliva flying towards me and all over [ the six - year - old ’s ] face			2
i started yelling in shock and shouted to the four - year - old , “ what have you done ? ” ‘ what he had done was knock one of his brother ’s teeth out ! how is that even possible ? ’ after ‘ one packet of wet wipes , a lot of blood and tears ’ , she wrote , the situation was calmer , and it was n’t long before her enterprising son was negotiating more money from the tooth fairy ‘ due to blood loss and trauma ’			1
honest : in her blog post , the @entity12 newsreader and mother - of - three also describes ‘ working mum guilt ’ the newsreader – who has worked for @entity78 and @entity79 as well as @entity12 – said she struggled to cope when the boys turned on each other in the car			1
‘ on their own they are all gorgeous – a delight – a pleasure ! together they are a ticking time bomb , ’ she wrote			1
‘ just how long before the first verbal or physical punch is thrown is anyone ’s guess			0
it is this – the dynamics of the three of them all together that i find the single hardest thing about being a parent … i feel unprepared and frustratingly un-forewarned of the trials and tribulations of dealing with my children en masse			0
’ in the post , which does not give her children ’s names , she also describes the ‘ working mum guilt ’ shared by many , and how she tries to squeeze in as many activities as possible during precious time off			1
‘ many would argue i do too much …			0
that may well be so , but i genuinely love our outings and seeing the joy and wonder on their faces , ’ she wrote			0
but the dream can quickly turn into a nightmare when ‘ their testosterone - fuelled little bodies means they can not keep their hands off each other for more than a few minutes at a time ’			2
she added : ‘ either kicking one another while sitting on the sofa , or wrestling around the house and taking it in turn to jump on each other ’s heads – our two - year - old daughter included			2
‘ pre parenthood , like many childless adults i would stare agog in the streets and in restaurants – at the out of control parent screaming at their equally out of control children … oh how easy it is to judge ! i am now that parent ! ’			0
