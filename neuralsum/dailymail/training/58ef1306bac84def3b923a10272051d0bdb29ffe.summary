there was a moment in the second half when @entity3 lost patience with @entity6 ’s dithering and cheekily dispossessed the @entity8 great on the edge of his own penalty area			1
the @entity12 flyer has not time for reputations , not when he is too busy building one all for himself			2
it was a fascinating contrast , with @entity6 switching the play at will with those tight balls around the corner and those cute little dummies			0
@entity3 is old - fashioned , always looking to run with the ball , targeting defenders and trying to exploit their weaknesses			1
the @entity12 forward , thrust into the no 10 role , did n’t deserve to be on the losing side			1
no time for reputations : @entity3 , here dispossessing @entity27 's @entity6 , was bold beyond his years all the tricks : @entity3 skips over the challenge of @entity30 in @entity12 's 2 - 1 loss he played as we knew he would , without inhibition or fear of failure in @entity12 ’s opening group game at a @entity37 in @entity38			1
it is one of the great shames , then , that this did n’t quite turn out to be his night after @entity44 ’s second half winner for @entity46 ’s side			1
his killer pass in the 37th minute took out four of the best defenders @entity27 has to offer at this tournament and ended up in the back of @entity53 ’s net			1
it was a joyous moment			0
there was a risk about @entity58 ’s decision to pick him from the start , but no - one could ever stand up and be taken seriously again if they said @entity12 ’s head coach got this wrong			1
@entity58 had the backing of the country on this one , even if it meant shifting @entity64 to the graveyard shift on the left and @entity67 to the right			0
everybody wants to see this 19 - year - old with the ball at his feet because he can pull off moves that vaporise the opposition			1
ghost goal : @entity3 's right - footed bullet hit the side netting but had everyone fooled for a moment danger man : the 19 - year - old wreaked havoc with his willingness to take on @entity27 's experienced defenders close quarters : @entity3 ( left ) in the second - man in as @entity27 's @entity44 ( centre ) holds off @entity64 all over the park : @entity3 's touches in the @entity37 opener against @entity27 in the opening minutes he flew past @entity90 before hitting the side netting with a powerful strike that many inside the stadium believed had gone in			1
there was an audacious little first half chip for @entity67 inside the area , the angled run at @entity99 that threatened to expose @entity27 ’s sluggish defence for pace again			2
before @entity3 had time to set up another attack , @entity27 had wised up to him and sent @entity103 to keep him company in the middle of the park			1
he still had too much for @entity103 when he set up @entity12 ’s equaliser , peeling off him to collect the ball midway into @entity27 ’s half			1
@entity3 was razor sharp , demanding the ball from senior players in this @entity12 side and trying to make a difference			1
when he was in possession he was rampant			0
he is an absolute menace to deal with , even when he was sent out to the right after the introduction of @entity116 midway through the second half			0
too quick : @entity118 grabs a handful of @entity3 's shirt as he 's beaten wide on the left side set up : @entity3 's piercing pass to @entity64 on the left was the catalyst for @entity12 's first - half equaliser there was a clamour for @entity3 ’s inclusion , most of it based on his electrifying performances during the build up to this tournament			1
@entity58 has been monitoring it over the past few weeks and has compared it to the demand for @entity64 to play in the opening game of @entity138 against @entity139			0
@entity64 was a kid of 17 them , scoring four times in the group stages before he was injured just 27 minutes into the quarter - final against @entity144			1
here in @entity146 the momentum is still with @entity3 after a performance of conviction and genuine class			1
tough stuff : @entity151 is out - muscled by teenager @entity3 in an at - times physical encounter he plays at speed , running at opponents in a way that we almost thought was lost to the modern game			1
it is exhilarating to watch			0
@entity3 carved open @entity27 ’s defence when he sent the ball out to @entity64 out on the left in the build up to @entity12 ’s first half equaliser			1
@entity64 delivered the sweetest touch from his left boot and soon enough @entity165 was performing that trademark dance in the @entity167			2
in the end it was n’t enough for @entity12 , but the country will see more from @entity3 in @entity171 on thursday when they face @entity173			1
with @entity176 in the side , there is still time to get back into this tournament			2
3rd @entity176 shoots and scores … does n’t he ? the @entity182 declare ‘ goal ’ , the fans cheer , the pubs celebrate … but his precocious drive from 25 yards swerves away from the goalkeeper ’s right hand , but somehow ends up in the side netting			2
it deserved to be a goal , but that ’s not the same			0
it ’s still 0 - 0			0
but the @entity8 now know he is there			0
4th @entity3 has started centrally and he ’s loving the space			2
but he loses the ball on the edge of the box as he gears up for a run , although it falls kindly for @entity12 and @entity202 forces a save with a long - range shot			1
@entity3 looks like he is making things happen			2
20th as @entity27 begin to get more possession , @entity12 rotate their forwards and @entity3 find himself on the left			1
he tries a dribble but runs in @entity211 and @entity27 break quickly			2
@entity64 is now inside , trying to get into the game			0
@entity213 creates space , beats the full - back and drives a low , hard cross into the six yard box with his weaker left foot			2
@entity67 fails to get on the end of it			0
the @entity182 studio , including @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 must have been groaning			0
a fox in the box would have scored from that chance and @entity3 ’s cross deserved a finish			1
@entity231 time and @entity232 is @entity12 ’s star of the show , according to @entity224 and @entity223			1
@entity223 has been campaigning for his inclusion all week			0
and the teenage @entity237 forward has n’t let anyone down			0
@entity176 starts the second half in the same care - free fashion , wriggling past two defenders on the left , but now the @entity8 know he is coming and they muscle him out with reinforcements			0
he then concedes the ball in centre - field too easily			2
@entity232 shows he is willing to chase after the ball and closes down @entity6 and retrieves the ball , before starting a counter attack , which may have resulted in a penalty after @entity67 is felled			0
the referee ignores the pleas			0
@entity251 tries to shoot as he appears on the edge of the box , but it ’s blocked by @entity151 as @entity27 become familiar with his threat			2
@entity151 , who has been involved in a struggle with @entity3 , is then removed to be replaced by the more defensive - minded @entity256			2
@entity257 is on the right … at times it seems like he is everywhere			0
he does look a menace with the ball and another dribble leads to an throw			0
@entity264 runs at two defenders and wins a corner			0
he wants the ball , he ’s hungry and he ’s dangerous			0
he ’s been @entity12 ’s best player and does n’t deserve to be on the losing side			1
can he conjure an equaliser ? @entity270 a dashing run into space , slicing through three defenders with his body movement and pace , @entity269 tries to find him and @entity27 are forced to concede another corner			0
92nd is shown a yellow card , taking one for the team as he break up an @entity27 counter-attack .			0

@entity12 lost their @entity37 group @entity284 opener 2 - 1 to @entity27 in @entity146
@entity286 opened the scoring on *35* minutes for @entity27
@entity3 's incisive pass in the 37th minute set up @entity165 's goal
the @entity12 star , thrust into @entity293 , did *n't* deserve to be in a losing side
@entity44 scored the winner with a back post header on 50 minutes
with the ball at his feet , @entity3 can pull of moves that vaporise opposition
