@entity1 fans will have the perfect opportunity on thursday night to see if @entity4 teenager @entity3 really is the answer to all their problems at @entity7			1
with @entity9 gone , @entity8 injured and @entity11 struggling badly , it is ironic that their £ 10million striker @entity12 will be in action against @entity15 in the @entity16 for his loan club @entity17			1
a goal or two will undoubtedly lead to calls from the @entity21 that he is brought back from @entity23 straight away to ease the @entity24 out of a mini-crisis following an embarrassing 3 - 0 home defeat against @entity27			2
video : scroll down to see @entity1 loan star @entity3 firing the goals in for @entity17 @entity30 international @entity3 signed for @entity32 ' men in june after an impressive @entity4 @entity12 celebrates scoring @entity17 's opening goal against @entity34 in his side 's @entity36 clash @entity12 ( left ) in action for @entity30 against @entity40 's @entity39 during the 1 - 1 draw between the sides in october @entity32 swooped for the 19 - year - old after he starred for @entity30 last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to @entity17 on a season - long loan to aid his development			1
officially , that is still written in stone though when a club as powerful as @entity1 are paying out millions of pounds , they usually find a way if they wanted @entity12 back earlier , possibly in january			1
former @entity7 striker @entity52 thinks they should but @entity15 manager @entity54 , whose side have the task of stopping @entity12 tonight , advises caution about rushing the 19 - year - old into the @entity59			1
@entity12 celebrates with @entity61 star @entity60 after he opened the scoring against @entity63 at the @entity4 @entity54 's @entity15 will look to limit @entity12 's influence for @entity17 in their @entity16 meeting ' you need to think about what the best step is to get a player ready for the @entity59			1
sometimes as a young player you need to play games and you need to play minutes , ' said the @entity15 boss			1
' remember that @entity12 did n't have many starts last season			2
he was more coming on as substitute , and slowly in the second half of the season he had a bigger role			0
so maybe he needed more starts before coming over			0
that is a strategy that has been put in place			0
' i do n't know the details surrounding the loan , but for me it 's not strange			0
' @entity12 ( left ) shields the ball from @entity88 during @entity30 's friendly against @entity89 in september @entity12 will come up against @entity90 for the first time since the keeper 's heroics against @entity30 in @entity94 you can see @entity54 's point of view			1
@entity1 's current predicament is borne out a perfect storm of losing @entity8 for two months with thigh and calf injures and the disastrous form of @entity11 and another summer signing @entity103			2
that does n't mean @entity12 is the answer either at this moment			0
he had an explosive @entity4 where his pace and movement shocked defenders			0
but towards the end of the tournament he was less effective , and has spoken himself of missing seven or eight chances against @entity90 when @entity30 played @entity114			1
@entity90 of course will be in @entity15 's goal against him tonight			2
this season , @entity12 has scored five goals to underline his potential , four for @entity17 and once for his country			2
and yet his overall form has blown hot and cold			0
he is inconsistent – something @entity1 do n't need			0
having said all that , if @entity12 does well against @entity15 , it may look odd to keep him in @entity23 while his parent club are struggling in front of goal			2
@entity54 , who has an encyclopedic knowledge of world football and was in @entity94 as a television summariser last summer , knows @entity12 's qualities			1
' @entity132 showed he is intelligent and has a real strong personality			0
he has got real pace and power , a striker that can play really well in wide areas and a real threat on the counter attack			0
' when he faces space he can be really dangerous			0
@entity12 can finish with both feet but is probably more right footed			0
i think he is someone that needs to be facing the space to be at his very best			0
' @entity1 fans do n't have to take @entity54 's words for it			1
they will be able to see @entity12 with their own eyes against their @entity150 rivals and whatever happens it 's unlikely he 'll be swapping shirts with an @entity15 player at half - time .			1

@entity1 loanee @entity3 will feature for @entity17 against @entity54 's @entity15 in the @entity16 on thursday night
@entity32 swooped for the 19 - year - old after he starred for @entity30 last summer but sent the *youngster* back to @entity17 to aid his development
former @entity7 striker @entity52 thinks @entity32 should bring @entity12 back to the @entity59
but @entity15 boss @entity54 thinks the striker should stay put
@entity12 set to face @entity90 again after @entity114 *goalkeeper* 's heroics against @entity30 at the @entity4
