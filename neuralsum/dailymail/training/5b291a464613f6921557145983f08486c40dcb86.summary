when @entity2 completes his coaching badges , the former @entity1 defender has it all mapped out			1
he wants the biggest job of the lot			1
this is his @entity1 dream ; a vision and a philosophy that he believes will get the best out of the country ’s players under his guidance			1
it feels good to hear someone care so much			2
‘ everyone has dreams of playing for @entity1 and my dream after football is to manage @entity1 , ’ he revealed			2
if i do n’t get a job in management i will wonder why			1
’ @entity2 started out on the coaching pathway when his career at @entity48 came to a close			1
it fills him with enthusiasm and now he wants more			2
to listen to him talk about the national team , to hear the passion in his voice , leaves you wanting to know more			2
‘ i will give myself the best opportunity of getting the job by getting all the badges , ’ he added			1
‘ i do n’t think people should start shouting the odds about the opportunity to manage clubs until they have their badges			1
i am not sitting here saying “ give me a job ” because i do n’t have them yet			2
’ fitting right in : ferdinand with @entity69 and sir @entity70 on the bench in @entity72 he is on the @entity74 licence course and the next step is the @entity76 and then the @entity77			0
after that , he can not be ignored			0
@entity2 , who turns 36 in november , has too much to offer after a lifetime in the game			1
he has experienced almost everything			2
he admires the young coaches ; the guys who were given a chance in their thirties			2
@entity2 believes they have a better connection with the dressing room			1
‘ low , @entity88 were young geezers when they started out with @entity90 , ’ he added			2
‘ look at @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 — they are not old fellas but they were given a chance			0
it is different in this country			0
we are 10 years behind in certain situations			0
we have to do what ’s best for @entity104 football			0
’ @entity2 has the bug for it			1
he would be a tracksuit manager , taking @entity1 ’s players through sessions as they prepare under a player who won 81 caps for his country during a distinguished international career			2
the old ones are n't always the best : a young @entity92 sprints down the @entity116 touchline in 2004 he speaks of radical changes needed with the national set - up , adapting the structure to suit an @entity1 team that would be encouraged to play @entity2 ’s way			1
after 50 years of failure , it has to be worth a shot			0
‘ maybe i ’m not their ( the @entity31 ’s ) type , but i do n’t know what their type is , ’ added @entity2			1
‘ maybe it ’s an unblemished track record , but everybody deserves a second chance			0
@entity131 is a prime example			0
he ’s the best one you had and he is gone , never to be seen again with @entity1			0
we are on our knees			0
’ @entity2 is talking about his eight - month ban from football after he missed a drugs test in 2003			1
it was an error , a bad one , but he has been the model professional ever since			0
‘ everybody deserves a second chance , ’ he says			0
this is a man who wants to take care of his country , to improve the players and make sure the future of the national team is secure			2
it has been a long time since anyone could say that			0
‘ it will take radical changes for things to happen with @entity1 and people ’s noses might be put out of joint but in the long run it will work , ’ he added			0
pepping them up : @entity93 ushered in an era of success at @entity163 after being appointed aged 37 ‘ i am speaking from a position of wanting to help			0
when you are a young player , making your way , you do n’t want to speak out because you are worried you might not get picked			2
but when you come out of the firing line , you can speak with experience			0
’ @entity2 sat on @entity31 chairman @entity170 ’s commission , providing some compelling arguments about the state of @entity104 football when he sat down to discuss the future of the national team			1
‘ bit left - field that one , ’ is his reaction to a question about @entity180 ’s claim last week that there is n’t much difference in the way @entity1 and @entity90 try to play			2
he is reluctant to answer at first , unaware of the comments after he had only just come off @entity186 ’s training pitch in west @entity187 as he prepared for the start of the @entity190 season			1
‘ i watched the games at the @entity192 and i did n’t see any likeness to @entity90 at all , ’ he added			0
‘ we see sparks from @entity196 , sparks from @entity197 and from @entity198 , but we play as individuals			0
they will not be able to fulfil their potential unless there is a structure and philosophy to aspire to			0
’ one day @entity2 hopes to be able to put it all in place			1
lowering the age : @entity192 - winning coach @entity207 was in his thirties when he became @entity90 boss in 2007 , as was his predecessor @entity88 ( left ) he has the ideas , as well as the experience after playing career that took him to the very top			1
with his profile , along with his @entity1 career , the six @entity190 titles and the @entity217 in 2008 , he will command instant respect in the dressing room			1
he fears that young players in the @entity190 are earning too much , something @entity221 highlighted last week			1
‘ the incentive has gone , ’ claimed @entity2			1
‘ are you gong to do that extra set of doggies , or sprints ? you can be in the reserves and if you have £ 5,000 a week coming in you ’re thinking about what colour car you ’re going to get			0
‘ or you might be thinking what holiday you ’re going to send your mum and dad on or what shoes you ’re going to get			0
it is a different environment and i do n’t think it is the right environment			0
it is football and if you are given a lot of scope then you will do it			0
that is the way it is			0
maybe clubs or the @entity31 have to revert back a little bit to give them a bit more of a grounding			0
’ @entity2 is a traditionalist , one of the old school as he reflects on the days when he would sit on the bench alongside @entity252 as a teenager at @entity254			1
back then they still cleaned the first - team players ’ boots , keeping their head down and driving to training in beaten - up old @entity259 at the start of their careers			1
the best : @entity2 rates @entity131 ( left ) , now @entity186 first - team coach , as his best @entity1 boss ‘ when i got on the bench at @entity254 i thought it was an unbelievable achievement , ’ he added			1
me and @entity252 would sit there thinking , “ @entity268 ”			0
‘ we would go out there to do the warm up and people think that ’s nothing , but it is part of the experience and gets you accustomed to the surroundings			0
now those players do n’t get the chance			2
managers wo n’t play a 17 - year - old when they can play “ @entity283 ” or whoever , from wherever , because he has played 300 games and is 28 years old			1
that ’s just my view , but who is right and who is wrong ? ’ judging by this , @entity2 has already got it all figured out			1
@entity2 is an ambassador for @entity291 , who this season will show 38 @entity190 matches exclusively live plus top games from the @entity294 , @entity295 and live action from more top flight football leagues than any other @entity299 provider			1
still going : @entity2 joined @entity186 to see out his playing days in the @entity190 pedigree : @entity2 had a stellar career at @entity48 and wants to pass his ideas on as a manager international class : @entity2 won 81 caps for @entity1 during his stellar career no structure : @entity1 were a rabble at the @entity192 , picking up just one point talking a good game : @entity2 is a pundit for @entity291 this season			1

@entity2 wants the top job after completing his coaching badges
the *35* - year - old defender has experienced almost everything after a lifetime in the game
he fears that young players in the @entity190 are earning too much
