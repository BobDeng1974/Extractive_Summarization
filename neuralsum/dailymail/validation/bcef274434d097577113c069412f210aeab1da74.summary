three police officers have been questioned as part of an investigation into the suspicious death of 13 - month - old @entity5 @entity4 three police officers have been questioned over alleged misconduct relating to the suspicious death of a 13 - month - old baby whose case has been shrouded in official secrecy			1
@entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , died in december 2012			1
but a draconian order imposed by judges has prevented any details of her death being revealed , despite a long - running police probe			1
during an inquest in october last year that lasted a mere seven minutes , a coroner simply ruled that the cause of @entity5 's death was ' unascertained ' and failed to disclose any other information			2
but it has now emerged that three officers from @entity27 have been questioned under caution over misconduct allegations			2
it can also be revealed that one officer , who was suspended after concerns that the force did not respond ‘ properly and appropriately ’ to the girl 's death , has since retired from the force			1
the news comes after the police watchdog , the @entity37 , said it would be investigating whether opportunities to obtain ' key evidence ' were ' identified and appropriately acted upon '			1
the @entity37 said it received a referral from @entity27 on june 27 last year and began its independent investigation on july 2			0
the body has since spoken to 13 witnesses and three police officers , who have been interviewed under caution			1
but the watchdog refused to disclose a copy of the @entity27 referral , which gives details of the exact allegations under investigation			2
a spokesman said the public interest in openness and transparency is ' outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations '			0
after @entity5 's death , a far - reaching injunction prevented the media from revealing various details about the case , including the hospital in which she died			2
the opening of the inquest in also took place in private			0
according to coroners ' rules , inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved			0
but following a challenge by media groups , the senior coroner for @entity13 , @entity78 , wrote to the attorney general to ask for a new hearing			2
lawyers representing several newspaper groups - @entity84 , which publishes @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 - had written to mr @entity78 to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful			0
one officer , who was suspended over allegations the force did not response ' properly ' to the young girl 's death , has also since retired from the force			1
@entity13 police is being investigated by the police watchdog in a written reply to law firm @entity98 , mr @entity78 , said : ' my own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place , not least so that conclusions as to how , when and where @entity104 came by her death can be recorded			1
the @entity37 probe is being overseen by senior investigator @entity108 and commissioner @entity109 ( pictured ) ' neither i nor mr @entity110 has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the @entity114			0
however , it is open to me to seek a fiat ( order ) from the attorney general to pursue an application under section 13 of the @entity121 for an order that a fresh inquest is to be held and i will now be doing so			0
' the police investigation had led to the arrest of two people , including @entity5 's father @entity127 , 46			0
last week it emerged the 46 - year - old and a 30 - year - old woman arrested will not face further action			0
the @entity37 probe is being overseen by senior investigator @entity108 and commissioner @entity109			0
in a statement , an @entity37 spokesman said : ' we are independently investigating the force 's response to @entity5 's death - whether its investigation was conducted thoroughly and appropriately and whether investigative opportunities to obtain key evidence in the investigation were identified and appropriately acted upon			1
' @entity143 officer @entity142 said : ' enquiries by the police and the @entity37 into the concerns arising from the circumstances of @entity104 's death , including criminal matters relating to members of the public and issues of police conduct relating to @entity27 , are currently ongoing			1
' he added : ' i have concluded the public interest in openness and transparency is at this stage outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations and the inquest and in maintaining confidence in the @entity37 's law enforcement functions more generally			0
