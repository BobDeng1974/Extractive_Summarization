@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 all had famously short lived marriages			1
although the duration of their relationships , which lasted from a matter of days to just a few months , may be shocking , the reasons for their splits come as no surprise - unlike the ream of depressing admissions submitted to @entity12			1
