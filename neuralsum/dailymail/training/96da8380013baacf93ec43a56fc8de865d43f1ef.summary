@entity1 academics are calling for a scientific probe into claims of a ' @entity5 @entity4 ' in one of the world 's remotest lakes			1
researchers using underwater scanners have found evidence of ' @entity12 ' - measuring up to 33 feet in length - in the deep waters of @entity14 , says a new report			1
intriguingly , the evidence is at a lake where native @entity19 and @entity20 people have long claimed an underwater creature lurks			1
proof : this photograph , said to be the head of the underwater beast , is being used as evidence to prove the existence of a @entity5 @entity29 monster the evidence includes a picture which , it is claimed , shows the monster , says the @entity33			1
known as ‘ the @entity36 ' , testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws			1
associate professor @entity38 , of @entity39 , told @entity40 that on her own scientific mission to @entity42 she recorded ‘ several seriously big underwater objects ’ with sonar readings			1
images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in ( 6.5 metres ) in length - were recorded on a @entity51 215 portable fish - finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet			1
territory : @entity14 in @entity5 , the alleged home of a giant ' @entity12 ' monster based on the sonic readings , researchers drew how the creature might look in real - life on the fish - finder 's screen			1
‘ it was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat , " said dr @entity38 of her own close encounter			1
it was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake			1
‘ the object was very dense , of homogeneous structure , surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish , and it was above the bottom , " she said			1
‘ i was very surprised but not scared nor shocked , after all we did not see this animal , we only registered a strange object in the water			1
but i can clearly say - at the moment , as a scientist , i can not offer you any explanation of what this object might be			2
’ lady in red : the echo device shows a mysterious shape and the scientists made a drawing , right in red , of what @entity4 's @entity1 cousin might look like @entity12 caught : the device , normally used to find and trace fish movements discovered a strange dense object in the lake artists impression : the scientists have made a drawing of a not - so - happy monster on the screen other similar findings since her 2002 mission mean that a new scientific mission to discover the truth is essential , said dr @entity38 , a biogeographer			1
‘ i believe there is a mystery in this lake because there is no smoke without fire , ’ she said			2
she was told an account of two fishermen who were ‘ in a 10 metre long boat when suddenly the bow began to rise as if somebody was pushing it from under the water			0
' it was a heavy boat , only a huge and strong animal can do such a thing			0
the fishermen were stuck by fear			0
they did not see anything , no head , no jaws			0
’ another ' sighting ' came when a group of @entity1 geologists were fishing in the lake			2
‘ suddenly those in the boat started screaming - apparently they saw a huge head of some creature			0
others , who were waiting for them on shore , started shooting , and scared the creature away , ’ said a witness			0
monster or myth ? : the local population have given testimonies on the monster they call ' the @entity36 ' since the 19th century a 1953 sighting of a ' monster ' in neighbouring @entity156 by respected @entity158 geologist @entity157 was initially covered up by the @entity158 authorities			2
but now dr @entity38 wants to investigate a theory that the two lakes are linked by underground tunnels			0
strangely , despite being close to @entity164 , the coldest inhabited town on @entity166 , the lake does not freeze completely in winter			2
there has been speculation in @entity1 that @entity42 and @entity169 might be inhabited by a school of ichthyosaurs , prehistoric marine reptiles resembling dolphins or sharks , or plesiosaurs , a popular theory concerning ' @entity4 ' in @entity177 which is often depicted with a long neck			0
another version is that relic killer whales could have become marooned in @entity42 when it was attached to the sea			0
some accounts even suggest the ' creature ' makes a hideous primeval cry as it attacks its prey			0
‘ personally , i do believe that when the information about something strange circulates among local people for so many years , it just ca n't be groundless , it means something is there , ’ said dr @entity38			0
’ i know the local people very well - they are ingenuous but they do not lie			0
’ she stressed : ‘ there are many lakes in @entity197 and around the @entity198 , hundreds of them , big and small , their shores are more or less populated , but all the talk is about @entity42 and @entity156 lakes , and it has gone on for many dozens of years			0
' it makes us think about it			0
and these stories about the local monster are older than those about the @entity4			2

giant underwater monster *rumoured* to be living in remote @entity5 lake
echo scanners found evidence of ' giant dense moving object ' measuring over *30* feet
