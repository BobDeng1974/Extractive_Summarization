a cynic might suspect @entity0 knew what he was doing			1
the interim @entity3 boss used a press conference to reveal that five @entity6 loan players shipped north on a @entity8 truck must play if they are fit			1
a coach who wanted the @entity11 job on a permanent basis would be unwise to detonate a bomb under @entity14			1
he is playing out time			2
he began a 12 - month notice period last month and the suspicion is he would be less than devastated if what he said on thursday was taken the wrong way			2
if they pay him off now , he ’ll cope			0
@entity21 football thought it had seen the last of this stuff when @entity23 , the erstwhile king of @entity24 , was detained by the @entity26 authorities			0
@entity6 have loaned @entity27 ( left ) @entity28 ( centre ) and @entity30 to @entity3 but @entity31 has merely given way to @entity33 , the de facto banker of @entity3 who has now purchased the right to use one of @entity37 ’s biggest football clubs as a real life version of @entity39			1
@entity3 , in essence , have become a nursery club for @entity6			1
a vehicle for enhancing the fitness of loan quintet @entity30 from @entity45 , @entity47 defender @entity46 , @entity48 - born @entity27 , @entity50 defender @entity49 and @entity52 winger @entity51			0
for the @entity37 , currently investigating alleged breaches of dual interest rules at @entity11 , the charge sheet is growing ahead of a hearing next month			1
‘ as far as i ’ve been told , providing they are fit , the boys will play in the team and i ’ll carry that instruction out , ’ @entity0 revealed			1
‘ in terms of once the game has started , i will make substitutions as i see fit			0
@entity3 caretaker boss has confirmed that he must play the five @entity6 loan players in the first team ‘ it ’s a slightly unenviable situation for the boys who ’ve come in			1
but let ’s not forget these boys have come from @entity6 , so they ’ll be good players and it ’s a good addition to our squad			1
it can be a positive , absolutely , and you ’d hope that other people will get a lift from it			0
’ recruiting five promising players from @entity6 , an established @entity79 club , could prove no bad thing			1
against @entity81 last weekend , @entity3 were pitiful ; a @entity83 shorn of their locks			1
the loan players — two defenders , two midfielders and an attacker — have the capacity to make the team better , starting with sunday ’s @entity92 game against @entity93			2
the problem lies in the principle			0
the idea that a shareholder with 8.92 per cent of the club , heavily securitised loans and the club ’s commercial valuables safely under lock and key can also dictate five of the starting places in the @entity3 first team			1
irrespective of form or ability			0
whatever they say publicly , existing players will welcome the newcomers with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for a tax bill			2
@entity6 owner @entity14 faces a hearing with the @entity37 over his involvement with @entity3 ‘ i ca n’t answer for the other players in the dressing room , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ but i would hope that they would be professional and continue to work hard in training			1
‘ the new boys are settling in fine			0
they are nice lads , i met them on wednesday			0
two of them trained on the first day and the other fit one will train today			0
they took part in the session and did fine			0
‘ all the players here have to just accept that ’s what happens at big clubs			2
players come in — but they have to continue to work hard			2
‘ if i have to tell a player that i ca n’t pick him , that ’s just where it ’s at			0
they have to be professional			0
’ under the rules set down by @entity14 and @entity137 , only three of the five are likely to play against @entity93			1
@entity51 and @entity49 remain a few weeks away from full fitness and have yet to arrive in @entity139			0
they are not completely unknown to @entity0			1
‘ @entity141 and @entity142 ( @entity143 ) went down in november to watch a @entity6 reserve game in which two of the boys played , ’ he revealed			1
‘ but in terms of deciding which ones were coming in , i spoke with @entity137 about a month ago and he made me aware that he was trying to bring players in and it could possibly be five coming up			2
’ with @entity6 players now moving to @entity3 on loan , @entity14 's interest in the club continues to grow @entity30 , @entity155 and @entity28 can — and will — play on sunday			1
that the man ostensibly known as the manager has barely seen them play is neither here nor there			2
‘ all i will say is that the more i see of the boys on the training field , the more i can get working with them , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i would like to think that would help			0
but they play with @entity6 , so they are good players — let ’s not forget that			1
’ the players , like the manager , have been placed in an unenviable situation			2
for a coach in normal circumstances , all of this would be intolerable			0
rangers prepare for their @entity92 fifth round clash with @entity93 @entity3 new loan signings @entity30 , @entity28 and @entity27 in training at @entity179 agreeing to provide cover until the end of the season after @entity143 was placed on gardening leave , however , @entity0 ’s terms and conditions were made clear			1
players coming and going were none of his business			2
he probably expected , as we all did , that he would follow @entity143 onto the allotment soon enough			0
it ’s far from impossible his revelations will force the issue , despite reiterating his commitment to his professional duties			0
‘ i have intimated i am working my notice , but every time i pick a team to go out there i want to win for @entity3			1
‘ it ’s been tough , but i am trying to get on with things as best i can			0
keep the boys upbeat and try to win football matches			0
that ’s what my job is			0
‘ twelve months notice i am working and that ’s me			0
’ he did n’t quite slap his thighs in relief , but the thought might have crossed his mind			0
where the @entity3 circus is concerned , every man has his limits			1
@entity27 : the 21 - year - old has made 26 appearances for @entity6 since arriving from @entity218 in 2012 for £ 1m			1
after impressing during his first season , the @entity48 - born midfielder - likened to @entity221 - has failed to progress and was soon demoted to the reserves			2
@entity30 : the playmaker joined @entity6 from @entity224 in 2009 - after they beat off competition from @entity226 - but he has struggled with injuries , damaging his knee and ankle ligaments in one match for @entity231			1
he has previously been loaned out to @entity232 and @entity233			2
@entity49 : the 19 - year - old @entity50 defender joined @entity6 's academy in january , 2013 but is yet to make an appearance for the first team			1
@entity28 : @entity47 centre back @entity28 is a product of the club 's youth system and joined them as a 13 - year - old			0
he was loaned to @entity245 earlier this season			1
he was highly - rated all through his progression at the academy but now looks set to leave the club in the summer			0
@entity51 : @entity52 winger @entity51 has made 30 appearances for @entity6 and , under @entity252 , enjoyed a run in the side in 2012			2
he lost his place , however , and has n't featured for the first team in nearly two years			0
he also has 18 senior caps for his country .			0

rangers have loaned five players from @entity6 until end of the season
@entity0 has been given specific instructions to play them
@entity6 owner @entity14 has an 8.92 per cent stake in @entity3
he is facing a hearing with the @entity37 over his involvement at @entity11
