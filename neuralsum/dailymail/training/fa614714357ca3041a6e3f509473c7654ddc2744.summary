by @entity1 reporter published : 07:30 est , 16 april 2012 updated : 09:46 est , 16 april 2012 an @entity3 millionaire who claimed he had given everything he owned to the poor because it never made him happy , has been exposed as a conman who simply wanted to get publicity to sell his house and cover his debts			1
media around the world rushed to cover the story of @entity14 when he revealed how he had liquidated everything and had invested the money in a bank to provide micro-financing to people in developing countries			1
he said he realised money did not make him happy and added : ' i was dying through consumerism			2
my cars and my plane have already gone – the rest will follow soon			2
' conman : @entity28 claimed to have given his entire fortune to the poor but an investigation by a leading @entity33 magazine claims it is a scam he had moved into a small alpine hut and planned to live on just a few hundred pounds a month			1
a @entity36 search on his name comes up with 500,000 hits			2
but now a special investigation by respected @entity33 magazine @entity41 has revealed how the 49 - year - old had actually hired three top public relations agencies to get his message of philanthropy around the world			1
@entity14 has since travelled the world for two years preaching his message of philanthropy as a guest on talkshows and other media - even writing a book with the title ' only people with nothing have everything to give '			1
the magazine claimed that his promises have not been kept and in reality the whole scheme was a pr stunt designed to allow the financially struggling businessmen to sell off his @entity3 property via a lottery so he could pay his debts			1
the public relations material sent out in march 2009 from the @entity69 firms had the headline ' win a @entity71 and at the @entity72			1
' property experts say the luxury @entity75 villa was probably not worth over 500,000 , but by selling tickets and the massive exposure the plan attracted he had managed to sell 21,999 tickets for € 99 each raising 1.78 million pounds			1
the winner – a woman from @entity83 – was announced in august 2010 and handed the keys			2
the magazine said that the money certainly gone to good use – but not for good causes			1
it said that in fact the only confirmed payment to a good cause had been a payment of € 14,886.20 that have been paid to the @entity3 charity light in @entity95 and @entity96 – representing just 0.7 percent of the total raised			1
the @entity69 companies that organised the stunt as well as lawyers pocketed € 643,000 while another € 745,000 went to pay off the mortgage			1
the property also has a debt tied into the deeds of another € 890,000 from the part share he still had in his firm			2
the magazine said @entity14 had earlier run up massive debts ' living a champagne lifestyle ' on the money that he got from the partial share in 2004 of his company selling living room accessories			1
at the time he was 42 years old and had regarded himself as officially in early retirement , and had purchased a second house in the @entity118 - and speculated on the stock exchange			1
scam : the raffle to sell the stunning home raised £ 1.78 million but the investigation by @entity41 found only € 14,886.20 , 0.7 per cent , was paid to the @entity3 charity light in @entity95 and @entity96 but with the crash in 2007 @entity14 lost vast amounts of money and tried at that time without success to sell his villa in @entity75			1
desperate for money – he had been forced to sell his villa in the @entity118 at a substantial loss			0
by september 2010 after the successful sale of the @entity75 villa on the backs of massive publicity he had been able to avoid the insolvency of the remainder of his firm that he had not sold by coming to an arrangement with creditor banks to personally take over € 510,000 of debt			0
contacted by @entity41 and asked if money from the sale of the house had been used for creditors he said no. asked where the money then come from he said : ' i had a few savings elsewhere			1
' when pushed he failed to provide any documents			0
today he makes his money from seminars and talkshows , cashing in on his fame as a philanthropist			0
media travelled to interview him , photograph and film him at the wooden hut he supposedly lives in on an alpine meadow – but when @entity41 visited the property they found no sign of him			0
they said that the hut was not usable in the winter and had clearly not been lived in over winter			0
they also found evidence that the property had occasionally been rented out in the summer when he was supposed to have been living there as well			0
also under @entity3 law – all residents in the country have to register their address			0
but he is not registered anywhere in the country – and in fact his last recorded contact address was a post box at the @entity180 , a 202 metre high tower block in the centre of the @entity3 capital			0
asked how true his statement had been of investing everything he owned in micro-credits in @entity188 countries he refused to put an amount down on the table			1
he said : ' i do n't want to state a sum			0
i will simply refer you to my original statement that i have given everything that i have			0
' but @entity41 pointed out that this could be nothing			0
his association @entity197 ( @entity198 ) still exists , but no proof that any money has gone there			0
his online internet platform has been in existence for two years ( www.mymicrocredit.org ) and has been gathering investment from private ' social investors ' offering interest - free miniature loans			0
@entity41 said that many private investors and also invested large sums of money with no strings attached including the publishing house that had printed his book			1
the magazine adds however that accounts which even an amateur football club has to prepare in @entity3 have never been filed for the company			2
@entity3 tax expert professor @entity217 from the @entity218 said that failing to file accounts was not an offence			0
when questioned by the magazine he said he had never added it all together because he had too little time			2
but he admitted there were thousands of social investors that had probably invested a few hundred thousand @entity227			2
discrepancies : although the house was n't valued at more than € 500,000 , the pr companies and lawyers that organised the raffle pocketed € 643,000 while another € 745,000 went to pay off @entity14 's mortgage but the magazine said that the information it had showed very little of the money from the social investors had gone to the preferred end @entity188 countries where it had been promised			1
mmc partner in @entity241 , the microcredit company ' @entity242 ' said that they had n't seen any money from him for a long time			0
they said that they had forwarded on 541 applications for loans from people in @entity251 and that of these 423 had appeared on the mmc page as being approved			2
but in reality only 278 applications totalling $ 98,106 had actually been transferred up until june 2010			0
after that @entity14 stopped making payments even though he continued to collect money at least until the end of last year for the social projects he was claiming to promote			1
the company said it had tried in vain up until april last year to get at least the remaining $ 46,000 that had been promised but with out any result			0
he simply had not paid , claiming to have had problems with @entity33 civil servants			0
he said he needed to change the legal form the company had in order to get round the legal issues that had been raised but when questioned @entity33 officials rejected that there had been any difficulties			2
@entity271 said that the payment difficulties have meant that they had cancelled their working relationship with @entity14 in july last year			1
a member of the board of @entity271 told @entity41 : ' we had grave doubts about the way he was operating financial organisation			0

' struggling businessman ' @entity14 , 49 , said he invested £ *3m* to help people in developing countries
raised over £ 1.7m selling his house though ' @entity285 and at the @entity72 ' raffle
but @entity289 magazine claims entire scheme was just a pr stunt designed so he can pay off debts
