for the first time in half a century the @entity0 kissed the @entity2 in @entity3 this may , providing photographer @entity4 a glimpse into the past of an @entity8 continent untouched by man 's meddling			1
the river , which flows high up in the @entity12 of the @entity8 , winds its way 1,400 miles south			0
over the past hundred or so years its journey has been dammed and changed more than a dozen times to feed and irrigate cities across the @entity17			0
only 10 percent of the mighty river even reaches @entity3 , but this march , the @entity8 and @entity3 governments made the decision to unleash the @entity21 across the border and release billions of gallons into now dry riverbeds - restoring the @entity25 to life			1
restoration : its course has been altered many times over the past century - but in may the @entity0 reached the @entity2 off the coast of @entity3 for the first time in 50 years @entity33 and writer @entity34 decided to traverse the now restored artery on paddle boards , watching as the so - called ' pulse flow ' bored down the dusty riverbeds that once was the natural escape for the @entity0 as it made its way through @entity3			1
' over eight weeks , a 105,392 - acre - foot pulse flow of water — about 34 billion gallons — would pour through @entity21 and down the dry channel , ' wrote @entity34 in @entity44			2
' the idea was to mimic the dynamics of the @entity0 's historical spring flood , timed to coincide with the germination of willow and cottonwood seeds			2
' @entity51 was astounded by the success as ' it kissed the sea this spring thanks to the hard work of many who lifted the gates of the last of 12 major dams on the river to release an experimental pulse flow across the parched delta			0
opened : the @entity21 on the @entity0 is wide open , allowing river water to move due south down the historic river channel some 100 miles to the @entity2			1
typically , the dam gates are sealed tight diverting the last of the river into the @entity68 on the left of the image			0
once - in - a - lifetime : across the delta , people came out to see the rare sight - water in the @entity0			2
these children played in the shallows the entire time we stopped to eat a snack during the first @entity80 crossing of the delta			0
damming the @entity0 with their butts : members of @entity85 expedition shore up the @entity0 pulse with their backsides for their own amusement in @entity3 never - seen - before : @entity89 - by marvel at water in the @entity0 at the last major bridge in the delta roughly 50 miles from the sea			1
return of nature : within hours of water reaching the community of @entity99 , just over the @entity8 / @entity3 border , fisherman were reeling in carp and more journey : members of @entity33 's team paddling the crest of the historic 2014 pulse flow across the dry @entity25 55 miles below the @entity21			1
the pulse flow was part of a bi-national agreement for restoration ' it was temporary and puny in the scheme of things - less than 1 % of the river - but magical as it showed the world how we can restore natural habitats if we try			0
' the goal was to not only restore the river , but native vegetation and fisheries which ultimately restore us , too			0
' enough water to supply over 200,000 homes for a year was released on march 23 in an effort to revive trees , wildlife and aquatic life that have perished since the delta dried up decades ago			0
conservationists say it 'll be years before they see the environmental effects of the water streaming through , but residents in the town of @entity0 in the @entity3 state of @entity136 have frolicked in the water and marveled at the river when the flow started			1
get ready : the gates of the @entity21 dam are typically closed but were opened for a historic pulse flow moving its way across the dry @entity25 @entity143 crosses water in what is normal a dry riverbed wednesday , march 26 , 2014 , in @entity0 , @entity3 @entity3 cowboys celebrated the 2014 historic pulse flow of @entity25 with laughter , galloping and even dancing horses			1
team paddle - board : ( l - r ) @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity34 , @entity157 -- during the 2014 pulse flow it 's a feat that the water released in march continued to flow through to may , said @entity161 , a spokeswoman for the @entity162			1
@entity161 has said that the success of the project will inform future collaborations between the @entity8 and @entity3			0
' it 's been very exciting for all of us to track the pulse flow as it has moved downstream to parts of the @entity0 channel that have been dry for years			2
to say that we reconnected the river with the sea is especially gratifying , ' said @entity174 , @entity8 commissioner of the @entity162 .			0

photographer @entity153 followed the @entity0 as its *original* course was restored for the first time in 50 years
in march , @entity3 's @entity21 unleashed billions of gallons of water allowing the river to flow to the coast
the photographer and an expedition team paddle boarded the rivers old route
