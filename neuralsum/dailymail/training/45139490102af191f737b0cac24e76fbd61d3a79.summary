by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:23 est , 26 february 2014 convicted @entity4 member @entity3 , 62 , walked free from court after it emerged he was one of 187 terror suspects who have a letter giving immunity from prosecution the secret deal that let suspected @entity11 bomber @entity3 walk free from court means that 187 @entity4 terror suspects will now be off the hook , too			1
@entity3 was just one of 200 suspected terrorists , known as ' on the runs ' or @entity17 , sent a letter guaranteeing that they would not face arrest or have to stand trial if they returned to the @entity23			1
other high - profile terrorism suspects thought likely to have similar letters include @entity27 escapees and three @entity4 members wanted in connection with murders of @entity23 soldiers			1
today prime minister @entity32 described the actions that led to the collapse of the @entity3 trial as a ' dreadful mistake ' , while @entity38 first minister @entity37 indicated he was prepared to resign unless there was a judicial inquiry into the trial 's collapse			1
he said : ' i have to say quite frankly that i am not prepared to be the first minister of a government that is kept in the dark on matters that are relevant to what we are doing			0
' meanwhile attorney general @entity50 stood by his decision to allow the prosecution to go ahead in the first place and said the allegations faced by @entity3 were ' of the utmost seriousness '			2

the @entity64 heard how @entity61 , the then @entity38 secretary @entity65 , and @entity62 leader @entity66 conducted secret negotiations to deal with the @entity17 - an issue said to be a crucial stumbling block to the decommissioning of weapons			1
under the project known as ' the administrative scheme ' , an estimated 200 suspected @entity4 fugitives were sent letters by the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) assuring them they were free from potential prosecution , despite there being outstanding warrants against them			1
the court judgement revealed that in 2000 there were an estimated 200 on the runs , and allowing for those who have died in the 14 years since , it suggests that possibly every @entity4 member on the run has a letter like @entity3 's , which he received in 2007			1
@entity62 politician @entity90 told the @entity64 in @entity3 's trial : ' it is impossible to overstate the importance of the assurances given to the 187 recipients , which included @entity3 , being maintained			1
' these were essential in the achievement of the series of agreements that began with the @entity101 in 1998 , and were consolidated in ... the commencement of the @entity103 in 2007 ' , the @entity97 reported			2
@entity3 , a convicted member of the @entity4 , was on the list of @entity17 because of his suspected involvement in the 1982 @entity11 bombing that killed four @entity108 soldiers and four horses and left 31 others injured			2

lieutenant @entity131 , 23 , @entity132 , 19 , lance corporal @entity133 , 19 , and squadron quartermaster corporal @entity134 , 36 , all of the @entity136 and @entity137 , died in the attack as they rode from their barracks at @entity139 to @entity140 when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails went off			0
other @entity4 fugitives likely to have been sent letters reassuring them they would not be prosecuted include @entity145 , @entity146 , and @entity147 , three of the ' @entity27 four ' who escaped from the notorious @entity27 in @entity38 in 1983			1
they fled to the @entity148 , from where they have resisted extradition attempts			0
in september 1983 38 prisoners broke out of the notorious @entity27 in @entity38 - some of those who are still on the run may be in possession of a letter giving them amnesty from prosecution victim : captain @entity160 of the @entity161 , pictured in beret , was murdered by the @entity4 in 1977 @entity62 general secretary @entity113 , who was arrested in @entity38 in 1972 for the attempted murder of @entity23 army officer @entity117 , has been on the run since fleeing when she was released on bail and is suggested as one of the highest profile people likely to have been given secret amnesty			1
and @entity169 and @entity170 , wanted in connection with the murder of @entity173 officer @entity160 in may 1977 , are also names believed to be on the list			2
captain @entity160 , 28,was abducted from a pub in @entity179 and killed by the provisional @entity4			0
his body has never been found but he was awarded the @entity181 posthumously in 1979			0
today a @entity62 spokesman refused to talk about the names of those who have letters of immunity and told @entity187 it was a ' personal issue '			2
he said : ' it 's a personal issue for those involved			0
i do n't want to be listening to any names			0
i do n't want to hear any names			0
' @entity195 ( @entity195 ) leader @entity194 , left , said the news about the secret amnesty revealed ' the rotten skulduggery behind the peace process ' , while attorney general @entity50 , right , who said he stood by his decision to prosecute @entity3 , was due to answer @entity202 questions on the collapsed trial this afternoon it emerged today that attorney general @entity50 would answer @entity202 ' questions after @entity3 's trial collapsed because of a blunder described by victims ' relatives as ' monumental '			1

in a written statement ahead of the @entity222 ' proceedings , mr @entity50 said : ' before he was charged my consent was sought , as the law requires , for him to face a charge of causing an explosion			0
' i believed then that it was right to do so and i remain of the same view today			0
' the allegations faced by mr @entity3 were of the utmost seriousness			0
the bombing was an attempt by the @entity4 to bring their terrorist campaign to @entity235 and to attack armed forces personnel who were on ceremonial duties			0
' whatever the circumstances in which the letter had been sent , and it is now clear that its assurances were wrongly given , it is right that the matter should be tested in court			0
' neither i nor the @entity244 were prepared to accept that the letter and the circumstances in which it had been given were such as to automatically prevent mr @entity3 's prosecution			2
' @entity38 first minister @entity37 said the collapse of @entity3 's trial yesterday was ' an outrage ' after news of the letters granting immunity emerged yesterday , relatives of the four soldiers killed in the 1982 @entity11 terror attack said in a statement : ' it is with great sadness and bitter disappointment that we have received the full and detailed judgement and that a trial will now not take place			1

' @entity38 chief constable @entity269 apologised to the families , saying : ' i deeply regret these failings , which should not have happened			0
' @entity103 first minister @entity37 said yesterday 's decision was ' an outrage ' , adding that it was ' a sad day for victims of terrorism ' , while @entity195 leader @entity194 said it showed ' the rotten skulduggery behind the peace process '			1
