the copy of @entity18 sold for over £ 40,000 - smashing the world record price for a book by the author			1
bidding frenzy : the dust jacket showing a picture of the @entity12 detective sold for over £ 40,000 - smashing the world record price for a book by the author pulling power : the 1924 dust jacket of @entity18 that drove auction bidders to distraction the 1924 edition was worth so much because it came with its dust jacket showing a picture of the @entity12 detective			1
collectors and dealers were frantically bidding for the collection of short stories that had a pre-sale estimate of £ 3,000 to £ 5,000			2
the image bears more than a passing resemblance to @entity44 as played by actor @entity45 and shows the famously egotistical detective wearing a morning suit with bow tie , spats and carrying his top hat and white gloves			0
the collection of @entity44 stories without its valuable dust cover when it was published , the book cost 7/6 - equivalent to 37.5 pence - but sold for a hammer price of £ 34,000 at auction			1
with premiums added on , the sum went up to £ 40,630			1
the previous record for a @entity2 book is believed to have been a copy of her first novel , @entity63			1
it sold in 2009 for £ 10,000 but has now been put into the shade by the sale at @entity68 near @entity69 , @entity70			1
@entity2 , who also wrote under the name @entity2 , died in 1976 having written more than 70 detective novels , most famously featuring her creations @entity44 and miss @entity74			2
@entity75 , from @entity77 auction house , said : ' we had a sense that this might happen , but it really took off			0
' every once in a while a rare and collectable first edition turns up in a dust wrapper that has never been seen on the open market before , or at least in living memory of the specialists			0
' this is one such book and while it may not be the first @entity44 book , it is the first to feature the detective ’s name in the title and the first to show a portrait of him			1
' the standing , confident figure that stares out at the reader is instantaneously recognisable to anyone familiar with @entity45 ’s portrayals			0
' @entity2 had previously published @entity44 books and the editor of @entity101 was a fan and commissioned some more			2
' they were later published and the sketch ’s image of @entity44 was used on the dust jacket			0
and the fact this had a dust jacket made it incredibly rare			0
separated at birth : @entity44 portrayed by @entity45 ( left ) and the sleuth on the 1924 book cover ( right ) ' there might be some others with the @entity2 family but for collectors this was probably the only chance they would have of owning one			1
' the dust jacket was a little bit chipped but was in a remarkable fresh condition			0
' most people would have probably thrown the dust jacket away after they bought the book , which is why there are so few left			0
' mr @entity129 , of @entity130 , said : ' it is very uncommon to find this in a dust wrapper and i know of only two others in existence			0
' i think i got it rather cheaply and would have paid a great deal more for it			0
' the book is uncommon in its own right as are all books by @entity2 before she moved to @entity143 in 1926			1
' it is quite a find and in very , very nice condition			0
' @entity2 , who also wrote under the name @entity2 , died in 1976 having written more than 70 detective novels , most famously featuring her creations @entity44 and miss @entity74			2
