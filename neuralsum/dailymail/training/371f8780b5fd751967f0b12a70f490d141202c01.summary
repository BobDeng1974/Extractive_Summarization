by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 05:54 est , 3 february 2013 @entity2 chairman @entity1 said flooding is getting worse because of a ' new kind of rain ' @entity7 's worsening floods are caused by a ' new kind of rain ' , according to the head of the @entity2			1
chairman lord @entity1 says changes in rain patterns mean parts of the country are being hit by prolonged downpours that are causing extreme flooding			1
thousands of homes and businesses were damaged and at least eight people were killed in 2012 as @entity7 suffered its second wettest year on record			2
lord @entity1 told the @entity23 that changes in the way it rains have contributed to the severe floods , in a claim reminiscent of @entity29 's ' wrong type of snow excuse '			1
he said : ' instead of rain sweeping across the country , we are getting convective rain , which sits in one place and just dumps itself in a deluge over a long period of time			1
‘ from the point of view of filling up the rivers and the drains , that it is quite severe			0
’ groundwater remains too high across @entity7 and further heavy rain could see more flooding			1
however , the record - breaking rain of the past 12 months means there is no chance of a drought in 2013			2
he told the @entity23 : ' if there was not another drop of rain for the whole of the rest of this year we would survive , but we would be seriously worried			0
' he said warnings of more extreme weather in the future means there is a ' constant ' need to improve defences			0
former culture secretary @entity1 was speaking 60 years after the @entity63 , which killed 307 people along the east coast			2
coastal towns and villages in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 were severely hit by the @entity74 storms			0
in @entity76 , @entity70 , alone about 13,000 people had to be evacuated and 59 people were killed			0
heavy floods hit many parts of the @entity7 last year , such as @entity80 , @entity81 , pictured , as the country suffered its second wettest year in history lord @entity1 said the country needs to be vigilant about flooding and defences must be upgraded in parts lord @entity1 said flood defences have improved dramatically since then and stand two metres higher than they did in 1953			1
however , he said with the country facing rising sea levels over the next 50 years , defences need constantly upgrading			0
despite these warnings the @entity2 has seen a 27 per cent funding cut since the @entity94 came to power in 2010			0
although , lord @entity1 said the severe weather of 2012 has pushed floods higher up the list of @entity100 priorities .			2

lord @entity1 said patterns in @entity7 have changed to ' convective ' rain
said rain now falls in prolonged downpours on parts of the country
no risk of drought in 2013 as groundwater levels remain too high
