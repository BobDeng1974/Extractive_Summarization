by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 04:09 est , 25 june 2012 he was that 12 - year - old boy in that red jumper tugging his cheeks on the cover of @entity7 's 1996 debut album			1
now @entity8 , an unemployed chef from @entity9 , @entity10 , is set to sue the @entity12 band for damages arguing that he never consented to the image being used			1
the 28 - year - old claims the album 's success caused him to be bullied at school and ostracised from his peers			1
he took a year out of school , eventually dropping out of his gcses as a result			2
iconic : wearing a baggy red jumper and pulling on his face , @entity8 's pose became iconic but he claims it led to him being bullied at school and ostracised from his peers in an interview with @entity28 , mr @entity8 said : ' what had happened was my brother had just passed away , and my cousin came up from @entity33 to see me			1
' he was a professional photographer , and he took some photographs of my family for his personal use			0
he brought up all his equipment and got me to do a few poses outside			0
' his cousin called mr @entity8 a month later to say he was going to be on the cover of a rock album , remarking : ' is n't that cool ? ' domino effect : mr @entity8 , who says he did not give his consent to be splashed on the band 's debut cover when he was 12 , is now an unemployed chef instead it turned mr @entity8 's life into a nightmare			1
the album sold phenomenally well and reached number five in the charts			0
mr @entity8 's face was everywhere			1
' it was in @entity54 , it was in @entity55 , it was in @entity56 , it was all over the place , ' he said			0
' i was watching @entity59 with my mum and i saw one of the billboards by the tube station and it had my face on there			0
' mr @entity8 , who had been popular at school , was teased by his classmates and slowly edged out			1
' nobody wanted me on their side or anything like that , ' he said			0
' even the teachers used to pull me aside and ask me about this cd cover			0
' in the end the bullying got so bad that mr @entity8 's mother had to drive him home from school every day so he could avoid the pupils waiting for him at the gates			1
not our fault : @entity7 's agents , @entity84 said that mr @entity8 's case should be directed against @entity54 , the label that put the album out , rather than the band ( pictured ) themselves he took a year out and then dropped out completely			1
mr @entity8 then trained as a chef but was made redundant in the recession			1
he claims the knock - on effect of the album cover disrupted his whole life and is now using his mother 's savings and scraping together every spare bit of money he has to file a lawsuit against @entity7 next month			1
the band 's agents , @entity84 told the @entity28 yesterday that mr @entity8 's case should be directed against @entity54 , the label that put the album out , rather than the band themselves			1
@entity7 went on to release five studio albums and sell more than 10 million records worldwide			0
@entity108 , @entity109 @entity110 had been a porn star when she starred on the cover of @entity108 's 1999 album			1

later she went to prison for four months for tax evasion and was reportedly in trouble last year for assaulting @entity113 again			0
@entity119 , @entity120 the preppy - looking girl on @entity119 's 2010 album is former model @entity123 in a @entity124 from 1983			1
the band loved the image but it came as a surprise to @entity123 who only discovered her face was being used after her daughter bought the album home			0
the then 53 - year - old who lives in @entity134 , sued photographer @entity135 and the band for $ 2million			0
the band later settled out of court			0
@entity139 , @entity140 the six children on the iconic 1973 @entity139 album shot on @entity143 , @entity144 , are actually just a collage of two siblings @entity147 and @entity148 who were five and seven at the time			0
now @entity147 is a cookery tv star , most notably for @entity153 's @entity152			2
he has admitted to finding the album 's artwork ' disturbing and haunting '			2
@entity157 , @entity156 knows i 'm @entity159 miserable looking @entity161 appeared on the cover of the @entity163 's 1984 single @entity160			2
