forget about the ' theory of everything ' , an even more important question has been put to professor @entity3 do you think is the cosmological effect of @entity5 leaving one direction ? the legendary physicist was speaking at the @entity8 as a 3d hologram from his physical location at @entity11 in the @entity12 , when the question was put to him			1
but it was a subject that professor @entity15 had his own theory on saying : ' finally , a question about something important			2
' my advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics			0
because one day there may well be proof of multiple universes , ' he said			0
professor @entity15 showed as well as a huge intellect he possesses a good sense of humour when @entity5 left @entity22 he broke the hearts of millions of teenage girls professor @entity15 joked that in another different universe ' @entity5 is still in @entity22 ' ' it would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies another different universe			1
' and in that universe , @entity5 is still in @entity22			2
' it got better still for the questioner as professor @entity15 went on to add that , ' this girl may like to know that in another possible universe , she and @entity5 are happily married '			1

i do nâ€™t think we will survive another 1,000 years without escaping beyond our fragile planet , ' @entity15 said .			0
