by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 19:15 est , 17 october 2012 a medical student was arrested and held for eight hours , had his fingerprints and @entity3 taken and his laptop and mobile phone seized – because a pair of £ 140 headphones he sold on @entity8 went missing in the post			2
@entity10 , 24 , spent seven weeks living in fear that a conviction would mean the end of his medical career before prosecutors dropped the case at the first court hearing			1
yesterday , mr @entity10 accused the police and prosecutors of a ' scandalous waste of resources ' and said he planned to sue @entity22 over his ordeal			1
suspect : @entity10 , 22 , was arrested when the headphones he sold on @entity8 did not reach their destination ' it was very stressful — a conviction could have spelled the end of my medical career before it has even begun			1
i have no previous convictions and i find it incredible how much money and resources have been wasted on this case – with @entity36 and @entity22 police involved , plus my £ 1,500 legal fees , paid for out of legal aid because i am a student			2
' why would i risk my five - year university course – which costs me around £ 8,000 a year in accommodation alone – to make just £ 140 ? why would i try to con someone ? ' the whole affair is ridiculous			0
i feel like the victim and i plan to sue the police for what they did			1
' mr @entity10 's ordeal began last may when he sold the beats by @entity49 headphones to a buyer from @entity36			1
the customer later told him they had not arrived and mr @entity53 , who is studying at @entity54 , offered a refund ' three or four times ' , on the understanding that he would be able to claim the value of the lost item back from @entity60 himself			2
' misunderstanding ' : @entity10 was charged with fraud , but he claims the headphones just got lost in the post he did not , however , alert the @entity60			1
the buyer refused to accept the offer and two months later two police officers arrived at mr @entity10 's family home in @entity69 , @entity70 , where he was revising for exams			1
he said they urged him to ' admit what you have done ' and that the matter could be resolved by paying back the buyer			0
mr @entity10 refused and was charged with fraud			1
his bank statements were seized along with his phone and computer			0
he said : ' police knocked on my door and told me the matter would be quickly dealt with if i just admitted i 'd taken the money and not sent the goods			0
@entity10 was arrested at his home in @entity69 , @entity22 ( file picture ) ' the buyer specifically declined the option of paying an extra £ 15 to have the headphones sent by special delivery because he only wanted to pay £ 5 for normal postage			1
' i 've sold hundreds of items in the past through @entity8 and never had a problem			0
i 've never ripped anyone off in my life			0
' mr @entity10 's ordeal only ended on september 10 , when he arrived at @entity70 magistrates ' court to be told that witnesses had declined to make a statement and that prosecutors considered the incident a civil rather than a criminal matter			2
however , his laptop – containing his coursework – and other belongings were not returned for another five weeks			0
a @entity111 spokesman said : ' following a review , it was decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction			0
' an @entity8 spokesman said it worked with law enforcement agencies when necessary			0
@entity60 spokesman @entity118 said : ' we would always encourage anyone sending items of value , or where confirmation of delivery is required , to use the appropriate tracked service			0

buyer said the @entity49 headphones never arrived , but ' ignored ' refund offer
@entity10 , 22 charged with fraud , but case thrown out at first hearing
now *threatening* to sue police for making him feel like ' a victim '
