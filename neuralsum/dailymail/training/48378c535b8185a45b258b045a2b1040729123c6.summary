forget @entity0 and his @entity3 - psychologists have come up with what may be the world 's most frustrating tongue twister			2
it may not make much sense , but the phrase ' pad kid poured curd pulled cold ' completely defeated volunteers taking part in a @entity15 speech study			1
asked to repeat the phrase 10 times at a fast lick , many of the participants clammed up and stopped talking altogether , according to lead researcher dr @entity21 , from @entity22 ( @entity22 ) in @entity23			1
@entity22 researchers in @entity23 found that certain combinations of sounds appear to make people lose control of their mouth			1
often , one sound seems to replace another			2
for instance , ' toy boat ' becomes ' toy boyt ' and ' top cop ' becomes ' cop cop ' ' if anyone can say this 10 times quickly , they get a prize , ' she said			2
the tongue twister study , presented at the annual meeting of the @entity42 in @entity43 , was conducted to shed light on the brain 's speech - planning processes			0
' when things go wrong , that can tell you something about how the typical , error - free operation should go , ' said dr @entity21			0
spoken too quickly , certain combinations of sounds appear to make people lose control of their mouths			1

psychologists have come up with what may be the world 's most frustrating tongue twister			0
it may not make much sense , but the phrase ' pad kid poured curd pulled cold ' completely defeated volunteers taking part in a @entity15 speech study researchers recorded misspoken sounds and analysed them to find mistakes could be subtle but when the researchers recorded misspoken sounds and analysed them they found that the mistakes could be more subtle			1
at least some of the time , tongue twister mix - ups were not one sound or another , but appeared to be something in between			0
in the ' top cop ' example , sometimes the ' t ' and ' c ' seemed to arrive at almost the same time ( ' t'kop ' ) and sometimes there was a delay between the two sounds with space for a vowel ( ' tah - kop ' )			1
the scientists studied two categories of tongue twister , simple lists of paired words , such as ' top cop ' and whole sentences			0
they found that in the word list tongue twisters there was a preponderance of ' t'kop ' type errors			1
in contrast , sentences produced more ' tah - kop ' mistakes that included a short vowel after the initial consonant			2
one possible clue to what is happening may be the regular rhythm of the word lists compared with the more irregular timing of the sentences , said dr @entity21			0
but there appeared to be some overlap in the processes used to produce both types of speech			0
the @entity22 team , working with colleagues in @entity117 , has already collected data from the next stage of the research , which involved placing tiny transducers on volunteers ' tongues to measure their articulation .			1

@entity22 researchers in @entity23 found that certain combinations of sounds appear to make people lose control of their mouths
they asked volunteers to say ' pad kid poured curd pulled cold ' repeatedly , which defeated most people taking part in the *experiment*
when the researchers recorded misspoken sounds and analysed them they found that mistakes could be subtle as well as *obvious*
