as well as a jail term , @entity43 could also face a fine of up to $ 10million			2
capital : the hillside community of @entity11 in @entity59 , also known as @entity60 hazardous : officers and workers wore masks and respirators to protect themselves from the harmful smoke burning : an armed guard watches as workers pile up the packets of the @entity9 drugs ready to set light to them this comes at a time as officials say the @entity42 is becoming a hot spot again for drug smuggling into the @entity46 as a new generation of ' @entity79 ' use speedboats to smuggle the drugs into the @entity46			1
about 14 per cent of @entity46 - bound cocaine shipments , roughly 42 tons , was trafficked through the @entity42 in the first six months of this year			2
the @entity12 is emerging as a hub of the burgeoning trade , according to the @entity83			0
that was double the share of @entity46 - bound cocaine that was shipped through the region during the first half of 2012 , @entity84 , special agent in charge of the @entity83 's @entity42 division , said			2
@entity92 - led traffickers are also taking advantage of a region where they made deep inroads in the 1980s , before drug lords in @entity97 began to dominate the trade by the late 1990s			1
in the last year , @entity46 law enforcement agencies have turned up the pressure on the @entity42 traffickers , with more @entity102 patrols , as well as well as human and electronic intelligence , to detect illicit planes and boats			0
a tidy sum : packets of cocaine are closely guarded by officials from the country 's police force while experts have been predicting a rise in @entity42 trafficking for years now , @entity84 said the evidence of an escalation was now unmistakable			2

stacked up : the huge seizure comes as experts say drug - smuggling in the @entity12 is on the rise the lure of @entity139 is its status as a @entity46 territory			1
once drugs are smuggled onto the island they can head right to the @entity46 mainland without going through customs			0
about 500 lbs of coca paste , the raw ingredient for refined cocaine , was recently seized from a laboratory on a ranch on the outskirts of the @entity12 capital recently			0
@entity12 authorities said it was the first full - scale cocaine processing operation ever uncovered in the @entity42			1
