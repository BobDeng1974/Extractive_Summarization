held to raise money for charity , both princes have made a habit of playing in the match , with the @entity54 refusing to miss it even when the birth of his son was imminent last year			1
the 11 - month - old even grabbed a polo stick in an attempt to join in the fun			2
when he was n’t exploring on his own , he held his mother ’s hand and toddled around the polo field , looking smart in his white polo shirt teamed with red and white striped dungarees and black shoes			2

this year 's event was a family affair with @entity1 giggling happily as his mother showed him the ropes and allowed him to grab on to a mallet while walking through the pony lines			2
@entity32 herself was typically stylish and wore her favourite @entity34 striped top with a pair of skinny dark blue jeans and a chic pair of beige and white loafers			2
beaming broadly , she smiled as proud father @entity59 , who was enjoying his first @entity130 , made his way over to his wife and child during a break in play , even giving @entity1 a slug of his water - much to the baby 's delight			1

last year , @entity186 was the scene of another triumph for the @entity171 , after her filly estimate romped home to take the prestigious @entity237 - much to the obvious delight of the monarch			2
