only just into november and the blooper of the season competition may have its unfortunate winner			0
on a night when @entity5 were challenged by owner @entity6 to prove their nine - match winless run really was just a ‘ blip ’ , the team found themselves two goals down by half - time			1
the first was dreadful defending which allowed @entity15 loanee @entity14 to give a penetrating run from @entity17 the finish it deserved after the @entity21 defender and @entity22 collided in the area			1
@entity24 ( second left ) celebrates after scoring from the penalty spot to put @entity21 3 - 0 up @entity5 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity26 5 ; @entity27 4 ( @entity28 , 32 mins , 4 ) 5 , @entity29 4 , @entity30 4 ( @entity31 , 45 mins , 5 ) , @entity32 5 ; @entity33 6 ; @entity34 5 , @entity35 6 , @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 ( @entity38 , 62 mins , 5 ) ; @entity39 6 subs not used : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44			1
@entity21 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity45 7 ; @entity17 8 ( @entity46 , 63 mins , 5 ) , @entity47 7 , @entity48 7 , @entity49 7 ; @entity50 7 , @entity51 7 ; @entity24 7 , @entity52 ( @entity53 , 60 mins , 5 ) , @entity54 7 ; @entity56 7 ( @entity55 , 75 mins ) subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61			1
the second , look away now @entity28 , was a tap - in from @entity56 courtesy of the weakest , shortest back pass imaginable			1
the defender had been on the pitch for all of three minutes and the touch could well have been his first			0
from such beginnings do crises develop and it is no exaggeration to say that @entity21 could have been another two goals to the good in the first 45 minutes			1
how @entity50 missed a sitter , only he will know			0
a couple of minutes into the second half and @entity29 ’s decision to up - end @entity56 resulted in @entity24 making it three from the penalty spot			1
even then @entity5 kept battling and @entity79 scored from long range near the end after @entity82 had been taken off on a stretcher leaving the home side with ten men			1
what had started as a promising opportunity to put things right was eventually a face - saving exercise			1
@entity5 's @entity37 hurdles a challenge by @entity21 defender @entity47 it would be fair to suggest the @entity94 owner is not a patient man			1
@entity96 is the fifth manager since the @entity6 family bought the club two years ago and four of those have been since @entity6 replaced cousin @entity101			1
the 10 - match unbeaten start seems a long time ago now			1
the owner wrote : ‘ i have been in @entity106 football long enough now to know one month does n’t make a season but i have also grown increasingly accustomed to the word “ blip ”			0
’ the conclusion to sentences like that in the past has been a quick farewell to the managerial incumbent , however popular the appointment in the first place			0
striker @entity56 ( right ) scored @entity21 's second goal of the night @entity96 , never one to shirk a decision , dropped nine - goal , £ 5.5million striker @entity121 to the bench			1
he arrived for the second half as the manager threw everything into a fight back which imploded with the penalty decision			0
but it is a leakage rate of 12 goals in five games before wednesday night which needs addressing urgently			2
there was plenty of decent , threatening build - up play from @entity5 without very much of an end product while every time @entity21 broke , panic			1
@entity138 ’s players have not been good travellers , three out of four away defeats before last night although they would have been buoyed by beating high - flying @entity140 last weekend			2
the opening goal was all down to @entity17 ’s surging run			0
referee @entity143 was spared the decision of whether @entity30 ’ block was a penalty as both players tumbled to the turf because the ball squirted to @entity14 , who scored			2
@entity82 was taken off on a stretcher to leave @entity5 down to 10 men @entity5 responded positively without forcing @entity45 into any real saves until the latter stages			1
he could do nothing when @entity39 let fly			0
but @entity96 ’s team always looked vulnerable on the break			2
interestingly @entity157 was sacrificed in the half - time reshuffle with @entity33 dropping into the back four from midfield			0
by that time , @entity28 had tapped the ball into @entity56 ’s path making the task almost impossible			2
the @entity164 player hung his head and was roundly booed but showed character to keep battling			0
any hopes of a comeback were dashed with @entity29 ’s challenge on @entity56 – a stonewall penalty			2
to the fans ’ credit , many stayed until the end			0
to the players ’ credit , they kept probing and did score			0
@entity96 finds himself under increasing pressure from @entity5 's @entity94 owners but this will go down as a very bad night at the office for @entity96 , and , by extension , @entity6			1
‘ i never fear failure , ’ said @entity96			2
‘ i care about the club and i feel i ’m part of the terrace culture			0
the chairman has been supportive of me and i ’m in the infancy of a job here , but , yes , we need a win			0
‘ tonight we made individual errors			0
that erodes the confidence of the team and decent players become nervous players			0
’ @entity21 boss @entity138 said : ‘ we saw the team sheet and we thought we could exploit the space			2

@entity14 , @entity56 and @entity24 put @entity21 3 - 0 up
@entity79 score late *consolation* for @entity5
@entity96 's side have not won in 10 games in all competitions
@entity5 slip down to 11th in @entity209 as @entity21 move up to *9th*
