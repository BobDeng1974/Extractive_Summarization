ahead of @entity3 's huge @entity2 semi-final showdown with hosts @entity4 in @entity6 , @entity0 takes a closer look at @entity9 's side			1
player of the tournament : @entity12 ( 5 games , 3 clean sheets ) the @entity16 stopper was already widely regarded as one of the finest keepers in the world , but this @entity2 has seen his stock rise even more			0
strings of fine saves combined with his adventurous sweeper keeper role have played a big role in helping @entity3 progress			0
billed as one of the biggest matches of the group stage , @entity41 ’s team had the game won at half - time after going 3 - 0 up before @entity47 completed a hat - trick in the second half			2
the demolition of a fierce group rival inside 45 minutes was enough to convince many that @entity3 were only heading for the latter stages ( again )			0
danger man : @entity47 scores his third goal of the game during @entity3 's convincing 4 - 0 win against @entity36 tournament lowlight : struggling past @entity58 but just when you thought @entity9 ’s team were shoe - ins for the quarter - finals they so nearly blew it in the last 16 against @entity58			1
expected to cruise past the @entity68 side , @entity3 ’s high defensive line was constantly exploited by the minnows who time and time again were fumbled by @entity12 – who was playing as a keeper , a centre - back and a right - back as he ridiculously charged out his goal at all costs to soak up one defensive error after another			1
@entity3 would eventually squeeze through 2 - 1 after extra time			0
hard work : @entity81 ( right ) and his team - mates struggled to make it past @entity58 in their last 16 tie best goal : @entity86 v @entity58 , 2 - 1 last 16 , @entity87 ( @entity88 ) there wo n’t be many @entity91 strikes in contender for winning goal of the tournament , but @entity86 ’s clever and instinctive back flick to turn home a low @entity47 ’s cross proved crucial in helping @entity3 break the deadlock against @entity58 in extra-time			1
classy finish : @entity86 flicks home @entity47 's cross in style to break the deadlock against @entity58 how has the boss performed ? @entity9 ’s starting to become part of the furniture in the @entity3 set - up having taken over from @entity110 in 2006 , and he has delivered a fourth straight major semi-final			2
only trophies will satisfy a side who have been potless since 1996 though , and while @entity3 are making progress , questions have been raised on his faith in deploying a sweeper keeper – a tactic which was dangerously close to back firing against @entity58			0
animated : @entity3 boss @entity41 is expected to take the @entity2 trophy with him when he returns home top scorer : @entity47 ( 4 goals ) killer stat : @entity3 are unbeaten against tournament hosts in their last eight matches in a @entity2 or @entity128 , since losing to @entity129 in the 1966 @entity2 final			2
results in 9pm kick - offs : played 1 , w 1 , d 0 , l 0 @entity135 v @entity134 : played on @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 1 , l 0 ; played on @entity134 , @entity136 , @entity137 0 , l 0 @entity138 to semi-finals : @entity141 winners ( beat @entity36 4 - 0 , drew 2 - 2 with @entity142 and beat @entity143 1 - 0 ) last 16 : 2 - 1 vs @entity58 ( @entity144 ) quarter - finals : 1 - 0 vs @entity147 @entity149 ranking : 2nd likely line - up : @entity12 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity81 , @entity156 , @entity47 , @entity157 , @entity158 @entity2 pedigree : winners in 1954 , 1974 and @entity160 in 1966 , 1982 , 1986 and 2002 , @entity161 in 1934 , 1958 , 1970 , 2006 , 2010			1
