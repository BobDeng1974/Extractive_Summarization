by @entity0 @entity1 believes he should be at this year 's @entity2 - but accepts he may have to do more to convince @entity4 captain @entity3			1
former world number one @entity1 is on the comeback trail after a three - month lay - off following a back operation			1
@entity10 ' appearance at the @entity11 at @entity12 this week was just his second since undergoing surgery in march			1
the 14 - time major winner had mixed fortunes on the @entity32 links , finishing six over after a three - under - par first - round 69			1
having fallen well down the standings for automatic @entity35 selection during his absence , he may be relying on being named as one of @entity3 's wildcard picks for the september match			1
asked if he should be selected , @entity1 said : ' i would say yes , but that 's my position , my take on it			1
" he 's the captain , obviously it 's his decision			2
he 's going to field the best 12 players that he thinks will win the cup back , and i hope i 'm on that team			1
' @entity10 has been a wildcard pick before , in 2010 when @entity49 added him to his side for the competition at @entity52			2
the 38 - year - old said : ' i got picked by @entity49 back in whenever it was when we played in @entity56			1
' i was coming off an injury as well there with my achilles , and i sat out for most of the summer			0
thinking : @entity10 eyes up a putt during the final round of the open championship improvement : @entity1 holds up the ball after putting out on the 13th green ' i felt like i was able to contribute to the team and that 's all you want as a pick , you want someone who can contribute to the team , whether it 's in support or it 's in play			1
' i did it then and hopefully i can actually earn my way on to this team			0
' @entity1 is confident he can do that in the most convincing fashion with outstanding performances in the coming weeks at the @entity81 - which he won last year - and the @entity82 at @entity83			1
he added : ' well , i 'd like to win the next two tournaments i 'm in			0
that should take care of that			0
' @entity10 ' final round at @entity12 included a double - bogey six at the seventh hole and four other bogeys			1
assessing his week on the @entity93 , he commented : ' i got four rounds in , unfortunately i did n't play very well today			0
' it was a little different on the first day , obviously , but i just made too many mistakes			2
i had two triples ( bogeys ) , two doubles			0
just way too many mistakes			0
' but the fact i was able to play a few weeks ahead of time , and i 'm only getting stronger and faster , is great			0
' woods , a triple @entity11 champion , finished five strokes behind 64 - year - old five - time winner @entity3 , who closed with an impressive 68			1
preparation : @entity1 gets ready for the 15th tee during the final round of the @entity11 with his caddie @entity110 straight faced : @entity1 walks off after finishing his final round during day four of the @entity112 @entity3 has said he will pick @entity10 for @entity35 if form and fitness warrants it , but will make no guarantees if he fails to make the play - offs for the @entity118			1
@entity3 had hoped to speak to @entity1 at some stage during their week at the @entity11 but that has not occurred			0
' i just said hello			0
we 're going to talk on the phone , ' said @entity3			0
' but it 's a little bit early with @entity1 to even talk to as far as where he is			2
where it needs to be is higher up on the list			0
' it looks like he 's playing without pain but , again , he 's not in the mix. ' he needed to get in the mix to get some points to get some money and get in the @entity118			2
that 's what i was hoping he was doing this week			2
' @entity140 is another high - profile @entity4 player currently outside automatic selection			2
' if @entity140 and @entity1 do n't make it in the mix there , i 've got some real thinking to do			0
' everybody is thinking that i 'm going to pick them automatically but i can assure you that i 'm not going to pick them automatically			0

the 38 - year - old ended six over par after a frustrating championship for him at @entity12
he finished three over par on the final day to *recover* some pride after *lethargic* showing
however he still feels he should be at this year 's @entity2
it was his first performance at a major since back surgery earlier this year
