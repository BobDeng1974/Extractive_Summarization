pigs have been blown up , guinea pigs poisoned and marmosets given anthrax in germ and chemical warfare experiments at the top secret @entity8 military research base , it has emerged			1
the campaign group that uncovered the details of the ' cruel and grotesque ' research projects by scientists at the @entity14 labs in @entity15 said that in some cases it appeared the animals had been given nothing to ease their pain			1
many of the experiments involved substantial suffering and led to the death of the animals , the @entity20 for @entity22 's investigation found			1
@entity28 mp @entity27 said he was shocked by the number of animal experiments being carried out at @entity14 in @entity15 every year the charity 's chief executive @entity31 said : ' although supporting the need to ensure the safety of soldiers and civilians in an increasingly dangerous world , the @entity33 is opposed to deliberately causing suffering and death to animals in such disturbing and cruel experiments			1
' we believe it is totally unacceptable to treat animals in this way			2
' the @entity47 , which last week was forced to explain experiments in which pigs are shot for military surgeons to operate on , said animal research is vital if it is to protect @entity8 and members of the @entity54 safe			1
the @entity33 highlighted six pieces of studies published in medical and scientific journals since 2010			0
some were funded by , or carried out in collaboration with , @entity61 defence agencies			0
in one of the most graphic experiments , pigs were blown up by bombs before being resuscitated			1
the researchers wanted to find out the best way to treat soldiers when there is a delay in evacuating them from the battlefield			0
highly dangerous bacteria and biological weapons were tested on marmosets , like the one pictured above campaigners say the military research on animals such as pigs is ' gruesome ' and any evidence it saves lives is ' questionable ' the animals were anesthetised and placed on trolleys eight feet away from explosives that were then detonated remotely			1
they were then drained of a third of their blood before being resuscitated			1
eleven of the 28 animals died , despite the researchers ' efforts			0
the researchers later wrote that the information they obtained will be of profound significance when treating wounded soldiers in the field			0
two other pig studies involved the animals being forced to inhale chemical warfare agents , including mustard gas			2
in research into anthrax , marmosets were infected with the highly dangerous bacterium which can be used as a biological weapon			1
@entity107 died and those that were still alive at the end of the experiment were killed and dissected			0
the @entity33 was unable to find any evidence that monkeys were given any sort of pain relief			0
a fifth experiment involved testing a treatment for @entity118 , a nerve agent and chemical weapon that causes fits , breathing difficulties , coma and eventually death			2
the poison was applied to the animals ' shaved backs before the treatment was injected into their muscles			0
eight died within the first two days and dissection revealed their guts had twisted			0
finally , scientists reaching a vaccine against bubonic plague injected mice with the bug behind the devastating disease			0
dr @entity139 , the @entity33 's senior scientific advisor , said : ' in addition to the ethical objections of using animals in such severe experiments , it is questionable that this type of research actually saves lives			1
this is because it is difficult to extrapolate findings from other animals to humans			0
' also , some of these experiments were attempting to replicate some of what we already know from human and other animal studies , which challenges the conviction that the high level of suffering inflicted upon these animals is justified			2
' an @entity163 spokesman said : ' animals too often pay the price of man 's inhumanity to man			0
the military should use and invest in alternative , non-animal training methods			0
' the @entity47 's @entity171 ( @entity172 ) at @entity14 said : ' dstl is proud of the research undertaken by its staff and believes that the remit to provide safe and effective protective measures for the @entity8 and its @entity54 could not , currently , be achieved without the use of animals			1
' a spokesman added that international collaborations cut the need for the duplication of animal experiments and all work is approved by the @entity185 , which also inspects the labs			2
' all the research projects that involve animals are licensed by the @entity185			1
as part of the licensing process , the researchers have to convince the @entity185 that the work is required , that the results can not be obtained without the use of animals and that every step has been taken to minimise pain and suffering to the animals involved			2
