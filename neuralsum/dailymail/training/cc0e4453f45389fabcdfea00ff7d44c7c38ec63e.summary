@entity0 can be revealed as the team who play least often during the saturday 3pm slot traditionally reserved for @entity5 football matches			1
spurs have kicked - off at that time in just seven out of 51 @entity7 games played since the start of the 2013 - 14 season , whereas @entity10 have played at that time on 31 occasions , the most of any top - flight team			1
@entity0 fans have also seen their team play just 14 of those games at any time on a saturday - again the lowest number in the @entity7			1
the club 's involvement in the @entity19 , which is played on thursday nights , can explain much of their absence from the saturday fixture list as clubs require three days ' rest following @entity26 fixtures			0
@entity27 ( second right ) celebrates scoring during @entity0 ' win over @entity29 - on a sunday , of course @entity10 were beaten by @entity31 at @entity32 in their most recent fixture , which kicked - off at 3pm on saturday @entity34 has investigated the kick - off times for each of the teams who have been in the top flight since the start of last season			1
the results are detailed in the tables below , where you can see on which days your club has played			0
@entity50 are the side who have played most often on a saturday , the day which was once reserved for the nation to watch their favourite team play			2
live broadcasting of @entity7 games has gradually eroded the number of matches which kick off at 3pm on saturdays			2
unsurprisingly it is the less fashionable teams which get closest to @entity10 's number of 31 kick - offs at that time			2
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 ( all 30 ) and @entity62 ( 29 ) have the next highest totals			0
@entity50 , who beat @entity65 on saturday , have played the most matches on that day in recent times @entity68 ( centre ) was unable to help @entity70 beat @entity71 on saturday 's evening kick - off of the established ' big four ' clubs - @entity74 , @entity70 , @entity31 and @entity76 - it is @entity78 's team which has played in the traditional slot the most with 13 , while the @entity80 played just nine games at that time			1
@entity31 and champions @entity83 top the list of teams who have played in the early kick - off on saturday at 12.45pm , with eight apiece			0
@entity70 are the team who most often played in the late 5.30pm kick - off , with nine			0
