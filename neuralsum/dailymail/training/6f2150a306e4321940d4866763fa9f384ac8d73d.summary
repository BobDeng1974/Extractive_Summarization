by @entity1 reporter published : 08:36 est , 30 april 2013 @entity3 : 08:47 est , 30 april 2013 an ex-royal @entity5 officer has claimed reports that he was heading to @entity7 to fight pirates are ' nonsense ' former lieutenant @entity11 ’s decommissioned gunboat defender raised suspicions among @entity14 authorities last week after he was forced to stop off in @entity15 for repairs			1
@entity18 officers have carried out five inspections of the vessel and have refused to allow the heavily armoured converted warship to sail			0
but mr @entity11 , 53 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , said the @entity14 authorities were making a ' fuss about nothing ' and said the cannons on his boat were ' just for show and totally unusable '			1
angry : @entity29 , 53 , said it was ' nonsense ' to suggest he was intending to use his boat to fight @entity7 pirates following background checks on mr @entity29 , the @entity14 authorities are believed to have been concerned by comments he made to a local newspaper in @entity36 in 2011 that he intended to arm it for shipping and oil rig protection			1
he told the @entity40 in november 2011 : ‘ defender ’s task will be to deter any pirates intent on boarding the many ships that pass the @entity46 coastline			2
one look at her should be enough to send them looking for easier targets			0
‘ she will be manned by handpicked @entity51 and run as a professional naval ship , obeying the rules of engagement			0
‘ our primary task will be to protect oil platforms which are towed close to the coast of @entity46 , and a number of oil companies want to hire defender to look after their interests			0
‘ we are not mercenaries ; this is strictly a business venture similar to other @entity66 private protection firms which operate in @entity67 and @entity68			0
’ but yesterday mr @entity29 told @entity69 it was a ' fuss about nothing ' and said the @entity14 authorities had gone ' totally overboard over nothing whatsoever			1
' he said : ‘ the reports of us heading to @entity7 are nonsense			1
we would not have come down this way if our destination was the @entity77			0
there are quicker routes to get there			0
‘ we are on our way from @entity82 to @entity83 to discuss with the authorities there the possible use of the defender as a deterrent against illegal fishing boats			2
' the idea is that one look at us and anyone who should not be fishing there will think twice about staying			0
‘ we have been searched from top to bottom and nothing improper has been found			0
the only reason we have to stay is because the inspectors say our on - board safety equipment is not up to standard			0
eight former @entity100 are understood to be on board the vessel , which was heading to @entity46 to protect oil platforms on the @entity46 coastline from pirates mr @entity29 said the cannons on his boat were ' just for show ' and ' totally unusable ' ‘ we need to get new fire extinguishers and some other items before we are cleared to depart			1
the crew have not been detained in any way			0
’ the 127ft boat , which weighs 135 tons , was built in @entity115 , @entity116 , in the mid-seventies as a fast attack craft for the sultan of @entity121 ’s navy in the @entity122			2
the ship was decommissioned in 2002			0
mr @entity11 is thought to have bought it two years ago			1
local maritime officials impounded the vessel last week after an inspection found ‘ administrative irregularities ’ and security issues relating to life - saving equipment			2
the drama began on tuesday , april 23 when the defender made an unplanned stopover in the resort of @entity135 after blowing a gasket			2
it was boarded by @entity18 officers and refused permission to stay there			0
the vessel was then escorted to a berth 50 miles away at @entity144 port by a @entity14 navy warship			1
officials are understood to have been suspicious that the formidable looking vessel , which flies the @entity66 flag , was registered as a pleasure boat			2
the boat has been inspected five times but officials have refused the skipper permission to sail			1
mr @entity11 and his five - man crew have not been held			1
mr @entity11 said yesterday that only he and one other crewman had served in the @entity156			1
the @entity14 ministry of defence said an inspection had revealed ‘ irregularities in the paperwork of the boat and its crew , as well as deficiencies in safety equipment ’ .			1

former gunboat has been stopped by @entity14 authorities near @entity15
it has been inspected five times in less than a week
@entity14 fear the boat may have been on its way to fight @entity7 pirates
but owner @entity11 claims cannons on boat are ' totally unusable '
he said @entity14 authorities had ' made a *big* fuss about nothing '
