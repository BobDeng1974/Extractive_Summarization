by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 02:51 est , 12 march 2014 a small @entity3 town has a very interesting rite of spring : every year thousands of male garter snakes emerge from their dens and pile onto the females in writhing ' mating balls ' dozens of snakes strong			1
the red - sided garter snakes of @entity12 winter together in mass pits where their incredible numbers make the sites the largest gatherings of snakes on the planet			1
when things warm up and the snakes get moving , the first thing on their minds is to mate -- and they do that en masse as well in a incredible , if stomach turning , display			0
they wait eagerly outside the dens by the thousands for the females to come out of their hibernation the best place to spot these mating balls is in the @entity39 of @entity12 , @entity3 , where the @entity40 took this stunning footage of the event			2
each year , the smaller males emerge first from their caves when warmth finally comes to the @entity3 plains			0
they wait by the thousands outside the dens until slowly and just by ones and twos , the significantly larger females emerge			0
no time to lose : once the females slowly start to emerge , the males pounce clamoring males pursue a female by the dozens scent of a woman : the females eventually shake the males by rolling until they fall off , but the males still try to pursue her as her sex pheromones drive them mad dozens of males twist and turn around each female 's body in a frenzied attempt to mate			2
the mating balls are a tightly wound group of males with one female at the center			2
when she decides she 's had enough , the female detaches from the males in a sort crocodilian death roll			0
a single red - sided garter snake den , and the ensuing sexual display , can contain up to 10,000 snakes and carpet the ground completely in slithering , shiny black scales			1
where the action is : the @entity83 in @entity12 are one of the best places to spot the creepy crawly rite of spring each year the red - sided garter snake only lives in dens of 1,000s in @entity3 , where the cold - blooded creatures require the warmth of the group in order to survive the winter			1
anyone with a desire to see the snake dens may do so when the weather warms up in @entity39 , @entity12 , @entity3			0
the @entity39 are home to tens of thousands of red - sided garters and each spring the sexual displays are hard to miss. in addition to seeing them emerge from their dens , visitors may also watch the snakes ' annual return			1
in the fall , as they sense the temperature dropping , the snakes regroup in the warm dens in a display a lot like the spring emergence , but in reverse .			0

the red - sided garter snakes of @entity117 , @entity12 gather by the tens of thousands in caves during winter
when temperatures rise , the males become *desperate* with pheromone - *spewing* females
males by the dozens pursue individual females in *giant* ' mating balls '
