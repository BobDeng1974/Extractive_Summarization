by @entity0 published : 14:09 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 14:09 est , 2 may 2012 @entity2 stuntmen have got nothing on a driver who had an amazing escape after a bizarre incident in a suburban @entity8 street			1
two different videos captured the man 's @entity10 seemingly traveling at normal speed down the residential street when it goes over a manhole			2
@entity15 ... alarm : the suv starts to rise in the air as the manhole shoots explodes out of the ground the metal cover then shoots up , causing @entity22 2 to suddenly flip up and almost totally leave the ground totally as its boot shoots into the air			1
the car then goes into a full 360 degree roll and almost completes a second roll , before coming to rest on its side			0
rise : a woman can be seen walking on the pavement as the @entity10 starts to lift off the ground unexpected : three of the cars four wheels are off the ground as the vehicle goes into a barrel roll side : the vehicle comes to a rest close to the now exposed manhole which seems to have exploded after a moment alarmed passers - by approach the @entity10 , as does the driver of the vehicle behind who captured the incident on camera			1
one man quickly scans the roof of the upturned car before reaching in through where its windscreen used to be			0
concern : a passer - by helps the driver from the vehicle , through its smashed windscreen uninjured : the shocked @entity10 driver ( in cream jacket ) is left scratching his head after the bizarre incident the dazed driver then emerges , almost unaided and after a quick stumble the man in a cream jacket stands up straight and has quick look around			1
he then steps back from the @entity10 , seemingly unharmed , and can be seen scratching his head trying to work out what had happened			0
unexplained : the manhole seems to explode sending the car in front into a barrel roll what caused the cover to blow is not clear , but afterwards it can be seen on the ground near the car			0
the fact that a fixed street camera caught the incident , as well as a second driver , suggests the incident was not a set - up .			2

the @entity10 suddenly shoots into the air while driving down a @entity8 street
manhole cover appears to blow - up directly under the car causing the *dramatic* scene
