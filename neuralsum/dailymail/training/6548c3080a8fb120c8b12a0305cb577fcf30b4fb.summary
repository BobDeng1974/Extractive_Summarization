by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is planning on an ' awesome ' @entity4 @entity3 weekend in a bid to raise his stock and profile further in @entity7			1
of the three @entity4 on the grid at present , @entity8 unsurprisingly remains the least well known in comparison to former world champions @entity12 and @entity13			1
the 23 - year - old has so far spent a season and a half in @entity7 learning his trade with back - of - the - grid team @entity18 , although improvements have been made this year as the @entity21 - based marque are nudging the midfield pack			1
profile : @entity4 driver @entity2 is hoping for an ' awesome ' display at @entity24 back of the grid : the @entity18 driver has been at the back of the pack for most of the season this weekend 's race at @entity24 at least offers @entity2 the chance in front of his home crowd to prove he is not merely a driver that makes up the numbers			1
' i love the circuit			0
@entity24 is old school , although it has been renovated quite a lot , ' said @entity2			1
' but you still have some really cool corners - @entity42 , @entity44 are awesome			2
you 'd never get bored of going through there flat in an @entity7 car			2
' it 's just an awesome home race , and not one of those where there are few spectators			2
it 's one of the most watched of the year			2
' you have all the campers , the helicopters coming in and out , and it 's a really good buzz over the whole weekend			0
' it 's just a good fun weekend , and i 'd like to think it will be a good one for us			0
' last year , around @entity24 , @entity62 started to catch us up			1
they were probably a little stronger , but we managed to out - race them - just ! ' so if we beat them last year when it was n't a particularly great time for us , then as we 're quite a way ahead of them at the moment we should have had a good weekend			1
' but that was last year			2
i just hope we can carry that on into this year			0
' aiming high : he is hoping to compete for attention with fellow @entity76 @entity12 hot couple : @entity13 with his girlfriend @entity78 at the recent @entity79 @entity3 fanatics : the pair are incredibly popular amongst fans of @entity7 @entity2 has finished 13th on two occasions , and also 14th this year , a reasonable return from the eight races to date			1
whilst there is unlikely to be ' @entity87 ' at @entity24 , @entity2 at least feels he is now making his mark on the sport and becoming more recognised			1
' my profile is something that 's improved since i 've been in @entity7 , ' added @entity2			1
' being on the parade laps i 've seen the occasional @entity8 flag , so that 's gone up a bit more , which is nice			0
' definitely more people are aware			0
the longer you are in something the more they pick up on a name			0
it has built as you would expect			0
' ' hopefully the @entity103 will be behind me this year			1
it 's just a shame the @entity106 starts in @entity107 this weekend			0
' but it 's two different sort of sports that should n't really affect the grand prix			0
' with mixed conditions expected at @entity24 again this weekend , that may yet play into @entity2 's hands when it comes to a positive result			1
@entity2 said : ' results are determined by the attrition in a race			2
if there is no attrition we 'll be happy with 17th , 18th			0
' if there is high attrition , it rains , people have split strategies then you do n't know			0
' qualifying is our usual target because it 's one where we can plan , so if we can get into @entity131 ( the middle session of qualifying ) then that would be awesome			0

@entity2 hoping to match the profiles of fellow @entity103 and @entity13
23 - year - old has been racing at the back of the grid all season with @entity18
this will be his first time racing in @entity7 on home soil
