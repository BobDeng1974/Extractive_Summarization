@entity8 , 43 , smashed a world record this month when she deadlifted 200kg at the 2013 @entity12 championships in @entity13			1
what makes her achievement all the more remarkable is not just that it is the fourth world record she has broken this year , but that she only began competing as a powerlifter two years ago			1
@entity8 , 43 , of @entity18 , has broken four world records in deadlifting since starting weightlifting in 2011 @entity8 , seen right in competition at the @entity23 competition in @entity24 in september had spent her life avoiding gyms until two years ago mrs @entity8 , of @entity18 , said : ' in my early 30s i fell into the habit of joining ladies - only gyms and giving up my membership after a month or so			1
' i would try the same old cardio exercises and soon it would become monotonous and boring			0
i really was n’t that interested			0
i ’d rather just sit at home on the sofa and watch tv			0
' i ’ve achieved so much since then - i ’m really proud of myself			0
' mrs @entity8 returned to the @entity36 in 1998 after several years of living abroad			1
after working in a variety of sales positions she set up a sports massage service in a gym in 2005 after meeting the gym ’s owner , bodybuilder @entity41 , 51			1
the pair married in 2009			0
at the @entity46 women 's masters competition ( pictured ) in @entity24 in september , she broke world records in her class for squat , bench press and deadlift mrs @entity8 said : ' i started weight training because i had idle time between massage appointments			1
at first i wanted simple exercises to improve my abdominal muscles			0
but i found i really liked it , and i was amazed at the difference it made to my physique			0
' even better , i found the weightlifting community to be lovely			0
everyone was really welcoming and friendly			0
' for the first time i was in an environment where people were praising and encouraging me to continue in the training i was doing , and giving me feedback about the results i was getting			2
it made all the difference			0
' supported by her husband and her 16 - year - old son and 19 - year - old daughter , mrs @entity8 was ready to try her first competition in 2011			1
the following year her daughter gave birth to a son - mrs @entity8 ’s first grandchild			1
@entity8 with her husband @entity41 , 51 , who she met when she began working at the gym he owned , at their wedding in 2009 this year , after countless hours of training , mrs @entity8 began breaking records			1
at the @entity46 women ’s masters competition in @entity24 in september , she broke world records in her class for squat , bench press and deadlift			1
she went beyond her personal best by deadlifting 200k at the @entity12 world championships in @entity13 in november 2013 , again breaking the world record			2
@entity8 says that she wishes she had started bodybuilding earlier in her life , but that she is proud of what she has achieved she said : ' looking back , i ’m extremely proud of my achievements			1
i ’ve worked hard for them			0
' sometimes i wish i could have started powerlifting earlier in my life , but i believe that everything happens as it is supposed to and i have no regrets			2
' mrs @entity8 has now started weight training classes exclusively for women , organised through her @entity109 group at @entity110 , and has become a vocal advocate for her adopted sport			1
she said : ' some women who powerlift have encountered negative reactions			2
there ’s a misconception that powerlifting could only be appealing to butch or unfeminine women			2
' most of those bad reactions have unfortunately come from other women who are overweight or who are ignorant about sport			2
i think that kind of ignorance usually reflects failings in the people who are making the criticisms			0
' when women come into the gym and ask me how they can lose weight i tell them , ‘ i can help you do that if you like , but have you ever thought about becoming strong instead ? ’ it ’s something they never think of , but most women like the idea			1
' powerlifting has given me wonderful benefits			0
i ’m lucky to have met some amazing people and i feel great			0
if i can help other women achieve that , then i would like to try			2
