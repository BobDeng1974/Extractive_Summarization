acting is in the blood : @entity2 , above , as she is today when @entity2 makes her debut in @entity6 's @entity5 this month , it will be the final chapter in the dramatic transformation from the debauched public image she presented when she embroiled her family in the ' @entity2 ' scandal			1
it should be a moment of happiness and joy for @entity2 , as she follows in the acting footsteps of her 84 - year - old grandfather @entity16 , who played hapless @entity18 waiter @entity17 in classic 1970s sitcom @entity20			1
but when she takes to the stage , @entity2 , who has spent the past 14 months at drama school , will look out on a heartbreaking sight : the two seats that she has reserved for her grandparents will instead remain empty for the entire evening			1
for even now , six years after @entity27 highlighted how @entity28 and @entity29 taunted @entity30 on a @entity32 show with an account of @entity2 's sexual antics , @entity30 and his wife @entity35 still can not bring themselves to forgive her			1
despite a brief reconciliation in 2013 , the relationship between the two parties has once again broken down – even though @entity2 , 29 , insists that she has buried her wild past and wants to become a serious actress			1
' i want to make things right between me and my grandparents , ' @entity2 says			1
' i love and miss them so much			2
i know how i behaved back then was wrong , but i 'm not that person any more			2
' if only they would see me perform … then they could see for themselves			2
@entity49 always said i needed to grow up and change			2
' well , i 've more than done that			2
i 'm just so sad that he 's not here now to give me advice while i 'm trying to launch my acting career			1
' when the @entity2 affair ignited in 2008 , @entity54 , then aged 23 , was part of a burlesque dance group called @entity2 whose performances featured ' sexy striptease and slutty activity '			1
and it was @entity28 's obscene phone call to her grandfather during his radio show , in which he boasted of sleeping with @entity54 , that forced her sleazy past into the public spotlight			1
the distress and humiliation it caused @entity30 was then sharpened by his granddaughter 's decision to furnish the tabloids with details of her sex life with @entity28			1
@entity2 is circled ' i admit i was a nightmare in my early 20s , ' she says			1
' i mixed with the wrong people			2
' i experimented with sexuality , with drugs , with everything			2
i made mistakes , and unfortunately some of them were on film			2
' if i could go back and have a word with my 20 - year - old self and tell her , ' do n't you dare ' , then i would			1
' i 've tried so hard over the years to repair my relationship with my grandparents			1
i 've sent letters , flowers , emails – but i never heard anything back for years			1
' they were understandably angry at me for talking to the press and for how i behaved with @entity28			2
' they are not getting any younger and i 'm so frightened that i might never see either of them again			2
' drama school is the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life			2
it 's been harder than being at the centre of a press scandal , harder than touring with a rock band			1
i 've never worked so hard in my life			2
' in truth , @entity2 's relationship with her grandparents first soured before @entity2			1
when she was 20 she lost the deposit they generously put down on a rental flat for her			0
the old me : @entity2 wants to put her outrageous past behind her she says : ' the flat turned into a party house			1
i basically trashed it and lost my grandparents ' deposit			1
they quite rightly were n't happy with me about that and i fully admit i behaved terribly			0
but i apologised and things had got better between us by the time everything kicked off in 2008			0
' i actually used the money i earned out of speaking to the press to pay back their deposit			0
i sent them a cheque , but i never heard anything from them			0
' when the row over @entity2 finally subsided , @entity2 decided to focus on her singing and was taken under the wing of 1980s pop star @entity139			1
she spent three years touring the world with his support act , a girl band called @entity144			1
' my grandparents heard about me touring with @entity139 and were really impressed with how hard i was working			1
in january 2013 , for the first time since 2008 , they wanted to see me			0
' we sat down and had a chat about everything and i thought we 'd put everything that had happened in the past behind us			0
' it was so lovely to see them , but at the same time i was really sad to see how my grandad had got a lot older and i 'd missed all that precious time with him			0
' @entity2 also received an invitation to her grandmother 's 80th birthday celebrations at the @entity160 in @entity161 , but says it was withdrawn at the last minute			1
' a few days before the party , @entity162 saw @entity139 on @entity29 's chat show and , for some reason , it upset her so much she uninvited me , ' she reveals			1
' i was completely devastated and i phoned @entity162 to tell her how hurt i was to suddenly be dismissed again			0
i told her how i thought it was really unfair , but she did n't like me telling her that , and i got cut out of their lives again			0
' she adds : ' i just want a fresh start			0
i 'm going to turn 30 this year , my acting career is about to begin and i want a clean slate			1
' i just want to make up with them and put everything that happened with @entity28 behind me			0
' having always wanted to ' follow in my grandad 's footsteps ' as a youngster , @entity2 has only recently begun to consider acting seriously			1
during a break from touring with @entity139 , she decided to do a four - day acting course at @entity181 , a drama school in @entity182 , @entity161			1
six years ago @entity29 and @entity28 taunted @entity16 about his granddaughter 's sexual antics ' to my surprise the director offered me a place on the two - year training course there and then , ' she says			1
' i was really shocked			0
i had n't really thought about going to drama school – i did the four - day course just to see if i was any good at acting			1
i spoke to @entity139 about it and he was really supportive and told me it was absolutely the right thing to do			0
' @entity139 and i are like brother and sister – there 's nothing sexual about our relationship			1
' we see each other all the time			0
when we meet up he helps me to rehearse			0
he reads the other part and helps me learn my lines			0
he loves doing different voices and is actually quite good			0
' after a gruelling 14 months training she is now preparing for the school 's public season			1
later this month she will play the pivotal role of @entity210 in @entity5 in front of an audience of agents and casting directors			1
and she has also been cast in the school 's musical theatre showcase , which will be performed to a public audience , opening on february 19			2
' above all , i just want my grandad to come and watch me			0
i want him to be proud of how hard i 've worked			0
six years on @entity16 and his wife @entity35 can not bring themselves to forgive @entity2 ' ever since i was tiny he 's always supported my ambition to be an actress and i 'd love to be able to go to him for advice now , but i ca n't			1
at secondary school i played @entity227 in @entity228 and @entity49 was there in the audience , just like he was for all my school plays			0
' he used to give me very honest feedback			0
he was always very proud of me , but he would give me constructive criticism too , as well as gross flattery			0
' @entity2 's father @entity235 is also an actor , previously touring with the @entity236 , while her mother , @entity237 , is a voiceover artist			1
@entity2 says : ' with both my grandad and my dad being actors , growing up i was always backstage at a theatre somewhere			1
i 've been around actors my whole life			0
' @entity244 is in my blood and i 've wanted to be an actor since i was a little girl			2
i just got a bit waylaid			0
i remember one @entity248 , @entity49 was performing as @entity17 in a cabaret act at the @entity250 and we all went to watch him			0
' i looked at him and thought , ' wow , this is n't my grandad any more			0
all of a sudden he 's somebody else			2
how cool is that ? ! ' ' that really inspired me			0
they say that at drama school they break you down and build you back up again			0
well , the teachers have worked extremely hard at breaking me down			0
but i 'm grateful for it			0
there have been times when i 've wanted to quit , but i 've stuck with it and i 'm coming out the other end			0
i just wish @entity49 could see that too			0
' despite @entity2 's plea it seems unlikely that her grandparents will witness her new incarnation			1
speaking to @entity27 last night , @entity270 , 82 , said : ' we have loved that girl , funded her and looked after her and everything			0
but after what @entity274 has done , i 'm sorry we can never see her again			0
' if she had n't told him [ @entity28 ] who her grandfather was , this would never have happened			2
' but they were sitting on the sofa together watching tv , i think they had actually just had sex , and when my husband came on screen she said , ' that 's my grandfather			1
' ' the next day he made the call			0
it 's been terrible we have been pursued ever since and never left alone			2
' @entity28 wrote us a letter apologising and has rung us several times			0
but the whole incident has destroyed our family			2

@entity2 is the granddaughter of 84 - year - old actor @entity16
six years ago she embroiled her family in the ' *sachsgate* ' scandal
the 29 - year - old has now *curbed* her wild ways and transformed her image
next month she will follow her grandfather 's footsteps into acting
but her grandparents still can not bring themselves to forgive @entity2
