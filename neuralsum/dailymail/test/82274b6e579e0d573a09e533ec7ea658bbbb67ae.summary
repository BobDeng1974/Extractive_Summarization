the @entity0 have accused @entity1 of a crude new attempt to ' weaponise ' the @entity3 by orchestrating a letter from doctors claiming hospitals will not be safe if @entity7 wins the election			1
@entity9 was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed that the @entity11 had made it harder to get a @entity14 appointment			1
mr @entity9 claimed there were now 600 fewer gp surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election – which he said was directly contributing to the @entity21 crisis			0
but critics were quick to point out that his figures were out of date – and that the gp crisis is widely blamed on @entity1 's gp contracts , which allowed them to opt out of out - of - hours care			1
meanwhile it emerged last night that a @entity1 - supporting @entity14 had circulated a letter claiming that ' five years of flat - line funding ' have ' crippled the @entity3 '			1
a version of the letter – organised by dr @entity44 , the former chairman of the @entity45 of @entity46 – appeared in the @entity47 signed by more than 100 doctors last night			1
it claimed the ' direction of travel ' under the @entity0 was towards privatisation , adding : ' another five years of @entity53 austerity will sap staff morale and reduce the @entity3 to a poor service for poor people '			1
@entity1 were accused of orchestrating the letter as a ' stitch up '			1
conservative mp @entity58 said : ' this @entity1 stitch up is another desperate attempt to weaponise the @entity3			1
' under this government , we 've got more doctors , more nurses and more patients being seen than ever before			0
' in an email obtained by the @entity0 , dr @entity44 said signatures were being collected to ' counter ' the 100 business leaders who wrote a @entity53 - supporting letter to a national paper last week			1
mr @entity9 claimed there were now 600 fewer gp surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election – which he said was directly contributing to the @entity21 crisis health secretary @entity78 has promised to give @entity3 chiefs ' whatever they need ' after the election			1
mr @entity78 yesterday claimed a @entity53 government would find whatever money the health service said was required to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and gp surgeries			0
the apparently open - ended commitment will raise eyebrows at a time when public spending is under increasing pressure			0
@entity3 chief executive @entity91 has said the health service needs an extra £ 8billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are			1
the @entity0 have pledged to find huge public spending cuts , and every pound spent on the @entity3 means less for other priorities such as education and defence			1
mr @entity78 told @entity99 's @entity100 : ' we will back the @entity3 's own plan in full ... we will give whatever they need , it might be more than £ 8billion , it might be less			2
' dr @entity44 said she was a member of the @entity1 but not an ' activist ' and said the letter had been organised independently			1
she told the @entity110 : ' it has not been orchestrated by @entity1 , it has been put together by me and a few other medical leaders			2
' the @entity0 say that at least two of the signatories are @entity1 supporters , including one who tried to stand as a @entity1 candidate and another who has previously spoken at the @entity1 conference			1
the signatories , including professor @entity120 , retired director of public health , and @entity123 , professor of public health in @entity124 , wrote that the @entity3 ' is withering away '			2
they said ' if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had under the @entity3 and have to pay more for health services			2
' meanwhile , as figures yesterday revealed that @entity21 waiting times are the longest since records began in 2004/05 , mr @entity9 said : ' one of the reasons for that is it 's got a lot harder to see a gp			0
' across @entity139 there are some 600 fewer gp surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends than there were at the last general election			0
' but health secretary @entity78 said @entity1 's ' shoddy figures are not only wrong but also expose @entity1 's rank hypocrisy over gp access '			2
mr @entity78 said the figures quoted only go up to 2013/14 and that since then , the @entity53 ' extended hours scheme , announced last year , has covered 1,100 practices and helped 7.5million patients see gps in the evenings and at weekends			0
he said by next year the scheme will cover 1,400 additional practices , serving 10 million more people			0
he added : ' the next @entity53 government will deliver a truly seven - day @entity3 , putting right a problem which began with @entity1 's disastrous 2004 gp contract			1
' mr @entity78 said the contract had allowed @entity46 to opt out of responsibility for their patients out of hours			0
he added that far from cutting funding , the @entity0 would give the @entity3 ' whatever it needs ' if the party wins the election			1
@entity165 leader @entity165 accused @entity1 of ' making cheap political points using outdated statistics '			1
' it 's pretty rich coming from a party that blew £ 12billion on an @entity3 super computer , ' he said			2
mr @entity165 also described shadow health secretary @entity171 as ' a slightly sort of cardboard cut out , a rather sort of silly @entity1 politician			2
' medical leaders also criticised @entity1 's claims yesterday			2
gp @entity176 , chairman of the @entity177 , said : ' @entity1 's poster is not fair			2
' patient access to extended hour services has n't got worse , as these figures ignore the prime minister 's new scheme			0
' @entity184 , shadow treasury minister , said the figures were the latest available			0
following the letter from 100 doctors claiming the @entity3 is not safe in @entity53 hands , @entity1 is today expected to launch a fresh attack over the health service			1
@entity192 sifts the claims from the reality			0
@entity195 : there are 590 fewer gp surgeries open at evenings and weekends compared to @entity1 's last year in office reality : shadow health secretary @entity171 is using figures which compare july 2009 to the year ending april 2014 - which means they are a full year out of date			1
this year is crucial in comparing the record of the last two governments			0
in april 2014 , @entity7 launched his £ 50million @entity207 to pay for @entity46 to open out - ofhours			0
it guaranteed at least one gp surgery locally would be available in the evening and weekends			0
the @entity0 say it has led to improved access for 7.5million people at 1,100 surgeries			2
by march next year , a further £ 100million will have been spent on a further 1,417 practices across the country			0
overall , there are now 1,600 more gps than in 2010			0
it is not the first time @entity1 has used old figures in what is already a dishonest election campaign			2
the party 's claim that families are £ 1,600 worse off under the @entity0 was also 12 months past its sell - by date			1
@entity195 : the @entity0 have made it harder to see a gp reality : anybody with memory of the @entity232 will know it is @entity1 - and the disastrous 2004 decision to renegotiate the existing gp contract - which lies at the root of the current problems			1
not only did @entity1 abolish the requirement for every patient to have a named gp who was responsible for them , instead attaching them only to a surgery , but , most crucially , gps were given more money despite no longer being required to work at weekends or at night			2
the inevitable result ? nine out often @entity46 stopped providing out - ofhours care - hugely increasing the pressure on hospital @entity21 departments			0
former health minister @entity249 said the deal @entity1 gave to the @entity46 was ' the best they ever had ... they probably all voted @entity1 in 2005 '			0
@entity53 health secretary @entity78 has since made modest changes to the contract , such as giving four million over- 75s a named gp , but there is still no requirement to work out - of - hours			0
@entity195 : the @entity0 have left the @entity3 weaker than at any stage in its history reality : in the latest attempt by @entity1 and the @entity260 to ' weaponise ' the @entity3 , 100 doctors last night released a letter which claimed the @entity3 was ' withering away ' under the @entity11 and ' if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had '			1
it went on : privatisation not only threatens coordinated services but also jeopardises training of our future health care providers and medical research , particularly that of public health			0
' the problem is that much of the letter is at odds with the facts			0
along with foreign aid , spending on the health service was ring - fenced from the cuts			0
every year , it has received a real terms increase of at least 0.1 per cent			0
this equates to around £ 2.5billion extra a year			0
on privatisation , the @entity3 outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the @entity1 - but less than 2 per cent under the @entity11			1
it was @entity1 - not the @entity0 - which presided over the shameful scandals at @entity292 and @entity291 hospitals which cost hundreds of lives .			1

@entity14 circulated a letter claiming ' flat - line funding ' had ' crippled ' @entity3
version of letter appeared in the *guardian* signed by more than 100 doctors
claimed the ' direction of travel ' under the @entity0 was towards privatisation
@entity1 were accused of orchestrating the letter as a ' stitch up '
