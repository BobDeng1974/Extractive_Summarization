when @entity1 signed his first long - term contract at @entity3 in the summer of 2009 , there was a real sense of excitement around the club			1
@entity1 was already the @entity7 ' youngest ever player in the league , and although he had played just six minutes of top - flight football , there was a belief around the @entity12 that he was the future			2
what they did not see coming was the amount of time he would spend out injured			0
@entity1 's many injuries which have seen him miss more than 100 weeks through injury in five years @entity1 could be out for up to four months after this tackle by @entity23 's @entity22 @entity1 broke into @entity3 's first team as a 17 - year - old and has always been tipped for the top the @entity3 star became the club 's youngest ever @entity29 player when he broke through in 2009 but @entity1 has been hampered by injuries since his @entity7 debut , with his ankles suffering most damage october 24 2009 - ankle - until dec 2 ( 5 1/2 weeks ) jan 8 2010 - @entity35 - until feb 9 ( 4 1/2 weeks ) november 14 2010 - back - until nov 23 ( 1 1/2 weeks ) august 1 2011 - ankle - until oct 27 2012 ( 65 weeks ) february 9 2013 - hip - until feb 16 ( 1 week - missed 0 games ) march 3 2013 - ankle - until april 13 ( 4 1/2 weeks ) may 20 2013 - @entity38 surgery - until july 4 ( 6 1/2 weeks ) october 31 2013 - ankle - until november 10 ( 1 1/2 weeks ) jan 24 2014 - ankle - until feb 8 ( 2 weeks ) march 5 2014 - ankle - until may 11 ( 9 weeks ) october 26 2014 - ankle / ilness - until nov 9 ( 2 weeks ) november 22 2014 - ankle - up to four months ( 16 weeks ) total : 119 weeks injured back in 2009 , @entity39 spoke glowingly of his young star : ' at still 17 years of age , the potential is huge for @entity1 and we ’re all delighted that he has committed his long - term future to @entity3			1
' @entity1 came off the bench in two @entity47 games that autumn , completed 90 minutes in the @entity48 , and made a @entity29 appearance in a win over @entity51			1
the world , it seemed , was at his feet			0
but , just as the teenager was building some momentum , he picked up his first injury , an ankle knock that kept him out of first team action for six weeks			2
the midfielder bounced back , making his full @entity29 debut in early february , and playing a part in 15 league games that season			2
but since that first injury five years ago , @entity1 has been plagued by ankle complaints , missing more than 100 weeks of football with various injuries			1
@entity39 looks on anxiously as his midfielder is treated for yet another injury , this time at @entity71 @entity1 is an @entity72 regular , but has seen his playing time limited by persistent problems with his ankles the young midfielder sits on the floor with an anguished look on his face after his latest injury set - back with his latest set - back possibly requiring yet more surgery , @entity1 could be out until march , at which point he will have missed 119 weeks with injury in five years - meaning the young star has been injured an incredible 43 per cent of his @entity3 career			1
during that time the 22 - year - old has racked up 95 @entity29 appearances , which may seem a lot at his age but it is just a fraction of what @entity39 would have hoped for			2
@entity1 has had hip , hamstring and back injuries over the last five years , but the vast majority of his issues have been with his ankles , which will , by the time he returns , have ruled him out of almost 112 weeks of football			0
@entity1 missed the entirety of @entity100 during his longest spell on the sidelines , which lasted 65 weeks the star has been out for 119 of the last 279 weeks , an astonishing 43 per cent of the time perhaps the only positive from @entity1 ’s latest injury is that it did not occur on his right ankle , which has previously required surgery			1
‘ it does not look good , ’ admitted @entity3 manager @entity39			0
‘ there is no bone damage but there is ligament damage			0
it is just how [ long ] it is , which we should know next week			0
' even in a best case scenario , it is another sad chapter in the sorry tale of missed opportunity that is @entity1 's injury - stifled career to date .			0
