by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a @entity4 girl born with the @entity6 virus and in remission for years despite stopping treatment now shows signs that she still harbors @entity10 — and therefore is not cured			1
the news is a setback to hopes that very early treatment with powerful @entity10 drugs might reverse an infection that has seemed permanent once it takes hold			1
the girl is now nearly four years old			2
as recently as march , doctors had said that she seemed free of @entity10 despite not having been on aids drugs for about two years			1
that was a medical first			0
but on thursday , doctors said tests last week showed that she is no longer in remission			0
she is now back on treatment and is responding well , doctors said			0
the news is ' obviously disappointing ' and may have implications for a federal study that had been about to start testing early , aggressive treatment in such cases , said dr. @entity47 , director of the @entity48			0
' we 're going to take a good hard look at the study and see if it needs any modifications , ' either in terms of length and type of treatment or because of ethical concerns over raising false hopes about an approach that now has suffered a setback , @entity47 said			0
most hiv - infected moms in the @entity63 get @entity6 medicines during pregnancy , which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies			2
the @entity4 baby 's mom received no prenatal care and her @entity10 was discovered during labor			1
because of the baby 's great risk of infection , doctors started her on unusually powerful treatment 30 hours after birth , even before tests could determine whether she was indeed infected			2
the girl was treated until she was 18 months old , when doctors lost contact with her			0
ten months later when she returned , they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her @entity6 medicines			2
crushing disappointment : dr. @entity36 , a pediatric @entity10 specialist at the @entity88 who has been treating the little girl , said hearing the news of her setback felt like a punch to the stomach tests repeatedly showed no detectable @entity10 until last week , when copies of the virus were measured in her blood			1
doctors say they do n't know why the virus rebounded when it did , and said it raises profound questions about what they know about @entity10 's hideouts in the body			1
silver lining : dr. @entity106 , a pediatric @entity10 expert at @entity107 in @entity108 , said the fact that the little girl remained off @entity6 drugs for as long as she did is unprecedented but some researchers in the @entity10 field remain optimistic			1
' the fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented , ' @entity106 , professor of infectious diseases at the @entity114 in @entity108 , told @entity121			0
in march , doctors revealed that a second baby born with @entity10 may have had her infection put into remission by very early treatment — in this case , four hours after her birth in suburban @entity129 in april 2013			2
nearly a year later , very sophisticated tests at multiple times suggested she had completely cleared the virus , but she remains on treatment so there is no way to know for sure			0
only one other person is thought to have been cured of hiv infection — @entity138 , from @entity139 , who had a bone marrow transplant in @entity141 back in 2007 from a donor with natural resistance to @entity10			1
he showed no sign of infection more than five years later .			0

the @entity4 girl , now 4 years old , was thought to be free of @entity10 despite being off @entity6 drugs for two years
girl 's mother received no prenatal care and her @entity10 was discovered only during labor
