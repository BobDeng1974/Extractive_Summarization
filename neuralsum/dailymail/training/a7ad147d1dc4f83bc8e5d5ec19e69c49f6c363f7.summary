complaint : @entity1 posted a video claiming she was touched inappropriately by a @entity4 agent a video has been posted on the internet by a woman who claims she was ' violated ' by a @entity4 agent during a full body check			1
@entity1 , 25 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , claims the clip shows the female agent touching her unnecessarily at @entity14			1
@entity1 is an activist who fronted an @entity16 opt - out campaign last year which urged people ' to film the @entity4 and to post the footage to youtube in an effort to raise awareness and to stop the tyrannical practices of the @entity4			1
' @entity1 and her mother both requested a full body scan and took turns filming what they perceived as improper conduct			1
the footage , which lasts just over three minutes , captures the incident on 23 may			1
in the video @entity1 repeatedly tells the unidentified @entity4 female agent not to touch her vagina , breasts , or her mother 's private parts			1
@entity1 told @entity36 that she and her mother were told by the @entity4 agent that they would undergo ' an extensive pat down which would involve going all the way up the leg			1
' the @entity4 screener first placed her hand on @entity1 ’s breasts , prompting her response : ' sorry , you just touched my boob			1
' after @entity1 tells the @entity4 agent that she does not want her breasts touched , the @entity4 agent threatens to stop the screening process , effectively prohibiting @entity1 from flying			1
' angry : ' she just touched my vagina , seriously , that was not my upper thigh , ' said @entity1 in the video clip march : an airport security worker who discovered a container of pepper spray at @entity69 sprayed five of his colleagues with the chemical as he was ' playing around ' with the canister			1
all six @entity4 screeners were taken to hospital , and security checks at @entity69 were said to have been held up for at least 15 minutes following the incident in @entity77			1
the phd student and researcher agrees to allow the pat down to continue , but steps back in a obvious fashion when the @entity4 agent feels high up on the inner part of her leg			1
' she just touched my vagina , seriously , that was not my upper thigh , ' declares @entity1 as she moves away from the agent			1
the day after the footage was @entity1 posted on her @entity90 page : ' was violated pretty badly by @entity4 at @entity14 yesterday			1
@entity91 will be on my @entity93 channel			2
' when she posted it on @entity93 several users wrote that the @entity4 agent was acting within guidelines			2
but @entity1 hit back : ' to all those people saying that i 'm " overreacting " - if you went up to someone on the street and touched them like that you 'd probably be arrested			2
it 's really sad that so many people have habituated to this type of treatment			2
' the campaign @entity108 held a weekend urging passengers to refuse ' to submit themselves to naked body scanners or being groped			0
' in a bid to attract publicity @entity1 has previously posted footage of her mother being given a pat down at @entity117 airport			1
she posted the footage on @entity93 and wrote : ' this @entity4 agent gives my mom the full grope - down at @entity117 airport and then complains that my brother is violating her rights by filming it			2
' he began filming after i refused to proceed with my pat - down because i was told by the @entity4 agent that she would be touching my behind over and over again until i did n't flinch			0
she also told me that i had to let her touch my other private areas with the backs of her hands or i would not be permitted to fly			0
' in an interview last year she told her idea for the campaign stemmed from a ' bad experience			0
' ' i was ordered around like a prisoner by the @entity4 agent , ' she said			0
publicity : @entity1 is an activist who fronted a national @entity4 opt - out campaign last year			2
she has previously posted footage of patdown 's at airports in a bid to highlight her campaign , seen here campaign : @entity1 has previously posted footage of her mother being given a pat down at @entity117 airport			1
she posted the footage on @entity93 and wrote : ' this @entity4 agent gives my mom the full grope - down at @entity117 airport and then complains that my brother is violating her rights by filming it			2
oh the irony ' ' when it came to my behind , she pressed on it very hard , hard enough for me to jump forward ' and i turned around and said to her what are you doing and she said you 're not allowed to move while i pat you down			0
' so she continued to pat me and did it again and i jumped forward again and at that point i said what what are you doing and she said i am going to do it over and over again and until you do n't flinch			0
' the @entity4 guidelines say : ' if a passenger can not or chooses not to be screened by imaging technology or a walk - through metal detector , the passenger will be screened using a thorough patdown procedure instead			0
a patdown procedure also is used to resolve any alarms of a metal detector or anomalies identified by imaging technology			0
' they state that they must be performed by an officer of the same gender and ' the officer will explain the pat - down process before and during the pat - down			0
' earlier this month a man was acquitted of indecent exposure after he stripped nude at airport security to protest against ' invasive measures ' by the @entity4			0
' invasive ' : @entity189 , from @entity190 , @entity191 , stripped nude at airport security to protest against ' invasive measures ' by the @entity4 at @entity193 @entity189 , from @entity190 , @entity191 , had a showdown with a @entity4 agent who said he found nitrates on @entity189 's clothes at @entity193			0
@entity189 took offense to this and saw it as an accusation that he could be a terrorist			0
the judge subsequently ruled it was an act of protest and therefore protected speech			0
the @entity4 was formed in early 2002 following the terrorist attacks on the @entity207 and @entity208			0
the @entity4 told @entity209 : ' it is the passenger ’s choice to either walk through the screening equipment or receive a secondary screening using a pat - down			0
' in review of the closed - circuit video , it is abundantly clear that the two @entity4 officers conducting the pat - down carried out their responsibilities in a professional and polite manner and according to procedure , offering the passengers the opportunity to have the pat - down conducted in a private setting and taking time to explain each step along the way			2
