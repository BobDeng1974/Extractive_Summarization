call : environment secretary @entity1 will today call for @entity2 to lead the way in adopting @entity5 foods children will go blind or die if the world does not embrace genetically modified crops @entity1 claimed today			1
the environment secretary issued the controversial ultimatum as he claimed @entity2 could lead the way in producing @entity5 food			1
he claims it would lower prices and free up the countryside			0
the environment secretary , a longstanding advocate of gm technology , claims its adoption in the @entity2 could be as significant as the agricultural revolution			0
but ahead of a major speech he claimed the decision to back the controversial technology is a matter of life and death			0
he said ' golden rice ' which could be grown in the world 's poorest countries was first created in 1999 but had not been used to help solve global hunger			2
' now the @entity34 estimates that up to 500,000 children go irreversibly blind a year , and 250,000 of those actually die			2
' now the problem is mainly in @entity38 , but over the last 15 years , despite offering the seeds for free to those who would need them , every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted			0
and in that time , seven million children have gone blind or died			2
i think all those who have thwarted the attempts to bring in this – for free , do n’t forget – should really reflect			0
' those are real young people , and today , young people will wake up this morning able to see , and they ’ll go to bed blind for life			0
some of them will die today			0
' in his speech mr @entity1 pointed out that since 1996 there has been a hundred-fold increase in the use of @entity5 crops around the world , with 17million farmers in 28 countries now growing what critics have branded @entity64 foods			1
less than 0.1 per cent of this takes place in the @entity67			1
' farmers would n't grow these crops if they did n't benefit from doing so , ' he argued			1
' governments would n't license these technologies if they did n't recognise the economic , environmental and public benefits			0
' consumers would n't buy these products if they did n't think they were safe and cost - effective			1
while the rest of the world is ploughing ahead and reaping the benefits of new technologies , @entity77 risks being left behind			0
we can not afford to let that happen			0
' the use of @entity5 [ technology ] could be as transformative as the original agricultural revolution was			1
the @entity2 should be at the forefront now , as it was then			0
' mr @entity1 – who comes from a long line of farmers and tanners and keeps sheep , hens and horses at his country home in @entity96 – claims that @entity5 farming can help feed people in poorer countries and inject missing vitamins into the diets of children in the @entity2			1
in a speech designed to appeal to traditionalists , he also argued that using @entity5 crops to improve yields will require less space , freeing up more greenfield land			2
' if we use cultivated land more efficiently , we could free up space for biodiversity , nature and wilderness , ' he said			0
he also argued that @entity5 crops can help combat the effects of @entity2 's increasingly erratic climate			2
environment secretary @entity1 claims adoption of @entity5 in the @entity2 could be as significant as the agricultural revolution mr @entity1 will argue that using @entity5 crops to improve yields will require less space , freeing up more greenfield land in recent weeks the prime minister , the government 's chief scientific adviser , sir @entity123 , and the science minister , @entity125 , have all voiced support for @entity5 crops			1
mr @entity1 intends to lead a campaign among @entity77 ministers to make @entity130 lift many of its restrictions on the use of gm technology			2
he said : ' i am conscious of those who have concerns and who need reassurance on this matter			0
i recognise that we – government , industry , the scientific community and others – owe a duty to the @entity2 public to reassure them that @entity5 is a safe , proven and beneficial innovation			2
' due to the speech 's controversial content , the location where it was to be delivered was kept wraps last night to avoid it being hijacked by protesters			0
flashback : campaigners dump four tonnes of @entity5 soya outside @entity158 in 1999 at the height of the protests against genetically modified food outlining what he will say , mr @entity1 told @entity163 's today show this morning that there was no evidence @entity5 foods are harmful			1
' the facts show that in other parts of the world @entity5 is being adopted as normal practice			1
in 2012 there were 17 million farmers in 28 countries growing @entity5 crops on 170 million hectares , that 's 12 epr cent of the world 's arable land or , very roughly , seven times the surface area of the whole of the @entity2			1
' these crops are now established , they are part of normal life , they are part of normal agricultural production , they are part of people 's everyday diets			0
' he questioned the reason behind the highly charged debate about the use of @entity193			2
' is it emotion or is it evidence ? there have been a whole raft of studies across the @entity67 , there have been about 50 projects over the last 25 years on @entity5 , 400 independent research groups			1
' @entity201 of the @entity202 warned : ' we need farming that helps poorer @entity206 and @entity207 farmers produce food – not farming that helps [ @entity5 producers ] @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity213 produce profits			1

@entity1 said children are dying because @entity5 food is n't being adopted
17million farmers now grow @entity5 products around the world
but *resistance* to so - called ' @entity193 ' has *slowed* *uptake* in the @entity67
