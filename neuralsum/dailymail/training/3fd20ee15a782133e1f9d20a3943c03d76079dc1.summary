@entity0 believes the prospect of facing @entity2 in a friendly will mean more to @entity4 than any of their @entity6 qualifiers			1
the @entity9 manager feels @entity11 's men are freewheeling in an uninspiring section comprising of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
@entity4 racked up their fourth successive win with a 3 - 1 triumph over @entity13 on saturday and are expected to coast to top spot without engaging top gear			1
@entity9 boss @entity0 is excited for @entity2 against @entity4 at @entity23 @entity24 is one player @entity4 can rely on , and will thrive in the cauldron of hate at @entity23 accordingly , @entity0 believes the prospect of a blood and thunder @entity30 at @entity23 on tuesday will quicken the pulse more than any game on the road to @entity34			1
' the group we are in is poor , ' @entity0 stated			2
' there 's no competition in it			0
it 's not like the @entity2 group			2
that 's a tough group , with good teams in it			0
' @entity4 's group really is one you ca n't judge them on			2
i watched the game last night ( against @entity13 ) and the other team are just a poor team			0
i mean what was their standard ? what are they ? a championship team at best , middle / bottom half of the @entity57 probably			2
' i think from the punters ' point of view , if you are going to @entity61 do you want to watch @entity17 or someone ? really ? ' you would want to watch them play @entity2 or the @entity64			1
if you ask me if i 'd rather watch last night 's @entity4 game or the game on tuesday night , i 'd rather watch the game on tuesday			1
it 'll be a full - blooded affair			1
' @entity2 beat @entity70 and @entity0 expects a ' full - blooded ' affair when they face @entity4 on tuesday having finished bottom of their @entity74 group with a solitary point , @entity4 have much to do on the international stage to convince their fans they are still worthy of still being considered one of the nations			1
tomorrow 's game may be a friendly but @entity0 feels the importance of it will not be lost on @entity11 's players			2
' i think they will take it seriously , ' he added			0
' they will know there is a lot of pride at stake			0
they will come and want to perform well			0
they are on a good run			0
' they can only beat what 's in front of them but we 're in a poor group			0
this is a much better test and i think it will be interesting to see how we come through this one			0
' the mere fact of @entity4 - @entity2 and the traditions of the game will come out and it will be a full - blooded affair			1
' i remember coming here with @entity109 when @entity4 won 2 - 0 but @entity2 came to @entity61 and battered us when @entity111 scored and @entity4 hung on for grim life			1
' @entity4 's 100 per cent start continued with a 3 - 1 win over @entity13 , but it failed to excite @entity0			1

@entity2 host @entity4 at @entity23 on tuesday night
@entity0 is excited to see the match , despite it being a friendly
he thinks the ' full - blooded affair ' will be far better to watch than any of the 2016 @entity57 qualifiers @entity4 have played so far
