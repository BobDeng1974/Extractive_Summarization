increasing numbers are taking part in what 's been dubbed ' virtual identity suicide ' and deleting their accounts			0
analysis of more than 600 people , by researchers from the @entity16 , found that data protection issues and social pressure to add friends were also among the reasons for leaving			2
others quoted shallow conversations , general dissatisfaction and loss of interest in the site			1
facebook users are quitting the social network in droves due to privacy concerns and fear of internet addiction , according to research from @entity16			1
analysis of more than 600 people found that data protection issues and social pressure to add friends were also among the reasons for leaving privacy concerns : 48.3 per cent general dissatisfaction : 13.5 per cent shallow conversations : 12.6 per cent fear of becoming addicted : 6 per cent more than half of residents in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity47 use @entity45			1
@entity42 has the most with 63 per cent , followed by @entity44 on 61 per cent			0
@entity47 has 58 per cent of people on the social network site , while the @entity41 has 55 per cent and the @entity43 has 47 per cent			1
@entity45 in @entity42 has 2.25 million monthly users			1
a third of @entity42 @entity45 users want less photos and more status updates and get annoyed by images of their friends ' children			2
two in five @entity42 adults admitted to lying on @entity45			2
source : @entity61 / @entity60 2013 earlier this year , reports suggested that @entity45 lost nine million active monthly users in the @entity43 and two million in @entity41			1
these figures originated from research carried out by @entity66 in april			0
the figures come straight from @entity45 's @entity68 , but is not the same as @entity45 losing user numbers , for example			2
monthly active users are the number of people who log into their account over a 30 - day period			1
socialbakers saw a drop in this figure prior to the report in april			0
however , only because a person does n't log on for 30 days does not mean they have left the site entirely - which is where the distinction lies			0
that said , psychologist @entity86 from the university recorded each of the 600 participants ' responses to assessment measures based on their level of concern over various issues			0
those who stopped using social media were more concerned about privacy , had higher addiction scores and tended to be more conscientious			2
professor @entity86 said : ' it could be possible that personality traits influence the likelihood of quitting one 's @entity45 account indirectly via privacy concerns and internet addiction			1
' in this case , the concern about one 's privacy and internet addiction propensity would not be directly in charge for quitting one 's @entity45 account , but would function as mediators of the underlying personality traits			1
quitters were older , on average , and more likely to be male			0
reasons for quitting @entity45 were mainly privacy concerns at 48.3 per cent , general dissatisfaction at 13.5 per cent , negative aspects of online friends , 12.6 per cent , and fear of getting addicted at 6 per cent compared to the sample of those who continued to use @entity45 , the quitters were older , on average , and more likely to be male			1
reasons for quitting @entity45 were mainly privacy concerns ( 48.3 per cent ) , followed by a general dissatisfaction ( 13.5 per cent ) , negative aspects of online friends ( 12.6 per cent ) and the feeling of getting addicted ( 6.0 per cent )			1
@entity129 , editor of the journal @entity131 which published the findings , said : ' given high profile stories such as @entity135 and the recent @entity137 surveillance reports , individual citizens are becoming increasingly more wary of cyber-related privacy concerns			2
' with photo tags , profiling , and internet dependency issues , research such as professor @entity86 's is very timely			0
' according to journalist @entity143 from @entity144 , leaving @entity45 can be a long - winded and difficult process			0
after struggling to find the @entity147 option , which she eventually found by searching @entity149 , she was met with photos of a selection of her @entity45 friends with an automated message about how much they 'd miss her if she left			0
she was then asked to tell @entity45 the reasons why she was leaving , which she said was due to privacy concerns , before @entity45 tried to persuade her to stay by explaining more about how the site handles private data			1
@entity45 warned her that by deleting her account she 'd lose all of her photos and posts , before trying to convince her to stay by telling her she could deactivate her account for as long as she liked , and then just login to reactivate			0
by deactivating , everything on her profile would stay where it is but would become hidden in case she wanted to return to the site			0
' @entity45 â€™s hard sell did not stop me from deactivating my account			0
but three days later , when i wanted to get in touch with an old friend , i reactivated my account like an ex-girlfriend who ca n't quite commit to a breakup -- just as @entity45 had designed , ' said @entity143			0
@entity143 claims that @entity45 uses four persuasion techniques to make people stay and these include making it complicated , giving people the option to take a break rather than delete it completely , tapping in to personal friendships and connections and trying to solve any problems the user has .			2

report suggests @entity45 recently lost active users in the @entity43 and @entity41
the *majority* of people quitting the site blamed concerns over privacy
other reasons included fear of addiction , and shallow conversations
