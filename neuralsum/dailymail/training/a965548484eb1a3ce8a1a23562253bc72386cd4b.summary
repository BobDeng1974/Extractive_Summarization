a new phone app for people as young as 13 to find any private parties on offer in the area has proved in high demand but there are serious concerns it will be misused by gatecrashers			1
founder of @entity11 , @entity12 , from @entity13 , came up with the idea when he was at a venue which was closing and he wanted to know where else he could party on nearby			1
the party app was launched on friday without any fanfare yet gained 5,000 downloads by the end of the weekend - mr @entity12 's target for the entire month			1
' it will change the way people party forever , ' mr @entity12 told @entity27 - who had expectations of getting no more than 1,000 users on the app in the first weekend			1
the @entity48 , which runs school and youth programs to end alcohol and drug fuelled violence , is concerned about any technology that opens up parties to strangers			0
the foundation 's general manager @entity57 said suggested invitations should be unique and parties should not be promoted via text or open social media networks			0
' @entity64 program educates adults and young people about holding safe parties and one of our key messages is that if you do n't know the person , do n't let them in , ' mr @entity57 said			2
mr @entity12 , 29 , argues that the app was in fact safer option to invite people to parties than sites such as @entity79 because the host has full control of who they can attend the event			1
guests receive a ticket to be able to enter the party which the host scan at the front door and there is also a system for rating the guests			0
' once you 've attended the party you have to rate it out of five stars and the organiser then votes three attendees for @entity97 - most valuable partier - you reward people for positive partying , mr @entity12 said			1
' people end up generating a score out of 100 for their historical partying and if you get a party pooper rating it will ruin your reputation which means you wont be invited to anymore parties in the future			2
' mr @entity12 had expectations of getting no more than 1,000 users on the app in the first weekend mr @entity12 ( second from right ) is happy to sit down with the police to discuss the app 's benefits to prevent the ' party poopers ' from re-registering under different names , mr @entity12 said he was looking into introducing guests posting a photo of their driver 's licence or some other form of @entity122 - as well as their profile picture			1
. however , @entity125 president @entity124 described the app as fraught with danger ' and said police will probably monitor it to look at intercepting any arising issues			0
' i do n't see it as a winner			0
there 's going to be no control in regard to the people that attend , ' he told the @entity140			0
mr @entity12 said he had contacted the police to let them know about the benefits of young people using the app. ' we have nâ€™t received a response yet but we are looking forward to sitting down with them and giving them some confirmation about how this is going to make their life a little bit easier , ' he said			1
mr @entity12 said he foresaw the potential criticism that the app could bring which he remained mindful of while building the design			2
' we are expecting a really positive conversation , ' he said			0
' ultimately , the natural response is " the party is going to get out of control " but once you learn about some of the features i think the police are going to warm to it very nicely			2
' the @entity48 advises against young people inviting strangers to their parties			0
