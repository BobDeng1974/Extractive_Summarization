doctors in @entity31 , where the family now live , prescribed a synthetic form of cannabis to ease the side effects of the chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting			1
but @entity12 's parents took the treatment one step further , giving their 11 - year - old son cannabis oil , through his stomach tube - with the full support of his medical team			1
@entity68 minister @entity67 has become the latest high profile name to call for cannabis to be legalised for medical use			0
@entity0 , 49 , originally from @entity71 , told @entity10 : ' i found myself coaching him on how to inhale cannabis vapour from a vapourising machine			1
' it was surreal - but it worked brilliantly , and gave him instant relief			0
' my drug problems have been well documented			1
i nearly lost my life			0
but now they are being used instead to help @entity12			0
' @entity12 's illness came as a huge shock to his parents and older brother @entity84 , 12			2
his mother @entity39 , 50 , said : ' before he became ill , he was a normal , energetic little boy			1
he loved skate - boarding , dirt - biking and football			0
' everything was going well until we were hit with an almighty bombshell			0
' a sore throat did n’t clear up and a swelling appeared on the side of @entity12 's neck			2
initial tests for lymphoma were clear – and the family breathed a sigh of relief			0
doctors told @entity12 's family surgery was too risky and that he would need rounds of chemotherapy and radiation to treat his disease			1
they prescribed the drug marinol - a synthetic form of cannabis - to help ease the effects of the treatment @entity0 told @entity10 : ' i found myself coaching him ( @entity12 , pictured ) on how to inhale cannabis vapour from a vapourising machine			1
my drug problems have been well documented			2
i nearly lost my life			0
but now they are being used instead to help @entity12 ' dr @entity118 , @entity119 ’s science communications manager , told @entity10 : ' we know that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours			1
' but at the moment there is n’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients			2
' despite this , we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts			0
' these stories can help researchers build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not , although this is weak evidence compared to properly - run clinical trials			2
' @entity119 is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabis extract and a synthetic cannabinoid			1
' in order to gather solid data on how best these drugs can be used to benefit people with cancer			0
' but five days before christmas 2012 , he became very ill. with @entity0 away on tour with the newly reformed band , @entity39 kept him updated with texts			1
and one night , as he was about to take to the stage in @entity158 , his phone bleeped with news which was to change his life			0
' they are admitting him into hospital for more tests			0
50 - 50 chance it ’s cancer , ' the message read			0
@entity0 said : ' i was in a daze throughout the gig , i ca n’t remember playing at all			0
' it was like i was on autopilot , just going through the motions , not being able to think of anything else other than my family so far away and the fact that @entity12 ’s life might be in danger			2
' his wife , said : ' by this time the swelling had grown much bigger			0
' the doctors said he only had 10 more days before it would completely block his airways			0
' we were worried sick			0
' we laid all his presents in his hospital room on christmas day , but he had no interest in them			0
@entity12 's mother @entity39 , said : ' the @entity192 worked a little at the beginning , but we were told that real cannabis worked much better			1
i never in a million years imagined that i would ever be buying cannabis oil for my 11 - year - old son and giving him relatively high amounts of it down his stomach tube ' ' it was so surreal to know that the rest of the world was oblivious , enjoying the festivities , tucking into turkey and having happy family times , while we were stuck in a hospital , dealing with our worst nightmare			1
' three days after @entity50 , @entity12 , then 10 , was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma			2
@entity0 told @entity10 : ' i walked in there , to his hospital room and i just lost it , he looked so sick and frail			1
i went straight into the bathroom and threw up			0
' it was the start of a battle which would see @entity12 cheat death more than once – while his father and uncle , @entity1 front man @entity37 , hid their secret heartache from fans			2
' my drug problems have been well documented			2
i nearly lost my life			0
but now they are being used instead to help @entity12 ' - @entity1 bassist , @entity0 his wife said : ' @entity37 was shell - shocked ; he sent text messages to @entity226 saying he could n’t believe it and how he wished we were n’t so far away			1
' like most people , he just did n’t know what to say			0
' surgery was too risky , and so @entity12 began a 43 - week course of chemotherapy , along with radiation			1
doctors prescribed a drug called @entity237 – a synthetic form of cannabis – to ease the chemo nausea			1
@entity39 said : ' the @entity192 worked a little at the beginning , but we were told that real cannabis worked much better			1
' so because we were living in a state where medical cannabis is legal with a doctor ’s recommendation , we asked the doctors for approval , and they agreed			0
' as they saw how beneficial it was for @entity12 , they were very supportive			0
' i never in a million years imagined that i would ever be buying cannabis oil for my 11 - year - old son and giving him relatively high amounts of it down his stomach tube			1
' what is n’t quite so widely known is that cannabis also seems to have the ability to actually fight the cancer itself , as well as mitigating the side effects of the chemo			2
' @entity12 's uncle , and @entity1 front man , @entity37 , said : ' our @entity12 kicked cancer , he is a real fighter ' for @entity0 , the irony of giving drugs to his son was not lost			1
he told @entity10 : ' i am a recovering addict and have n’t had a drink or drug for many years , so there ’s no way i would ever have encouraged my son to take cannabis			1
' but when @entity39 told me what she had discovered i could n’t really argue and had to agree that we had to get some for him			2
' it was the best thing we could have done			0
in my opinion it ’s a medicine not a drug , and thank goodness we were living in @entity283			0
' our @entity12 kicked cancer , he 's a real fighter ' - @entity286 and @entity1 front man , @entity37 ' we built up the dose slowly as his tolerance rose			1
it made a big difference in his overall well - being			0
' it definitely made the treatment more tolerable			0
it certainly did n’t solve every problem but it helped make his life more bearable through the treatment			0
' in december last year , the family got the best news they could have hoped for – @entity12 was in remission			2
his mother said : ' @entity12 has lost his hair and needs a wheelchair from the side effects of his treatment , but we know he ’ll be back on his feet soon			1
' he still has a very cheeky sense of humour and he ca n’t wait to return to normal life			0
' @entity0 and his band mates are now planning their first ever black tie ball for @entity12 - and hope the little boy will be well enough to fly to the @entity315 as guest of honour			2
his uncle , @entity37 , said : ' our @entity12 kicked cancer , he is a real fighter			2
' in december last year , @entity12 's parents @entity39 and @entity0 , and his older brother @entity84 , front right , received the news they longed for , the 11 - year - old was in remission			1
