by @entity0 last updated at 12:42 pm on 3rd november 2011 for many teenagers , being told not to eat fruit and vegetables would be welcome news			2
but @entity5 , now 22 , was devastated when she was told she could no longer tuck into the fresh produce after developing a bizarre allergy			1
the student developed a bizarre allergy to fruit at her boarding school when she was 15 - years - old			1
allergic : if @entity5 ate the fruit she is pictured holding her throat would close up and she would suffocate now at university , @entity5 must take a cocktail of vitamins to compensate for the lack of nutrition in her diet			1
she wants to raise awareness for others about her rare condition which also means she has to avoid many cosmetics and fruit - based shampoos			1
experts diagnosed @entity5 with ' oral allergy syndrome ' , which is made up from a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth to fresh fruits and vegetables			1
it typically develops in hay fever sufferers but can improve in later life			2
the former public schoolgirl was boarding at @entity37 , @entity38 , when she experienced her first reaction			1
miss @entity5 said : ' we used to get melon every day during break times			1
' one day i was messing around with my friends and i put my whole face into the fruit			1
' after about 10 minutes i had a red raw rash on my face and my throat began closing up			2
' i love melon and i tried to eat it again but the reaction was even moreextreme the second time so i knew i must be allergic			1
' after that i started having reactions to all fruit and some vegetables			2
it gotso bad that i was forced to cut it out of my diet completely			2
' people accused me of making it up and said i was a fussy eater orthat i was just doing it for attention			0
' but nothing could be further from the truth			0
you 've got no idea how hard it is to avoid eating or coming into contact with fruit			0
' i have to take it really seriously			0
when it happens my airways close up @entity76 've been told i could suffocate to death if i left it untreated			0
' @entity5 not only has to keep an eagle eye out for fruit within other foods but has to check cosmetic products			1
she told how an innocent sleep over turned into a nightmare when sheexperimented with a new hair conditioner			0
she said : ' i was having a girly night in with my friend @entity86 and we decided to use this new hair treatment she bought that 's meant to repair split ends			0
' after a few minutes i felt this burning sensation on my back and i had redwelts where the conditioner had dripped off my hair			0
' i ran screaming into the shower and managed to get it all rinsed off.when i read the packaging i saw it had avocado in it			0
i though ' oh greatanother thing i ca n't eat '			0
' awareness : @entity5 wants to highlight oral allergy syndrome @entity5 's mother @entity104 and stepfather @entity103 , from @entity105 , in @entity106 , are both pharmacists and make sure she is fully equipped with antihistamines for whenever she goes back to university			1
currently studying animation at @entity111 in @entity112 joked that she 's not all that different from everyday students			0
@entity5 said : ' most my friends are pretty much on a fruit free diet anyway so i do n't notice that i ca n't have it most of the time			1
' but i do miss eating it			0
it 's ironic because i was really healthy before thishappened and i always made sure i had my five a day			1
' a spokeswoman from @entity121 said : ' fresh fruit and vegetables are common causes of an unusual condition called oral allergy syndrome			2
' oral allergy syndrome is the medical term for an allergic reaction to foodwhich is limited to the lips , mouth and throat			1
' those who suffer with seasonal allergic rhinitis or ' hay fever ' are more than likely to suffer , as it has been shown that pollens from trees ( especially @entity139 ) , grasses and weeds contain proteins of similar structure to those present in certain fruit , vegetables , nuts and spices			2
' these proteins are recognised by the immune system of a person with hay fever and can trigger an allergic reaction in a susceptible person when they eat a food which shares the same protein as the pollen			1
' if you have oral allergy symptoms , it is important that you are referred to an allergy specialist			0
this will ensure that you have a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment			0
' avoidance of the foods that cause your reactions is most important			0
usually , cooking will destroy the allergens so that you need not worry about cooked food			0

@entity5 always had her five - a - day before she developed a severe allergic reaction to fresh fruits
