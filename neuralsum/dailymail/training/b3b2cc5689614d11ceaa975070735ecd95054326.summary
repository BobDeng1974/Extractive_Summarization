@entity0 finds it hypocritical that drag queens can impersonate women but white people can not ' put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of african - americans '			1
the comment was said to be prompted by a trailer for the upcoming season 7 of @entity46 's @entity45 , which debuts on march 2			1
lashing out at the 45 - year - old 's comments , the show 's official @entity48 account tweeted : ' oh no she better do n't ' , and shared a video titled ' a message for @entity0 '			1
