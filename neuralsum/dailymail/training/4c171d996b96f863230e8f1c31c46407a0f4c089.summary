this is despite the first image of @entity3 being released – exactly a year and four months after the atrocity			2
the long delay has led to claims of a cover up being mounted around the 45 - year - old ’s past life			1
he was shot seven times by a pistol - wielding assassin , but the @entity8 led inquiry continues to focus on the @entity28 family , who lived in @entity29 , @entity30 , as the attackers ’ main target			1
an alleged ‘ vow of silence ’ by those close to @entity3 has fuelled claims that an individual or group known to him wanted him dead			2
@entity3 ’s body was found in a forest layby near @entity42 in eastern @entity8 on september 5 , 2012			1
close by , in a @entity46 estate car , @entity45 , 50 , his wife @entity43 , 47 , and her mother , @entity44 , 74 , lay dead			0
each had been shot three times , all at least once in the head			2
their two daughters , @entity51 , then 4 , and @entity52 , then 7 , survived			0
the focus of the inquiry has so far been on a dispute that @entity56 is believed to have had with his 54 - year - old brother , @entity57 , over their father ’s inheritance			1
@entity3 was , however , involved in a dispute over a lucrative pharmacy business that was being transferred to his girlfriend , @entity63 , a 30 - year - old heiress , by her parents			1
@entity3 had just had a son with @entity63 and had given up his job as a metalworker at a factory making nuclear components			2
there was tension over the amount of cash that @entity3 was accepting from @entity63 , including the money to buy the £ 4,000 racing bike that he rode to his death			0
detectives have also uncovered romantic entanglements that @entity3 was trying to keep secret			0
ongoing : @entity8 authorities insist the @entity28 family , from @entity29 , is the focus of the investigation but a @entity8 police spokesman said today : ‘ the focus of the investigations remains the @entity28 family			1
it appears that the cyclist was in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
enquiries into his background are all but closed			0
’ the refusal of the @entity8 authorities to release a picture of @entity3 has prompted the television channel @entity8 2 to show it in its documentary programme @entity97 ( unresolved ) yesterday and to put it on the internet in the hope of jogging people ’s memories			2
the undated image , provided by a former colleague , shows mollier in the football kit of his firm , @entity107 , before a match			0
detectives have confirmed his identity			0
@entity112 , a payroll manager from @entity113 , @entity30 , who was arrested last year but provided police with a confirmed alibi , is convinced @entity3 was the real target , saying in october : ‘ they are covering up for someone in @entity8 in that region and they know it			1
there is something more to it locally			0
