' it 's wonderful to have the ring back			0
when my father died in 1993 my mum gave me his pinkie ring as a memento because he wore it all the time , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' i needed to get it enlarged because my fingers were bigger than my father 's but it must have weakened the band because while i was clearing my neighbour 's garden a few months later it just came off			1
' i was absolutely gutted and searched the back yard for weeks but i eventually gave up thinking the ring had gone forever			2
' it had n't really crossed my mind since then but on christmas day night i was having a drink with some friends and they asked me about a little metal box which was on my shelf			0
' i told them i 'd found it in my back garden and @entity79 then piped up " that 's nothing , @entity38 found a gold ring a few months ago			0
" ' a shiver went right up my spine and i drew a sketch of how i remembered the ring that i had lost all those years ago			0
' i just said to him , " my @entity90 i think that could be mine , " and i drew the design of the ring , which has a @entity88 on it , and he said it was the same ring			0
' @entity38 rushed across the street to her house and brought it back to my house and gave it back to me , i was incredibly grateful and amazed it has turned up after all this time			0
' mr @entity6 turns the earth in the flower bed where the ring was found : his neighbour @entity38 found the ring while digging up beds in advance of planting roses in her back garden mr @entity108 , 56 , a firefighter , said : ' at @entity38 was digging a flower bed up to make way for a rose bush and spotted this gold ring			1

we 're delighted we could reunite him with it			0
' there was even talk about selling it because it is such an unusual piece - but we 're very glad we did n't now			0

the ring *slipped* from @entity6 's little finger as he cleared up a neighbour 's garden in 1993
he spent weeks hunting for the treasured keepsake which belonged to his father but believed that it was lost forever
then the new *occupant* of the house discovered the ring while digging a rose patch nearly two decades after it was lost
