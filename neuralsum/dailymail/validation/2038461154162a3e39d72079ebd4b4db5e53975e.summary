millions more pensioners will be able to cash in their retirement deals under reforms to be announced this week			1
@entity3 will use this week 's budget to grant the option to five million @entity7 retirees stuck on rip - off annuity rates			1
attempting to woo the ' grey vote ' , he will extend to them the same freedoms that have already been offered to those approaching retirement			1
but the chancellor said it was ' patronising ' to suggest that allowing @entity39 to use retirement funds as bank accounts would see many blowing the money on expensive holidays or fast cars			1
he said yesterday : ' i just think that is a very patronising attitude to take towards people who have shown responsibility , saved through their lives , saved for a pension			2
by changing the law we are trusting people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives			2
' mr @entity3 's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from april next year			1
a crackdown on those who illegally dump waste , from discarded sofas to vast piles of rubble , is expected to be announced in the @entity67			0
the @entity68 will get an extra £ 4.2million to pursue the perpetrators of ‘ waste crime ’ and those who dodge landfill taxes , as well as cleaning up the damage caused			0
after being given £ 5million in last year ’s budget the agency estimated it raised £ 16million of revenue			1
in one case , it tracked 6,000 tons of waste illegally accepted at a waste site at which those involved were seeking to evade £ 500,000 of landfill tax			0
with just weeks to go until the election , it is one of the flagship measures in a pre-election budget that mr @entity3 yesterday said would feature ' no giveaways , no gimmicks '			1
other expected announcements include : - another rise in the income tax threshold to around £ 11,000			0
- a review of hated business taxes to boost small firms and high streets			0
- measures to create a so - called @entity97 , with high - speed links between @entity99 and @entity100			2
- fast - tracking the building of 45,000 new homes at 28 ' housing zones '			0
- a populist 2p cut in beer duty and another freeze in fuel duty			0
- a crackdown on tax avoidance , including a ' @entity111 tax ' on multinational firms that try to avoid paying dues in the @entity7			0
- a pre-pay travel card based on @entity117 's @entity116 scheme to boost travel between major northern cities			2
the planned annuity reforms will give pensioners the same opportunity to access retirement funds as mr @entity3 announced last year for those who had not already taken their pensions			1
annuities have become increasingly controversial amid plunging rates and poor - value products			0
removing restrictions will allow pensioners to either take the cash as a lump sum or place it in a so - called ' drawdown ' product to use the proceeds more gradually			1
mr @entity3 's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from april next year mr @entity3 will scrap punitive tax charges of up to 70 per cent for pensioners who want to sell their annuity income so they are taxed only at their marginal rate			1
the chancellor , appearing on the @entity145 's @entity144 with shadow chancellor @entity15 , said : ' it 's all part of trusting people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives			1
' he promised ' a budget for the long - term ' , saying the government has to continue ' making difficult decisions '			2
@entity156 dem pensions minister @entity155 , who proposed the measure , said : ' as a @entity156 i believe that today 's pensioners should have the same freedoms as tomorrow 's pensioners to spend their hard earned savings as they wish			2
' @entity163 , of the @entity164 , warned of ' considerable complexities ' over the tax implications of cashing in annuities			0
@entity168 , of pensions firm @entity169 , said the idea is ' full of pitfalls ' , and pensioners who were sold a poor - value annuity may be offered a poor - value cash lump sum			1
' two wrongs do not make a right , ' he said			0
mr @entity3 promised ' a budget for the long - term ' , saying the government has to continue ' making difficult decisions ' @entity183 , of consumer group which ? , said : ' pensioners who 've been ripped off in the past must be properly protected from a second rip - off if they decide to sell it			1
' @entity189 , of the @entity190 , also expressed concerns , saying : ' it 's clear to see how this fits with this government 's agenda for pensions but what is less clear is how savers will be protected			2
' @entity199 , of life insurance firm @entity200 , added : ' anyone turning future annuity income into cash is giving up a guaranteed flow of income – for their and possibly a partner 's future life			1
swapping this for a lump sum , calculated based on a range of factors , is undoubtedly a complex and risky decision and specialist advice would be essential			0
' the @entity216 said it would be in charge of introducing protections for consumers who sold their annuities			0
the watchdog is already overseeing the pension freedoms that have already been granted .			0
