@entity1 must regain control of its borders or quit the @entity4 , @entity0 warned yesterday			1
the @entity6 mayor said it was a ‘ deception ’ to claim @entity1 could control immigration while diktats from @entity10 over freedom of movement were in place			1
his comments were seen as a criticism of the prime minister who had said he would cut net migration to the tens of thousands – even though he had no control over the number of @entity4 workers flooding in			1
mr @entity0 said reclaiming control over our borders should be the ‘ number one ’ priority in the renegotiation with the @entity4			2
@entity0 took aim at @entity30 's @entity29 for opening @entity1 's borders to @entity32 in 2004 , but also @entity34 's pre-election pledge to cut immigration to the tens of thousands			1
he said @entity34 should be brave enough to lead the campaign to walk out of the @entity4 in the 2017 referendum if @entity10 fails to cede enough powers			1
his tough words on immigration come just days after @entity41 surged to victory in the @entity43 by - election and came close to winning the @entity30 seat of @entity46 and @entity47 in the @entity48			2
and they came amid claims the prime minister could face a leadership challenge if he loses another seat to @entity41			0
the mayor told the @entity56 ’s @entity55 show that the @entity57 under mr @entity34 had been guilty of ‘ deception ’ over immigration because of @entity61 ’s open borders			1
he said it had been wrong for the party to claim at the last election that it was possible to control immigration from the @entity4			2
challenging mr @entity34 to be tougher in his negotiations with @entity10 , he said : ‘ it ’s obviously axiomatic that if we do n’t get the reform that we need in 2016 - 17 then i think we should campaign to come out			2
‘ but on the border controls thing ; that is critical			0
that is emerging as the number one thing that we need probably to sort out in this negotiation			0
’ the @entity6 mayor insisted that if mr @entity34 's plans to claw powers back from @entity10 fail , he would back @entity1 leaving the @entity4 altogether the prime minister has promised to claw back powers over our borders as part of his promised renegotiation of powers ahead of an in / out referendum by the end of 2017			1
yesterday mr @entity0 said that if this was not achieved , he would campaign for us to come out of @entity61			0
asked if mr @entity34 should promise to lead the out of @entity4 campaign if the negotiations do not go well , the mayor said : ‘ yes , i do think that			1
’ he said there had been two ‘ big deceptions ’ over the past decade ; the first being @entity29 ’s opening of the borders to @entity99 in 2004 when other countries imposed restrictions			1
the other , he said , was ‘ saying we could control the numbers when we could n’t ’			0
this was seen as a reference to mr @entity34 ’s pledge at the last election to cut migration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands			1
while the number of people leaving the @entity1 has remained at around 80,000 , the numbers arriving from the @entity4 have risen sharply net migration from @entity4 countries has risen sharply in recent years , hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to march 2014 , according to data from the @entity115 despite the prime minister ’s immigration pledge , the numbers arriving each year have continued to top 200,000 , fuelled mostly by large numbers from the @entity4			1
meanwhile , it emerged that one cabinet minister believes that mr @entity34 could face a leadership ballot if the @entity57 lose next month ’s @entity123 and @entity124 by - election to @entity41			1
former @entity127 mp @entity126 is standing for @entity41 there after defecting last month			0
the minister was quoted as saying : ‘ if @entity131 wins @entity123 , there ’ll be 46 names			0
’ this is a reference to the 46 mps who would need to sign a motion calling for a conservative leadership vote under party rules			2
but he added : ‘ @entity34 would win			2
but it would be very damaging			0
’ last night a former @entity127 cabinet minister said it seemed ‘ implausible ’ that there would be a ballot so close to an election			0
‘ i do n’t know where the 46 would come from , ’ he said			0
and a party source said everyone was ‘ focused on fighting hard to win @entity123 and @entity124 ’			0
one @entity127 mp tried to dispel rumours of a leadership challenge			0
@entity151 said : ‘ even if we lose @entity123 , which we will not , now is not the time , with 200 plus days to go to the general election , for a change of leader			0

@entity34 pledged @entity57 would cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands '
but @entity4 rules mean it is not possible to turn away people from *member* states
more than 200,000 more arrived than left last year , mostly from the @entity4
@entity164 also *blasts* @entity29 for opening doors to @entity32 in 2004
without the ' right *solution* ' he would back @entity1 leaving the @entity4 entirely
