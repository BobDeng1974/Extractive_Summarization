and the terrorist , @entity20 , a man well - known to the @entity22 intelligence community , told @entity14 in an email that the @entity25 psychiatrist should keep his contact details handy			1
in contact : army maj. @entity14 ( left ) exchanged emails with known terrorist @entity20 ( right ) but the agents on the @entity13 's @entity33 anti-terrorism task force thought the issue of a @entity36 soldier talking to extremists was too sensitive to bring up with the @entity38 , rep. @entity30 said after he was briefed on the findings of the independent review on wednesday			1
' it shows you the length of the political correctness stuff going on , ' he told the @entity0			0
fbi director @entity45 called for the review in 2009 and asked a former bureau director , @entity47 , to lead it			0
the @entity13 is expected to release an unclassified version of the report this week , @entity30 said			0
trial : @entity25 lt. col. @entity52 is the lead defense attorney for maj. @entity14 a @entity54 report released last year also said the @entity13 missed warning signs about @entity14 , who @entity54 investigators said had become an @entity16 extremist and a ' ticking time bomb ' before the rampage			1
but @entity30 said some of the emails described in the @entity47 report were ones he had not previously seen			0
immediate reviews into the government 's handling of the @entity14 case revealed that members of two @entity13 anti-terrorism task forces saw emails between the @entity25 psychiatrist and @entity20 beginning in december 2008			1
those task forces reviewed the communications and decided they were in keeping with @entity14 's research at the time , and as a result , no formal investigation of @entity14 was opened			2

the @entity13 in @entity85 had been investigating @entity20 , a former @entity85 resident , for his possible connections to the 9/11 hijackers			0
when agents saw emails between @entity14 and @entity20 , they asked the @entity13 's @entity33 office to talk to @entity14 's bosses , according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the @entity47 report			1
but the @entity33 agents thought that interviewing @entity22 muslims who visit extremist websites was a sensitive issue and did not reach out to @entity14 's bosses at the @entity38			1
@entity13 agents also misinterpreted an abbreviation the @entity25 used regarding @entity14 , @entity30 said			2
the @entity25 identified @entity14 as a ' comms			0
officer , ' and , while the @entity25 meant @entity14 was a commissioned officer , the @entity13 interpreted it to mean that @entity14 was a communications officer			2
the trial is taking place at the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity6 the @entity13 decided not to disseminate an intelligence report on @entity14 because the @entity13 thought that as a communications officer , @entity14 would have seen the report , the government official said			1
neither the @entity13 nor @entity47 responded to requests for comment			0
but the @entity13 and @entity38 have said that they 've made several policy changes since the @entity5 assault to help prevent similar attacks			2
