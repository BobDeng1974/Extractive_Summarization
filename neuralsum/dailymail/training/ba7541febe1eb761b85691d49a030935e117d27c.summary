by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 11 august 2013 @entity2 : 04:45 est , 12 august 2013 shoplifters caught stealing are being released by police and handed free food vouchers			1
officers across the country have been issued with the vouchers that allow criminals to collect three days ’ supply of provisions donated to food banks			1
some shoplifters claim that they had no choice but to turn to crime to feed themselves or their families			1
some people believe handing out vouchers to shoplifters will encourage thefts but critics have said giving vouchers to offenders rewards thieves at the expense of law - abiding citizens			1
hundreds of food banks have been set up by churches and community groups across @entity32 to give emergency food parcels to those in need			1
doctors and social workers can issue vouchers for food banks to those struggling to pay for food			1
but the vouchers are also given to police officers , who are allowing criminals to go free with vouchers instead of being charged for them			1
@entity45 have handed out seven vouchers ‘ to individuals in need ’ since march			1
in the latest case , an unemployed shoplifter was cautioned and given a voucher as he was released from a police station after admitting stealing from a shop in @entity55 , @entity56 - on - @entity57			2
the man , who had spent his benefits on vet bills for his dog , said : ‘ i was given a caution and well and truly learnt my lesson			2
as i was leaving , a sergeant beckoned me and said , “ we do n’t often give these out , but take this please			2
” it was a voucher for a food bank which i redeemed the next day			2
‘ humanity is alive and well			0
i apologise for my actions and am thankful we have such kind people working in the force			0
’ @entity45 said : ‘ the arrested man made an honest and frank disclosure			1
he handed the stolen food back straight away			0
' a caution was deemed most appropriate			0
the custody sergeant deemed this individual met the strict criteria for a food bank voucher			0
’ however , the scheme was suspended in @entity84 last night after local police and crime commissioner @entity85 ordered a review			1
the scheme set up in march allows shoplifters three days ' worth of supplies donated to foodbanks he said it was ‘ absolutely not acceptable that criminals should appear to be rewarded ’			1
mr @entity85 added : ‘ it ’s not the case in this situation but that ’s what it looks like it and that ’s something i ca n’t tolerate			0
’ @entity105 , chairman of @entity106 ’ @entity104 in @entity84 , criticised the decision to give vouchers to offenders			1
he said : ‘ it is ridiculous			0
it is encouraging people to shoplift			0
they will think if they get caught they will get some free food			0
it will probably put people off donating			0
i would n’t want something i had given to go to a criminal			0
’ in south @entity121 , one of the @entity120 ’s safer neighbourhood teams has given out 75 vouchers for the @entity124 and @entity125 food bank in six months			2
police community support officers in the @entity127 have issued vouchers to people they suspect to be a shoplifting risk as a ‘ preventative measure ’			1
food banks provide goods including milk , pasta , soup , tinned vegetables , fruit juice , tea and biscuits			0
@entity141 , executive chairman of the @entity142 , which runs more than 370 food banks and helped almost 350,000 people in 2012 - 13 , said : ‘ food banks will not know whether someone has been cautioned or caught shoplifting if they are referred to a food bank with a voucher signed by a police officer			0
it does n’t say on it and should not say on it what the back history is , but it should say that the person ’s need is genuine , that the person is in difficulty and needs emergency help			0
‘ that is what food banks are for – to provide emergency food for people when they are in trouble			0
because the public donate all the food , we need to assure them that we ’re giving the food to people whose need is genuine ... that is why we operate a voucher system with a whole range of professionals holding vouchers			2
‘ if police officers are able to choose an alternative way of dealing with someone who they believe is genuinely in trouble and has made a mistake , that actually costs the country less in the long term than taking them through the courts , but that is a judgment they make			0
’ a @entity120 spokesman said : ‘ @entity191 police have given out 75 vouchers for the @entity124 and @entity125 food bank in the last six months			2
the vouchers were issued by response team officers who identified individuals or families in crisis during their day - to - day work			1
‘ the response has been extremely positive with all vouchers used and people helped who were not previously aware how they could access their local food bank			2
the vouchers have categorically not been given to shoplifters			1

scheme was set up in march in @entity84 and gives shoplifters three days ' worth of supplies
the idea has angered some groups who believe it will promote theft
@entity45 confirmed it has issued seven vouchers
charity says demand for vouchers has *increased* *170* per cent in past year
