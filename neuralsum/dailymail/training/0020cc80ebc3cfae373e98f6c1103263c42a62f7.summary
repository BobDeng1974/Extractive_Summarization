have you ever wanted to see the world through your partner ’s eyes ? that 's the concept behind @entity7 ’s @entity6 experiment that uses @entity9 headsets to let wearers experience how other people see the world			1
each partner wears the head - mounted displays , and by synchronising their respective movements , they can virtually feel and see the other person ’s body through their own eyes			1
it was created by @entity34 - based artists beanotherlab one member of the couple is called the user , while the other is the performer			2
through the @entity9 goggles , the user is shown a video stream taken from the perspective of the performer 's eyes			1
each couple agrees on a set of synchronised movements and the partner 's mirror each others hand gestures , and so on , while wearing the headsets			1
by mimicking movements , it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing , is actually being seen through the eyes of the user			2
the user can move and interact with objects in a room , while listening to the performer 's thoughts spoken through headphones			0
this generates the perception of someone speaking inside their mind			0
the experiment uses @entity74 's machine to be another ( @entity76 ) system			1
@entity76 is an art installation developed with support from the @entity79 and the @entity80 in @entity34			2
it was set up at the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83			0
through the use of the headset , and a series of first - person cameras , the system creates the illusion that partner a can see what is being recorded by the visor worn by partner b , and vice versa			1

by mimicking movements , it creates an illusion that what the performer is seeing , is actually being seen through the eyes of the user by mimicking movements , it creates an illusion in the brain that what the performer is seeing , is actually being seen through the eyes of the user			0
the user can also move and interact with objects in a room , while listening to the performer 's thoughts spoken through headphones			0
this generates the perception of someone speaking inside their mind			0
it ’s called the @entity6 experiment because it focuses on letting men and women see the world through the eyes of the opposite sex			1
the system is an example of an ' embodiment experience ' - a neuroscience technique in which users are made to feel as if they are in a different body			2
it can be used to promote empathy , for example , or increase understanding of differences between sexes the experiment uses virtual reality @entity9 goggles , pictured , that claim to ' simulate being anyone or anything ' however , it can also reveal to wearers what it ’s like to be short , or tall ; thin , or overweight			1

it can be used to promote empathy , for example , or increase understanding of differences			0
according to the researchers , @entity76 was ' designed as an interactive performance installation			0
' [ it ] offers users the possibility of interacting with a piece of another person ’s life story by seeing themselves in the body of this person and listening to his / her thoughts inside their mind			1
‘ our main interest through this approach is to use the ‘ machine ’ as a tool to help promoting empathy among individuals of different social , cultural and ideological contexts			0
' the people involved in the project include @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 .			0

the @entity6 experiment was set up by @entity74 in @entity34
its system lets people experience the world through another person ’s eyes
each partner wears an @entity9 head - mounted display
using *built* - in cameras , the image from one display is shown on the other
by synchronising movements , wearers ' experience ' their partner 's body
