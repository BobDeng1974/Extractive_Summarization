unless you ’re fortunate enough to be flying business class , airline meals are usually something to be endured rather than enjoyed			2
the food is often either soggy or dry , the choice is likely to be limited to a couple of dishes , and by the time the stewardess gets round to serving you , your preference may not even be available			2
another grumble is that the meals are served up at times that may suit the crew but not you – so you may discover that lunch arrives at 11am and dinner at 5pm			2
tired of airline food ? airport restaurants now offering takeaway options for the plane - called ' on - board picnics ' you can take your own food , of course , and a sandwich and drink bought at the airport can save you a packet , especially on low - cost flights , which often charge punitive amounts for their in - flight catering			1
@entity32 has more interesting culinary options to take on to flights			1
last month , it began offering ‘ on - board picnics ’ from the many restaurants across its five terminals			1
it claims it is the only airport in the world to provide this			0
several of them will place items in their own cool bags at no extra charge to take aboard – and last week i sampled some of their offerings			2
@entity50 will prepare anything from its menu ( apart from oysters ) to take away in its slick , black cool bag			0
my very palatable smoked salmon and shrimps ( £ 27 ) came on a plastic tray with slices of brown bread and a wedge of lemon , with three mini ice blocks to keep it all chilled			0
yo ! sushi at @entity32 offers ' plane @entity68 food ' meals , including platters of sashimi and nigiri sushi from yo ! sushi , you can pick up its ‘ plane @entity68 food ’ meals costing £ 15 or £ 17 , in a fun container emblazoned ‘ i am a cool bag ’			1
with a decent - size platter of sashimi and nigiri sushi , a pot of fruit salad and a carton of coconut water , mine was reasonable value			1
cheaper , single - item dishes are also available			0
my third offering was from @entity91			0
about 80 passengers a day are buying the restaurant ’s three - course picnic meals costing £ 12.95			1
mine included thin slithers of roast beef with a green salad , and a generously sized chocolate and pecan brownie			0
it was all rather good – especially as you end up with a @entity103 - branded cool bag			0
the picnic menu – see @entity105 – offers a choice of dishes for each course and , like the others , can be pre-ordered			0
@entity111 's @entity110 will put its pizza in standard takeaway boxes upon request the other restaurants i visited could all package food to take on to the plane , but most did n’t flag up the service and did not offer cool bags either			1
nonetheless , some are definitely worth considering			0
for example , @entity111 ’s perfectionists ’ cafe will , on request , put its pizzas ( from £ 9 ) in standard takeaway boxes			0
though the pizza will be cold by the time you ’re at 35,000 ft , in all likelihood it will taste a lot better than in - flight meals			1
caviar @entity50 and @entity73 ! sushi meals came with instructions to eat within two hours , so do n’t wait to tuck in until you ’re halfway to @entity138			1
in this respect , it strikes me that raw seafood is arguably the worst option for in - air picnic food			1
cool bag : one of @entity103 ’s plane food picnics , which can easily fit under your seat when you 're done the restaurants ’ cool bags will easily fit in an overhead locker or under your seat , and are collapsible once empty			1
but when full , they are large – @entity50 ’s measures 11in x 0.7in x 4in and is therefore too big to fit into most carry - on cases			0
many airlines flying from @entity32 generally allow a compact second bag , but check if in doubt			2
if you do n’t want a fancy meal , @entity32 has other options			2
the cheapest ? a £ 3.79 meal deal from boots for a sandwich , a bag of crisps and a drink .			0
