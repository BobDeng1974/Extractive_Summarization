by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 31 may 2013 a coroner has asked the police to investigate the following what he called a doctor 's ' extraordinary ' delay in treating a seriously ill baby			2
@entity8 coroner @entity7 halted an inquest this afternoon and said he would be sending the notes to the @entity11 to investigate a possible case of gross negligent manslaughter			1
the inquest heard that seven - week - old @entity14 died from a severe brain injury after her artificial breathing tube became dislodged in the neo-natal unit at @entity18			1
there was a ' window ' of about 30 minutes before dr @entity21 , who was in charge of @entity23 , reacted and had the endotracheal tube changed			1
experts said that it was probably during a 30 - minute window that @entity14 was starved of oxygen leading to the brain injury heartbroken mother @entity30 accused locum paediatric consultant @entity31 of ' killing her baby ' after an expert said they hoped the doctor had learned from his mistakes			1
tearful mrs @entity14 , 26 , interrupted the @entity8 hearing and said : ' it 's all right sticking up for him			2
' experts have told the inquest the tube had been incorrectly fitted by dr @entity21 and it was probable that the baby was starved of oxygen during this time , leading to the brain injury			1
professor @entity50 , a consultant neo-natologist called to give evidence for @entity23 's family , said there were several clinical failings by dr @entity21 which amounted to a ' fundamental error ' having been made			1
he failed to discover the tube had been dislodged and properly assess the baby , did not secure her airways , ignored the clinical picture and dismissed concerns voiced by fellow nurses and a junior doctor			2
a professor told the inquest that there were several clinical failings by dr @entity21 which amounted to a ' fundamental error ' having been made in @entity23 's case in the end he brought in an on - call consultant before making the decision to change the tube			1
prof @entity50 said : ' i think dr @entity21 made an error in his clinical judgment and this was a fundamental error during a resuscitation situation which was compounded by failure to take account of information which was being made available to him			1
' the inquest has already heard from another paediatric expert dr @entity80 that the consultant 's inaction during the 30 - minute period amounted to ' gross failure ' and he should have changed the tube earlier			1
summer was the seventh child of builder @entity86 and @entity30 @entity23 , who weighed only two pounds and two ounces when born on april 23 , 2011 by caesarean section after 27 weeks gestation , had a promising start but began to suffer breathing problems			0
she required several intubations and ventilation to aid her breathing but during the early hours of may 4 began to deteriorate			0
dr @entity21 inserted a larger endotracheal tube at 2.40am but her condition worsened and she collapsed at 5.03am			1
staff were particularly alarmed as the baby had a large amount of gas in her stomach			0
they summoned dr @entity21 who arrived minutes before 5.35am and did checks but failed to spot the tube had become dislodged			1
it was eventually replaced at 6.03am			0
by this time the damage was done and @entity23 was transferred to a specialist unit in @entity8 where she died on june 11 when she was just 49 days old			2
prof @entity50 told the hearing the tube fitted by dr @entity21 was ' much higher than you would wish it to be ' and the infant 's abdomen was visibly distended indicating the tube was incorrectly placed			1
an x-ray was taken at 5.40am but not viewed until 6am by the doctor			0
' you would want to see it as soon as possible , ' said prof @entity50			0
' if the tube is in the wrong place and the baby is not being ventilated properly that is an urgent situation			0
' he said the consultant 's primary aim in resuscitating @entity23 should have been to establish that @entity23 had a secure and open airway			0
the lack of an airway was ' likely to have caused significant brain damage			0
he added : ' there was a fundamental failure and it was unusually persistent			0
' he did not believe there was any criminal culpability but calling in a second consultant to remove the tube was ' most unusual			0
' summer 's artificial breathing tube became dislodged in the neo-natal unit at @entity18 dr @entity139 , a consultant neo-natologist called by dr @entity21 's legal team , told the inquest the tube must have moved some time after 5am but nobody had been able to pinpoint why			1
@entity145 agreed there was an ' error of judgment ' by dr @entity21 in failing to replace the tube during the 30 - minute window but in her opinion it was not serious enough to be reported to the medical authorities			1
he should have revisited standard resuscitation procedures when the baby collapsed and had adopted a ' blinkered ' approach which was a breach of duty			0
' as events did unfold it becomes less understandable and less rational but judgment becomes clouded by the stress of these situations , ' she said			0
summer was the seventh child of builder @entity162 and @entity30 , of @entity164 , @entity18			0
@entity165 said she died from a hypoxic brain injury which was ' quite extensive and widespread ' but it could have been a combination of several factors rather than a single event			2
dr @entity21 qualified as a doctor in @entity171 in march , 1993 and has practised in the @entity172 since 2000			2
he has worked as a senior house officer on neo-natal units in @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 and has been on the specialist paediatrics register since august , 2009			0
after the inquest was adjourned @entity180 , the family 's solicitor said : ' although they continue to grieve for @entity23 my clients are pleased that mr @entity7 has recognised the magnitude of the failures in her care at @entity189 by referring the case to the @entity11			2
' we now await a decision on whether a criminal prosecution for gross negligent manslaughter will be pursued			1
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
