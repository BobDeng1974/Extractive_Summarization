a young man who suffered a stroke claims he is being denied life - saving surgery to close a hole in his heart , despite the @entity6 funding weight loss operations			1
@entity7 has criticised the health service , claiming ' it would be fine if i needed a gastric band '			1
the 28 - year - old suffered a stroke while working as an hgv mechanic			1
spotting the signs , his wife @entity15 rushed him to hospital in time for medics to save his life			2
mr @entity7 , who has run the @entity20 and played football five times a week , was shocked when doctors told him he had been born with a hole in his heart			1
@entity7 and @entity25 are desperate for him to have a procedure to close a hole in his heart after he suffered a stroke			1
but the 28 - year - old has been denied surgery on the @entity6 and must pay for the operation privately but he is now embroiled in a battle with hospital bosses to have the hole closed - procedure he believes would drastically reduce the chance of him suffering a second stroke			1
but hospital bosses say the @entity6 does not currently ' routinely commission ' the operation			1
mr @entity7 ’s own consultants have written asking them to give the go - ahead but the @entity6 does not believe the benefits of the operation justify the costs			1
instead , mr @entity7 must take a daily cocktail of pills for the rest of his life to reduce the chances of blood clots			1
he fears it is only a matter of time before he suffers another stroke			0
now after battling @entity6 red tape for more than two years , the couple have decided the best option is to raise the £ 10,000 needed to fund the operation privately			1
mr @entity7 said : ' it is like walking round having a ton of bricks over my head , waiting for them to fall and kill me			1
i want to move on with my life but i ca n’t until i have this operation			0
' i do n’t smoke , i eat healthily , i have worked all my life and paid my taxes but when i needed the @entity6 , it was not there for me			1
' what makes it harder to take is when i see people getting boob jobs on the @entity6 and it seems that i would be fine if i needed a gastric band if i had eaten too much			1
' how on earth do they get approval for these things which seem to reward unhealthy lifestyles - what do i have to do to get my operation ? ' i did not ask for this problem			2
' a series of expert cardiologists have told mr @entity7 , who now works for a railway company , there is a ' desperate ' need for the operation known as a @entity92 which would close the flap - like opening in his heart			1
if the flap remains open it could allow a blood clot to travel from one part of his body to the brain causing another stroke			0
in march 2012 mr @entity7 was rushed to hospital having suffered a stroke			1
there , doctors revealed he had been born with a hole in his heart			1
he says experts have told him the operation , which the @entity6 says it does not currently ' routinely commission ' , would reduce his risk of suffering a second stroke mr @entity7 suffered his stroke in march 2012 and has been to more than 50 hospital appointments since then			1
the process of ' being pushed from pillar to post ' during the past two - and - a - half years has at times left the couple at their wits ’ end			0
mr @entity7 ’s speech can sometimes be slurred which has also knocked his confidence			1
he believes it was only thanks to being young and healthy that the impact of the stroke was not more severe , as he did not suffer any paralysis			0
trying to raise the money for the operation has also been challenging for the couple			0
all people are born with flap - like openings in their hearts			2
but , for most , the opening closes by itself shortly after birth			0
in some people , an open flap remains between the two upper chambers of the heart ( the left and right atria )			0
this opening can allow a blood clot from one part of the body to travel through the flap and up to the brain , causing a stroke			0
currently , there are two main treatment methods for pfo - medicines or @entity149 closure , which can include open - heart surgery or a newer procedure that closes the flap without major surgery			1
medications do n’t treat the actual @entity149 , but they can control clotting factors in the blood so stroke - causing blood clots are less likely to form in the first place			2
in recent years , a new approach has been developed , enabling doctors to seal the @entity149 without major surgery			2
an implanted closure device , which can resemble a tiny two - ended umbrella , is delivered to the @entity149 using a small tube threaded to the heart from a vein in the thigh			2
the implant is inserted through the flap and released from the tube			0
he said : ' i feel embarrassed asking people for money			0
i am quite a proud man and i have " put in " throughout my life , so it ’s a hard thing to do			0
' we could sell the house , but we have worked hard to get this and it ’s our home and our place where we have settled			0
' if i have the operation on the @entity6 i would then be able to work , without question , for another 45 years which would be 45 years of my @entity184 and taxes going into the pot. ' but if i was to be struck down with another stroke , that could be me taking out of the @entity6 for the rest of my life			1
' the costs of the operation would be a drop in the ocean for the @entity6			1
' mr @entity7 had to give up his @entity195 driving licence as a result of the stroke			1
this also dashed his dreams of becoming a pilot as regulations mean he will not be able to fly			0
he has raised his concerns with @entity204 mp @entity203 who has pushed the health secretary for answers			2
mrs @entity25 , 32 , a photographer , said : ' we have been fighting for two - and - a - half years but we have not got anywhere			0
' we have always worked so hard and given back yet when we needed the @entity6 , we have been pushed around from pillar to post			1
' and then it ’s so frustrating when we see the decisions by the @entity6 to fund things like gastric band operations			1
' a spokesperson for @entity215 said : ' we understand how difficult this is and sympathise with the patient who may feel they could benefit from this procedure			0
' there is more evidence needed to show that @entity92 ( @entity149 ) is of sufficient benefit to patients and consequently @entity215 ’s policy is that it should not be routinely commissioned			2
' it is likely that @entity149 will be commissioned at a limited number of centres during the autumn through its £ 16.9million ‘ @entity230 ’ programme			2
' this trials treatments which clinicians have identified as showing significant promise as a potential treatment option			0
' @entity230 is aimed at gathering evidence about services which are not currently routinely funded by the @entity6 as the existing evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient clinical and cost - effectiveness for its routine use			1
' @entity242 from @entity243 , had a boob job on the @entity6 to boost her confidence the number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £ 52.5million			1
many of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment , but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses			0
in one case , @entity242 had an enlargement after saying her @entity258 chest was ruining her life			0
the former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it emerged she had a £ 4,800 state - funded boob job at the same @entity265 that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two - year - old to walk			1
she later claimed her breasts , which were boosted from a @entity258 to a @entity269 , were ' so big ' she found them embarrassing , and called on the @entity6 to pay for a reduction			2
and barman @entity272 , 22 , of @entity273 , in the @entity274 , was given a nose job by the @entity6 – and boasted how easy it was to get the £ 5,000 procedure			1
he now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery , including another nose job , as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped			0
the obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill , with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in ten years			2
the cost in the most recent year will have been up to £ 9.6million , according to @entity289 which says the operation costs between £ 1,500 and £ 5,000			2
there has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £ 19.9million			0
this operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision			0
and 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £ 34.1million			0
@entity299 , of the @entity300 ’ @entity298 , said : ‘ it ’s ludicrous the @entity6 pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs			0
’ the figures were compiled by the @entity305 , following a request from the @entity307			0
@entity272 , from @entity273 , who had a £ 5,000 nose job operation on the @entity6 it also showed that up to £ 20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations , £ 5.8million on tummy tucks and £ 5.7million on ear pinning			2
however , these totals have declined over the past decade			0
last month health secretary @entity313 told a @entity315 lunch : ‘ we should not be doing cosmetic work on the @entity6			2
’ @entity318 , of pressure group @entity319 , said : ‘ there are two types of cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better			0
' we agree with the secretary of state that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the @entity6			0
in fact , it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all			0

@entity7 was rushed to hospital having suffered a stroke in march 2012
doctors told him he had been born with a hole in his heart
28 - year - old said experts have said an operation to close the hole in his heart could *prevent* a second stroke
but the @entity6 do *n't* currently ' routinely commission ' the surgery , bosses said
mr @entity7 , from @entity204 in @entity348 , said : ' it seems i would be fine if i needed a gastric band if i had eaten too much '
@entity6 spokesman said it is likely the procedure will become available at a number of centres later this year once its effectiveness has been established
