previously unnoticed audio from a video recorded in the chaotic moments after @entity4 's fatal shooting last saturday in @entity5 , @entity6 , could help back up @entity5 police officer @entity8 's version of events			1
overheard while one man films the gruesome aftermath of @entity4 's daylight shooting , the barely discernible audio is of one unseen man recounting the alleged version of events that he saw to another man , off camera , while bystanders scream and shout at police to assist the stricken 18 - year - old			1
at around the six minute and 30 second mark in the 10 minute long video , one man is just heard over raucous shouting asking another how @entity4 ended up at least 30 - feet away from the police squad car that presumably was being driven by @entity8			1
warning : @entity25 and @entity26 the body of @entity4 lies on the ground in the aftermath of his shooting death the first man explains to the second man that @entity4 was there because he had previously been near the police car and run , which contradicts what the teens friend , @entity36 , has told police and in interviews			1
@entity36 has said that @entity4 was never inside or near officer @entity8 's police car before the shooting			1
@entity36 alleges that @entity8 exited his car and struck 6ft 4inch @entity4 as he was trying to open the door , setting off the calamitous series of events that ended with @entity4 running from a shooting @entity8 , before turning with his hands raised in surrender before being gunned down			1
the audio heard in the video gives a different version of events			2
the alleged witness tells the man that @entity4 apparently had a confrontation with @entity8 near to or in his vehicle and ran away			1
' then the next thing i know he doubled back towards him cus ( sic ) the police had his gun drawn already on him , ' according to blog , conservative @entity61			0
the witness then contradicts the now crucial narrative of the how the tragic events unfolded last saturday			1
heartbreaking photograph : a new image emerged of the scene immediately after the shooting of @entity4 today			1
the photo shows shocked onlookers watch as police peer at the teen 's dead body @entity5 police officer : @entity8 , 28 , pictured receiving a commendation for ' extraordinary effort in the line of duty ' in february has been named as the police officer who shot dead @entity4 , 18 instead of @entity4 being fired on while his hands were raised in surrender , the witness claims that @entity4 was moving towards the officer when he was shot			1
while this version of events does not match most of the eyewitness accounts , it does seem to tally up in a small part with the account of what occurred given by a friend of @entity8			2
begins at 6:28/6:29 of video man 1 : ' how ’d he get from there to there ? ' eyewitness : ' because he ran , the police was still in the truck – cause he was like over the truck ' eyewitness : ' but him and the police was both in the truck , then he ran – the police got out and ran after him ' eyewitness : ' then the next thing i know he doubled back toward him cus - the police had his gun drawn already on him ' man 1 : ' oh , the police got his gun ' eyewitness : ' the police kept dumpin on him , and i ’m thinking the police kept missing – he like – be like – but he kept coming toward him ( crosstalk ) ' eyewitness : ' police fired shots – the next thing i know – the police was missing ' man 1 : ' the police ? ' eyewitness : ' the police shot him ' man 1 : ' police ?

' and he shoves it away			0
and the gun goes off			0
' well , then @entity4 takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away			2
and , @entity8 ’s first protocol is to pursue			2

' and @entity4 taunts him … and then all the sudden he just started bumrushing him			2
he just started coming at him full speed			0
' and , so he just started shooting			0
and , he just kept coming			0
and , so he really thinks he was on something			0
' this new development follows photographs from last saturday that were taken in the minutes after @entity4 's death			1
they came as @entity6 governor @entity175 announced that he has signed an order declaring a state of emergency ' to keep the people safe ' and implemented a midnight to 5am curfew in @entity5 on saturday			1

unnoticed audio recorded in video filmed at scene of saturday 's tragic shooting contradicts claims made by friends of the @entity6 teen
the *scratchy* recording of the **conversation** between two men **suggests** a confrontation of sorts in or around officer @entity8 's car
despite being *difficult* to make out , the **conversation** **suggests** that @entity4 ran towards @entity8 before he was shot
officer @entity8 , 28 , was identified as the man who shot @entity4 on *august* 9
eight nights of *rioting* and looting have followed since
