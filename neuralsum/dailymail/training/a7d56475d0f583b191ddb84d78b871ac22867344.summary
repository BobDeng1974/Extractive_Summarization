both @entity6 and @entity7 have already started canvassing @entity2 about becoming the default engine on @entity22 devices and @entity23 , according to @entity25 's @entity24			1
mr @entity24 said @entity2 is likely to base the decision on the ' quality of the product as much as the potential money made from search ads. ' @entity1 reportedly paid @entity2 $ 82 million ( £ 52 million ) in 2009 , and $ 1 billion ( £ 636 million ) last year for the partnership			2

within @entity47 , local searches are made using services such as @entity49			0
the reports follow an announcement from @entity9 last week that it is ditching @entity1 as its default search engine			1
from the start of december , people using the browser in the @entity55 will be switched to @entity6 as the default service			0
@entity58 said the @entity59 will remain unaffected , for the time being back in 2010 , analysts at @entity62 claimed there was a 70 per cent chance @entity2 would launch its own mobile search engine by 2015 , and the impending end of the @entity1 and @entity2 deal has bolstered these claims			1
after a decade , @entity58 announced last week it is ending its partnership with @entity1 as the default option for @entity9 web searches			2
from the start of december , people using the browser in the @entity55 will be switched to @entity6			0
in @entity73 , @entity9 will start using local search engine @entity74 , and @entity76 will continue to be the default search engine in @entity78			2
@entity58 said the @entity59 will remain unaffected , for the time being			0
@entity9 is an open - source browser that was launched by @entity80 - based @entity58 in 2002			0

in november , @entity84 reported that a so - called web - crawling bot had been spotted on @entity2 's servers			0
this could be the start of developing its own search engine , but may also simply be used to boost its local and built - in search options			0
for example , @entity93 's @entity92 tool scours the desktop , but also the web , maps and @entity98			0
in 2013 , re / code reported @entity6 was ' aggressively ' working to increase revenue and the focus was to become the default on @entity2 products			2

five years ago , @entity6 signed a deal with @entity7 to have @entity16 to carry out behind - the - scenes indexing of online content			0

@entity6 boss @entity116 has repeatedly stressed that @entity6 remains devoted to the search market that the company pioneered , but which @entity1 eventually dominated			0
even if @entity2 does replace @entity1 as its default engine , users are expected to be able to revert back , or select an alternative in the browser 's settings			1
@entity1 told @entity124 is does n't comment on speculation			0
@entity2 has not replied to @entity124 's request for information			0
