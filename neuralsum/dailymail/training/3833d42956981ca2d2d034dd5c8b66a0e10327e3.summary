by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 9 february 2013 during the riots of 2011 , @entity1 turned @entity3 as others looted shops and vandalised property			1
he led an elderly woman to safety and searched a smoke - filled building for trapped inhabitants , with police thanking him for his efforts three times			0
but , despite his public - spirited bravery , mr @entity1 suffered months of misery after the @entity17 mistakenly put his photograph on a ‘ @entity20 ’ poster – and failed to remove it despite numerous complaints			1
wrongly wanted : @entity1 , 49 , pictured in the @entity17 wanted poster that wrongly identified him as a rioter now the 49 - year - old has launched a libel case against the police , seeking up to £ 50,000 in damages for what he says was a serious smear on his character which almost cost him his job and led to him enduring abuse			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , has served on a number of voluntary bodies as well as working for @entity38 , helping to manage council estates			1
according to his legal claim , submitted at the @entity41 , he had just finished work one day in early august , 2011 , when one of the worst waves of riots @entity43 had seen for years began			2
unable to drive home from work because of the disorder , mr @entity1 set off on foot			2
claim : he has launched a libel case against the @entity17 , seeking up to £ 50,000 in damages for what he says was a serious smear on his character which almost cost him his job and led to him enduring abuse when he saw a distressed woman in her 70s from one of the council estates he managed , he helped her to find her way home through the turmoil			1
he then spotted a bus driver , whose vehicle had been attacked by rioters , who was unable to drive on because of debris in the road			0
mr @entity1 reassured him and moved the obstacles			2
as the riot grew in intensity he saw a terrified woman clutching a baby in the window of a building as a torched car burned outside			0
realising she feared the flames would spread , he went in to help			0
once she was safely outside he scoured the premises , despite thickening smoke making breathing difficult , banging on doors to see if anyone needed to evacuate			0
according to his legal claim : ‘ on three separate occasions police officers thanked him for his assistance			0
’ but although mr @entity1 escaped any injury , he says his real ordeal was yet to begin – when at the start of may 2012 the police issued a ‘ @entity20 ’ poster with his photograph on it			1
under the heading ‘ @entity97 ’ , it declared : ‘ police in @entity34 are appealing for the public ’s help in identifying those involved in the disorder during august 2011			2
’ mr @entity1 ’s photograph was featured among those of a number of suspects			2
but he only found out when he went into a @entity107 and an assistant told him he was pictured on a poster in the foyer			0
his image was also on the police website , where it remained for six weeks			0
bravery : mr @entity1 was praised on several occasions for his acts of bravery during the @entity35 riots in 2011 alarmed , he swiftly visited @entity34 police station to make clear his actions during the riots			1
mr @entity1 claims he was told the posters would be removed within two hours , and after his bosses demanded proof of his innocence , officers provided a letter making clear he was eliminated from inquiries			1
detective sergeant @entity129 said at the time : ‘ the public - spirited attitude of this member of the public is outstanding and i apologise on behalf of the @entity17 for any distress caused			0
’ yet mr @entity1 says the ‘ @entity20 ’ image remained on display for more than three months , until a year after the riots			1
it also appeared in a local newspaper			0
he is seeking damages of up to £ 50,000 for libel and an injunction to stop police publishing any more defamatory allegations against him			1
