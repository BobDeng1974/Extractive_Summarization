by @entity0 published : 23:52 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 23 january 2013 forgotten man : the work of @entity3 , pictured , dubbed the ' forgotten father ' of evolution , is set to be celebrated by the @entity6 in @entity7 while his colleague @entity8 is revered as one of the greatest @entity11 scientists ever to have lived , @entity3 never became a household name			1
many believe the 19th century scientist , who may have even coined the phrase ' origin of species ' which became the title of @entity8 's earth - shattering theory , could be regarded as the ' forgotten father ' of evolution			1
he also came up with the concept of warning colouration in animals , and the @entity3 effect , a hypothesis on how species evolved			2
@entity3 also did extensive fieldwork , first in the @entity28 and then in the @entity29 , where he identified the @entity30 that divides the @entity33 archipelago into two distinct parts			0
the work of @entity3 is now finally set to be celebrated , 100 years after his death , in a series of events at the @entity6 in @entity7			1
a portrait of the scientist is to be unveiled in the museum 's @entity42 close to the famous statue of @entity8 by comedian and naturalist @entity46 tomorrow , and the museum will put an archive of @entity3 's correspondence online , as well as displaying some of his most important specimens			1
the @entity6 's @entity52 programme was organised to mark the centenary of his death in 1913 and put the biologist back in the spotlight			1
both @entity3 and @entity8 shared authorship of the scientific article that first proposed the theory of natural selection in 1858 , a year before @entity8 's book on the @entity59 came out and secured a place in history			1
@entity3 independently came up with the idea of natural selection and founded the science of evolutionary biogeography - the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals			0
he made a significant impact in fields as diverse as anthropology and epidemiology , and gathered thousands of previously unknown species in @entity79 and @entity80			0
overshadowed : @entity3 will finally step out of the shadow of @entity8 , left , when a portrait of him will be unveiled at the @entity6 in @entity7 by comedian and naturalist @entity46 , right celebration : @entity7 's @entity6 , pictured , is to celebrate the work of @entity3 100 years after his death @entity6 curator and @entity3 expert dr @entity87 said : ' this anniversary is a great opportunity to raise awareness of @entity3 's ground - breaking scientific work , his valuable collections which are still being studied today , and his amazing adventures in @entity79 and @entity80 in search of the process responsible for generating the astonishing diversity of life on @entity99			1
' @entity3 's remarkable accomplishments are not as appreciated today as they were in his own lifetime , and are often overshadowed by @entity8 's			1
' @entity3 will also be the subject of a @entity104 series to be screened in the spring and hosted by @entity46 , who is patron of the @entity105 which is raising money to pay for a life - size sculpture of the scientist			2
the ' @entity110 ' part of a collection of @entity3 's specimens which has been on display at the @entity6 in @entity7 previously born in 1823 , @entity3 was one of the 19th century 's most remarkable intellectuals			1
not only did he co-discover the process of evolution by natural selection with @entity8 in 1858 , but he also made very many other significant contributions , not just to biology , but also to subjects as diverse as glaciology , land reform , anthropology , ethnography , epidemiology , and astrobiology			0
his pioneering work on evolutionary biogeography ( the study of how plants and animals are distributed ) led to him becoming recognised as that subject ’s ‘ father ’			0
beyond this , @entity3 is regarded as the pre-eminent collector and field biologist of tropical regions of the 19th century , and his book @entity138 ( which was @entity139 ’s favourite bedside reading ) is one of the most celebrated travel writings of that century and has never been out of print			0
in february 1858 @entity3 was suffering from an attack of fever in the village of @entity146 on the remote @entity33 island of @entity148 when suddenly the idea of natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary change occurred to him			0
as soon as he had sufficient strength he wrote an detailed essay explaining his theory and sent it together with a covering letter to @entity8 , who he knew from correspondence was interested in the subject of evolution			0
he asked @entity8 to pass the essay on to lawyer and foremost geologist of his day @entity163 if @entity8 thought it was sufficiently interesting - probably hoping that @entity163 would help to ensure that it was published in a good journal			0
@entity163 ( who @entity3 had never corresponded with ) was one of the most respected scientists of the time and @entity3 must have thought that he would be interested in reading his new theory because it explained the ' laws ' which @entity3 had proposed in his ' @entity173 ' paper			2
@entity8 had mentioned in a letter to wallace that @entity163 had found @entity3 's 1855 paper noteworthy			1
unbeknown to @entity3 , @entity8 had of course discovered natural selection many years earlier			0
he was therefore horrified when he received @entity3 's letter and immediately appealed to his influential friends @entity163 and @entity180 for advice on what to do			2
@entity163 and @entity180 decided to present @entity3 's essay , along with two unpublished excerpts from @entity8 's writings on the subject , to a meeting of the @entity188 on 1 july 1858			2

the scientist shared authorship of an article proposing evolution theory
he may even have coined the phrase ' origin of species '
@entity3 's work is to be celebrated at the @entity6
series of events at the museum will mark centenary of the scientists death
