a teenage girl who is believed to have travelled to @entity1 to join the fight against @entity3 was identified yesterday			1
she is @entity4 , who went missing a month ago and is thought to be the first @entity6 female to volunteer against the fanatics			1
police have pinned an appeal poster to a noticeboard at the @entity11 in @entity12 , north @entity13 , where she was an active member			1
a @entity11 teenager from @entity13 who is feared to have joined the fight against @entity18 in @entity1 has been named as 17 - year - old @entity4 , pictured above describing @entity4 as a missing person , the poster says the teenager was last seen on the morning of october 27 at @entity22 international rail station			1
officers think she caught a train to @entity26 and then travelled to @entity1 probably via the @entity28 border			1
it is possible that @entity4 , who is a high achiever at school and hoped to become a human rights lawyer , wanted to join the @entity33 , an all - female militia protecting @entity35 from the @entity37 militants			1
however , according to her family , she went to @entity1 simply to carry out humanitarian work			1
her brother @entity40 told the @entity41 that their parents – @entity43 and @entity44 , both 51 – were unhappy about the posters			2
‘ we are not very happy about that because it has given an image of her that is wrong and upsetting , ’ said the 26 - year - old			2
‘ we are 100 per cent sure she has gone away to carry out humanitarian and charity work and not to become a fighter against @entity37			2
’ his sister has taken part in protests in @entity13 against atrocities by @entity37 forces			1
the @entity11 association ’s 50 - year - old chairman , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ she was upset about what has been happening to @entity11 people abroad			1
the police have called into the association twice in recent weeks looking for more information and they appear very worried about her			2
’ merciless : @entity18 fighters in @entity70 , @entity1 @entity6 police have arrested a man alleged to have helped the girl to travel to @entity26 from where she planned to join @entity11 guerrilla fighters , according to @entity76 , of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
he also said that @entity6 @entity35 are travelling to join the fight against @entity18 in @entity1			1
mr @entity76 told @entity78 : ‘ she was an activist and very politically in tune with the movement			2
‘ as many people are , she had a terrible feeling of impotence about not being able to do much here			2
she was very reserved and never discussed anything with people here			2
‘ afterwards when we realised she had gone , i spoke to a lot of individuals and no - one had any idea this was going through her head			2
‘ i ca n’t confirm that she has gone to fight or not because after she went everything went quiet			2
’ he said many in the @entity11 community felt the same : ‘ they are fighting for humanity and it is better to join the @entity11 @entity33 than to join @entity18			1
personally i believe that as long as it ’s not @entity18 , it is obviously better			2
’ mr @entity76 said he knew of others seeking to join the fight : ‘ this is a desperate situation			2
i have had cousins calling me up and crying down the phone , saying they ca n’t do nothing and the only thing they know is violence			2
police are trying to establish if @entity4 has taken up arms against @entity18 in @entity116 ( pictured ) ‘ i always say the power of the pen is more powerful than the @entity119 but the whole region is under threat			1
’ it follows the news that two former @entity125 soldiers have travelled to @entity1 to fight against @entity18			1
@entity126 , 26 , and @entity127 , 24 , are helping @entity11 peshmerga defend @entity116 from the brutal terror group , whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 @entity132 recruits			1
photographs posted on @entity134 show the pair on the @entity1 frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles , posing in bullet - scarred buildings			1
on the website of the security firm they founded , mr @entity126 and mr @entity127 said they were motivated by ' conscience ' , not money , to travel to the warzone ' to assist innocent people in the face of terror from @entity37 '			0
insisting they were volunteer fighters , not guns for hire , the ex-servicemen said they would ' not do nothing while innocent men , women and children are tortured and murdered by @entity3 while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill '			1
brothers in arms : @entity127 , right , with @entity165 @entity164 , who is also fighting in @entity1 @entity126 is helping @entity11 peshmerga defend the embattled city of @entity167 from the brutal terror group they add : ' this is not a religious war nor is it a racial war , this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity			1

speaking from her family home in @entity181 , @entity182 , 43 , said : ' he 's been in touch to say he 's okay , but i do n't like the fact that he 's gone there			0
it 's his life , but he 's my son			0

he wrote that the 's * * * hit the fan ' , prompting @entity164 , 28 , a @entity165 veteran wounded fighting with the @entity35 who is understood to have recruited the @entity6 , to reply : ' it 's always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head			0
' @entity220 , a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families , said : ' they are not being paid			0
they are not participating for any commercial gain			0
' @entity227 forces say they retook two towns north of @entity229 from @entity3 fighters today , driving them from strongholds they had held for months and clearing a main road from the capital to @entity235			0
there was no independent confirmation that the army , @entity240 militia and @entity11 peshmerga forces had completely retaken @entity242 and @entity243 , about 70 miles north - east of @entity229			1
many residents fled the violence long ago			0

@entity227 's @entity240 - led government , backed by @entity165 - led air strikes , has been trying to push back the @entity3 since it swept through mainly @entity263 provinces of northern @entity227 in june , meeting virtually no resistance			0
last week the army broke a months - long siege of the country 's largest refinery north of @entity229 , but @entity3 fighters continue to take territory in the western province of @entity271 , which shares borders with @entity1 , @entity273 and @entity274			1
the militants have been fighting in the last two days to take full control of the @entity271 provincial capital @entity278			0
on sunday , @entity227 and foreign jets struck @entity3 fighters near central @entity278 , provincial council member @entity279 told @entity282			0
clashes continued in the city , he said			0
@entity252 and @entity243 are located in @entity285 which is mainly under the control of the @entity229 government forces and @entity11 peshmerga			1
recapturing the towns would help secure the @entity11 - controlled towns of @entity294 and @entity295 to the north as well as nearby dams and oil fields , peshmerga @entity290 @entity289 said			1
it would also allow the road to be reopened between @entity229 and @entity295 , close to the @entity235 border			0
