by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 20:00 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 21:31 est , 13 april 2013 professor sir @entity3 told the @entity4 that care at the centre at the @entity8 children 's heart unit was ' on the edge of acceptability ' one of the country ’s most senior doctors who raised the alarm over high death rates at a children ’s cardiac unit is ‘ considering his position ’ after being asked to resign by the @entity19 medical director			1
professor sir @entity20 has called for prof sir @entity3 , the former heart tsar , to step down over his claims that he would still not want his daughter to receive treatment at @entity24 – even though it has reopened following a @entity27 review			1
the call for his resignation came despite health secretary @entity30 insisting that a new ‘ friends and family test ’ is a crucial way to determine whether services are safe to use			0
prof @entity3 , director of the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , which oversees @entity19 mortality data , argued on friday that the death rates at @entity8 were still ‘ on the edge of acceptability ’ and that he would not send his children there			1
‘ i would go somewhere else , ’ prof @entity3 said			2
‘ i would go to @entity40			0
’ prof @entity20 , who has insisted the unit is safe , described the comments as ‘ not very helpful ’ and was ‘ very puzzled ’ about why they had been made			0
asked if prof @entity3 should step down , he replied : ‘ i think the answer to that is yes			2
’ prof @entity3 said he was now ‘ considering his position ’ following the criticism , but he defended his comments over the @entity8 unit			1
he said : ‘ this is not just about data , where they are close to the levels which would prompt an alert , but about a whole range of things – concerns expressed by other surgeons about the way the unit operates , parents not being able to send their children elsewhere , women being cajoled into having abortions because their children have a diagnosis of congenital heart disease			1
children 's heart surgery at the hospital was suspended at the end of last month after data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres			1
it re-opened again on wednesday ‘ i am considering my position , but actually it really worries me that yet again we are seeing that when a person raises concerns they end up being vilified , just as @entity82 [ the anaesthetist who blew the whistle on the @entity85 baby deaths scandal , in which more than 30 babies died ] was			0
’ the latest war of words comes as one mother demanded a full investigation into her daughter ’s death at the @entity8 unit just days before all surgery was suspended there last month			1
@entity95 , 25 , lost her four - year - old daughter @entity96 following an operation on march 15 to remove a build - up of muscle on her heart			0
the little girl , who had a congenital heart condition , died on march 21			0
@entity95 , who also has a two - year - old daughter , @entity104 , told @entity105 : ‘ i have to know what happened – i think any parent would want that			0
the coroner could n’t find anything that would naturally cause her death so her organs have been sent to @entity114 specialists			0
i ’ve sent a list of 27 questions to @entity8 and just want some answers			2
’ @entity118 said : ‘ we extend our deepest sympathy to @entity96 ’s family and have been speaking to her mother about the family ’s concerns and have arranged a meeting with her next week to discuss these further			0
’ @entity127 's comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at @entity24			2
they want him to be sacked , accusing him of ‘ conducting a cynical vendetta ’			0
paediatric heart surgery at @entity8 was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by sir @entity3 appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average			1
surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive			0
but others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the @entity145 quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline children ’s heart services			0
the hospital insisted the data was incomplete and that full figures would confirm the unit to be @entity156 resumed earlier this week and @entity157 said it was satisfied that immediate safety concerns had been dealt with			2
however , sir @entity3 ’s comments on @entity160 ’s the report programme will reignite the controversy he insisted that , despite safety assurances , a comprehensive analysis of the data showed the unit should remain under supervision			1
‘ we find they ’re just on the edge of what we call an alert			0
‘ in other words , showing that they were right on the edge of acceptability , ’ he said			2
@entity176 said that the quality of its service had been independently verified during a rapid review			0
a spokesman added : ‘ this was publicly reconfirmed at a meeting of councillors in @entity8 on wednesday when the deputy medical director of @entity157 reaffirmed that all child heart surgery units in @entity157 , including @entity8 , are safe to undertake surgery			1
’ the @entity188 campaign group said sir @entity3 ’s involvement in deciding which child heart units should close means he is far from impartial			1
his comments , added spokesman @entity191 , were ‘ extremely unhelpful and undermine the progress made over the last few days to begin to rebuild heart patients ’ families ’ trust and confidence ’			2
@entity198 , @entity198 mp for @entity199 , called for sir @entity3 to be @entity200 said the remarks had caused huge and unnecessary distress to families as well as slurring the reputation of those working at the unit			1
@entity19 medical director , sir @entity20 , took the decision to suspend treatment at the unit but said he now ‘ disagreed ’ with sir @entity3			1
‘ having reviewed the unit , having reviewed the data , the performance in @entity8 is in keeping with good national standards and i would be very happy to have my child operated upon in @entity8 , ’ said sir @entity20 .			1
