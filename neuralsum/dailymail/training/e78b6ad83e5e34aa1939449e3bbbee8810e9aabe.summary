' we see the bouncy house come up off the ground and slam right back down to the place that it was and then it takes off about 60 to 70 feet in the air , ' one of the victims ' fathers told @entity31			1
it was then swept away by a gust of wind and they were thrown to the ground landing : the bouncy house can be seen between trees , where it landed after flying 60 feet in the air ' it travels maybe about 100 - 150 feet away and slams both of our children down into the ground			1
