a new study is backing up long held suspicions that @entity2 slows down older models of its iphones to encourage users to buy a new release			1
the @entity8 study analysed worldwide searches for ' iphone slow ' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new @entity10 launch			1
it then compared those results with similar searches for the term ' @entity18 slow ' , and discovered the term was unaffected by new releases from @entity18			1
a new study is backing up long held suspicions that @entity2 slows down older models of @entity4 to encourage users to buy its new release			1
the @entity8 study analysed worldwide searches for ' iphone slow ' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new phone releases the study , compiled by @entity31 phd student @entity29 , follows claims that the @entity34 - based company is deliberately sabotaging its old products			1
writing for the @entity36 , @entity37 , a professor of economics at @entity31 , described the results as ' striking '			1
' would n't many business owners love to make their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one ? ' mr @entity37 wrote			0
‘ when you sell the device and control the operating system , that 's an option '			2
the study then compared those results with similar searches for the term ' @entity18 slow ' , and found the term was unaffected by new releases from @entity18 while some @entity55 readers have n't noticed a slow down , others claim that @entity2 is sabotaging older phones through software updates			1
' this is common knowledge , ' one reader wrote			0
' if you want to keep your @entity10 running at the same pace do not do the software upgrade that comes out within six months of a new @entity10 release , ' last year , @entity66 , also writing in the @entity36 , raised concerns that @entity2 could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product			1
she said her @entity10 became a lot slower when she downloaded @entity72 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the @entity74			0
ms @entity66 accused @entity2 of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘ brainwash ’ its customers into buying the new @entity78 and @entity79 because they look nice			1
her claims fuelled conspiracy theorists who have long held that @entity2 engages in ‘ planned obsolescence ’ , a term which has been around since the @entity85 in the 1930s			1
the theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working , forcing consumers to buy a new one			1
and @entity2 has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before			1
last year , @entity66 , also writing in the @entity36 , raised concerns that @entity2 could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product a security expert has warned @entity2 ’s @entity72 software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on @entity10 and @entity106 users			1
speaking at the ' @entity109 ' conference in @entity110 , @entity107 said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for @entity10 data			0
he added files found hidden within the firm 's software contain a file - relay service that can be used to access the user 's address book , photos , voicemail and any accounts configured on the device			2
however , @entity2 has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for government or surveillance purposes			2
his investigation followed earlier reports of the @entity132 spying on @entity2 products , which suggested a ‘ backdoor ’ in @entity72 could provide hackers with valuable information			1
a backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources to access a device with little detection			0
the conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million @entity72 devices , with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk			0
when it started using more tamper - resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem			0
meanwhile , in 2012 @entity2 was sued in @entity157 by the @entity157 @entity158 over the launch of the @entity160			2
the organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the @entity163 redundant and that @entity2 was changing its devices too quickly			2
ms @entity66 said : ‘ when major innovations remain out of reach , and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers , companies like @entity2 can still take a cue from the fashion industry			1
‘ if you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons , you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base			2
@entity180 , managing direction of @entity183 - based @entity72 experts , creation application , told @entity55 that he does n’t believe @entity2 are doing this intentionally			0
‘ on every hardware release they tend to upgrade the chips and they are faster every time they are released , ’ he said			0
‘ each year they release a new @entity72			0
if you ’re running an @entity72 7 on a 5 chip , for example , it ’s comparable to running @entity195 on a windows 95 machine			0
‘ it ’s just enough to annoy the users , but it ’s needed if you want the slew of new features that @entity2 releases each year			1
’ mr @entity37 added that the research does not prove that @entity2 has done anything wrong			2
no matter how suggestive , he says , the data alone does n't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower			0
there are other explanations for why an older model @entity10 may slow down , he claims			0
for instance , the latest version of the @entity2 operating system , @entity72 , is always tailored to the newest device and may therefore not work as efficiently on older models			0
‘ hearing about a new release makes you contemplate getting a new and faster phone , ’ he added			0
‘ and you suddenly notice how slow your old phone is			0
’ @entity2 is yet to respond			2
but mr @entity37 added that the research does not prove that @entity2 has done anything @entity219 matter how suggestive , he says , the data alone does n't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower			0

the study was *undertaken* by student @entity224 at @entity31
it also compared @entity2 's results with searches for ' @entity18 slow '
@entity230 found that the term was unaffected by @entity18 new releases
study has fuelled suggestions @entity2 engages in ‘ planned obsolescence ’
theory states that manufacturers build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working , forcing consumers to buy a new one
