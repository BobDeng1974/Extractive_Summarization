by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 07:52 est , 11 february 2013 actor @entity1 has attacked social news network @entity2 , accusing it of allowing racism , bigotry and sexism , in a post on the site itself			1
the @entity9 legend , who joined the online community after a q&a session in january , posted a request to turn off private messages from users which turned into a full - blown hit on the site 's hands - off approach to moderating its content			1
the 81 - year - old @entity21 said he was appalled that ' horrifically racist , sexist , homophobic , ethnic ' posts were ignored			1
appalled : @entity1 , pictured with his wife , @entity23 in 2005 , has hit out at social news network @entity2 for not moderating its content , leaving it open to racism , sexism and homophobia @entity2 is an online community where users are free to share links and post commentary on any subject			1
@entity1 has been a member since he took part in an @entity2 ( @entity2 ) session in the @entity9 subreddit in january			1
he posted a post entitled ' turning off private messages ' on saturday asking for a way to avoid receiving private messages from users , having been swamped with emails from fans asking for autographs and favours			1
his attack came in the comment field below after a fellow @entity2 user pointed out some of the ' unsavoury aspects ' of the site			2
mr @entity1 wrote : ' i am apalled ( sic ) by some of the immature , horrifically racist , sexist , homophobic , ethnic ... etc.			0
posts that are just ignored here			2
why are these accounts still active ? ' trekkie fans : @entity1 , famous for his role as @entity55 in @entity9 , became a @entity2 user for a q&a session last month and , unlike many celebrities who part - take in such , has remained an active member ' while @entity2 has done well in getting interest from the mainstream i just wonder if by allowing these children to run rampant and post whatever they feel will cause the most collateral damage if @entity2 is biting off it 's own nose in taking that step to become a mainstream community			1
' @entity2 users were quick to hit back at @entity1 , saying censorship through moderation goes against the sites policies and that internet hate is a downside of freedom of speech			2
user ' froggymorning ' said the hateful posts would not be tolerated offline and ‘ would earn you swift action from your parents ’ if said in public , but added that ‘ the internet has no parents and is a relatively free speech zone			1
’ @entity2 is a social news website which uses the slogan front page of the @entity82			1
it functions like a mass blog which you can browse both as a user and as a non-user			0
contributors ' posts can be a news story , a link , a picture , a written piece etc , and is then given up - or down - votes by others regulating which posts become a ' hot topic ' and move up on the site			1
the comments on a post are organised in best , top , new , hot , controversial and old			2
there are also forum - like categories for posts on a specific subject which are called subreddits			1
these can be created by a user and come in a wide variety of topics such as @entity111 , world news , gif - images and gaming			2
there are currently over 67,000 different subreddits on the site			0
others took a more hardline stand in defending @entity2			0
‘ nothing on @entity2 is a “ free speech zone ” , ’ replied user @entity120 , explaining that it is up to the creator of a subreddit to ban re-posts from the forum to @entity126 or @entity127 , giving users and moderators the opportunity to censor racial hatred , homophobia and sexism			0
' this idea of freedom of speech on @entity2 , a privately - owned website , is bulls * * *			0
’ mr @entity1 replied that @entity2 was the first ‘ mainstream site ’ to allow ‘ racists and other hate mongers to group , congregate , incite and spread their hatred			0
‘ what mainstream sites do you think are more racist ? ' ‘ the fact that someone could come here , debase and degrade people based on race , religion , ethnicity or sexual preference because they “ have a right ” to do so without worry of any kind of moderation is sending the wrong message , in my humble opinion			0
’ ‘ i do n’t pretend to know where the managers of @entity2 wish to go with this site but embracing that kind of culture i feel is counterproductive to where this world is heading and i think that is probably hurting this site			0
’ others sympathised wholeheartedly with mr @entity1 saying freedom of speech is being used as an excuse to get away with anything from sexism to inciting hatred and using slurs against users who dare criticise			0
‘ i love @entity2 , but it 's wearing me thin , ’ wrote @entity176			0
’ @entity178 / @entity177 is one of the worst			0
i once saw a picture of a person 's 14 year old cousin 's still born baby posted there			0
' free speech : @entity2 has over 67,0000 categorised forums for specific interests , known as subreddits , the topic and moderation of which were questioned by mr @entity1 @entity2 calls itself ‘ a pretty open platform and free speech place ’ and uses a handful of rules and a reddiquette which it asks its users to abide by			0
it ’s reddiquette section asks members to ‘ remember the human ’ and consider the person behind the online moniker they are addressing and ask themselves ‘ would i say it to the person 's face ? ’ or ‘ would i get jumped if i said this to a buddy ? ’ @entity2 has previously found its moderation policies scrutinized , in particular the case of the exposure of one of its moderators @entity213 who posted on the site under the moniker ' violentacrez '			2
mr @entity213 , a 49 - year - old computer programmer , contributed anonymously as ' violentacrez ' to a number of controversial subreddits devoted to explicit materials and was the creator of subreddit r / jailbait which was dedicated to posting provocative pictures of teenagers			1
the thread was shut down after journalist @entity226 condemned it on his @entity227 show @entity226 360 in late 2011 , after which ' sexually suggestive content featuring minors ' was officially banned from the site			1
mr @entity213 's identity was exposed by blog @entity127 in october last year as it questioned the site 's decision to give moderator status to a user who posted explicit and sexist material , and as a result mr @entity213 lost his job .			2
