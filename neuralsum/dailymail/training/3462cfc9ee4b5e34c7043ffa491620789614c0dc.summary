by @entity1 reporter published : 06:07 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 21 september 2013 comedian @entity2 has slammed the ticket policy of the theatre company where he is performing , describing booking agents as ' parasites ' that rip off fans			1
the married former @entity9 presenter - who quit the progamme in 2011 after being outed for sending graphic text messages to other women - is back on the stand - up trail			0
however , there was nothing funny about his comments regarding the management of @entity21 's @entity20 company over their cut of his ticket sales			0
disgusted : comic @entity2 launched an extraordinary @entity26 tirade at the @entity27 over its ticket policy @entity2 queried why the management were adding a £ 9 booking fee to the £ 22.50 face value price of the ticket , as well as taking a 20 per cent cut of the sales			1
controversy : @entity2 may be performing at the @entity27 , but that did n't stop him laying into its policies he took to his @entity26 page and advised people not to book the tickets in that way and he would ' of course put on my best show as i do every night '			1
he wrote : ' please please please do not buy these tickets			0
these booking agents are parasites of the highest order , overcharging you and making it look like it 's the performer			0
' i can only apologise for the people already booked , @entity54 bless you , i will of course put on my best show as i do every night			1
' i just wish i 'd have spotted it bloody sooner but all that is left to promoters and such like but just know that after this tour i will never play an @entity60 venue again until they lower their preposterous booking charges			2
' i mean , you do it all your f * * * * * * self ! ' that 's what gets me , you log on , you choose your seats , you even print the b * * * * * d out at home ! what are they charging for ? ! ! ? ' how are they getting nearly half of what i get when i 'm the one who spent a year writing and perfecting it , driving to the gig , paying travel , accommodation , tour manager , promoters , agents , advertising , not getting to put my kids to bed 6 nights a week for 10 months ! ' i do my best to never rip anyone off but this makes my blood boil			0
i 'm kicking myself for not noticing it sooner ! argh ! sorry ! ' he added : ' i 'm very angry about the booking charge that @entity60 add on to the face value of the ticket price			2
attack : @entity2 , centre , pictured on the set of @entity99 , says the booking fees imposed on fans for big live events are a disgrace and has urged them to make a stand @entity106 is no stranger to controversy			1
in 2011 , he quit @entity9 after being outed for sending sex texts to other women ' i deliberately lowered my ticket prices for this year 's tour because of theatre booking fees			1
' people work so hard for their money and to put an extra charge on top of the ticket prices really got me			0
' why charge a booking fee when it is all done online and you even print the tickets at home ? ' @entity60 said it would not respond directly to his remarks but said : ' all , or the vast majority , of the sales income from the ticket goes to the producer , hence the need to charge for ticketing operations separately			2
' however , booking fees only apply to customers who buy on the phone or online			1
' the range of fees can vary depending on show genre and ticket price			0
' the @entity139 star is due to appear at the @entity27 , @entity140 , @entity21 , on monday and again on tuesday .			0

he slams @entity27 over £ 9 charge and urges fans not to book
' i do my best not to rip anyone off and i 'd wish i 'd noticed sooner , ' he says
*wonders* why booking fees exist when people buy tickets online
despite row , he vows to ' put on my best show , as i do every night '
