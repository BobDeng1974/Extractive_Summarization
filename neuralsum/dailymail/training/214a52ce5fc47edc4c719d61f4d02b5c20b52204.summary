by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 07:40 est , 25 september 2012 a new mother was scarred for life after an allergic reaction to her son while he was still in the womb			1
@entity6 , 20 , from @entity7 , developed a burning rash all over her body while pregnant with @entity10			1
doctors believe she has a rare intolerance to testosterone , which was produced by her baby as the foetus grew			1
greatest reward : @entity6 at home with baby @entity10 , now one , whose hormones caused her an unbearably painful allergic reaction when he was in the womb the first - time mother noticed the rash when she was 20 weeks ' pregnant and was soon crippled by searing pain and unbearable itching			1
she was in so much discomfort she even told boyfriend @entity25 , 21 , that she thought having a termination might be the only solution			1
' the pain got worse day by day , ' she said			1
' it started when i was 20 weeks ’ pregnant and was at its worst at 30 weeks			1
' my skin was on fire			1
if i touched anything it was agony			1
i could n’t sit down or keep still			1
all i could do was itch and cry - it felt like someone was ripping my skin off			2
' i tried wearing gloves , but nothing stopped me digging at my skin			2
all i cared about was scratching , and everyday tasks became impossible			2
' i felt like my body was telling me i should n’t be a mother			1
sheer agony : the 20 - year - old said the severe rash made her feel as though someone was ripping her skin off ' even though i was too far into my pregnancy , i still begged @entity25 for an abortion			1
i was n’t thinking straight			2
i regretted ever getting pregnant in the first place			2
' she pleaded with doctors to help but no - one could tell her the cause or suggest treatment			1
' my gp told me it was the worst case she ’d ever come across			2
i saw ten different doctors , and no - one could tell me what caused the rash			1
' i was prescribed all sorts of antihistamine creams but nothing made the slightest bit of difference			2
' @entity10 was born on may 6 - and only then was ms @entity6 referred to a dermatologist at @entity67 , who suggested a rare allergy was to blame			1
she was diagnosed with @entity70 ( @entity71 ) , which usually affects only first - time mothers and flares up in the later stages of pregnancy			2
her legs are now pockmarked with sores caused by constant scratching			2
@entity79 reminder : ms @entity6 has been left with permanent scars on her legs after the ' nightmare ' pregnancy ms @entity6 , who works as a dog groomer and has no history of allergies , said : ' the dermatologist examined me for allergies and discounted the most common ones			1
' he said he was certain the rash was caused by an allergic reaction to testosterone which was produced while @entity10 was growing inside of me			1
' he said it was very rare to have an outbreak as bad as mine , but in the handful of similar cases , the women have gone on to have boys			2
' i was told if i did n’t stop scratching immediately , i would have to be bandaged up			0
' i ’ve ruined my skin			0
the scars are very deep and , unfortunately , they ’re never going to heal properly			0
' i ’m absolutely gutted			0
i ca n’t wear dresses or skirts any more			0
when i wore shorts in summer , people stopped me in the street and asked me questions about the marks			0
' most women lose their confidence because of stretch marks , but mine ’s been ruined by the damage to my legs			0
when on the rare occasion i go out , i have to cover up			0
' @entity71 , which affects around one in 300 pregnancies , is still not fully understood by medical experts and there is currently debate over whether the sex of the baby is a cause			0
huge relief : ms @entity6 with her son @entity10 and partner @entity25 after the birth dr @entity126 , consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the @entity128 , said : ' pep is more common in the first pregnancy , and occurs more commonly with multiple pregnancy - twins or triplets			1
' there is some debate over the role of foetal sex , and i did some research and wrote a paper where i showed that @entity71 was more prevalent in women carrying male foetuses than females			0
' this was supported by another study but has not been confirmed in any subsequent studies , so the conclusions are not clear			0
however , no studies have looked at the role of testosterone			1
' director of clinical services at charity @entity149 @entity148 said : ' if there is an existing chronic condition , such as an allergy , pregnancy can have an effect			0
some people experience really bad reactions , but sometimes the opposite is true and their symptoms improve			0
' however , there are no studies or figure relating to allergies to testosterone			1
' her symptoms are gradually easing but ms @entity6 still compulsively scratches and fears she will never be able to return to pet grooming , as shampoo and other cleaning agents now severely irritate her skin			1
she said : ' whenever i get into the bath or use baby lotion the itching comes back			0
i ’ve accepted that it ’s something i will have to live with			0
' i tried to find other women who have experienced the same situation , but i did n’t find much on the internet			0
thankfully , the dermatologist has been brilliant			0
' i wanted a girl but , despite everything , i ’m so glad i ’ve had @entity10			0
it ’s been a nightmare , but i would n’t change a thing			0
' after the birth i swore i would never have any more children , but i ’m starting to feel a bit more confident , and we ’re already considering having a second child			0
' i ’m scared my symptoms will return when i have more kids , but i wo n’t let it put me off			0
despite my bizarre allergy , having @entity10 is still the best thing i ’ve ever done			0

painful and itchy rash began covering @entity6 *'s* body at 20 weeks
doctors believe she is intolerant to testosterone produced by the foetus
