by @entity0 she has worked in farming for almost four decades - and is patron of nearly 50 organisations in the @entity5 countryside			0
but tonight , princess @entity6 was happy to speak out about gassing as the most humane way to cull the badger population			2
the princess royal said she supported the controversial method - deeming it a ' much nicer way ' to kill badgers than shooting			1
voicing her opinion : princess @entity6 has cited gassing as a ' much nicer way ' to cull badgers than shooting in an interview with @entity22 's @entity21 programme , she said : ' most of the people who did [ badger culling ] in the past will tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it , if that 's not a silly expression , because of the way it works			1
' and how it works is that you go to sleep , basically			0
i do n't believe that shooting was ever a particularly good way of dealing with it			2
' princess @entity6 runs the sprawling @entity42 estate in @entity43 , where bovine @entity44 has wiped out a third of one of her herds in the past two years			1
she said she thought badgers were a ' source ' of the @entity44 outbreak due to their increasing population - adding that the rise in numbers could cause problems for other species such as hedgehogs , bees and ground - nesting birds			1
interview : the princess royal told @entity22 's @entity21 that the gassing method was like ' going to sleep , basically ' health risk : she said she thought badgers were a ' source ' of bovine @entity44 due to their increasing population appearing on the @entity22 show , the princess royal also said genetically modified crops ' have a role to play ' in helping feed the world , putting her at stark odds with her older brother @entity73			1
the @entity75 's daughter admitted she seldom discusses the issue with the @entity77 , who once suggested the method risked creating ‘ the biggest disaster environmentally of all time ’			1
she said new methods were needed to ensure the world 's population is adequately fed , adding that those who are opposed to the idea have to accept @entity87 crops will be cultivated			1
speaking out : appearing on the @entity22 show , she also suggested that eating horsemeat is ' worth looking at ' as a way of reducing the numbers of neglected or abandoned horses			2
above , @entity6 with her horse on camera : ' the meat trade adds value to the animals so there is some point in keeping it healthy , ' she said during the extraordinary interview , princess @entity6 also suggested that eating horsemeat is ‘ worth looking at ’ as a way of reducing the numbers of neglected or abandoned horses			1
she said : ' the meat trade adds value to the animals so there is some point in keeping it healthy if there 's an end point it can go to			2
' she added that she had tried eating horse meat in past - and had found it tasted ' very good '			1
home : princess @entity6 has run the sprawling @entity42 estate in @entity43 for nearly 40 years princess @entity6 's comments about gassing badgers came after environment secretary @entity115 refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls			1
an independent report found that the ‘ controlled shooting ’ used so far has not been an efficient or humane way to reduce the number of badgers in the @entity121			2
her remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists , who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane			0
at odds with @entity73 : the princess royal also said @entity87 crops ' have a role to play ' in helping feed the world an independent report published on thursday found that the badger cull in @entity136 and @entity43 had been marred by poor marksmanship			1
badgers had in some cases taken longer than five minutes to die and far too few animals were killed			0
controlled shooting - the shooting of free - running badgers - was not an efficient way of killing the animals , the report found			2
princess @entity6 's comments about gassing badgers came after environment secretary @entity115 refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls professor @entity148 , senior research fellow at the @entity149 , said : ‘ gassing badgers was government policy in the 1970s , and reports of the time are full of frustration about how it just was n’t very effective			2
‘ sub-lethal concentrations of gas were inhumane			0
that ’s why gassing was banned by ministers in 1982			0
‘ the problem seemed to be that badger setts are built to hold warm air in and keep cold drafts out - so it was very difficult to achieve lethal concentrations of gas			0
’ she added : ‘ culling works against the grain of badger ecology and behaviour			0
‘ it ’s much more promising to explore the possibilities for vaccination , which could potentially exploit the same aspects of badger biology to improve the effectiveness of @entity44 control			0
’ meanwhile , @entity179 , of @entity180 , said : ‘ it is extremely disappointing that a prominent member of the royal family should endorse the gassing of a supposedly protected indigenous wild mammal			0
‘ gassing experiments carried out at @entity187 in the early 1980s were abandoned because of the appalling levels of suffering to which the badgers were exposed			0
‘ any attempt to reintroduce gassing would doubtless result in a slow and painful death for many badgers , and potentially other non-target animals			0
’ but tonight , the princess royal backed the gassing method - and claimed that she did not think her willingness to cull badgers was incompatible with her passion for wildlife			1
she also advocated the use of land for smaller rural developments , built in groups of ' about ten ' with proper telephone and internet access .			0

princess royal described gassing as ' much nicer way ' to cull badgers
claimed that shooting was ' never a good way ' of dealing with problem
added that she thought badgers were ' source ' of outbreak of bovine @entity44
during interview , she also said @entity87 crops ' have role ' in feeding the world
in contrast , prince @entity73 warned they risk ' big disaster environmentally '
@entity75 's daughter also suggested that horsemeat was ' worth looking at '
she said she had tried the meat before - and found it tasted ' very good '
