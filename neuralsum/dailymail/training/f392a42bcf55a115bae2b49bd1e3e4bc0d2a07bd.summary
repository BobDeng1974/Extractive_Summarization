by @entity0 last updated at 4:38 pm on 20th february 2012 @entity1 has revealed its new title , @entity3 on sunday , will be published for the first time this weekend			1
the newspaper will fill the gap in the market left by the @entity8 , which closed last year as the phone - hacking scandal unfolded			2
and with a fresh crisis gripping @entity3 following the arrest of ten current and former journalists , a defiant @entity13 has decided now is the time to launch its new stablemate			1
mr @entity13 , who flew into the @entity16 on thursday to take personal control over the latest scandal to hit one of his titles , will be in @entity21 for the launch , an internal memo sent to all staff at @entity1 has revealed			1
all smiles at @entity3 : @entity13 smiles confidently as he leaves his home in @entity27 and heads to @entity3 's office yesterday speculation has begun as to who will edit the new title			1
this morning @entity33 , @entity34 political correspondent and former @entity8 journalist , tweeted : ' i 'm told by @entity1 sources that @entity38 will be editor of @entity3 on sunday			1
' mr @entity38 is currently editor of the sun. it is not known if he would edit both titles			2
the launch comes at a time of high tension at the paper			0
journalists at the tabloid are angry that @entity50 ’s @entity49 gave police information – including the identity of sources – that led to the arrests , which include the deputy editor , picture editor and chief reporter			2
the @entity49 , which was formed to clean up the company following the phone - hacking scandal , is trawling through internal emails and passing details of suspected illegal activity to @entity64			2
investigation : a detective leaves the home of @entity68 , @entity3 crime editor mr @entity13 has moved to quell growing disquiet at @entity3 by lifting the suspensions of all arrested staff			1
ten current and former senior reporters and executives have been arrested since november over alleged corrupt payments to public officials			2
it remains to be seen however whether that will be enough to rebuild trust between management and journalists			2
as he lifted the suspensions , the media mogul pledged ' unwavering support ' for his journalists - but reiterated his desire to root out wrongdoing at @entity1			1
yesterday 's email revealing the launch said : ' @entity13 said during his visit on friday that a new sunday title would be published " very soon " - and that is a week from today			1
@entity13 will be staying in @entity21 to oversee the launch			1
' speculation about a sunday edition of the biggest selling @entity16 daily newspaper has been mounting since the closure of the @entity8 during the hacking scandal			2
the email from @entity97 , @entity1 's chief executive , acknowledged the parent company 's previous wrongdoing and said it was ' fundamentally changing '			1
it read : ' as you know , @entity50 has made clear its determination to sort out what has gone wrong in the past and we are fundamentally changing how we operate as a business			1
' the commitment of @entity50 to invest in a new edition is the strongest possible message of support we could wish for			0
' he told staff they would have to act quickly over the coming days			0
' this is our moment , ' he wrote			0
' i am sure every one of us will seize the opportunity to pull together and deliver a great new dawn for @entity3 this sunday			1
' journalists at @entity3 , which is owned by @entity1 , have said they are the victims of a ' witch - hunt ' @entity13 is not under any legal obligation to hand over to police any evidence of wrongdoing by his journalists , despite his insistence he is , a leading human rights lawyer has said			1
the @entity1 boss used a letter to staff explaining his actions relating to the arrest of a number of @entity3 journalists			1
@entity13 told staff that the @entity49 , which has given up evidence that has led to the arrest of nine @entity3 journalists in the past month , would continue to disclose material to the police because the company was ' obligated ' to do so			1
but @entity140 ( pictured ) has said that @entity13 's letter ' is full of errors , both of law and history '			1
he told the @entity146 that the media baron was ' ill - advisedly and unethically throwing away the shield that parliament gave to journalists in 1984 so they could protect their sources '			0
@entity13 's email to staff said : ' we will turn over every piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but because it is the right thing to do , '			1
he added that he would ' continue to ensure that all appropriate steps are taken to protect legitimate journalistic privilege and sources ' but warned he ' can not protect people who have paid public officials '			0
@entity163 said : ' apparently , he thinks it is right to hand over confidential source material – including the names of whistleblowers – to police without them even asking			0
' this is a breach of the most fundamental ethic that journalists must not betray their source and there is no law that requires it			0
' on the contrary , the 1984 @entity176 defines confidential journalistic material as “ excluded material ” , which police can not seize at all , other than in a few cases such as official secrets , when they have to get an order from a circuit judge			0
' @entity185 , the former political editor of the @entity8 , who is now associate editor at @entity3 , told @entity34 : ' it caught me by surprise			2
' mr @entity13 came round the editorial floor on friday and said he was launching it very soon			1
' we heard rumours of a date in april			0
this evening , astonishingly , we are told it 's going to happen next week			0
' he added : ' we do n't even know what the staffing levels will be at this stage			0
' i 'm told there will be extra staff taken on but this is not the @entity8 in another guise , this is @entity3 publishing on another day			1
' @entity38 , the editor of @entity3 , described it as a ' truly historic moment ' in newspaper publishing			2
he said : ' our readers ' reaction to the announcement of a seventh - day @entity3 has been huge and we wo n't let them down			2
' it is believed that there will be a senior role at the new title for @entity215 , the @entity217 deputy editor , and current editor of the saturday edition of @entity3 while @entity33 added on @entity221 : ' i 'm told there will be " some sharing " of @entity3 staff across the daily & sunday editions			1
this will have big implications for the industry			0
' staff have accused the company of a ‘ witch - hunt ’ after the @entity49 passed information to police that led to the journalists ' arrests			2
but he warned : ' we will obey the law			0
illegal activities simply can not and will not be tolerated – at any of our publications			0
' in an email , the 80 - year - old @entity50 chairman said recent events were ' a source of great pain for me , as i know it is for each of you '			0
' i ’ve worked alongside you for 43 years to build @entity3 into one of the world ’s finest papers			2
it is part of me and is one of our proudest achievements , ' he said			0
the @entity259 has arrested and bailed the ten @entity3 journalists			1
all were immediately suspended on full pay in the wake of the arrests			0
but mr @entity13 said he was doing ' everything to assist ' them , including paying their legal fees			1
he said they were free to work until any formal charges are made against them			0
despite the invitation , it was not clear if all ten journalists - many of whom were arrested in raids on their homes - would return to work after it was reported that some were considering their options			2
@entity1 journalists fear further arrests			1
the heavy - handed police tactics have drawn strong criticism , with the yard accused of diverting officers from murder , rape and terrorism investigations to join ‘ @entity290 - like ’ raids against journalists			0
mr @entity13 , who dramatically closed down the @entity8 last july at the height of the phone - hacking scandal , insisted journalists ’ ‘ legitimate ’ confidential sources would be protected			1
but he wrote : ‘ we will turn over every piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but because it is the right thing to do			0
‘ i made a commitment last summer that i would do everything i could to get to the bottom of our problems and make this company an example to @entity305 of ethical journalism			0
’ despite mr @entity13 's charm offensive , many were still furious about the treatment of their colleagues at the hands of the @entity49			1
in a sign of how low relations have sunk , one senior staff member dubbed former editor of the @entity314 , an @entity49 member , the ' chief witch hunter ' and said there would be demands that he be sacked			0
@entity13 touched down at @entity321 in a private jet before being driven to his @entity21 home sources close to the investigation believe they have uncovered evidence of ' serious suspected criminality over a sustained period ' by some public officials supplying @entity3 with information , dismissing the suggestion from some reporters that they were being investigated over ' trivial ' matters , such as £ 50 lunches with sources			1
the @entity49 has been feeding @entity335 , the police investigation into corrupt payments , with information over the past few months			0
in all , 21 people have been held			0
the five members of @entity3 staff arrested last weekend were deputy editor of the paper @entity342 , chief reporter @entity344 , picture editor @entity345 , deputy news editor @entity346 and chief foreign correspondent @entity347			1
also held in the dawn raids were a 39 - year - old @entity350 employee and a 36 - year - old member of the @entity352			0
in january , senior members of @entity3 's newsroom were held by police and later released on bail			2
they were head of news @entity358 , executive editor @entity360 , crime editor @entity68 as well as former managing editor @entity361 and a 29 - year - old police officer			0
in july last year , former chief executive of @entity1 and @entity365 editor @entity364 was questioned by detectives as part of @entity335 and those involved with @entity369 , the investigation into alleged phone hacking by journalists			1
