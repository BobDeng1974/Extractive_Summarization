by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 10:11 est , 13 january 2014 the family of a pregnant @entity4 woman being kept alive by a ventilator are suing the hospital that is refusing to turn off her life support , against their wishes			1
mother of one , @entity10 is 20 weeks pregnant and has been in hospital since november , when she suffered a pulmonary embolism			1
her relatives say doctors have told them that she is brain dead			1
but @entity18 is refusing to allow them to take her off life support , saying that @entity23 law prohibits it from following a family directive when a pregnancy is involved			1
tragedy : @entity28 found @entity29 on the kitchen floor in late november			1
she 'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain			1
she was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness questions : in @entity23 , state law stipulates that , in cases of pregnant women , @entity37 do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus			1
meanwhile , it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when @entity10 's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period the woman 's husband @entity47 , who has and mother @entity49 are now taking legal action against the hospital , also in @entity52			1
attorneys for the family told the @entity55 : ' we do plan on filing some litigation , and it will be filed soon			0
' the lawyers would n't give further details but said they are ' making progress ' on the case			0
a spokesman for the hospital welcomed the move			2
' @entity66 is encouraged by this development because the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity , direction and resolution in this matter , ' @entity65 said			0
' @entity66 remains focused on providing compassionate care to all patients while also following the law as it applies to healthcare in the state of @entity23 , ' he continued			2
normal heartbeat : for now , the baby in @entity10 's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term happier times : @entity47 ( right , holding their 1 - year - old son @entity85 ) says his wife @entity10 ( left ) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine			1
but because she is pregnant , @entity23 law requires she receive all life saving measures the hospital is pointing to a provision of the @entity94 that reads : ' a person may not withdraw or withhold life - sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient			1
' but experts interviewed by @entity100 , including two who helped draft the law , said a brain - dead patient 's case would n't be covered by the law			1
' this patient is neither terminally nor irreversibly ill , ' said dr. @entity107 , clinical director of the office of clinical ethics and palliative care for @entity111			0
' under @entity23 law , this patient is legally dead			1
' @entity112 , a @entity113 law professor , said he did not believe the law applied in this case			0
he said the hospital would not have absolute immunity from a civil or criminal case if it went outside the subchapter referenced by the law , but noted that ' most medical decisions ' are made without immunity			2
@entity10 's mother @entity122 says she was shocked to learn her state left the family powerless to carry out their daughter 's wish to never be dependent on a ventilator because she is pregnant			1
in december @entity122 lashed out against the law , saying that it had put her family through ‘ pure hell			0
’ ‘ the doctors told us that even if a pregnant woman has a dnr or a living will , the law supersedes that , ’ @entity122 told @entity137			2
@entity122 ’s son - in - law @entity47 found @entity29 on the kitchen floor two days before @entity139			1
@entity28 is a paramedic - as was @entity10 - and immediately performed @entity140 , but it was no use			2
at 14 weeks pregnant with their second child , @entity10 had been without oxygen for an hour			1
‘ they did a @entity147 scan and an eeg and there was no brain activity , ’ @entity122 said			0
‘ she was clinically declared brain dead			1
' i do n't agree with this law ' : @entity28 says he ca n't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the @entity23 law , which applies to all pregnant women , even those with do not resuscitate orders ' we knew what her wishes were ' : both @entity28 and @entity10 were both paramedics			1
he found her collapsed on november 26 and initiated @entity140 , but it was no use			1
@entity28 says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they would n't want to be kept alive by machines unfortunately your browser does not support @entity173			0
@entity10 had suffered what was likely an embolism			2
she has been unconscious ever since and remains on a ventilator			0
the family has no idea whether the child sustained severe damage while deprived of oxygen			2
all they know is that they are powerless over their daughter ’s fate or that of the unborn fetus			0
' knowing our daughter is not there , but her body is being kept alive , is hard to see , ' @entity122 told @entity192			0
@entity10 must remain on life support until she miscarries the fetus or until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks			2
‘ at that point they would decide whether to start labor , do a c - section , or see if she could go to 34 or 36 weeks when the fetus would be full term , ’ @entity122 said			2
but she and her family are horrified things even got this far			0
‘ no family should have to go through this , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s been pure hell			0
’ ‘ i do n't agree with this law , ’ @entity47 told @entity209 as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1 - year - old son @entity85			2
@entity28 says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation			0
and this is n’t it			0
' they do n't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen , ' @entity28 said ‘ we knew what her wishes were , ’ @entity28 told @entity226			2
the couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive by a machine and had n’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order			0
but that would n’t have made a difference			0
@entity23 gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother ’s wishes even when a @entity242 has been signed , where the state ’s form reads , ‘ i understand under @entity23 law this directive has no effect if i have been diagnosed as pregnant			1
’ doctors said the baby has a normal heartbeat , though it remains unknown how it was affected when @entity10 ’s brain was deprived of oxygen			1
‘ they do n't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen , ’ @entity28 told @entity209			0
‘ but i 'm aware what challenges i might face ahead			0
’ ' i 'm aware what challenges i might face ahead ' : though he does n't agree with the laws , @entity28 says he 's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle			0
