it took @entity1 52 seconds to confirm his @entity2 well - being as @entity3 signed off for the finals on a comprehensive note in the @entity6 against a ragged @entity7			1
out of action since the @entity10 final , @entity1 ripped through the @entity12 defence with his first touch to spear a shot on target			2
the message was clear – @entity1 was back			0
in front of @entity18 , his former @entity19 comrade , @entity1 smacked the post , made an assist , and twice went close from open play as he showed enough of his repertoire to indicate he will carry a serious threat in @entity25			0
goals : @entity37 3 , 37 , @entity71 og 19 , @entity62 77			1
@entity7 : @entity46 ; @entity72 ( @entity73 76 ) , @entity48 , @entity74 ( @entity75 67 ) , @entity76 ; @entity77 ( @entity78 76 ) , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 ( @entity82 67 ) ; @entity83 ( @entity18 64 ) ; @entity84 ( @entity85 63 )			1
goal : @entity81 52 referee : @entity88 ( @entity89 )			1
attendance : 46,063 the 29 - year - old @entity91 also shipped a couple of hefty @entity12 challenges which certainly tested his fitness after knee and thigh problems			2
wisely , @entity99 coach @entity98 withdrew @entity1 just after an hour on a newly - laid surface that was a slow , spongy , and a hazard throughout			2
' yes , it was important that he played and we would not hide it , ' @entity98 said afterwards			0
' a player like @entity1 is important for any team , and that 's the case for us			2
it 's good that he is back			0
' too often , players lost their footing and it was a blessing that no one picked up an injury			0
twenty years after their @entity2 win over @entity115 in the old @entity116 , the @entity12 were cut down to size as they slipped to their most comprehensive defeat under @entity119			1
but for the first half heroics of @entity46 in the goal , the margin of defeat would have been greater for a team which played , at times , as if the summer break was on their minds			0
after a lusty rendition of ‘ @entity130 ’ sung by @entity131 from @entity132 , the @entity99 fans had reason to cheer @entity1 ’s early surge , and an early goal			0
it came inside the third minute when @entity30 lost possession – this became a worrying trend – and @entity61 crossed from the right for the unmarked @entity37 to head home			1
after a double save from @entity46 to deny @entity1 and @entity64 , who also returned after injury , @entity3 doubled their advantage when @entity48 deflected @entity60 ’s left - wing delivery beyond @entity46 into the top corner			1
disallowed : @entity19 winger @entity65 rolls an effort into @entity46 's net but it was chalked off captain fantastic : @entity1 's return marked a major improvement in @entity3 's attacking play the one - sided nature of play continued when @entity1 struck the butt of the upright before the @entity159 star found the target with a header which bounced off @entity46 into the path of @entity37 , who snapped up his second goal of the night			1
there were few positives for @entity119 , who sprang a surprise by leaving out @entity167 from the starting xi and giving @entity84 the armband and the lone ranger role in attack			2
it was only the second time in 13 years that @entity18 did n’t start when fit – the last occasion was for a friendly against @entity176 12 months ago			2
@entity119 says he knows what @entity18 can do but the omission of @entity30 ’s record goal scorer and most capped player is a perhaps a clue to @entity119 ’s thoughts for the @entity184 qualiifers			1
@entity18 will be 34 next month and needs to be used sparingly for the campaign			0
he was missed as the @entity12 lacked bite in the final third , although things improved after the break when @entity81 grabbed a consolation goal from a quickly taken free - kick in the 52nd minute			1
it was @entity81 ’s first goal on his 23rd appearance			2
while @entity83 grafted in midfield and @entity48 ’s bravery was without question , the @entity12 conceded two more goals after a raft of substitutions late on through @entity62 and @entity60 as @entity119 was left to reflect on a worrying run of six games without a win			1
@entity204 's welcome : @entity159 's @entity1 was greeted by fans as he came out to warm up ahead of the game response : @entity1 was playing his first game since the @entity10 final as he returns to fitness middle man : @entity37 controls the ball between @entity213 pair @entity79 ( left ) and @entity48 hard work , that ! a shattered @entity76 shakes the hand of @entity1 after the crushing 5 - 1 defeat ' i thought we started nervously , and that was something we wanted to try and avoid , ' @entity119 reflected			1
' two of their goals came from our possession , which we gave away needlessly			0
' those are the things that over the course of the @entity229 championships you have to try and cut out			0
i thought we came to grips with it - we got the goal back and looked dangerous at times			0
' we were still trying to chase it to get back to 3 - 2			0
when i finally sit down and analyse it , there should be things i am happy about and obviously things we need to improve			0
' i feel it is not disheartening in the sense that it was 3 - 1 and if we shut up shop , it is 3 - 1 and it does n't seem so bad			1
' i am not too bothered			0
i have done this before at club level , trying to chase games and stay as positive as possible , and considering the changes that we made and some of our main players not playing , i do n't think this will kill us off			0
' all smiles : the big win gives @entity253 's side a boost ahead of their @entity2 opener against @entity54 tussle : full back @entity60 tries to wrap his leg around @entity72 in a bid to win back possession			1

@entity3 beat @entity30 5 - 1 in @entity261
@entity159 star fit to start after knee *tendinitis*
@entity37 grabs two goals in *comfortable* win
@entity269 and @entity60 also on target
@entity81 scored consolation for @entity119 's men
@entity3 face @entity54 on monday in first @entity2 match
