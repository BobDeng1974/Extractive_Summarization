while dogs may learn about their world mainly through their nose , it appears cats prefer to rely on their eyesight			1
domestic cats are known to have a sense of smell that is around fourteen times stronger than humans			1
however , in a test to find out what is the dominant feline sense , scientists found the animals tend to use their eyesight to find food			1
the eyes have it : cats tend to rely on their acute eyesight when searching for food rather than their nose however , when deprived of the ability to see their food , cats revert to using their noses - especially if they have already learned what the food smells like			1
large boxes , shoe boxes , and even just items that look like boxes â€“ cats , it seems , ca n't resist squeezing into cardboard spaces			2
scientists believe cats may be instinctively drawn to boxes because they offer security and shelter from predators while they stalk their prey			0
veterinarian @entity41 of @entity42 in the @entity43 recently studied stress levels in shelter cats			0
she discovered that cats who had boxes got used to their new surroundings faster than those who did not because the boxes acted as a coping mechanism			0
boxes may also offer safe places for cats to take a nap			0
felines can sleep for 18 to 20 hours a day , so seeking out a hidden place would help their chances of survival in the wild			0
they could also be trying to escape unwanted attention			0
according @entity60 : the biology of its behaviour , cats do n't have good conflict resolution strategies and running and hiding is a coping mechanism for this			0
professor @entity69 , a researcher in veterinary behavioural medicine at the @entity71 who oversaw the work , said : ' we tend to think of cats being very influenced by smells			1
' we do wonder if it might partly be a result of domestication , as dogs too seem remarkably visual compared to wolves , but that really is speculation			0
' if it is related to domestication , it might be because our faces are such a rich source of information for our pets			0
' cats are known to have particularly acute vision and are able to see clearly in just one sixth of the light we need to see			1
smell is also important - which is why they often rub against objects and owners - while their hearing is also usually sharp			0
however , little was known about which of their senses is the most dominant			0
the researchers , whose study is published in the journal of @entity107 , placed six cats in mazes that had presented them with two alternative choices			2
the cats were offered two pieces of paper at the same time containing a different picture of an object and odour			2
choosing one combination of odour and visual stimuli won the cats a treat , while the other did not			2
after the cats had learned the rules , the researchers then mixed up the visual and odour stimuli so that the smell that lead to the treat was with the picture that did not and vice versa			1
@entity90 ' sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than humans but it is not their dominant sense it seems the scientists found that four of the six cats chose the visual cue that had led them to the treat over the smell			1
one of the cats tended to pick the route that contained the paper			1
when the scientists then removed the visual cues altogether and gave the cats a choice between smells , the cats consistently chose the smell that had been associated with a treat			1
professor @entity150 said that it showed that while many cats used vision as their dominant sense , smell was still important to them			1
when they are first born kittens are blind and so rely upon smell to learn about the world around them but as they grow up their vision becomes more important for hunting and finding food than their other senses he said the findings may also explain why some cats have a tendency to scent mark new objects when they come into a home and others do not			1
he said : ' one thing to realise is that some cats are very smell focused and others are more visual			2
' so two individuals may respond very different to a similar change in the environment			0
' for example we know many cats will spray on a new bag or article brought into the home , and perhaps this is because the cat is a smell orientated cat , whereas to a visual cat this is not as meaningful			2

researchers at the @entity71 tested how cats search for food
they placed cats in a maze , giving them pictures and smells to find treats
most of the cats tended to rely upon the pictures rather than the odour
@entity90 sense of smell is fourteen times more *powerful* than the human nose
their eyes are able to see clearly in a sixth of the light humans need to see
