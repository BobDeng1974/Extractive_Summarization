new dad @entity0 dedicated his match - winning try to his new son @entity3 as @entity5 ’s men began their @entity7 campaign with a comprehensive win at the @entity9			1
@entity10 produced a faultless kicking display and set up @entity0 ’s second - half try in a game that struggled to catch fire but was lit up briefly by the @entity16 half - backs ’ second - half combination play			1
with @entity21 ’ defence charging up , former @entity19 fly - half @entity10 chipped deftly over the top before gathering his own kick and grubbering the ball through for @entity0 to chase			1
the @entity26 scrum - half , who is expected to start across the road against the @entity19 on november 8 , showed he still possesses electric pace to outstrip the @entity21 defence before gathering and touching down			1
@entity0 of @entity16 dives over for the only try at the @entity9 on friday night @entity16 full back @entity31 ( left ) is tackled by @entity21 winger @entity33 ( right ) care , whose partner @entity35 gave birth to the couple ’s first child a week ago , celebrated in style by rocking his arms in cradle fashion in dedication to his new son as @entity5 ’s men delivered an all - important @entity47 win			1
‘ i presume the baby celebration came out in force , ’ said @entity5 after the game			0
‘ i went up to @entity0 before the game and asked him if he was going to do what @entity52 did for @entity54 during a @entity55 when he celebrated in style			1
i was delighted for @entity0			1
he ’s had a few sleepless nights but he ’s loving every minute			0
’ at 34 , @entity10 is entering the twilight of his career			2
but he combined brilliantly with @entity0 and kicked seven from seven attempts for a personal haul of 20 points			1
he went past 400 @entity7 points for @entity16 in the process , while his 66th - minute double kick for @entity0 was a rare moment of brilliance in an otherwise attritional game			1
‘ our accuracy has been a big thing for us and something we ’ve worked really hard on , ’ said an elated care			0
‘ we knew if we kept hold of the ball we could give anyone a game and that happened tonight			0
we ’ve come out of it with four points and we ’re very happy			2
‘ @entity10 is pretty mature these days			2
he ’s a wonderful player , one of the best i ’ve ever played with			0
we ’re lucky to have him in our side			0
’ @entity82 of @entity21 is tackled by @entity31 in the opening @entity84 fixture @entity26 and @entity86 8 @entity85 charges at the @entity21 defence @entity5 went into the game admitting his side ’s @entity90 form — they lie seventh with three wins from six matches — has been below par this season			1
but he was delighted with this gutsy display			0
‘ we ’re really happy , ’ he said			0
‘ we had 77 per cent possession in the first half			2
our set - piece was outstanding			2
it ’s a building block , a start			0
they are a good , physical side and we ’re delighted to take four points to none			2
when you have n’t had a start to the season you ’d like , you need guys to put their hand up			0
’ friday night ’s display was still nowhere near as fluent as @entity16 would have liked but the @entity114 outfit will take enormous confidence from a highly professional performance against a typically physical @entity118 side			1
@entity21 ’ @entity121 - born scrum - half @entity119 , who qualifies for @entity122 next week , kicked all his side ’s points but was unable to inspire them to victory as @entity16 squeezed the life out of them with some intelligent kicking			1
‘ they just played a simpler game , ’ said @entity119			0
‘ they put a lot of pressure on us and i do n’t think we took the right choices in trying to transfer that pressure			0
’ @entity138 gave a typically workmanlike display on one @entity16 flank while @entity141 was named man of the match on the other			1
@entity5 ’s men still gave away too many penalties , but the win gives their campaign lift - off			2
@entity149 of @entity21 beats @entity16 second row @entity150 in the lineout @entity26 captain @entity138 tries to out - muscle the @entity21 back - row in the second half @entity16 fans will also be hugely encouraged by the display of centre @entity158 , who produced a more than tidy performance on his return to action more than a year after a serious neck injury			1
‘ it ’s incredible , ’ @entity5 added			0
‘ to be out for 14 months with a career - threatening injury and to get through like that was superb			0
he epitomises what you need to make it in professional sport			0
