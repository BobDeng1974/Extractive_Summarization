by @entity0 published : 20:58 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 16 november 2013 worrying : experts hit back at figures showing gp funds have dropped to 8.4 per cent of the budget patient care is being put at risk as the amount of @entity10 budget being spent on general practice is now the lowest on record , experts warn			1
just 8.4 per cent of the service 's allowance is put into doctors ' surgeries - down from 10.3 per cent in 2005			1
this is despite the fact that more than 90 per cent of the service 's care is through doctors ' surgeries			1
it is a worrying change that could have a dramatic impact on waiting times , forcing patients into overcrowded accident and emergency wards , the @entity22 warned			1
in a study with the @entity30 , the @entity22 attacked the leaders of the @entity10 for sending mixed messages about their priorities			1
polls carried out for the @entity22 over the summer found 70 per cent of @entity35 fear waiting times will worsen over the next two years			2
at least 80 per cent said they no longer had resources to provide high - level patient care and 47 per cent said they have had to withdraw some patient services			0
dr @entity42 , chair of the @entity22 , said : ' during the last nine years , gps across the country have had to cope with a growing and an ageing population , in which more and more people have been affected by multiple , serious long - term conditions - and yet funding for general practice has been slashed			2
' on the one hand , the people who run the @entity10 across the @entity52 say they want more people to be cared for in the community			0
on the other , resources have relentlessly drifted away from community - based health services towards more expensive hospital - based care			0
' the flow of funding away from general practice has been contrary to the rhetoric and has happened in the absence of any overall strategy as to how we spend the @entity10 budget			0
' the share of the @entity10 budget spent on general practice has slumped to the lowest point on record			0
fear : @entity22 found 70 per cent of @entity35 fear waiting times will dramatically worsen cutting queues : the @entity22 claims low funds for general practices will worsen the already crippled @entity79 queues ' the various @entity10 bodies and governments who decide how we divide the @entity10 funding cake in the @entity52 have inadvertently allowed a situation to develop in which funding for general practice is being steadily eroded			1
with services now at breaking point , it 's time to come up with a plan to turn the tide			0
' the @entity22 and @entity30 are launching a new campaign , @entity95 general practice , calling on the government to increase @entity10 spending on general practice across the @entity52 to 11 per cent by 2017			2
they claim the campaign could enable @entity35 to offer shorter waiting times for appointments , more flexible opening hours and more online services			0
dr @entity42 said : ' we need to increase our investment in general practice as a matter of urgency , so that we can take the pressure off our hospitals , where medical provision is more expensive , and ensure that more people can receive care where they say they want it - in the community			2

8.4 **%** of budget is given to doctors ' surgeries , which provides 90 **%** of care
@entity22 blasts leaders for mixed messages
they say low funds will put more pressure on crippled @entity79 wards
