health tourists taking advantage of free treatment on the @entity4 have cost the taxpayer £ 40million , it has been revealed			1
due to the lax system of checks carried out by gps and @entity11 hospitals , many foreigners are able to undergo often lengthy and expensive treatment then simply leave the country without paying			1
conservative mp @entity14 carried out a study of 118 health trusts which has revealed that up to 3,600 foreigners run up debts to the @entity4 of £ 1,000 or more each year			1
@entity19 : health tourists receiving treatment on the @entity4 and leaving without paying have cost @entity11 taxpayers £ 40million mr @entity14 is now calling on the government to introduce new laws to clamp down on patients from overseas who cheat the system			1
he said : ' @entity4 services are paid for by @entity11 taxpayers , who work hard and are proud of the health service that successive generations have built			1
' opening this up internationally , free of charge , is not fair on those who actually pay for it			2
' mr @entity14 wants all non-emergency hospital patients to provide passports or proof of residence before they receive treatment			2
and he believes gps need to carry out far more effective checks before they refer patients for treatment			2
under his proposals , @entity44 residents would also be charged a flat fee for seeing a gp			0
he added : ' gps are often the first point of contact with the @entity4 for individuals , and as such provide a gate keeping function			1
' at present anyone can register with a gp , and it is not obligatory for the practice to check whether or not an individual is entitled to free hospital care			0
' it is therefore entirely possible for a patient eligible for charges to be referred to a hospital for treatment , and not pay a penny , due to the necessary information not being transmitted			0
' mr @entity14 used @entity66 requests , to ask every @entity67 in the country how much they were owed by foreign nationals and how much of that had been written off			1
of the 118 trusts responded @entity71 were owed the most with more than £ 8million renmaining unpaid			1
the next two were @entity73 and @entity74 , who were owed around £ 3 million and @entity76 who were owed roughly £ 2.7million			2
earlier this week @entity80 's @entity79 programme revealed some health tourists are paying bribes of up to £ 1,000 to get onto gp surgery lists so they can claim free treatment			1
reform : conservative mp @entity14 believes gps need to carry out effective checks before they refer patients for treatment their investigation uncovered a thriving black market in which @entity4 staff are illegally accepting cash			1
once registered with a practice , patients are being seen by gps and then referred for hospital treatment worth tens of thousands of pounds			0
the investigation found one manager at a surgery in the @entity100 was offering to register an entire family from @entity102 for £ 5,000			2
research : conservative mp @entity14 carried out a study of 118 @entity4 trusts he also took £ 800 from a female undercover reporter posing as a health tourist to put her on the practice ’s list			1
the reporter claimed to be an @entity102 patient suffering from the back condition sciatica , which would n’t merit free treatment as it is n’t deemed urgent			0
but she was subsequently referred to hospital for an mri scan that would have cost the @entity4 £ 800 – the same as the cost of her place on the list			1
the unidentified manager told her it was ‘ good business ’ as she had already got her money back with the cost of the scan – and would be likely to benefit from more expensive treatment			0
the manager said : ‘ just with the scan you ’ve made your money			0
’ the investigation also discovered that ‘ fixers ’ – who are n’t employed by the @entity4 – are putting overseas patients on gp lists in exchange for cash			1
these individuals are likely to have close ties with managers or doctors within the surgery who agree to register the patients			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ this is nothing short of abuse of precious @entity4 resources			1
it ’s highly irresponsible of somebody to be making money out of patients who are vulnerable			0
‘ the law is clear : if you ’re not eligible for free treatment then you should be paying for it			0
’ only patients who have lived in the @entity44 for the past year can get free hospital treatment			2
but @entity4 staff will treat anyone whose condition is deemed life - threatening or urgent , including women giving birth			1
treatment at hospital @entity165 units and walk in clinics is also free for all			0
@entity169 have discretion about whether or not to charge patients who are not on their lists depending on how urgent they assess the patient ’s condition to be			0
but gp surgeries are not legally obliged to register overseas patients			0
in fact many do n’t , as they worry that if the patients are later referred to hospital , they wo n’t pay for the treatment			0
although hospital staff are meant to check patients have been living in the @entity44 for at least a year before treating them – unless they are urgent – many do n’t bother			2
so once patients are on gp lists , they can potentially be given thousands of pounds of hospital treatment without ever having to pay			0
for @entity191 residents , their home country will cover the cost of treatment in the @entity44 through the @entity195 health insurance card scheme			0
in addition , the @entity196 will not charge for treating certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and @entity200 to prevent them spreading			0
health minister @entity201 said : ' the @entity4 is not there to serve the health needs of the world and we will not tolerate abuse of the system , but it does have a duty to help anyone whose life or long - term health is at immediate risk without demanding a credit card up front			1
' last year we began a wholesale review of the current system to address concerns about access , cut down abuse and consider how best to ensure those who should pay do so			2

@entity222 mp carries out survey of 118 @entity67 to reveal *shocking* *statistic*
3,600 foreigners running up debts to the @entity4 of £ 1,000 or more every year
