by @entity0 anyone born after the year 2000 should be banned from ever buying cigarettes , leading doctors @entity3 today			1
the idea is to stop young people from ever starting to smoke - and the move could create the first ' smoke free generation ' , medics said			1
those at the @entity12 's annual representative meeting voted ' overwhelmingly ' in favour for a campaign to ' enforce the move			1
the proposed move would ' ban forever the sale of cigarettes to any individual born after the year 2000 '			1
eighty per cent of smokers start as teenagers as a result of intense peer pressure this would ' ban forever the sale of cigarettes to any individual born after the year 2000 ' , they said			0
presenting the motion dr @entity28 - @entity27 said : ' the level of harm caused by smoking is unconscionable			1
' @entity33 is a choice made by adolescents that results in an adulthood of addiction and an early death			0
' by banning the sale of cigarettes to people born after 2000 , we begin to create the first tobacco free generation			1
' he added : ' smoking is not a rational , informed choice of adulthood , eighty per cent of smokers start as teenagers as a result of intense peer pressure			0
' this proposal would gradually phase out the sale of cigarettes to the next generation , with no impact on current smokers			1
' as this generation reach 18 in 2018 they would be prevented from buying cigarettes for their lifetime in a move that would progressively phase out cigarette sales			1
' it is not expected that this policy will instantly prevent people from smoking			1
instead it aims to progressively de-normalise cigarette smoking			0
' the idea is to stop young people from ever starting to smoke - and help create the first ' smoke free generation ' speaking against the motion , dr @entity72 said the idea was ' idiotic ' adding : ' there is nothing as attractive to a young person as the command " do n't "			1
' dr @entity80 , from the @entity12 's junior doctors conference , added : ' figures show that 19 per cent of smokers are managerial or professional versus 33 per cent in manual classes			1
' i am not convinced that we as a trade union should be supporting policy which demonises and criminalises the activity of working people			2
' he added the prospect would be ' unworkable '			0
pro-smoking group @entity92 also spoke out against the motion			0
' @entity94 does n't work , ' said the group 's director @entity95			2
' it will create a huge black market in cigarettes and drive generations of adult smokers into the hands of illicit traders			2
' criminalising adults for buying tobacco is illiberal and impractical			0
' another motion was tabled calling on the @entity12 to to promote the legalisation of cannabis - but this was voted against			1
@entity110 , a retired consultant from @entity111 , said : ' cannabis use should be treated primarily as a health issue , not a criminal justice issue			0
' too often the focus on drug use and addiction is from a criminal justice rather than a public health point of view			0
' doctors see first hand the damaging effects of a system which seeks to criminalise drug users rather than a treat their addiction			2
' he added that existing drug policy is ' contradictory and ineffective '			0
@entity128 the number of drug users has soared in then lat 30 years , despite the introduction of tougher drug laws			0
dr @entity110 added : ' our policy makers are n't prepared to have a sensible , rational , evidence - based debate on drugs			2
' that 's not to say that cannabis use is n't dangerous			2
but the current law is n't working and only by adopting a different approach can we regulate , educate and exert a level of quality control			0
