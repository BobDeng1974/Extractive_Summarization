@entity1 ecologist @entity0 found that spiders thrive in @entity4 's rich suburbs spiders have embraced city life and are living it up in @entity4 's affluent suburbs as recent research found they are bigger and more fertile in these areas			1
the study revealed golden orb weaving spiders were particularly thriving in @entity12 - just a km away from @entity13 in @entity4 's eastern suburbs			1
the research , conducted by phd student @entity16 from the @entity1 , found the largest golden orb weighed three grams and was as big as the palm of her hand			1
and their webs can measure up to three metres			0
the smaller spiders were found in rural sites such as the @entity25 , near the @entity26 - north of @entity4 , where the smallest measured 0.5 grams			2
the study , published on wednesday in science journal @entity29 , discovered the commonly feared eight - legged arthropods preferred urbanised cities rather than country - living			1
ms @entity0 put this down to the fact that these fanged creatures enjoy living by the coast and big open areas			0
the golden orb spider are particularly fatter and more fertile as they prefer city living ms @entity0 further suggested the concrete structures help retain heat better than their natural habitat , which may give them more energy to reproduce and also help them survive longer than their six - month lifespan			2
she also found female spiders from the city had larger ovaries , which meant they either had larger eggs or were producing more offspring			0
ms @entity0 believes the findings could be the result of wealthier suburbs spending more money on land management , which creates a healthier habitat for spiders			0
she stressed that the increasing population of golden orbs in the city is highly beneficial for the ecosystem as they help control flies , mosquitoes and other insects			2
' it 's really not a bad thing that they 're getting bigger because they are such an important part of our ecosystem , ' she said			0
' it 's fascinating that these spiders are adapting and surviving in our ever - changing landscape and it 's something we should encourage			0
' the spiders are particularly fond of @entity12 , @entity4 's eastern suburbs , just a km away from @entity13			1

the research was conducted by phd student @entity16 from the @entity1
her study revealed golden orb weaving spiders are fatter and more fertile at @entity12 , @entity4 's eastern suburbs
she said this will help control pest like flies , mosquitoes and other insects
the findings were published in science journal @entity29 on wednesday
