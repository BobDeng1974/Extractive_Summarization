by @entity1 reporter published : 15:37 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 04:06 est , 16 december 2013 a troupe of daredevil monkeys have been caught on camera dive bombing 30ft out of a tree into alligator - infested water			1
the acrobatic animals showed off their impressive aerial skills as they crossed the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , with some mothers even carrying babies on their backs as they belly flopped into the water below			1
they pick a narrow section of the river to cross due to the alligators lurking below - flinging themselves as far across the river as they can before swimming to the bank and clambering up the trees to safety			1
@entity43 , who now lives in @entity46 in @entity10 , said : ' it happened in a split second so i had to shoot what i could - fortunately i had my camera close by and my wife was able to use her phone			2
' i 've travelled down the @entity9 numerous times over the last few years to photograph the wildlife residing along the banks of the river			2
' you 're never guaranteed to see the monkeys so when you do it 's a huge plus and a great experience - but this was something i have never seen before			0
almost there : the monkeys then swam to he bank and clambered out the other side dangerous : the monkeys choose the narrowest point of the @entity9 in @entity10 to cross ' the only way for them to cross the river is by swimming or attempting to jump from tree to tree on either side of the banks			1
' but in this case the trees were too wide apart so they had to jump 30ft and swim the rest			0
' the river is seven miles long and loaded with alligators - it 's infested			0
because it 's beginning to cool down now the gators must be starting to go into hibernation			0
' it 's possible the monkeys have worked out the threat is less so are happy belly flopping into the water			0
' family time : the mother and baby monkey cuddle up on the side of the river write caption here excited : mr @entity43 said it was a ' huge plus ' to see the troupe during his trip down river @entity43 uses a friend and guide when searching for the rhesus macaque at the river			2
' captain ' @entity103 , who has been running tours at @entity9 for 30 years , added : ' they are n't afraid of water			1
' the canopy was close together and so instigated by leaders of the troupe they flipped into the water one by one			0
