gluten - free products must in fact be free of wheat , rye and barley starting today - after a new @entity6 rule took effect			1
the @entity6 rule comes amid a growing dietary trend in the @entity10 in which an increasing number of people are ruling out foods that contain gluten			2
starting tuesday , food manufacturers must make sure that their products contain less than 20 parts per million of gluten â€” guaranteeing that those products are technically free of wheat , rye and barley			1
that amount is generally recognized by the medical community to be low enough so that most people who have @entity25 disease wo n't get sick if they eat it			1
currently , wheat must be labeled on food packages but barley and rye are often hidden ingredients			0
the standard will ensure that companies ca n't label products ' gluten - free ' if they are cross-contaminated from other products made in the same manufacturing facility			1
the rules do n't apply to restaurants , but the @entity6 is encouraging them to comply			2
this new requirement is especially important for people who suffer from celiac disease and do n't absorb nutrients well			0
they can get sick from the gluten found in wheat and other cereal grains			0
celiac disease causes abdominal pain , bloating and diarrhea , and people who have it can suffer weight loss , fatigue , rashes and other long - term medical problems			1
@entity25 is a diagnosed illness that is more severe than gluten sensitivity , which some people self - diagnose			0
ten years ago , most people had never heard of celiac disease			0
but awareness and diagnosis of the illness have grown exponentially in recent years			0
it 's not entirely clear why			0
some researchers say it was underdiagnosed ; others say it 's because people eat more processed wheat products , such as pasta and baked goods , than in past decades , and those items use types of wheat that have a higher gluten content			0
gluten - free foods have become big business in the last several years			2
millions of people are buying the foods because they say they make them feel better , even if they do n't have celiac disease			0
@entity97 of the @entity98 says the gluten - free trend has been good for those diagnosed with celiac because of the increased variety of options in the grocery store			2
but she said it also may have prompted some companies to lose focus on the people who need those foods the most			0
the new regulations are ' raising awareness that there is a disease associated with the gluten - free diet , ' ms @entity97 said			1
@entity116 , ceo of @entity117 , which owns leading gluten - free food companies @entity119 and @entity120 's , says his company 's products all have 10 parts per million of gluten , less than the new standard			1
he praises the @entity6 regulations for being a ' stake in the ground ' that can increase the integrity of the gluten - free market			1
' if consumers ca n't have confidence in the products long - term , it 's going to hurt the overall trend , ' mr @entity116 said .			1

any food labeled gluten - free must now contain less than 20 parts per million of gluten
products must be free of wheat , rye and barley
restaurants do n't have to *adhere* to new rule but @entity6 is ' encouraging them to apply '
people with @entity25 disease will suffer weight loss , fatigue , rashes or long - term medical problems if they consume gluten
