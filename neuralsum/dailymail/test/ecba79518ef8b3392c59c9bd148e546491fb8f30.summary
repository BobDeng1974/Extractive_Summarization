during that period , so many trains were arriving that often two would have to wait with closed doors as the first was ' processed , ' @entity15 testified at the @entity29 state court			1

the main gas chambers were located at @entity4			1
' the capacity of the gas chambers and the capacity of the crematoria were quite limited			1
someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but i did n't verify this			0
i did n't know , ' he said			0
' for the sake of order we waited until train 1 was entirely processed and finished			0
' @entity4 survivors describe their arrival as chaotic , with @entity22 guards yelling orders , dogs barking and families being ripped apart			0
but @entity15 , 93 , maintained the opposite , saying ' it was very orderly and not as strenuous ' on the ramp at @entity4			2
' the process was the same as @entity4 i. the only difference was that there were no trucks , ' he said during the second day of his trial			0
' they all walked - some in one direction some , in another direction ... to where the crematoria and gas chambers were			1
' @entity102 asked @entity15 whether he knew details about files kept at the camp in hopes of learning more about what diseases she and her sister , who both survived , were injected with survivors from @entity4 ( pictured ) , who are plaintiffs in the case , travelled from the @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity19 and elsewhere to attend @entity15 's trial between may 16 and july 11 , 1944 , @entity15 was on duty when 450,000 @entity2 were transported there , with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival			1

@entity38 , 81 , was one of the @entity2 who arrived at @entity4 in 1944			1
though she does n't remember @entity15 personally , she said she ca n't forget the scene			2
' everything was going very fast			0
yelling , crying , pushing ; even dogs were barking			0
i had never experienced anything that fast or that crazy in my entire life , ' she told @entity134 before addressing the court			0
her two older sisters and parents were taken directly to the gas chambers , while she and her twin sister , both 10 at the time , were ripped away from their mother to be used as human guinea pigs for notorious dr. @entity60 's experiments			1
' all i remember is her arms stretched out in despair as she was pulled away , ' @entity38 remembered			2
' i never even got to say goodbye			0
' @entity38 , who now lives in @entity146 , is one of more than 60 @entity4 survivors and their families from the @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity149 and elsewhere who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under @entity120 law			2
@entity4 survivor and plaintiff @entity153 ( right ) and her granddaughter @entity156 wait for the opening of the trial against @entity15 on tuesday @entity15 sits opposite @entity4 survivors @entity160 ( left ) and @entity153 ( right ) at the court room in @entity29 general view of the cout before the start of the trial against @entity166 @entity167 , who represents many co-plaintiffs , said he and his clients were happy @entity166 agreed to testify , but suspected he was withholding many details			1

@entity15 showed no reaction to @entity38 's statement and his attorney , @entity187 , said his client would try to answer what questions he could , but he did n't believe that @entity15 knew @entity60			1
@entity15 guarded prisoners ' baggage on the ramps , but his main task was to collect and tally money stolen from the new arrivals and then send it to @entity196 - a job for which the @entity120 press has dubbed him the ' accountant of @entity4			2
' while he previously testified he was ' horrified ' by individual atrocities he witnessed , he suggested wednesday his daily thoughts were more pedestrian , like when the guards heard a train loaded with @entity19 @entity2 would be arriving			2
' if this is @entity19 , they have bacon on board , ' he remembered thinking			0
though he was investigated twice before and no charges were brought , @entity15 was indicted under a new line of @entity120 legal reasoning that anyone who helped a death camp function can be accused of being an accessory to murder without evidence of participation in a specific crime			1
@entity15 , who worked for an insurance company after the war , has testified as a witness in other @entity22 trials			0
outside court , @entity38 said she wished @entity166 would use the trial to try and dissuade ' misguided young people ' today from becoming neo-nazis but she was still satisfied with his testimony			0

' maybe this is the best thing he has ever done in his life			0
