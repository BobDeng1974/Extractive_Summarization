emerging from his campaign bus with ‘ @entity2 ’ helpfully written on his hand , @entity0 had one simple job to do – convince @entity6 voters they should stay in the @entity7			1
but it was one simple job too far for the former deputy prime minister , who quickly seemed to forget his brief and instead caused division			1
clutching notes that reminded him that he was ‘ @entity13 and @entity14 ’ , he did n’t exactly have them rolling in the aisles when he told an already hostile crowd that the @entity19 and @entity6 football teams should be combined			2
@entity21 bruiser @entity0 appeared to have been given instructions not to forget to mention the cross-party @entity2 - with reminders on his notes and even the back of his left hand his scrawled notes also included references to being @entity13 , buying whiskey at the airport and how he was not planning to talk about currency uncertainties not content with that , he then suggested @entity21 voters were not clever enough to understand the arguments about independence , leading one senior party source to brand him a ‘ f * * * * * * moron ’			1
lord @entity0 , 76 , was in @entity40 , near @entity41 , to take on the @entity6 nationalists with only a week until the referendum , but he seemed to be stuck in general election mode , launching an attack on the party ’s @entity2 allies , the @entity48			1
at one point , @entity0 , who famously punched a man who threw an egg at him on the campaign trail , lost his temper and shouted in the face of a man who had heckled him			1
he turned to the man who had been chanting , ‘ thirty pieces of silver ’ , and said , ‘ listen , i ’d give you 30 pieces of silver to just shut up ’			0
the @entity21 peer was told ‘ you ’re mental ’ by a man in the crowd after he said @entity19 and @entity6 should unite their football teams in order to beat @entity66			1
‘ when i got on the campaign bus they told me it was the @entity73 ’s coach ? i ’ve got a revolutionary thought for you , ’ he told the crowd of both @entity68 and no activists			0
‘ perhaps if @entity19 and @entity6 together had one team , we could at last beat the @entity66 , who knows ? ’ he later claimed his remarks had been a joke , but added : ‘ there is a serious question there about whether @entity19 , @entity13 , @entity66 ( sic ) should be treated as separate teams in @entity84			2
' but i ’m not making that proposal			0
the national feeling in the countries is they would n’t want to			0
' they still want to shout for @entity19 even though we lose every bloody time			0
they want to shout for @entity6			2
’ the former deputy prime minister waved a copy of the @entity95 , which today published an article by prime minister @entity97 lord @entity0 was surrounded by no campaigners , as he insisted he would not talk about currency unions but about a more simple argument about why @entity6 was better off in the @entity7 lord @entity0 even suggested @entity19 and @entity6 should form a joint football team to ' at last beat the @entity66 ' the @entity21 has argued that in the event of a no vote there will be further devolution to @entity6 as they and their pro-union allies – the conservatives and @entity109 – have each promised this			1
but lord @entity0 cheerily went off - message , saying : ‘ when @entity97 is up here he talks about devolution			2
they fought us for 30 years on devolution			0
they do not believe in it			0
’ clutching a copy of yesterday ’s @entity95 front page featuring the prime minister ’s plea to @entity6 to remain in the @entity7 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i picked the @entity95 up , never been known to pick the @entity95 up			1
@entity97 says , “ do n’t rip our family apart ”			0
bloody hell , they ’ve ripped our families apart for decades			0
’ lord @entity0 then seemed to suggest the issues surrounding the referendum debate were too complex for @entity21 supporters			1
he said : ‘ i ’m not here necessarily to talk about the currency and all the uncertainties , most @entity21 voters will find that very difficult to understand			1
’ yes and no campaigners jostled on the streets of @entity41 , yelling slogans and trying to drown out lord @entity0 's speech the visit came as @entity138 gave a speech in @entity140 , near @entity41			2
the @entity21 leader was challenged by a party member who urged him to apologise for the lacklustre campaign			1
@entity144 told him : ‘ this might be the time to say we in the @entity21 miscalculated because we thought the message was clear about what we stood for and what we were promising in this referendum			2
‘ that message is coming out now with a timetable , but we have eight days to go			0
we have to try something different – we have to be honest and say , “ sorry , we got it wrong ”			0
’ mr @entity138 yesterday said he would be campaigning in @entity6 all week			0
a poll last night showed that support for independence among @entity21 voters had fallen from 30 per cent to 26 per cent in the past fortnight			1
better together leader @entity162 issued a grave warning to @entity6 about independence			0

former deputy prime minister tries to convice @entity6 voters
@entity0 also launched attack on @entity48 for ' ripping families apart
@entity21 has *drafted* in *big* beasts to *bolster* no campaign
