by @entity0 last updated at 1:51 pm on 7th february 2012 thousands of @entity1 stormed the beaches of @entity3 and @entity4 last night in the largest amphibious training exercise for a decade			1
troops from the @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , the @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 took part in the massive military operation near @entity18 , @entity4 and @entity19			1
the night exercise , known as @entity21 , pitched @entity1 from international forces in a fictional , friendly country called @entity24 whose neighbour , @entity25 , had been invaded by @entity27			1
storm : @entity1 help to move an artillery piece after landing on a beach near @entity18 , @entity4 , during the @entity21 exercise operation : amphibious assault vehicles storm the shore after driving off the @entity35 during the war games exercise cooperation : @entity10 vehicles and troops land from a @entity40 transport catamaran as the operation gets underway fast response : a @entity44 hovercraft lands on the beach in @entity18 as the simulated amphibious assault swings into action the @entity27 army was rapidly advancing northward along the coast to @entity50 , @entity4 , seizing its port and airport and the forces have been asked to halt the advance			1
nearly 30 ships and 20,000 service personnel have been taking part in the exercise as military leaders attempt to provide a more realistic scenario for how amphibious landings could be conducted in future			2
a new approach to the landings involves more reliance on allies and friendly countries , including making decisions on whether to stage ships in port or out to sea because of the potential disruption to a host nation 's economy			2
military : a @entity77 helicopter takes off from the @entity78 as eight countries took part in the largest amphibious assault for a decade new war : @entity10 troops prepare to storm a ' terrorist encampment ' after the fictional country of @entity25 was invaded by @entity27			1
right , @entity7 @entity1 wait to board a helicopter which will bring them into the action kitted out : @entity7 @entity1 board two helicopters as the initial landing stage of a week of war games exercises began yesterday mission : another vehicle carrying troops rolls off the hovercraft @entity97 assault : the @entity78 discharges @entity44 hovercraft as it stages operations off the coast of @entity4 duties : two soldiers clean weapons on their @entity105 assault vehicle on board the @entity78 the week 's exercises have been in the planning stages for several years , and they take place days before president @entity110 will submit his defence budget proposal to @entity112			2
chief of naval operations , admiral @entity113 , said : ' we did n't put @entity21 together to send a message to @entity112 , but there may be , you know , there 's always second - order effects			0
' @entity1 travelling on hovercraft from the @entity122 landed at @entity123 - a military base along @entity19			0
after unloading equipment , they moved 2.5 miles to raid a mock terrorist training camp as gunfire , pyrotechnics and noise filled the night air			0
scale : troops carriers drive along the beach after making landfall as 20,000 service personnel , including @entity1 , sailors and air staff , take part in the operation forward look : @entity141 calls out sightings on board the @entity78 in the @entity144 might : a crew members makes checks as a helicopter takes off carrying @entity1 exercise : a @entity151 landing craft lands in the dock of @entity10 ship @entity153 to load equipment getting wet : amphibious vehicles , with a soldier manning the guns , drive out of the surf with other warships in the background drilled : an @entity44 hovercraft goes back for another load of troops and equipment after making shore once clear , ' killed ' enemy combatants were searched for intelligence , civilians were evacuated and a booby - trapped weapons cache was blown up before the @entity1 returned to their ship			1
@entity1 have been fighting wars in landlocked countries like @entity174 and @entity175 for years , and many have never even set foot on a @entity151 ship			0
this is of particular concern as the military shifts its strategic focus towards coastal regions , including @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , which are drawing increasing attention from the @entity7 as part of the @entity191 's budget proposal , some ships will be retired earlier than expected while the purchase of others is being delayed			0
intelligence : trucks prepare to drive off the @entity44 after it made landfall			0
the week of exercises will also see @entity1 storm a fort from the air time to move ? a @entity202 sailor watches as a @entity7 hovercraft docks in the hold night fighting : an amphibious assault vehicle drives ashore as the sun sets in @entity4 discipline : a @entity7 sailor monitors his radar equipment and , right , @entity10 soldiers cover each other as they carry out a patrol on land equipment : weapons , helmets and binoculars sit on the deck as @entity1 prepare to disembark plans : a @entity13 lieutenant commander explains details of the mission to sailors amphibious assaults were common during @entity226 , most notably when @entity228 troops staged the @entity229 in @entity230 - occupied @entity10 in 1944 , as well as numerous landings on islands in the @entity233			1
since then , such landings have become far more rare			0
the @entity151 is concerned about developing an amphibious mindset and a memo last year urged every sailor in the @entity238 to read doctrine on amphibious operations as well as three books on the 1982 conflict between the @entity8 and @entity243 over the @entity244			0
later on this week , the international forces will stage an aerial assault and insertion of @entity1 launched from sea on @entity249 , @entity3 .			2

20,000 troops from eight countries take part in massive amphibious landing exercise in @entity4 and @entity3
