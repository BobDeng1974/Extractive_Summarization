by @entity0 published : 20:50 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 2 march 2013 defence secretary @entity1 has warned he will fight further cuts to the armed forces in chancellor @entity5 's forthcoming spending review			1
after @entity6 warned publicly last month that the military would not be immune from further financial retrenchment , mr @entity1 made clear that he would resist anything more than modest ' efficiency savings '			0
he instead demanded the welfare budget should be slashed instead			1
defence secretary @entity1 will resist any proposed cuts to the @entity13 in @entity5 's budget			1
in an interview with @entity16 , he said other conservative cabinet ministers believed that the greatest burden of any cuts should fall on the welfare budget			1
there was , he said , a ' body of opinion within @entity24 who believes that we have to look at the welfare budget again ' , and that ' we should be seeing welfare spending falling ' as a result of rising employment levels			1
he said the ' first priority ' for the government should be ' defending the country and maintaining law and order ' and that further defence cuts were not possible while meeting stated security objectives			1
' i shall go into the spending review fighting the case for the defence budget on the basis that we have made very large cuts to defence , we 've done that with the collaboration and co-operation of the military , ' he said			0
mr @entity1 said further defence cuts were not possible while meeting stated security objectives ' any further reduction in the defence budget would fall on the level of activity that we were able to carry out - the idea that expensively bought equipment may not be able to be used , expensively employed troops may not be able to be exercised and trained as regularly as they need to be			2
' i am not going into the spending review offering any further reductions in personnel			0
' mr @entity1 's comments are likely to be welcomed by @entity61 backbenchers who have been calling for a return to a core conservative values in the wake of the party 's trouncing in the @entity67 by - election			2
however they will also heighten tensions within the coalition , with the @entity72 resisting a further squeeze on welfare spending			0
it was being made clear mr @entity1 's comments were aimed particularly at the @entity72 following remarks by senior @entity72 ministers indicating that they believed welfare spending should be protected over defence			1
a @entity81 source said : ' there is a real concern that the @entity72 wants to protect the benefits culture at the expense of the armed forces '			0
former @entity87 , sir @entity88 , agreed with mr @entity1 's @entity89 told @entity90 5 : ' we have great capability gaps now , which we never had before			2
' for example , we have no maritime patrol aircraft at all , we have no aircraft that can go on carriers - in fact we barely have carriers any longer			0
' the army is now at a level , or will be shortly , it has never been that low for 200 years			0
that must surely worry people			0

@entity1 says welfare budget should be slashed to *reflect* ' rising employment '
minister says government 's ' first priority ' should be ' defending the country '
