amid the din and the disapproving cat calls making their way down from @entity5 , @entity0 will deliver his final instructions at @entity7			1
it is on the field , in the moments before @entity12 referee @entity11 gets this clash with @entity14 under way , when @entity17 ’s players will wrap their arms around each other			1
the pre-match huddle is famous at @entity21 — started here in the 90s when @entity24 was captain of the club			2
on tuesday , it is guaranteed to provoke a different reception			2
‘ it shows everyone wants to be vocal			2
it ’s something we will continue to do and it ’s really a reminder of the messages we have heard all week			0
what is said is between us			0
’ on tuesday evening , in the famous stadium ’s fevered atmosphere , the captain will have to shout to make himself heard			1
it promises to be full volume			0
away from the pitch there have been some softer tones , with @entity0 taking some of the younger players to one side and explaining the competitive nature of this fixture over the past few days			1
@entity67 , @entity37 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 were in the team that beat @entity73 3 - 1 on saturday			0
none of them faced @entity14 at @entity76 last august			1
there is a growing sense of maturity about @entity0 these days and he is increasing in authority as captain			1
when the @entity84 presented him with a cut glass crystal ball to commemorate his 100th appearance , his face was visibly moved by the sentiment			2
former @entity21 goalkeeper @entity89 , who played at the ground for four years , could start against @entity14 after @entity91 pulled out @entity0 , who is just six goals short of becoming @entity17 's record goalscorer , speaks to the media alongside his manager @entity40 the @entity17 squad looked relaxed ahead of the game but @entity0 knows the atmosphere will play a big part at @entity7 on monday night he graciously handed over an @entity17 shirt , signed by the whole squad , to a reporter who is heading for sunnier climes after this game			1
he then skilfully and respectfully body - swerved a question about any ambitions to finish his career north of the border			0
‘ some great players , the likes of @entity111 , who i played with , have come here , but it ’s not something i ’d talk about now , ’ he added			1
‘ i ’m focused on @entity17 and @entity116			1
’ intriguingly , he appears more at home with the national team these days than he does at @entity119 under @entity120			0
at the age of 29 , his future responsibility is to use his experience and standing in the team to help draw the best out of the players being promoted to the squad			2
he has been there , seen it and not quite done it on the biggest stage of all			0
a fine legacy would be to tease the potential out of the younger players in this squad			1
it seems faintly ridiculous to describe him as a pastoral figure , but that is what he is becoming around the @entity17 camp as he prepares to play for the 101st time			1
an empty @entity7 may not look too intimidating , but @entity17 will find themselves in a hostile environment @entity17 's younger players , including @entity146 and @entity67 ( centre ) will be in for a big test , according to their captain more experienced players like @entity151 and @entity152 will have to help their younger team - mates adapt to the atmosphere he also spoke warmly about his @entity116 team - mate @entity156 , showing support for the @entity14 midfielder after his successful recovery from a long - standing bowel condition			1
‘ first of all it ’s incredible for him to be playing again and to be back in @entity14 ’s team , ’ he added			2
‘ it shows the character and the type of player he is			0
obviously it was hard for @entity156 and his family , but he ’s come through that with flying colours			0
‘ he does n’t miss a training session			0
he ’s fit and he ’s ready to play , but he ’s playing for @entity14 and i ’m playing for @entity17			1
‘ we ’re great friends off the pitch , but for 90 minutes we ’re opponents			0
’ there is a sense of occasion about this fixture , a grand affair at one of @entity183 ’s sporting cathedrals			0
it should be a humdinger			0
@entity0 ’s best memory of the fixture dates back 18 years , when @entity17 midfielder @entity187 — then a @entity189 player — scored one of the great international goals			1
‘ the biggest memory for me is @entity187 ’s goal at @entity194 , ’ he added			0
‘ that is the highlight from the games i ’ve seen , but there will be many more before i was born			0
that goal is still fresh for me			0
’ another one like that would certainly silence @entity7			2
the @entity17 manager looks focused as he strides out onto the @entity7 pitch , with a banner behind him to remind @entity40 where he is			1
