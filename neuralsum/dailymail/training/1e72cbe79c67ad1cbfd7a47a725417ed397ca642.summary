rev @entity0 greets the congregation outside @entity2 's in @entity3 following the collapse of the trial only a few days ago , he was in the dock in a @entity8 trial , facing the prospect of years in jail for allegedly overseeing a ‘ conveyor belt ’ of fake weddings			1
but yesterday the @entity13 , 54 , was back in the pulpit at his @entity16 parish and smiling broadly			2
he was even blessed in front of the congregation by his bishop , despite being accused of running @entity21 ’s biggest bogus marriage racket in a £ 1million trial that collapsed last week			1
the @entity24 vicar said little about his legal difficulties yesterday , except to inform the parishioners that after three years of being suspended from work , he and his wife @entity27 , 49 , and four children are to take a month - long holiday – to @entity24			1
given that he was granted asylum in @entity21 after complaining of persecution in his homeland , it is a surprising destination			2
yet no more surprising than his triumphant return to his @entity39 church			2
mr @entity0 was accused of herding almost 500 couples up the aisle in just 15 months in a bid to make money for himself and give numerous @entity44 the right to stay in the country			1
but the case was suddenly ‘ stayed ’ last wednesday when the judge accused @entity50 staff involved in the prosecution of lying and concealing key evidence			0
numerous questions still remain over the vicar , however			0
weddings at @entity2 ’s in @entity3 rocketed from six a year to up to nine a day after he took over			1
brides and grooms were often virtual strangers to each other , with ill - fitting wedding dresses being shared and swapped in the lavatories			0
he had also been accused of siphoning off £ 70,000 in wedding fees to himself , and back to @entity24 , rather than to his diocese			1
and the @entity66 has learnt that he arrived in @entity39 in 1996 after ‘ abandoning ’ his @entity68 flock in the capital @entity70 , and that his @entity24 bishop did not believe he deserved asylum in @entity21			1
none of these tough questions was answered yesterday			0
instead , as 100 parishioners sat in the church , @entity78 @entity77 delivered a service full of praise for mr @entity0 – as the controversial vicar stood smiling beside him , clad in clerical robes			1
@entity77 , @entity78 , ( left ) welcomed the vicar back to the pulpit following the collapse of the @entity8 trial due to doubts cast over police evidence the bishop said he wanted to ‘ commend @entity0 and his family to your prayers and love ’ , and added : ‘ just as in these last few years of difficult times you have continued to worship @entity97 and to serve him , through this next period of transition i ask if you will continue to focus not on whatever happened or did n’t happen in court , not on the @entity50 , not on other people in the church or in your community , but to focus on @entity97 and @entity97 ’s love			1
look forward , not back , set aside recrimination and blame			0
’ he then complied with a request from mr @entity0 and his family for a blessing – during which they knelt in front of him			2
and the bishop clarified that he did not need to formally restore mr @entity13 to his post , saying that it happened automatically when the court case collapsed			0
outside the church , @entity116 refused to say whether he had any concerns about the explosion in weddings under mr @entity0 , or about the claims that £ 70,000 of funds due to the diocese had gone missing			2
the congregation of @entity2 's in @entity3 , south @entity39 ( pictured ) , were pleased to see @entity126 return speaking in the service , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i want to thank you brothers and sisters for praying for us			1
thank you for your support			0
i ’m not doing any interviews			0
’ approached outside and at the huge three - storey @entity135 vicarage he shares with his family – where they remained throughout his three - year suspension on full pay – mr @entity0 refused to answer any further questions			1
but some of the vicar ’s parishioners are standing behind him			0
social worker @entity145 , 35 , originally from @entity24 like many of the congregation , said he used to live close to the church – and despite moving to @entity149 had returned for yesterday ’s service			2
mr @entity145 said : ‘ before the @entity126 came here , this church was dead			0
when they talk about the number of weddings , why do n’t they talk about the number of funerals and baptisms ? ' they went up as well			0
what is the point of people coming to church when they are cohabiting , when they are fornicating ? the church is there to wed people			0

rev @entity0 was accused of carrying out *hordes* of bogus weddings
the 54 - year - old *evaded* persecution when a @entity8 trial collapsed
returned to @entity2 's in @entity3 , south @entity39 , to resume *duties*
