sing up , @entity1 fans			1
you 've never had it so good			0
that 's essentially what @entity5 was intimating to the @entity8 faithful when he complained about the noise levels at @entity10 on saturday			1
as @entity5 's side maintained their unbeaten start to the season against west @entity15 rivals @entity14 , no less , the atmosphere at the @entity10 was tepid , to say the least			1
@entity1 fans will argue that the @entity10 is always rocking when the big boys come to town , but should n't it be every week ? here , @entity20 lists 10 reasons why @entity1 fans should crank up the volume ... @entity5 takes his place in the @entity1 dugout ahead of his side 's 2 - 1 win over @entity14 on saturday 1 ) ' @entity5 ' as the song goes ... after years of hiring and firing , @entity28 finally came to his senses last year , made up with the @entity32 , flung open the @entity10 gates and sparked a nostalgic @entity1 love - in			1
a year or so on and that honeymoon period seems to be over			0
he may just be plain old @entity5 again but the enigmatic @entity37 is beginning to flex his managerial muscles after an ultimately disappointing first season back			1
oh , and he 's not @entity40			0
2 ) it 's just like watching @entity42 well , not the @entity42 we saw crumble at the last @entity44 , but @entity1 's football this season has been sublime at times			1
the hallmarks of @entity5 's first @entity1 side , who won back - to - back titles in 2005 and 2006 , were organisation and relentless consistency			1
but @entity5 's @entity1 @entity53 have been slick and quick			1
enough to make you stand up and sing , you 'd think			0
@entity55 celebrates scoring what would prove to be the winner from the penalty spot against @entity14 @entity59 has been a revelation in midfield since joining from @entity62 in the summer 3 ) champions elect on the evidence of the first 10 games of the season you 'd be mad to back anyone other than @entity1 for the title			1
@entity70 and @entity71 are dropping points left , right and centre , @entity69 are a shadow of the side that came so close to glory last year and @entity77 are even worse off at this stage of the season under @entity80 than they were under @entity81 12 months ago			2
4 ) @entity82 is back in a decade of unprecedented success @entity82 was the man who got the goals that won the trophies for @entity1			2
who could forget that night in @entity88 ? and those @entity90 heroics ? but after a hero 's welcome back in the summer , @entity82 has quickly been forgotten about			0
yes , he 's not had many minutes , but he was never going to at his age			0
the feelgood factor @entity82 's return brought with him has died down alarmingly quickly			0
the hype surrounding @entity82 's return to @entity10 has quickly dissipated 5 ) that midfield it cost @entity1 over Â£ 70million to unite @entity59 , @entity100 and @entity101 in the middle of the park but it 's already looking like a snip			2
aged 27 , 26 and 23 respectively , the trio should have several years together to work on what is already a seamless combination of steel , energy and style			0
@entity111 in @entity55 and @entity112 or @entity113 on the wings and you 've got enough to make most football fans audibly purr			2
6 ) @entity117 perceived wisdom has it that @entity1 would have won the title last year with a decent striker in their side , and they probably will do this time around thanks to one that 's more than decent			2
@entity126 is the sort of striker fans love : full of passion , wild celebrations and , most importantly , goals			2
there are 19 other @entity134 clubs that would love to have him in their side , but poor @entity137 has n't even got a song at @entity1 yet ... @entity126 is the striker @entity1 had been craving since @entity82 's first spell at the club ended @entity126 celebrates @entity1 's winner on saturday with @entity143 winger hazard @entity144 needs care - @entity5 7 ) @entity145 of @entity146 ? @entity147 and @entity148 are the teams to beat in @entity146 this season but @entity1 look the most capable of any side in the @entity152 of doing just that			1
this is arguably the best starting line - up and squad the @entity8 have ever had to combine a @entity134 title challenge with an assault on @entity146			2
they 're certainly the best - equipped @entity159 side to triumph in @entity146			0
8 ) @entity160 eleven years on and for all his mystery , @entity28 appears to still have all the same enthusiasm for his plaything as he did when he first bought the club from @entity165			0
remember him , anyone ? @entity5 gesticulates to his players during saturday 's win as @entity1 fans look on 9 ) home comforts @entity28 has been exploring options to expand or move from @entity10 over the past decade , but at least it has four stands and , well , works			1
those @entity8 who have been around longer than the @entity28 era will remember @entity10 with a dirt track around it , cars parked just yards from the pitch and a stand with no roof			0
here 's how @entity10 's terraced @entity10 looked in 1994 before being redeveloped 10 ) you 've never had it so good many a @entity1 fan will only know success			1
the last 10 years have been laden with it : three @entity134 titles , four @entity188 , two @entity189 , one @entity152 and one @entity190			1
but it was once all so different			0
@entity1 were relegated to the old @entity192 in 1988 , and until @entity28 bought the club , their highest @entity134 finish was third in 1999			1
time to shake off those @entity10 blues			0
there 's plenty to sing about after all .			0

@entity5 *slammed* @entity1 fans for being too quiet on saturday
@entity1 are unbeaten in the @entity134 and four points clear at top
