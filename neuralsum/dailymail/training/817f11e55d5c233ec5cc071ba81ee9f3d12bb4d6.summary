hospital patients are claiming they were left freezing on a cold dialysis ward for two weeks after a boiler broke down			1
pensioner @entity3 said he and fellow kidney patients had been forced to wrap up in hats and scarves to keep warm after suffering ' unacceptable ' temperatures in the @entity8 at @entity9 and @entity10			1
the 70 - year - old said up to 40 patients were encouraged to bring in extra duvets and blankets to ward against the cold , which dropped to @entity16 , and that staff were left shivering when they were told they could not wear extra layers			1
pensioner @entity3 was forced to wrap on the freezing ward while having dialysis at @entity9 and @entity10 because of a boiler breakdown mr @entity3 , a former council leader , was diagnosed with kidney failure four weeks ago and has dialysis treatment three times a week			1
he said : ' dialysis is not a pleasant experience and to endure the cold for four hours at a time in those conditions was uncomfortable to say the least			0
' some of the patients who come in for dialysis are quite frail and it was tortuous for them because it was freezing			2
visitors complained about it too			0
' the hospital claims the ward was kept at 22 degrees but that 's rubbish			2
my house is kept at that temperature so i know what it feels like and it was definitely much colder - more like 15 degrees			2
' my nose was cold and i even considered wearing a balaclava			0
some patients even brought in duvets			0
' i do n't blame the nurses , who were cold themselves and had to give out extra blankets and suggested we bring in our own fleeces			2
@entity52 , director of @entity9 and @entity54 's @entity53 , said the ward is now back to its usual temperature ' i felt awful for them , they started to wear cardigans but were told they could n't wear them , i think because of germs			1
' mr , @entity3 , a retired engineer and ex-leader of @entity65 , has now received an apology from the ward manager @entity67 this week			1
the hospital has confirmed the temperature is back to normal but bosses refused to accept the temperature had dropped lower than @entity72			2
@entity52 , director of the @entity54 's @entity53 , said : ' we are sorry that our patients in the @entity8 at @entity9 and @entity10 have been inconvenienced by one of the two heaters serving the unit becoming faulty			1
' renal patients require a higher room temperature whilst undergoing dialysis for four to five hours , three times a week			1
mr @entity3 has now received a letter of apology from after he complained dialysis patients were left to suffer ' freezing ' conditions although the hospital says the temperature did not drop below 20 degrees ' our staff have been helping our patients to keep warm during their dialysis with the help of additional blankets for a few days whilst alternative heating was arranged			1
' a second boiler has continued to be operational during this time maintaining a temperature of at least 22 degrees with the assistance of portable electric heaters , increasing the temperature of the underfloor heating and turning off of the cold airflow system			0
' @entity103 sounds an alarm if the temperature drops to 20 degrees or below , which has not happened during this time			0
we keep spare parts for all our critical equipment ; however parts for these boilers must be fitted by a specialist @entity112 registered engineer which has been the cause of this delay			0
' the ward is now back to its usual temperature			0
we have not received any formal complaint regarding this			0
' but mr @entity3 , who used to manufacture boilers , claimed the hospital did not have the necessary spares which was why patients had to suffer the cold conditions for two weeks			1
' that 's no way to run a hospital , ' he added			0
' the question now is will the hospital buy spares for the next time this happens ?			0
