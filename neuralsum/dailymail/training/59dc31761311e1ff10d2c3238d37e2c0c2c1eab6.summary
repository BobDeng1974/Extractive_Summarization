by @entity0 the @entity3 has started with a bang and we 've seen some sensational games but , make no mistake , every football fan in the country will already be looking forward to next season			2
last year ’s @entity9 was one of the most dramatic we ’ve ever seen and , with a new cast of characters , let ’s hope for more of the same			0
@entity14 arrives at @entity16 fresh from @entity18 ’s incredible destruction of world champions @entity20 — and the fixtures have thrown up the perfect start for the @entity23			1
he opens with the same opposition as @entity44 — @entity32 — but @entity24 wo n’t have to play a top - six team until @entity51 come to @entity38 in october			1
they are still a few good players away from being strong enough to get back to the very top , but with that run of games @entity16 could well be the early pacesetters			0
for the promoted sides it ’s a time of huge excitement			2
when are your great away days at @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity38 ? @entity65 ’s @entity64 , @entity66 at @entity67 and that up - and - coming young manager at @entity69 , will be looking forward to each and every game			1
experienced : @entity24 does not face a top six side until taking on @entity73 's @entity51 in october up we go : @entity75 ( left ) led @entity69 to victory in the @entity78 play - off final , while @entity66 ( right ) secured automatic promotion with @entity67 top tier : @entity64 led @entity65 back to the @entity9 for the first time in a decade @entity65 host @entity82 on day one and @entity69 will entertain @entity83 , but @entity67 will be absolutely delighted that they have @entity51 at home first up			1
it will be the @entity85 versus @entity73 , and what a game for @entity87 to get his side off and running and to get @entity89 bouncing			0
@entity90 could prove to be a new hero for @entity51 while @entity92 will join him in west @entity93 , but @entity95 fans will be in no mood for forgiveness when the sides meet			1
@entity99 will try to balance another title charge with @entity102 football , but @entity42 will not let the trophy go without a fight			2
the @entity9 is the best in the world			0
it ’s where every player , manager and fan wants to be			0
now we know who faces who and when			0
new boy : @entity92 will come up against his old club @entity95 with @entity51 next season second time lucky ? @entity117 ( right ) , @entity118 ( left ) and their @entity99 team - mates will be hoping to mount another title challenge after late disappointment last season			1

@entity24 will take over at @entity38 after the @entity3 with @entity18
the @entity23 has a good run of games to ease him into life in the @entity9
promoted sides @entity69 , @entity67 and @entity65 will relish every fixture
@entity51 new boy @entity92 will face his old side @entity95
@entity99 will hope to mount another title challenge
champions @entity42 are the team to beat
