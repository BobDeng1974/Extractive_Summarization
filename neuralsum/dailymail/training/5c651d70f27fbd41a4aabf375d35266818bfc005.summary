@entity0 champions @entity0 suffered a shock defeat to bottom of the table @entity4 , as the @entity6 side ended @entity8 's winning streak with a late goal from @entity10			2
the hosts , who are expected to unveil former @entity14 manager @entity13 as their new manager in the coming days , put in a much improved performance against the @entity18 finalists , and in the end ran out deserving winners			0
@entity21 was the star of the show , driving his side forward and scoring a magnificent curling effort after the hosts had fallen behind			0
@entity10 gets up above the @entity0 defence to score the winning goal at the @entity28 stadium @entity10 celebrates heading @entity4 into the lead in the 82nd minute against the champions @entity21 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity4 team - mates after scoring a superb equaliser @entity34 put @entity0 into the lead after tapping home @entity38 's inviting cross @entity4 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity10 , @entity45 , @entity21 , @entity46 , @entity47			1
subs : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 @entity0 : @entity56 ; @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ; @entity34 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ; @entity64 , @entity34			1
subs : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 referee : @entity74 and @entity0 were unable to hold on for a valuable point , in a game where they were often outplayed by a side with very different priorities in @entity0			0
@entity0 's task was made much harder by left back @entity60 , who picked up two bookings in the first five minutes after half time , both with unnecessary tackles , to leave his side in the lurch			1
and despite struggling to break down the ten men of @entity0 , @entity4 eventually earned the win , their first since august , when @entity10 headed home from close range			1
at the heart of almost everything good the home side created was @entity21			0
the former @entity92 forward committed defenders , played incisive passes , and was twice unlucky not to have been awarded a penalty , receiving instead a yellow card for diving and a bloodied mouth			0
@entity34 celebrates giving @entity0 the lead with @entity100 and @entity60 after just 10 minutes @entity39 could do nothing about the goal , as bottom of the table @entity4 endured a tough start @entity21 , who led the fightback brilliantly for the @entity6 side , is fouled by @entity108 and @entity62 still , neither the referee nor @entity34 's shoulder could deny him his goal , a spectacular curling strike from outside the box			1
it had all looked so different after just ten minutes , when @entity0 took the lead			2
@entity38 's cross from the edge of the box was the sort of delivery strikers can usually only dream of			0
@entity34 , arriving at the far post , had a tap in from inside six yards , as two sociedad defenders failed to cut out the inviting ball			0
@entity100 vies for the ball with @entity41 as @entity4 climbed out of the relegation zone @entity34 smashes his shoulder into the face of @entity21 , but it went unnoticed by the referee @entity21 was left with a mouth full of blood but picked himself back up to continue an excellent performance but @entity4 took just five minutes to hit back , and after @entity21 's strike they really should have gone into the interval ahead			1
first the @entity135 was denied a penalty when @entity59 appeared to have fouled him , before the @entity0 defender performed heroics to deny @entity10 , who had rounded the keeper but could n't beat @entity59 's goal - line slide			2
in the end , however , it would not matter			0
@entity60 's stupidity left his side exposed , and @entity10 was rewarded for a night of hard work when he headed past @entity56 with eight minutes to go			2
@entity38 loses out to @entity4 's @entity46 as the hosts put in their best performance of the season @entity8 is perplexed as @entity60 leaves the field after picking up two stupid yellow cards @entity34 can not believe that @entity0 are behind in a game they had looked like winning after 10 minutes			1

@entity34 *converts* @entity38 cross in 10th minute to make it 1 - 0
@entity21 curls in a beauty to equalise five minutes later
@entity0 reduced to ten men after @entity60 sent off on 49 mins
@entity161 heads home the winner with eight minutes left
@entity21 has a first half claim for a penalty turned down , and is booked for diving
