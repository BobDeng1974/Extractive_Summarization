striking images have revealed new insights into how the kidney develops from a group of cells into a complex organ			2
in a time - lapse video , a mouse kidney is seen developing , with cells growing out like the branches of a tree			1
it is hoped the images will help scientists to understand the early stages of development in mammals			0
@entity18 scientists took time - lapse kidney growth images			1
they reveal structures called nephrons branching out like a tree			1
these are instructed to do so by a key protein called beta - catenin			1
by altering the protein activity , the researchers found that they could instruct the kidney to grow differently researchers at the @entity18 's @entity30 used time - lapse imaging to capture mouse kidneys growing in the laboratory on camera			1
they identified a key protein called beta - catenin that instructs cells to form specialised structures within the kidney			1
these structures - called nephrons - are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood to generate urine			2
yesterday it was revealed that scientists had developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory			0
while the ‘ egg ’ itself was artificial , the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop			0
the method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way , rather than performing tests on laboratory animals			0
the embryo featured in the video did n't hatch to grow into an adult bird , but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work			0
yellow areas in the video show where beta - catenin is most active , with higher concentrations instructing cells to form particular parts of the structure			2
the images reveal that a gradient in the activity of beta - catenin forms along the growing nephron			1
it is the concentration of the molecule that instructs cells to form each particular part of the structure			0
by changing the activity of beta - catenin in different places , the researchers learned that they could instruct cells to form the kidney in different ways			1
if nephrons do not work correctly , it can lead to a wide range of health problems - from abnormal water and salt loss , to dangerously high blood pressure			0
the findings will help scientists to grow nephrons in the lab that can be used to study how kidneys function			1
these pictures shows two different views of nephrons growing in the laboratory			0
on the left , the green and red areas highlight cells that filter waste products from the blood ( shown in purple and red on the right			0
the blue / green section in both shows where urine is collected and taken away for excretion also , the use of time - lapsed imaging means that , rather than requiring different litters of mice to study different developmental stages , the same animals can be studied over time			2
this leads to a significant reduction in the number of animals needed for this type of research			0
' this is the first time we have been able to identify the molecular signals that instruct cells exactly how to form functional nephrons , ' said dr @entity136 , of the @entity18 's @entity30			2
' by using time lapse imaging , we can get detailed information about the signals that control how kidneys form at different time - points in development , ' dr @entity137 , of the @entity18 , added			1
' this means that we can use fewer animals and obtain much more information than normal imaging techniques			0

@entity18 scientists took time - lapse kidney growth images
they reveal structures called nephrons branching out like a tree
these are instructed to do so by a key protein called beta - catenin
by altering the protein activity , the researchers found that they could instruct the kidney to grow *slightly* differently
the findings could reveal more about how kidneys function
