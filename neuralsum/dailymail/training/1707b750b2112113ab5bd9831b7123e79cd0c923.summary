in the months after he was released by the @entity37 , psychiatrist dr @entity47 found the former doctor had also experienced a relapse into a chronic depressive illness			2

taking this into account , the @entity34 resentenced him to a minimum of three and a half years			1
@entity67 will remain on parole until his full sentence of five and a half years expires in may 2016			1
