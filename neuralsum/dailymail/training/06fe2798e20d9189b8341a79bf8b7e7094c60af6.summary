@entity0 is out of the @entity1 after crashing during the sprint for the line at the end of the opening stage in @entity6 yesterday			1
the @entity8 rider boarded the team bus to the start of stage two in @entity12 this morning but his team , @entity13 , have now confirmed the worst fears of cycling fans hoping to see him sprint to glory on @entity17 tomorrow after failure to do so at the @entity19 in 2012			2
@entity0 suffered ' ligament ruptures with an ac - joint dislocation ' between his collarbone and his shoulder after trying ' to find a gap that was n't there ' on @entity6 's @entity26			1
instead , the 29 - year - old tumbled after colliding with @entity71 @entity70			1
as it is , his tour ends in disaster after only one stage			0
the pain of his injuries means he is no longer able to continue			0
' i knew straight away because normally in crashes i bounce back straight away my shoulder was sticking out the way it should n't , ' @entity0 said on sunday morning			1
' this was the first time in my career that i knew something was up but i wanted to finish and i was able to do that but i was in pain			0
' i had some optimism that the swelling would go down overnight but it 's not possible from a medical point of view to start today			0
' i 'm absolutely devastated			0
firstly , the @entity1 is the @entity8 for anther two days and secondly we have an incredible team			2
' crossing the finish line : but @entity0 would n't have wanted it to end this way curse of @entity95 : the prime minister reacts to @entity0 's fall in @entity6 flashpoint : @entity0 and @entity70 come together as they sprint for the finish line down ... and out ? @entity0 shows all the signs of a man whose @entity1 dream could be over @entity0 also accepted responsibility for the crash , which came as he was pursuing a first yellow jersey of his distinguished career in his mother 's home town			1
' i spoke to @entity70 at the finish and then i called him at his hotel last night too			2
we both went for @entity115 's wheel but i wanted that gap so bad but it was n't there			0
' i hope that @entity70 is ok and today is a stage for him			2
he 's a good guy and i wish him well for the rest of the @entity1			1
' i would have loved to have been here for three weeks as we have a really strong team here but the crash was my fault			0
' it is the first time since 2008 - when he left prematurely to prepare for the @entity129 - that @entity0 will not complete the @entity1			1
the 2011 points classification winner and world champion won in @entity132 for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012			0
and his withdrawal means just three @entity8 remain in the race - defending champion @entity134 and @entity136 ( @entity137 ) , and @entity139 ( @entity138 )			0
