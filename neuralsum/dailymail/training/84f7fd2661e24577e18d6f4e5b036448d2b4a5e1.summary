by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 03:28 est , 14 march 2014 the charity says children will be more motivated to work if they have an encouraging start all children should start the school year with an a grade and should never be told they have failed , according to a controversial guide for teachers			1
pupils should be awarded the top grade automatically and told to work to maintain it , the influential @entity11 says			1
the charity claims teachers should harness the motivating power of ‘ loss aversion ’			2
all pupils should be given an a in a particular subject and must continuously improve to keep it			2
‘ consider having each pupil start with an a or a number of gold stars , with points or stars docked when appropriate , ’ the guide says			0
the researchers said the approach would not necessarily mean that students ended up with @entity32			0
the guidance includes the alternative idea of giving children grade targets to achieve , but instead of telling those who are struggling that they have an f grade – a ‘ fail ’ – encourage them with ‘ not yet ’ grades that show they can still reach their goal			1
the @entity11 , which was founded in 1754 and includes worldwide web inventor @entity44 and former archbishop of canterbury @entity45 as fellows , publishes an alternative curriculum that is followed by more than 200 schools , many of them state academies			1

they need to aspire to an a grade			0
they should n’t start at the finish line			0
’ mr @entity51 , a former prep school headmaster , added : ‘ children learn from failure			0
we all learn from failure			0
children have to be told they can fail and not be constantly praised			1
critics claim the move is deceptive and patronising to students who should be treated with honesty ‘ children want teachers to be honest and frank with them – it is only silly educationists who have these ideas about failure			1
’ further ideas in the guide include giving pupils views of nature or potted plants to reduce aggression			0
teachers are also urged to ‘ prime ’ pupils by asking them to write an ‘ a ’ on exam papers before they start writing to boost their performance			1
