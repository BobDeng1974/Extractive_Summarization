a @entity0 is under fire for a sexually explicit poster that was used in a sex - ed class			1
the poster hung up at @entity5 asks : ' how do people express their sexual feelings ? ' and then lists a series of sex acts ranging from anal and vaginal sex to saying ' i like you ' and cuddling on the couch			0
@entity15 told @entity16 that his 13 - year - old daughter was so shocked by the poster that she snapped a picture of it to show him			2
' who approved this ? ' he asked			0
' you know this had to pass through enough hands that someone should have said , " wait a minute , these are 13 - year - old kids , we do not need to be this in - depth with this sexual education type of program			0
" ' at first , @entity45 spokesman @entity44 defended the poster , saying it was in line with curriculum used across the country to promote abstinence			1
appalled : @entity52 parent @entity15 ( above ) was shocked to learn that the poster was n't a joke and was actually being used as part of the curriculum for his 13 - year - old daughter ' the item is meant to be part of a lesson , and so certainly as a standalone poster without the context of a teacher led discussion , i could see that there might be some cause for concern , ' she said			1
mr @entity15 complained that the curriculum needed to change or else he would pull his daughter from the school			2
' this has nothing to do with abstinence or sexual reproduction , ' he said			0
' i would like to see that this particular portion of the curriculum is removed from the school			1
' mr @entity15 was saved the trouble of having to transfer his daughter to another school when the poster was removed following a swift negative reaction			1
superintendent dr @entity85 says that even he finds the poster troubling			1
he says neither he or the school board approved the poster - it was something instituted by the curriculum department flip - flopping : at first , district spokesman @entity44 ( left ) defended the poster as part of their abstinence - based curriculum , but eventually superintendent dr @entity97 ( right ) took the poster down saying it was offensive even to him ' i find that language offensive , i really do and so when we ’re teaching human sexuality , again , there ’s a balance			1
what ’s appropriate at what age level ? what ’s not appropriate ? it`s a really difficult decision , ' dr. @entity85 said			2
at the same time , dr @entity85 says society has changed a lot and children know more about sex today than their parents may be aware of			1
@entity117 mother @entity116 agrees , and that 's why she signed a permission slip allowing her daughter @entity120 to take the sex - ed course			0
defenders : @entity117 mother @entity116 ( left ) wo n't take her daughter @entity120 ( middle ) out of the sex - ed class because of the poster daughter @entity120 is n't troubled by the poster because people her age are already sexually active and they ' do n't know the consequences '			2
' you can say all you want , that your children do n’t know these things , but they ’ve been knowing these things since maybe , the age of 10 , ' @entity120 said			0
mother @entity116 says she found the poster ' alarming ' but she 's not going to take her daughter out of the class			0
' i ’ve read through my daughter ’s @entity140 , seen her news feed and her friends on there			0
the things they ’ve posted , you ’d be astounded , ' she said .			0

the poster at @entity150 has since been banned following parental outrage
at first , the district defended the poster that was being used in their abstinence - based curriculum
but school superintendent dr @entity85 removed the poster because even he found the language offensive
