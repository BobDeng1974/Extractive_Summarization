by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 19 june 2012 thousands of family doctors will be paid despite striking on thursday			0
health trusts have decided not to dock salaries even though the @entity4 will refuse to treat almost all their patients			1
they claim that a day 's pay – £ 430 to a typical gp on £ 110,000 a year – is merited because urgent cases will still be dealt with			2
strike action : @entity11 members will go on strike over doctors receiving a £ 68,000 a year pension but a practice chief at one @entity17 trust said : ' it is effectively saying to doctors – " you take what action you like , we will still pay you "			1
' my colleagues and i are absolutely incensed			0
' around 1.25million appointments , tests and operations will be cancelled when @entity11 members take their industrial action over pensions			0
with at least 40 per cent of doctors expected to strike , the impact will be felt in hospitals as well as local surgeries			1
@entity33 , a @entity34 mp who is also a hospital doctor , said : ' a doctors primary duty is to look after patients , and yet a strike will see operations cancelled , and patients lives being potentially put at risk			1
' the public will be even more shocked to learn that doctors are still going to paid on the day that they strike			2
if they are going to strike on thursday , doctors should hand back their pay			1
around 1.25million appointments , tests and operations will be cancelled when the industrial action takes place ' the public will not understand why doctors are striking over receiving a pension of £ 68,000			1
this is the kind of generous pension that many hard working people in both the public and private sector can only ever dream of receiving			2
' employers generally have the right to withhold pay from strikers or reduce it when only limited duties are performed			0
but at least nine of the 50 primary care trusts in @entity62 have decided not to cut @entity4 ' pay – largely because of the difficulty of doing so			1
although surgeries are funded by trusts , gps are paid directly by the surgeries and are effectively self - employed			0
the position is different for hospital doctors , who are employees			0
in most cases , they will lose pay unless they can make up the lost working hours in their own time			0
none of the 25 organisations contacted by the @entity78 confirmed pay would be docked for family doctors			2
trusts not cutting pay include @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
secretary of state for health @entity94 has urged gps to consider opening their surgeries this saturday to help deal with the backlog of appointments @entity17 @entity101 said it was highly unlikely any pay would be deducted			1
its spokesman said trusts would find it too difficult to calculate any deductions			1
@entity107 , head of @entity108 , which advises health managers , said : ' the way doctors work can be complex and many will continue to treat emergency and urgent cases , so many organisations have put processes in place for pay as part of their contingency plans to ensure safe care on the day of action			1
' this will often involve a proportionate deduction recognising pay for partial performance on the day			0
' many staff will not be participating in the action and will be paid as normal			0
' mr @entity107 confirmed that doctors would not have pay docked if they managed to slot in clinics on friday morning , for example , when they may have otherwise have been doing paperwork			2
they would then have to do these administrative chores in their spare time			0
some hospitals , however , are planning to cut between 30 and 50 per cent of salaries for thursday for those that take part			1
other sites have decided to pay doctors nothing			2
last week @entity94 urged @entity4 to consider opening their surgeries this saturday to help deal with the backlog of appointments			0
in a letter to @entity149 , the @entity11 's chair of council , the health secretary pointed out that ' today 's routine appointments can become tomorrows emergencies '			0
responding to the letter , dr @entity149 insisted that patient safety would not be put in jeopardy			0
' tens of thousands of grassroots doctors feel so strongly that the changes to their pension scheme are unfair and unnecessary that they have decided to take industrial action – the first time in almost 40 years , ' he added			1
' this is why doctors will be in their usual workplaces and patient safety remains their top priority			0
' the @entity11 has not confirmed whether any gps are planning to work on saturday but insists any lost work will be made up at a later date it is highly unlikely that they will take mr @entity94 's advice however as most have not worked at weekends since 2004 when a contract negotiated by @entity171 enabled them to opt out			0
doctors say they already pay a far higher proportion of their salaries into their pensions than other @entity17 workers			1
a @entity11 spokesman said the decision whether to pay striking doctors lay with individual trusts .			2
