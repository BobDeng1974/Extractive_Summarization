@entity0 spend an astonishing £ 100 million a year on cough syrup – when a glass of honey and lemon could work just as well , according to a new @entity6 television investigation			1
it claims that branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using ‘ clever marketing ’ to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products , and that some manufacturers simply use the same pills in different packaging throughout their ranges			1
in @entity36 , to be broadcast on thursday , dr @entity21 , an infectious diseases specialist , warns we should think less about convenience and more about the effectiveness of medicines			1
there are three main types of over-the - counter cough remedies , those that contain suppressants to alleviate symptoms of a dry , tickly cough , syrups that reduce the urge to cough by coating the throat , and products that help to thin sticky mucus , making coughing easier			1
some also contain paracetamol or ibuprofen , both of which reduce a temperature , decongestants and antihistamines that can help sleep			1
yet an authoritative study from @entity63 ’s @entity62 claimed cough medicines work mostly through a placebo effect , and that just 15 per cent of the effect can be attributed to the medicines in them			1
@entity69 : sores on the inside of the mouth or cheeks can be caused by damage to the lining of the mouth from hot foods , biting your cheek or even rubbing dentures			1
they can also be a sign of an iron or @entity84 deficiency , so a balanced diet can help prevent them			1
spicy foods and chocolate can be triggers , so keep a food diary if you have recurrent outbreaks to pinpoint problem foods			1
it ’s also worth checking your toothpaste – formulas that contain a foaming agent called sodium lauryl sulphate can cause mouth ulcers by reducing the protective mucus layer in the mouth			1
you might consider switching brands			2
treat : over-the - counter antiseptic gels can bring relief from the stinging and help form a protective layer around the mouth ulcer to speed up healing			2
you could also try a medicated mouthwash containing chlorhexidine , which is anti-inflammatory and helps reduce bacteria			2
if you have had mouth ulcers for more than three weeks , go to your gp or dentist , who may prescribe steroids in the form of a tablet , mouth spray or gel			2
do n’t bother : some people believe upping their @entity124 intake will cure their mouth ulcers , as the vitamin is known to help the wound - healing process , but too much can actually irritate the mouth			2
stick to the daily recommended allowance of 40mg per day ( 30mg for children aged one to ten ) through a healthy diet			1
a study of 60 over-the - counter medicines found that all but two contained sweeteners such as honey or sucrose , which can stimulate saliva and mucus production			1
in the documentary , dr @entity21 shows how an old - fashioned remedy of honey and lemon could be just the tonic to banish a troublesome cough			1
he inhales pepper spray into his lungs , which makes him cough , then takes a lemon - and - honey concoction			1
he inhales the pepper spray once more , but does n’t cough at all			1
professor @entity151 of @entity152 , who also appears in the programme , admits there is no good scientific answer as to why the home - made cure is as effective but , with no potential side effects , the health benefits are obvious			2
the @entity160 of @entity161 ( @entity162 ) , a trade association representing manufacturers of over-the - counter medicines , says that although it is difficult to test the effectiveness of cough medicines , as the severity and duration of symptoms can vary , research has shown they are rated as effective by 90 per cent of consumers			1
the film also reveals that @entity0 families spend £ 350 million on a variety of painkillers , with packaging claiming to specifically target ailments such as period pain , headaches or muscular problems			1
for example , @entity183 and @entity184 both market forms of ibuprofen that are aimed specifically at those suffering from period pain , while @entity187 , which is a branded form of paracetamol , claims on the packet to treat tension headaches , period pains and toothache			2
but dr @entity21 says that once the medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream , there is no way to send it to a particular part of the body			2
he also reveals that different branded packets all have an identical product licence number , which means they look different but contain exactly the same pills			2
‘ it is n’t that the manufacturers are being untruthful , but it is clever marketing to tempt you to spend more money , ’ said dr @entity21			1
the investigation claims branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using ‘ clever marketing ’ to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products @entity162 chief executive @entity218 told this newspaper : ‘ people search for products to treat their specific symptoms , so different labelling and packaging help people navigate the range more easily			1
‘ there are different formulations and formats of over-the - counter medicines , which could mean a painkiller gets to work faster or provides pain relief for longer , even if it has the same active ingredient			2
‘ for example , migraine products work faster while back pain products tend to be longer - lasting			0
’ dr @entity21 says : ‘ some medicines are a waste of our hard - earned cash			0
products may be convenient but not necessarily effective			0
’ excess production of the skin pigment melanin can cause blotchy uneven patches of darker skin , known as hyperpigmentation or , more commonly , liver spots			0
although harmless , they can be unsightly , appearing most commonly on the backs of the hands			0
@entity250 damage is a common cause and pregnancy hormones can also trigger the condition			0
two recent pregnancies and many years as a sun - worshipper have left me with blotches of darker skin just above my upper lip , on my cheeks and under my eyes			0
in the winter i cover them with a foundation , but as summer approaches i ’d rather not have to cover up with lots of make up			0
where ’s the solution ? the @entity268 active 99.0 anti-ageing facial is on offer at their day spa at @entity271 in @entity272			0
what ’s the treatment ? the 75 - minute facial promises to firm , smooth and reduce the appearance of fine lines as well as helping to reduce the discoloration caused by hyperpigmentation			0
the therapist begins by cleansing my skin with an exfoliating powder cleanser			0
she then gets started with the microdermabrasion machine , which works like a mini-hoover to suck up the dead skin cells , and applies a glycolic peel which targets the hyperpigmentation by breaking apart the dead , damaged cells and peeling away the dark marks			0
after this she applies a serum , which contains kojic acid ( this helps to reduce the appearance of dark spots and discoloration and even out the skin tone ) and niacinamide , a form of @entity300 which can even out skin tone			0
she then uses a wand attached to a micro-current machine to deliver tiny electrical impulses which enhance the penetration of the active ingredients in the serum			0
the micro-currents also have an anti-ageing effect by increasing blood and lymph circulation and boosting the production of collagen and elastin			0
the therapist follows up by applying an eye cream to help diminish puffiness and dark circles			0
she then applies an intensive moisturiser which contains glycolic acid ( known to help fade the effects of hyperpigmentation ) , and finishes off by applying an @entity323 30 to the face – important as microdermabrasion can increase the skin ’s photosensitivity for two weeks			0
does it work ? my skin felt fresher and clearer and its tone was brighter and more even			0
this was the perfect preparation for scaling down my make up routine as the summer approaches			0
the blisslabs active 99.0 facial is £ 195			1
