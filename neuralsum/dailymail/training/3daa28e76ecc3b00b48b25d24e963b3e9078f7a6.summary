by @entity0 the return to tv after an absence of ten years of @entity4 — the most intelligent and challenging quiz show of its time , with a daily audience of four million viewers — takes my mind back to its beginnings			1
in 1986 , i had received the letter that was to change my life , although i was so busy at the time — producing @entity15 and making a new sitcom starring @entity17 from @entity18 — that i very nearly did n’t get round to opening it			2
it came from a chap called @entity22 , a former sales manager with @entity23 who said he had an idea for a new television quiz show			1
he called it twenty to one			2
legendary : @entity0 who presented and produced fifteen to one for 15 years it was a good idea , and knowing that it had already been rejected by nine other producers and sensing that @entity22 would probably be very keen to make any sort of positive progress , i made him an offer			1
i ’d pay him £ 200 if he gave me a 12 - month option to develop the idea			2
well , that £ 200 was the best money i ’ve ever spent in my life			0
for it led , of course , to fifteen to one , the hugely popular @entity44 quiz show that i presented and produced for 15 years			1
in all , we made 2,265 programmes , with almost 34,000 contestants endeavouring to answer an astonishing 350,000 questions			0
once , the show topped @entity44 ’s viewing figures every day for a week			1
originally running between january 4 , 1988 and december 19 , 2003 , each show began with 15 contestants and whittled them down to three finalists			1
to avoid elimination they had to not only answer questions correctly , but also decide which of their opponents to nominate to put under the question spotlight			0
the 15 highest - scoring winners from the series were then entered into a grand final to find the overall champion			0
arguably , the combination of tactical skills and general knowledge made the show unique and influenced successors such as @entity69			1
i ’m pleased — and rather flattered — that a decade or so after our last grand final , the show is back			1
naturally , it ’s a little odd seeing someone else presenting it , but i think @entity77 is a very good choice			0
she ’s funny , a good broadcaster but , most importantly of all , she ’s intelligent			0
i ’ve always thought that what made @entity4 the institution it became was its @entity83 was sheer happenstance that i got into quiz shows at all			1
@entity0 who presented @entity4 which topped @entity44 ¿ s viewing figures every day for a week by the mid-seventies i ’d carved out a pretty successful career as a producer / director of sitcoms and the occasional drama , too , having worked with @entity93 on @entity94 and @entity95 in @entity96 , made a series with @entity98 , and produced several episodes of @entity100 with @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
and then i got a call from @entity105 asking me to go the @entity106 and look at a show called @entity108 with a view to buying the format			1
i ended up producing the first three series of what in the @entity114 we called @entity115 , presented originally by @entity116			1
suddenly , i was a quiz show producer and , when @entity15 with @entity117 soon followed , a pretty successful one at that			1
which , i suppose , is why , several years later , @entity22 had got in touch with me			0
i began trialling his idea but , hard as i tried , i could never whittle down 20 contestants to one winner inside half an hour , which was vital if we wanted to get it commissioned			0
i realised it would work better if we reduced the starting line - up to 15			0
there would n’t be a lot of time for chat or banter but it could be done			0
i took the proposal to @entity44 , and they liked it enough to commission a proper studio pilot			1
@entity137 , i said , i ’ll present the pilot , as i understand how the show should work , and then if you like it we can discuss who we should get to present it full time			1
but when @entity44 gave the green light for the first series to be made , they said they wanted me to present it			1
in fact , they wanted to bring in someone else to produce the show , so that i could concentrate on presenting			2
welcome return : @entity77 was chosen to be the host of the new @entity4 which is back but i was n’t having that : by now fifteen to one felt like my baby			0
after a bit of thought , they gave me the go - ahead to do both jobs			0
fifteen to one soon became an established part of the tea - time television landscape			0
but its success was n’t down to me alone ; the real credit belonged to my wonderful production team and the superb team of question setters that i ’d assembled			0
that ’s what people liked about the show : the questions were properly tough and if you were playing along at home , you needed to have your wits about you			2
i did n’t set the questions but i did select them and i loved it when one of the setters delivered a particularly good one			0
one of my favourites was : ‘ who is the only person to have won a @entity185 prize and an @entity186 ? ’ got it yet ? the answer is @entity189 who won the @entity190 in 1925 and then won the @entity186 for @entity191 in 1938			0
i remember asking for ‘ more like that ’ after someone delivered that gem			0
that brilliant team , some of whom now set questions for @entity199 , did just that for show after show , year after year			2
indeed , they set such a high standard that the only quiz shows i watch regularly now are mastermind and @entity205			2
even now , a decade after our final show was broadcast and 14 years after i sold the format to @entity209 , i still take that wonderful team of people out for lunch at @entity213			1
@entity22 quite rightly became an important member of the team — he received a royalty for every show , became a quiz consultant and wrote tie - in books			1
people do n’t believe me when i tell them i do n’t watch today ’s quiz shows , but it ’s true ; i do n’t			2
i never saw @entity69 , while @entity223 just was n’t my kind of show			2
these days , people keep asking me what i think of @entity228 , but i have n’t seen it			0
i ’ll leave it to others to say what influence @entity4 had on those quizzes that followed it			0
we were intelligent , challenging and popular and if people think we raised the bar a little , that ’s good enough for me			0
fifteen to one is on @entity44 weekdays at 4.30pm			1
