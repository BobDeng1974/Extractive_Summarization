' he 's not here today but he 's in everyone 's thought , @entity18 , he 's a total bad a * * *			1
' the amazing thing about @entity18 – and i do n't think anybody out there will be surprised – is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors , ' producer @entity21 said			1

he was joined by @entity109 at the end of the trailer and is heard saying , ' @entity109 , we 're home			1
' the trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet @entity194			2
as a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed @entity197 and a skeletal x-wing , which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago			2
we then see an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of @entity204 , melted and disfigured from the sith lord 's funeral pyre at the end of @entity208			2
a hint of the old era : a skull of @entity204 - aka @entity204 - is shown in the beginning of the clip we hear @entity11 's voice reprising a line from the 1983 film : the force is strong in my family			1
he then appears to hand a lightsaber to another unseen character - a strong suggestion @entity12 has had a child			1
@entity73 , @entity168 and @entity72 are then all introduced in the clip and it is hinted that they are in allegiance			2
@entity18 appears with @entity109 only at the very end			1
the menace is always there : stormtroopers are also seen in the trailer , and they are located in a snowy location where is this ? : in the opening scene , a desert planet is shown that is not @entity245 , but rather a new place @entity34 said was @entity194 - it is not known how that is spelled or what lives there @entity249 is a multi-day festival produced by @entity251 that 's dedicated to @entity2 past and present			1

' he did not explain how @entity194 was spelled or where it was			0
in november the first trailer came out and it lasted only 88 seconds			2
opening some 30 - years after @entity208 , the teaser kicked off with @entity298 actor @entity72 , playing @entity299 , racing across a desert landscape dressed in full @entity285 regalia			2
a parched , disembodied voice tells us of an ' awakening ' and reminds us of the dual energies that are ' the dark side ... and the light			0
' the droids showed up too : also on stage were the new robot @entity310 ( left ) and the old robot @entity148 ( right ) , which looked a bit banged up behind the scenes : not only was the trailer shared , but so were shots from the making of the movie @entity298 actress @entity318 is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town , while @entity322 is seen as a fighter pilot , looking rather like a young @entity12 when he 's headed for the @entity324			1
the first trailer also delivered what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film 's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of @entity331 that blighted parts one , two and three of the science fiction saga			2
it also confirmed the welcome return of the iconic @entity337 , and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence			0
a new lightsaber made its debut , complete with a sword - like hilt , as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark , snow - layered forest setting			0
the film opens december 18 , 2015			0
the man with a plan : @entity34 spoke about the exciting project on stage the veterans : @entity11 , @entity8 and @entity174 waved to the crowd of loyal followers dark side : several @entity285 attended the event as they walked in a uniform line while standing in the background at the event the gang 's all here : several @entity2 diehards posed for snaps together while dressed in their costumes			1
