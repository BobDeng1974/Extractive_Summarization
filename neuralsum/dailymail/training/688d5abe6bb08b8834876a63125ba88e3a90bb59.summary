by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 14:35 est , 29 january 2013 a millionaire businessman has been ordered to remove an @entity4 message from the side of his luxury house because council chiefs say it is advertising , it emerged today			1
@entity9 , 54 , fell out with planners over the wording , taken from the @entity13 creed , which reads : ' there is no god but @entity16 , and @entity17 is his messenger '			1
known as shahada , the message declares the belief in the oneness of @entity22 and acceptance of @entity17 as his prophet			1
the inscription , in 2ft - high green lettering , has been placed across a first - floor archway on his large detached house in a residential street			1
' breaches planning laws ' : millionaire businessman @entity9 faces a court battle over this @entity4 slogan on his house in @entity35 , @entity36 , after the council ordered it be removed because it is ' advertising ' but he is now in a legal battle with planning chiefs , who classed it as the same as an advertising hoarding like a @entity43 's or @entity45 banner			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the message is simply there to bless the house			1
the symbols are not an advertisement in any sense of the word 's use in daily life			2
' i chose the sign 's green colour to reflect the ambiance of the property 's character and its surroundings			2
' mr @entity9 had the sign placed onto the side of his Â£ 750,000 eight - bedroom home in @entity35 , @entity36			1
but the city 's council later decided he did n't have the right planning permission to display the message across the home 's stone archway			1
the sign , which is around two metres wide and 60cm high , includes the declaration of the @entity4 faith , called the @entity4 creed			2
' @entity74 ' : the message , in 2ft - high lettering , is written across a first - floor archway on the large detached house the message on the side of @entity9 's house comes from the @entity4 creed , known as shahada , which declares the belief in the oneness of @entity22 and acceptance of @entity17 as his prophet			1
in @entity89 , this translates as : ' there is no god but @entity22 , @entity17 is the messenger of @entity22 ' a single , honest recitation of the shahadah in @entity13 is all that is required for a person to become a @entity95			1
this declaration , or statement of faith , is called the kalimah			0
in some sects in @entity102 , the creed is expanded with the addition of a phrase concerning @entity9 at the end to say : ' and @entity9 is the wali ( friend ) of @entity22 '			1
taking this creed is one of the five pillars of @entity102			0
the complete shahadah can not be found in the @entity112 , but comes from hadiths , sayings or or tacit approvals ascribed either validly or invalidly to the @entity4 prophet @entity17			1
business consultant mr @entity9 has also applied for permission to illuminate the sign in low voltage lighting			2
a family member , who did not wish to be named , added : ' it 's our home and we should be free to do whatever we want			2
' we 're suppose to have freedom of speech in this country and be allowed to express our faith however we please			2
' we do n't intend to cause any kind of offence but i do n't see how it is any different to having a @entity132 's flag hanging outside your home			0
' mr @entity9 applied for retrospective permission , but it was turned down			2
@entity137 have argued that the sign is an obtrusive ' advertisement ' according to planning regulations			0
under these guidelines , an advertisement includes any word , letter , model , sign , placard , board or notice used for advertising , making an announcement or direction			0
a council statement read : ' the property is domestic property and is not a mosque where such signs might be expected			0
' the sign consists of letters and words that announce religious faith and so can be considered to be an advertisement and express planning consent is required			0
' the advertisement is prominently sited upon the host building and is also prominent			0
its size and position on the building make it obtrusive			0
' legal fight : a court will now have to decide whether the message should be classed as an advertising hoarding like a @entity174 ( above ) a refusal of advertising consent will now be subject to a public hearing in @entity178 on february 15 after mr @entity9 appealed the decision			1
the sign has divided opinion among mr @entity9 's neighbours on the quiet suburban road			1
@entity184 , 78 , who lives opposite , said : ' maybe it 's ok for a mosque , but i do n't think it 's a suitable for a house			2
' it 's not the sort of thing you should be allowed to have on the side of your property			0
' it 's an eyesore , i do n't want to have to look out of my front window and see that every morning			0
but @entity199 , 25 , said : ' i do n't mind it at all			0
i think he should be free to express his religious preference			0
' the sign is very tastefully done , the green lettering looks good against the stonework			0
i think it adds a bit of colour to the street and i 'm not sure what the problem is			0

message reads : ' there is no god but @entity16 , and @entity17 is his messenger '
planners claim the 2ft - high lettering is like @entity43 's advertising hoarding
@entity9 , 54 , is now facing a legal battle in ' freedom of speech ' row
he said : ' the message is simply there to bless the house . it is not an advert '
