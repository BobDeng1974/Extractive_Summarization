by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 16 november 2013 @entity1 is to relax its controversial one - child policy because of concerns over slowing economic growth			1
couples will be allowed to have two children if one parent is an only child , the state news agency @entity5 reported			2
the policy was introduced in the late 1970s to control the huge population , now the world ’s largest at 1.4billion			2
some cities allow a second child if both parents are only children , and rural families can also try for a second if their first born is a girl			0
couples who flout the rules face hefty fines , seizure of their property and loss of their jobs			0
long - term : @entity1 's one - child policy has been in place for decades but many well - off families in the booming cities are willing to pay fines and the authorities have been known to turn a blind eye			1
although the deeply unpopular law - often brutally enforced through forced abortions - was effective at slowing an unsustainable birth rate , it has led to a shortage of working - age people who can care for and fund the ageing population			1
communist leaders fear this imbalance could spark widespread social unrest and threaten the party ’s 64 - year grip on power			0
the policy sparked a rise in infanticide of baby girls and illegal abortions of female foetuses because @entity1 families want male heirs			1
it has also led to a huge gender imbalance with far more men than women			0
strict : @entity1 's one - child policy currently limits most urban couples to one child @entity5 reported : ‘ the birth policy will be adjusted and improved step by step to promote long - term balanced development of the population in @entity1			1
’ professor @entity65 , from the @entity66 at @entity67 , said : ‘ this move is primarily to deal with the demographic deficit , which has huge economic implications , particularly over growth and stability			0
’ other major reforms announced by @entity1 include abolishing labour camps to ‘ improve human rights and judicial practices ’			2
it is largely for petty offenders , but corrupt officials who want to punish whistleblowers and those who try to complain about them to higher authorities abuse the system .			0

the @entity1 government says the one - child policy eased *poverty*
however , the strict measures led to abortions and *sterilisations*
