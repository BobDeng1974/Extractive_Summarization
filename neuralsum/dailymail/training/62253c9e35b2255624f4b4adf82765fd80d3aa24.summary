a woman has been sensationally arrested in @entity1 over the death of her five - year - old son on what would have been his 29th birthday			1
@entity6 went missing at a carnival at @entity8 in @entity9 in may of 1991 , sparking a nationwide search			1
his partial remains were discovered in april the following year at @entity12 , an industrial site at @entity14 , @entity9			1
according to reports at the time , @entity16 , 47 , took her son to a carnival in 1991 and allowed her son to ride on some of the attractions			1

the carnival was closed down while a frantic search took place , but he could not be found			2
in the days that followed his desperate relatives and family friends organised several searches in the @entity44 area			0
as the appeal for information intensified , thousands of rail workers were handed flyers while his face was shown on big screens at major sporting fixtures			0
but police became suspicious after no one at the carnival saw a youngster matching @entity6 's description			1
more than two decades later , a grand jury in @entity58 has indicted her on a first - degree murder charge			2
@entity16 was arrested wednesday evening around 6 p.m in @entity23 , @entity1 after leaving work at the law firm , according to master sgt. @entity63 , a @entity64 police spokesman			1
@entity16 was in her car and headed over to her sister 's house in @entity23 when she was pulled over and detained			1
' she was arrested without incident , ' @entity63 said			2
' she did n't put up a struggle			0
' a @entity9 prosecutor said in a statement that the new information that led to her arrest arose out of a cold case review of the boy 's unsolved 1991 disappearance			1
' following a routine , cold case review of the evidence and facts surrounding the disappearance and murder of @entity6 , a new investigation was conducted and the matter was presented to the grand jury , ' @entity58 prosecutor @entity77 said in a statement released thursday			1
the grand jury charged that @entity16 “ did purposely or knowingly kill @entity6 , or did purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily injury upon @entity6 , resulting in his death … , ' according to @entity77			1
@entity63 said that @entity64 police have been assisting @entity9 prosecutors on the case since at least 2012 - sitting in on witness interviews , executing search warrants and navigating the local court system , but declined to divulge further details			1
@entity16 , who lives with two other sons , 12 and 16 , in @entity64 , ' had n't been on our radar until a couple years ago , when we were contacted by @entity9 [ prosecutors ] , ' @entity63 said			1
' i checked our [ @entity101 ] jail records and we are not coming up with anything for her in this county , ' he said			0
her bail was set at $ 2million though and it is not yet clear whether she will waive an extradition hearing and return to @entity9			2
fellow employees at a civil litigation firm where @entity16 works were ' stunned ' to learn of her arrest			1
' everybody here was certainly surprised , stunned and saddened , ' said an employee of @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 & @entity117 , @entity118 , who requested anonymity in return for speaking freely			0
' the shocking thing is that her two sons are just these amazing , lovely children			0
she was a proud , doting mom to them , ' the source said , adding that the two boys had occasionally visited their mother at work			2
' who would have ever known ... ' the source said , before going silent for a moment			0
' the firm handles civil litigation , including medical malpractice , personal injury and wrongful death cases			0
' we had no knowledge of any of this , ' the source told @entity142 on thursday morning			0
' she came to work every day , but we had really no knowledge of any other - certainly of this particular incident - but in any other incidents that she was involved in			2
' police arrested @entity16 at an address in @entity23 , @entity1 , following a routine review of the cold case involving the death of her son a grand jury in @entity58 has indicted @entity16 on a first - degree murder charge the colleague said @entity16 never made mention of her missing son , or her 1995 guilty plea after claiming the previous year that she herself was abducted by @entity160 agents			1
@entity16 also pled guilty in 1998 to stealing a former employer 's computer			1
' she does have two kids , i know , in @entity64 , ' the colleague said , but @entity16 divulged very little at work about her personal life			2
@entity168 , spokeswoman for the law firm , said @entity16 has long been a member of the @entity170 , @entity1 legal community , and has worked for at least three other area law firms since the mid- 1990s			2
retired @entity9 judge @entity173 , who was @entity174 in 1991 , said the disappearance was a heartbreaking unsolved case that has been ' bugging ' him for years			1
' it ’s gratifying to know that you ’re suspicions were warranted in cases like this , ' he said on thursday			0
' you grow a tough skin in law enforcement work , and i ’ve been doing it for a lot of years , not only as prosecutor but a criminal judge			0
' but when you have a young child with a face like @entity190 , ' he said , sighing deeply , ' you can never forget it			0
' @entity173 said that despite suspicions , investigators could not nail down sufficient evidence for an arrest back in 1991			2
' there were several factors that more than satisfied us that we were looking at the right suspect , ' @entity173 said			0
' her inconsistencies [ in her story ] , some of the actual observations that were made [ by investigators ] , some of her associations and the fact that some of the associates would n’t talk to us – all made us confident we were moving in the right direction			0
' ' acknowledging the presumption of innocence and the state ’s burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt , it ’s a step in the right direction			0
i ’m pleased that this case was n’t put in a back shelf to gather dust			0
' he declined to speculate on what evidence may have prompted @entity16 ’s arrest			1
anyone with information is asked to call the @entity229 at ( 732 ) 745 - 2957 or leave an email at @entity231			0
