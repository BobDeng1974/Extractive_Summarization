smartphone - smashed to pieces			0
even his underpants have been banished , not to mention his beloved @entity8 collection			0
they are just some of the mod cons and home comforts that @entity12 has dispensed with in his attempt to become 100 per cent @entity14 , right down to the coffee he drinks and the films he watches			1
proving a point : @entity14 journalist @entity12 poses with some of the items he has bought after setting himself a challenge to use only @entity14 - made products the 26 - year - old journalist , who lives in @entity23 , embarked on the challenge in response to comments made by @entity14 's minister for economic renewal @entity26 who urged the country to buy @entity14 to boost home - grown industry			1
but he was shocked to discover that barely 5 per cent of his belongings had been made in @entity14			1
he set himself a monthly budget of â ‚ ¬ 1,800 ( Â £ 1,500 ) and even took out a bank loan to buy in all his new products , it was reported by @entity37			1
out went pretty much everything , from the @entity41 - grown green beans and the light bulbs from @entity43 to his @entity45 - made underpants and his @entity47 which he smashed with a @entity49 saucepan			0
patriotic purge : mr @entity12 had to get rid of his beloved music collection by @entity52 musician @entity8 ( left ) and also his @entity53 - made @entity47 which he smashed with a @entity14 - built @entity49 saucepan for his experiment as did the refrigerator , which meant he had to chill his food on a window ledge , and even his @entity60 music because , although they are @entity14 they sing in @entity52			1
he was , however , spared having to sling out his girlfriend @entity63 and pet cat @entity65 , who are thankfully both @entity14			2
after ten months , he had very nearly succeeded , save for a mere 3.1 per cent of @entity67 products that an ' auditor ' ruled he still had in his possession - six @entity70 forks , a @entity43 guitar and some unsourced wall paint			2
strict : mr @entity12 even banned @entity60 music because although they are @entity14 they sing in @entity52 mr @entity12 said his experiment was n't designed to be patriotic , but rather to hold politicians to account for the comments they make			1
he said : ' this was n't about @entity14 nationalism			2
it was trying to show that we should think about the way we consume and make different choices			0
' if we want to save jobs and industries wherever we are , we might think about supporting them			0
