it was the game banned in a sixth of @entity3 playgrounds - but one school has bucked the trend by encouraging pupils to collect as many conkers as possible			1
and some 400 pupils at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , took part in the unusual harvest collection - bringing in a staggering 50,000 conkers over a ten - day period			1
