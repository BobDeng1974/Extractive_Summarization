it has proved somewhat of a mixed week for trainer @entity1 with some success and a few near misses , but peace and @entity5 has looked a class act since joining the @entity9 maestro and is taken to land the @entity10			1
@entity1 , who had his first winner of the @entity6 when call the cops won the @entity13 , has a strong hand in the opener with @entity16 and the classy @entity17 providing terrific back - up artillery for his main gun			1
they should both run huge races , with the latter especially dangerous given the way he travels and jumps			0
however , @entity25 looked to have an extra gear in reserve on his @entity29 debut at @entity31 and i have rarely seen a juvenile hurdle with such enthusiasm and precision			2
@entity36 looks a solid bet to land the @entity10 @entity10 @entity1 also has @entity38 and the classy @entity17 running in the opener everything went wrong for the son of @entity42 on trials day as a small field and sluggish pace led to him pulling hard and over-racing early on , but he still possessed the quality to score readily and the likelihood of a stronger gallop is sure to suit today			1
the @entity50 trio of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 all look to have viable credentials with preference for the latter , who was a smooth winner of the @entity58 at @entity59 , one of the chief trials for his race			0
@entity63 ( @entity6 , 4.40 ) is another @entity65 import who arrived on these shores with a big reputation and , although he has been a slower burner than most , he could be ready to strike			1
@entity69 has been highly competitive in the week ’s hurdle events and his five - year - old shaped with plenty of promise in an @entity75 handicap on his latest start when staying on nicely late on behind @entity77			0
some will think he has plenty of weight , but his handler looks to have found a race where exciting conditional @entity82 can be utilised fully , and @entity69 won this event two years ago with @entity84 before @entity85 was third last year			0
@entity69 stands alongside sir @entity86 and the trainer can look for more success @entity89 is pictured at @entity90 in @entity91 the progressive @entity92 , winner of a @entity94 at @entity95 last time , looks dangerously well treated and rates as the chief danger , while course winner @entity98 could be overpriced , given his stable switch and change of headgear			2
@entity103 pulled a rabbit from the hat with @entity107 ’s 16 - 1 mount @entity106 in the @entity108 and @entity109 ( @entity6 , nap , 5.15 ) looks a sporting bet to land the finale			1
like @entity106 , @entity103 reaches for the first - time headgear for his seven - year - old , who was progressing nicely over fences until he stepped up in trip for a @entity118 last time and found it all too much			0
his previous efforts , including behind @entity121 in a @entity123 novice chase , read pretty well and he won with plenty in hand at @entity126 on his penultimate start , a victory which qualifies the selection for a bonus if he can complete the double today			2
@entity132 is sure to have plenty of supporters behind his rider and he should again run well given he was only beaten a length in the race last year , while it would be no surprise to see a resurgent @entity139 , fourth 12 months ago , also acquit himself well .			0
