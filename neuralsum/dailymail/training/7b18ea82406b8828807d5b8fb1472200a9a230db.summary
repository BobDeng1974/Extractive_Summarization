by @entity0 an enraged golfer has been caught on camera breaking all of his golf clubs in a post-game tantrum			1
the unnamed man was filmed following a round at @entity7 , @entity8 by fellow golfer @entity9 , who then shared the video to @entity11 and @entity12			1
in the footage , the man works through his clubs one - by - one , snapping them across his leg , throwing them to the ground and even using his head to bend their shafts			1
and once he 's done with the clubs , he moves on to his bags , which he throws to the ground and kicks - all while using a fair few foul words			1
' that 's about the end of that , ' he yells after destroying one club , before spying another one and adding : ' hold on , i kind of like this one			2
' he spares a few other items			0
' i just got this towel , ' he can be heard saying			0
' i 'm keeping this motherf * * * * *			0
' during his rant , other players can be heard laughing , which only serves to encourage him			0
no stopping him : he smashes his clubs against the ground and even bends one against his head , right think he 'll be invited back ? finally , he takes his anger out on his golf bag , throwing it to the ground at one point , a course marshal approaches him ' probably asking the guy to act like a rational human being , ' said @entity64 , which first shared the video			1
@entity9 , a basketball coach from @entity66 , shared the video to his @entity11 page , quipping : ' the funniest golf video ever			2
' but not all viewers shared the same opinion			0
' these guys are an embarrassment to the sport of golf , ' one @entity12 viewer wrote			2
' this is supposed to be a gentleman 's game , not a game of thuggery			0

the man was filmed destroying his clubs and bag outside a @entity8 clubhouse apparently after a particularly bad *day* on the golf course
