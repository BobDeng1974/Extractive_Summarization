@entity0 is confident his @entity2 side will not be caught cold on monday night when they play @entity3 at @entity4 just days after returning from warm weather training in @entity6			1
the @entity8 boss took his squad to balmy climes for a change of scenery as temperatures plunged last week			1
returning to the cold to face the @entity16 side in the @entity18 fourth round may come as a shock to their system , but @entity0 is unconcerned			1

' hopefully , the surface will be ok			2
we know we 've got to go there , face the conditions and get on with it			0
it wo n't faze us			0
we will take the challenge on and make sure we get the job done			0
' @entity0 explained : ' the training ground here is a little bit wet under foot at the moment and that obviously was n't the case away , so we got some good work done , ' he said			0
' we 've had two days leading into the game on monday , so the structure of the week works for us			0
' the break has done us good			2
we 've just come through @entity52 , which takes its toll on everybody			0
@entity2 will be hoping to avoid a fourth round @entity18 upset when they take on @entity16 outfit @entity3 ' it 's key they are able to re-boot for the challenges ahead			1
' the @entity59 is preparing for @entity3 in the same way he would a @entity62 match and insists the cup is important to his side			1
' even against @entity66 in the last round we had something like 10 internationals on the field of play , ' he said			2
' it 's a trophy we have a good opportunity to win			0
but you need a bit of luck in terms of opposition , and in games because sometimes it can hit somebody on the backside and you lose			0
