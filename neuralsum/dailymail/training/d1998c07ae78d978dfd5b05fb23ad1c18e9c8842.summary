' mr @entity22 said : ' as the car was rolling i honestly thought i had killed us			1
my wife was very calm and collected			0
she knew to brace herself and she was telling me to keep calm and not worry about it ' after checking his wife was ok , mr @entity22 managed to haul himself out of the battered car window before clambering back up to the road , while also trying to call for an ambulance and the police			1
