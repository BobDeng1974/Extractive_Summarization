by @entity0 loved and loathed : @entity1 , @entity2 's new premier twelve years ago , a train containing @entity5 activists heading for a protest at the site of a demolished mosque was set on fire in a small town in the @entity2 state of @entity12			1
the attack at @entity14 killed 59 passengers , sparking vicious retribution against local @entity17			1
mobs went on the rampage , raping hundreds of women and burning children after pouring kerosene down their throats			0
men were forced to watch their families tortured to death , then they too were slaughtered			0
about 2,000 people died and 200,000 made homeless over three nightmarish days			0
despite pleas for protection , @entity17 were ignored by officials			1
as the blood flowed , the state ’s newly - elected chief minister quoted @entity34 when he was asked about the carnage : ‘ every action has an equal and opposite reaction			1
’ no one was ever held accountable			0
but many @entity17 , including the @entity40 relatives of victims , believe that chief minister has blood on his hands for inciting the savagery			1
now this same man – banned from entering the @entity47 and shunned by @entity40 diplomats – has been elected @entity2 ’s new prime minister after a landslide election victory			1
@entity1 stormed to power yesterday , with results revealing the pro-business @entity5 nationalist trounced the ruling @entity55 dynasty			1
after a six - week election involving 500million voters , @entity1 ’s opposition @entity56 took more than six times the seats of its closest rival			1
it was the most decisive mandate since the 1984 assassination of prime minister @entity63 propelled her son to office			0
it immediately led to a stock market rally and raucous celebrations among @entity1 ’s supporters			2
his rise is a remarkable story : the tea boy from a lowly caste who rose to lead the world ’s biggest democracy			0
the celibate , yoga - loving technocrat , 63 , has been swept into power by an electorate fed up with a stuttering economy , stifling corruption and state sclerosis			1
victory : @entity56 ( @entity56 ) supporters dance to celebrate @entity1 's win hardline @entity5 : @entity1 takes blessings from his mother @entity86 , 90 although his election success was anticipated , the scale of victory was a shock			1
unlike recent @entity2 governments , the @entity56 will not be constrained by coalition – marking what his spokesman called a ‘ tectonic shift ’			2
for once , this was not election hyperbole			0
after @entity2 ’s most crushing triumph for three decades , @entity1 ’s first comment was on @entity99			1
good times ahead , ’ he told his four million followers , before visiting his 90 - year - old mother to celebrate			1
but given his history , there are fears this hardline @entity5 nationalist will inflame tensions with @entity2 ’s 180million @entity17 minority and its neighbour , @entity110			1
the two have had four wars since the 1947 partition of @entity2 – and both have nuclear arms			2
@entity1 , now 63 , pictured as a young boy ‘ this could go either way , ’ said one @entity17 diplomatic source			1
‘ it could be a terrible result for the region – but equally , sometimes these extreme politicians become more pragmatic when forced to grapple with the realities of power			0
’ @entity126 , head of the @entity127 that dominated politics since independence , once called @entity1 ‘ a merchant of death ’			2
but to his fans , he is @entity2 ’s saviour after the stumbling rule of @entity127 ’s @entity134 , a mild - mannered @entity135 economist			1
@entity134 last night looked set to win less than 50 of the 543 parliamentary seats at stake , a humiliation for the force that has dominated @entity2 politics in the 67 years since independence			1
claims that @entity1 would re-open communal wounds clearly failed to convince voters			2
born to a family of grocers , @entity1 spent his childhood helping at his father ’s rail station tea stall – a striking contrast to the privileged lifestyle of the @entity55 dynasty			2
he is understood to have been forced into marriage at 13 to @entity154 , now a shy , retired teacher			0
but his growing fascination with militant @entity157 made him determined to live as a bachelor			0
in his teens he joined a banned extreme sect called @entity161 , which promoted ascetic living , charity work and military - style discipline			0
it was reportedly inspired by fascist movements in @entity168			0
@entity1 greats crowds at the rally in @entity171 , in the western @entity2 state of @entity12 @entity1 salutes to the crowds at an @entity174 yet combined with skilful pr and self - promotion , he has built a power base that put him in charge of his western state for 13 years and now at the helm of his huge nation			1
@entity1 , who rises at 5am each day for an hour of yoga , turned his arid state into @entity2 ’s most business - friendly region			1
by building roads he was rewarded with rapid economic growth , boosting his image as an efficient administrator who focuses on hard work and eschews the flashy trappings of success			0
he is fascinated by the rapid success of @entity193 , and his election campaign promoted an alluring vision of @entity2 freed of corruption and filled with bullet trains			2
a technology lover , he appearing at rallies as a hologram			0
critics say @entity12 has fared no better than other states , while making little progress on @entity2 ’s grinding social problems			0
election officials count votes at a polling station in @entity208 as opposition leader @entity1 swept to power in a landslide victory , according to preliminary results an election official counts votes in @entity214			2
if the results are finalised as expected , it would be the first time a single party has won an outright majority since 1984 muslims , worse off than @entity5 on most measures from health to poverty , complain of discrimination			0
@entity2 has elected as prime minister its most divisive political figure , loved and loathed in equal measures			2
the hope is that this controversial character can shake off the stains on his reputation and drag his country into the shining future it deserves			0
yet the fear for many is that he may send his nation spiralling back into the darkest days of its past .			0

@entity1 stormed to power yesterday and is @entity2 's new premier
but he is linked to a train attack at @entity14 twelve years ago
@entity5 activists aboard train killed - sparking retribution against @entity17
plea for protection by @entity17 ignored and chief minister blamed by many
that chief minister happens to be 63 - year - old @entity256
fears his leadership will inflame tensions with 180million @entity17 minority
