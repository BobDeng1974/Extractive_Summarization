serial killer : @entity1 murdered between 215 and 260 of his patients using the drug @entity3 over a period of 20 years human remains from some of serial killer @entity1 ’s victims were kept for more than a decade by police before they were secretly destroyed without the families ’ permission , it has emerged			1
the samples were taken from 12 women to establish cause of death , police said			1
they were kept in storage for a number of years to ensure that police had the appropriate evidence should the murderer or his family appeal against his conviction			0
but in 2011 police decided to ' respectfully dispose ' of the tissue samples without telling the families			1
the remains were taken to an incinerator and burned on february 16 , that year , without ceremony			1
police only told the victims ' families what they had done recently when they realised a local newspaper reporter had found out about it			1
@entity31 chief constable sir @entity37 said officers ' agonised ' over whether or not to tell the families but decided not to , to save them reliving ' upset and distress '			2
the remains belonged to @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
their bodies were exhumed during the @entity1 investigation in the late 1990s			1
sir @entity37 said : ' this was not a decision that we took lightly , in fact it was a decision that we agonised over for a number of months with a number of independent advisory groups , partner agencies and other professionals			0
victims : the remains which were incinerated belonged to ( clockwise from top left ) @entity70 , 65 , @entity49 , 59 , @entity71 , 81 , @entity45 , 49 , @entity43 , 73 , and @entity42 , 81 victims : the other six people the remains belonged to were ( clockwise from top left ) @entity48 , 67 , @entity75 , 77 , @entity44 , 73 , @entity76 , 68 , @entity77 , 81 , and @entity78 , 57 ' i would hope that the public would understand that this was a very difficult decision for us to make but i want to assure people that we made this decision for the right reasons			2
' it was never our intention to cause the families any pain or distress			0
these families had not only experienced the upset of losing a family member but had had to relive it in the glare of the media and the public time and time again - that is something that most people will thankfully never have to experience			2
' a number of years had passed since the trial and @entity1 ’s death and was it right for us to cause even more upset and distress by making the families relive this yet again ? ' no part of any murder investigation is simple and every decision is made with the best of intentions ; how much should we tell families ? how much do they want to know ? the facts of any such case are distressing enough but do we add to this with even more detail ? these are questions that officers are faced with on a daily basis			1
appeal : police kept the remains in case @entity1 , the wife of the serial killer , decided to appeal against his conviction years after his death victim : the grave of @entity42 ( left ) who sparked the murder investigation			1
her daughter went to police after @entity132 's will was altered in favour of @entity1			2
the probe uncovered a number of suspicious deaths			0
pictured right is @entity138 , the son of @entity139 , who was a victim of dr @entity1 ' as soon as we knew that a journalist had become aware of this , specially trained officers visited all of the families involved and fully explained our rationale which they all took on board and fully understood			1
we now continue to support these families as they are now forced to relive the hurt and upset yet again			0
' @entity1 , the @entity149 ’s most prolific convicted serial killer , was jailed for life in 2000 for murdering 15 patients using the drug @entity3 while working in @entity153 , @entity154			0
nine of these victims were exhumed and three other victims who were not in the court case also had their remains dug up			0
police said that some human tissue was retained as evidence until a meeting in october 2007 when they decided to hold on to the samples for another five years , in case of any further legal challenge by @entity1 's widow @entity167			2
the decision was reviewed in 2010 , after the @entity169 asked all police forces to conduct an audit of human tissue in storage in the wake of the @entity175			0
a force spokeswoman said that since there had been no legal challenges , the decision was taken to ' respectfully dispose ' of the human tissue in february 2011			0
an inquiry concluded he killed between 215 and 260 people over a 23 - year period in @entity153 and @entity183 , @entity184			1
he committed suicide in january 2004 .			0
