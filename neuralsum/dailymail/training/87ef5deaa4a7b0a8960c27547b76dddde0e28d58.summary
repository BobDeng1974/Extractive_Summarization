@entity0 is a man determined not to let one aspect of who he is define him			1
born with a congenital disorder which prevented the growth of his lower spine and sacrum , @entity0 has spent his life doing exactly what he believes he should be doing - living life to the full			1
‘ you always have the ability within to live your life , pushing the limits , ' the three - time paralympic gold medallist told @entity15			1
' if you learn to accept yourself you ca n't just accept bits and pieces			0
i could n't imagine my life any other way			2
disability is just another aspect of a person			2
' ‘ you always have the ability within to live your life , pushing the limits , ' the three - time paralympic gold medalist told @entity15 ‘ if i were offered the chance to walk tomorrow i would jump at it , but if it meant losing the person i have become i would not swap it in a million years , ' @entity0 said ‘ people have this idea that struggling is a bad thing , but struggling is brilliant			1
if you see someone struggle and overcome it , it is infectious			0
it makes you feel good to be alive			0
’ from the man who has won has won the @entity41 wheelchair marathon five times , sailed the @entity43 to @entity45 race , was recognised as the 2009 @entity46 , and was awarded the @entity47 , this seems like advice from experience			2
‘ if i were offered the chance to walk tomorrow i would jump at it , but if it meant losing the person i have become i would not swap it in a million years , ' @entity0 said in his new memoir , pushing the @entity57			1
' if i could choose between the reality of walking and the idea that i could achieve anything i set out to do , i would take the idea every time			2
’ in 2009 , @entity0 took on a challenge that would make even the most hardened athlete balk - conquering the @entity65			1
the ten - day hike is considered one of the most formidable treks in the world , along the unforgiving landscape of the @entity71 in @entity73 's mountains and dense forest			1
@entity0 has won the @entity41 wheelchair marathon five times , sailed the @entity43 to @entity45 race , was recognised as the 2009 @entity46 , and was awarded the @entity47 @entity0 decided that he would crawl the 96 kilometre trail , and set out to train himself mentally , physically and spiritually , and knowing that he would be in the company of his family and friends gave the preparation a focus despite this , @entity0 said that the thought that he would n't take on the test of endurance simply because of his disability never entered his mind			1
' i grew up with the idea that life can be hard			2
there 's no way i would choose to live a life sitting on the sidelines			2
i 'm here , i 'm in it and i 'm part of it			0
if i am remembered for anything i want to be remembered for this : i was prepared to grab hold of life and rip it to pieces			2
' the idea for the epic hike began among tragic circumstances , following the unexpected death of his cousin @entity106 in a car accident			1
the media - dubbed ' wheelchair marathon man ' said that the idea bubbled away under the surface for a few months , but began to take shape when his brothers , many of his cousins , and five of his friends all committed to the idea as a way of reinforcing the bond between them which had resurfaced in the wake of @entity106 's death			1
after reading a compelling account of a @entity124 solider who had been shot in both ankles and dragged himself along the @entity65 rather than make his fellow soldiers carry him , @entity0 was inspired , and his determination to tackle the track reinvigorated			1
he decided that he would crawl the 96 kilometre trail , and set out to train himself mentally , physically and spiritually , and knowing that he would be in the company of his family and friends gave the preparation a focus			1
' life 's not about watching			2
it 's about getting in there and getting your hands dirty and being a part of it , ' @entity0 said ' we all have the ability to be who we want to be , and we have to choose that and choose it repeatedly , because going through hardship is not all about gold or joy , ' @entity0 said ‘ our motivation was to be there together and to be there for each other			1
it was not about me trying to prove that i could crawl every metre of the way , ' he wrote			0
' it was not about me trying to prove anything			0
i did n’t need to drag myself bloody			0
this was not a competition or a race			0
if i , or any of us , needed to be helped or supported or carried for a while , we knew we had only to ask			0
’ on the eve of the hike , @entity0 and his fellow hikers were meeting some of the locals , when a man who had grown up on the trail but had broken his back told the @entity172 that in his culture , children with disabilities were hidden , or kept to the side of rooms , and not allowed to interact with the wider community			1
he told @entity185 , ‘ while you ’re crawling on the track you ’re going to make people question that belief			0
every person with a disability that ’s being kept in those rooms , they ’re going to be with you on the track			2
they ’re going to be there on your shoulders			0
’ @entity0 said that the powerful assertion weighed heavily on him , and made him reassess the impact that his journey would have not only on himself , but on others who looked up to him and saw him as a beacon for change			1
‘ right hang on , this has become much bigger than i ever intended , or ever imagined , ' he said			0
he has got through a lot of challenges thanks to the support of family and friends @entity0 ( pictured far left ) with his family wife @entity206 and son @entity207 got to open the @entity208 after the @entity41 marathon throughout the gruelling journey , @entity0 found himself constantly bombarded by experiences and emotions he had n't expected			1
from his injuries sustained from crawling across mud - splattered ground and scattered debris , to developing an intimate bond with his @entity73 ' porters ' who helped him scale some of the impenetrable track , @entity0 found himself acutely aware of , and even uncomfortable with , asking for assistance			1
‘ being a man who is so intent on being self - sufficient , it was disconcerting to feel that i genuinely needed help to continue and that there was nothing wrong with asking for it			2
’ however , following the trail which was haunted with the memories and sacrifices of the soldiers who had journeyed the distance , out of fear and necessity rather than willingly , was one of the most emotionally significant aspects of the trek			0
the group reached @entity238 , the site where more @entity240 casualties died in @entity73 than any other , on @entity241 , which @entity0 said was a profoundly moving experience			1
‘ we sat there visualising the conflict , and how surreal and mournful the experience must have been for those young soldiers almost seven decades earlier , ' he said			0
‘ many were brave and idealistic striplings laying down their lives in a strange and unforgiving land			0
’ ‘ i have believed the constant hum in my ears telling me that i am powerful and that the world is my canvas , to colour as i see fit , ' said @entity200 three time @entity172 gold medallist @entity0 ( pictured ) has taken on many challenges including sailing the @entity43 to @entity45 race ‘ it made me think about the people who were calling me a hero for crawling the track			1
the heroes were the soldiers and the @entity264 who had slogged it out in 1942			0
i was just a fella trying to get as much as i could out of life , ' he said in his memoir			1
@entity0 decidedly did exactly that on the @entity65 , losing seven kilos from the sheer effort of pulling himself by his arms along the track			1
arriving at the end , he said that he and his travelling companions had achieved more than they thought they were capable of			0
‘ we felt like we had plunged to the worst lows and soared to the greatest heights , and now that we had endured it all , we felt indomitable			0
as though there was nothing , physically , mentally , or emotionally , that we could not endure			0
’ ‘ i have believed the constant hum in my ears telling me that i am powerful and that the world is my canvas , to colour as i see fit			2
at some point that feedback took hold , my world shifted , and i understood that disability would never be a weight and would never drag me down			1
' @entity0 ( pictured bottom right ) celebrates with friends after winning the @entity41 wheelchair marathon for @entity0 , the battle to overcome @entity65 was significant , but certainly was n't the only challenge he has faced in his life , nor will it be the last			1
this is not something that daunts this man , who crawled @entity298 , who seeks to push himself , and who never wants himself , or anyone else with a disability , to be limited by an aspect that does not define them			1
' life 's not about watching			0
it 's about getting in there and getting your hands dirty and being a part of it , ' he said			0
' that ’s what i consider to be living			0
i was the beneficiaries of people who would stand up when i could n’t , and if my story helps even one kid to have a better quality of life , that 's amazing			2
' ' we all have the ability to be who we want to be , and we have to choose that and choose it repeatedly , because going through hardship is not all about gold or joy			0
' ' life is about making it through the more shadowy moments and harder periods			0
that ’s as much who you are as the other parts , and we should have as much pride attached to that as anything else			0

@entity0 , three - time @entity342 , has *released* his memoir , ' pushing the @entity57 ' , which details his life and his determination to never let his disability define him
in 2009 @entity0 crawled the 96 kilometre @entity65 , which is among the toughest tracks in the world
he was accompanied by his brothers , cousins and friends , to remember the passing of his cousin @entity106 who died *suddenly* in a car crash
he said it was the most memorable thing he has ever done , and hopes that his story will inspire others to not place limitations on others with disabilities
