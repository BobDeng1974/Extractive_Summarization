by @entity0 published : 02:51 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 25 october 2013 defeat : @entity2 leader @entity1 has seen his majority in the @entity4 cut to just two @entity5 's first minister @entity1 has suffered a crushing by - election defeat that leaves the @entity2 with a wafer - thin majority in the @entity4			1
@entity10 won the contest in @entity12 , @entity13 , by 2,873 votes after a fierce battle that saw an unexpectedly high turnout of 42.75 per cent			1
mr @entity1 was left personally humiliated after he made a last - minute appearance on doorsteps yesterday evening in a bid to pick up votes			1
but @entity10 won 42.5 per cent of the vote , with the @entity2 on 30.6 per cent - a swing to @entity10 of 6.9 per cent			1
winning candidate @entity23 was heckled and booed by @entity2 activists as she made her victory speech			0
she claimed the result sends a clear message to mr @entity1 ahead of next year ’s referendum on @entity5 independence			2
the @entity30 came third with 11.8 per cent , followed by the @entity31 on 8.3 per cent , @entity32 on 3.8 per cent and the @entity33 on 2.5 per cent			0
@entity12 was a former @entity30 stronghold , but fell to mr @entity1 ’s @entity2 in his 2011 @entity36 landslide			1
@entity10 ’s victory is a significant boost for the party ’s @entity5 leader , @entity39 , and throws the next @entity4 elections in 2016 wide open			0
it is the first time a seat has changed hands in a @entity4 by - election for 13 years			2
it comes just months after the @entity2 ’s majority in a by - election in @entity50 was slashed and only weeks after @entity10 trounced their main opponents north of the @entity52 in a council by - election in @entity57 ’s @entity56 ward			1
the result also casts further doubt on mr @entity1 ’s chances of winning next year ’s independence referendum , with polls suggesting fewer than 30 per cent of @entity5 want to leave the @entity63			2
winner : @entity10 's @entity23 , pictured with shadow chancellor @entity65 , secured a majority of 2,873 in the @entity12 by - election the by - election was held following the resignation of disgraced wife - beater @entity70 , who had been kicked out of the @entity2			1
earlier this year he was found guilty of 23 counts of domestic abuse against three former wives and a stepdaughter			0
@entity10 ’s victory leaves mr @entity1 with a slender parliamentary majority of just two			1
he now has 65 @entity78 - down from 69 in 2011 - with the combined opposition forces on 63			0
miss @entity23 said : ' the people of @entity12 have rejected @entity5 being put on pause for another year			2
' the government of @entity5 has been suspended so that a referendum campaign can be won			0
' we need a @entity85 that will address the needs of @entity5 , not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after [ independence ]			0
' @entity12 has sent a message to @entity1 : it 's time for you to focus on the real priorities of @entity5 , not your constitutional obsession			2
' use the powers you have now to make a difference , not just argue for more in the future			0
' count : the contest in @entity12 was dominated by a local row over @entity10 - run @entity102 ¿ s plan to close primary schools surprise : @entity10 's victory throws the next @entity4 elections in 2016 wide open @entity2 business convener @entity109 said : ' the @entity2 fought a strong campaign with an excellent candidate in @entity112 , and we made the issues of the by - election the issues that matter to the people - saving local schools , and protecting vital public services			1
' in the event , the seat was just too marginal , and we wish @entity23 well in representing the people of @entity12 and the @entity13 villages			0
' however , the swing of just 6.9 per cent to @entity10 is extremely small			0
it is even less than @entity10 achieved in the @entity126 by - election just a few months ago , and is one of the lowest by - election swings in the history of the @entity4 - which indicates the underlying strength of the @entity2 after six - and - a - half years in government			1
' the contest in @entity12 was dominated by a local row over @entity10 - run @entity102 ’s plan to close primary schools			1
that should have helped the @entity2 and the party ’s candidate - former @entity78 miss @entity140 - who was widely considered a much more accomplished performer than miss @entity23			2
@entity10 also faced ridicule following the publication of a leaflet that listed a series of @entity2 policies - including the abolition of bridge tolls and a council tax freeze - and presented them as the party ’s own ideas			1
countdown : voters in @entity5 will go to the polls in the scottish independence referendum in september next year but mr @entity1 suffered his own setback this week after he turned up at a closure - threatened school in a last - ditch attempt to boost support for the @entity2			1
@entity161 had actually been forced to shut its doors hours earlier because the creaking boiler system failed to work			0
seven candidates were contesting the seat , with university lecturer @entity166 standing for the @entity30			0
her party continues to be punished by @entity5 voters for joining the @entity31 in coalition at @entity170			0
the @entity31 chose 22 - year - old @entity171 , pro-independence campaigner @entity172 contested the by - election for the @entity33 , and @entity32 ’s regional organiser in @entity5 , @entity175 , also stood			2
there was one independent candidate on the ballot paper - @entity178 - who has previously been involved with the @entity180 .			0

@entity10 wins @entity12 by - election with majority of 2,873 over @entity2
@entity1 personally humiliated after making appearance on doorsteps
