a man is awaiting trial over the vandalism			0
the tears to the painting from 1874 , called @entity17 , laid end to end would have been about a foot long in an artwork less than four feet square			2
the £ 8million @entity2 , called @entity21 , after it was damaged while hanging in the @entity10 , @entity11 , in 2012 @entity23 , managing director of @entity25 , who helped fun the repairs , and @entity27 , @entity28 , unveil the restored artwork the varnish that covers the oil paint was also cleaned before the artwork was returned to the gallery giving it a brighter finish more reminiscent of how it originally looked 140 years ago @entity2 's painting , the only one in @entity37 's national collection , depicts the shifting clouds , rippled water , golden leaves and a gliding yacht which gives a sense of transience @entity44 , director of the @entity10 of @entity37 , likened the meticulous repair to microscopic needlework			1
' it was huge damage , shocking damage , ' he said			0
' this project to restore and conserve one of the gallery 's most popular impressionist works of art is testament to the outstanding expertise and dedication of our professional team of conservators			0
' the oil painting - the only @entity2 in @entity37 's national collection - is relatively small at 55cm by 65cm but is regarded as a classic			1
mr @entity23 and ms @entity28 look over the restored artwork which is now housed behind protective glass it was painted at a time when @entity2 was using a boat as a floating studio on the @entity69 to paint scenes of the river and its banks			2
it is now being housed behind protective glass - a low reflective , ultraviolet - filtered climate box with a humidity buffer			0

the director of the @entity10 of @entity37 said the quality of the restoration was a testament to the ' outstanding expertise and dedication ' of those involved in the lengthily project it depicts the shifting clouds , rippled water , golden leaves and a gliding yacht which gives a sense of transience			1
the painting was bequeathed to the @entity99 state by dramatist and politician @entity100 who bought it on the advice of his cousin , the writer @entity105			0
the repair work involved gathering hundreds of microscopic fragments of paint which broke off the canvas during the vandalism - most measured 0.3 - 1mm across			1
@entity112 , director of the @entity10 , mr @entity23 , and managing director of the @entity114 speak before the unveiling seven per cent of the pieces could not be saved , some splitting into powdery dust , too tiny to reattach in the jigsaw restoration			1
conservationists removed the painting from its frame and delicately sewed together thousands of fine threads which made up the canvass			2
under a microscope and using surgical tools and special heaters , they reattached fine materials with a specially formulated adhesive			1
the varnish which covers the oil paint was also been cleaned before the artwork returned to the gallery giving it a brighter and fresher feel , closer to what it the original work looked like 140 years ago			2
the canvass has been lined across the back to provide additional support			0
the restoration was supported by @entity25 , with @entity142 , @entity28 being hired to undertake the work .			0

the delicate restoration took 18 months to complete
with conservationists using microscopes and surgical tools
to reinstate hundreds of microscopic fragments of paint
the artwork was vandalised while it hung in the @entity10 of @entity37
