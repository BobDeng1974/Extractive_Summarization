food firms have been warned about the presence of a cancer - risk chemical in everyday products ranging from crisps and chips to instant coffee and ginger biscuits			1
a biscuit designed for babies and toddlers has also been caught up in the alert			0
experts are even warning families to only lightly toast their bread at home , as the chemical , called acrylamide , is more likely to form the longer and darker foods cook			1
a study by the @entity20 has identified 13 products containing raised levels of the chemical			1
in each case , officials at the local council where the supplier is based have been told to notify them			0
study : the @entity20 has identified 13 products containing raised levels of the chemical acrylamide acrylamide , which is still being investigated by scientists , is a cooking by - product associated with frying , baking , roasting or toasting foods at very high temperatures , usually greater than 120c			1
the @entity20 insists its findings raise no immediate risk to the public and there is no need for people to change their diet			0
however , it is putting pressure on all food companies to reduce acrylamide levels because long - term consumption could increase the risk of cancer			1
its official advice is also that families should ensure bread and chips they eat are only toasted or baked to the ' lightest colour possible '			0
the @entity20 said its study of levels of acrylamide and furan – another cancer - risk chemical – is used to identify which firms need to take action			1
acrylamide is formed by a reaction between natural components in food as it cooks			2
in reality it has probably been in the diet for as long as man has fried , roasted or toasted food			0
manufacturers including @entity77 and @entity78 's have already responded by changing their recipes			1
warned : food firms have been cautioned that everyday products such as crisps , biscuits and instant coffee could contain the cancer - risk chemical acrylamide but others , including @entity89 , makers of @entity87 , say it is impossible to do so without harming the flavour and quality of their products			1
it added : ' there is currently no scientific evidence to suggest any particular product has any negative impact on health in the context of acrylamide exposure			2
' the @entity20 is required by the @entity103 and the @entity104 to carry out the annual tests			0
it looked at 248 samples , from chips sold by fast - food outlets to supermarket own - label and big brand ranges			0
in 13 cases levels were above the ' indicative value ' – a trigger point to tell the firm it should examine its production process			0
at risk : the @entity20 has warned food firms that everyday products such as instant coffee could contain the cancer chemical acrylamide @entity123 watchdogs have been putting pressure on food manufacturers to reduce acrylamide for almost a decade			1
in 2002 @entity128 studies revealed high levels formed during the frying or baking of potato or cereal products			2
the @entity20 said : ' this raised worldwide public concern because studies in laboratory animals suggest acrylamide has the potential to cause cancer in humans by interacting with the dna in cells			2
' @entity144 believes exposure to such chemicals should be as low as reasonably practicable			0
' the latest survey found ' an upward trend ' in acrylamide levels in processed cereal - based baby foods , excluding rusks			1
importantly however , the @entity20 said this did not mean parents should stop giving these products to youngsters			2
the @entity156 , which represents manufacturers , said members are ' ensuring levels are as low as reasonably achievable '			0
@entity77 changed its @entity161 recipe this year to reduce acrylamide to trace levels			1
@entity164 , which makes @entity165 , said it has cut acrylamide by 70 per cent			0
the firm also pledged to cut levels in its @entity170 ’s crisps .			0

acrylamide also likely to form in burned toast
found in products from a number of top firms including @entity77 and @entity87
