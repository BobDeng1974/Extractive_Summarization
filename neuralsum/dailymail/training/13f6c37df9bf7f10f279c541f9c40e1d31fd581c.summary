manager @entity0 is confident @entity1 will not be caught out by the early kick - off time when they host @entity4 on saturday lunchtime			1
the @entity6 struggled in their early away @entity8 games last season , beaten 6 - 3 at the @entity10 , before going down 5 - 1 at @entity11 and then humiliated 6 - 0 by @entity13 rivals @entity12 in march , which was @entity0 's 1,000th match in charge			1
@entity0 , however , insists there is no reason to believe his team - which could include a debut for @entity20 forward @entity21 following his Â£ 16million deadline day switch from @entity24 - will have no problems with a slow start this time around			1
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity1 boss @entity0 is adamant the @entity6 will manage to perform in saturday 's early kick - off @entity20 striker @entity21 is in line to make his @entity1 debut at the @entity31 on saturday @entity1 players get physical in training before their tough encounter with @entity4 on saturday @entity1 vs clubs that finished in the top four since 2009 - 2010 : @entity36 30 w 7 d 5 l 18 f 35 a 59 pts 26 ' at home , we have played well at 12:45			1
in the @entity39 , we had great games at 12.45			0
it is not the kick - off time , it is your performance , how you turn up , ' said @entity0			1
' at 12:45 or three o'clock - for me that is just talk , the rest is the quality of the performance that counts			0
' @entity0 continued : ' [ we were worse ] away from home , but i think the coincidence was that we played against very strong teams away from home at 12:45			0
' i think it was more the quality of our opponents and the lack of quality in our performance that produced a result , not the kick - off time			2
@entity4 put six past @entity1 shortly before @entity61 last season in one of the early kick - off defeats @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity68 muck around in training as @entity1 prepare for @entity4 's visit right - back @entity71 holds of forward @entity73 in @entity1 training @entity75 international @entity73 listens to some instructions from @entity0 in training @entity1 's summer signing @entity77 takes time out during the training session you can like our @entity83 page here ... ' i have heard that many times - would you rather kick - off at three o'clock or 12:45 ? it is two hours and 15 minutes , that does not produce a miracle in your physical recovery			1
' sometimes maybe , on our side , we go a bit too much overboard on that			0
i think 12:45 is a good kick - off time			2
' @entity1 are yet to lose a @entity8 game , but were held to a goalless draw at @entity98 before the international break			0
the @entity6 have already beaten @entity101 's men once this season , sweeping aside an under - strength team 3 - 0 in the @entity104 at @entity105 on august 10			2
@entity106 has been urged to move forward and add more goals to his game as he progresses this season @entity1 forwards @entity109 and @entity73 are all smiles during training but probably wo n't start @entity0 feels saturday 's match , for which @entity115 midfielder @entity114 is a doubt because of an ankle injury , provides another chance for @entity1 to prove they can cut it with the @entity8 title contenders			1
' we have now got the opportunity to show that we have grown as a team , that we are more mature and ready for the fight , so let 's do it , ' he said			0
' i do n't think that this game is very important for us mathematically because we dropped points away from home , but it gives us credibility and confidence to do well			0
' the @entity8 this year is very , very important for us and of course a game against @entity4 becomes a very important game			0
' @entity1 goalkeeper @entity136 will hope to prevent @entity4 scoring at the @entity31 @entity137 ( centre ) will hope to start at the @entity31 having impressed recently off the bench			2
