by @entity0 from visiting famous landmarks from your sofa , to looking for strange sites , @entity2 ’s @entity1 has many uses			2
now scientists have used photos of streets in @entity12 cities to make maps showing the safety of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 - based on how people rated photos on a website			1
the @entity23 project works out which areas of a city are seen as rich and safe , family - friendly or dangerous , according to how people react to @entity1 images			1
scientists have used photos of streets in @entity12 cities to make maps showing the safety of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , based on how people rated photos on the website			1
click on the interactive maps above to see streets that are perceived to be safe ( marked in green ) and less desirable addresses ( in red ) scientists at @entity41 ( @entity41 ) created the survey to let people choose between two streets , to indicate which they believe to be safer			1
they then used the information , and collected the safety rankings for 3,000 images from @entity15 and @entity18 , to generate an algorithm that automatically creates a safety rating for the images			2
this is based upon features such as colours and shapes			0
the experts use the algorithm to predict the safety score of any image on @entity1 , based on the outcome of its @entity23 survey			2
the researchers have now released four maps to show the perceived dangerous and safe areas of @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity16			1
scientists at @entity41 created the survey to let people choose between two streets , to indicate which they believe to be safer			1
from the initial results they made an algorithm create a safety score of a neighbourhood - zero being the lowest to denote a dangerous street and 10 the highest - and predict its safety place pulse 2.0 is a more in - depth survey that is collecting data on 100,000 street views from 56 different cities , including @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
as well as choosing roads that look the safest , survey participants can also choose views based on which look livelier , wealthier , most beautiful , boring or depressing			1
based on the results so far , @entity81 , @entity86 and @entity15 have been voted the liveliest cities according to the @entity1 photos			2
@entity90 is currently ranked the most beautiful of cities and @entity92 the most depressing - although the @entity94 @entity93 have not been taken into account			0
@entity97 areas of the map represent areas , which were given a high perceived safety rating using the algorithm , while red areas show locations that are perceived as dangerous			1
the map of @entity15 contains more than 300,000 data points of perceived safety			0
the scientists developed their algorithm because to make such a detailed map without it would have required more than two million comparisons of images			0
by using @entity112 they could create the maps using less than 3,000 images – or 24,000 comparisons – in the dataset			0
the new tool allows experts to look at urban environments in a new way , and in the future , @entity41 will use it to study improvements and decay in cities			0
‘ we can use @entity112 to explore the determinants of urban perception , including both the local features that affect people 's perception of a street view , such as the quality of buildings ... the local context of a neighbourhood … such as its proximity to a highway … and the historical , economic and demographic forces that shape a city , such as architectural movements … and social segregation , ’ they explained			0
the map of @entity15 ( pictured ) contains more than 300,000 data points of perceived @entity144 scientists developed their algorithm because , to make such a detailed map without it , would have required more than two million comparisons of images place pulse 2.0 is now underway , and the new survey is collecting data on 100,000 street views from 56 different cities , including @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1

this screenshot shows a choice of roads where users are encouraged to click on the one that looks safest			0
@entity79 is currently in the lead when it comes to the safest - looking streets			0

scientists at @entity41 have created maps of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18
red areas denote streets that have been perceived to be dangerous
green *zones* show the roads that are thought to be more *welcoming*
maps are based on a survey where people clicked on @entity1 images to choose which scene looked safer
@entity188 was used to create an algorithm to predict which roads look safe
a new survey is *inviting* people to choose views that look beautiful , boring and depressing , so that more algorithms and maps can be created
