by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 17 may 2013 doctors , nurses , teachers and local government staff will see the income from their ' gold - plated ' public sector pensions slashed by more than a third under the government 's reform plans			1
some four million public sector workers will see their retirement income take a huge hit as the government looks to cut its pension liabilities by a quarter by 2065			1
paying out pensions based on a proportion of average career earnings , rather than final salaries , will see workers ' average pension income fall from 23 per cent of their salary to just 15 per cent , the @entity15 has said today			1
pension pain : how the government 's reforms will impact members of the four main public service pension schemes			2
those who turned 50 before april 1 , 2012 , will be protected from the reforms , but everyone else faces having to work for longer , pay more into their pots , and get less out of their pensions			0
local government workers will experience the changes first as the reforms are introduced from next april , with @entity38 staff , teachers and government civil servants following suit in april 2015			1
despite this , the @entity15 found that public sector pensions will still provide better levels of income than private sector workers on money purchase schemes			1
@entity49 , @entity15 director , said : ' the analysis suggests that the combined impact of the @entity25 ’s proposed reforms is to reduce the average value of the pension benefit for all members of the @entity38 , teachers , local government and civil service pension schemes from 23 per cent of a member ’s salary before the @entity25 ’s reforms , to 15 per cent			1
' this is a reduction in the average value of the pension benefit for members of these four schemes of more than a third			0
' nevertheless , even after the @entity25 ’s proposed reforms , the benefit offered by all four of the largest public service pension schemes remains more valuable , on average , than the pension benefit offered by defined contribution schemes that are now most commonly offered to employees in the private sector			2
' final salary schemes see staff given a proportion of their final salary , typically 1/60th , as income in retirement for every year they have worked with the organisation			2
so someone with 40 years service , who retired on a salary of £ 60,000 , can expect a retirement income of £ 40,000			2
but career average pensions will see the payouts calculated based on an average of pensionable earnings for each year they worked			2
the reforms were first brought up in the @entity91 , and received @entity92 last month			0
other changes include bringing the age at which staff can take their pensions , which is currently 60 for most members , in line with the state pension age			0
this will rise for men and woman to 67 between 2026 and 2028			0
members will have to pay on average an extra 3.2 per cent of their salary into their pension schemes as well			0
affected : @entity38 staff , teachers and local government workers will be hit by the changes			1
police , fire and @entity113 personnel are also expected to be affected by the changes , though their ' normal pension age ' will remain at 60			0
in 2007/08 reforms introduced by @entity116 , the normal pension age for civil service , nhs and teacher pension schemes rose from 60 to 65			0
however this only applied to new members , so the majority of scheme members will still have a pension age of 60			0
those within 10 years of their pension age on april 1 , 2012 , will be able to take their pension under the current final salary conditions , rather than the new career average .			1

four million public sector workers will see their pension earnings reduce
retirement income calculated on career average earnings , not final salary
@entity38 staff , teachers and local government workers among worst hit
