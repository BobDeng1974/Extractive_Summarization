a grandmother whose life - long struggle with her weight left her desperate , isolated and on the brink of suicide has managed to turn her life around			1
@entity7 , 49 , from @entity8 , lost an incredible 13st in less than a year after hitting rock bottom , and now says her only regret is that her father , whom she cared for for years , never got to see her transform her life			1
@entity7 has gone from a size 30 who wore a @entity16 bra to a size 10 after dropping from 24st to 11st , losing more than a stone a month by following the unusual @entity20 diet at a clinic in @entity22			1
@entity7 said : ' i had got to the stage where i was repulsed by myself			1
i was desperate , i would have cut my legs off to lose weight			1
@entity7 's size ( left ) impacted her self esteem so dramatically that she would barely leave the house but now she feels she has a new lease on life ( right ) ' it destroyed my life			1
i never looked at myself in the mirror and i would never weigh myself			2
i did n't realise how heavy i was			2
@entity7 gave up work to care for her seriously ill father ' in the end it made me suicidal			1
i got to the point where i thought i ca n't go on			2
it really was do or die			2
thank @entity54 , i decided i want to live			1
' the mother - of - two worked at @entity57 plastic manufacturers in @entity8 as a forklift truck driver before giving up in 2002 , to care for her seriously ill father			1
she used her life savings to pay for the diet , which has cost her Â£ 7,000 , but says it was worth every penny			1
@entity7 , a grandmother - of - two , said : ' i found it easy , i was n't hungry and i never gained weight once - the first week i lost 12lb			1
' she began her diet last november and was so committed that even her @entity69 dinner was a 100 calorie shake			2
she said : ' i cooked turkey and all the trimmings for the family but i had a vanilla shake made from powder and water			2
this year i plan to be eating turkey though			1
' @entity7 's weight problems began as a child			1
she added : ' i was always chubby			2
it really got out of hand after my second child @entity81 was born			2
i tried everything , i even did the cabbage soup diet for six months			2
' it had got to the stage where i was afraid of food			2
i ruined my metabolism by trying to starve myself			2
i never sat down to eat a proper meal , i just snacked constantly , drank coffee and smoked			2
having struggled with her weight since childhood ( left , aged three ) , @entity7 can now fit into one of her old t - shirts with her daughter @entity81 ( right ) ' my only regret is that my dad @entity96 did n't live to see me like this , but the rest of my family are thrilled and i 'm happier and healthier than i have ever been			1
' people following the diet are given five portions of ' food ' a day , each containing 108 calories			2
some are sachets that can be made into drinks , others are food like protein bars			2
dieters also have to take six different supplements each day and drink plenty of water			2
once a week you visit the clinic to be weighed and have a blood test and blood pressure test			1
every four weeks you are seen by a doctor for a check up			2
@entity122 , who has been married for 13 years , says she was always chubby as a child and by the time she was 16 she weighed 13st			2
she had a very loving home , but her would was turned upside down when her father , @entity96 , a policeman , had a brain haemorrhage when she was six			1
he was bed bound for 42 years until his death a year ago			1
' when i was six my dad fell ill. he had a brain haemorrhage and he could n't speak or walk after that			1
' he had 14 to 15 epileptic fits a day			2
i was brought up with a lot of sickness but i felt very loved			2
my dad was my hero			0
' my dad travelled all over the world with the navy , but he could never tell me the stories about his life because he could n't speak			1
' he had bowel cancers and gall bladder cancer when he died			0
he had been in bed for 42 years			0
' me and my mum , @entity142 , never begrudged looking after him			0
he was my hero without a doubt			0
' in the years afterwards being so heavy began to whittle away at @entity7 's confidence			1
@entity7 now says her only regret is that her father , whom she cared for for years , never got to see her transform her life ' i would wear baggy tops			1
i was disgusted with myself			0
i would just cover what part of my body i could			0
i had to cover myself up so i could n't see it never mind other people			0
' i would always wear black clothes , a black top and black pants			0
at the end i only had one set of clothes that would fit me so i had to wash them every night and dry them overnight			0
@entity166 spokesperson , @entity164 says : ' at a quick glance , @entity162 therapy is an expensive low calorie meal replacement diet which claims to offer structured support to return to normal and healthy eating			0
' many people find this a useful method of tackling the very difficult task of losing weight			1
with the right support and attitude , this can be an appropriate weight loss method for some individuals			1
however , as with any weight management interventions , short term weight loss does not indicate success and long term weight maintenance is the most important and difficult goal			1
' i do have concerns about the ethics of the advertising and wording used on this companies websites			0
@entity190 makes specific scientific claims such as ' stabilising blood glucose ' and ' breakdown of stored body fat ' , however these are common principles of any healthy eating advice and evidence based weight loss programmes			1
unfortunately , i was unable to locate any scientific evidence to support this			0
without further information , i would certainly not recommend @entity201 as superior to any other calorie restrictive diets with support to return to normal eating			0
' in summary , some people may find this type of treatment useful , however obesity and weight loss is a complex and individual disease			1
there is no ' one size fits all ' approach to weight loss and companies need to be careful they are not exploiting vulnerable clients looking for a ' quick fix ' with expensive and treatments which are not maintainable			1
' ' any clothes i did buy i would buy online			0
i was too embarrassed to go into a shop			0
that was part of the problem			0
it does n't worry some people who are overweight to go out in public			0
' but i am a shy and reserved person anyway			0
when you are overweight that makes it even worse			0
i could n't be seen in public			0
' people do look at you if you are fat and they ca n't help but judge you			0
when someone says it does n't bother them i think they they are lying			0
' you would prefer to be slim			0
' i just stopped going out completely			0
' if there was a family meal or celebration i never used to go			0
it might sound funny but i was never a really big eater			0
' i had been on so many yo yo diets that it was destroying my insides			0
' ' i did n't know which way to turn or how to get rid of this weight			1
i used to wake up in this morning and i felt as if i was carrying a big boulder on my back			0
' i had to care for my dad			1
in the evenings i would just lie on the sofa and watch tv			0
and then i could n't get up i was that big			0
' so a few weeks before my dad passed away i decided to go to this clinic and make this appointment			1
' they were so good			0
a year before i would never had the courage to even go there because of how i looked			1
but i had reached rock bottom and i just stopped caring			1
' i was at the lowest ebb			0
they were brilliant at the clinic			1
i wish this was was available on the @entity265			0
the success rate would be astronomical , but the @entity265 ca n't fund something so expensive			0
' this treatment has saved my life in one way			1
if i had carried on the way i was going my heart would have packed in because of the strain			0
i could have died before i even had the treatment i was that big			0
breakfast : several of 30 daily cups of coffee made with milk lunch : @entity281 coffee dinner : roast chicken dinner ; milky coffee snacks : bread , biscuits and cereal , sometimes eating until 3am			1
more milky coffee breakfast : @entity290 with low - fat yoghurt mid morning : some grapefruit lunch : tuna salad mid afternoon : some fruit evening : a stir fry with green veg			1
