by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 16:20 est , 19 may 2012 more of us than ever are living on our own – and it seems that the solo lifestyle could be a cause of poor mental health			1
a third of @entity7 live alone			1
the latest figures from the @entity9 show that divorce rates are rising and fewer people are getting married			1
it is estimated that by 2020 , 40 per cent of households will have only one person			2
but now a study suggests that those living alone are 80 per cent more likely to be depressed than those who co-habit			2
shocking : between 2002 and 2008 , those people living alone were 1.8 times more likely to purchase antidepressants researchers in @entity21 followed 1,695 @entity21 men and 1,776 women aged between 30 and 65 for seven years , of whom 14 per cent lived alone			1
use of antidepressants was monitored simultaneously through national prescription registers			1
between 2002 and 2008 , those people living alone were 1.8 times more likely to purchase antidepressants			1
researchers attributed this discrepancy to a number of reasons			2
lack of social support was a major risk factor in men and poverty was more likely to affect women			2

‘ we know that loneliness is a major factor in depression , ’ says consultant psychiatrist dr @entity40 , at @entity41 in @entity42			0

‘ i ’d suggest about one in 20 @entity7 is on antidepressants			1
a large proportion of those are likely to live on their own , ’ he says			0
impact : lack of social support was a major risk factor in men and poverty was more likely to affect women although it may seem surprising that those of working age are so prone to depression – presumably those with jobs have daily interaction with others – dr @entity40 points out that the current economic climate has put great pressure on employees			0
‘ if you are lucky enough to have a job , you are probably working longer hours and expectations will be higher , ’ he says			0
‘ this stress is hugely alleviated if you have someone at home with whom you can laugh or complain to			0
marriage brings a decreased risk for all psychiatric problems			0
’ of course , if you are n’t working then this is an extra reason for low moods			0
so what can you do ? ‘ join a gym or a group in the evenings to improve your social life , ’ dr @entity40 suggests			0
‘ alternatively get a pet – they are proven to help with psychological problems			0
flat - sharing or getting a lodger are also great ways to save money and stay social			0

one in 20 @entity7 is on antidepressants
