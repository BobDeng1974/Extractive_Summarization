a stunned family who thought their pet cat had come back from the dead just 24 hours after his funeral realised they had buried the wrong animal			1
mother - of - two @entity7 , 48 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , was heartbroken when she spotted what she believed was her missing black @entity12 dead at the side of a busy road			1
a passer - by then told the family that the creature had been hit by a passing car and killed instantly			2
reunited : mother - of - two @entity7 , 48 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , is pictured with her cat @entity12 after the brief scare the tearful owner scooped up the dead animal , convinced it was her beloved two - year - old pet , because it was the same size and had the same coloured fur and eyes			1
her son @entity27 , 22 , spent two hours digging a grave in the back garden before the whole family buried the cat with @entity12 's favourite toy mouse			1
after the hour - long ceremony they then set a black porcelain cat on top of the grave as a head stone			2
but the next day the family were amazed when @entity12 scampered into their kitchen - and ate his breakfast			1
shocked mrs @entity7 believed her cat had come back from the dead and ran outside to see if he had dug himself out of the ground			1
wrong animal : @entity7 next to the grave of the black cat who she thought was her own @entity12 it was only when she found the grave still intact she realised they must have buried the wrong cat			1
she today made a sombre appeal to try and trace the owner of the cat - still buried in her back garden			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i had n't seen @entity12 all morning because he often goes roaming around			1
so i had a feeling it was him when i saw the cat by the side of the road			2
‘ it was exactly the same size , same colour and had the same face			0
we were in tears all day			0
we brought it back and buried him in bags in the bottom of our garden			0
‘ but then the next day @entity12 came wandering in and he was really grumpy because he had n't had any breakfast			1
we could n't believe it			0
we just picked him up and started cuddling him			0
‘ at first i thought he had been resurrected from the dead - but he did n't know what all the fuss was about			2
then i realised we must have had the wrong cat			0
‘ it was incredibly emotional because we had spent a whole day grieving			0
suddenly we found ourselves switching from tears of sadness to tears of joy			0
’ in a celebration of @entity12 's return on tuesday , mrs @entity7 ’s brother @entity83 , 45 , wrote and played a song to the whole family called ‘ it is the @entity87 ’			1
she added : ‘ it is all really funny but i was devastated when i found out that he had died and there must be a cat owner out there who feels like i did			0
’ mr may , who works for a youth offending service , said : ‘ i was standing at the sink making myself a drink when i heard the cat flap and just saw this tail in the conservatory			2
thought he was gone : shocked mrs @entity7 at first believed her cat had come back from the dead ‘ i said ' " is that you @entity12 ? " and he meowed back			1
he 's a very talkative cat			0
i took him up to show everyone and i said " @entity12 has risen from the dead "			1
’ she also revealed that @entity12 had previously been a notorious fighter and she had always feared that a day might come when he would n't return home			1
' at first i thought he had been resurrected from the dead - but he did n't know what all the fuss was about			2
then i realised we must have had the wrong cat ' @entity7 a year ago he broke a leg and just a month ago he received a scratch to his eye after a fight with a fellow cat			2
but now she is just happy that the cat is home and hopes that she will not have to hold another vigil anytime soon			0
mrs @entity7 , who is a store trainer at @entity121 , said : ‘ @entity12 has been in the wars in the past and has come back dragging an injured leg behind him			1
‘ he is a tom cat so just goes roaming about and pops in every now and then for some food			0
‘ but we had n't seen him for a few hours that morning and i thought he might have got in another fight or something			0
the whole family are just delighted he is home			0
