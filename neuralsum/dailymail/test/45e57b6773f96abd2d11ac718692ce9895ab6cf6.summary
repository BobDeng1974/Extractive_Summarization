a singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner			0
captured in a front room in @entity9 , @entity10 , the three dogs – a @entity7 called @entity12 , a brown and white @entity13 called @entity14 and a black and white @entity13 called @entity15 – take their positions on their make - shift stage			1
getting the tune underway , @entity14 begins barking and then rests her muzzle on @entity12 ’s ear as if whispering something – @entity12 reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction			1
the video begins with @entity14 the @entity13 barking and interacting with the @entity7 named @entity12 the @entity13 then begins barking some more and suddenly the @entity7 joins it , but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl			1
following the @entity7 ’s lead , the @entity27 begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another			2
meanwhile the other @entity13 moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner			0
no , it 's like this ! the @entity7 begins howling , causing the @entity13 to stop barking and follow its lead all together now ! the three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl , which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo			1
the trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder			0
the howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs – who continue to wag their tails – showing any signs of letting up			0
no encore ? the owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying : ‘ hey , hey , hey , come on , come on			2
’ and the three dogs , rather put out about being interrupted , stopping and turning to look at him in surprise .			0

the dogs called @entity12 , @entity14 and @entity15 each stand in the front room
@entity13 begins barking before @entity7 turns song into howl
third dog joins in with the song and the three dogs howl even louder
before owner interrupts them and they stop and stare at him in surprise
