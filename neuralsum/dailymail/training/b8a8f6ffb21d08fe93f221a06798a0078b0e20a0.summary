by @entity1 reporter published : 09:30 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 15:57 est , 1 september 2013 secretary of state @entity2 said sunday that the @entity3 now has evidence that sarin nerve gas was used in @entity6 and that ‘ the case gets stronger by the day ’ for a military attack			1
a day after president @entity9 stepped back from his threat to launch an attack , @entity2 said in a succession interviews on the sunday news shows that the administration learned of the sarin use within the past 24 hours through samples of hair and blood provided to @entity19 by first responders in @entity21			1
@entity2 said he was confident that @entity22 will give @entity9 its backing for an attack against @entity6 , but the former @entity26 senator also said the president has authority to act on his own if @entity22 does n't give its approval			1
’ @entity2 said @entity9 has the right to take action against @entity6 , with or without @entity22 ' approval			1
but he stopped short of saying @entity9 was committed to such a course even if lawmakers refuse to authorize force			2
@entity22 is scheduled to return from a summer break on sept. 9			2
@entity49 rep. @entity48 , who criticized @entity9 for not proceeding immediately against @entity50 , said the president may have trouble winning the backing of @entity22			2
‘ i think it is going to be difficult , ’ said @entity48 , a member of the @entity54 , adding that there is an ‘ isolationist ’ tendency in his @entity49 caucus			1
on an account dubbed ' the official @entity62 account for the @entity63 of the @entity6 , ' a picture was posted early sunday of @entity50 meeting with the @entity66 national security committee some 355 people showing ' neurotoxic symptoms ' died august 21 after an attack with what the @entity3 now says was likely deadly sarin gas sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , said he thinks the @entity76 ‘ will rubber - stamp what he wants but i think the @entity54 will be a much closer vote			1
’ @entity72 said he believes ‘ it 's at least 50 - 50 whether the @entity54 will vote down involvement in the @entity6 war			1
’ but rep. @entity81 , chairman of the @entity54 , called the evidence , including the fresh finding on sarin gas , ‘ convincing and getting better			1
’ @entity81 , @entity85 , predicted that ‘ at the end of the day , @entity22 will rise to the occasion , ’ but he also said ‘ it 's going to take that healthy debate to get there			1
’ ‘ this is n't about @entity9 versus the @entity22			1
this is n't about @entity91 versus @entity92			2
this has a very important worldwide reach in this decision			2
’ ' we are not going to lose this vote ' : @entity9 has asked @entity22 to vote to authorize a strike against @entity6 and @entity2 now says the case for an attack has only gotten stronger with secretary of state @entity2 's revelation sunday that @entity6 's government used the lethal nerve agent sarin gas on its own people in the august 21 attach outside @entity21 comes a worldwide			1
chemical weapons , and sarin most notably , cause an agonzing death and can be deployed over large areas with widespread casualties without regard for a victim 's age or status as a civilian			0
according to the @entity116 , chemical weapons have caused more than 1 million deaths globally since @entity118 the @entity119 , which prohibited the use of chemical weapons , was signed in 1925			0
however , the protocol did not prohibit nations from developing or stockpiling new chemical agents			0
by the @entity126 era of the 1970s and 1980s , the @entity116 estimates some 25 countries were developing chemical weapons capabilities			0
nonetheless , few instances of chemical weapons use have been seen since @entity131 notable exceptions have been seen in @entity133 and @entity66			0
since 1993 , the @entity134 has been signed by 189 nations that have agreed to a complete disarmament of chemical weapons of mass destruction			0

the @entity3 is one of 189 signers of the @entity134 , a move towards complete worldwide disarmament of such weapons deadly : a molecular model of sarin , a deadly nerve agent that kills swiftly and painfully			0
@entity152 is one of the most volatile and deadly of nerve gases @entity152 was developed as pesticide by the @entity155 in 1938			0
it has since been identified as one of the most potent and rapidly acting of the so - called nerve agents			0
this is , in part , due to how rapidly sarin evaporates into a gas and spreads into the environment			0
sarin in its vapor form causes symptoms within seconds and in its liquid form symptoms appear within minutes			0
@entity152 stops the off - switch enzyme of the body 's glands and muscles , causing them to work continuously , symptoms include : runny nose , watery eyes , pinpoint pupils , eye pain , blurred vision , drooling and excessive sweating , cough , chest tightness , rapid breathing , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , and / or abdominal pain , increased urination , confusion , drowsiness , weakness , headache , slow or fast heart rate , low or high blood pressure			1

@entity9 , who has talked repeatedly of @entity3 reprisals against president @entity50 for the alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people in @entity6 's protracted civil war , announced saturday that he had decided to defer any immediate action in order to seek a congressional authorization			0
‘ the case has n't changed and the case does n't change at all			1
the rationale for a military response is as powerful today ’ as it has been , @entity2 said			1
‘ this case is going to build stronger and stronger , ’ he said			1
but he also said he thinks ‘ the people of @entity3 should be celebrating that the president is not acting unilaterally			2
’ @entity2 maintained there is no weakness in the @entity3 case underscoring @entity9 's about - face , saying instead that ‘ the president believes that we are all stronger as a nation when we act together			1
’ the secretary said that @entity50 ‘ has now joined the list of @entity224 and @entity225 ’ in deploying chemical weapons against his population and that ‘ the case remains the same ’ for a @entity3 response			1
@entity2 echoed @entity9 in saying the world can not stand by and watch @entity50 use chemical weapons			0

... but it is confirmation of the signatures of sarin			0
’ ‘ in the last 24 hours , ’ he said , ‘ we have learned through samples that were provided to the @entity3 , that have now been tested , from first responders in east @entity21 , and hair samples and blood samples have tested positive for signatures of sarin			1
’ he was asked repeatedly what @entity9 would do in the event that @entity22 refuses to give its consent , @entity2 said , ‘ the president has taken his decision			1
’ ‘ i think this is a smart decision by the president			1
... he is not trying to create an imperial presidency , ’ @entity2 added			2
‘ i believe that in the end , @entity22 will do what is right			2
