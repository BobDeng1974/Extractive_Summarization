@entity1 manager @entity0 has revealed that new @entity4 signing @entity2 refused to believe him when he told him he was going on loan to @entity6			1
@entity4 produced perhaps the shock of a generally unremarkable transfer deadline day on monday when they plucked @entity2 from @entity1 's reserves at 10.55pm on a deal until the end of the season			1
it is understood that @entity4 will use the 21 - year - old – who only has four first - team appearances for @entity1 – in their under 21 squad after allowing @entity19 @entity18 to move to @entity20 earlier in the day			1
@entity4 stunned their supporters by signing @entity22 defender @entity2 on loan the 21 - year - old has only made a handful of appearances for the @entity1 first team @entity2 spent time on loan at @entity29 earlier this season but @entity0 revealed the morning after that he will always remember the reaction of the youngster when he was called in to be told the news on monday night			1
' he thought he was going to @entity29 but we told him he was going to @entity4 , ' said @entity0			1
' he did n't believe us			0
he was like : " no way "			0
' he rang his dad and i think his dad had to have a sit down			0
' his mate came in with him at the same time and he was actually wearing a @entity4 track suit			2
' but it 's an opportunity of a life time for him			2
it is understood that @entity2 will spend the duration of his loan playing for @entity4 's @entity46 side @entity1 manager @entity0 described the move as an opportunity of a lifetime for @entity2 ' i have known [ @entity4 reserve coach ] @entity51 has liked @entity2 for a while			1
' we have been looking for pace in the team so [ chairman ] @entity53 got on the phone to @entity4 and asked if we could take @entity59 and they said we could if they could take @entity2			1
' it 's a good move for us and a fantastic opportunity for @entity2			1
' @entity2 's last game for @entity1 was in the 4 - 2 defeat at @entity64 that followed the club 's goalless draw at @entity67 in the @entity68			1
the defender was taken off after 50 minutes with the score at 3 - 0			2
' we used @entity2 the other week at @entity64 , and it was a difficult game to come into after @entity67 and did n't play as well as we had hoped , ' added @entity0			1
as part of the deal , 19 - year - old midfielder @entity59 will move the other way ' but he has been in the first - team squad since he came back from @entity29 [ where he had been on loan ] and they were very keen to take him back again			1
' but then this came up			0
' @entity1 face @entity67 in the @entity68 replay at their own @entity81 on tuesday night after a transfer deadline day that saw them complete a number of deals			1
' it was a good day for us , ' added @entity0			2
' it was good to get home at midnight and have a lie down			0
when @entity92 reported the signing on @entity95 coverage , @entity91 went into meltdown			0
surely this was some mistake ? this was not a @entity99 or a @entity100			0
across the country , bemused @entity4 fans rewound their tvs and wnt straight to @entity105			2
sure enough , abut half an hour after the deadline came confirmation via a tweet from @entity4 's official account to their 4.35m followers			1
the club had brought in @entity2 on loan for the rest of the season with under 21 right back @entity59 going the other way			1
but why ? it 's a good question			0
some would wonder about the logic behind sending one of your own players out on loan and bringing another in on loan			0
but there is method in the madness			0
@entity4 are keen to get as many of their own youngsters out into the big bad world of men 's football			1
they want them toughened up and introduced to a level of aggression rarely seen in the under 21 league			0
officials will hope @entity59 's footballing education will be furthered in the @entity135			0
departures like this , however , leave their own under 21 side short of numbers			2
manager @entity51 is known to believe that there are many unearthed gems in the lower leagues			0
he is known as a coach who sees things in players that others do not			0
this would appear to be the case with @entity2			2
so what 's his pedigree ? he 's @entity1 - born , 21 and a left back			1
a product of the club 's academy he has made four first - team appearances and earned a loan move to @entity29 in october			1
while at the @entity158 side he scored a wonder goal at @entity160 and was described as a solid performer by fans			0
how did the move come about ? @entity4 had to fight off interest from @entity29 ( not a sentence you often write ) to bring him to @entity6			2
the @entity167 spoke to first - team coach @entity168 who relayed the amusing moment when the news was broken to the youngster			0
' sit down , ' he said , before adding that they had some ' good news and bad news '			0
@entity2 opted for the bad news and was told he was not going to @entity176			1
presumably fearing the worst he tentatively enquired as to what the good news was			0
' you 're going to @entity4 , ' was the response			0
what can we expect ? in an interview with fans site @entity1 , @entity2 says he models himself on @entity186 and likes to get forward when he can and play on the wing			1
former wanderers boss @entity188 was impressed and made him the first @entity1 - born youth product to start for the club in eight years after he overcame what the @entity191 described as off - the - field attitude issues			2
@entity194 has seen him in action and is impressed , and with @entity197 's history of giving youth a chance , who knows what will happen next ?			0

@entity4 signed @entity2 on loan for the rest of the season
defender did not believe @entity1 when they broke the news to him
it is believed @entity2 will be used by @entity4 's @entity46 side
@entity0 said it is a great opportunity for the 21 - year - old
