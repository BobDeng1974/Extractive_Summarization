by @entity0 as scientists mark the 45th year since the @entity4 lunar landing , a lesser known anniversary last week quietly passed the world by			0
almost one hundred years ago today , @entity7 - born @entity6 received a revolutionary patent for a liquid - fuelled rocket			1
the patent , which was ridiculed by journalists at the time , paved the way for the @entity14 moon landings and helped bring about the dawn of the ‘ space age ’			1
pictured is dr @entity19 ’s first patent for a multi-stage rocket which was received on july 7 , 1914 dr @entity19 was advocated exploring space with rockets , for which he was ridiculed , which turned @entity6 into something of a recluse dr @entity6 - today considered the father of modern rocket propulsion – was a modest man who went largely unrecognised for his early work			1
he first caught the attention of academics as a student in 1907 after a cloud of smoke from a powder rocket fired in the basement of the @entity38 physics building			0
in 1914 , @entity6 received two @entity40 patents			0
one was for a rocket using liquid fuel			2
the other was for a two - or three - stage rocket using solid fuel			2
dr @entity6 ’s liquid - fuelled rocket , patented july 14 , 1914			1
by 1916 , he had developed the mathematical theories of rocket propulsion dr @entity19 , in @entity50 truck , tows a rocket to its launch site 15 miles northwest of @entity53 , @entity54 by 1916 , he had developed the mathematical theories of rocket propulsion			1
toward the end of a 1920 report , dr @entity6 outlined the possibility of a rocket reaching the moon and exploding a load of flash powder there to mark its arrival			2
the media picked up @entity6 ’s scientific proposal about a rocket flight to the moon , however , and created a journalistic controversy concerning the feasibility of such a thing			2
@entity71 , writing for the @entity74 blog , notes that the @entity75 ridiculed his ideas about rocketry at the time			2
on the left is dr @entity6 with his complete rocket in 1925			0
his ideas helped launch the @entity4 spacecraft 45 years ago ( right ) a close - up of a gyroscope on one of @entity19 's @entity54 rockets			1
the gyroscope was used in stabilisation they said , his claim that a rocket could fly in the vacuum of space would ‘ deny a fundamental law of dynamics , and only dr @entity90 and his chosen dozen , so few and fit , are licensed to do that			1
' however , by 1926 , dr @entity6 had constructed and successfully tested the first rocket using liquid fuel based on these patents			0
for astronomers , the flight of dr @entity6 ’s rocket on march 16 , 1926 , at @entity103 , @entity7 , was as significant to history as that of the @entity109 brother ’s first flight			0
as @entity4 was racing moonward , the @entity75 published a correction : ' further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of @entity114 in the @entity115 and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere			0
the @entity75 regrets the error			0
as dr @entity6 once said : ‘ it is difficult to say what is impossible , for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow			0
’ dr @entity6 ( 1882 – 1945 ) explored the practicality of using rocket propulsion to reach high altitudes , even the moon ( 1912 ) proved that a rocket will work in a vacuum , that it needs no air to push against developed and fired a liquid fuel rocket ( march 16 , 1926 , @entity103 , @entity135 ) shot a scientific payload in a rocket flight ( 1929 , @entity103 , @entity135 ) used vanes in the rocket motor blast for guidance ( 1932 , @entity54 ) developed gyro control apparatus for rocket flight ( 1932 , @entity54 ) received @entity40 patent for of multi-stage rocket ( 1914 ) developed pumps suitable for rocket fuels launched a rocket with a motor pivoted on gimbals under the influence of a gyro mechanism ( 1937 ) source : @entity153			1

100 years ago , @entity19 received a patent for a liquid - fuelled rocket
the patent paved the way for the @entity14 moon landings and the ‘ space age ’
however , it was ridiculed by the media at the time who said his ideas would ' deny a fundamental law of dynamics '
