by @entity0 published : 12:53 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:44 est , 5 december 2012 a liver transplant patient was sewn up with an @entity3 - sized piece of surgical equipment left inside him , after a series of medical blunders			1
@entity8 , 49 , received a new liver at @entity10 in @entity11 , but was sent home with a silicone mat still inside him			1
it was only discovered after mr @entity8 complained of suffering from a lot of pain following surgery			1
doctors performed a ct scan three weeks later and decided to operate after spotting something unusual			1
mr @entity8 was shocked to be told they had discovered the equipment inside him following the operation			1
surgeon and assistant performing operation ( posed by models ) he has now won £ 7,000 in compensation from the @entity30			1
the award comes after @entity32 ’s was heavily criticised by health watchdog monitor , which cited a series of so - called ‘ never events ’ - incidents that simply should n't happen - as one of its major failings			1
personal injury lawyers @entity40 and @entity42 said the ordeal had been ' incredibly stressful ' for their @entity45 - based client and could have put his health at risk			2
mr @entity8 had a lapromat - a fish - shaped piece of silicon - inserted during surgery just before closure of the abdominal wall and designed to prevent inadvertant puncture of the bowel			1
the lapromat acts as a kind of protective shield and should be removed before surgery is completed			2
mr @entity8 was treated at @entity10 in @entity59 ( pictured ) which has been criticised by the health watchdog monitor @entity63 , principal lawyer at @entity64 , told @entity65 : ' the hospital 's own investigation says that the cause of the incident was the failure correctly to record that an item from the instrument set was in use , not recognising that it had not been removed and failure correctly to complete the count at the end of the procedure			1
' the normal rule is - count in , count out			2
the root cause was said to be the breakdown of routine checking procedures			2
in other words this was not , like most surgical mistakes , an error of judgment in the exercise of a difficult skill but really basic carelessness			1
' i deal with medical negligence claims day in day out			2
in my experience mistakes quite as blatant as this are extremely rare			0
' a fish - shaped lapromat , like the one pictured , was left inside mr @entity8 @entity98 , from the same firm , added : ' when we go to hospital for surgery , we rightly expect the highest standards of healthcare and professionalism			1
these standards were not upheld when @entity8 had his liver transplant at @entity32 ’s			1
' the award of compensation is a relief for someone whose health could have been endangered by this carelessness			1
' we hope that the resolution of this case , as well of those of others who have brought actions against @entity30 , will serve to protect patients in the future			0
' a spokesman for @entity32 ’s said : ' we deeply regret this incident and have apologised to the patient			2
' dr @entity123 said the new rules will increase patient confidence healthcare providers will be contractually obliged to admit when they have made medical blunders that put patients at risk , it has been announced			0
from april next year @entity133 organisations will be forced to be transparent about breaches of patient safety , health minister dr @entity123 said.the new rules will increase patient confidence , he said			0
ensuring staff across the health service are truthful is ' crucial ' to delivering the highest standards of care , he added			0
at present , the @entity133 is expected to be truthful about mistakes but there is no contractual obligation to stop cover - ups			2
' patients place great faith in the @entity133 organisations that treat them , and they in turn have a duty to be honest and open about every aspect of care they deliver , ' dr @entity123 said			0
' when mistakes are made , we want them acknowledged , patients informed and lessons to be learnt			0
' the importance of an open culture can not be underestimated			0
we expect that @entity159 will make further recommendations on the duty of candour when the @entity163 is published , and we are committed to taking whatever further action we think is needed as a result			0
' but we can not wait - creating this contractual duty of candour now ensures that @entity133 contracts for the next financial year will champion patients ’ rights to basic honesty , as well as safe care			1
' @entity172 , chief executive of the charity , @entity174 or @entity175 , said : ' this appears to be a cynical attempt by the @entity178 to sidestep overwhelming pressure from patients ’ groups and others for a statutory duty of candour and pre-empt recommendations from the @entity163 which are likely to recommend a statutory duty			0
' no one should be taken in by this			0
we do not object to a standard clause in @entity133 trusts ’ contracts , but what the government is saying is that it does not see a duty of candour as one of the ‘ essential standards of quality and safety ’ which all health organisations need to satisfy in order to be registered with the @entity201 ( @entity201 )			0
' it clearly should be , as this would give the @entity201 statutory power to insist upon and enforce it			0
it is simply wrong to relegate such a fundamental issue to a standard clause in @entity133 trusts ’ contracts			0

@entity8 , 49 , had a ct scan three weeks after his liver transplant after he complained of pain
a second operation revealed that a silicone mat had been left inside him during the earlier operation
it was a ' never event ' - a hospital incident that should never happen
lawyer who won him £ 7,000 compensation said it had been ' basic carelessness '
