from @entity1 to @entity2 , @entity0 showcased some envy - inducing outfits in 2014			1
while she has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a @entity9 cover - the reality tv star has revealed that she 's having a style overhaul for the coming year			1
writing on her @entity12 , the mother - of - one said : ' up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with @entity16 ...			1
. i 'm so ready for new looks for the @entity18 ! new 2015 vision			0
' @entity0 , who has recently made a name for herself in the high fashion world , has revealed that she 's having a style overhaul for the coming year with the help of husband @entity16 as she signalled the end of a stylish year , the 34 - year - old made sure to credit her favourite outfit of the year			1
' this @entity1 look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014 , ' she captioned a photo of herself wearing the black lace dress and leather jacket at @entity31			1
of course , her new husband @entity16 has played a large part in her style transformation			2
@entity0 has spoken on many occasions about the rapper - come - designer 's influence on her wardrobe choices			1
last year , @entity16 introduced his wife to fashion label @entity40 - and she loved it so much she wore it twice in four days			1
writing on her @entity12 , the mother - of - one explained : ' up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with @entity16 ...			1
i 'm so ready for new looks for the @entity18 ! new 2015 vision ' the 34 - year - old made sure to credit her favourite outfit of the year posting a snap on @entity12 with the caption : ' this @entity1 look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014 ' @entity0 has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper and designer 's influence over her wardrobe choices			1
@entity58 , pictured at the @entity60 awards in a daring custom - designed haute couture gunmetal skirt by @entity62 , with an @entity64 latex bodysuit with @entity66 heels , and , right , at @entity31 in @entity67 , both in september the brand , which is actually run by @entity70 designer and @entity72 former fashion director , @entity71 , was discovered online by @entity0 's husband , mr @entity16			1
' he researches everything and he loves to find new talent , and he introduced me to her and told me she ’s part @entity77 , and so am i , ' @entity0 told @entity79			2
' i ’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it ’s really important to me to support designers that i believe in and friends that i believe in that are hardworking			0
' in one episode of @entity86 , @entity16 is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look			0
and it seemed his help worked - just less than a year after the @entity94 shoot and @entity0 , who was heavily pregnant with @entity96 at the time , showed the first signs of being ingratiated into the fashion world			1
@entity0 , wearing a @entity101 blazer , and rapper @entity16 attend the @entity101 show as part of the @entity31 - one of many of the shows at which the power couple sat in the front row she was asked by @entity108 , the former editor of @entity9 , to cover her @entity110 book			1
@entity0 was photographed for the cover picture by @entity2 's @entity112 and the shoot was art directed by @entity115			0
it was a controversial choice at the time , but that worked in @entity0 's favour , as @entity108 later explained to @entity119			0
she said : ' she ’s controversial , but so was @entity120 and i always like controversial people			0
' she went on to praise the reality star , saying : ' she was brave ... with @entity112 shooting			0
' she had one guy for hair , one guy for make - up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked , and she accepted everything			0
' i do n’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – i ’ve never seen her in a @entity135 jumpsuit or a basketball jacket , but she said yes to everything			0
@entity0 arrives to promote her new fragrance @entity139 in 2014 - and her latex outfit by @entity64 caused a stir pals with @entity143 : before she found global fame , @entity0 worked as @entity146 's stylist and personal shopper			1
she also worked with @entity148 ' she was the easiest model we ’ve had			0
and when we put a mask on her face , she did n’t say anything			0
' it was following @entity96 's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular @entity0 was becoming with the world 's biggest fashion houses though , from the flood of designers that sent clothes for her new arrival , all duly documented on @entity0 's instagram page			1
from @entity1 to @entity164 and @entity165 to @entity166 , @entity0 shared photographs of @entity96 's adorable new wardrobe , signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her			1
the biggest coup came in april 2014 though , when she and @entity16 landed a joint @entity9 cover ahead of their may wedding			1
the news caused outrage among some of the magazine 's subscribers , but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year			0
that magazine sold 500,000 copies , beating both @entity185 and @entity187 's @entity9 covers			2
not her best : @entity0 was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits like the gold cocktail dress she wore at the @entity194 awards in 2008 , left , and , right , in 2010 at the @entity196 jewellery launch @entity197 said of the cover : ' part of the pleasure of editing @entity9 , one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine , is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment , who stir things up , whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it			1
' i think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by @entity0 and @entity16 to a @entity219 ' as for the cover , my opinion is that it is both charming and touching , and it was , i should add , entirely our idea to do it ; you may have read that @entity16 begged me to put his fiancée on @entity9 's cover			1
' he did nothing of the sort			0
the gossip might make better reading , but the simple fact of the matter is that it is n't true			0
' since then , @entity0 has sat from row ( with @entity96 in tow ) at some of the biggest shows at fashion week			0
she also became part of @entity241 's @entity67 army , later posing as a model for him			2
@entity0 and @entity16 covered the april 2014 issue of @entity9 having won the approval of editor @entity197 @entity0 now counts designers like @entity112 and @entity247 as friends and is regularly pictured on nights out with supermodels like @entity251 and @entity252			1
@entity0 is most certainly starting the @entity18 off in style after being announced as the face of the new issue of fashion bible love magazine , complete with edgy bleached brows			2
this undoubtedly signaled the end of her transformation from super eek to super chic			0
the metamorphosis has been no mean feat , for while she might now be a firm favourite with designers , @entity0 's initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for none other than @entity146 and @entity148			1
in fact , a pre-fame , @entity0 also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and troubled film star			0
it was n't just her lack of a-list quality that forced @entity0 into the fashion doldrums though , despite her day job , back in the mid-noughties , her personal style left a lot to be desired			2
to say @entity0 has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent fashion weeks , like here wearing @entity165 , she has been front row in @entity143 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 from bright gold dresses to garish satin , she rarely made a ' best - dressed ' list in the early part of her career			2
but fast forward nearly ten years and it 's a completely different story			0
to say @entity0 has become a darling in the fashion world would be somewhat of an understatement - in recent fashion weeks she has been front row in @entity143 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291			2
it has n't been an easy transition though , for a long time @entity0 was shunned by the designers who now adore her			2
just over two years ago , during a photoshoot for @entity94 at the end of 2012 , many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star			2
@entity311 , artistic director at @entity312 , styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high - end samples was a ' challenge			1
' he said : ' people would n’t lend me the clothes			0
but that ’s fashion snobbery			0
' @entity311 , who is now good friends with @entity0 , revealed that the top designers did n't want their designs featured on a woman who had , ' less - than - model - like - proportions			2
' however , he rightfully predicted at the time , ' she 's not the it girl yet , but she will be			0
' it truly seems @entity311 's prediction has come true ... @entity0 has become the ultimate fashion it girl .			0

the 34 - year - old says husband is helping her curate new wardrobe
he has introduced her to high - end designers
