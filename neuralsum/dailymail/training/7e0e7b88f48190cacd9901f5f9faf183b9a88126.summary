rejecting criticism that he had failed to expose sex abuse allegations against 29 - stone @entity2 , who died in 2010 , @entity0 revealed he had confronted the paedophile politician over his ' unusual behavior ' at a hostel in @entity11 in the 1970s			1
in an extraordinary defence of his own - and the @entity1 ’s - conduct concerning the serial sex abuser , the peer again insisted he knew nothing else of @entity2 ’s vile activities			1
claims : ex-liberal leader @entity0 ( right ) @entity0 said there ' is no question ' @entity2 ( left ) would be ' up for assault now ' , but argued that at the time corporal punishment ' went on ' @entity0 claimed he confronted @entity2 over his behaviour at the @entity11 care home in 1979 , after an article in @entity25 detailed how the @entity1 mp spanked young boys ’ bare bottoms			1
the magazine had reported on an investigation published by the @entity30 which detailed claims made by a number of young men about @entity2 spanking boys			1
@entity0 said he confronted @entity2 over his ' unusual behavior ' at a hostel in @entity11 ' i asked @entity2 about it			1
i was half expecting him to say it was all wrong and i would have been expecting him to sue to save his reputation			0
to my surprise he said the report was correct , ' @entity41 quoted him as saying			0
' he had some kind of supervisory role , i do n't know what it was , in these institutions in @entity11 , which he reckoned entitled him to be involved in corporal punishment , ' @entity0 added			2
claiming the @entity11 hostel report was the extent of his knowledge of @entity2 's abusive behaviour , @entity0 said : ‘ all i knew was what was in @entity25			1
any member of the public could know that			0
' @entity0 , who led the @entity58 between 1976 and 1988 , said there ‘ is no question he would be up for assault now ’ but compared the child abuse claims to corporal punishment in schools			1
‘ we have to remember that this was a different era			0
it would be totally illegal now , there is no question he would be up for assault now			0
in those days it went on ' , he said			0
@entity2 died in 2010 and two years later @entity73 began investigating claims he abused boys while secretary of @entity77 in the 1960s			1
the allegations related to a time in the 1960s when @entity2 was a @entity81 councillor and had not yet entered @entity82			2
@entity0 insisted that he had ‘ no locus ’ in the affair			2
he told @entity85 's @entity86 : ‘ we are a political party , not a detective agency			0
’ but he said he would not have recommended @entity2 for a knighthood in 1988 if he had had ‘ the slightest inkling ’ of allegations that he abused young men while an mp			1
allegations : @entity0 claimed he was only aware of a @entity25 article in 1979 detailing how the 29 - stone monster spanked young boys ' bare bottoms @entity0 said that he found @entity2 's reported behaviour ‘ odd ’ , but added : ‘ the fact is these were allegations that were 10 - 15 years old			1
‘ i had no locus in the matter at all			0
he was n't even a member of my party at that time			2
’ asked if he had considered launching an internal party inquiry , @entity0 replied : ‘ why should i ? there was no allegation about his behaviour as an mp			2
‘ there are now allegations which have come to light since his death			0
these were very serious , but they were not known to us at the time			0
’ probe : on monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover - up of @entity2 's activities in @entity11 @entity0 said that the @entity25 report led to ‘ gossip and tittle - tattle ’ in the @entity124 , but insisted that there was no firm allegation about his behaviour as an mp			1
‘ idle gossip is not a basis for any inquiry at all , ’ he said			0
‘ not a single story emerged , not even a rumour emerged about him misbehaving as an mp			2
if that had happened , of course i would have inquired			0
‘ if i had had the slightest inkling that that was going on , of course i would have taken action , but these were old allegations , publicly acknowledged , which the police had investigated			0
’ @entity0 said it was for the police and not the @entity141 to explain why no action was taken on the initial allegations .			2

former @entity1 leader insists he did not know about sex abuse claims
but admits he once confronted 29 - stone mp over rumour he spanked boys
@entity25 reported on investigation into allegations made by young men
lord @entity155 said he was surprised when @entity2 *confirmed* the story as true
@entity2 was allowed to continue as member of @entity1 despite claims
@entity0 said although spanking is assault now , at the time it was *normal*
