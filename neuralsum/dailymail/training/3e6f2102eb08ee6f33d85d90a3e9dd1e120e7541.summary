the @entity8 155 has been under development for 18 months , and will cost a total of £ 32million when it is finally completed			1
this week it was taken out of the shed in @entity12 , @entity13 where it is being built , as it is now too large to be housed in the hangar			2
unveiled : the @entity8 superyacht , commissioned by @entity5 , has been unveiled to the public under construction : the boat has been moved out of the shed where it was built because it is now too large it was transported at a glacial place by a radio - controlled unit as it was manoeuvred out of the shed with just a few inches to spare			1
the four - deck yacht includes five bedrooms , enabling mr @entity5 to host up to 10 guests at once , while the boat also has space for 11 members of staff			1
other perks include a nightclub , day room , ' beach club ' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the @entity41 if mr @entity5 decides to attend the society event			1
the yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes , with a maximum speed of 22 knots ( 25mph ) , and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey			2
new owner : @entity5 , pictured with @entity48 , is paying £ 32million for the @entity8 emerging : the yacht was taken out of the shed on a radio - controlled system plans : these floor plans show the layout of the yacht , which includes five guest bedrooms and a nightclub @entity57 , the company building the boat , expects to be able to begin testing it on the water next month , before delivering it to mr @entity5 in the spring			1
but even after the businessman has taken delivery of his new pride and joy , handing over £ 32million in the process , the @entity8 will not come cheap			1
filling up the boat 's 60,000 - litre engine with diesel will cost £ 30,000 every time			2
despite the gigantic scale of the @entity8 , it is still very far from the record for the biggest yacht in the world - the @entity75 , completed last year , measures almost 600ft			0
glamorous : but the boat has a top speed of just 22 knots ( 25mph ) due to its vast size vast : however , the 155ft yacht is still some way off the world record , which stands at a staggering 600ft @entity83 , managing director at @entity57 , said : ' this is an extremely exciting time for @entity57 as we inch ever closer to the completion of the @entity87			2
' this is the biggest project we have ever undertaken and since the announcement of its build it has been the talk of the industry			0
' we are incredibly proud of what we have created and look forward to showcasing it to the world			0
' mr @entity5 , who commissioned the yacht , grew up in @entity98 and ran a number of racing teams before setting up @entity101 , whose drivers included @entity103 and @entity104			1
after the team shut down in 2005 , the 65 - year - old became a racing commentator for the @entity108			2
last year it was revealed that the @entity111 royal family own the world 's biggest mega-yacht , knocking @entity115 oligarch @entity114 's off the top spot			0
the @entity119 owner 's vessel @entity120 had been the world 's biggest yacht for the past three years , but it was usurped by the 590ft @entity75 , which @entity123 revealed belongs to @entity124 , president of the @entity111 and @entity125 and is worth £ 390million			0
the yacht requires a staff of 50 , and interior features include a 29ft salon and a stunning , open - plan interior			0
@entity114 's @entity120 , valued at £ 740million , features an armour - plated master suite , two swimming pools , two helipads , a hall , a cinema , a mini-submarine and even its own missile defence system			0
it had in turn taken the title of world 's biggest private yacht from the 454ft @entity142 , owned by @entity144 businessman @entity143 , which topped the @entity146 , owned by @entity148 co-founder @entity147			0
of the top 100 yachts featured in the @entity123 mega yacht league table , 31 were owned by people from the @entity152 , 19 were @entity115 owned , and 17 belonged to @entity144 .			0
